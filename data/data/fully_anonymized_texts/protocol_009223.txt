2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and heterogeneous endocrine and metabolic disorder 
characterized by [CONTACT_642426]-anovulation, androgen excess, and polycystic ovaries.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_642405], few therapeutic options are available for women with PCOS.
Elagolix sodium (hereinafter "elagolix,") is an oral, short-acting, nonpeptide, gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) antagonist that competitively inhibits the GnRH receptors in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_304].  Elagolix, unlike injectable GnRH analogs, produces a dose-dependent suppression of pi[INVESTIGATOR_112697], i.e., from partial ovarian suppression at lower doses to nearly full suppression at higher doses.  A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of elagolix in humans and a summary of clinical studies can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

Elagolix has the potential to improve the disordered pi[INVESTIGATOR_642406].
Clinical Hypothesis
Elagolix will lower luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion while maintaining follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion and consequently:
1. Lower serum testosterone concentrations
2. Restore normal menstrual cycles in women with PCOS
3. Improve ovulation4. Improve hyperandrogenic symptoms
2.[ADDRESS_859697] symptoms of oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, and anovulation due to excess LH 
secretion.  Elagolix has the potential to improve this symptom complex by [CONTACT_642427] a normal LH/FSH ratio.  Preliminary data show that at low doses of elagolix, LH is preferentially inhibited compared with FSH.  As of [ADDRESS_859698] been exposed to elagolix; the safety profile of elagolix is well established even at doses higher than those planned for administration in this study.  Thus, the benefit/risk profile for the study is favorable.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the elagolix 
Investigator's Brochure.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Considering the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study has been re-evaluated.  Based on the limited information to date, no additional risk to study participants is anticipated with the use of elagolix.
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
3.1 Objectives
The objective of the study is to assess the PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and efficacy of elagolix in women with PCOS.
3.2 Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is the proportion of menstrual cycle responders.
3.3 Key Secondary Endpoint
Change from Baseline to Week 1 in the area under the LH serum concentration-time curve (AUC).
3.[ADDRESS_859699] 2 ovulations during the Treatment Period8. Endpoints related to hyperandrogenism – Patient Global Impression (PGI) for both acne and 
hirsutism; change from Baseline at each scheduled assessment during the Treatment Period for 
the following:  acne measured with total lesion count and investigator's global assessment (IGA), hirsutism measured with Ferriman–Gallwey (FG) score
9. Endpoints related to metabolic features - change from Baseline at each scheduled assessment 
during the Treatment Period for the following:  glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting insulin/glucose, body mass index (BMI), lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], waist circumference
10. Change from Baseline at each scheduled assessment during the Treatment Period for additional 
hormones:  androstenedione, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), estradiol (E2), progesterone
Page 8 of 90
STUDY M16-837  |  Version 4.[ADDRESS_859700]'s quality of life:  change from Baseline in domains from the 
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire (PCOSQ) (emotions, body hair, weight, infertility 
problems, and menstrual problems) and the Menstrual Bleeding Questionnaire (MBQ) at each scheduled assessment during the Treatment Period.
3.5 Safety Endpoints
Safety evaluations include physical examination, vital signs, pelvic ultrasound (includes both transabdominal ultrasound [TAU] and transvaginal ultrasound [TVU]), MRI (if required), clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and lipid panel), bone mineral density (BMD) via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) examinations, and adverse event (AE) monitoring for 
the entire study duration.
3.6 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Plasma concentrations of elagolix will be determined at designated visits, and the concentrations may be used to develop a population PK model.  The population PK model may be linked with data from the PD endpoints for PK/PD analyses.
3.7 Pharmacodynamic Endpoints
LH and FSH concentrations will be determined at designated visits throughout the study and summarized.  Serum AUC
0-tof LH and FSH will be calculated using non-compartmental methods and 
summarized.  Serum concentrations of other endocrine hormones may be determined and summarized if useful for the interpretation of the study results.  Additional PD parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the study results.
3.8 Biomarker Sampling
Optional whole blood, serum, and plasma samples will be collected at specified time points ( Appendix 
D) throughout the study to evaluate known and/or novel disease-related or drug-related biomarkers.  
Types of biomarkers may include nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and/or metabolites.  The objective of this research is to analyze samples for biomarkers that may help to understand PCOS, related conditions, and the subject's response to elagolix.  Research may also include epi[INVESTIGATOR_642407] (DNA) that may associate with the subject's response to treatment or disease.  Samples for ribonucleic acid (RNA) may be used to research if any genetic variants result in changes to gene expression.  This research is exploratory in nature and the results may not be included with the clinical study report.

4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind (sponsor-unblinded), 6-month, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group, multicenter study designed to assess the PK and PD of elagolix and to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of elagolix in women with PCOS.
The duration of the study could be up to 42 weeks, which includes an 8-week Washout (if necessary), a 
6-week Screening Period, a 24-week Treatment Period, and a 30-day Post-Treatment Follow-up Period.
The Screening Period may be extended in certain circumstances (e.g., repeat TVU is needed) following 
consultation with the sponsor. 
Study Visits and Assessments:  Study visits for safety, efficacy, PK, and PD assessments will be scheduled 
as listed in the activity schedule ( Appendix D ).  Sites will have the option to participate in sparse PK 
sampling of elagolix.  Optional sparse PK sampling will take place on the scheduled visits at Week 1 and 
Week 4 of the Treatment Period, as listed on the activity schedule ( Appendix D ), and includes 5 lab 
draws over 6 hours.  If sites choose not to participate in the optional sparse PK sampling, a single PK 
sample will be required at the scheduled visits.  At other study visits (other than the optional sparse PK sampling study visits), a single PK sample will be collected as per the activity schedule.
Required intensive PD sampling of LH and FSH will occur at Baseline, and the scheduled visits at Week 1, 
Week 4, and Week 16 of the Treatment Period, as listed on the activity schedule ( Appendix D ).  Required 
intensive PD sampling includes 7 to 9 lab draws over 3 to 4 hours (taken every 30 minutes).  At other study visits (other than intensive PD study visits), a single PD sample will be collected, per the activity schedule.
Washout Period for subjects on oral contraceptives (OCPs):  a 2-month Washout Period will be required 
for subjects who are on OCPs.  Washout Period for subjects on metformin:  a 1-month Washout Period will be required for subjects on metformin.  A full list of Washout Periods for other medications is presented in Table [ADDRESS_859701] will complete an electronic 
daily bleeding diary.  The subjects will also undergo weekly blood draws for progesterone levels.  A progesterone level ≥ 3 ng/mL will be used to indicate ovulation.
Subjects will undergo procedures and activities as listed in the Activities Schedule at the 30-day post-treatment follow-up visit.  An unscheduled visit may occur when the subject returns to the clinic at any time for the evaluation of symptoms, changes in concomitant medications, or any AEs.
The study schematic is presented in Figure 1 .  Further details regarding study procedures are located in 
the Operations Manual ( Appendix F ).  See Section 5for information regarding eligibility criteria.  Study 
sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the study.

Some of the study visits and visit activities (including but not limited to clinical laboratory tests and 
concomitant medication assessment) may be conducted in the home or non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic environment by [CONTACT_642428]'s request and with the subject's agreement where local regulation allows.
Rescreening
Subjects who screen fail for this study may be rescreened.  Prior to rescreening a subject, the investigator should consult with the [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD).  The TA MD will determine which procedures will need to be repeated if the subject was a screen failure for this study or another [COMPANY_013] elagolix study.  The subject must re-consent and meet all eligibility criteria at the time of rescreening to qualify for the study.

Page 11 of 90
STUDY M16-837  |  Version 4.[ADDRESS_859703] Population
Women 18 to 35 years of age with PCOS are selected for this study.  The lower age limit (18 years) was 
chosen based on the youngest adult age; the upper age limit (35 years) was chosen in order to limit the study to women earlier in the disease process.  No studies in females outside of the reproductive years are necessary for this proposed indication.
This study will enrich for subjects who have PCOS with menstrual abnormalities and hyperandrogenic 
features by [CONTACT_642429].
Selection of Doses in the Study
The effects of elagolix on gonadotropic and ovarian hormones were evaluated in premenopausal healthy women in 2 Phase 1 studies over 21 days in a multiple-ascending dose study (Study M12-790), and over a period of 3 months in a folliculogenesis study (Study M12-673).  In these studies, the evaluated elagolix dosages ranged from 100 mg once daily (QD) to 400 mg twice daily (BID).  In the 21-day multiple-ascending dose study, dose-dependent suppression of gonadotropic and ovarian 
hormones was observed.  Based on the results from the 2 studies, elagolix exhibited partial suppression 
of LH up to 100 mg BID (200 mg total daily dose), and near maximal suppression at 200 mg BID and higher.  However, elagolix showed differential FSH suppression compared with LH, where no or minimal suppression was observed up to 200 mg total daily dose and near maximal or maximal suppression at 200 mg BID and higher.  In the 3-month folliculogenesis study, ovulatory progesterone concentrations (> 5 nmol/L) were observed more often at lower elagolix dosages (100 to 200 mg QD, 100 mg BID) correlating with higher ovulation rates.  In Study M12-790, when the same total daily dose was evaluated as QD or BID (i.e., 100 mg BID versus 200 mg QD), BID regimens appeared to provide more suppression of hormones compared with QD regimens.  Testosterone suppression was also observed with elagolix dosages (100 mg BID, 200 mg BID, and 300 mg BID).
Based on the totality of the data from the Phase 1 and exploratory dose-response modeling, a total daily 
dose range of 50 mg to 300 mg with various dosing regimens (i.e., QD and BID) would provide an opportunity to study and explore a dose range finding in women with PCOS by [CONTACT_642430].  The lowest effective dose that would allow establishment or improvement in menstrual regularity is desired.  The upper dose range in the study would also allow evaluation of maximum ability of elagolix to achieve improvement in hyperandrogenic features.
[ADDRESS_859704] has voluntarily signed and dated the informed consent form (ICF), approved by [CONTACT_51277] (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC), prior to any study-specific procedures including washout or screening procedures.

A thorough investigation of potential etiologies for the elevated transaminases should be conducted (e.g., trauma, acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, alcohol ingestion), and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression.
Subjects for whom treatment is discontinued for elevated hepatic function tests should have 
transaminases and bilirubin levels repeated by [CONTACT_66768] [ADDRESS_859716]'s final status.  At a minimum, [ADDRESS_859717]'s source documentation.
Discontinuation of Study
[COMPANY_013] may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site.  The investigator may also stop the study at his/her site if he/she has safety concerns.  If [COMPANY_013] terminates the study for safety reasons, [COMPANY_013] will promptly notify the investigator.  If, in the judgment of the investigator and [COMPANY_013], the continued exposure to the study drug represents an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects, the study will be stopped.  An example of such risk would be if [ADDRESS_859718] temporarily discontinue study drug administration, which will be referred to as "treatment interruption."  The following are examples for reasons when the [COMPANY_013] TA MD must be notified in order to assess whether a subject should undergo temporary treatment interruption:

5.[ADDRESS_859720] decided to discontinue the study participation entirely (withdrawal of informed consent).  Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data even if they discontinue treatment with study drug early.
If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation (withdrawal of informed consent), the 
procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within [ADDRESS_859721] dose of study drug may be completed to ensure all treatment-emergent AEs/serious adverse events (SAEs) have been resolved.
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study drug dose and the reason for 
discontinuation of study drug or study participation.  The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator considers necessary to treat the subject's 
condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the 
investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue participation in the study.
5.7 Study Drug
Subjects will be randomly assigned to elagolix or matching placebo.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment
All subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either elagolix or placebo centrally using an interactive 
response technology (IRT).  Before the study is initiated, contact [CONTACT_642434].  Study drug will be dispensed at the study visits outlined in Appendix D , 
Activity Schedule.
As subjects enter into either the Washout Period or the Screening Period, a unique subject number will 
be assigned to each subject by [CONTACT_6606].  This unique subject number will be used for each subject throughout the study.  For subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by [CONTACT_642435].  
Once the subject's eligibility has been confirmed and prior to the Baseline (randomization) dose, a 
unique randomization number will be provided via IRT.  Stratified Randomization will be performed by a ratio of 2:2:2:2:2:3 to the following treatments:  25 mg BID, 50 mg QD, 75mg BID, 150 mg QD, 300 mg QD, or placebo (20 subjects in each active treatment group and 30 subjects in the placebo group).  Subject randomization will be stratified based on FG score (< 8, ≥ 8) and BMI (< 30, ≥30).
Study drug must not be dispensed without contact[CONTACT_112785].  Study drug may only be dispensed to subjects enrolled in the study according to kit numbers provided by [CONTACT_6606].
The randomization schedule will be computer generated by [CONTACT_66771], North 
Chicago, IL, prior to the start of the study.  A copy of all of the randomization schedules will be kept by [CONTACT_642436] a copy will be forwarded to the IRT provider.
Breaking Blind
Blind break transaction is performed in the study IRT system.  [COMPANY_013] must be notified before the blind 
is broken unless identification of the study drug is required for medical emergency, i.e., situation in which the knowledge of the specific blinded treatment will affect the immediate management of the subject's conditions (e.g., antidote is available).  [COMPANY_013] must then be notified within [ADDRESS_859728] to study subjects.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified, including those that may be due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the investigator is responsible for notifying IEC/IRB, regulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].
Page 26 of 90
STUDY M16-837  |  Version 4.[ADDRESS_859729]/device.  Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An AE can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or approved labeling, as well as from 
accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing 
condition or illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
Page 27 of 90
STUDY M16-837  |  Version 4.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (CRO) (as appropriate) as an SAE within 24 hours of the site's being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_859730] information):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26182]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_859731] signs the study-specific informed consent.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting for 
the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with global and local requirements.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following AEs of special interest will be monitored during the study:
!Elevated hepatic transaminases
!BMD decrease/fractures
!Mood and depression-related events
Of note, all pregnancy outcomes will be monitored (see below).
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe.
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities.
Severe The AE causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study drug:
Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_859732] dose of study drug of the 
Page 29 of 90
STUDY M16-837  |  Version 4.[ADDRESS_859733] be discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, information 
regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
If a subject has a positive serum pregnancy test during the Treatment Period, no additional procedures 
will be conducted; however, an ultrasound examination will be performed (and read locally) as early as possible during the first trimester of pregnancy to assess the gestational age and document an intrauterine pregnancy.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the event.
7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of this double-blind study.  The sponsor, however, will be unblinded for the entirety of the study.
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock.  The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The full analysis set (FAS) consists of all randomly assigned subjects who have received at least one dose of study drug in this study.  The data from the FAS will be presented by [CONTACT_642437], even if the subject does not receive the correct treatment or does not follow 
the protocol until completion.  The FAS will be used for all baseline and efficacy analyses.
The safety analysis set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug.  The data 
from the safety analysis set will be presented by [CONTACT_642438].  If a subject takes more than one treatment, the subject will be analyzed in the safety analysis set as taking the treatment to which she was randomized.  All safety analyses will be performed based on the safety analysis set.
7.[ADDRESS_859734] is considered a complete menstrual cycle responder if she has 
normal menstrual cycles beginning at or before Month 3 that are maintained through Month 6 during 
the Treatment Period.  The proportion of complete menstrual cycle responders will be considered an additional endpoint.

STUDY M16-837  |  Version 4.[ADDRESS_859735] (CMH) adjusted for FG score (< 8, ≥ 8) and BMI (< 30, ≥ 30) at Baseline.  
Additionally, the CMH-based 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportion of responders within each FG score (< 8, ≥ 8) and BMI (< 30, ≥  30) at Baseline will be calculated based on normal 
approximation. 
The primary analysis will be based on observed cases only; missing data will not be imputed for the 
primary endpoint.
Details on the primary and other efficacy analyses are provided in the SAP.
Sample Size Estimation
Approximately 130 subjects:  [ADDRESS_859736] 85% power to detect a difference between each elagolix group and 
the placebo group in the proportion of menstrual cycle responders, assuming response rates of 10% for the placebo group and 50% for the elagolix group with 2-sided α= 0.05.  The above sample size was 
calculated using nQuery advisor 7.0. 
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
Analysis of safety parameters will include the following:
!The number and percentage of subjects with AEs
!A summary of laboratory values
!A summary of DXA results
The full list of safety endpoints and corresponding analyses will be presented in the SAP.
8 ETHICS
8.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board 
(IEC/IRB)
The protocol, ICF(s), recruitment materials, and all subject materials will be submitted to the IEC/IRB for review and approval.  Approval of both the protocol and the ICF(s) must be obtained before any subject is enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB before the changes are implemented to the study.  In addition, all changes to the consent form(s) will be IEC/IRB approved.

and Operations Manual, and to clarify information in addition to the following:
!Remove "at time of diagnosis" in Protocol Section 5.1, eligibility criterion 7
Rationale: Physical examination or laboratory findings documenting clinical hyperandrogenism 
or biochemical hyperandrogenism can be documented during screening, not necessarily at the time of diagnosis.
!Remove "Bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral tubal occlusion, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]" in Protocol Section 5.1, eligibility criterion 19
!Rationale: Subjects are required to use 2 nonhormonal forms of contraception in this study.
Bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral tubal occlusion or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_642414]; therefore, these subjects will not be excluded from the study.

Rationale: Clarification that the blind break transaction is performed in the study IRT system.
!Add sampling windows for PK and PD samples to Section 3.6 and Section 3.7, respectively, in the Operations Manual 
Rationale: Sampling windows were added to define acceptable times of serial sample 
collections to provide sites flexibility in performing sparse PK sampling and intensive PD 
sampling.
!Add directions for protocol modifications related to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Protocol Section 2.2, Section 5.5, Section 5.7, Section 5.9, Section 8.2, Section 9,

Activities are grouped by [CONTACT_17203] (Interview, Exam, etc.).  Further information about each activity is 
provided in Section 3.
Scheduled monthly visits during the Treatment Period are based on a 28-day month.  All scheduled visits after Baseline through Week 4 should occur within ± 1 day of the projected date.  All scheduled visits after Week 4 should occur within ± 3 days of the projected date.  However, the TVU and DXA scan may be performed within approximately ± [ADDRESS_859755]'s medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding benefits for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
Optional biomarker research samples will only be collected if the subject has voluntarily signed and 
dated a written consent form describing the research.  The written consent for biomarker research may be part of the main consent form.  If the subject does not consent to providing optional samples, the subject will still be allowed to participate in the study.  A subject may withdraw consent for optional biomarker samples at any time and remain in the main study.  Data generated from the optional biomarker samples before subject withdrawal of consent will remain part of the study results.

3.2 Medical History
A complete medical history including demographics, history of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use will be taken at Washout (if applicable) or during the Screening Period for those subjects who do not requirewashout.  The medical history will be reviewed and updated at Screening.  The subject's medical history will be updated at the Baseline visit.  This updated medical history will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
3.3 Gynecological/Obstetrical and PCOS History
A detailed gynecological/obstetrical and PCOS history will be collected either during the Washout Period (if applicable) or during the Screening Period for those who do not require washout, and will include the following:
!History of PCOS, including year of diagnosis and PCOS symptoms
!History of endometriosis, ovarian cysts, endometrial polyps, or other relevant gynecological conditions
!History of gynecological surgeries and gynecological diagnostic procedures

The gynecological/obstetrical and PCOS history will be reviewed and should be updated if needed prior to dosing on Baseline (randomization) and will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment.
3.4 Adverse Event Assessment
Please refer to Section 4.2.
3.5 Patient-Reported Outcomes and Rating Scales
Prior to the start of the study, [COMPANY_013] and/or its designee will provide detailed instructions and training for study site staff administering these scales.  The objective of this training is to establish uniformity across sites in administration of these rating instruments.  The subjects and/or the investigator or site staff will complete the following questionnaires as appropriate at the time points indicated in Section 2.2and Section 2.3; the questionnaires should be administered before any other study 
procedures are performed at that visit.  Subjects and site staff will be asked to record their responses either electronically or on paper (which will then be entered into the electronic case report form [eCRF]), as applicable.
Site staff should review all subject-completed questionnaires for logic and completeness before the 
subject leaves the study site. 
Subjects will complete the self-administered patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument (when allowed 
per local regulatory guidelines).  Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with 
the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  Subjects who are functionally unable to read any of the instruments may have site personnel read the questionnaire to them.  Site personnel will encourage completion of the instrument at all specified visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items.
Page [ADDRESS_859757] visits may be conducted via phone or video conference.  The 
MBQ, PGIA/PGIH, PCOSQ, and C-SSRS may be administered by [CONTACT_642440].  
In this situation, sites will read the PRO questions and response options to the subject, record the 
subject's responses on paper (source), and transcribe into the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  The subject's ability to view the PRO to understand the questions and response options should be preserved.  Sites may share the questionnaire by [CONTACT_340261] (email or hard copy) to the subjects to allow them to read/understand the questions and responses when the subject is providing responses over the phone.  The date and time of PRO data collection should be recorded in the source along with who collected the information.
Electronic Daily Diary (e-Diary) for Uterine Bleeding
An electronic patient-reported outcomes device (e-Diary) will be provided to all subjects during Screening after informed consent is obtained.  The e-Diary contains training information for the subject, but the site staff may also provide training on the required entries in the e-Diary.  Subjects will also be instructed to complete the diary at approximately the same time every day throughout the study.
Site staff should review subject e-Diary data regularly throughout the entire study beginning at 
Screening to ensure subject completion.  Subject noncompliance should be addressed by [CONTACT_16547] a timely manner and subject retraining documented at the site.  Subjects who fail Screening will be instructed to return the e-Diary device to the site.  All subjects will be instructed to return the e-Diary device to the site at the last study visit or Premature Discontinuation visit.
Subjects will use the e-Diary to record assessments of uterine bleeding ( Appendix A ).
Menstrual Bleeding Questionnaire (MBQ)
The MBQ is a 20-item questionnaire to evaluate heavy menstrual bleeding.  The higher the score the 
heavier the menstrual bleeding burden.
The MBQ should be completed prior to any discussion of AEs or any review of laboratory findings at all 
applicable visits (Activity Schedule, Protocol Appendix D).
The subject should complete the questionnaire before site personnel perform any clinical assessments 
and before any interaction with site personnel has occurred to avoid biasing the subject's response.
Patient Global Impression for Acne and Hirsutism (PGIA and PGIH)
The Patient Global Impression of Acne (PGIA) and Patient Global Impression of Hirsutism (PGIH) will be measured using a 5-point scale and the scores will be used to assess the subject's opi[INVESTIGATOR_642416].  The PGIA and PHIH should be completed prior to 
any discussion of AEs or any review of laboratory findings at all applicable visits ( Appendix B ).
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire (PCOSQ)
This study will utilize the PCOSQ developed by [CONTACT_642441].1  The PCOSQ is a 26-item questionnaire 
broken up into 5 domains:  emotions, body hair, weight, infertility problems, and menstrual problems.  Responses are scored on a 7-point Likert scale, with low scores reflecting worse quality of life.

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The PCOSQ should be completed prior to any discussion of AEs or any review of laboratory findings at all 
applicable visits (Activity Schedule, Protocol Appendix D).
The subject should complete the questionnaire before site personnel perform any clinical assessments 
and before any interaction with site personnel has occurred to avoid biasing the subject's response.
FG Score
The FG score will be used to quantify hirsutism.[ADDRESS_859758] sensitive to androgen is assigned a score from 0 (no hair) to 4 (frankly virile), and these are summed to provide a hormonal hirsutism score.  "Focal" hirsutism (score 1 to 7) is a common normal variant, whereas generalized hirsutism (score of 8 or 
more) is abnormal in the general [LOCATION_002] population . The FG Score assessment will be performed 
by [CONTACT_093].
COVID-[ADDRESS_859759] is unable to come on-site, the FG Score can be performed at the next on-site visit.
Acne Lesion Assessment
Acne severity will be measured by:
1).  Acne lesion count:  Investigators will count the number of non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) 
and number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules) on the subject's face and sum the 
values for a total number.   
2).  Investigator's global assessment (IGA) scale.  The IGA scale is as follows:
0–Clear or normal skin (no evidence of acne)
1–Almost clear skin (some non-inflammatory acne is present with some non-inflamed papules.  
Papules may be developi[INVESTIGATOR_642417]-red in color)
2–Some non-inflammatory acne can be found with a few pustules and/or papules.  There are
no cystic acne lesions yet.3–Non-inflammatory acne dominates the area and a few inflammatory lesions can be found.  
There may or may not be one small cystic acne lesion in the area.4–Non-inflammatory and inflammatory acne lesions are more visible.  There may or may not 
be a few cystic acne lesions.5–Severe inflammatory acne dominates the area.  Several numbers of comedones, pustules, 
papules, and cystic acne are also present.
Page [ADDRESS_859760] is unable to come on-site, the Acne Lesion Assessment 
and IGA can be performed at the next on-site visit.
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
The C-SSRS3is a systematically administered instrument developed to track suicidal AEs across a 
treatment study.  The instrument is designed to assess suicidal behavior and ideation and to track and assess all suicidal events, as well as the lethality of attempts.  Additional features assessed include frequency, duration, controllability, reason for ideation, and deterrents.  Site staff will administer the 
Screening/Baseline C-SSRS questionnaire during Screening and on Baseline.  During the Treatment 
Period, site staff will administer the C-SSRS Since Last Visit questionnaire at the time points specified in Section 2.2and Section 2.3.  The C-SSRS administered at the Baseline Visit will serve as the Baseline for 
clinical assessment.
During Screening or at the Baseline visit, prior to randomization, any subject noted to have any suicide 
attempt ever or suicidal ideation with plan within the last year, either via answering "yes" to question 4 and/or question [ADDRESS_859761] (including possible discontinuation from the study and referral for appropriate psychiatric care).  
3.6 Pharmacokinetic Sampling
Sparse PK sampling (for sites that opt in to this activity):  Serial blood samples for the elagolix assay will be collected before the morning dose (0 hour) and at 1 (± 5 minutes), 2 (± 15 minutes), 4 (± 15 minutes), and 6 hours (± 15 minutes) after dosing on Study Weeks 1 and 4 (if sites choose not to participate in the optional sparse PK sampling, a single blood sample will be collected anytime upon subject's arrival at the site on Study Weeks 1 and 4).  "Intensive PK sampling" was changed in Protocol Version 3.0 to "sparse PK sampling."  The labels and references to "Intensive PK" in the study supplies and laboratory kits remain unchanged.
Single PK sample (for all sites):  In addition, a single blood sample will be collected anytime upon 
subject's arrival at the site as indicated in the Activity Schedule (Protocol Appendix D).  The samples will be assayed for elagolix concentration and exposures of elagolix will be summarized.
Plasma concentrations of elagolix will be determined by [CONTACT_642442] a 
validated method.  Refer to the Laboratory Manual for sample collection and shipment instructions.
COVID-[ADDRESS_859762] is unable to come on-site, the sparse PK sampling or single PK sample can be collected at the next on-site visit.

Intensive PD sampling:  Serial blood samples for LH and FSH assay will be collected at Baseline according 
to the following schedule:  0 hour, 0.5 (± 5 minutes), 1 (± 5 minutes), 1.5 (± 5 minutes), 2 (± 15 minutes), 2.5 (± 15 minutes), 3 (± 15 minutes), 3.5 (± 15 minutes), and 4 (± 15 minutes) hours.  On Study Weeks 1, 4, and 16, serial blood samples will be collected before the morning dose (0 hour) and at 
0.5 (± 5 minutes), 1 (± 5 minutes), 1.5 (± 5 minutes), 2 (± 15 minutes), 2.5 (± 15 minutes), 
3 (± 15 minutes), 3.5 (± 15 minutes), and 4 (± 15 minutes) hours after dosing.
In addition, a single blood sample will be collected anytime upon subject's arrival at the site on Study 
Weeks 8, 12, 20, and 24.  The samples will be assayed for LH and FSH concentrations, and exposures of both hormones will be summarized.
Serum concentrations of LH, FSH, and other relevant hormones and laboratory tests will be determined 
by [CONTACT_26282] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]).  Refer to the Laboratory Manual for sample collection and shipment instructions.
COVID-[ADDRESS_859763] is unable to come on-site, the intensive PD sampling or single PD sample can be collected at the next on-site visit.
3.8 Biomarker Research Sampling
Optional biomarker samples for DNA and RNA isolation from whole blood, serum, and plasma will be collected from consenting subjects at the time points specified in Section 2.  All biomarker samples 
should be collected, labeled, and shipped as outlined in the study-specific lab manual.
[COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) will store the optional biomarker samples and 
data in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples may be retained while research on elagolix (or drugs of this class) or PCOS and related conditions continues, but for no longer than [ADDRESS_859764] is unable to come on-site, the optional biomarker samples can be collected at the next on-site visit.
3.9 Contraception Counseling/Dispense Contraceptives 
The sponsor will train investigators and study staff on the importance of contraception in this clinical 
trial.  The investigator or designated study staff will counsel subjects at every visit as noted in the 
Activity Schedule (Protocol Appendix D) throughout study participation on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the use of appropriate and effective methods of contraception.  
Subjects must agree to use 2 forms of nonhormonal contraception (dual contraception) as indicated in 
the protocol.

(via signature) her full awareness that the potential risks of study drug on the unborn child are 
unknown, and therefore, she must not get pregnant during the entire time of study participation, and that she agrees to consistently use protocol-required nonhormonal contraception throughout her study participation.
2. The investigator or designated study staff will counsel the subject that the study drug is not a 
contraceptive, that ovulation may occur even though the study drug may have altered menstrual cycle patterns, and that fetal abnormalities have been reported in women who have received elagolix in clinical studies; however, it is unknown whether these abnormalities were the result of taking elagolix.
3. The sponsor will provide training materials to the sites for instructing subjects on the types of 
protocol-allowed contraception methods, their effectiveness, and proper use.
(1) The sponsor will provide all investigative sites with a supply of materials to promote 
pregnancy prevention, including contraceptives (e.g., condoms and spermicides) to 
provide to subjects at no charge.  
(2) Subjects should only use the pregnancy prevention materials provided by [CONTACT_456].
(3) Subjects will be allowed to choose an acceptable contraception method of their choice 
from the contraceptives provided by [CONTACT_642443].  The site will assess the subject's basic understanding of the proper contraceptive use through discussion and demonstration of proper techniques, if needed, including proper diaphragm use.
(4) The site will provide contraceptives and other supplies (e.g., lubricants) to subjects at the 
time points specified in Section 2, as necessary.  
(5) The source documents will capture the date that initial contraception counseling was 
performed, whether the subject meets protocol criteria for not requiring use of dual contraception, and the type of contraceptive provided to the subject (as applicable).  At subsequent study visits, the source documents will capture any change in contraceptive method, use of a non-study supply brand, and whether additional contraceptives were provided to the subject.
(6) The subject will be asked to attest by [CONTACT_112756], and subsequently 
in a stand-alone attestation form at study visits specified in the Activity Schedule (Protocol Appendix D) that allowable methods of contraception, as described during the pregnancy prevention counseling, are being practiced.
4. Monthly study contacts are used to promote frequent interaction with site staff and 
opportunities for continued education.
5. At each Treatment Period visit (on-site), the proper use of contraception will be reinforced to 
address possible ineffective use and the risk of unexpected pregnancy due to unprotected sexual activity.
Page [ADDRESS_859766] is unable to come on-site, the contraception counseling 
should be conducted during the phone visits (as applicable). The site should ship a reasonable quantity 
of contraceptive supplies for subject use until next on-site visit.  The type and quantity of contraceptives 
shipped to the subject must be documented along with the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_642418]. When the subject is able to go to the site, site should make sure that enough contraceptives are dispensed to the subject.
3.10 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting 12-lead ECG will be obtained during the Screening Period to confirm subject eligibility for the study unless the subject had one performed within 6 months of Screening and has documentation of the 
requirements.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_642419], 
determine whether any findings outside the normal physiological variation are clinically significant (in consultation with a cardiologist if necessary), and document this on the ECG report.  The original ECG tracing with the physician's assessment will be retained in the subject's records at the study site.

medical history, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
At any time, a symptom-directed physical examination can be performed as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1275].
COVID-[ADDRESS_859768] is unable to come on-site, physical examination can be performed at the next on-site visit.
3.14 Gynecological (Pelvic and Breast) Examination
A complete breast and pelvic examination will be performed at the time points specified in Section 2.  
The complete breast and pelvic examination completed during Screening will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment.
COVID-[ADDRESS_859769] is unable to come on-site, the gynecological examinations can be performed at the next on-site visit.
3.15 Papanicolaou (Pap) Test
A Pap test will be performed in subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_859770] 
Eligibility.  For those subjects who require a pap smear during the Screening visit, the pap will be 
performed using the Thin Prep® Pap Test™ provided and analyzed by [CONTACT_2237].  If the 
subject is experiencing uterine bleeding that precludes the performance of the Pap test, this procedure should be performed as soon as possible after the uterine bleeding has ended.  In the case of an unsatisfactory sample, the Pap test can be repeated.  The repeat Pap test should also be performed when the subject is not experiencing uterine bleeding.  In order to be enrolled in the study, the Pap test must meet eligibility requirements as outlined in Figure [ADDRESS_859771] Eligibility. 
Subjects who are 25 to 35 years of age, with the Pap diagnosis of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_145582] (ASC-US), or low-grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716] (LSIL) and those > 30 years of age with negative intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_251147] (NILM) but absent or insufficient endocervical/transformational zone (EC/TZ) component will have reflex human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) testing as outlined in Figure 1 .  Those with high-risk HPV, NILM with absent or insufficient EC/TZ, or LSIL 
with or without high-risk HPV will be screen failed and may undergo additional evaluation/colposcopy outside of the protocol per local guidelines or standard of care. 
If a subject has colposcopy performed outside of the study, they may be rescreened if they have no 
other exclusionary criteria and had an adequate colposcopy with a negative endocervical sample post colposcopy.  If biopsies are performed, they must show a histological diagnosis of cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_642420] 73 of 90

Sites can either use the endometrial biopsy instruments provided by [CONTACT_642444].
Premedication for the endometrial biopsy procedure is allowable and should be recorded in source 
documents and on the appropriate eCRF.  At the investigator's discretion, misoprostol for cervical 
dilatation is allowable.  In addition, lidocaine may be used as local anesthesia on the cervix.  Any 
medications used for the procedure should be recorded in source documents and on the appropriate eCRF.  If there is a need for consideration for an office hysteroscopy to obtain the endometrial biopsy sample, the [COMPANY_013] TA MD (Section 1) should be consulted.  
If the endometrial biopsy is performed on the same day as the Pap smear or pelvic ultrasound, the endometrial biopsy should be performed after the Pap smear and pelvic ultrasound.
The investigator must obtain and review biopsy results from the central laboratory to ensure that 
eligibility criteria are met before the subject can be randomized on Baseline Visit.  In case of an insufficient sample, the biopsy may be repeated; however, results must be available prior to Baseline.  Subjects must have an adequate endometrial biopsy, (i.e., results show no endometrial pathology) to be eligible for randomization.
If an abnormal finding such as endometritis, hyperplasia (with or without atypia), or endometrial cancer 
is reported, subjects will not be eligible for randomization into the study.  If the investigator determines that an abnormal finding can be treated outside of the protocol, the subject will be considered a screen failure, but may be rescreened per rescreening guidelines in the protocol.
3.17 Central/Local Imaging Procedures
Pelvic Ultrasound:  TAU and TVU
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed by [CONTACT_3878]'s or affiliated radiology 
department at the time points specified in Section 2 .  Images will be sent/transmitted to the central 
reader to determine subject eligibility for entry into the study and for subject evaluation during the 
course of the study.
Assessments for the pelvic ultrasound include, but are not limited to the following:
!Endometrial thickness
!Presence of abnormal endometrial appearance or endometrial pathology
!Presence of uterine fibroids
!Presence of ovarian cysts (to include number, size [cm], location [right or left ovary], simple 
versus complex)
!Solid ovarian lesions > 1.[ADDRESS_859774] diameter
!Persistent simple ovarian cyst > [ADDRESS_859775] diameter
!Complex ovarian cyst > 3.[ADDRESS_859776] point
!An endometrioma > 3.5 cm in diameter (longest diameter)

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].A local reading will be performed to rule out pelvic masses or other significant pathologies.  The 
investigator should consult the local ultrasound report (or images if the report is not available) in order to make any safety-related judgments concerning the subject.  In this case, the local ultrasound reports will be maintained in the subject's source documents and copi[INVESTIGATOR_642425].  Data from the local ultrasound report will not be reported in the eCRF unless associated with an adverse event.
Ovarian Findings
During Screening, if the initial pelvic ultrasound shows a simple ovarian cyst > 5 cm and ≤[ADDRESS_859777] be evaluated prior to Baseline Visit (randomization) and not meet exclusion criteria (i.e., persistent simple ovarian cyst > 5 cm).  If the investigator notes endometrial thickness ≥ 5 mm, they 
may proceed to perform an endometrial biopsy based on the local read; however, the reading provided by [CONTACT_642445].
In Screening, if any of the adnexal structures, such as an ovary, cannot be visualized on the pelvic 
ultrasound due to, for example, fibroid location and/or fibroid size, the subject may be eligible for randomization provided there are no exclusionary findings based on an alternate imaging that can evaluate that adnexa, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (per central reader request).  The central 
reader may also request a magnetic resonance imaging scan at the Week 24/premature discontinuation 
visit, if needed.  During the Screening Period, if the subject requires an MRI and the subsequent pelvic ultrasound is not readable, the subject will not continue to have pelvic ultrasounds.  An MRI will be completed at the final visit.
During the Treatment Periods, if the pelvic ultrasound shows a simple ovarian cyst > [ADDRESS_859778] (including endometriomas) > 3.[ADDRESS_859779] diameter, the findings should be documented as an AE if the investigator considers them to be clinically significant.
Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)
DXA scans of the lumber spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], femoral neck, and total hip will be performed at the time points specified in Section 2.  Site training and qualifications, which include assessment of instruments, will be 
evaluated/approved by [CONTACT_642446]. Instructions on calibration and standardization of instruments and any additional required information will be specified in a manual from the central reader that will be provided to all study sites. Sites will need to obtain approval from the central reader prior to initiating study scans.
The screening DXA scan will be sent to the central reader to determine eligibility and serve as the 
baseline scan for subject management.
During the Treatment Periods, DXA scans will be performed for all subjects at Week [ADDRESS_859780]/radiologists at the site or affiliated imaging facility 
using GE Lunar or Hologic equipment and per the acquisition guidelines provided by [CONTACT_530426] (central reader).  The DXA technologist/radiologist or designee for each investigative site 
Page [ADDRESS_859781]'s DXA images to the central reader for review and analysis 
following acquisition. The central reader will be blinded to the subject's treatment assignment, but not to the corresponding time point.
Subject eligibility will be made based on the central reader review. Sites will receive reports from the 
central reader that detail the results (including Z-scores and bone mineral density (BMD) % change from Baseline, as applicable) of the DXA scans performed.
COVID-[ADDRESS_859782] is unable to come on-site or to the imaging facility, the DXA and TAU/TVU can be delayed up to [ADDRESS_859783]-to-patient (DTP) and direct-from -patient (DFP) transfer because of the COVID-[ADDRESS_859784].  
[COMPANY_013] will submit any required notifications to the regulatory authority as applicable. 
!Sites will be responsible for meeting IRB reporting requirements and submitting the booking form to the local IRB (as applicable).
The investigator must discuss the DTP process with the subject:
!Obtain consent to provide delivery information to local courier and document this in the source.
!Obtain results of required safety procedures (e.g., urine pregnancy testing) before registering subject dispensation of study drug in IRT.
!Confirm that the subject will be available to accept delivery.
!The site will follow up with the subject after shipment is received.
!The subject should maintain the drug containers, as well as any unused drug for return to site.

COVID-[ADDRESS_859787] laboratory work done at a local lab, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or other facility.  Local lab results should be 
obtained along with reference ranges and kept within the subjects' source documentation.  Local lab results should be reviewed by [CONTACT_82674].
If laboratory samples cannot be collected, the site will need to reach out to the medical monitor to 
determine further action and if study drug should be discontinued.
Laboratory samples indicated in Table 1 will be sent to the certified central lab selected for this study.  
All laboratory samples listed above will be assessed using a certified laboratory selected for this study
and these data will be used for data analysis.  The central laboratory will provide instructions regarding 
the collection (including any fasting requirements), processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_26172].  Blood draws 
should be performed after vital signs are conducted at a visit.
Clinical chemistry samples, insulin, and lipid panel should be obtained in the morning following an 
overnight fast (minimum of 8 hours); however, there may be circumstances when the sample is 
obtained later in the day and/or not under fasting conditions.  If the sample was obtained with less than [ADDRESS_859788] to verify the out-of-range value.  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities after randomization may be documented as AEs, depending on the investigator's interpretation.
All screening laboratory results must be reviewed prior to Baseline, including any repeated test results.  
Screening laboratory tests may be repeated one time prior to the Baseline Visit; however, results must satisfy entry criteria prior to randomization.  Subjects should not be randomized at Baseline Visit if screening laboratory results do not meet entry criteria or the investigator assesses them as clinically significant.  The most recent laboratory test results obtained prior to the Baseline Visit predose samples will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment.
The investigator will receive sponsor-defined alerts from the central laboratory.  The investigator will 
review the lab alerts and assess clinical significance for potential AEs.
Serology Testing for Hepatitis
The central laboratory will test all subjects for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) during the Screening Period.  HCV RNA testing will be performed for those subjects with a positive HCV Ab.  A positive HBsAg or detectable HCV RNA will exclude subject from participation.  Borderline hepatitis test results should be repeated.
Lipid Panel
The lipid panel consists of LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, and total cholesterol; and should be obtained in the morning following an overnight fast (minimum of 8 hours); however, there may be circumstances when the sample is obtained later in the day and/or not under fasting conditions.

marked to indicate that the sample was obtained under nonfasting conditions.
Pregnancy Tests (Serum and Urine)
Urine and/or serum pregnancy tests will be performed at the time points specified in Section 2, in all 
subjects regardless of sexual activity status or method of contraception, including subjects who are surgically sterilized.
The urine pregnancy test result on Baseline must be reviewed and confirmed to be negative prior to 
randomization.
A positive urine pregnancy test result must be confirmed with a quantitative serum pregnancy test.  
Study drug must not be dispensed if the subject has a positive urine pregnancy test result at any visit during the Treatment Periods (including Baseline result).  The site will immediately inform the subject to discontinue study drug temporarily while the subject waits for the results of the serum pregnancy test.  If a serum pregnancy test result is positive, the site should instruct the subject to complete a Premature Discontinuation visit within [ADDRESS_859789] result, a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) must be 
conducted as early as possible in the first trimester in order to assess the gestational age and estimated 
due date.

Study Title  Multi -level Intervention to Reduce Pregn ancy Risk Among 
Adolescents:  A Feasibility Trial in the Emergency 
Department  
Study Design  Randomized Clinical Trial  
This project will involve human subjects in a clinical trial 
conducted at Children’s Mercy (CM) and the Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP). We will train advanced 
practice practitioners to deliver the contraception 
intervention to adolescents and b oth practitioners and 
adolescents will complete surveys after the intervention. 
After recruitment for the intervention is completed, we will 
conduct interviews with key stakeholders at each institution. 
CM will be the primary site and CHOP will ultimately seek 
reliance on our IRB.  
Primary Objective  Conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate intervention 
feasibility constructs: acceptability, demand, 
implementation, practicality, adaptation, integration, 
expansion, and limited -efficacy.

Agent(s)  We will evaluate our novel approach to increase access to 
contraception comparing our multi -level intervention (MLI) 
to enhanced standard of care (eSOC). All adolescents receive 
the MI -enhanc ed counseling and clinic referral. Those 
randomized to MLI will be offered immediate, ED -based 
contraception (i.e., oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], transdermal patch, vaginal ring, 
injection, subdermal implant) in addition to receive a warm 
referral  (provider helpi[INVESTIGATOR_662276] -up 
appointment)  to follow -up on selected method (or to initiate 
in clinic, if preferred). Per usual care, eSOC participants may 
obtain contraception only at the referral.

SHORT TITLE: Reducing Pregnancy in the ED  
 Page 7 of 36 Version 3 dated 07.02.21 2.0 Objectives  
Evaluate intervention feasibility constructs: acceptability, demand implementation, 
practicality, adaptation, integration, expansion, and limited -efficacy.  We will 
conduct a small  randomized trial to assess feasibility and use mixed -methodology to 
explore contextual factors at the patient, provider, and system levels. In evaluating 
limited -efficacy, we compare two arms (MLI vs. eSOC) to determine size of effect rates 
on contracepti on initiation.  
Hypothesis 1.1:  The intervention will be deemed feasible by [CONTACT_104977]: adolescents 
and organizational personnel (i.e., study provider s, adolescent medicine specialists,  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662278]).  
Hypothesis 1.2:  Adolesc ents in the MLI arm will have greater contraception initiation 
rates relative to the eSOC arm at [ADDRESS_893706] an estimated $9.[ADDRESS_893707] use.5 Many, 
especially minority and uninsured youth, do not attend health maintenance visits;6 among 
those who do , 36 seconds is spent discussing sexuality and contraceptive use is not 
routinely assessed.6 Multi -level interventions to increase access  to contraceptive 
counseling and all contraceptive types are desperately needed .7 
As adolescent access to affordable, confidential contraceptive care has worsened in recent 
years, one approach to increase access is to utilize non -traditional settings, such  as 
Emergency Departments (EDs).7 The Society for Academic Medicine recognizes the ED 
as an “effective site for preventive care,” evidenced by [CONTACT_662287], 
consensus statements, and specialized training opportunities to reduce disparities 
stemming from social determinants of health.8-11 Adolescents make 19 million ED visits 
annually, commonly for non -urgent or reproductive complaints; for many, this may be 
their only contact [CONTACT_4490] a provider.12-14 Adolescents in the ED frequently report 
unprot ected intercourse.25,40 The pregnancy risk index (PRI), an estimate of pregnancy 
risk in the subsequent [ADDRESS_893708] focused on screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
including HIV19-[ADDRESS_893709] focused on emergency contraception or increasing clinic referral, with 
mixed results.27,28-31 A small open trial provided counseling and clinic referral for those 
wanting to initiate contraception. Only 22% completed the referral and one was found to 
be pregnant at her first clinic visit.[ADDRESS_893710] common reason 
for not  completing referral. Because interventions to address multi -level barriers and 
SHORT TITLE: Reducing Pregnancy in the ED  
 Page 8 of 36 Version 3 dated 07.02.21 increase contraception access  are sorely needed, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of a 
novel ED -based intervention, utilizing a mixed methods approach.  
Scientific Premise:  Many adolescents in the ED are at high -risk of pregnancy yet 
accepting of reproductive intervention; however, no work describes best practices for 
ED-based contraceptive provision. Thus, we propose a randomized trial  to evaluate MLI, 
which includes ED -based contraceptive initiation (i.e., oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], transdermal patch, 
vaginal ring, injection, or subdermal implant) vs. eSOC, for adolescents in two EDs 
utilizing medical p rovider s in a collaborative care model. Thus, we use a rigorous 
framework from Bowen et al.  to evaluate feasibility constructs (see Table [ADDRESS_893711] 
definitions) among adolescents and organizational personnel (i.e., medical  provider s, 
adolescent medicine specialists, ED nursing and administrative leaders) in two unique 
EDs.33 
 
4.0 Study Endpoin ts 
 
The primary endpoint will be the determination of feasibility. Methods for establishing 
feasibility vary  and include  levels of acceptability, satisfaction, or usefulness. Drawing on 
similar published criteria,  the intervention will be  deemed feasible i f the average score 
across all items  is ≥ 3 on closed -ended survey items for adolescents, provider s, and O OPs 
(Table 1).    
 
Secondary endpoints will include the following:   
• The completion of a referral for any contraceptive care as assessed through EMR 
review or follow -up phone calls .  
• The initiation of contraception as assessed through EMR review or follow -up 
phone calls .   
• Saturation of themes  from qualitative interviews that have been coded and 
analyzed .   
 
Hypotheses 1.1 and 1.2 : To establish feasibi lity, we assess multiple constructs via 
survey items among all stakeholders (Table 1).  
Hypotheses 1.2 : We will determine referral completion and date for contraception 
initiation (Time 0) via participant contact [CONTACT_662288]/medical records  at 
thirty days after the index visit .

5.0 Study Intervention/Inves tigational Agent  
5.1 The study intervention is the implementation of Emergency 
Department -based contraceptive counseling. A provider will 
provide this confidential, comprehensive, 10 -15-minute counseling. 
The counseling will assess patients’ preferences regard ing different 
methods, knowledge about methods, personal motivations, and 
environmental factors that may influence contraceptive use, such as 
partner preference.  After counseling is complete, enrolled subjects 
that have been randomized into the MLI group will have the 
opportunity to accept birth control and a referral for follow -up care.   
  
For Emergency Contraception  
Plan B (also called levonorgestrel) is taken by [CONTACT_662289] a woman to prevent 
pregnancy after she has already had unprotected sex. It is available over -the-
counter for any person to buy. Plan B has no serious or lasting side -effects and 
leaves the body withi n a few days. Some women (fewer than one in five) have 
mild and short -term side -effects, including irregular bleeding from the vagina, 
belly pain, being tired, nausea (feeling like you might throw up).  
SHORT TITLE: Reducing Pregnancy in the ED  
 Page [ADDRESS_893712] including those with estrogen 
and progesterone combined (e.g., Sprintec, Ortho -Evra , Yaz ).  The most common 
side effects from combination hormonal contraception are mild and include: 
irregular vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, n ausea, and mood changes. Serious 
adverse events may occur. Older women who smoke are at increased risk of 
myocardial infarction or stroke. There is no increased risk of myocardial 
infarction or stroke among healthy nonsmoking women who use the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. Blood 
clots in the legs and elsewhere are slightly more frequent with contraceptive use, 
but the risk is very low, and lower than the increased risk of clotting that occurs 
with pregnancy. There is no increased risk of birth defects in babies born to 
women who h ave taken hormonal contraception while pregnant, but a woman 
should not use hormonal contraception if she is pregnant.  
Medroxyprogesterone acetate: The most common side effects from DMPA are 
mild and include: irregular menstrual cycles, cessation of menstr ual periods, 
headache, and weight gain. Serious adverse events may occur. Use of DMPA may 
cause loss of bone mineral density, which may lead to an increased risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_403182]. The decrease in bone calcium is most concerning if the 
patient has  bone disease, family history of osteoporosis, or anorexia nervosa. 
Older women who smoke are at increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke. 
There is no increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke among healthy 
nonsmoking women who use the pil l. Blood clots in the legs and elsewhere are 
slightly more frequent with contraceptives, but the risk is very low, and lower 
than the increased risk of clotting that occurs with pregnancy. There is no 
increased risk of birth defects in babies born to women  who have taken hormonal 
contraception while pregnant, but a woman should not use hormonal 
contraception if she is pregnant.  
Ortho Evra and Xulane (Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol) is birth control patch 
that works by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_662279]. It may also chang e cervical mucus to prevent 
the sperm from reaching the egg and change the lining of the uterus to prevent a 
fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. Side effects can include: breast 
tenderness or enlargement; headache; menstrual cramps; mild fluid re tention or 
weight gain; mild skin irritation at the application site; nausea; stomach pain, 
cramps, or bloating; vaginal spotting or breakthrough bleeding; vomiting.  
NuvaRing (ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel) is a birth control vaginal ring that 
contain s female hormones that stop ovulation (the release of an egg from an 
ovary). This medicine also causes changes in the cervical mucus and uterine 
lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized 
egg to attach to the uterus.  Side effects may include: headache; vaginal irritation 
or discharge, cervical pain; menstrual cramps; mood changes, decreased sex 
drive; nausea, vomiting, stomach pain; breast pain or tenderness; acne; or weight 
gain.  
SHORT TITLE: Reducing Pregnancy in the ED  
 Page [ADDRESS_893713] common side effects from subdermal implants include changes in 
menstrual bleeding patterns; headaches; vaginitis; weight gain; acne; breast pain; 
viral infection such as sore throats or flu -like symptoms; stomach pain; painful 
periods; mood swings , nervousness, or depressed mood; back pain; nausea; 
dizziness; pain and pain at the site of insertion .  
For Non -Hormonal Contraception  
Common side effects for non -hormonal contraception (Copper IUD, Phexxi) 
include irritation, dryness and/or allergic reac tions.   
 
Risk of emotional distress: Participants may experience increased stress over the 
sensitive survey questions. However, we feel this risk is minimal and we have 
included information in the consent process that reminds participants that they are 
not required to answer questions that make them feel uncomfortable. In the 
emergency department, there are always advocates available for patients and 
families, if needed, including health care providers, social workers, and patient 
advocates. In this study setting, if a participant expresses a concern or need that is 
outside of the scope of this project (e.g., sexual assault), we will refer those 
participants back to their ED treating team, as is our standard practice. During the 
consent process, we will inf orm participants that most of the information they 
share during the study will be kept confidential except in rare cases where their 
safety is at risk or mandated reporting is in effect  
5.[ADDRESS_893714] amount of estrogen and progesterone that is 
compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual 
patient. We will screen participants for predisposing conditions 
and duration of previous DMPA use. Women with these conditions 
should not use hormonal contraceptives: women with stroke or 
blood clot, circulation problems (especially if caused by [CONTACT_37110]), 
a hormo ne-related cancer such as breast or uterine cancer, 
abnormal vaginal bleeding, liver disease or liver cancer, severe 
high blood pressure, migraine headaches, or a heart valve disorder. 
Further, DMPA should not be used as a long -term method (i.e., 
longer th an 2 years) unless other methods are considered 
inadequate.

6.0 Procedures Involved  
 
We propose a ran domized trial of our contraceptive counseling intervention (MLI 
vs. eSOC) with mixed methods feasibility evaluation at patient, provider, and 
system levels. Feasibility constructs are: acceptability, demand, implementation, 
practicality, adaptation, integr ation, expansion, and limited -efficacy.  
Using an electronic board that tracks patient data in real time, the research study 
staff will identify and enroll adolescent participants  (N=98)  before they meet with 
a provider . Due to possible COVID precautions, research staff will have the 
capability of recruiting patients remotely.  Consenting and the study visit will take 
place on the same day of enrollment  during the patients ED visit .  If necessary, a 
member of the research team may call into the patient room via Microsoft Teams 
or CMH office phones to contact [CONTACT_662290].  Follow up surveys 
at thirty -days, three months, and six months are administered via REDCap and 
may be sent through Twilio or e -mail.  Mem bers of the research team may also 
call participants up to five times to administer the surveys verbally using either 
Microsoft Teams or CMH phones.   
We will use a care model demonstrated as best practice in clinic -based settings36 
and train provider s using adapted materials publicly available (e.g., slide decks, 
written materials).37-40 Adaptations are needed for vulnerable adolescent 
populations that are mindful of coercion and will include use of brief Motivational 
Interviewing (MI) strateg ies to facilitate autonomy and focus on patient 
preference. MI training for providers will focus on these skills: open questions, 
reflective listening, and pulling for change talk.41-45 Provider s will receive nine 
hours of training (e.g., prescribing, adol escent -centered counseling, technology) 
and demonstrate competency (mean fidelity score ≥3, appendix  1) prior to 
continued recruitment.  
As adolescents mature along different trajectories, we plan open -ended questions 
to ask about intention, experiences (se lf/referents), and contraceptive qualities. 
Given that many in our ED reported relationship abuse, we will use a trauma -
informed approach (i.e., realize, recognize, respond, resist re -traumatization) to 
foster collaboration, explore safety, and offer harm reduction strategies.48-49 We 
will help  participants 1) map information onto values and lifestyle, and 2) 
anticipate and  solve problems, including identification of a trusted adult. We will 
address risk  misperceptions  use visual aids, and counsel dual pro tection with 
condoms. Based  on our work and others, providers  will provide  10-15 minutes for 
counseling; this is easily integrated into most ED visits .  Counseling sessions will 
occur after patients have  completed triaging, without interrupting  the evaluation 
of standard of care services.   
Providers  will also have access to educational material, which can be distributed 
to adolescents randomized in MLI arm.  These documents include the following:  
FDA Approved factsheets (Ring, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], Patch, Mini Pi [INVESTIGATOR_4382], Progestin IUD, Implant, 
Non-Hormonal Gel, Emergency Contraception, and Depo), Switching Birth 
SHORT TITLE: Reducing Pregnancy in the ED  
 Page 13 of 36 Version 3 dated 07.02.21 Control, IUD Facts, Implant Facts, Contraception Choices, and CMH Clinic 
Hours and Locations.  The contraception handouts that are being provided will 
help to  provide further clarifications regarding medication effectiveness, 
adherence instructions, as well as medication side effects.   
C6eii. Adolescent Randomization and Treatment:  Randomization will be in a 1:[ADDRESS_893716] for both Children’s Mercy and Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] , placing each assignment in a sealed envelope numbered 
sequentially from 001.54 Participant IDs will be assigned beginning with 001. 
After consent, a research assistant will open the corresponding envelope to carry 
out the arm assignment, notifying the providers before  counseling is completed.  
All participants receive contraceptive counseling. Per evidence -based 
guidelines,52-53 MLI participants  can receive contraception (one injection, three -
month  supply of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]/patch/ring, or subdermal implant) in the ED , or prescription 
for another method if desired . If a patient in this group desires another method 
that is not being covered by [CONTACT_1758], patient will be made aware of their 
responsibility to cove r the cost of the medication either out of pocket, or by [CONTACT_662291].  Due to credentialing and staffing constraints, intrauterine 
devices will only be available at referral clinics.   MLI participants who want to 
initiate contraception must complete a urine pregnancy test , which must be 
negative. MLI participants who initiate contraception will be given a take home 
pregnancy test that is to be completed two weeks after enrollment.   eSOC 
participants  will have the opportunity of being  referr ed to a follow -up 
appointment to discuss  and begin  contraception.   Subjects in this group will not 
begin contraception in the Emergency Department  or given a prescription .  All 
participants will be referred to an adolescent gynecologist, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -affiliated 
adolescent clinic, or Title X clinic for additional care and to initiate or follow -up 
on contraception.  
MLI participants  will have a “warm transfer” to follow -up on or initiate, if 
preferred, selected method. Warm transfers occur with the assistance of a  provider 
scheduling the follow -up appointment.  Doing this in such a way  should help to 
minimize barriers with navigating the healthcare system.  The provider  will share 
detailed clinic information including hours of operation  and contact [CONTACT_662292]. We will assist with scheduling (sending multiple reminders) and 
transportation . eSOC participants  will be given printed information on clinics.  
C6eiii. Inte rvention Fidelity:  Counseling sessions  will be audio -recorded and 
reviewed periodically  to ensure for fidelity to content and use of MI strategies 
using a tool adapted from our previous work and the CHOICE Project, a clinic -
based intervention efficacious f or increasing contraception uptake in family -
planning clinics .54-55 We will provide feedback to individual AP Ps if mean fidelity 
score ≤ 3.   
6.1  
SHORT TITLE: Reducing Pregnancy in the ED  
 Page [ADDRESS_893717].  The research team will approach patients to ensure that 
they meet qualifications  for the study.  If qualifications are meet, the 
research team will provide consent/assent to the patient , conduct a pre -
counseling survey, then notify a study provider  of study status.  Once the 
subject has been enrolled, the study provider  will provide contraception 
counseling , while incorporating motivational interviewing techniques. 
Counseling sessions will be audio recorded and analyzed periodically for 
fideli ty. At the completion of counseling, the study provider  will offer the 
participant various contraception options and incorporate warm -referral 
practices to encourage follow -up at a local health clinic.  The subject and 
provider will complete the Adolescent  Post-Counseling Survey  via 
REDCap  at the end of their initial enrollment .  
Immediately after the initial enrollment  and at thirty -days post 
intervention , the research team staff will conduct a medical chart review .  
At thirty days, three months and six months post -intervention,  a follow -up

14.0 Screening and Recruitment Methods  
 
Adolescen t subjects will be recruited from the Emergency Departments of 
Children’s Mer cy Adele Hall and Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662281].  Research staff will evaluate for potential patients via 
electronic tracking boards.  Recruitment for adolescent  subjects will take place  
while patients are within the Emergency Department .  Once a subject is deemed 
potential eligible, research staff will approach a patient to ensure eligibility, 
provide inf ormed consent, and continue with study procedures. Patients will be 
approached after they have become admitted in the Emergency Department 
from triage.  Parents and patients will be told basic information regarding 
research at Children’s Mercy, and parents  will be asked to step out of the room

16.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
SHORT TITLE: Reducing Pregnancy in the ED  
 Page 21 of 36 Version 3 dated 07.02.21 All subjects may withdraw from the research study at any time .  If they would like 
to withdraw, they are asked to notify any member of the research team 
immediately.   
If an adolescent, study provider , or OOP  withdraws from the study, an y data 
collected will be kept and dei dentified for analysis purposes.   
17.0 Risks to Subjects  
 
Providers /OOP : Risks to study providers /OOPs  will likely be minimal as they are 
receiving contraceptiv e training and completing brief surveys to share their perceptions. 
There is minimal risk of loss of confidentiality which will be explained during consent.  
 
Adolescents: Using the various birth control methods can cause minimal side 
effects that are listed in Section [ADDRESS_893727]  practice guidelines for administering 
and prescribing medication s. 
Risks to participants are anticipated to be minimal . ED patients with severe illness 
or who experienced sexual assault will be excluded from this study to minimize 
the physical and emotional harm to study participants. Counseling sessions will be 
administered by [CONTACT_662295] s in a confidential setting to avoid emotional 
discomfort to participants when discussing sensitive matters. There is minor risk 
of variance of counseling content, but this will be avoided by [CONTACT_662296] s by [CONTACT_662297] e xpert at 
each site. Counseling sessions will be continuously reviewed for quality. 
Additionally, there is minor risk of unauthorized disclosure of confidential 
information, which will be made known to participants and will be minimized by 
[CONTACT_5051] ’s efforts to ensure confidentiality. Every effort will be made to 
keep data coded. All recruitment materials (e.g., signed consent forms) and 
information linking unique identification numbers to participant names will be 
stored in password -protected elect ronic files within REDCap. Only [CONTACT_10017]  and 
designated study staff will have access to these files. Risks are greatly reduced by 
[CONTACT_171739], storing data on secure computers, and coding of data. Patients 
may choose not to participate.  
As with an y study involving collection of data, there is a possibility of breach of 
confidentiality of data.  There is also a risk to confidentiality when using the 
internet or a mobile network.  Corresponding through email and text messaging is 
not a secure method of sending information and others may be able to access the 
information sent.  Every precaution will be taken to secure participants’ personal 
information .   
18.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
 
Study providers may benefit from additional training in contraception counseling.  
Adolescent participants may benefit from learning about birth control methods 
and ways to reduce their risk of unintended pregnancy.  
SHORT TITLE: Reducing Pregnancy in the ED  
 Page 22 of 36 Version 3 dated 07.02.21 Findings of this study could contribute to a reduction in unintended pregnancies 
among adolescen ts. The data obtained through this study may be used to inform 
new guidelines for adolescent -centered contraceptive services, which could offer 
benefit s for adolescents in the future . The minimal risks of participation are 
reasonable in relation to these g eneralizable benefits.  
19.0 Investigator Assessment of Risk /Benefits  Ratio : (IRB makes the 
final determination)  Based upon your response in Sections 17.[ADDRESS_893728] as applicable:  Pediatric Risk Category:  
x Category 1  Research not involving greater than minimal risk  
(45 CFR §46.404 and 21 CFR §50.51)    
Select if applicable:  Adult Risk Category:  
☒ Not Greater than Minimal Risk  
☐ Greater than Minimal Risk  
 
As there is no more than minimal risk to study participation, and potential for minimal 
direct benefits and significant indirect benefits, we feel that the benefit outweighs the risk 
of participation.  
 
20.[ADDRESS_893729] information for the study team will be included on consent forms t o allow 
participants to ask questions or raise concerns about the study. Should any specific 
concerns arise, the study team would intervene to address problems including, if needed, 
a change or discontinuation of study procedures. The mentor team and site IRB’s will be 
informed of any concerns, and the IRB and NIH will be informed of any adverse events.  
 
Secure Storage of Data  
Records to be kept and Secure Storage of Data:  Survey development, data collection and 
handling will be conducted through Children’ s Mercy’s REDCap Research software.  
The Redcap database is protected by [CONTACT_662298]'s zNcrypt product . zNcrypt transparently 
encrypts and secures data at rest without any changes to your applications or database and 
ensures there is minimal performance lag in  the encryption or decryption process. 
Advanced key management and process -based access controls enable organizations to 
meet compliance regulations and ensure unauthorized parties or malicious actors never 
SHORT TITLE: Reducing Pregnancy in the ED  
 Page 23 of 36 Version 3 dated 07.02.21 gain access to the encrypted data. zNcrypt meets compliance for HIPAA, PCI -DSS, 
FISMA, EU Data Protection, and more.  
Data will be exported from REDCap to statistical programs for analysis (i.e. SAS, SPSS, 
Excel.) All data will be securely stored on password -protected servers.  
 
20.[ADDRESS_893730]’s 
names will be kept on a password protected database and will be linked only with 
a study identification number for this research .  There are no patient identifiers 
recorded in the research record. All computer entry and networking programs will 
be done using study identification only.  All data will be entered into a computer 
that is password protected.  Clinical information will n ot be released without 
written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the 
FDA, the OHRP, the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s designee.  Data will be stored in a 
locked office of the investigators and maintained for a minimum of thr ee years 
after the completion of the study.  
The consent for the study will encompass the contraceptive counseling and 
follow -up call or text and medical record review to assess the primary and 
secondary outcomes. All participants will be given the opportun ity to ask 
questions and decline participation. Completed consent documentation will be 
SHORT TITLE: Reducing Pregnancy in the ED  
 Page 24 of 36 Version 3 dated 07.02.21 signed and dated by [CONTACT_519697], and a copy will be provided to the 
participant.  
23.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
 
Provider /OOP: Research -relate d injury would be highly unlikely and there will be no 
compensation for research -related injury. If study providers feel they need to receive 
care, they will need to obtain it on their own.  
 
Adolescents: Being in this study involves no more than minimal ri sk, therefore we 
do not require compensation for research -related injuries.   
 
Economic Burden to Subjects  
 
Training for providers  will be provided free of cost  and there should be no additional 
economic burden to study providers . 
A 3-month supply of non-LARC  study related medications , plus [ADDRESS_893731] provide their own transportation for any  medical follow -up 
visits that may be needed .  If an adolescent decides to begin a method of 
contraception, follow -up care may be sought at a local Title X clinic or an y 
medical facility  preferred by [CONTACT_662299] a dolescents will be responsible 
for any ou t-of-pocket expenses which may be incurred .    
24.0 Permission/Assent/Consent Process  
Providers : A study team member will obtain provider s’ verbal  informed consent 
for study procedures.  
 
OOP: A study team member will obtain verbal consent for study procedures (i.e., 
semi -structured interview).  
 
Adolescent: If eligible, a study team member will obtain  the adolescent patient’s 
informed consent  if they are 18 years of age or assent if they are less than 18 
years of age  for the study procedures. HIPAA Authorization will be obtained as 
part of the consent procedures. Study team members will verify with the clinical 
care team that the patient has t he capacity to consent /assent .  
For both sites, subjects who are [ADDRESS_893732] their 
SHORT TITLE: Reducing Pregnancy in the ED  
 Page [ADDRESS_893733] practice 
guidelines established for  adolescent participation in sexual health research. For 
any adolescent who desires placement of a subdermal contraceptive implant, we 
will follow established clinical practice at each site and obtain written consent 
from the procedure from the participant  (if aged 18 years) or a guardian (for 
minor participants).  
Process to Document Permission/Assent/Consent  
Staff at each site will follow institutional standards for documentation. 
Documentation will be stored i n a secured setting only accessible to s tudy staff.   
25.[ADDRESS_893734] within Children’s Mercy Adele Hall campus and the 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_490146] . Most of the study procedures will be 
conducted in the emergency department.  
26.0 Resources Available  
 
Providers : Study team members and leaders will be readily available by [CONTACT_662300] -
person to resolve any issues that arise. The leadership teams representing the ED 
Providers also support this project and are available to provide assistance if needed.  
 
Adolescents : Participants are not required to answer questions that make them feel 
uncomfortable. In the emergency department, there are always advocates available for 
patients and families, if needed, including health care providers, social workers, and 
patient advo cates. In this study setting, if a participant expresses a concern or need that is 
outside of the scope of this project (e.g., sexual assault), we will refer those participants 
back to their ED treating team, as is our standard practice. During the consent  process, we 
will inform participants that most of the information they share during the study will be 
kept confidential except in rare cases where their safety is at risk or mandated reporting is 
in effect .

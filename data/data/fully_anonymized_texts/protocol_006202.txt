ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE 
The study will comprise 10 on-site visits AND 9 phone calls:  
 
• Visits: 
 
- V1 screening visit between D -28 and Day -1 
- V2 baseline visit at D1 (first dosing) 
- during the treatment period*:  
- visit every 2 weeks from V2 to V5 - every 6 weeks from V5 to V6 - every 12 weeks from V6 to V8 
- every 16 weeks from V8 to V9 (Week 52; last         dosing) 
- V10 follow-up visit at Week 64 - A time window of ±2 days will be allowed for each visit
 
 
• Phone calls: 
 
- For safety considerations at Weeks 8, 16, 20, 28, 32, 40, 44, 48 
during the treatment period and at Week 58 during the follow-up 
period. 
 
*IMP administration being every week. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: Based on prior clinical trial experience in IPF patients, it is estimated that 
the standard deviation (SD) of the absolute change in % predicted FVC 
at 52 weeks is approximately 12%.  Fo r the primary efficacy parameter of 
absolute change in % predicted FVC, 92 patients per treatment group will yield 80% power to detect a 5 perc entage point difference between the 
treatment groups and placebo.  Additional patients will be randomized in 
each regimen to allow for dropouts; therefore, approximately 100 patients

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 2  21-Jul-2015 
SAR156597-DRI11772 Version number:  1 
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 8 will be randomized into each treatment group, for a total sample size of 
approximately 300 patients for the study. 
Analysis sets: 
Safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety population, which 
includes all randomized patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_994221]. Efficacy analyses will be performed on 
the modified intent to treat popul ation (primary population), which 
includes all patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_994222] a valid baseline % predicted FVC measurement, 
and have at least [ADDRESS_994223]-baseline % predicted FVC measurement. The 
primary statistical analysis will be performed once all patients have 
completed the Week 52 assessment and the database has been cleaned 
and locked. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
A rank-based analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed on the 
change from baseline in % predicted FVC. The ANCOVA model will 
include treatment group as the main factor and the baseline % predicted 
FVC as a continuous covariate.  
Analysis of secondary endpoints 
Analysis of time to event endpoints will be performed using the log-rank 
test and Cox proportional hazards regression model. 
Safety analysis 
TEAEs and serious AEs (SAEs) (will be summarized for each treatment 
group by [CONTACT_727994] (SOC), high level group term 
(HLGT), high level term (HLT), and preferred term (PT), as well as by [CONTACT_78621]. The rate of potentially 
clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) will also be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Additionally, listings of all AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation will be generated.  Clinical laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, electrocardi ograms (ECGs), a selected panel of 
biomarkers, and ADA will be tabulated by  [CONTACT_1570]. These safety 
analyses will be compared qualitatively between the treatment groups.  
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per patient)  The study will last 68 weeks per patient as follows: 
• 4 weeks of screening 
• 52 weeks of study treatment 
• 12 weeks of follow-up with no study treatment

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prog ressive, diffuse, and distinct chronic fibrosing 
interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause that is uni formly fatal with a median survival of 
approximately 3 years ( 1). The clinical course of IPF is vari able and not predictable; the rate of 
decline and progression to death may take several clinical forms: slow physiologic deterioration 
with worsening severity of dyspnea, rapid dete rioration, and progression to death, or periods of 
relative stability interposed with periods of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_727970] ( 2). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_727971] a “rare 
disease”, even though international studies seem to report an increasing incidence, with current 
estimates between 4.6 and 16.3 per 100 000 person-years and a prevalence of 13 to 20 cases per 100 000 (( 3), (4), (5)). There is a higher predominance of the disease in men (1.5 to 1.7:1) than in 
women and the frequency increases with age ( 5). The most important environmental risk factors 
are cigarette smoking, exposur e to metal and wood dust( 1), and infectious agents including both 
viruses and bacteria( 6). Genetic transmission occurs in a bout 0.5% to 3.7% of patients with IPF 
(7). The diagnosis of IPF often requires a multid isciplinary approach, involving pulmonologists, 
radiologists, and pathologists experienced in the field of interstitial lung diseases( 8). The 
pathogenic mechanisms are unclear, but a growing body of evidence indicates that the disease is 
the result of an abnormal behavior of the alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_727972], 
proliferation, and activation of  mesenchymal cells, with the formation of fibroblast and 
myofibroblast foci. Activated myofibroblasts se crete exaggerated amounts of extracellular matrix 
molecules with the subsequent dest ruction of the lung architecture ( 9). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735] (Esbriet®, 
[COMPANY_002]), an oral drug that is hypothesized to i nhibit the synthesis of transforming growth factor-
beta, was approved so far in Japan, China and in the European Union for the treatment of IPF. Very recently, the FDA approved pi[INVESTIGATOR_727973] (Ofev®),an oral kinase 
inhibitor for the treatment of IPF. Per labeling information, these two drugs were shown to significantly reduce the decline of lung functi on as compared to placebo. No statistically 
significant effect on death was demonstrated. Lu ng transplantation is the only therapy that 
prolongs survival in advanced IPF, although the post-transplantation 5-year survival for patients 
with IPF is about 48% ( 10). Interleukin 4 (IL)-4 and interleuki n 13 (IL-13) are structurally related 
cytokines expressed by T helper type [ADDRESS_994235] 
1 receptor subunit (IL-4R alpha) ( 11), ( 12). Elevations in IL-[ADDRESS_994236] 
been linked to the pathogenesis of IPF ( 13), ( 14). In IPF patients, IL-13 and IL-4 levels in 
bronchial alveolar lavage fluid are el evated compared to normal controls ( 15). Such evidence 
suggests that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_727974]. SAR156597 is an engineered humanized bispecific IgG4 antibody that binds and neutraliz es both IL-4 and IL-13. It utilizes an innovative 
tetravalent bispecific tandem immunoglobulin form at to combine the antigen binding domains of 
an anti-IL-4 antibody and an anti-IL-13 antibod y into a single molecule. SAR156597 shows high 
affinity for IL-4 and IL-13 from both humans and cynomolgus monkeys, and each antibody has 
binding sites for 2 IL-4 and 2 IL-13 cytokines.

SAR156597-DRI11772  Version number:  [ADDRESS_994237] of the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of 2 dose levels/regimens 
of SAR156597 administered subcutaneously ov er a 52-week treatment period and, the 
determination of the optimal dose level/regimen for the treatment of patients with IPF. 
It will be a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-c ontrolled, 3-parallel group study 
conducted in out-patients suffering from IPF a ccording to the American Thoracic Society/ 
European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764]/ Japanese Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764]/ Latin American Thoracic 
Association (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT) guideline criteria and confirmed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts in IPF. 
Patients who discontinue treatment during the study will be followed for the full planned 52 week 
duration of the study in order to ensure the collection of efficacy outcomes on all randomized 
patients and minimize the potential for bias in analyses due to missing data. 
4.2.2 Design rationale 
The 52-week treatment duration is based on published data from clinical trials in IPF and also 
from IPF natural history data that respectively showed evidence for treatment-induced changes on surrogate endpoints and significant decline in respi[INVESTIGATOR_727975] a 12-month period. 
The follow-up period of 12 weeks after dosing for adverse events (AEs) and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analysis is appropriate taking into account the estimated half-life of about [ADDRESS_994238] that its inhibition will be fully achieved. 
Additionally, SAR156597 has been shown to redu ce in a dose dependent manner (up to 200 mg 
once a week) the plasma level of TARC, a protei n biomarker involved in the IL-4/IL-[ADDRESS_994239], 
after 6 weeks of treatment in patients with IPF. 
As the desired dose frequency for patient conve nience is once every 2 weeks, the weekly dose 
regimen for the 200 mg dose level will be compar ed to the every 2 weeks dose regimen for 200 
mg.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 23 Finally, modelling and simulations based on the PK data from the multiple dose clinical study 
(TDR11326) have confirmed that a 200 mg dose administered once every 2 weeks and once a 
week give an acceptable safety margin in terms of exposure ratio (monkey AUC at 
NOAEL/human AUC) of ~6 and ~3 respectively. 
4.2.3 Rationale for the use of outcome measures 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) 
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) will be assessed during the study. Pulmonary function tests, such 
as spi[INVESTIGATOR_727976] l ung capacity (DLCO), are standard evaluations for 
patients with IPF. Changes in forced vital cap acity (FVC) and DLCO have been shown to be 
correlated with survival ( 17). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and Pulse Oximetry 
The 6-MWT with oximetry will be used in this study. It is a safe and reproducible procedure for patients with IPF. Baseline desaturation during a 6MWT is a powerful predictor of subsequent 
mortality ( 18) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lung High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) 
A significant correlation between high-resoluti on computed tomography (HRCT) visual score and 
lung function tests both at diagnosis and at follow-up has been shown and reported in the 
literature. The HRCT study is able to identify and quantify anatomic IPF and also to evaluate the progression of the disease. In clinical practice, the HRCT visual score of disease extent can be 
used in association with function tests to mon itor IPF evolution, and to evaluate prognosis and 
therapy ( 19). 
[IP_ADDRESS] St George Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ) 
Impact of IPF on quality of life will be assessed using the SGRQ ( 20). This questionnaire covers 
the measurement of symptoms, activity, and imp acts. It has good discriminative and evaluative 
properties and is responsive to therapeutic trials. It takes 8 to 15 minutes to complete. 
[IP_ADDRESS] EuroQol Questionnaire, 5 level system (EQ-5D-5L) 
The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument fo r use as a measure of health outcome.  
EQ-5D-5L is the 5-level system for the 5-dime nsional format of the EQ-5D and covers the 
measurement of mobility, self-care, usual ac tivities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. 
EQ-5D-5L is designed for self-completion by s ubjects, taking less than 5 minutes to complete. 
Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 24 [IP_ADDRESS] Biomarkers 
Peripheral blood will be collected for measurement of protein biomarkers in serum or plasma.  
The protein biomarkers have been selected either based on their pot ential link with SAR156597 
mechanism of action, based on reported association with survival in or pathogenesis of IPF or lung fibrosis. These include, but are not limited to, inter-cellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), TARC, periostin and Human Epi[INVESTIGATOR_727977] 4 (H E4). In a previous observational longitudinal 
study (ASY12295), some of these biomarkers show ed a higher circulating concentration at 
baseline in IPF patients compared to healthy controls, with estimated AUROC above or close to 0.8.  On exploratory basis, the correlation between IPF disease biomarkers and lung function 
progression will be assessed at Week 24 and Week 52.  Moreover, in another previous clinical 
study with increasing doses of SAR156597 (T DR11326) promising results were observed for 
some of these markers, e.g. a trend in reduced blood concentration of TARC with increasing doses 
of SAR156597. Drug-related protein biomarkers will be assessed at  baseline, Week [ADDRESS_994240] on thes e proteins after 6 months and 12 months of SAR156597 treatment.  
 
Additional blood samples will be archived for potential fu ture assay of protein and mRNA 
biomarkers related to the diagnosis, progression, or therapeutic responsiveness of IPF 
[IP_ADDRESS] Genetic testing  
The genetic basis of IPF is not well understood.  Polymorphisms of various genes encoding for 
cytokines and mucins have been reported to be increased in sporadic IPF.  To obtain a better 
understanding of IPF pathogenesis and disease co urse in relation to th e genomic profile, blood 
samples will be collected to further characterize the genotype of IPF subjects by [CONTACT_227976] a subset of selected genes already associated to IPF including but not limited to IL4 ( 21), IL4R ( 22), 
STAT6 ( 23) and MUC5B ( 24).

125 mg of SAR156597 freeze-dried powder, a nd the final solution for injection is 
obtained by [CONTACT_727998] 1.1 mL of water for 
injection, leading to an amount of 125 mg  of SAR156597 drug substance in a total 
volume of 1.25 mL, that is a 100 mg/mL of SAR156597 solution. 1 mL of this 100 mg/mL SAR156597 solution can then be withdrawn for dose administration. [ADDRESS_994247] vials are thus needed to reach a 200 mg dose. 
o Placebo consists of liquid with the same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_727978]156597 formulation, filled at nominal volume of 1.5 mL. Two vials are necessary, 1 mL will be taken from each vial to prepare 2 mL syringe. 
• Method of preparation 
At the study site, reconstitution of the IMP mu st be done by [CONTACT_727999] (e.g. pharmacist) to maintain the treatment blind (Refer to Section  8.4). 
o At patient’s home, reconstitution must be done by [CONTACT_129000] (e.g.

The route and method of administration are s ubcutaneous in the abdomen. Subcutaneous 
injection sites should be alternated between th e 4 quadrants of the abdomen (avoiding navel 
and waist areas) so that the same site is not injected for two consecutive weeks. Exact site of 
each injection will be docum ented on source document. 
 
The IMP is administered every 7 days +/- 2 days from initial IMP administration. This is permitted per protocol to accommodate special circumstances, eg . laboratory results pending, 
ongoing AE, patient scheduling difficulty.   If IMP administration is missed or temporarily discontinued, the initial schedule of injections should be resumed. This does not apply to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
 On days when the patient has a study visit, the IMP will be administered by [CONTACT_728000].   
 For doses not administered at the study site, the IMP will be administered by [CONTACT_728001] /or healthcare  professionals (e.g. visiting nurse service).  
 Patients should be monitored by s ite personnel/visiting nurse for at  least [ADDRESS_994248] a hypersensitivity reaction.  
[For Czech Republic only per local requirement: Patients should be monitored at the study 
site by [CONTACT_650787] a minimum of [ADDRESS_994249] a hypersensitivity  reaction. For the subsequent IMP administrations, patients should

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 35 8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an adverse event (AE), the code should only be broken in circumstances when 
knowledge of the IMP is required for treating the patient. If possible, c ontact should be initiated 
with the monitoring team before breaking the code.  
Code breaking can be performed at any time by [CONTACT_328728] (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) and/or by [CONTACT_728003] e.  If the blind is broken, the Investigator 
should document the date, time of day, and reason for code breaking.   
If the blind is broken by [CONTACT_737], for the above stated purpose, the patient must be 
withdrawn from treatment.  
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
Patient will be randomized followi ng a 1:1:1 ratio to one of th e three treatment arms via a 
centralized randomization system using IVRS/IWRS. A randomized treatment kit number list will be generated centrally by [CONTACT_13225]. The investigational 
product (SAR156597 or placebo) will be packag ed in accordance with this list. 
At V1 (screening) the study staff will contact [CONTACT_21926]/IWRS to obtain a patient number for each 
patient who gives informed consent. 
The result from the central reviewer on diagnosis of IPF have to be obtained to validate the 
inclusion of patient before randomization as per inclusion criteria (See section Section  7.1) 
The population will be stratified according to background therapy at the moment of 
randomization: 
- Patient with background therapy with either pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365]  
- versus patient without background therapy  
- It is planned to include a maximum of 66% of patients with background therapy. 
Randomization will be performed at Visit 2 (Day 1) by a centralized randomization procedure 
using IVRS/IWRS. 
Patients who comply with all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned before the IMP 
administration on Visit 2 (Day 1): 
• A treatment number in a preplanned orde r following the randomization list, and 
• A patient number according to the chronological order of inclusion. 
A patient cannot be randomized more than once in the clinical trial.

[IP_ADDRESS] Protection of subject identity and genetic sample/data handling 
The Sponsor has included safeguards for protecting subject confidentiality.   The blood sample and 
DNA that is extracted will be assigned a second number, a Genetic ID (de-identification code) 
that is different from the Subject ID.  This “double coding” is  performed to sepa rate a subject’s 
medical information and DNA data.  The clinical study data (coded by [CONTACT_7918]) will be stored 
in a distinct database at a different location from the database containing the genetic data (coded by [CONTACT_181277]).  The key linking Subject ID and Genetic ID will be maintained by a third party, under appropriate access control.  The matching of clinical data and genetic  data, for the purpose 
of data analysis, will be possible only by [CONTACT_728013], which will be under strict access control.  
All data will be reported only in coded form in order to maintain confidentiality. 
Any remaining banked blood samp les and associated DNA will be discarded according to local 
regulations and operating procedures within 15 year s of issuance of the Clinical Study Report for 
DRI11772. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Optional stored DNA sample 
For those patients who signed the optional pha rmacogenetic informed consent form, a blood 
sample will be collected at the study visit as specified in the study flow chart and this sample will 
be stored.  
This sample may be used to determine a possi ble relationship between genes and response to 
treatment with SAR156597, how the body processes SAR156597 and possible side effects to 
SAR156597. Genes that may be studied include those for the IL4 receptor, IL4, MUC5B and 
additional genes that may potentially be part of the Th2 signaling pathway.  
This blood sample will be transfer red to a site that will, on beha lf of [COMPANY_011], extract DNA from the 
sample and that is managed by a contractor which can be located outside the country where the 
study is conducted, within or out side of the European Union. 
This blood sample, and the DNA that is extracted  from it, will be assigned a second number, a 
Genetic ID (deidentification code) that is diffe rent from the Subject ID. This “double coding” is 
performed to separate a subject’s  medical information and DNA data. 
The clinical study data (coded by [CONTACT_7918]) will be stored in the clinical data management 
system (CDMS), which is a distinct database in a separate environm ent from the database 
containing the pharmacogenetic data (coded by  [CONTACT_181277]). The key linking Subject ID and 
Genetic ID will be maintained by a third party, under appropriate access control.  The matching of clinical data and pharma cogenetic data, for the purpose of da ta analysis, will be possible only by 
[CONTACT_181278], which will be under strict access control. All data will be  reported only in coded 
form in order to maintain confidentiality. 
The DNA will be stored for up to 15 years from the completion of the clinical study report.

study flow chart and these samples will be stored. These samples may be used for other research purposes (excluding genetic analysis) related to IP F than those defined in the present protocol.  
These other research analyses will help to understa nd either disease subtypes or drug response, or 
to develop and/or validate a bi oassay method, or to identify new drug targets or biomarkers.  
These samples will remain labelled with the same identifiers than the one used during the study 
(i.e., subject ID). They will be transferred to a [COMPANY_011] site (or a subcontractor site) which can be 
located outside of the country where the study is conducted. The Sponsor has included safeguards 
for protecting subject confiden tiality and personal data (see Section  14.3 and  Section 14.5). 
9.5 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
See also Section  4.2.3 
The primary endpoint will be the mean absolute ch ange from baseline in percent predicted FVC at 
52 weeks. FVC is a widely used measure of pu lmonary function and dise ase status in patients 
with IPF. Percent predicted FVC is a reliable, va lid, and responsive measure of clinical status and 
a decline of 2-6% represents a small but clinically important differe nce. Regarding disease 
progression, a decline in % predicted FVC greater th an or equal to 10% at 24 weeks was shown to 
be associated with a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of mortality over the subsequent year, 
whereas a decline of 5-10% conferred a more than twofold increase in the risk of 1-year mortality 
(26) (27). 
Secondary and exploratory efficacy outcome meas ures will address other aspects of disease 
progression and will include rate of deaths, rate of lung transplantations, rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
and rate of acute exacerbations. Finally, the extent of lung fibrosis and the effect of drug treatment 
on fibrosis will be measured using a specific scoring system on lung HRCT.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product an d which does not necessar ily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 
Intensity of an AE is defined as: 
• Mild: no modification of daily activities and does not require mandatory 
corrective/symptomatic treatment 
• Moderate: hinders normal daily activities and/or requires mandatory corrective/symptomatic treatment 
• Severe: prevents daily activities and requires mandatory corrective/symptomatic treatment 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
 Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
 the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which  hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_56385], or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a medically important event 
 Medical and scientific judg ment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
 reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
 be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56386] (ie, specific measures or corrective 
 treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.

o If any suspected transmission of an infec tious agent via a medicinal product (e.g. 
product contamination).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an  AE (serious or non-ser ious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, fo r which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by [CONTACT_56481] e Sponsor is required. Such events may require 
further pre-specified investigation/monitoring in order to characterize and understand them.

[IP_ADDRESS] Anaphylaxis 
Allergic reaction is a potential risk associated with the administration of most therapeutic 
monoclonal antibodies. 
Acute allergic reactions may be defined as allergic reaction-mediated signs and symptoms 
experienced by [CONTACT_728019]. 
These reactions may present in a variety of ways, including dizziness, headache, anxiety, dyspnea, 
hypotension, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, urticar ial/angioedema, flushing, nausea, or vomiting. 
Anaphylaxis may represent the most severe form of infusion reaction, but these events may also 
occur via other immune-mediated mechanisms (e.g .cytokine-mediated). Allergic reactions may 
begin within few hours and persist up to [ADDRESS_994281] dosing. Refer to APPENDIX D “Definition 
of anaphylaxis”, which describes the clinical  criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. 
Patients should be monitored by [CONTACT_728020] (if injection performed at patient’s 
home) for at least [ADDRESS_994282] for any signs or 
symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction.  
[For Czech Republic only, per local requirement: Patients should be monito red at the study site 
by [CONTACT_728021] [ADDRESS_994283] 1 hour after 
the next 5 administrations for any signs or symptoms of a hypersens itivity reaction. For the

[IP_ADDRESS] Allergic adverse event with cutaneous involvement 
Adverse events with cutaneous involvement which are obviously of allergic  origin or injection 
site reactions which progress/ex pand/worsen/etc. should be evalua ted by a dermatologist as soon 
as possible, and preferably within one week of the site first becoming aware of the event.   
The Investigator should evaluate the patient for possible etiologies (new medications, etc.) and 
extracutaneous symptoms and signs.  An uns cheduled Central Laboratory assessment for 
hematology, chemistry, liver pane l, PK, and ADA should be obtained. If it is possible, the site will 
take pi[INVESTIGATOR_727988]’s 
visit. If the photos are obtained, then copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] s hould be kept as source documents which may later 
be collected by [CONTACT_456]. The Investigator will provide a summary of the patient's case, reason for consultation, and informati on being requested to the consulting dermatologist.   
A full consultation report should be sent by [CONTACT_56488].  The full report 
should contain, at a minimum, the following info rmation; a detailed desc ription of the skin 
reaction (such as the morphology [lesion type], shape of individual lesions, arrangement of multiple lesions [e.g. scattered, grouped, linear], distribution, color, consistency, presence of 
pruritus or pain, and other clinical signs) a nd, in case a skin biopsy was done based on the 
dermatologist’s or Investigator’s medical judgment , the results of this investigation (including 
histopathology and immunoflurosecence) , with, if applicable, a specific diagnosis of the AE to be 
reported in the verbatim. The Investigator will email or fax the full report and the corrected AE form if necessary, to the Monitoring Team Representative within 24 hours.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 71 11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
Approximately 300 patients will be  randomized in this study, 100 per treatment group.  Based on 
the enrollment in prior studies of this population a pproximately half of the patients are expected to 
be older than 65.  
The sample size calculations are based on the pr imary efficacy variable of % predicted FVC 
change from baseline to week 52, with the following assumptions:  
• A common standard deviation of  12% is assumed based on the data from previous trials 
(26) 
• A 5 % mean difference between each dose and placebo in change from baseline in % 
predicted FVC 
• A 2-sided 5% significance  level with 80% power 
Ninety two (92) patients per treatment group will yield 80% power to detect a 5 percentage point 
difference between the treatment groups and plac ebo.  Additional patients will be randomized in 
each regimen to allow for dropouts; therefore, ap proximately 100 patients w ill be randomized into 
each treatment group, for a total sample size of approximately 300 patients for the study. 
As a rank-based method will be used for anal ysis the actual power may differ from these

11.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
11.3.1 Efficacy populations 
[IP_ADDRESS] Modified intent-to-treat population 
The primary population for analysis will be the modified ITT (mITT) population: ITT population 
with an evaluable primary endpoint. This will consist of all patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_994285] a valid baseline % predicted FVC 
measurement, and have at least one pos t-baseline % predicted FVC measurement. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_994286] 1 dose or part of a 
dose of IMP analyzed according to the treatment actually received.   
In addition:  
• Non randomized but treated patie nts will not be part of th e safety population, but their 
safety data will be presented separately.  
• Randomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will 
be included in the safety  population as randomized. 
• For patients receiving more than [ADDRESS_994287] one sample. 
11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_179650].

Duration of IMP exposure is defined as:  last dose date – first dose date + 14 days, regardless of 
unplanned intermittent discontinuations.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Compliance  
A given administration will be c onsidered noncompliant if the pa tient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required by [CONTACT_760].  No imputation will be made for patients with 
missing or incomplete data. 
Treatment compliance, above-p lanned and under-planned dosing pe rcentages will be summarized 
descriptively (N, Mean, SD, Medi an, Min, and Max). The percentage  of patients with compliance 
<80% will be summarized. In addition, number and percentage of patients with at least 1 above-
planned dosing administration will be given, as well as the number and percentage of patients 
with 0, (0, 20%), and >20% unde r-planned dosing administrations. 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint(s) 
Due to the non-normality of the endpoint distri bution, a two-sided rank-based analysis of 
covariance (rank ANCOVA) model adjusted for ba seline, will be used to compare the primary 
efficacy variable between each ac tive treatment group and placebo: 
 Change from baseline in the % predicted FVC at Week 52 
The rank ANCOVA will be performed as follows: 1. The first step of the analysis is to compute the standardized ranks of the response variable 
(change from baseline in % predicted FVC at Week 52) and covariate (baseline % predicted FVC)  
2. The second step is to perform the ANCOVA analysis based upon these ranks.  Within the 
ANCOVA each active treatment group will be compared to placebo using a contrast.  
In the primary analysis, Week 52 assessments will be used regardless of whether the patient has 
previously discontinued treatment.  For patients with missing data at week 52, the week 52 value 
will be estimated based on a linear regression using all available % predicted FVC measurements.  Predicted changes greater than zero (increases above baseline) will be set to zero.  For patients with no Week 52 value due to the patients death (or transplant), the value for analysis will be assigned the lowest (worst) rank. Sensitivity analys es including an analysis of the on-treatment 
data only will be described in the statistical analysis plan.

variable.  Patients not meeting the definition for disease progression will be considered censored 
at the time of their week [ADDRESS_994288] ratio compared to  placebo will be estimate d from a Cox proportional 
hazards model. 
The incidence of all-cause mortality will be calculated, but no hypothesis testing will be 
performed for this endpoint. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Multiplicity considerations 
The overall type I error rate for this study is 5%.  A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the type I error over the two doses.  The qw dose group will be compared to placebo first, 
and only if this comparison is significant w ill the q2w dose group be compared to placebo. 
The same procedure will be used for the diseas e progression endpoint if significance is achieved 
for both doses on the primary endpoint. 
11.4.3 Analyses of safety data 
The summary of safety results will be presented by [CONTACT_728023].  
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population using the following common rules: 
• The baseline value is defined generally as the last available valu e before randomization. 
• For quantitative safety parameters based on central laboratory/reading measurements, 
descriptive statistics will be used to summarize results and change from baseline values by 
[CONTACT_3232]. 
• The analysis of the safety variables will be essentially descriptive and no hypothesis testing is planned. 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG: 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by [CONTACT_56493]/thresholds based on lite rature review and defined by  [CONTACT_326932], vital signs, and ECG.

H.A. Sampson et al – J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2006; vol 117, n°2: 391-7. 
 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one  of the following 3 criteria are fullfilled: 
Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (e.g. generalized hives, prur itus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) 
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING 
a Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g. dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia) 
b Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g. hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue e.g. generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g. dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia) 
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g. hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. crampy, abdominal pain, vomiting) 
Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic 
BP* 
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person's 
baseline 
PEF, peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229]; BP, blood pressure 
*Low systolic blood pressure for children is  defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg = [2 x a ge]) from 1 to 10 
years and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.

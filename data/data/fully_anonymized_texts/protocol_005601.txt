Medic al Center  and the Plaza  Ambulatory  Surgery  Center  will be included

General Information  
 Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is a common procedure performed in the US with roughly 500,000 
cases occurring annually. Many surgeons prescribe opi[INVESTIGATOR_284270]. Given the current opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817], studies  ought to determine the true 
necessity of their use to prevent unnecessary narcotic  usage.  
 
Background Information  
 Endoscopic sinus surgery is an extraordinarily common procedure performed in the US. Currently, 
there is no standardized postoperative pain r egimen. Generally, most surgeons prescribe opi[INVESTIGATOR_284271]. Traditionally, 
rhinologists have avoided the use of non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to fear of 
increased bleeding risks in the postoperative period. However, opi[INVESTIGATOR_284272], 
including respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], constipation, addiction, and nausea/vomiting. Recently, our group 
has found the use of NSAIDs to be safe and effective in the postoperative period. There is now 
equipoise regarding the medication of choice for pain control after FESS. No definitive study has 
compared the level of pain control in patients receiving NSAIDs to those receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_284273]. In fact, there is a significant paucity of data regarding postoperative 
pain scores in patients undergoing  ESS. 
 Our hypothesis is that NSAIDs, specifically diclofenac, are safe and effective in the postoperative 
period after ESS. We believe that  NSAIDs will provide pain relief that is non -inferior to opi[INVESTIGATOR_284274]. To our knowledge, no studies have compared the use of NSAIDs to opi[INVESTIGATOR_284275]. If our hypothesis is true, this study will provid e the basis for a 
significant shift in prescribing patterns following ESS and obviate the need of opi[INVESTIGATOR_284276] 500,000 patients undergoing ESS  annually.  
 
Objectives  
UT Houston Protocol Template  
Adapted from NIH protocol template and ICH Guidelines  IRB NUMB EPRag: eHS3Co-fM6S-18-0242  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/26/2018    Our primary objective is to compare overall pain score (10 cm visual analog scale) at [ADDRESS_347062] - 
surgery between patients receiving diclofenac sodium to those receiving acetaminophen - 
hydrocodone following ESS and/or  septoplasty.  
 Secondary objectives w ill be to compare average, most severe, and least severe [ADDRESS_347063] -surgery between patients receiving diclofenac sodium to 
those receiving acetaminophen -hydrocodone following ESS. Additional secondary obje ctives will be 
to determine the rate of bleeding complications in patients receiving diclofenac sodium to those 
receiving acetaminophen -hydrocodone following ESS as well as noting the rates of constipation and 
nausea/vomiting in each group.  
 
Study Design  
 We propose to perform a randomized, controlled study to compare the safety and efficacy of 
diclofenac sodium when compared to the acetaminophen -hydrocodone following ESS. Patients will 
be randomized  by [CONTACT_22123] -generated  sequencing  in conjunction  with  a standard  envelope  system.  
 Our primary outcome will be the overall pain score on a 100 mm visual analog scale at 24 hours 
following  ESS. 
 Secondary outcome measures will be the overall pain scores, most severe pain score experienced in 
the [ADDRESS_347064] axis as 
well as rates of constipation and nausea/vomiting among participants in each  group.  
 
Study Population  
 Inclusion criteria will be English speaking adults (age >18) who are candidates for endoscopic sinus 
surgery as determined by [CONTACT_284282].  
 Exclusion  criteria  will be allergy  to either  NSAIDs  or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],  contraindication  to NSAIDs  (ex. gastritis, 
chronic kidney disease), surgical plan exceeding basic endoscopic sinus surgery, use of anti - 
coagulation, the presence of any pain disorder, the current usage of any analgesic medication, 
history of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827], pregnancy, his tory of chronic pain or fibromyalgia, current daily use of 
NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opi[INVESTIGATOR_265399] (pregabalin, tramadol,  etc).  
 All patients scheduled for surgery will be offered inclusion in the  study.  
 
Study Procedures  
 This study will require no additional study visits beyond the routine clinical postoperative  visits.  
 An electronic  REDCap  database  will be created  and postoperative  pain  surveys  will be emailed  to 
each patient at [ADDRESS_347065] -ESS. 
 Background information including age, sex, history of migraines, temporomandibular joint disorder, 
fibromyalgia, pain disorders and the current use of pain medication or NSAIDs will be input into the 
REDCap database prior to surgery.  
 
Data and Safety Monit oring  
 No adverse  events  are expected.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_284277].  
 Any unexpected events (including adverse events, protocol deviations, other problems) will be 
reported directly to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_284278].  
UT Houston Protocol Template

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/26/2018    On the first day of every month after study initiation, information regarding bleeding events 
experienced postoperatively will be reviewed. In the event of a >5% increase in bleeding rate in the 
group receiving diclofenac, the study will be  halted.  
 
Statis tics 
 Based off of a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_284279] [ADDRESS_347066] deviation of  22.8.  
 Sample calculations were performed for a non -inferiority limit of 15mm on the 100mm VAS score, 
90% power,  alpha of 0.025, with an estimated standard deviation of  22.8.  
 41 patients are calculated to be required in each group for a total patient count of  82 
 Due to roughly  an anticipated  10%  dropout  (failure  to complete  survey  at 24 hours),  we plan  to 
recruite 100  patients  
 Interim  analysis  for safety  purposes  will only  be performed  via the proportionality  test for epi[INVESTIGATOR_284280]’s office. The anticipated baseline 
rate for this complication is 1 % each month of the trial. The trial will be terminated if a significant 
number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_284281].  
 Analysis  for primary  and secondary  outcomes  will be performed  via a t-test for two independent 
means for pain scores at 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours after  FESS  
 Analysis of other secondary outcomes of patients’ experiences with epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], constipation, and 
nausea/vomiting is to be done via the proportionality  test 
 All randomized subjects wit h returned questionnaires will be included in the statistical  analysis.  
 Analysis is performed with STATA 14 (College Station,  TX) 
 
Ethics  
 IRB approval will be sought from  CPHS.  
 Patients  will be offered  inclusion  in the clinic  and will be consented  at that time  if they  elect  to 
participate.  
 
Data handling and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
 All data will be maintained in the UTHEALTH REDCap database. Data will only be accessible by [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigator  Saini.  
 The only identifying information that wi ll be stored in the REDCap database will be the patient’s 
Allscripts MRN and email address. Once all information is collected, medical record numbers and 
email  addresses  will be removed  from  the dataset  so that the information  is no longer  identifiable.  
 
Quality control and assurance  
 Co-investigator  Saini  will aggregate  data  directly  from  Allscripts  for input  into the REDCap  database. 
This will ensure that data is accurate, consistent, complete and  reliable.  
 There are no plans to have ongoing third party  monitoring.  
 
Publication Plan  
 The study  results  will be submitted  to the American  Rhinologic  Society  for oral presentation  for the 
Spring 2019  meeting.  
 The results will not be directly returned to the study  participants.

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_383922] A. Bernstein, M.D.  
Specific  Aims:  
Obsessive -compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  is a debilitating  anxiety  disorder  that afflicts  1-3% of youth,1,2  often  
causing  incapacitation  by [CONTACT_383944].  Although  effective  treatments  are available,  not all 
patients  respond .3   This highlights  the need  for research  to develop  new treatments.   The groundwork  for such  
developments  will require  neurobiological  research  that will (a) further  elucidate  the neural  mechanisms  of 
disease,  (b) characterize  the specific  changes  that underlie  response  to established  treatments,  and (c) 
demonstrate  the specific  neurobiology  in patients  who do not respond  to established  treatments . Previous  
research  has suggested  that dysregulation  of the frontal -striatal -thalamic  circuitry  (FSTC)  is associated  with 
OCD.4 Functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI)  studies  in children  and adults  with OCD  compared  to 
controls  have  shown  decreased  activation  in FSTC  regions  during  tasks  involving  cognitive  control .5-13 Also,  
emerging  research  in OCD  using  resting -state  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (R-fMRI)14-16 and 
diffusion  imaging  (DI) has begun  to identify  alterations  in connectivity  (i.e., connections  within  networks)  within  
FSTC  and points  to alterations  in connectivity  between  the frontal  cortex  and striatum (caudate  and putamen).  
In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 15 adolescents  with OCD (mostly  medicated)  and 12 controls,  we examined  22 specific  
connections  within  FSTC  (11 per hemisphere)  using  R-fMRI.  Findings  demonstrated  that in comparison  with 
controls,  adolescents  with OCD  show  significantly  lower  connect ivity and high effect  sizes  in 11 links.  Lower  
functional  connectivity  in 10 of these  segments   was associated  with significantly  higher   severity  on the 
Children’s  Yale-Brown  Obsessive  Compulsive  Scale  (CY-BOCS).17 Furthermor e, we examined  how specific  
dimensions  of OCD  would  map onto this circuitry.  We found  that bilaterally,  for cortical -subcortical  
connections,  the ordering/repeating  dimension  correlates  with orbitofrontal  cortex  (OFC) -subcortical  
connections,  the hoarding  dimension  correlates  with rostral  anterior  cingulate  cortex  (ACC) -subcortical  
connections,  and the forbidden  thoughts  dimension  correlates  with  caudal   ACC -subcortical   connections.  
These  data were  obtained  using  advances  in brain  imaging  acquisition  and analysis  that were  developed  at the 
University  of Minnesota  (UMN)  for the NIH-funded  Human  Connectome  Project (HCP).  We have  also begun  to 
show  that our imaging  tools  can reliably  and accurately  measure  structural  connectivity  within  deep  FSTC  
white  matter  connections  of interest.  Earlier  imaging  research  had limitations  (low spatial  and temporal  
resolution,  limited  ability  to resolve  crossing  white  matter  fibers,  and OFC  signal  drop)  that can be addressed  
with advances  at our site. Since  our pi[INVESTIGATOR_383923],  it is unclear  to 
what extent  the findings  reflect  effects  of disease,  treatment,  or both.  For example,  it may be that prior to 
medication  treatment,  group  differences  are even  larger  than what we detected,  and are then mitigated  by 
[CONTACT_3148].  Furthermore,  treatment  may alter some  parts  of FSTC  more  than others  and key changes  may 
underlie  treatment response,  which  are not seen  in non-responders.  
Selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  are the pharmacological  treatment  of choice  for pediatric  
OCD.18 Twelve  weeks  of sertraline,  an SSRI,  was found  to be moderately  effective  in decreasing  OCD  
symptoms  in the NIMH -funded  Pediatric  OCD  Treatment  Study  (POTS) .3 There  is some  fMRI  evidence  that 
SSRIs  reduce  brain  abnormalities  in patients  with OCD.19 We propose  to comprehensively  evaluate  FSTC  
using  a multi -modal  neuroimaging  approach  [R-fMRI  and high angular  resolution  diffusion  imaging  (HARDI)]  in 
25 unmedicated  adolescents  with OCD  and 25 matched  healthy  controls  to confirm  our pi[INVESTIGATOR_383924].  We will examine  how treatment  with sertraline  for 12 weeks  
impacts  FSTC  in this OCD  samp le. 
Specific  Aim #1: To examine  FSTC  using  advanced  multi -modal  imaging  techniques  (R-fMRI,  HARDI)  in 
25 medication -free youths  with OCD  (ages  8-17) in comparison  with 25 matched  healthy  controls.  
Hypotheses:  (A) Based  on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299],  youths  with OCD  will show  lower  functional  connectivity  in FSTC  
at baseline  when  compared  with controls,  and , lower  functional  connectivity  in FSTC  will correlate  with 
greater  severity  on CY-BOCS.  (B) Youths  with OCD  will also show  abnormalities  in structural  connectivit y in 
FSTC  at baseline  when  compared  with controls,  and structural  and functional  connectivity  will be related.  (C) 
We will explore  relations  between  OCD  dimensions  and functional  connectivity  measures,  and predict  that the 
repeating/ordering  dimension  will correlate  with OFC  connections,  hoarding  will correlate  with rostral  ACC  
connections,  and forbidden  thoughts  will correlate  with caudal  ACC  connections.  
Specific  Aim #2 (Exploratory):  To investigate  how sertraline  impacts  functional  connectivity  in FSTC  in 
adolescents  with OCD.  Hypothesis:  After  12 weeks  of sertraline  treatment,  functional  connectivity  measures  
within  FSTC  for the OCD  group  will (on average)  increase  compared  to baseline  and will no longer  be 
significantly  different  when  compared  with controls. Non-responders  may show  a different  pattern  (i.e. failure  to 
show  these  changes).  
A. Background  and Significance:  OCD  is a debilitating  anxiety  disorder  with a prevalence  rate of 1% to 
3% in youth.1,2 Children  and adolescents  with OCD  are often  incapacitated  by [CONTACT_383944].  
Up to 80% of OCD  cases  may begin  in childhood  or adolescence.20 Studying  youths  with OCD  (rather  than 
adults)  offers  the advant age of identifying  brain  differences  early  in development  when  confounding  factors  of 
chronicity  of symptoms  and interventions  (i.e., psychotropic  medications  and cognitive -behavioral  therapy  
[CBT])  are less likely  to be present.  FSTC  in OCD:  Neuroimaging  research  has implicated  FSTC  in OCD.  
This network  connects  neurons  in the frontal  cortex,  striatum  (i.e., caudate,  putamen),  thalamus,  and back to 
the frontal  cortex.4,21 See basic  diagram  of FSTC in Figure  1. Task  fMRI  studies  demonstrate  that participants  
with OCD  compared  to matched  healthy  controls  exhibit  lower  levels  of activation  of brain  regions  in FSTC  
regions .5-13 A review  of neuroimaging  studies  concluded  that results  from a variety  of imaging  techniques  
converge  to implicate  abnormalities  in FSTC  in pediatric  OCD.22 Theory  suggests  that abnormalities  in the 
FSTC  result in  obsessional  thoughts  and compulsive  behaviors.4 
Developmental  Framework  for 
Pediatric  OCD:  There  are clinical  and 
neuroimaging  differences  between  
childhood - and adult -onset  OCD.  
Pediatric  OCD  has male  predominance  
and is commonly  comorbid  with tic 
disorders  (30%) ,23 whereas  adult -onset  
is predominantly  female  and often  
comorbid  with depression.22 Childhood  
OCD is viewed  as a neurodevelopmental  
subtype  of OCD  based  on similarity  of its 
symptoms  to developmentally  normal  
childhood  rituals,24,25 and comorbidity  
with Tourette’s  disorder  (a 
neurodevelopmental  condition).  It is 
thought  to be related  to prefrontal -striatal  
abnormalities  that are 
neurodevelopmentall y  mediated.26 
Striatal  structures  mature  earlier  than 
prefrontal    regions    which    continue    to 
mature  into early  adulthood.27 During  development,  white  matter  changes  are primarily  due to increases  in 
myelination  which  fine-tune the connectivity  between  prefrontal  and subcortical  regions.27 Meta -analysis  of 
fMRI  studies  show  involvement  of OFC  and caudate  in adults  with OCD,28 whereas pediatric  OCD  studies  
indicate  involvement  of other  basal  ganglia  areas  (e.g.,  putamen)  and thalamus .29-31 Medication -naïve  youth  
with OCD  compared  with controls  demonstrate  greater  ACC  gray matter .30 These  differences  highlight  the 
importance  of utilizing  a developmental  approach  to studying  FSTC  in pediatric  OCD.  
Advanced  Neuroimaging  Technologies  for Connectivity:  Recent  advances  in neuroimaging  that 
assess  brain  “connectivity”  allow  for a sophisticated  understanding  of neural  networks.  Several  studies  have  
demonstrated  significant  differences  in connectivity  in the corticostriatal  link of this circuit  in adults14-[ADDRESS_480424]  identified  specific  connections  within  this network  that show  significantly  lower  
functional  connectivity  in adolescents  with OCD  compared  with controls  (see Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46476]).  We plan to evaluate  
brain  connectivity  in adolescents  using  two advanced,  noninvasive  technologies.  First,  R-fMRI  measures  the 
covariance  of blood -oxygen -level-dependent  (BOLD)  signals  between  brain  areas  (“functional  connectivity”).32 
Second,  HARDI33 is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_383925]  a number  of alternative  approaches  to 
inferring  fiber orientations  in white  matter.  Unlike  traditional  diffusion  tensor  imaging  (DTI),34 HARDI  
techniques  can resolve  complex  fiber architecture  within  a single  voxel  and permit  assessment  of 
microstructural  integrity  of white  matter  fiber tracts,33 indexing  the anatomical  strength  of connections  between  
brain  areas  (“structural  connectivity”).  Recently -developed  acquisition  schemes  at UMN35 enable  rapid  
collection  of both types  of connectivity  data to reduce  long acquisition  times  and minimize  motion  artifacts.  
Neuroimaging  Studies  Evaluating  Connectivity  in OCD:  Functional  Connectivity : Harrison  and 
colleagues15 found  reduced  functional  connectivity  between  the lateral  prefrontal  cortex  and dorsal  striatum  
and between  the ventral  striatum  and the midbrain  ventral  tegmental  area in 21 adults  with OCD (mostly  
medicated)  and 21 matched  healthy  controls.   Sakai  and associates16 used  R-fMRI  to study  20 medication -free 

adults  with OCD  and 23 matched  healthy  controls.  Significantly  greater  positive  functional  connectivity  was 
found  between  regions  of the frontal  cortex  and the ventral  striatum  in OCD  participants.  Fitzgerald  et al. 
examined  connectivity  between  OCD  and controls  in four developmental  age groups  [children  8-12 years  (n = 
11), adolescents  13-17 (n = 18), young  adults  18-25 (n = 18), and older  adults  26-40 (n = 13)].14 Half of the 
OCD  participants  were  on psychotropic  medications.  Across  all age groups,  OCD  patients  compared  with 
controls  showed  increased  connectivity  between  ventral  medial  frontal  cortex  and dorsal  striatum.  However,  
children  with OCD  showed  reduced  connectivity  between  rostral  ACC  and dorsal  striatum  (associated  with 
greater  OCD  severity),  and also between  dorsal  ACC  and medial  dorsal  thalamus.  No studies  have  report ed 
R-fMRI  results  on medication -free youths  with OCD.  Structural  Connectivity :  A handful  of studies  have  used  
DI to examine  white  matter  connectivity  in OCD,  with somewhat  mixed  findings.  The first DI study  in OCD  
found  that adult  patients  had lower  fractional  anisotropy  (FA) in the white  matter  of several  cortical  regions  
including  ACC,  parietal  cortex,  posterior  cingulate  gyrus,  and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_383926].  No areas  of significantly  higher  
FA were  found  in patients  compared  with healthy  controls.[ADDRESS_480425]  been  conducted  in pediatric  OCD.  
SSRI  Effects  in OCD:  Treatment -naïve  adults  with OCD (n = 13) exhibited  smaller  putamen  volume  which  
normalized  following  12 weeks  of SSRI  treatment .39 Treatment -naïve  children  with OCD  (N = 21) showed  
greater  thalamic  volume  which  normalized  after [ADDRESS_480426]  been  demonstrated  to be efficacious  in reducing  pediatric  OCD  
symp toms  in multiple  randomized  placebo -controlled  trials .18,40  In POTS,  12 weeks  of sertraline  was effective  
in reducing  OCD  symptoms  (ES = 0.67) .[ADDRESS_480427]. Bernstein  has years  of experience  treating  OCD  youths  with sertraline.  
B. Innovation:  Given  that OCD  may have  a neurodevelopmental  etiology  and that the networks  of 
interest  in OCD  undergo  considerable  refinement  throughout  childhood  and adolescence,  examination  of OCD  
circuitry  in youth  is critical.  Furthermore,  studying  unmedicated  youth  allows  for identifying  brain  differences  
without  the confound  of current  pharmacological  treatme nt. The proposed  study  is cutting  edge  because  we 
will use innovative  advanced  data acquisition  methods  for fMRI  and HARDI  that have  been  developed  at the 
UMN  as part of the NIH-funded  HCP.  These  tools  allow  us to collect  data with much  higher  temporal  and 
spatial  resolution  than has been  standard.  These  advantages  are important  for OCD,  a disease  that involves  a 
complex  circuitry  involving  deep  brain  areas  and orbitofrontal  regions  that have  been  difficult  to study  using  
standard  techniques.  We will look at change  in functional  connectivity  measures  in OCD  participants  
compared  with controls  after OCD  participants  receive  12 weeks  of sertraline.  This innovative  approach  will 
allow  us to examine  sertraline  treatment  effects  on neural  circuitry  in OCD.  To our knowledge,  this has never  
been  done  and will represent  an important  advance.  We hope  to identify  specific  connections  in the FSTC  that 
normalize  with response  to SSRI  treatment  and identify  links that do not change  in treatment  refractory  
participants.  We will also explore  OCD  dimensions  and their relations  with functional  connectivity  links to 
identify  possible  differences  in FSTC  in OCD subtypes.  
C. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_383927]:  Functional  and Structural  Connectivity  in Adolescents  with OCD  Seventeen  
adolescents  with OCD  and 13 controls  were  scanned  using  a 32 channel  head  coil on the 3T Human  
Connectome  scanner  (http://www.humanconnectome.org/about/project/MR -hardware.html ). Three  scans  were  
eliminated  ([ADDRESS_480428]  terminated  the scan  early  and 2 were  excluded  during  the “scrubbing”   process.41  
Anatomic  Acquisition : Whole  brain  anatomical  data with T1 contrast  were  acquired  in 5 minutes  using  an MP- 
RAGE  sequence  with 1 mm isotropic  resolution  (TR=2530  ms, TE=3.52  ms, TI=1100  ms, flip  angle=7  
degrees).  Processing  and Analysis : The T1 images  were  processed  using  FreeSurfer.  Regions  of interest  
(ROIs)  for each  structure  within  FSTC  were  identified  and later aligned  to both functional  and diffusion  images.  
R-fMRI:  Acquisitions : Resting  state  BOLD  data were  collected  using  a novel  multi -band  EPI [INVESTIGATOR_383928].35,42 Resting  scans  lasting  12 minutes  
were  acquired  (TR=1.15  seconds,  TE=30  ms, voxel  size=2  mm isotropic,  60 slices,  multiband=4,  echo  spacing  
0.57ms,  600 volumes)  to assess  functional  connectivity.  The subjects  were  instructed  to close  their eyes,  
remain  awake,  and not think  about  anything  in particular.  A field map scan  with identical  voxel  parameters  to 
the BOLD  acquisition  was also acquired  to allow  for correction  of geometric  distortion.  Processing  and 
Analysis :  FSL tools  were  used  to conduct  standard  preprocessing  steps,  including  skull removal,  distortion  
correction,  motion  correction,  and registration  to MNI space.  MELODIC  was applied  to each  dataset  to identify  
and remove  noise  components  using  fsl regfilt . To further  remove  confou nd due to transient  head  motion,  we 
utilized  the “scrubbing”  procedure  advocated  by [CONTACT_383945],41 computing  their frame -wise 
displacement (FD)  and derivative  variance  (DVARS)  metrics.  Volumes  with FD>0.5mm  and/or DV ARS>8  were  
excluded  from analysis  along  with the previous  volume  and the two following  volumes.  Two subjects  had more  
than 33% of volumes  removed  with “scrubbing”  and were  eliminated  from analyses.  There  was no significant  
difference  between  the number  of volumes  excluded  from remaining  OCD  subjects  (n = 15, mean  = 68.5,  SD = 
70.2)  and control  subjects  (n = 12, mean  = 60.5,  SD = 70.7)  (F = .16, p = 0.76).  Twelve  FreeSurfer  ROIs  from 
the FSTC  circuit,  implicated  in OCD,  were  selected  for further  investigatio n. Frontal  regions  included  bilateral  
OFC,  rostral  ACC,  and caudal  ACC.  Subcortical  ROIs  were  bilateral  caudate,  putamen,  and thalamus.  The 
mean  time series  within  each  ROI was computed  from the scrubbed  data and cross -correlated.  These  r values  
were  conve rted to z scores  using  the fisher  transformation.  The resulting  z scores  were  used  to investigate  
group  differences  in functional  connectivity  and in correlation  analyses  with measures  of OCD  severity  (CY- 
BOCS)  and impairment [Child  Obsessive -Compulsive I mpact Scale -Revised  (COIS -R)].43 
Results : There  were  no significant  differences  between  OCD  and control  groups  on IQ, age, gender,  SES,  
or ethnicity.  Adolescents  with OCD  showed  lower  functional  connectivity  compared  with controls on 19 of 22 
connectivity  comparisons  (11 per hemisphere)  within  FSTC.  Eleven  of 22 connectivity  comparisons  were  
significant  at p < .05 (Table  1). Cohen’s  d effect  sizes  for significant  group  differences  were  large  (0.82  to 
1.10).  Our results  are consistent  with findings  of Fitzgerald  et al.14 that show  significantly  lower  functional  
connectivity  between  ACC  and striatum  and between  ACC  and thalamus  in children  with OCD  compared  with 
controls.  Correlations  between  age and connectivity  measures  in the OCD  sample  were  not significant.  Using  
data from OCD  participants,  the CY-BOCS  (OCD  severity)  demonstrated  significant  negative  correlations  with 
10 of 11 connectivity  segments.  Parent  COIS -R and child COIS -R (OCD  functional  impairment)  showed  
significant negative  correlations  with 5 of 11 and 3 of 11 of the connectivity  measures, respectively.

HARDI : Acquisition : DI data were  collected  using  a novel  multi -band  EPI [INVESTIGATOR_383929].35,[ADDRESS_480429]  (128 volumes  with b=3000  and 9 volumes  with b=0, TR=2300ms,  TE=70ms,  2mm  
isotropic  voxel,  60 slices,  MB = 3, 5 minutes  each).  Preprocessing : Data  were  corrected  for eddy  currents  and 
the skull was removed.  FSL’s  topup  program  was used  to corre ct the DI for geometric  distortions.  The 
corrected  data were  then submitted  to FSL’s  bedpost  and probabilistic  tractography  was then conducted  
between  ROIs  using  FSL’s  probtractx.  
Results :  We demonstrate  rudimentary  examples  of tracking  within  FSTC  in one subject  in Figures  2-4. 
Refinements  to the tracking  procedure  are currently underway  prior to group  analyses.  
 
   
 
Pediatric  OCD  Dimensions  and Functional  Connectivity : We completed  an exploratory  factor  analysis  
(EFA)  of CY-BOCS  in 77 youths  with OCD  that revealed  4 OCD  dimensions  (58%  of variance):  
ordering/repeating,  contamination/cleaning,  hoarding,  and forbidden  thoughts.  Dimensional  structure  was 
similar  to previous  factor analyses  of CY-BOCS.44-[ADDRESS_480430],  adolescents  with OCD  
(n = 15) were  given  a score  on each  of [ADDRESS_480431]  strongly  on the 
given  dimension.  Significant  correlations  were  found  between  (1) ordering/repeating  dimension  scores  and 3 
OFC -subcortical  connections,  (2) hoarding  scores  and 3 rostral  ACC -subcorti cal connections,  and (3) 
forbidden  thoughts  scores  and [ADDRESS_480432].  
D. Approach:  The aims  of this protocol  are to examine  conne ctivity  in FSTC  using  R-fMRI  and HARDI  in 
medication -free adolescents  with OCD  in comparison  to controls  and to investigate  how sertraline  impacts  
FSTC  connectivity.  Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_383930].  Participants:  We will include  25 youth s 
(males  and females)  with OCD  ages  8-17 years  and 25 age- and gender -matched  healthy  controls  with 
no psychiatric  disorders  and without  a family  history  of OCD.  Inclusion  Criteria  for OCD  participants:  (1) OCD  
as the primary  DSM -IV diagnosis  based  on the Anxiety  Disorders  Interview  Schedule  (ADIS)  for DSM -IV, Child  
Version,48 and (2)  CY-BOCS49   score  of greater  than 15.  Exclusion   Criteria :  (1)  lifetime   diagnosis   of 
bipolar  disorde r, schizophrenia,  or substance  abuse/dependence  on ADIS,  (2) IQ < 80 on Wechsler  
Abbreviated Scales  of Intelligence  (WASI),50 (3) positive  urine  drug screen,  (4) MRI-incompatible  features  (e.g.,  
metal  implants,  claustrophobia ), (5) current  or recent  trial of psychotropic  medication  (within  the past [ADDRESS_480433] 6 weeks  for fluoxetine),  (6) non-response  in > 2 SSRI  trials  of adequate  dose/duration,  (7) 
positive  pregnancy  test, (8) history  of seizure  disorder  or serious  head  injury.  Rationale  for 
Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria:  OCD  participants  will have  CY-BOCS  score  above  [ADDRESS_480434]  mode rate or severe  OCD.  While  I originally  suggested  excluding  MDD  and 
ADHD  due to connectivity  differences  in youth  with MDD  and ADHD  that might  confound  the differences  due 
to OCD,  these  comorbidities  are so common  that it is extremely  difficult  to find subjects with “pure”  OCD.  
A more  heterogeneous  sample  with respect  to comorbidity  will be more  generalizable  to all youth  with OCD.  
Further, recently  published  neuroimaging  studies  of youth  with OCD have  not excluded  participants  with lifetime 
MDD,  ADHD,  or autism (e.g.,  Weber  AM, Soreni  N, & Noseworthy  MD, 2014,  Progress  in Neuro -
Psychopharmacology  & Biological  Psychiatry , 53:129 -136).  I plan to include  participants  with lifetime  
diagnoses  of ADHD,  MDD,  and autism/pervasive  developmental  disorder.  
Recruitment:  For our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  we scanned  30 teenagers  (17 OCD  and 13 controls)  in [ADDRESS_480435]  could  not complete  the scan  and 2 were  excluded  due to 
excessive  motion  artifacts41 (10%  excluded).  In addition,  we will factor  in an attrition  rate of 10% during  
sertraline  treatment.  Therefore,  to have  [ADDRESS_480436]. Bernstein’s  Child  and Adolescent  Anxiety  Disorders  Clinic

that has evaluated  and treated  over [ADDRESS_480437] OCD.   Approximately  50% of new cases  with OCD  are medication -free.  Therefore,  approximately  
1 case  per month  or 12 new cases  per year are diagnosed  with OCD  and are medication -free. To meet  our 
necessary  enrollment  of 1-2 OCD  cases  per month,  we will e-mail recruitment  information  to several  hundred  
mental  health  providers  and pediatricians  in the Minneapolis/St.  Paul metropolitan  area.  We will also use local 
newspapers,  Craig’s  List, and Facebook  which  were  successful  methods  of recruitment  in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
Additional  participants  will be recruited  via posters  in the community  and in clinics.  To facilitate  enrollment  of 
minorities,  we will actively  recruit  from Northpoint  Clinic  and Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383931].   See letters  of support.  
Procedure:  After  written  informed  consent  and assent  are obtained,  a 2-3 hour diagnostic  assessment  
Including  Interviews  and rating  scales  as described  in the Assessment Instruments  section  will be administered  
by a trained  interviewer  with a master’s  degree  or above.  Participants  meeting  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  
based  on diagnostic  assessment  will undergo  neuroimaging  at the CMRR  within  the following  week.  
Assessment  instruments  and neuroimaging  will be obtaine d at baseline  and 12 weeks  later in all participants  
(OCD  and controls) . Families  will be offered  $30 for completion  of the diagnostic  assessment  and $45 for 
imaging  studies  at baseline  and again  at 12 weeks.  Before  the scans,  participants  will (1) provide  a urine  
sample  for drug screening  and (for females  who have  begun  their menstrual  periods ) pregnancy  testing;  and 
(2) complete  a screening  questionnaire  to ensure  MRI safety  (e.g.,  to exclude  subjects  with metal  implants).  
After  baseline  assessment  and scans, OCD participants  will receive  12 weeks  of treatment  with sertraline.  See 
Medication  Management section.  
Assessment  Instruments:  (1) ADIS , semistructured  interview,  will confirm  OCD  diagnosis  and define  
comorbid  diagnoses.  Psychometric  propert ies are good  to excellent .51-53 (2) CY-BOCS  and CY-BOCS  
Checklist , clinician -rated  semistructured  instrument  to assess  types  and severity  of obsessions  and 
compulsions.  Psychometric  properties  are satisfactory.17,54 (3) Tic Questionnaire , assesses  the presence  and 
severity  of motor  and vocal  tics. (4) CDI-II, evaluates  depressive  symptoms  in children  and self-report  
scale  to document  severity  of depression  symptoms . (5)  Tanner  Staging  will be obtained  for participants  
using  drawings  of Tanner  pubertal  stages .56,57 (6) COIS -R43 measures  functional  impairment  due to OCD  and 
has good  psychometric  properties.43 (7) WASI  provides  an abbreviated  measure  of cognitive  functioning  to 
ensure  participants  have  IQs > 79. (8) Family  Interview  for Genetic  Studies  (FIGS)58 documen ts family  
history  of OCD.  (9) MASC -II, assesses  the presence  of symptoms  related  to anxiety  disorders  in youth  aged  
8 to 19 years.  (10) Side Effects  Checklist  will be completed  at medication  management  appointments.   (11) 
Services  Questionnaire  will be completed  at the final assessment  in order  to assess  the presence  of any 
therapy  or medications  sought  by [CONTACT_383946].  
Washout  Period  for Participants  on Psychiatric  Medications:  For participants  on psychiatric  
medications  for OCD  (SSRI  or clomipramine)  who have  not had an adequate  response  to treatment  (i.e., CY- 
BOCS  score  of greater  than 15), [CONTACT_130857]  will recommend  a safe schedule  to gradually  lower  the 
medication  dose  and then stop it. The washout  period  (no medic ation)  will be [ADDRESS_480438]  psychiatric  
medications  and 6 weeks  for fluoxetine.  During  the period  of lowering  and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_383932],  
there  is a potential  risk of discontinuation  symptoms  (for example,  headaches  or flu-like symptoms)  which  
should  be prevented  by [CONTACT_383947].  There  is also a risk of OCD  symptoms  
worsening  during  the washout.  If this occurs,  [CONTACT_130857]  may recommend  withdrawal  from the study  and re- 
starting  the original  psychiatric  medication.  
Medication  Management:  After  baseline  assessment  and scans , OCD  participants  will receive  sertraline  
which  will be titrated  using  a flexible  dosing  schedule  and individualized  based  on maximizing  efficacy  and 
minimizing  side effects.  As in POTS,  we will aim to achieve  target  dose  by [CONTACT_5875]  6 of the 12-week  trial. Target  
dose  will be 100-200 mg/day,  based  on age and weight  of the participant,  given  as a single  dose.  Sessions  
will be [ADDRESS_480439],  and safety  evaluation.  Human  Subjects section  includes  discussion  of potential  side effects  and their 
management.  Compliance  will be monitored  with pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685] . Sertraline  level will be obtained  at week  12 to 
further  document  compliance  with taking  sertraline.  Independent  evaluators  (blind  to study  hypotheses)  will 
obtain  the CY-BOCS  with parent  and teenager  together  at baseline,  week  6, and week  12. 
No concurrent  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (e.g.,  CBT,  family  therapy)  are permitted  during  medication  trial. At the end of [ADDRESS_480440]. Bernstein’s  Anxiety  Clinic  or see 
another physician  (we will provide  a referral  letter),  or taper  off the medication.  Non- or partial -responders  can 
be referred  to the Anxiety  Clinic  for CBT and/or crosstaper to another  SSRI  or clomipramine.  
Neuroimaging  Data  Acquisition  and Procedures:   MRIs  will be obtained  at baseline  and 12 weeks  later 
in all participants  (OCD  and controls).  The MRIs  will take place  at the CMRR  using  a standard  Siemens  3T 
TIM Trio because  the Human  Connectome  scanner  (used  for pi[INVESTIGATOR_222377])  has moved  to Washington  
University.  The HCP multi -band  fMRI  and DI sequences  are available  for the TIM; fMRI  and HARDI  data 
acquisition  for this new study  will use the multiband  sequence,35,[ADDRESS_480441]  recently  been  
developed  in CMRR  for the HCP.  The major  advantage  of the new sequences  includes  substantially  
accelerating  whole  brain  image  acquisition  times.   For fMRI  acquisitions,  TRs for comparable  acquisitions  are 
1.24 seconds  for the Trio, 1.15 seconds  for the Human  Connectome  Scanner,  and 4 seconds  for the Trio 
without  multi -band  acquisition.  We are currently  running  subjects  using  these  modified  sequences  (i.e., Cullen  
1R21  MH094558)  and obtaining  excellent  quality  data of similar  caliber  to the HCP  study and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299].  
To ease  anxiety,  participants  will have  the option  of practicing  in the mock  scanner,  will be able to 
communicate  with staff between  acquisition  periods,  and will listen  to music  during  parts  of the scan.  
First,  a high-resolution  structural  image  will be collected  (parameters  as in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46476]).  These  data will be 
processed  using  FreeSurfer  to yield ROIs  within  FSTC.  A field map will be collected  to correct  for geometric  
distortions  in the fMRI  scans.   R-fMRI :  Subjects  will be instructed  to keep  eyes open  instead  of closed,  which  
is becoming  more  standard  in the field.  EPI [INVESTIGATOR_383933]=1.32  
seconds,  multiband  factor=4,  voxel  size=2  mm isotropic  resolution,  TE=30  ms, 64 contiguous  AC-PC aligned  
axial slices  (12 minutes).  Such  dramatic  reduction  of TR in comparison  to standard  TRs (4 sec) can 
substantially  improve  statistical  significance  of resting  networks.35 HARDI : Diffusion  encoding  will  be 
performed  along 128 non-collinear  directions  (single  shell)  with single  shot EPI, multiband  factor=3,  
TR=3800ms,  TE=90ms,  2 mm isotropic  resolution,  106 matrix,  212mm  FOV,  66 contiguous  slices,  b 
value=3000,  total acquisition  time 9 min per scan  (one PE left-to-right and one PE right-to-left). The number of 
directions  and the high b value  here are optimal  for enhancing  the capacity  for resolution  of crossing  fibers.  In 
addition,  during  part of the scan,  the participant  will be asked  to complete  a task.   The participant  will be shown  
a set of three  numbers  on a projector,  and be asked  to press  one of three  buttons  depending  on the numbers  
he or she sees.  This scan will provide  information  about  areas  of the brain  that are activated  in OCD  versus  
control  participants  during  the task.  
If the quality  of the baseline  or 12-week  scan  is poor due to motion  artifacts  from small  head  movements,  
the participant  and his/her  parents  will be asked  to consider  returning  for a repeat  scan.  This is optional.  
Imaging  Data  Analysis:  Specifi c Aim #1:  Functional  and Structural  Connectivity  Analysis :  The objective  
of the neuroimaging  data analysis  is to test the hypothesis  that youth  with OCD  have  abnormal  functional  and 
structural  connectivity  within  FSTC.  Functional  Connectivity : First,  pre-processing  steps  will be conducted  as 
described  in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46476],  to remove  effects  due to physiological  noise  and motion  and to correct  for geometric  
distortions.  Freesurfer  seed  regions  (medial  OFC,  rostral  ACC,  caudal  ACC,  caudate,  putamen,  and thalamus)  
will be aligned  to the fMRI  data.  Mean  time series  for spontaneous  fluctuations  in BOLD  signal  of ROI will be 
calculated,  correlations  will be determined  between  these  time series,  and correlation  values  will be normalized  
using  an r-z transformation.  Norm alized  values  are then used  for group  comparison  using  age as a covariate.  
Analysis  of covariance  (ANCOVA)  will be applied  to the data.  Correlations  will be calculated  to examine  the 
relations  between  functional  connectivity  in FSTC  and severity  on CY-BOCS .  Structural  Connectivity : The 
structural  connectivity  analysis  will be designed  to supplement  the functional  connectivity  analysis  by 
[CONTACT_383948].  The same  Freesurfer  ROIs  as above  will be aligned  to the data.  Following  
the method s of Lenglet  and colleagues60 at UMN  who have  mapped  human  basal  ganglia  and thalamic  
connectome  in healthy  adults,  we will delineate  FSTC  tracts  in all participants  with FSL software.  We will first 
estimate  fiber orientation s with a maximum  number  of 3 crossing  fibers  using  bedpostx  and then probabilistic  
tractography  (probtrackx)  will be used  to estimate  the connectivity  distribution  of pathways  within  FSTC.  We 
will then use connectivity  measures  (i.e., FA, mean  diffusivity,  and radial  diffusivity  within  tracts,  and number  of 
samples  passing  from seed  to target) to examine  effects  of group,  accounting  for the size of the seed  region  for 
each  individual.  ANCOVA  will be applied  to the baseline  connectivity  data to test the main  effect  of group  
using  age as a covariate.  Correlation  coefficients  will be calculated  to examine  the  relations   between  
functional  and structural  connectivity.  Relations  between  OCD  dimensions  and functional  connectivity  will also 
be explored  using  correlations.  Specific  Aim #2: Effects  of Sertraline  on Connectivity:  Change  in connectivity  
data from baseline  to [ADDRESS_480442]  and covariate  effects  of age. Group  differences  in connectivity  at 12 weeks  will be examined  
using  t- tests.  An OCD  responder  will be defined  as a participant  with a decrease  of 35% in total CY-BOCS  
score from baseline  to 12 weeks  because  the average  decrease  in OCD  symptoms  with SSRI  treatment  is 30- 
40%.[ADDRESS_480443]  to explore  how change  over time differs  between  these  groups.  Finally,  baseline  
connectivity  differences  will be compared  between  OCD  responders  and non-responders  using  t-tests  and chi- 
square  tests  to explore  connectivity  differences  that are associated  with response  to sertraline  in youth  with 
OCD  (i.e. response  predictors).  
Power  Analyses/Sample  Size:   Specific  Aim #1:  The study  design  is powered  to accomplish  Specific  Aim 
#1. (a) Functional  Connectivity : Pi[INVESTIGATOR_26923] [ADDRESS_480444]  sizes  for significant  group  differences  between  OCD  and 
controls  ranged  from 0.82 and 1.10 (Table  1). Thus,  the effect  size of 0.82 can be considered  a conservative  
estimate  or “upper  bound”  of sample  size needed,  while  the effect  size of 1.10 can be considered  a “lower  
bound”  estimate  of sample  size needed.  For the upper  bound  estimate,  a sample  size of n = [ADDRESS_480445]  significant  group  differences  with power  of 80% at alpha  = .05. Using  the lower  bound  
estimate,  we would  require  a sample  size of n = [ADDRESS_480446]  significant  group  differences  with power  
of 80% at alpha  =.05.  (b) Structural  Connectivity : Feasibility  of finding  significant  group  differences  in 
structural  connectivity  with the proposed  sample  size is based  on a study  with smaller  sample  size (14 
depressed  adolescents  and 14 healthy  controls).61,[ADDRESS_480447]  (tract  connecting  sgACC  to amygdala)  (p = 0.03,  effect  size d = 0.89),  standard  error  of difference  = 
0.[ZIP_CODE].  Based  on this, minimum  difference  required  to show  a difference  in FA for the OCD  sample  using  a 
similar  approach  (tractography  to delineate  a desired  tract and measuring  FA) would  be at least  0.[ADDRESS_480448]  power  of 80% to detect  a group  difference  at 
alpha  =0.05.  Specific  Aim #2 (Exploratory)  will generate  data (means,  SDs and test statistics)  that will inform  
effect  sizes  to calculate  power  and sample  size for a R01 study.  In the larger  trial, impact  of sertraline  
treatment  on the abnormalities  in functional  and structural  connectivity  will be formally  tested  in youths  with 
OCD.  
Risks  to Human  Subjects:

Sources  of Research  Materials:  
 
Research  materials  obtained  from human  participants  include  clinical  interviews  and rating  scales.  In addition,  
neuroimaging  studies  (HARDI  and fMRI)  will be obtained.  These  materials  will be collected  for the purposes  of 
the research  study.  
 
Potential  Risks:  
 
Potential  risks of participating  in the study  include:  
 
1. Issues  related  to confidentiality.  
2. Gathering  of sensitive  information  during  interviews  and on rating  scales.  
3. Anxiety  about  having  MRI scans.  
4. Sertraline  side effects.  
 
SSRIs  are the pharmacological  treatment  of choice  for pediatric  OCD.[ADDRESS_480450]  
medication  treatment  for OCD  in children  and adolescents.  Sertraline,  an SSRI,  is generally  well tolerated ,; 
however,  side effects  can occur.  Potential  side effects  of sertraline  include  stom achaches,  insomnia,  
headaches,  and sexual  side effects.  In addition,  there  are psychiatric  side effects  including  motor  activation,  
suicidal  ideation/suicidal  behaviors,  and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_383934].  All antidepressant  (including  
sertraline)  have  an FDA black  box warning  for children,  adolescents,  and young  adults.   The black  box warning  
is for the rare possibility  of suicidal  ideation  or suicidal  behavior  while  on an antidepressant.  This is based  on a 
meta -analysis  of 24 short -term,  placebo -control led randomized  trials  of antidepressants  for treatment  of 
pediatric  anxiety  disorders  (including  OCD)  or depressive  disorders.  The meta -analysis  included  >4,500  
children  and adolescents  and showed  a 2% risk of suicidal  ideation  or behavior  on placebo  and 4% on 
antidepressant s.[ADDRESS_480451]  Risks:  
 
Recruitment  Methods  and Informed  Consent:  
 
Recruitment  of participants  with OCD  will be through  the Princip al Investigator’s  Child  and Adolescent  Anxiety  
Disorders  Clinic  at the University  of Minnesota  Medical  School.  [CONTACT_130857]  and her colleagues  have  
evaluated  and treated  over [ADDRESS_480452]  e-mail and addres s lists for several  hundred  pediatricians  and mental  health  providers  in 
the Minneapolis/St.  Paul metropolitan  area that will be used  for recruiting  children  with OCD.  Families  with a 
child with OCD  and healthy  controls  will also be recruited  through  flyers on bulletin  boards  in the community  
and in clinics,  radio  advertisements,  and advertisements  in newspapers.  In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  we used  
advertising  in Facebook  which  was an effective  method  of recruiting.  A description  of the study  will be posted  
on the OCD  Twin  Cities  Chapter  and International  OCD websites.  
 
If the potential  participant  is being  seen  in the Child  and Adolescent  Anxiety  Disorders  Clinic,  the parents  and 
child will be asked  if they would  be interested  in being  included  in the study  at the conclusion  of their Clinic  
visit. Documentation  will be presented  at that time,  and parents  will have  time to ask any questions  about  the 
proposed  study.  Parents  will be encouraged  to take documentation  materials  with them  to consider  their 
child's  partic ipation,  and will be allowed  to bring  back  or mail back the signed  documentation.  If the potential  
participant  is a healthy  adolescent,  interested  parents  will be asked  to contact  [CONTACT_383949],  or via flyers posted  on bulletin  boards.  
 
Written  informed  consent  from parents  and written  informed  assent  from adolescents  will be obtained.  Gail 
Bernstein,  MD, PI, Kathryn  Cullen,  MD, Co-I, and Alexandra  Zagoloff,  Ph.D.,  Co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_383935].  The project  coordinator  will also be obtaining  informed  
consent  after undergoing  training  from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_383936].  
 
Protections  Against  Risk:  
 
1. Issues  Related  to Confidentiality : All study  staff will complete  the U of MN HIPAA  training.  All data will 
be identified  with subject  number  and will be stored  in locked  file cabinets  with access  only to designated  
study  personnel.  Other  than research  staff directly  interfacing  with participants  (e.g.,  indepen dent 
evaluators),  only PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-I will have  access  to subject  data and subject  identities.  This approach  is 
very likely  to be effective  in achieving  protection  of confidentiality.  
2. Gathering  of Sensitive  Information : The study  personnel  will be trained  to be sensitive  to the early  signs  
of distress,  to provide  support,  and to allow  the participant  the opportunity  to stop at any time should  
he/she  become  uncomfortable  or have  questions.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-I will always  be available  for consultation  
if necessary  and the subject  will be allowed  to withdraw  from the study  at any time.  
3. Anxiety  about  Scanning : The MRIs  will take place  at the CMRR,  where a mock  scanner is  available.  The 
mock  scanner  is a practice  scanner  that can be used  to prepare  the participants  for the MRI.  Participants  
who are anxious  about  the MRI will have  the option  of practicing  in the mock  scanner.  They  will be able 
to communicate  with the scanners  throughout  the scanning  session.  The participants  will have  the 
opportunity  to listen  to music  for relaxation  during  most  parts  of the scan.  In the event  that they are too 
uncomfortable  with the procedure, the subjects  will not be scanned.  
4. Sertraline  Side Effects : All participants  and their parents  will receive  psychoeducation  about  sertraline  
and the potential  risks and benefits.  They  will be encouraged  to ask questions  and will be engaged  in a 
dialogue  about  sertraline  and potential  risks and benefits.  Participants  will be seen  for [ADDRESS_480453]. Bernstein’s  Anxiety  Clinic  for medication  management  or with 
another  physician  (we will provide  a referral  letter),  or taper  off the medication.  Non- or  partial - 
responders  can be referred  to [CONTACT_130857]’s  Clinic  for CBT and/or  crosstaper  to another  SSRI  or 
clomipramine.  If the family  would  like to taper  off the medication,  [CONTACT_130857]  will supervise  a gradual  
taper  down  in order  to avoid  withdrawal  effects  and will monitor  for potential  recurrence  of OCD  
symptoms.  [CONTACT_130857]  has years  of experience  treating  children  and adolescents  with sertraline.  She 
teaches  and supervises  residents  and fellows  who are prescribing  this medication  in the Child  and 
Adolescent  Anxiety  Clinic  at the UMN.  
 
In order  to protect  against  risk of harm  to youths , several  steps  will be taken.  Consent  will be obtained  
from parent(s)  and assent  from adolescents.  Youths  and parents will be allowed  to discontinue  
participation  at any time.  We believe  that adequate  protections  against  risks are in place  as docum ented  
earlier in  this section.  
 
Potential  Benefits  of the Proposed  Research  to Human  Subjects  and Others:  
 
The results  of the psychiatric  interviews  and rating  scales  can be shared  with families.  This information  could  
be beneficial  in the care of childre n and adolescents  with OCD.  The findings  will advance  knowledge  in the 
area of neuroimaging  for pediatric  OCD . In addition,  the study  will contribute  to the knowledge  about  
underlying  mechanisms  of obsessions  and compulsions  and site of action  of SSRIs.  
 
Participants  with OCD  will receive  [ADDRESS_480454].  Potential  benefits  include  relief  of OCD  
symptoms  from the sertraline.  
 
 
Importance  of Knowledge  to be Gained:  
 
If our proposed  model  of dysfunction  in FSTC  is supported  by [CONTACT_383950],  this will represent  an 
important  step in the effort  to understand  the neurobiology  of pediatric  OCD.  We hope  to delineate  specific  
neural  changes  that underline  response  to sertraline.  The findings  of this study  will inform  future  studies  about  
the neurobiology  of OCD  and treatment  response  to SSRI  medications.  This study  will yield information  
regarding  the connectivi ty in the FSTC  related  to OCD  and will move  the field closer  to understanding  the 
etiology  of pediatric  OCD.  
 
 
 
 
 
Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Plan:  
Data  and safety  monitoring  will take place  continuously  throughout  the course  of the study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_383937]  (but are not 
limited  to) supervising  all recruitment  efforts;  evaluating  risks versus  benefits  for participants;  and monitoring  
the quality,  validity,  and reliability  of data gathered.  Some  data monitoring  efforts  will be delegated  to research  
staff;  however,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_383938].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_383939]  (Andrew  Barnes,  M.D.,  
Department  of Pediatrics,  and Suma  Jacob,  M.D.,  Ph.D.,  Department  of Psychiatry)  uninvolved  with the 
present  study  to serve  on a Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board.  The Board  will review  the data and safety  of 
the study approximately  once  per year.  
 
All data collected  will remain  confidential  and will be in file folders  which  will be stored  in locked  file cabinets  in 
a locked  room.  File folders  will contain  only subject  identification  numbers.  Only the PI, [CONTACT_383951], Co-I, and 
Project  Coordinator  will have  access  to the master  file containing  names,  identification  numbers,  and 
addresses.  The master  file will be kept separate  from the data collection  instruments  and from the data file on 
the computer  system  protecte d by [CONTACT_101692].  Information  given  to persons  other  than project  personnel  will 
occur  only with written  parental  consent  and for the specific  purpose  documented  on the release  of information  
form.  The imaging  data will be completely  de-identified.  All imagin g data will be stored  in the CMRR  which  is 
highly  secure.   All processing  will be conducted  using  the Minnesota  Supercomputing  Institute  resources.  
 
Potential  Adverse  Events:  
 
The possibility  of the following  adverse  events  is low. We will monitor for:  
 
1. Suicidal  or homicidal  ideation  or behavior.  
2. Worsening  of clinical  condition  of children  with OCD  (i.e., symptoms  become  severe  so that assessment  
for possible  psychiatric  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_383940]).  
3. Suspected  child abuse.  
 
 
Protoc ols for Managing  Adverse  Events:  
 
Project  staff (including  project  coordinator  and independent  evaluators)  will be trained  by [CONTACT_6283]. Bernstein  and 
Cullen  about  how to assess  for suicidal  and homicidal  ideation,  how to identify  deterioration  of an adolescent’s  
clinical  condition,  and what clinical  situations  raise  concern  about  suspected  child abuse  or neglect:  
 
1. If a child is identified  as suicidal  or homicidal,  this will be reported  to [CONTACT_130857],  PI, or [CONTACT_383951],  
Co-I, who will evaluate  the patient  and provide  psychiatric  care as needed.  If suicidal  ideation  or 
suicidal  behavior  is determined  to be secondary  to sertraline,  the sertraline  will be discontinued  and 
psychiatric  care will be provided  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-I. If necessary,  the adolescent  will be referred to the 
Emergency  Room , or Behavioral  Evaluation  Center  at the University  of Minnesota  Medical  Center  – 
Fairview,  as deemed  appropriate,  based  on clinical  information.  If evaluation  results  in 
recommendation  for inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  this can be arranged  at the Child  and Adolescent  
Psychiatry  Inpatient  Unit at the University  of Minnesota  Medical  Center  – Fairview.  
 
2. If worsening  of clinical  condition  is  noted  by a research  staff member,  it will be reported  to [CONTACT_383952],  PI [INVESTIGATOR_48107]. Cullen,  Co-I. They  will provide  psychiatric  care as needed  and/or facilitate the child 
being  evaluated  in a local mental  health  clinic , the Emergency  Room , or Behavioral  Evaluation  Center  
at the University  of Minnesota  Medical  Center  – Fairview,  as deemed  appropriate,  based  on clinical  
information.  If the evaluator  recommends  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  admission  to the Child  and 
Adolescent  Psychiatric  Unit at the University  of Minnesota  Medical  Center  – Fairview  can be arranged.  
 
3. If child abuse  is suspected,  the research  staff member  will immediately  report  to [CONTACT_130857]  or [CONTACT_383953]  who will then assist the staff member in  reporting  to Child  Protection  and/or  police  immediately.  
Parents  will be given  office  phone  numbers  for the Project  Coordinator,  [CONTACT_130857]  and [CONTACT_383951]  to call 
during  office  hours  in case  any of the clinical  situations  described  above  occur  and they will be given  [CONTACT_383952]’s  cell phone  number  for after hours  and weekends.  
 
Reporting  Adverse  Events:  
 
All serious  adverse  events  (e.g.,  psychiatric  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  that occur  during  the study  will be reported  within  
[ADDRESS_480455] (IRB) at the University  of Minnesota.  Yearly  written  reports  
regarding  data and safety  monitoring  will be provided  to the University  of Minnesota  IRB and the NIMH  Project  
Officer.

Safety  Endpoint : 
• Incidence of AEs, SAEs, including incidence of 
injection site reactions, changes in vital signs, 
laboratory abnormalities . 
Immunogenicity Endpoint :  
• Incidence of anti -drug antibodies (ADA ) (binding 
and/or neutralizing) . 
Pharmacokinetic  Endpoint : 
• Drug concentrations at Weeks 0 ( Pre dose  and

28, 40 , and 52.  
• Pharmacokinetic parameters after the first  dose 
(maximum observed serum concentration [Cmax], 
time from dosing to maximum measured 
concentration [tmax], area under the 
concentration -time curve from Week 0 to Week 4 
[AUC w0-w4] and other PK parameter, as 
appropriate ). 
Abbreviations: AE = adverse eve nt; EMA = European Medicines Agency; EU  = European Union; 
PK = pharmacokinetic; SAE = Serious  Adverse Event; US FDA = [LOCATION_002]  Food and Drug Administration . 
Overall Design : 
This is a randomized, double -blind, multicentric, parallel group, and active controlled study  comparing 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of SC administration of DMB -3115 and EU sourced Stelara in patient s 
with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis . 
After a screening period of up to 4 weeks, the eligible patient s will be randomly assigned in a 1:1  ratio to 
receive treatment with either DMB -3115 or Stelara. Randomization will be stratified according to patient ’s 
body weight at baseline (≤100 kg or >100  kg), geographic region (EU, US or Rest of the World [ROW]) 
and the number of previous systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_109006] (<3 or ≥3).  
The study will have 2 periods . 
Period 1 : 
In the Period 1  (from Week 0 to Week 28), patient s will receive the assigned treatm ent (either DMB -3115 
or Stelara) at Weeks [ADDRESS_233034] Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI) 50 response by [CONTACT_10585]  12 will 
be discontinued from further treatment with ustekinumab (either DMB -3115 or Stelara).  
Period 2 : 
In the Period 2  (from Week 28 to Week 52), patient s randomized to receive DMB -3115 at the beginning of 
the study will continue to receive the same treatment up to Week 40 while patient s randomized to receive 
Stelara at the beginning of the study will be re -randomized  and re -stratified based on the body weight at 
Week  28 (≤100 kg or >100 kg)  at Week 28 in a 1:1 ratio to either continue on Stelara or will be transitioned 
to receive DMB -3115 every 12 weeks up to Week  40 (i.e., [ADDRESS_233035] [ IP] after re -
randomization). The doses at re -randomization (Week  28) for both DMB -3115 and Stelara would  be 
re-assigned based on the body weight at Week  28 (≤100 kg or >100 kg) . Patients receiving DMB -[ADDRESS_233036]  PASI  75 response at Week  28 will be eligible for inclusion into 
the Period 2  of the study (Transition period : from Week  28 to Week  52). 
 
Patient s who do not achieve at least PASI 50 response by [CONTACT_10585] 12 or PASI 75 response by [CONTACT_10585]  28 will 
be discontinued from further treatment with ustekinumab . These patients will remain in the study and be 
followed up to Week  52 for safety monitoring, including immunogenicity. For safety monitoring and 
immunogenicity in non -responders the following should be completed at follow -up visits: physical 
examination, vital signs, hematology  and biochemistry laboratory tests, urine analysis, tuberculosis 
evaluation, anti-drug antibodies ( ADA) blood sampling, electrocardiogram, pregnancy testing, and adverse 
events (AEs).  All patients who discontinue treatment including non -responders as per Section 7.[ADDRESS_233037] an early termination  (ET) visit. E arly termination  visit will be performed within 
[ADDRESS_233038] IP administration.  
Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity assessments will be done periodically.  
Blood samples for PK and ADA assessments will be collected prior to IP administration (in case a dose is 
scheduled for the same visit).  
Safety will be evaluated through an assessment of AEs, vital  signs, electrocardiograms , and 
immunogenicity, along with clinical laboratory testing.  
The patient s will visit the clinical site for screening and then at baseline (Week 0 /Day  1), Week  0/Day  2, 
Week  1, Week 2, Week  4, and then every [ADDRESS_233039] visit at Week 52 will be End of Study (EOS) visit. 
There are total 1 2 scheduled visits planned, including the screening an d EOS visit.  
An Interim Analysis will be performed when all active patients complete the Week 28 assessment visit. 
The efficacy endpoints up to Week 28 and all available safety, ADA and PK data will be analyzed and an 
interim clinical study report will be generated for submission to the regulatory agencies.  
Number of Investigators and Study Sites : 
Approximately 124 Investigators and sites are expected to participate in this study.  
Number of Patient s: 
Assuming a dropout rate of 20% in Period 1, 15% in Period 2, and considering the 1:1 re -randomization 
rate for Stelara arm in Period 2 and to meet the  minimum requirement of safety analysis by [CONTACT_196257] ( EMA ) (N=100), 590 patients (a minimum of 400 complete d patients) will be necessary 
in total.  
Thus, 590 patients (295 patients per treatment group  at baseline ) will be enrolled . 
Treatment Groups  and Duration : 
Two treatment groups (DMB -3115, and Stelara) in Period 1  and 3 treatment groups (DMB -3115, Stelara, 
and Stelara switched to DMB -3115) for Period 2 . 
Patient s who weigh ≤100 kg will receive an initial dose of 45 mg ustekinumab administered subcutaneously 
(either DMB -3115 or Stelara as assigned), followed by [CONTACT_20904] 45 mg dose 4 weeks la ter, and then every 
12 weeks thereafter (up to 40 weeks after randomization). Patient s who weigh >100 kg will receive 90  mg 
doses as per same schedule.  
The doses at re -randomization (Week 28) would be assigned on the body weight at that time.  
The total dur ation of patient  participation in the study will be up to 56  weeks .

Statistical methods:  
All data listings, summaries, and analyses will be performed under the guidance and approval of the 
Sponsor.  
Descriptive statistics will be used for all variables, as appropriate. Continuous variables will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_46932], mean, standard deviation  (SD) , median, minimum, and maximum. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_196258]. U nless 
otherwise stated, percentages will be calculated out of the total population for each treatment group . 
Primary Efficacy Analysis (for E uropean Medicines Agency  [EMA] ) 
• Percent change in PASI at Week 8 will be analy zed with a 95% confidence interval ( CI) for the 
difference in means using estimates from an Analysis of Covariance ( ANCOVA ) model adjusted for 
baseline PASI score and the stratification factors ( patient ’s body weight at baseline [≤100 kg, or 
>100  kg], geographic region [EU, US or ROW] and the  number of previous systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_196254] [<3 or ≥3 ]). 
• Equivalence between the 2 treatment groups will be declared if the 95% CI of the mean difference is 
entirely contained within the pre -specified equivalence margin of (-15%, 15% ).  
• Analysis will be performed in the Intent -to-Treat ( ITT) and Per Protocol Set ( PPS). The PPS is the 
primary efficacy analysis population.  
• Missing values for primary efficacy variable in the ITT set will be imputed by [CONTACT_111012] 
(MI) method.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis (for U nited States  Food and Drug Administration [ US FDA])  
• Percent change in PASI at  Week 12 will be analy zed with a 90% CI for the difference in means using 
estimates from an ANCOVA model adjusted for baseline PASI score and the stratification factors 
(patient’s body weight at baseline [≤100 kg, or >100  kg], geographic region [EU, US, or ROW] and 
the number of previous systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_109006] [<3 or ≥3]).  
• Equivalence between the 2 treatment groups will be declared if the 90% CI of the mean difference is 
entirely contained within the pre -specified equivalence margin of ( -10%, 10 %).  
• Analysis will be performed in the ITT and PPS. The ITT is the primary efficacy analysis population.  
• Missing values for primary efficacy variable in ITT set will be imputed by [CONTACT_196259].  
Sensitivity Analysis  
Percent change in PASI will be analy zed for each PPS and ITT set (EMA and US FDA) using a mixed 
linear model with treatment group, baseline  body weight  (≤100  kg, or >100  kg), geographic region (EU, 
US or ROW ), the number of previous systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_109006] (<3 or ≥3), visit, and the 
treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline PASI score as a covariate. The treatment mean 
difference at Week 8 (for EMA ) and Week  12 (for US FDA), along with CI are calculated. The 
variance -covariance matrix of unstructured form is used to model the correlation within each patient . 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Endpoints based on proportions will be analyzed using a  logistic regression test with the baseline value, 
baseline body weight (≤100 kg , or >100 kg), geographic region (EU, US or ROW ), and the number of

Supp ortive Analysis  to Secondary Endpoint for Period 2  
Percentage  change in PASI score from baseline to Week s 40 and 52 will be analyzed using ANCOVA with 
Welch’s test with baseline PASI score, body weight (≤100  kg, or >100 kg), geographic region (EU, US, or 
ROW), and the number of previous systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_109006] (<3 or ≥3) as covariates . 
Safety Analysis  
The number and proportion of patient s experiencing AEs and Serious Adverse Events  will be tabulated and 
compared by [CONTACT_1570]. Adverse events will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
Vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters being monitored for safety will be summarized by [CONTACT_196260], mean, SD, minimum, 
median, and maximum. Data listings of clinically significant abnormalities/outliers will be presented.  
Immunogenicity Analyses   
The incidence of ADAs an d neutrali zing antibodies will be summari zed by [CONTACT_196261].  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Pharmacokinetic data will be summarized descriptively.  Pharmacokinetic parameters after the first dose 
(e.g., Cmax, tmax, area under the concent ration -time curve from Week 0 to Week 4 [AUC w0-w4] and other PK 
parameters, as appropriate) will be determined using an appropriate analysis methodology.  
Additional details about the statistical methods including, but not limited, analysis sets, missing da ta 
strategies, etc. will be provided in the body of the protocol and the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which 
will be prepared as a separate document prior to database lock.  
Statistical Hypotheses  
Statistical hypotheses and testing utilized will be defined in the SAP, including the null and alternative 
hypotheses. Primary and secondary endpoint analyses will be included in the SAP . 
Sample Size Determination  
The sample size required for the primary endpoint has been calculated based on the following a ssumptions; 
two-sided alpha of 0.05 (for EMA) or 0.10 (for US FDA), power of 90%, the difference between Stelara 
and DMB -3115 is 0, and the SD is 0.3. One to one (1:1) randomization rate of Period 1 is assumed. 
Equivalence margins of 1 5% and 1 0% were recom mended by [CONTACT_196262] , respectively. The SD 
assumption was derived from the observed SD of the mean improvement in PASI score in studies 
PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2 . Sample size was calculated using the Two one -sided t -tests (TOST) 
procedure as implemen ted in the R package power TOST. The overall sample size will be based on the 
larger sample size calculated through EMA and US FDA ’s recommendation.

As shown in above table, for primary efficacy analysis, the US FDA sample size of 490 patients in total 
(245 patients per treatment group at baseline) is selected to achieve [ADDRESS_233042] a 90%  CI 
for the difference in pri mary endpoint fall entirely within the 10% equivalence margin with more than 
90% power.  
On the other hand, for safety analysis, a minimum of 400 completed patients (at least 100 patients per 
treatment group for long -term data) will be necessary to meet th e minimum requirement by [CONTACT_196263] 1:1 re -randomization for Stelara arm. To achieve 400 completed patients, 590  patients 
(295 patients per treatment group at baseline) need to be enrolled assuming both dropout rate of 20% in 
Period 1 and 15% in Perio d 2. 
The total number of patients needed for the safety analysis is larger than that needed for the primary efficacy 
analysis. Thus, 590 patients (295 patients per treatment group) in total need to be enrolled (randomized).  
Populations for Analyses  
For the purpose of analysis, the analysis sets are defined.  
• Intent -to-Treat set: All patient s who have been randomized.  
• Per protocol set (for EMA): Patient s who complete the study up to Week [ADDRESS_233043] no major protocol 
deviations. All decisions to exclu de the patient s from the per  protocol population dataset will be made 
prior to the unblinding of the study.  
• Per protocol set (for US FDA): Patients who complete the study up to Week [ADDRESS_233044] no major 
protocol deviations. All decisions to exclude patien ts from the per  protocol population dataset will be 
made prior to the unblinding of the study.  
• Safety set: Patient s who randomize and receive at least 1 dose of the IP. The safety analysis will be 
conducted according to the treatment that a patient  actual ly receives.  
• PK analysis set: Patient s who receive at least [ADDRESS_233045] no major protocol deviations /events  that may 
significantly affect the PK assessment.  
 
Data Monitoring Committee:  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be constituted by [CONTACT_196264]. The DSMB will include physicians with relevant clinical expertise, none of  
CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol DMB -3115 -2 - Protocol Amendment  01 
 18 
whom is affiliat ed with the Sponsor. The DSMB will operate as per a written charter. The DSMB would 
periodically examine the safety data emerging from the study and provide its recommendations to the 
Sponsor. Based on its review, the DSMB may advise for the study to be co ntinued as is, or for the protocol 
to be modified, or for the study to be terminated.

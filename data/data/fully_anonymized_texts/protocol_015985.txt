Objectives 
Primary Objective:  
 
To demonstrate the effects of dopaminergic activation on the autonomic nervous system  in 
subjects  with type 2 diabetes.  
 
Secondary Objective:   
 
To demonstrate the effects of dopaminergic activation with b romocriptine- QR on the regulation of 
hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -axis (HPA) hormones  and on the plasma levels  of markers of  inflammation 
and oxidative/nitrosative stress  in type 2 diabetes  subjects . The study  will evaluate treatment  
effects on inflammatory markers, the l eptin/ adiponectin system, and hormonal levels of renin-
angiotensin system (RAS), aldosterone and c ortisol. A co-secondary objective of the study will be 
to assess the impact of bromocriptine- QR vs placebo on measures of insulin resistance and 
glycemic control (e.g., OGTT glucose and insulin, Matsuda index, HOMA -IR, HbA1c).  
 
The treatment effects on all  of the above primary and secondary outcomes will also be assessed 
as a function of the duration of diabetes and other baseline demographics such as HbA1c, 
concomitant medications and metabolic status.

    Study Design 
This is a  single -site, prospective,  interventional, twenty -four week, randomized, double blind, 
placebo- controlled trial with bromocriptine QR in subjects  with early diabetes  and established 
T2DM to evaluate its effects on the cardiovascular and peripheral autonomic nervous system, as 
well as inflammatory markers, the leptin/adiponectin system, hormonal levels of RAS and HPA 
axis, indices of insulin resistance and glycemic control , and measures of oxidative and nitrosative 
stress. At least twenty (20)  but no more than forty (40) early  diabetes subjects  and at least forty 
(40) but no more than sixty (60) subjects  with established diabetes will be enrolled in the study.  
Entry criteria will be chec ked at the screening visit. Subjects  will be required to be on a stable 
anti-diabetes regimen cons isting of  diet and/or oral anti -diabetic agents consisting of metformin 
alone or metformin plus an insulin secretion enhancer (sulfonylurea, DPP4 Inhibitors, or GLP -1 
analogs) for at least 60 days prior to randomization. Following a 2 week lead- in period,  subjects  
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive UDT (usual diabetes therapy) plus bromocriptine- QR 
or UDT plus placebo. The circadian timing of the interventional therapy will be within 2 hours of 
waking in the morning.  
Following randomization, sub jects will be titrated to the maximum tolerated dose of the study 
drug (bromocriptine -QR or placebo)  over a 4 week period.   
Subjects will return at 4 weeks after randomization, at 12 weeks after randomization, and then at 
study end (week 24 or early termination)  for analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints . A 
primary analysis of the study data will be performed after [ADDRESS_572477] any adverse events that occurred after cessation.  
All visits will be conducted at The Strelitz Diabetes Center, Norfolk, VA.  
 
 
Number Of Subjects  
Planned enrollment ; A total of [ADDRESS_572478] 20 but 
no more than 40 early  (diabetes duration of  < 4 years ) diabetes subjects  and at least 40 but no 
more than 60 subjects  with established diabetes  (diabetes duration of ≥ 4 years) will be enrolled 
in the study .  
 
Primary Subject Characteristics at Enrollment  
T2DM male or female subjects between the ages of 30 and 80 years  with HbA1c ≤ 10% on a 
stable anti -diabetes regimen of diet and/or metformin alone therapy or metformin plus an insulin 
secretion enhancer (sulfonylureas, DPP4 Inhibitors, GLP -1 analogs) therapy for a [ADDRESS_572479] a documented C -peptide level of >2 ng/ml from the 
screening  visit.  
 
Study Treatments 
Bromocriptine- QR, 0.8 mg/day, with the dose increased by 0.8 mg/day every week to a maximum 
of 3.2 mg/day, or as tolerated to a minimum dose of 1.6  mg/day, or matching placebo, added on 
to usual diabetes  therapy  consisting of a stable anti -diabetes regimen of diet and/or metformin

GLP-1 analogs) therapy for a [ADDRESS_572480] of bromocriptine -QR vs placebo on changes in autonomic 
function measured by [CONTACT_449320],  including power spectral analysis of heart rate as well as 
peripheral autonomic function using sudorimetry and l aser scanning of peripheral microvascular 
autonomic control.  
 
Secondary endpoints will be bromocriptine- QR vs placebo effects on inflammatory m arkers, 
markers of oxidative/nit rosative stress, the leptin/ adiponectin system, and hormonal  levels of the 
renin- angiotensin system (RAS), aldosterone and cortisol. T he following plasma markers of 
inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress  will be evalu ated: 1) CRP, 2 ) IL6, 3) TNF α, 4) PAI1, 
SOD, TBARS and ADMA will be assessed as well as nitrotyrosine and other markers of 
oxidative/nitrosative stress  .  
 
 
Statistical Procedures 
We propose that an effect size of 10% mean change from baseline in treated groups represents a clinically meaningful difference, and we propose that sample size reflects the ability to detect a 
10% change due to intervention factor.  
We intend to use the p arametric statistical procedures ANOVA and MANOVA in these analyses, 
based on our previous experience that the data from these tests is normally distributed in raw form or in some cases after simple log -transformations. If data are not normally distributed, the 
Wilcoxon signed -rank (within group) or Mann Whitney (between group) tests may be employed or 
Fisher’s exact test in case of small sample sizes. The level of significance will be set at p<0.05. 
Relationships and/or trends between the effect of Cycloset on neurovascular function and 
diabetic neuropathy will be determined with Spearman’s rank correlation.  
Based on these considerations, we calculate a total of 80 participants will result in a power 
greater than 0.80 for observing statistical significance at the p < 0.05 level. Specifically, we plan 
to recruit approximately 40 in the placebo group and approximately 40 in the treatment group.  In 
total, approximately 120 people will be screened in order to enroll approximately 80 participants 
in this study.   JMP statistical Software version 9.3 will be used to perform all statistical analyses.  
. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), providing details of the analys es and presentation structure of 
the results, will be developed and finalized before the database i s locked.

A.  Summary  
Type 2 diabetes is a growing health concern and diabetic subjects  are at high risk for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular complications (1). The CNS and the hypothalamus in particular have emerged as 
fundamental regulators of whole body homeostasis, including glucose and lipid metabolism (2). 
Several st udies on animal models of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and insulin resistance have shown 
multiple hypothalamic neurophysiologic derangements characterized mainly by [CONTACT_449321], and elevated adrenergic and serotoninergic tone (3, 3A). This cluster of derangements 
contributes to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_449302], but more importantly to the 
overactivity of sympathetic drive to the liver, adipose tissue and cardiovascular system. Increased 
sympathetic drive to adipose tissue stimulat es lipolysis with release of free fatty acids (FFA) and 
hepatic synthesis of VLDL, raising triglycerides that cause lipotoxicity with secretion of a number of 
inflammatory cytokines including TNFα and IL6. This induces a state of chronic low grade 
inflamma tion with increased oxidative/nitrosative stress and resistance to the action of insulin. 
Increased sympathetic drive to the liver induces hepatic glucose production and decreases hepatic glucose disposal elevating fasting and postprandial glucose levels ( 3). Sympathetic overactivity 
affects the cardiovascular system causing vasoconstriction of resistance vessels and inducing 
hypertension. This is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease including tachycardia, 
arrhythmias, sudden death and myocardial c ell apoptosis with impaired ventricular function and 
failure. Furthermore, reduction of parasympathetic function with loss of sympathetic/parasympathetic balance affects the anti -inflammatory state, levels of anti -inflammatory cytokines such as IL10 and 
the Leptin/Adiponectin ratio, thus increasing the inflammation and insulin resistance in T2DM (4).  
We have shown that loss of sympathovagal  balance occurs early in newly diagnosed T2DM and 
may precede the appearance of inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress, predicting 
macrovascular damage and cardiovascular events (5). Recently, three prominent studies,  
ACCORD, ADVANCE and VADT, ha ve shown that diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) 
may predict risk of sudden death with intensification of glycemic control (6 -11). While numerous 
likely mechanisms for the elevated incidence of cardiovascular events in these studies have been 
propos ed, the presence of autonomic dysfunction is emerging as one of the strongest predictors of 
cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, there are reports that directly associate autonomic dysregulation 
with inflammatory cytokines and adipocytokines, which subsequent ly increase and promote 
cardiovascular risk.  Quick -release (QR) bromocriptine has shown to improve HbA1C, fasting plasma 
glucose and postprandial glucose tolerance in subjects  with T2DM (12- 15). We have recently 
demonstrated that this drug can reset dopaminergic tone and, in one year, reduce cardiovascular 
death by 39% and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 52% (see preliminary data). This 
raises the question about t he mechanisms implicated for this effect. We hypothesize that 
bromocriptine- QR, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, resets dopaminergic tone, thus improving the 
sympathovagal balance and mitigating inflammation, oxidative/nitrosative stress and the metabolic 
consequences of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hyperglycemia and hypertension. In this study, we propose to 
investi gate the effects of bromocriptine QR on the unique relationship between autonomic function 
and inflammation in newly diagnosed versus established T2DM subjects .  These studies should 
shed new light on the mechanisms of cardioprotection by [CONTACT_449322]. This may 
lead, in time, to a new therapeutic focus for managing cardiovascular risk in T2DM.  
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page 11  20 October 2017   
B.  Detailed Background  
Obesity, insulin resistance,  and T2DM are growing health concerns, and the incidence and 
prevalence of these diseases are increasing worldwide (1) .  The CNS has been identified as a key 
regulator of whole body homeostasis. Evidence indicates that, within the brain, the hypothalamus in 
particular is responsible for the day -to-day regulation of a number of factors including body 
temperature, blood pressure, thirst, and hunger; and is a fundamental structure for the integration of the nervous and endocrine systems. Over the past decade, it has been shown that the CNS senses: 
1) ho rmones, namely insulin, leptin, and glucagon -like peptide (GLP) -1, and 2) nutrients, namely 
fatty acids and glucose, to regulate both energy and glucose homeostasis (2).   
Quick -Release (QR) Bromocriptine:  Bromocriptine is an ergot derivative that exerts 
activities as a sympatholytic dopamine D2 receptor agonist, adrenergic alpha- [ADDRESS_572483], and also as a modulator of serotonin and prolactin levels. It activates D2 receptors, which 
results in reduced norepi[INVESTIGATOR_449303] 
(16).  A QR formulation has recently been approved by [CONTACT_240066] T2DM.  Based 
on animal and human  studies, bromocriptine- QR administration within 2 h of awakening is believed 
to augment low hypothalamic dopamine activity and inhibit excessive sympathetic tone within the 
CNS. This results in reduced postprandial plasma glucose levels due to improvements in impaired 
hypothalam ic fuel sensing mechanisms and subsequent impaired insulin-  and non- insulin mediated 
glucose disposal and enhanced suppression of hepatic glucose production. Such treatment also 
reduces fasting and postprandial plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and triglyceride levels. Studies have 
shown that, in subjects  with poorly controlled T2DM treated with diet alone, metformin, 
sulfonylureas, or thiazolidinediones, the addition of bromocriptine produces a 0.5– 0.91 decrement in 
HbA1c and improves fasting plasma glucose and  postprandial glucose tolerance (12- 14) (see 
preliminary data).  A prospective 1- year study in type 2 diabetic subjects  demonstrated a significant 
40% relative ris k reduction among bromocriptine- QR treated subjects  of a composite pre -specified 
cardiovascular end point that included ischemic (m yocardial infarction and stroke) and non- ischemic 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449304], congestive heart failure and revascularization) related 
endpoints (15). In a further an alysis it reduced MACE by 39% and mortality by 50% within a year of 
treatment (see preliminary data). This is the first drug approved for the treatment of hyperglycemia 
that has shown a reduction on CV events. The mechanism of the drug’s beneficial effect on 
cardiovascular events has not been clearly delineated.  
Mechanism of action of bromocriptine:  Bromocriptine’s effects are mediated via resetting 
of dopaminergic and sympathetic tone within the CNS. Mammalian species living in the wild have 
the ability to alter their metabolism from the insulin- sensitive/glucose -tolerant state to the insulin-
resistant/glucose -intolerant state seasonally for survival.  Such metabolic changes are governed by 
[CONTACT_449323]/activity in the suprachiasm atic nuclei (SCN) of the 
hypothalamus and in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) (3) . Numerous studies implicate shifts 
in the circadian phase relationship between endogenous dopaminergic and serotonergic activity rhythms in SCN in  the transition from the insulin- sensitive to insulin- resistant state (reviewed in 3A). 
The VMH plays a pi[INVESTIGATOR_449305], hormonal secretion, 
peripheral glucose/lipid metabolism, and feeding behavior (17,18) . Importantly, Humans also do 
manifest circadian oscillations and seasonal changes in metabolism (3B).  Available evidence suggests that the same circadian neuroendocrine events that control peripheral metabolism and 
cardiovascular biology in species of all the major vertebrate classes is also operative in humans (3B, 
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page 12  20 October 2017  3C).  Hypothalamic centers that regulate these circadian rhythms receive inputs via numerous 
centers throughout  the CNS, neurogenic stimuli from peripheral tissues and gastrointestinal tract, 
hormonal signals, and signals from circulating metabolites. Interventions, such as timed daily bromocriptine administration to coincide with the daily peak in endogenous CNS dopaminergic activity which is diminished in insulin resistant states and, which alter monoamine neurotransmitter 
levels within these hypothalamic circadian centers, can exert significant improvements on glucose 
and lipid dysmetabolism (19).  It is believed that type [ADDRESS_572484] an early morning 
diminution  in dopaminergic tone, which leads to increased sympathetic activity (16) .  In lean, normal 
individuals, plasma prolactin concentrations peak at night during sleep and CNS dopaminergic activity peaks at the onset of waking. These neuroendocrine rhythms along with others function to 
entrain a circadian pattern of normal fuel metabolism.  In contrast, obese insulin- resistant individuals 
have elevated day time plasma prolactin levels (20) , and  reduced morning dopaminergic tone (21) .  
Administration of bromocriptine- QR reduces the elevated day -time prolactin levels (12,20,22)  
and restores central dopaminergic activity, thereby [CONTACT_449324], hepatic 
gluconeogenesis, postprandial plasma glucose, triglycerides, and FFA concentrations, all 
without increasing plasma insulin levels (Figure 2) (23) .  
Cardiovascular  risk in DM and b romocriptine:  It is well known that type 2 diabetic subjects  are at 
high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular complications. More than 50% of adults with T2DM have 
coronary artery disease (CAD), and death from CAD is two to five- times m ore likely in a diabetic 
than in a nondiabetic patient (24). Although hyperglycemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular events, 
it is relatively weak when compared with other risk factors such as dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, 
obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (25). However, even after correction of these 
more established risk factors, type 2 diabetic subjects  still remain at high risk for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular complications (26) . Moreover, a number of recent trials (27)  including ADVANCE (6)  
and VADT (7) , which ass essed the impact on cardiovascular events of intensive glucose- lowering 
therapy, were not able to demonstrate a significant reduction of cardiovascular events in the intensive group as compared to the standard group. The primary endpoints in these studies were 
similar, mainly MACE including: non -fatal MI, stroke, PVD, CABG and sudden death. None of these 
studies showed a significant reduction in MACE. Furthermore, in ACCORD, the study with the most 
ambitious goal (HbA1c < 6%), the overall and cardiovascular  mortality was greater in the intensive 
group, with a 22% increase in the likelihood of sudden death. The presence of autonomic 
dysfunction increased the risk of an event 2.[ADDRESS_572485] study but a marker for susceptibility to the event 
(8).  It now seems that autonomic imbalance coupled with peripheral nerve dysfunction are lead 
candidates conferring susceptibility to CV risk (11) . Therefore, anti -diabetic agents that not only 
improve glycemia but also reduce cardiovascular risk by [CONTACT_449325]/parasympathetic balance are highly desirable (3). 
Diabetic CAN is a serious complication found in one fourth of type [ADDRESS_572486] shown that 
autonomic imbalance may be a predictor for risk of sudden death with intensification of glycemic 
control (4,7,11) .  This can be attributable to autonomic imbalance between the sympathetic and 
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page 13  20 October 2017  parasympathetic nervous system regulation of cardiovascular function (4,28) . Chang et al. 
demonstrated that cardiac autonomic dysfunction (as measured by [CONTACT_449326][INVESTIGATOR_696] -
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_449306]) may occur prior to the development of insulin resistance in individuals with 1 or 2 
components of the metabolic syndrome (29). The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study showed that 
cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was common in subjects  with impaired glucose tolerance and 
metabolic syndrome, especially in the overw eight, obese subgroup (30) . We recently demonstrated 
the presence of cardiac autonomic dysfunction both in newly diagnosed and established diabetic 
subjects  (see preliminar y data) (5). Thus, parasympathetic tone may decline with an autonomic 
imbalance shifting toward augmented sympathetic tone during the development from normal glucose 
tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance and finally diabetes (31) . It is then not surprising to find 
abnormalities in autonomic function in the early stages of the disease, but without established autonomic neuropathy, suggesting a potential reversibility at the stage of newly diagnosed diabetes.  
In the cardiovascular safety trial (15), bromocriptine- QR reduced HbA1c, blood pressure, heart rate, 
and plasma triglycerides. However, these changes were modest and do not seem to explain the 40% decrease in composite cardiovascular outcome. We propose  that bromocriptine’s beneficial 
effect on cardiac events is that it decreases overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and 
attenuates overactivity of the HPA axis and the RAS. In animal studies, bromocriptine has been 
shown to attenuate the effect o f CNS sympathetic overactivity on the vasculature (32,33) . 
Furthermore, in humans, bromocriptine has been shown to decrease plasma norepi[INVESTIGATOR_449307], such as tilting (34 -
37). Although bromocriptine is no longer circulating or bound to D2 receptors throughout the [ADDRESS_572487] because of the appropriately timed dopamine pulse. 
As increased sympathetic activity is associated with both sustained ventricular arrhythmias and heart 
failure, the reduction in sympathetic activity that occurs with bromocriptine could improve ventricular 
function and decrease cardiac arrhythmias in the diabetic patient who has a higher prevalence of 
these cardiac complications (38) . Thus, bromocriptine-  QR’s potential to restore a diurnal 
variation in sympathetic activity in addition to its ability to decrease total sympathetic 
nervous system activity may explain its cardioprotective effect. Yet, this has not been further 
investigated.  
 Postprandial hypergl ycemia, which is decreased by [CONTACT_449327], has been shown to be 
associated with an increased risk of CV events in subjects  with and without T2DM (39) . Elevations of 
postprandial glucose especially when accompanied by [CONTACT_449328], lead to inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial 
dysfunction, which in turn may lead not only to increases in the volume of arterial atheroma but also 
to increased cardiac events. Pharmacological lowering of postprandial glucose has been shown to 
decrease cardiac events in some studies (STOP -NIDDM trial) (40- 42) but not in others 
(NAVIGATOR trial) (43,44) . Bromocriptine- QR significantly lowers postprandial glucose. This places 
it in a select group of drugs (α -glucosidase inhibitors, incretin mimetics, DPP4- inhibitors, pramlitide, 
thiazolidinediones and fast -actin g insulins) that have been shown to effectively lower postprandial 
glucose. Therefore, the decrease in cardiac events seen with this drug could also be due to its effects on postprandial glucose and lipid levels (postprandial dysmetabolism) (38) . However the 
mechanisms whereby [CONTACT_449329]. Here we will 
examine the contribution of changes in autonomic balance on postprandial blood glucose 
responses.  
Inflammation and Autonomic Imbalance:  IL6, IL12 and C reactive protein (CRP) have been 
associated with reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and sympathovagal balance (4) . Other markers 
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_572488] also been linked to 
CAN (4). It has been hypothesized that inflammation alters HRV, but the opposite directional 
relationship suggesting that autonomic changes could be pro -inflammatory is also conceivable (45) . 
Experimental data support both possibilities. IL6 and CRP were found to be associated with reduced 
heart rate variability (HRV) in a study of 264 middle- age male twins free of symptomati c coronary 
artery disease (45) . The results of this cross -sectional study suggest that autonomic dysregulation 
may lead to inflammation providing a pathway through which traditional risk factors promote the 
development of cardiovascular disease. Both exposure to acetylcholine and direct vagal stimulation 
inhibits release of cytokines by [CONTACT_179968] (46) . Conversely, sympathetic activation is pro -
inflammatory. In isolated adipocytes, β -adrenergic stimulation increases IL6 (47) , whereas β –
blockers dampen the IL6 increase normally seen in response to stress in rats (48). Given that 
cause– effect relationships cannot be determined from cross -sectional studies; prospective studies 
are needed to determine whether autonomic dysfunc tion mediates the inflammatory process or if 
autonomic imbalance is a consequence of inflammation. In the study performed in our lab we demonstrated an association between cardiac autonomic dysfunction and markers of inflammation 
(IL6, PAI1)  both in newly  diagnosed and established diabetic subjects  (see preliminary data) (5). An 
associ ation between both CRP and IL6 and diabetic polyneuropathy has also recently been 
demonstrated (49). 
Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress and Autonomic Dysfunction:  Growing evidence suggests that 
enhanced oxidative⁄nitrosative stress and, in particular, increased production of the potent oxidant 
peroxynitrite is a characteristic feature of both experim ental and clinical diabetes mellitus (50). 
Peroxynitrite causes damage to a variety of tissues, including peripheral nerve, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], dorsal root ganglion neurons, and vasa nervorum (51) . Several markers of oxidative stress in pl asma, 
including superoxide and peroxynitrite, are elevated in subjects  with diabetes and cardiac autonomic 
neuropathy (52). These findings suggest the presence of peroxynitrite cytotoxicity at both early and 
advanced stages of diabetes and, furthermore, at the pre -diabetic stage.  Here we will examine the 
relationship between modulation of autonomic balance and the amelioration of oxidative and nitrosative stress.   
Leptin and Autonomic Dysfunction:  It is well documented that leptin, secreted by [CONTACT_449330], plays a critical role in the regulation of energy, body weight and glucose homeostasis (2) . 
Recent observations strongly suggest that leptin, just as insulin, can also regulate glucose 
homeostasis independent of its effects on weight loss (53) . Leptin’s glucose homeostatic regulation 
also has a central component and the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) has been spotlighted as the key CNS site.  Hyperleptinaemia may be an important player in the activation of the sympathetic 
nervous system in humans. Leptin levels were associated with a shift of sympathovagal balance 
toward increased sympathetic activation in a study of 120 non -obese adults (54) . Leptin receptor -
deficient db ⁄ db mice develop T2DM, hypertension and obesity, with a disrupted circadian blood 
pressure, highe r resting heart rates as well as loss of heart rate variability (55).  In our study (5) we 
showed a fall in the adiponectin/leptin ratio in newly diagnosed diabetes with further progression in 
established diabetes which accompanied the changes in autonomic balance (see preliminary data). 
This evidence shows that alterations in leptin homeostasis may have important 
consequences in the balance of the autonomic nervous system and changes in leptin in 
relation to autonomic balance with bromocriptine QR treatment will be monitored.  
Adiponectin and Autonomic Balance:  Another adipocyte- derived protein that may be regulated by 
[CONTACT_449331]. In humans with autonomic imbalance (i.e. 
predominant sympathetic activation), low levels of circulating adiponectin have been demonstrated 
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page 15  20 October 2017  (56). Adiponectin acts in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus to coordinate neuroendocrine and 
autonomic functions (57) . Parasympathetic input to adipose tissue has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_449332] (58), illustrating that adipose tissue does receive dual autonomic control. This is important in the 
regulation of cytokine release, as well as in the control of rel ease of FFA and the development of 
oxidative/nitrosative stress. In our study we showed decreased adiponectin/leptin ratios in both 
newly diagnosed and established diabetes and a significant correlation between these ratios and 
abnormalities in the ANS function (see preliminary data) (5). There appears to be a closed- loop 
system, wherei n the adipose tissue mass regulates the hypothalamic autonomic system, with both 
the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system impacting the metabolic and inflammatory potential of adipose tissue.  
Significance of the proposal:  Reduced HRV, the hallmark of  autonomic dysfunction, has been 
shown to have consequences in terms of morbidity (e.g. progression of coronary atherosclerosis) 
and mortality (59) , independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in various populations, 
including those with pre- diabetes and diabetes (60,61) . With a growing understanding of bi -
directional interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic effer ent pathways at different 
levels of the neuro- axis and at target organs involved in inflammation (62) , it is possible that this 
neuroinflammatory pathway  may be a key component involved in both the etiology and the clinical 
course of cardiovascular disease (4). The question arises as to what the mechanism could be. A 
number of biochemical and molecular abnormalities involved in the development of atherosclerosis, 
as well as multiple cardiovascular risk factors (hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated FFA 
and hypertensi on) have been show n to improve with bromocriptine -QR therapy. Actually, it is not 
clear whether bromocriptine’s reduction on cardiovascular events is due to the drug’s 
beneficial effect on any of these pathologic processes since the response is so rapid and of 
such large magnitude.  Recent preclinical studies suggest that anti -inflammatory 
mechanisms in liver, other metabolic tissues, and the vessel wall itself as well as an effect to 
reduce reactive oxygen/nitrogen species generation in the vessel will contribute to the effects of bromocriptine- QR to reduce CVD outcomes (62A, 62B) Further mechanistic studies 
are necessary to establish the mechanism of action providing cardiovascular protective benefit of this therapy.  Trials with bromocriptine have been per formed in subjects  with more 
established diabetes. We propose to conduct an interventional study with bromocriptine- QR in 
subjects  with newly diagnosed versus established T2DM to evaluate its effects on cardiovascular 
autonomic function, HPA axis hormones and inflammatory markers of disease. This will aid into 
further understanding of the mechanisms by [CONTACT_449333] . The possibility of reversing autonomic imbalance by

2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
To demonstrate the effects of dopaminergic activation with b romocriptine- QR on the regulation of 
plasma neuroendocrine factors such as the h ypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -axis (HPA) hormones , and on the 
plasma levels  of markers of  inflammation  and oxidative/nitrosative stress in type 2 diabetes  subjects. 
The study will eval uate treatment  effects on inflammatory markers, the leptin/ adiponectin system, 
and hormonal levels of renin- angiotensin system (RAS), aldosterone and cortisol. Specifically, we 
will evaluate the following markers of inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative s tress: 1) CRP, 2) IL6,  
3) TNF α, 4) PAI1, SOD, TBARS and ADMA and nitrotyrosine as well as other markers of 
oxidative/nitrosative stress .  The study  will evaluate the leptin/adiponectin system by [CONTACT_449338] (TA), high molecular weight (HMW ) adiponectin, leptin, and their ratios (TA/leptin and 
HMW adiponectin/leptin) .  A co -secondary objective of the study will be to assess the impact of 
bromocriptine- QR vs Placebo on measures of insulin resistance and glycemic control (e.g., OGTT 
glucose and insulin, Matsuda index, HOMA -IR, HbA1c).  
The treatment effects on all of the above primary and secondary outcomes will also be assessed as 
a function of the duration of diabetes and other baseline demographics such as HbA1c, concomitant 
medications and m etabolic status.  
3 STUDY DESIGN, DURATI ON AND DATES  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN 
This is an interventional, twenty -four week, randomized, double blind, placebo- controlled trial with 
bromocriptine- QR  in subjects  with early diabetes  and established T2DM to evaluate it s effects on 
the cardiovascular and peripheral autonomic nervous system, as well as on inflammatory markers, 
the leptin/adiponectin system, hormonal levels of RAS and HPA, indices of insulin resistance  and 
glycemic control , and measures of oxidative and ni trosative stress.  A total of [ADDRESS_572497] 40 
but no more than 60  subjects  with established diabetes will be enrolled in the study  and each 
randomiz ed to treatment with bromocriptine -QR or p lacebo.  Subjects  will be required to be on a 
stable anti -diabetes regimen consisting of either diet  and/or oral anti -diabetic agents consisting of 
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page 20  20 October 2017  metformin alone or metformin plus an insulin secretion enhancer (sulfonylurea, DPP4 Inhibitors, or 
GLP-1 analogs) for at least 60 days prior to randomization. Following a 2 week lead- in period, 
subjects  will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive UDT (usual diabetes therapy) plus 
bromocriptine- QR or UDT plus placebo. Subjects must have a  documented C-peptide level of >2 
ng/ml from the  screening visit.  The circadian timing of the interventional therapy will be within [ADDRESS_572498] 4 weeks, the daily dose 
of the study drug will be titrated up by [CONTACT_449339] (0.8 mg b romocriptine- QR or 1 matching placebo 
tablet ) per day on a weekly basis until a maximal tolerated dose of at least two tablets (1.6 mg/day  
bromocriptine- QR or 2 placebo tablets ) and no more than four tablets (3.2 mg/per day  b-QR or 4 
placebo tablets ) is achieved. During the first 4 weeks of the study, subjects  will be called weekly to 
monitor for possible adverse events. Subjects will be maintained at their maximum tolerated dose of 
between two to four tablets per day (1.6 to 3.2 mg bromocriptine- QR per day  or 2 to 4 placebo 
tablets ) for t he duration of the study.  Subjects unable to tolerate two tablets per day of study drug 
will be terminated from the study and any further analyses.  Subjects will be seen at 4 weeks after randomization, at 12 weeks after randomization, and then at study end (week 24 or early 
termination). A pr imary analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints  will be performed after [ADDRESS_572499] on a daily basis.  Subjects  will be required to continue their usual anti -diabetes 
regimen during the study but will be allowed to alter the dosages of these medications  and/or add or 
subtract medications  as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_449340]. In any case, rescue therapy for 
hyperglycemia will be administered  if a subject has two consecutive fasting glucose measurements 
>270 mg/dL spaced ≤7 days apart before week 12, or two consecutive fas ting glucose 
measurements >25 0 mg/dL spaced ≤7 days apart or a HbA1c >11% at or after week 12.  The choice 
of rescue therapy will be at the discretion of the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_449313]/or addition of other glucose 
lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  The subject s with concurrent antidiabetes medication changes may remain "on 
study" for the remainder of the study until w eek [ADDRESS_572500] venipuncture 
techniques for determination of:  Fasting serum glucose,  HbA1c, and C -peptide (C-peptide may be 
non-fasting) ; lipid profile including total serum cholesterol, HDL, LDL, FFA and triglycerides ; 
comprehensive metabolic panel including creatinine, AST  and ALT; TSH,  renin, angiotensin, 
aldosterone, ACT H, cortisol, prolactin, and serotonin.  Oral glucose tolerance tests and HOMA 
measure of insulin resistance and beta cell function will also be determined. All of these assays are 
performed routinely by [CONTACT_449341]. We will also collect samples to assess markers 
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page 21  20 October 2017  of inflammation  and oxidative/nitrosative stress which include 1) CRP, 2) IL6, 3) TNF alpha, 4) PAI1, 
SOD, TBARS and ADMA  and nitrotyrosine as well as other measures of oxidative/nitrosative stress . 
We will measure total adiponectin (TA ), high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin, and their 
ratios (TA/leptin and HMW adiponectin/leptin).   The analyses of plasma markers of inflammation, 
oxidative/nitrosative stress, neuroendocrine factors and the adiponectin/leptin ratio will be conducted 
at Vero Science LLC  (Tiverton, RI).    
 
 
Autonomic function tests-  ANS function will be assessed by [CONTACT_449342] (HRV), which is reduced early in the development of autonomic imbalance  in 
diabetic subjects , and has been associated with increased risk for death after myocardial 
infarction.  Power spectral analysis of HRV will be  assessed  using ANSAR (ANX 3.0 software; 
ANSAR  Group, Inc., Philadelphia, PA) . The ANSAR Parasympathetic and Sympathetic (P&S) 
monitoring method was  developed and validated by [CONTACT_449343] (MIT) Biomedical Engineering department (Akselrod and Aysin). The P&S 
monitoring method received US FDA Market Clearance in 1995.  Time - and frequency -domain 
analyses will be performed. Time -domain analysis provides a measure of the sympathetic and 
parasympathetic control of the heart beat (the R -R interval  on an electrocardiogram) recorded with 
maneuvers including deep breathing, Valsalva , and standing  from the supi[INVESTIGATOR_449314] -domain analysis is  performed under resting conditions. Given their complementary  nature 
both w ill be utilized in this study. Specifically, total spectral power (TSP) is the average low 
frequency plus high frequency for each phase during baseline, deep breathing, Valsal va, and 
postural stimulations. The sample difference of the beat to beat (NN) intervals  measures heart rate 
variability , and was significantly impaired in both diabetic groups when compared to healthy controls  
in our prior study. The TSP will be calculated, as well as the standard deviation of all normal R -R 
intervals (sdNN), a measure of both sympathetic and parasympathetic action on HRV, and the root -
mean square of the difference of successive R -R intervals (rm SSD), a measure primarily of 
parasympathetic activity. It is also a measure of changing heart rate variability. These time and 
frequency domain analyses will allow quantification of ANS components, including 
sympathetic/parasympathetic balance before and after treatment  with bromocriptine -QR. We 
anticipate that autonomic balance, lost early in T2DM subjects , will be re -established with 
bromocriptine- QR therapy.  
 
 
Sudorimetry - Sweat glands have a preganglionic sympathetic innervation that is regu lated by 
[CONTACT_449344]. T he functional impairment of this system can 
cause abnormal sweating. The Sudoscan (Impeto Medical, Paris, [LOCATION_009]) will be used to measure 
the impact of autonomic imbalance on the sweat gland system using revers e iontophoresis. The 
Sudoscan will employ sudorimetry to assess sweat gland nerve fiber function. Test-retest reliability 
in [ADDRESS_572501] was excellent for the feet (Correlation 
coefficient of 0.8, p<0.0001).  Changes in  peripheral autonomic function have now been shown 
to correlate with indices of insulin resistance and inflammation . We will determine if 
abnormal peripheral autonomic function occurs in newly diagnosed vs. established diabetes 
and if these are modified by [CONTACT_449345]- QR. 
 
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page 22  20 October 2017  Skin blood flow (SkBF): methods and procedures-  Since activation of the sympathetic arm of 
the autonomic nervous system has profound effects on microvascular function we will 
quantify this using laser Doppler techniques. We antic ipate that impaired microvascula r 
perfusion seen in newly diagnosed and established diabetes will be correctible with 
bromocriptine- QR. Continuous laser Doppler (CLD) will be used to assess skin blood flow in 
response to several stimuli and allows us to evaluate sympathetic versus neuropeptidergic control of 
neurovascular perfusion. CLD measurements are a reliable index of SkBF and are uninfluenced by [CONTACT_449346] (63). Several  pi[INVESTIGATOR_449315]:  the 
Periflux Mast er Unit PF4001- 2, the Peritemp heating module with sensor PF4005- 3, and the 
(Pressure Unit) (all from Perimed, Inc., Smithtown, NY). After a 30- minute acclimation period 10 
minutes of baseline blood flow will be recorded.  Following this ten minute period heat will be applied 
to stimulate WT and NOCI blood flow.  WT stimulation will be achieved at 40° C and NOCI 
stimulation will be achieved by [CONTACT_449347] 44° C for 10 and 40 minutes respectively. Skin 
perfusion will also be measured during cholinergic  stimulation.  
 
Laser Doppler Skin Blood Flow Imaging-  Laser Doppler imaging (Moor Instruments Inc., 
Wilmington, DE) is a standard non -invasive, non -contact [CONTACT_449348] .  Sympathetic overactivity affects the 
cardiovascular system causing vasoconstriction of small, resistance vessels and we will use this 
technique as a measure of peripheral sympathetic activity.  Skin blood flow images will be recorded 
using the Moor LDI2 -VR imager.  A visible red laser beam will be placed 14 inches from the exposed 
site and it will take a few minutes to scan over each site being measured.  The information collected 
by [CONTACT_449349] a color coded image displaying the skin blood flow at that site.  
 
Quantitative sensory tests (QST) - Sympathetic activation can be measured by [CONTACT_449350]. Enhanced responses to these stimuli (hyperesthesia 
and hyperalgesia) reflect increases in sympathetic tone and will be used as a measure of enhanced 
peripheral sympathetic activity mediated by [CONTACT_449351]. We will use our previously published methods and algorithms for measuring small fiber somatosensory function, including cold and warm thermal  sensation, and cold-  and heat -
induced pain thresholds at the dominant great toe, forearm, and finger in all  subjects (64).  Generally 
for each of these non- noxious sensations we will use the method of limits, 4 ascending trials with an 
inter-stimulus interval randomly varying from 4 to 20 seconds using the Medoc TSA 2001 / VSA 
3000 (Medoc Advanced Medical, Minneapolis, MN).  Threshold is calculated as the mean stimulus intensity level over all [ADDRESS_572502] 
recruitment period may vary.

7.3 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Statistical analyses will be conducted on between group (bromocriptine- QR vs. placebo) differences 
in change from baseline of all primary and secondary endpoints .  The treatment effects on all of the 
primary and secondary outcomes will also be assessed as a function of the duration of diabetes and 
other baseline demographics such as HbA1c, concomitant medications and metabolic status. Mean 
differences of glycemic control, various derivative autonomic function values, and inflammatory 
marker levels will be compared first using standard Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), with diagnostic 
group entered as the predictor variable.  Within -group analysis for change in primary and secondary 
endpoints after 12 weeks of treatment will be done using repeated measures MANOVA (multivariate 
analysis of variance). For glycemic control analysis patients will be stratified according to post -
prandial insulin response.  If data are not normall y distributed, the Wilcoxon signed -rank (within 
group) or Mann Whitney (between group) tests may be employed or Fisher’s exact test in case of 
small sample sizes. The level of significance will be set at p<0.05. Relationships and/or trends 
between the effect of Cycloset on neurovascular function and diabetic neuropathy will be determined 
with Spearman’s rank correlation.  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), providing details of the analys es and presentation structure of the 
results, will be developed and finalized before the database is locked.  
A local laboratory  will be utilized for collection and analysis of the laboratory tests associated with 
efficacy, and safety. Standardized guidelines for preparation, collection, and centralized analysis of blood speci mens will provide uniformity of the data and will avoid potential inter -laboratory variability 
due to inconsistent methodology.  
The analyses of plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative/nitrosative stress, neuroendocrine 
factors, and the adiponectin/lepti n ratio will be conducted at VeroScience (Tiverton, RI).    
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_572514] of bromocriptine -QR on changes in autonomic function measured  
by [CONTACT_449359],  including power spectral analysis of heart rate as well as peripheral autonomic function 
using sudorimetry and l aser scanning of peripheral microvascular autonomic control.  
7.3.2  Secondary endpoint  
Secondary endpoints will be the evaluation of  bromocriptine -QR’s effects on inflammatory markers, 
neuroendocrine factors, markers of oxidative/nitrosative stress, the leptin/ adiponectin system, and 
hormonal levels of renin- angiotensin system (RAS), aldosterone and cortisol.  A co-secondary

8 ADVERSE EVENTS 
8.1 DEFINITIONS  
8.1.1  Adverse Event  
The term  adverse event  covers any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or 
illness that develops or worsens during the period of observation in the clinical study.  Clinically relevant abnormal results of diagnostic procedures including abnormal laboratory finding s (e.g., 
requiring unscheduled diagnostic procedures or treatment measures, or resulting in withdrawal from the study) are considered to be adverse events.  
Worsening of a sign or symptom of the condition under treatment will normally be measured by [CONTACT_449361] y parameters.  However, if the outcome fulfills  the definition of “serious adverse event”, it must 
be recorded as such (see Section 8.1.2 ). 
The adverse event may be:  
• A new illness  
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page 34  20 October 2017  • Worsening of a concomitant illness  
• An effect of the study medication, including comparator  
• A combination of two or more of these factors  
No causal relationship with the study medication or with the clinical study itself is implied by [CONTACT_449362] “adverse event”.  
Adverse events fall into the categories “non- serious” and “serious” (see Section 8.1.2 ). 
Surgical procedures themselves are not adverse events; they are therapeutic measures for 
conditions that require surgery.  The condition for which the surgery is required is an adverse event, 
if it occurs or is detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by [CONTACT_449363](s) leading to these measures are not adverse events, if the condition(s) was (were) known before the start of study treatment.  In the latter case t he condition 
should be reported as medical history . 
8.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is one that at any dose (including overdose):  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening1 
• Requires in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8686]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity2 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event3 
1“Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the serious 
adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to carry out normal li fe functions.  
3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in situations where no outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical events that 
may not be immediately life- threatening or resul t in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449317].  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of  drug dependency or drug abuse.  A 
diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as medically important.  
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_572515] of Critical Terms ([ADDRESS_572516], provided in the “Instructions for completing the ‘Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a 
Clinical Trial’ form”) should be u sed as guidance for adverse events that may be considered serious 
because they are medically important.  
Clarification of the difference in meaning between “severe” and “serious”  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a spec ific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as “serious”, which is based 
on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_572517] to reporting as alert terms in this study.  
However, cases in which a “significant overdose” of the investigational product was taken and a non-
serious adverse event or no adverse event occurred are to be reported to the sponsor in an 
expedit ed manner on a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial” form.  
In addition, any pregnancy diagnosed in a female subject or in the female partner of a male subject during treatment with the investigational product must be reported to the sponsor immediately.  
Information related to the pregnancy must be given on a “Dru g Exposure via  Parent – Data 
Collection” form that will be provided by [CONTACT_456].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_572518] gives informed consent until 30 days (± 3 days)  after the last dose of study 
medication was given.   
If the investigator detects a serious adverse event in a study subject after the end of the period of 
observation, and considers the ev ent possibly related to prior study treatment, he or she should 
contact [CONTACT_449364].  
8.3 DOCUMENTATION AND RE PORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS BY [CONTACT_449365] R 
All adverse events that occur during the  observation period set in this protocol (see Section 8.2) 
must be documented on the pages provided in the case report form in accordance with the 
instructions for the completion of adverse event reports in clinical studies.  These instructions are 
provided in the investigator’s study file and in the case report form itself . 
The following approach will be taken for documentation:  
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page 36  20 October 2017  • All adverse events (whether serious or non- serious, or considered as an alert term) must be 
documented on the “Adverse Event” page of the case report form.  
• If the adverse event is serious (see Section 8.1.2 ), the investigator must complete that 
section of the Adverse Event case report form.  
• This form must be completed and faxed to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
department within 24  hours.  
• If the adverse event is listed as an alert term (see Section 8.1.3) even if the “alert term” is 
non-serious, the investigator must compl ete, in addition to the “Adverse Event” page in the 
case report form, a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial” form at 
the time the adverse event is detected.   
• This form must be completed and faxed to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
department within 24  hours.  
• When a “significant overdose” of the investigational product occurs without an adverse event 
or in other situations where the sponsor requires an expedited report without an adverse 
event  (see Section 8.1.3 ), the investigator should only complete a “Serious Adverse 
Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial” form.  Instructions on where to send t his form 
will be provided by [CONTACT_456].  In this case, there is no need to complete the “Adverse 
Event” page in the case report fo rm. 
Every attempt should be made to describe the adverse event in terms of a diagnosis.  If a clear 
diagnosis has been made, individual signs and symptoms will not be recorded unless they represent 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_49197], in which case they should be reported as 
separate events. If a clear diagnosis cannot be established, each sign and symptom must be 
recorded individually.  
All subjects who have adverse events, whether considered associated with the use of the 
investigational pr oducts or not, must be monitored to determine the outcome.  The clinical course of 
the adverse event will be followed up according to accepted standards of medical practice, even 
after the end of the period of observation, until a satisfactory explanation is found or the investigator 
considers it medically justifiable to terminate follow -up. Should the adverse event result in death, a 
full pathologist’s report should be supplied, if possible.  
All questions on the completion and supply of adverse event report forms and any further forms 
issued to the investigator at a later date to clarify unresolved issues should be addressed to the 
sponsor.  
8.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING BY [CONTACT_449366] S PONSOR  
Serious adverse events and adverse events that fulfill a reason for expedited reporting to Pharmacovigilance ( alert term and/or  “significant overdose”, as defined in Section 8.1.3 ) must be 
documented on  the Adverse Event  form. 
• This form must be completed and faxed to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigila nce department within 
24 hours . 
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_572519] be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness and 
(serious) adverse event, and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the 
investigational product(s).  
Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or 
laboratory values received after the report) must be documented on a follow -up Adverse Event  form.  
 
Veroscience – Confidential  Page 38  20 October 2017  9 WITHDRAWALS  
9.1 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study (i.e. from any further study medication or  study 
procedure) for the following reasons:  
• At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative*  
• If, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation in the study would be detrimental to the subject's 
well-being  
• At the specific request of the sponsor  
* “Legally authorized representative” means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject’s participation in the 
procedure(s) involved in the research.  
Subjects must be withdrawn from the investigational product under the following circumstances:  
• Women who become pregnant  
• Women of childbearing potential who discontinue contraception with the intention of 
becoming  pregnant.  
In all cases, the reason for and date of withdrawal must be recorded in the case report form and in 
the subject's medical records.  The subject must be followed up to establish whether the reason was an adverse event, and, if so, this must be reported in accordance with the procedures in Section 8. 
The investigator must make every effort to contact [CONTACT_449367] -up.  Attempts to contact 
[CONTACT_449368]’s records (e.g., times and dates of attempted 
telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter).  
Subject withdrawal due to deterioration of glycemic control  
If a subject has a HbA1c of > 12% or fasting glucose readings of greater than 275 mg/dl on two 
consecutive days , then the subject’s regimen must be adjusted to include medications offering 
stricter glycemic con trol. As per the exclusion criteria, subjects requiring insulin must be withdrawn 
from the study. If the subject's HbA1c remains > 12%, he/she should cease study treatment to be 
stabilized  on alternative medications.  Subjec ts that are withdrawn will be referred to their primary 
care physician or endocrinologist  for further diabetes medication adjustments as needed .   
Replacement of subjects 
Subject s that are withdrawn within 4  weeks  following completion of study drug titration will be 
replaced. As far as possible, for subjects who are withdrawn from the study,  all safety examinations 
scheduled for the final study day will be performed prior to withdrawal.

Veroscience – Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_572521]'s participation in the trial, the investigator and/or institution should ensure 
that adequate medical care is provided to a subject for any adverse events, including clinically 
significant laboratory values, related to the trial.   The investigator and/or institution should inform a 
subject when medical care is needed for intercurrent illness(es) of which the investigator becomes 
aware.   
9.5 ANALYSIS VARIABLES  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), providing details of the analyses and presentation structure of the 
results, will be developed and finalized before the database is locked.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_572522] size of 10% mean change from baseline in treated groups represents a 
clinically meaningful difference, and we propose that sample size reflects the ability to detect a 10% 
change due to intervention factor.  
We intend to use the parametric statistical procedures ANOVA and MANOVA in these analyses, 
based on our previous experience that the data from these tests is normally distributed in raw form 
or in some cases after simple log- transformations. If data are not normally distributed, the Wilcoxon 
signed- rank (within group) or Mann Whitney (between group) tests may be employed or Fisher’s 
exact test in case of small sample sizes. The level of significance will be set at p<0.05. Relationships 
and/or trends between the effect of Cycloset on neurovascular function and diabetic neuropathy will 
be determined with Spearman’s rank correlation.  
Based on these considerations, we calculate a total of [ADDRESS_572523] atistical significance at the p < 0.05 level. Specifically, we plan to recruit 
approximately 40 in the placebo group and approximately 40 in the treatment group.  In total, 
approximately 120 people will be screened in order to enroll approximately 80 parti cipants in this 
study.  JMP statistical Software version 9.3 will be used to perform all statistical analyses.

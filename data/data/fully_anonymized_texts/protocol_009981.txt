Study Title  
Posterior Foss a Decompression with or without Duraplasty for Chiari type I Malformation with 
Syringomyelia: A prospective, cluster randomization trial of up to 238  subjects recruited from 36 
centers of the Park -Reeves Syringomyelia Research Consortium  as well as an addit ional 8 research 
centers . 
  
Objectives  
Children with Chiari type I malformation (CM) and syringomyelia (SM), a ‘rare disease’, may 
suffer debilitating pain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_18262], neurological deficits (myelopathy, weakness, sensory 
loss, and impaired gait), and a diminished quality of life (QOL) [1 -3].  CM+SM is treated with 
neurosurgical decompression of the craniovertebral junction with either of two technical 
variations: 1) posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD), the gold standard operation, 
which involves intradural microsurgical d issection and duraplasty; or 2) extradural posterior fossa 
decompression (PFD), in which the dura is not opened.  The Central Hypothesis of this proposal 
is that, compared with PFDD, PFD  will be associated with fewer surgical complications and 
less harm to  patie nts, yet will provide non -inferior  clinical improvement and syrinx 
regression.  With a more favor able risk profile and non -inferior  clinical outcomes, patients 
undergoing PFD will experience superior QOL.   We will conduct a prospective, cluster 
rando mized controlled trial of PFD versus PFDD in order to test this hypothesis and achieve the 
following Specific Aims:  
 
Specific Aim 1:  Determine if PFD is associated with fewer surgical complications and less harm 
to patients than PFDD.  
Hypothesis: PFD will be associated with fewer surgical complications and less potential harm to 
patients than PFDD.     
Anticipated Outcome:  Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) -related complications ≤6 months (e.g. CSF 
leak, pseudomeningocele, aseptic meningitis, infection, and hydroce phalus ) and requirement for 
additional surgery for wound revision or CSF diversion will be lower after PFD compared with 
PFDD.  
 
PCORI CER -1503 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 6 Specific Aim 2:   Determine if PFD provides non -inferior clinical improvement and syrinx 
regression compared to PFDD.   
Hypothesis:  Clinical improvement and syrinx regression provided by [CONTACT_485519] -inferior 
compared to those provided by [CONTACT_485520].  
Anticipated Outcome:   Clinical symptoms, neurological function, and syrinx regression ≤12 
months will be non -inferior following PFD when compared with PFDD.  Rates of revision 
decompression surgery (PFD or PFDD) and progression of spi[INVESTIGATOR_18262] ≤12 months after PFD 
also will be non-inferior to PFDD.  
 
Specific Aim 3:   Determine if PFD is associated with superior QOL compared with  PFDD.  
Hypothesis:  With fewer surgical complications, PFD will be associated with superior QOL 
compared with PFDD.  
Anticipated Outcome: PFD will have superior QOL and will show improvements in overall QOL 
over time (≤[ADDRESS_623776] -operatively) compared t o PFDD.  In particular, both physical metrics 
(evaluated by [CONTACT_485521], pain severity and non -pain symptoms) and psychosocial metrics will 
improve at a higher rate and in a shorter period of time after PFD compared to PFDD.  
 
Design and Outcomes   
This will be a cluster  randomized control trial of up to 238 patients  (see section 9.5 data analysis, 
re-estimation in  power calculations section below) recruited from the 36 centers of the Park -
Reeves Syringomyelia Research Consortium (PRSRC)  as well as an additional  8 research centers .  
Randomization will occur at the center level with standardized surgical technique, and data will 
be recorded in the PRSRC prospective registry.  In order to examine the main  comparative 
effectiveness research (CER ) question of surgical complications and potential harm to patients 
(Aim 1), intra -operative complications and short (≤6 months) and long -term (6 -12 months) 
postoperative complications will be recorded for both PFD and PFDD.  For Aim 2, clinical 
sympto ms, neurological function, and modified Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale (mCCOS) [22] 
scores will be measured pre -operatively and longitudinally at ≤6 weeks , 3-6 months , and 12 ±2 
months after surgery.  MRIs  will be obtained (at a minimum) ≤ 6 months pre-operat ively  and 12[ADDRESS_623777] Aim 3 hypothesis, QOL will be assessed at the same time points using the Chiari 
Health  Index Pediatrics (CHIP), and the Health Ut ilities -3 (HUI -3), holistically evaluating patients 
across psychosocial and physical dimensions . 
Interventions and Duration  
This study will compare the outcomes of PFDD vs PFD.  The study will occur over a five year 
period.  The enrollment period will last for two years  and 8 months .  Data collection for each 
participant is for the primary analysis is  to be one year and will be structured in the following 
manner : 
- Pre-operative  (the initial outpatient neurosurgery visit prior to decompression)  including  
CHIP & HUI -[ADDRESS_623778]-Operative  
- ≤[ADDRESS_623779]-operation  including CHIP & HUI -[ADDRESS_623780]-operation  including CHIP & HUI -3 QOL questionnaire

Specific Aim 1:  Determine if PFD is associated with fewer surgical complications and less harm 
to patients than PFDD.   
Hypothesis:  PFD will be associated with fewer surgical complications and less potential harm to 
patients than PFDD.   
Anticipated Outcome:  Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) -related complications ≤6 months (e.g. CSF 
leak, pseudomeningocele, aseptic meningitis, infection, hydrocephalus), and the requirement fo r 
additional surgery for wound  revision or CSF dive rsion will be lower after PFD compared with 
PFDD.

Specific Aim 2:   Determine if PFD provides non -inferior clinical improvement and syrinx 
regression compared to PFDD.   
Hypothesis:  Clinical improvement and syrinx regression provided by [CONTACT_485519] -inferior 
compared to those provided by [CONTACT_485520].  
Anticipated Outcome:   Clinical symptoms, neurological function, and syrinx regression ≤12 
months will be non -inferior following PFD when co mpared with PFDD.  Rates of revision 
decompression surgery (PFD or PFDD) and progression of spi[INVESTIGATOR_18262] ≤12 months after PFD 
also will be non-inferior to PFDD.

Specific Aim 3:   Determine if PFD is associated with superior QOL compared with PFDD.  
Hypo thesis:   With fewer surgical complications, PFD will be associated with superior QOL 
compared with PFDD.  
Anticipated Outcome: PFD will have superior QOL and will show improvements in overall QOL 
over time (≤[ADDRESS_623783] -operatively) compared to PFDD.  In  particular, both physical metrics 
(evaluated by [CONTACT_485521], pain severity and non -pain symptoms) and psychosocial metrics will 
improve at a higher rate and in a shorter period of time after PFD compared to PFDD.   
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
2.1 Background o n Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Chiari type I malformation (CM) and syringomyelia (SM) are closely associated but incompletely 
understood disorders of the craniovertebral junction and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], respectively (Fig. 1). 
Syringomyelia (SM ) is a potentially debilitating neurological condition characterized by [CONTACT_485522][INVESTIGATOR_485455] [1].  SM is classified as a ‘rare disease’ by [CONTACT_485523] (NIH), with an estimated 7 -9 new cases/year/100,000, and about 40,000 people 
currently affected in the [LOCATION_002] [2-6].  Children with CM+SM frequently s uffer chronic 
pain, including headaches and spi[INVESTIGATOR_485456], spi[INVESTIGATOR_18262], and neurological deficits 
such as sensory loss or weakness [7-10].  Left untreated, these symptoms may progress to result 
in debilitating paralysis, progressive scoliosis requiring surgical correction, sexual dysfunction, or 
bladder and bowel incontinence.  High cervical or brainstem  SM may result cranial nerve 
dysfunction, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], or apnea.  Fortunately, progression of disease is gradual and may 
be halted —and in some cases reversed —with effective neurosurgical treatment [9-13].   
 
While it is widely recognized that surgical 
decompression of the craniovertebral junction 
provides symptomatic improvement and syrinx 
regression in up to 80 -90% of patients with 
CM+SM [7, 9, 10, 12, 13], the optimal surgical 
technique remains highly controversial. The 
fundamental difference between the two major 
operative approaches for treating CM+SM is the 
surgical opening of the dura mater, the thickest and 
strongest of the three linings of th e central nervous 
system.  Opening the dura  in this region provides 
access to the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) cisterns, the 
surface of the cerebellar tonsils, the foramen of 
Magendie (the opening of the 4th ventricle), the brainstem, and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  In  cases when the 
dura is opened, a duraplasty is performed, which involves an expansile closure of the dura, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_485457]. Many surgeons fervently believe that opening the dura, with or 
without intradural microsurgical dissection, followed by [CONTACT_485524][INVESTIGATOR_485458] (CVJ) and permitting reduction 
in the SM size.

Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 9 2.2 Study Rationale  
Syringomyelia is a rare disease associated with substantial, lifelong disability , ranging from 
chronic pain to debilitating paralysis, spi[INVESTIGATOR_18262], and death from respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]  [14].  
While some types of SM are not treatable, CM -associated SM is readily treated by [CONTACT_485525], which provides symptomatic improvement and 
syrinx regression in up to 90% of patients [15].  However, the optimal surgical technique —one 
that effectively eliminates symptoms and prevents disability while minimizing complications and 
harm to patients —remains unc lear.  The debate over which surgical technique, PFDD or PFD, to 
recommend to patients is among the most controversial topi[INVESTIGATOR_485459] [16], and 
currently these decisions are being  made in the absence of evidence about the comparative 
effectiveness of PFDD or PFD .    
 
Termed posterior fossa decompression with 
duraplasty (PFDD), this combination of 
procedures is considered the ‘gold 
standard’ operation for CM+SM (Fig. 2).  
However, opening the dura carries a 
significant risk to patients (Table 1); a 
recent meta -analysis of numerous 
retrospective clinical series demonstrated surgical complications noted in 18.5% of patients who 
underwent PFDD (range 8.3 -66.7%, Table 2).  Due to this alarmingly high rate of complications, 
there has been increasing interest in recent years i n extradural posterior fossa decompression 
without dural opening or duraplasty  (PFD).  PFD markedly reduces the surgical risks of PFDD, 
but its efficacy remains unclear, and patients who undergo PFD may experience inferior resolution 
of symptoms and may be  more likely to require revision decompression surgery (Table 2).  
However, available data are derived primarily from single -center retrospective analyses [17-25], 
and at present, the choice of PFD or PFDD is largely based on surgeon preference or sur geon 
experience rather than medical evidence [26]; no evidence -based guidelines exist.  The current 
study proposes to  address this critical gap  in the management of CM+SM to compare  the 
risk of harm to patients, the effectiveness, and the change in QOL associated with PFDD 
versus PFD .

The current study —which has been guided by [CONTACT_485526], patient advocacy 
organizations, physician and non -physician stakeholders, and supported by [CONTACT_485527] (AANS), the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) , 
and the Joint AANS/CNS Pediatric Section —is designed to  address this critical gap  in the 
management of CM+SM by [CONTACT_485528], eff ectiveness, and impact on QOL 
between  PFDD and PFD.  
 
The information that will be obtained from this study is of paramount importance to patients and 
families who are faced with making critically important and consequential healthcare decisions at 
a time of extreme duress.  Patients and f amilies are often overwhelmed to learn  that they have a 
complex and progressi ve neurological disorder with long -term implications for their health. This 
shock is often compounded by [CONTACT_485529] — “Which surgery should we choose?”  “Which has hig her 
risks?”  “Which is more likely to harm my child?”  “Is one more likely to help my child?”  “I 
don’t want them to suffer through this more than once.”   Right now, these questions are 
unanswerable; the current study will help patients and families to ans wer these questions and  make 
informed healthcare decisions about how best to help their children whi le minimizing the risk of 
harm .  In designing this study with patient partners a nd advocacy groups, this was a  resounding 
priority for research in CM+SM.  
 
This study will have tremendous impact by [CONTACT_485530] (PFDD or PFD) that: 
1) minimizes surgical complications and potential harm to patients; 2) maximizes symptomatic 
relief and syrinx resolution; and 3) provides the highest Quality o f Life (QOL) for patients.   The 
results of this study will transform  management of this disorder in real and substantial ways that 
are critically important to patients and families, stakeholders, and clinicians  by:

Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 11 1. Addressing the knowledge gap in treating CM+SM: No high quality evidence -based 
data exist for the treatment of CM+SM.  The results of this study will enable us  to 
establish best neurosurgical practices to improve healthcare delivery and 
outcomes for CM+SM by [CONTACT_485531].  
2. Assist patients and families with difficult healthcare decisions: The information 
provided through this study will create a paradigm shift away from the current 
reliance on individual surgeon preferences and experiences. In i ts place, these 
results will enable patients and families to appreciate the rationale, risks, and 
benefits of the various surgical strategies for CM+SM so that they can make 
informed, consequential decisions regarding their own healthcare . 
3. Understand the impact of CM+SM, both acutely and chronically, on QOL in children.  
To date, nearly all CM+SM studies have focused on physician assessment of clinical 
outcomes in CM+SM.  By [CONTACT_485532] -specific, patient -centered QOL 
instruments, this study will provide entirely novel, rigorously determined insights 
into the impact of CM+SM on QOL in children and how QOL changes in the 
short - and long -term after surgery.  
3. STUDY DESIGN  
SPECIFIC AIMS  
Children with Chiari type I malformation (CM) and syri ngomyelia (SM), a ‘rare disease’, may 
suffer debilitating pain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_18262], neurological deficits (myelopathy, weakness, sensory 
loss, and impaired gait), and diminished quality of life (QOL) (2, 7, 8, 27).  CM+SM is treated 
with neurosurgical decomp ression of the craniovertebral junction with either of two technical 
variations: 1) posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD), the gold standard operation, 
which involves intradural microsurgical dissection and duraplasty; or 2) extradural poste rior fossa 
decompression (PFD), in which the dura is not opened.  The Central Hypothesis of this proposal 
is that, compared with PFDD, PFD will be associated with fewer surgical complications and 
less harm to patie nts, yet will provide non -inferior  clinica l improvement and syrinx 
regression.  With a more favor able risk profile and non -inferior  clinical outcomes, patients 
undergoing PFD will experience superior QOL.   We will conduct a prospective, cluster 
randomized controlled trial of PFD versus PFDD in ord er to test this hypothesis and achieve the 
following Specific Aims:  
Specific Aim 1:  Determine if PFD is associated with fewer surgical complications and less harm 
to patients than PFDD.  
Hypothesis: PFD will be associated with fewer surgical complications and less potential harm to 
patients than PFDD.     
Anticipated Outcome:  Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) -related complications ≤6 months (e.g. CSF 
leak, pseudomeningocele, aseptic meningitis, infection, and hydrocephalus) and requirement for 
additional surgery for wound revision or CSF diversion will be lower after PFD compared with 
PFDD.  
 
Specific Aim 2:   Determine if PFD provides non -inferior clinical improvement and syrinx 
regression compared to PFDD.   
PCORI CER -1503 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 12 Hypothesis:  Clinical improvement and syrinx regression provided by [CONTACT_485519] -inferior 
compared to those provided by [CONTACT_485520].  
Anticipated Outcome:   Clinical symptoms, neurological function, and syrinx regression ≤12 
months will be non -inferior followin g PFD when compared with PFDD.  Rates of revision 
decompression surgery (PFD or PFDD) and progression of spi[INVESTIGATOR_18262] ≤12 months after PFD 
also will be non-inferior to PFDD.  
 
Specific Aim 3:   Determine if PFD is associated with superior QOL compared wi th PFDD.  
Hypothesis:  With fewer surgical complications, PFD will be associated with superior QOL 
compared with PFDD.  
Anticipated Outcome: PFD will have superior QOL and will show improvements in overall QOL 
over time (≤[ADDRESS_623784] -operatively) compared  to PFDD.  In particular, both physical metrics 
(evaluated by [CONTACT_485521], pain severity and non -pain symptoms) and psychosocial metrics will 
improve at a higher rate and in a shorter period of time after PFD compared to PFDD.  
4. SELECTION AND ENROLL MENT O F PARTICIPANTS.  
This study will leverage the unique resources of the Park-Reeves Syringomyelia Research 
Consortium (PRSRC) , a U.S.-based  network of  major children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], each  with a high -
volume pediatric  neurosurge ry and orthopedic surgery center.  For the curren t study,  additional  
PRSRC sites have been recruited and agreed t o participate, (please refer to Appendix I for a full 
listing of the structure of the PRSRC).  Due to the highly specialized pediatric neurosurgical care 
required for the manage ment of CM+SM, each site serves as a regional referral center for this rare 
condition, and the demographics of patients cared for at each site are thus representative of the 
demographic distribution of each region . 
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria   
1) Age ≤21 years old  
2) Chiari malformation type I  with ≥5 mm tonsillar ectopia  
3) Syrinx  diameter  (recorded as the greatest antero -posterior or transverse diameter)  3-9 mm 
4) MRI of  the brain and cervical and thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_485462]  
4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
1) Syrinx <3 mm and/or ≥10  mm 
2) Neuro -imaging demonstrating basilar invagination  (position of the superior tip of  
 dens 5 mm above Chamberlain’s line)  
3) Neuro -imaging demonstrating  clival canal angle <120°  
4) Prior PFD, PFDD, or other surgery at the craniovertebral junction  
5) CM+SM secondary to other pathology (e.g. a tumor)  
6) Unable to share pre-decompression MRI of the brain and cervical and thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
7) Patients who do not w ish to p articipate  
 
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures   
Potential participants will be identified, screened, and recruited thro ugh the clinical practices of 
48 participating sites.  In this trial, the randomization unit will be the PRSRC center; therefore, the 
same intervention will be used for all qualifying patients enrolled at each center.  If a surgeon in a 
PRSRC center strongly believes that a patient shoul d undergo a certain procedure (PFDD or PFD) 
PCORI CER -1503 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 13 and should not be randomized, that patient will be excluded from the study.   Effective 
randomization will occur through the random distribution of patients to centers employing each 
procedure (PFDD and PFD).    
 
Barriers to enrollment  will be addressed by [CONTACT_485533]’s screening  log and 
REDCap screening/enrollment tool , which includes individuals who were eligible for enrollment, 
but were not enrolled in the study. These logs  (see Appendix III) RED Cap results will be supplied 
by [CONTACT_99894]. Louis Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/Washington University -St. Louis and will be reviewed to assure 
that each participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_485463]. If study 
enrollment is slowe r than an ticipated, more ancillary PRSRC sites  will be added .  PRSRC has been 
approached by [CONTACT_485534], and adding more ancillary sites is 
readily feasible.   
 
4.[ADDRESS_623785] Recruitment  
When the clinical site coordinator and/or inve stigator becomes aware of a patient who is 
potentially eligible for enrollment into the study, patient eligibility will be confirmed, and the study 
investigator or coordinator will approach the child’s parent/guardian and/or the patient (as 
applicable) to offer participation.  Each center will maintain a screening log and complete a 
REDCap screening/enrollment tool for any participants who are eligible for enrollment, but are 
not enrolled into the study.  These data will be reviewed to assure that each participating center is 
enrolling subjects without significant bias.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_623786] is eligible, the site investigator or designee will approach the 
parent/gu ardian to offer participation for their child in the study.  The parent/guardian will be 
informed about the objectives of the study and the potential risks and benefits of trial participation.  
If the parent/guardian refuses permission for their child to p articipate, then all clinical care will be 
provided to the child in accordance usual institutional practice.  Assent will be obtained for patients 
meeting age requirements for assent.   Informed consent /assent  will be obtained in the relatively 
focused atmo sphere of a clinic  or similar  room rather than the more chaotic pre -operative holding 
area just before surgery . 
 
 
4.6 Randomization and Treatment Allocation  
A cluster randomized controlled trial (C -RCT) will be conducted to compare the two major 
neurosurgical treatments for CM+SM, PFDD and PFD.  The cluster size is expected to be  on 
average  6 participants per center.  In order to participate, PRSRC centers with multiple pediatric 
neurosurgeons were given the option of complying with the treatment allocation and following a 
standardized procedure or selecting a single study neurosurgeon for the group.  If the latter scenario 
was chosen, the group had to agree that all CM+SM patients referred to that center must be treated 
by [CONTACT_485535].  For cluster randomization, a computer -generated randomization 
sequence will be generated independently by [CONTACT_4305].  All eligible participants within 
each cluster will then be approached for informed consent for the purposes of data collecti on for 
the trial.   
PCORI CER -1503 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 14 5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
The inter vention performed will either be a PFD or PFDD .  It will be predetermined, based on 
cluster randomization, which procedure each center performs on their respective participants.  A 
computer -generated randomization sequence will be generated independently by [CONTACT_191478]. The surgery will occur in each respective center’s operating room.  With the exception 
of uniformly receiving the designated ce nter intervention, all research participants will receive 
usual clinical care in accordance with institutional practice and judgment.  Clinical care will 
include at a minimum an initial clinical evaluation by a participating pediatric neurosurgeon, 
surgica l treatment (PFDD or PFD) and associated perioperative care, and routine post -operative 
care with prescribed follow -up clinical assessments at ≤6 weeks , 3-6 months , and 12 months (+/- 
2 months = 10 -14 months) after surgery . Patients will be given the oppor tunity to re -consent into 
a study extension where any visits occurring within 5 years postoperativ ely will be documented, 
and the QOL questionnaires may be given annually.   Research data will be collected at all stages 
by [CONTACT_485536]/ coordinators with strict oversight by [CONTACT_485537].  Neuro -imaging is a critical element of the trial, required both for 
enrollment and to monitor treatment efficacy .  As such,  MRI of the brain and cervical and th oracic 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_485464].  Pre -operative lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_485465].  MRI of the cervical and thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_485452] 12 months (+/-2 months = 10 -
14 months) post-operatively.   These are required fo r clinical care of CM+SM patients, regardless 
of participation in the study, and funding is not requested for these examinations. MRI of the 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], CT of the brain or cerv ical/thoracic/lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], “long cassette” or “scoliosis” X -
rays, and/or  X-rays of the cervical/thoracic/lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_485466] , will be reviewed if 
obtained.  In the case where the patient returned outside the window  for primary analyses,  a 
secondary analysis will include those visits up to [ADDRESS_623787] been randomized to before enrollment occurs.  
Therefore, every potential participant/family will be aware of which procedure would be 
performed if s/he agreed to participate.   If the procedure is not an appropriate fit f or a particular 
patient or, the patient/family is not comfortable with the predetermined procedure, the patient will 
not be enrolled and they will be offered standard of care treatment by [CONTACT_485538]

[CONTACT_485541] (ABNS) and the American Board of Pediatric 
Neurological Surgery (ABPNS)  or the America n Osteopathic Board of Surgery (AOBS).   Prior to

wise fashion.  As detailed in the videos, PFDD and PFD both begin with a midline p osterior 
suboccipi[INVESTIGATOR_485467]. Suboccipi[INVESTIGATOR_485468] ± 
cervical laminectomies are performed based upon the level of tonsillar position on the pre -
operative MRI.  The posterior atlanto -occipi[INVESTIGATOR_485469].  For PFD, the operation is complete (dural 
scoring or splitting is permitted), and wound closure is initiated.  For PFDD, the dura is then incised 
and retracted fo r microsurgical dissection. Intradural maneuvers are performed at the surgeon’s 
discretion based on the intra -operative findings, but may include exploration/fenestration of an 
arachnoid veil, lysis of adhesions, or tonsillar reduction.  Following the intr adural dissection, the 
duraplasty is performed with autologous graft or dural substitute, and the wound is closed in 
standard fashion.  Dural opening without subsequent dural closure is not permitted for PFDD or 
PFD.  
5.[ADDRESS_623789] syrinx surgery (syrinx fenestration or shunt) are not 
permitted.  
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Periodic quality assurance checks will be performed primarily via remote  monitoring by

Consenting Procedure  
Informed consent will be obtained in the relatively focused atmosphere of a clinic or 
similar room rather than the more chaotic pre -operative holding area just before surgery.  
 
When a clinical site investigator and/or rese arch coordinator identifies a candidate for the 
study, patient eligibility will be confirmed, and the study investigator or coordinator will 
approach the individual to offer participation. After a thorough discussion to inform the 
patient and family of the  rationale and objectives of the study and the risks, benefits, and 
alternatives to participation, written informed consent will be obtained from a parent or 
legal guardian (patient <18 years of age) or the patient themselves (patient ≥18 years of 
age).  A dditionally, assent will be obtained for patients of appropriate age, according to 
individual institutional practices.  If study participation is declined, then all clinical care 
will be provided to the child in accordance with institutional practice and j udgment.  Each 
center will maintain a log of any individuals who are eligible for enrollment, but are not 
enrolled in the study. These logs will be reviewed to assure that each participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_485471]. In uncer tain cases, adjudication of patient 
eligibility will be performed by a committee blinded to intervention and outcome and 
considering only the information available at the time of enrollment.  Patients will be 
offered the opportunity to re -consent to partici pate in continued data collection for five 
years post -operatively.  
 
6.2.2 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization  
Enrollment  
In order to allow participants and their families the opportunity to make an informed 
decision about participating in the study , the consent and assent shall be reviewed and 
signed prior to surgery .  Enrollment may occur in one of the follow manners: 1) the 
participant signs the consent ( participant 18 years ); 2) at least one parent/legal guardian 
signs the consent (participant less than 18 years old ); or 3) participant  less than [ADDRESS_623791] one parent/legal guardian  (requires that the 
participant is able to read the consent and understands and agrees with it; this may vary 
by [CONTACT_485542]’s lo cal IRB’s guidelines) .  For those participants who are unable to read 
and understand the consent , but are able to read, understand, and agree with the assent , 
that document  will be signed based on the IRB guidelines.

Individual trial centers will be randomized to perform either PFDD or PFD.  In order to 
participate, trial centers with multiple pediatric neurosurgeons were given the option of 
complying with the treatment allocation and following a standardized procedure or 
selecting a s ingle study neurosurgeon for the group.  If the latter scenario was chosen, the 
group had to agree that all CM+SM patients referred to that center must be treated by [CONTACT_485543].  For cluster randomization, a computer -generated randomization 
sequence will be generated independently by [CONTACT_485544] a participant .  All eligible participants within each cluster will then 
be approached for informed consent for the purposes of data collection for the trial. Each 
participant/guardian will know the randomized treatment selection at the time of the

7.2.1 Preliminary Data   
PCORI CER -1503 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 24 The Park-Reeves 
Syringomyelia Research 
Consortium (PRSR C) is a 
U.S.-based network of 36  
major pediatric 
neurosurgery centers 
focused on improving the 
care of children with 
CM+SM.  The largest 
research effort for CM+SM 
to date, PRSRC began 
enrolling patients bo th 
retrospectively and 
prospectively in 2011.  
Through the PRSRC, 
comprehensive clinical and 
radiographic data have been 
obtained on >600 CM+SM 
patients. Table [ADDRESS_623798] -
operative complications 
observed in 589 subjects 
with complete data who 
underwent PFDD or PFD 
since 2011, as support for 
PFD has grown. Within the 
PRSRC, rates of 
complications are remarkably consistent with those reported in the meta -analysis by [CONTACT_485545] -Olenec in 2008 (Table 2) [27], with complications noted in 17.8% following PFD D versus 
2.7% after PFD.  In addition, a corrective neurosurgical procedure for complication management 
was needed more often after PFDD compared to PFD (10.1% versus 2.7%).  However, repeat 
decompression surgery for persistent disease was required in only  5.0% of PFDD cases versus 
12.3% after PFD.  
In planning a clinical trial for CM+SM, it is important to select appropriate inclusion 
criteria for study patients in order to: 1) enhance homogeneity in disease severity among study 
participants; 2) permit appropriate comparisons across participants and groups; and 3) ensure 
clinical equipoise among treating physicians.  With this goal in mind, our group recently created 
the Chiari Severity Index, or CSI, a pre -operative instrument that stratifies children w ith CM+/ -
SM based on their probability of postoperative improvement [12].  The CSI was developed in 
conjunction with patient and families and uses their input as a critical arbiter of outcome.  Two 
advanced methodologies, sequential sequestration and conjunctive consolidation, were used to 
identify ke y clinical and radiographic predictors of clinical outcome and then to integrate them 
into one useful CSI (Fig. 3).  Table 3.  Complications and Need for Repeat Surgical Decompression for

 25 We also recently completed a 
systematic review of outcome methods 
used in studies of CM+SM and noted that 
studies of CM+SM were significantly 
impeded by [CONTACT_485546] [28]. The majority of papers used 
a clinician’s “gestalt” impression of 
symptomatic improvement (Fig. 4).  Only 3 
papers used scales validated in patients 
with CM+/ -SM, and only 7 articles 
incorpora ted patient -response instruments.  
Our review emphasized the need for 
CM+SM -specific patient -based 
instruments to improve research in this field [28]. 
The Chiari Health Index in Pediatrics (CHIP) wa s developed in response to the deficiencies 
noted in our systematic review and addresses the following criteria: 1) it focuses on the complaints 
most important to CM + SM patients; 2 ) it relies on patient involvement in answering the 
questions; 3) it is ag e-appropriate; and 4) and it helps inform clinical decision making regarding 
the treatment and management of these patients [29].  As with o ther Health -Related QOL 
(HRQOL) inventories, the CHIP was designed to be discriminative, evaluative, and predictive [30, 
31].  A single [ADDRESS_623799] 
reliability, an d confirmatory factor analysis were 
used in the development and validation of the 
CHIP (Table 4).   The number of items for each 
component is as follows: pain frequency 5, pain 
severity 5, non -pain symptoms 11, and 
psychosocial characteristics 24.  In our initial 
studies, we have demonstrated that the CHIP is a 
feasible, reliable, and valid assessment of 
HRQOL in pediatric CM + SM patients. In 
particular, each domain and the overall HRQOL tool showed strong feasibility (i.e. the practical 
ability of partici pants to complete the survey) and internal consistency within their respective 
domain (α ≥ 75%), a measure of reliability of the test [32]. In addition, the physical (r = 0.73) and 
psychosocial components (r = 0.94), as well as overall HQROL score (r = 0.83), had high test -
retest reliability, even over a median test -retest interval of [ADDRESS_623800] validity of the CHIP by [CONTACT_485547]-3 scores within similar domains [32].

Figure 3 . The Chiari Severity Index, or CSI, was developed using sequential 
sequestration of pre -operative clinical and radiographi c parameters, 
followed by  [CONTACT_485548] [12]. Syrinx size was the only radiographic measure 
associated with clinical outcome, with a critical threshold of 6 mm diameter.  
 
Figure 4.   Systematic review of outcome methods used in 74 CM+/ -
SM studies revealed inconsistent and limited methods of evaluating 
clinical outcomes; a majority of papers relied on clinician ‘gestalt’ 
assessments rat her than CM+SM -specific, patient -based 
instruments. [28]

DSMB meetings.  The DCC will provide written summary of the DSMB’s periodic review of 
AEs to clinical site investigators for submission to their respective IRBs.

8. INTERVENTION DISCONT INUATION  
For the p urposes of this trial, the intervention is either of two technical variants of surgical 
decompression for CM+SM, PFD or PFDD.  While it is possible that intra -operative factors that 
could influence a surgeon’s plan to carry out the intended procedure (PFD or PFDD), this would 
be highly unlikely.  Nevertheless, if the surgical technique is aborted or changed during the 
PCORI CER -1503 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 33 procedure, participants will be followed per study protocol  with all associated clinical care and 
data collection.  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
9.1 General Design Issues   
The Central Hypothesis of this proposal is that, compared with PFDD, PFD will result in fewer 
surgical complications and thus less harm to patients within 12 (+/- 2 months ) months of 
surgery. With a more favorable risk profile and non-inferior effect on clinical outcome and 
syrinx size compared with PFDD, PFD will be associated with superior QOL . In the case 
where the patient returned outside  planned study follow -up window , a secondary analysis will 
include those visits up to 24 mon ths. 
 
This study is designed as a cluster randomized controlled trial (C -RCT) of the two major 
neurosurgical treatments for CM+SM: posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD) and 
extradural posterior fossa decompression (PFD).  This design was cho sen with input from site 
investigators (neurosurgeons) in order to obtain participation from a large number of pediatric 
neurosurgeons and reduce crossovers and non -participation resulting from physician bias. While 
there is inherent individual surgeon bia s, clinical equipoise exists across the field; this is 
underscored by [CONTACT_485553] >50% of the pediatric neurosurgeons in the [LOCATION_002] in 
this RCT and support of this study by [CONTACT_485554], the CNS, and the Joint AANS/CNS Pediatric 
Section . 
 
Speci fic Aim 1:  Determine if PFD is associated with fewer surgical complications and less harm 
to patients than PFDD.  
Hypothesis: PFD will be associated with fewer surgical complications and less potential harm to 
patients than PFDD.     
Anticipated Outcome:  Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) -related complications ≤6 months (e.g. CSF 
leak, pseudomeningocele, aseptic meningitis, infection, and hydrocephalus) and requirement for 
additional surgery for wound revision or CSF diversion will be lower after PFD compared with 
PFDD.  
 
Specific Aim 2 : Determine if PFD provides non -inferior clinical improvement and syrinx 
regression compared to PFDD . 
Hypothesis:  Clinical improvement and syrinx regression provided by [CONTACT_485519] -inferior 
compared to those provided by [CONTACT_485520].  
Antic ipated Outcome:  Clinical symptoms, neurological function, and syrinx regression ≤12 
months will be non -inferior following PFD when compared with PFDD. Rates of revision 
decompression surgery (PFD or PFDD) and progression of spi[INVESTIGATOR_18262] ≤12 months afte r 
PFD also will be non -inferior to PFDD.  
 
Specific Aim 3 :  Determine if PFD is associated with superior QOL compared to PFDD.  
Hypothesis:  With fewer surgical complications, PFD will be associated with superior QOL 
compared with PFDD.   
Anticipated Outcome:  PFD will have superior  QOL and will show improvements in overall 
QOL over time (≤[ADDRESS_623805] -operatively) compared to PFDD.  In particular, both physical

Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 34 metrics (evaluated by [CONTACT_485521], pain severity and non -pain symptoms) and psychosocial 
metric s will improve at a higher rate and in a shorter period of time after PFD compared to 
PFDD.   
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
9.2.1 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
This study is designed as a cluster randomized controlled trial (C -RCT) of the two major 
neurosurgical treatments for CM+SM: posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD) 
and extradural posterior fossa decompression (PFD).  This design was chosen with input from 
site investigators (neurosurgeons) in order to obtain participation from a large number of 
pediatric neurosurgeons and reduce crossovers and non -participation resulting from physician 
bias.  During extensive discussions with PRSRC investigators and patient partners, there was 
significant concern for selection bias due to crossove rs and selective enrollment if individual 
patients were randomized, a known problem in surgical trials [33].  Site investigators felt that 
having their entire practice randomized to one technique would  increase surgeon comfort and 
experience with that approach, thereby [CONTACT_485555]. 
Consequently, individual PRSRC centers will be randomized to perform either PFDD or PFD.  
In this design, PRSRC centers will be serve as the u nit of inference for comparing PFDD and 
PFD, and the cluster size is expected to be 6 per center.  For cluster randomization, a 
computer -generated randomization sequence will be generated independently by [CONTACT_191478].  Overall sample size of up to 238  participants will be enrolled. Approximately 
50%  participants per procedure over the  enrollment  period . 
 
Potential participants will be identified, screened, and recruited thro ugh the clinical practices 
of 36 participating PRSRC sties  in addition to 8 other sites .  In this trial, the randomization 
unit will be the PRSRC center; therefore, the same intervention will be used for all qualifying 
patients enrolled at each center.  If a surgeon in a PRSRC center strongly bel ieves that a pati ent 
should  undergo a certain procedure (PFDD or PFD ), the patient will not be randomized . 
Effective randomization will occur through the random distribution of patients to centers 
employing each procedure (PFDD and PFD).  
9.[ADDRESS_623806] (DSMB) of  members.  T he DSMB will meet once prior to the star t of the study, and will 
approve the final protocol prior to its impl ementation.  Additionally,  the DSMB will establish 
a charter to guide its function. The charter would include rules of procedure, definitions of a 
meeting quorum, and information about me eting logistics.   
 
The purpose of the DSMB is  to advise PCORI, the  Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_485580]), and 
the Investigators Committee regarding the continuing safety of study participants and the 
continuing validity and scientific merit of the study. The DSMB is responsible for monitoring 
accrual of study subjects, adherence to the study protocol, assessment of data quality, 
performance of individual clinical sites, review of serious adverse events and other subject 
safety issues, and review of formal interim statistical analyses of treatment efficacy.  The DCC

the trial continues (futility), or if the risks/benefit ratio is not favorable. Each DSMB meeting

and each local IRB .  
9.[ADDRESS_623808] is reduction in harm  to patients, measured 
as surgical complications  and/or requirement for reoperation for complication management 
≤12 (+/- 2 months)  months after initial PFDD or PFD.  Complications and reoperation are 
associated with additional pain as well as emotional and psychological stress, longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_67550], and lost time from school/work.   Secondary outcomes focus on efficacy outcomes and 
will include: 1) compa rison of pre -operative symptoms and  neurological deficits  at ≤6 weeks , 
3-6 months , and 12  (+/- 2 months)  months after surgery  and syrinx size  and spi[INVESTIGATOR_485475] 
(coronal and sagittal Cobb angles) at 12 (+/- 2 months)  months after sur gery; and  2) assessment 
of QOL (including psychosocial and physical dimensions) at baseline, ≤6 weeks , 3- 6 months , 
and 12  (+/- 2 months)  months after surgery. This outcome will be evaluated using the CHI P 
and the HUI -[ADDRESS_623809] 
of the trial, will adjudicate the primary outcome measure.  The committee wi ll review the 
primary endpoint based on a blinded review of clinical notes, data forms and imaging studies.  
Decisions by [CONTACT_485556]. Consensus definitions 
of CSF -related complications following neurosurgery ha ve been developed [34]. These 
definitions have been reviewed and approve d by [CONTACT_485557], 
and will be used in this trial. Likewise, the extent of syrinx resolution following surgery will 
be determined by [CONTACT_485558].  By [CONTACT_22242], treatment failure 
(i.e. need f or revision PFDD or PFD) will be determined individually by [CONTACT_485559]/family, since such decisions are inherently subjective and based 
both on the surgeon’s level of concern and the patient’s discomfort and relat ive acceptance to 
the inherent risks of surgery (either PFD or PFDD).  
9.5 Data Analyses    
A Priori  Plans for Data Analysis  
Descriptive Statistics  
Using CONSORT guidelines for cluster -randomized trials, 53 We will present descriptive statistics,  
for continuous variables the m ean (+/-standard deviation) or  median (minimum, maximum ) values  
PCORI CER -1503 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 36 and for categorical variables the frequencies and proportion  for each  cluster; These presentations 
will be  carried out at baseline and at [ADDRESS_623810] of key assumptions : Due to the fact that each 
patient in a given center will be assigned to the same procedure, it is possible to observe  unequal 
overall sample sizes for each procedure. The initial analysis plan is to give equal weights to all 
clusters. If there is imbalance in the prognostic factors, we will use weighted analyses where the 
cluster -level summary score is weighted inversely  proportional to the reciprocal of its estimated 
varianc e. 
 
Comparison methods  
 
The primary outcome is a binomial outcome measured as a surgical complication and/or 
requirement for reoperation for complication management ≤ 6 months after initial PFDD or PFD . 
To account for within cluster correlation , possibly variable cluster size and the relatively small 
number of clusters  in this cluster randomized trial, generalized estimating equations ( GEE ) with 
small -sample correction or random effect logistic regressi on will be used for the primary analysis 
of this cluster randomized trial [35, 36].  
 
Secondary outcomes include Treatment Efficacy variable s and Quality of Life variables. 
Continuous variables measured at 3 time points over the 12 (+/- 2 months) month follow -up will 
be analyzed using longitudinal analysis with linear mixed models including the random cluster 
effect. Binomial and ordinal data will be analyzed using GEE methods accounting for cluster.  In 
the case where the patient returned outside the planned study follow -up window , a secondary 
analysis will include those visits up to 24 months.  
 
Missing data : Based on PRSRC data  and early data from this trial , loss to follow -up rate is  expected 
to be low (< 2%). To prevent missing data, we will meet with patients at 1 month, 3 -6 months and 
at 12 +/-2 months after the procedure. Every effort, including phone call reminders to patients, will 
be made  to decrease loss to follow -up. Loss to follow -up, missing data, and the reasons leading to 
loss of follow -up or data will be recorded .  In case of missing data, we will impute missing dat a 
using different methods . Because of the repeated measures nature o f the data, the ‘last observation 
carried forward’ method will be utilized [37].  In addition, Buck’s method, which is the extended 
version of regression imputation, will be used [38]. The Buck’s imputation will be based on the 
observed values of patient’s age, CM (≥  5mm tonsillar ectopia), syrinx diameter, and pre -operative 
comorbidities.  In addition to the overall rates of missing data for each procedure, because of the 
cluster randomized trial, we will also monitor the missing data within each cluster and center a nd 
report the discrepancy between the loss to follow -up rates for each procedure. Special attention 
will be given and separately reported if the entire clus ter is loss to follow -up.  As a sensitivity 
analysis for the missing data, study results will be compared for the following three conditions: 1) 
patients with missing primary outcome variable are excluded from analyses; 2) results with last 
observation carried forward, and 3) res ults with Buck’s method. Robustness of the results under 
each scenario will be assessed .  
PCORI CER -[ADDRESS_623811] (HTE) : As an exploratory analyses, to assess if the procedure is 
most beneficial for a specific subgroup, the heterogeneity of the effect of performing PFDD vs 
PFD will be assessed within the following pre -determined subgroups based on: 1) patient age at 
the time of surgery (<5 years, 5 -12 years, 13 -18 years); 2) CM status (5 -12 mm tonsillar ectopia, 
>12 mm tonsillar ectopia) [39]; 3) syrinx diameter  (3-6 mm, 7 -9 mm) ; and 4) preoperative 
hydrocephalus or  neuromuscular disease, two comorbidities associated with increased morbidity 
following pediatric CM +/ - SM surgery [40]. Demographic and comorbidity data will be collected 
by [CONTACT_485536]/ coordinators with strict oversight by [CONTACT_485537].  As the 5th subgroup, the effect of surgeon’s experience on the 
occurrence of surgical complications and requirements for re -operations for complications for each 
procedure during the 1st vs 2nd year of the award period will be assessed.  For HTE analysis, the 
test of procedure (PFD vs PFDD) by [CONTACT_485560] (such as age) interaction will be performed 
to assess the homogeneity of the procedure effect within each subgroup. If the test of interaction 
indicates a significant interaction for  any subgroup, then, Gail and Simon’s test of qualitative 
interaction will be performed [41].   All pre -specified subgroup analyses (patient’s age, CM status, 
syrinx diameter, comorbidity, and surgeons’ experience) will be reported regardless of observing 
a statistically significant or not -significant effect.  
 
Sub-analysis by [CONTACT_485561] (3 -6 mm, 7 -9 mm):   A planned subgroup analysis for the syrinx 
diameter will be performed. Each of the three specific aims will be separately analyzed  within the 
syrinx diameters of [ADDRESS_623812] is homogeneous within each of the syrinx size subgroups 
(3- 6 mm vs 7 -9 mm). If the test of interaction indicates heterogeneity, using the whole 3 to 9 mm 
syrinx diameter  range , analyse s will be performed, to identify,  if any, a cut -off point to propose 
using one surgical method over the other. For example, whether  the PFD is associated with greatly 
fewer surgical complications when the syrinx diameter is less than 5mm, but surgical comp lication 
rates are similar for PFD and PFDD when the syrinx diameter is ≥6 mm will be examined.    
  
Aim 1: Sample Size Recalculation (November 29, 2017)  
The original sample size calcul ation was performed based on  surgical complica tion rates (≤12 
months) f rom Park-Reeves Syringomyelia Research Consortium (PRSRC) estimates  (17.8% in 
PFDD and 2.7% in PFD cases ). We originally did not have an estimate for the ICC. Based on the 
literature, we assumed ICC of 0.05 i n our calculations [43]. The overall sample size of enrolled 
patients would be 238 patients, approximately 119 patients per procedure over the two years  of 
enrollment.  
In preparation for our PFD trial annual meeting on November 2 9, 2017 , we performed a sample 
size re -calculation, using  the ICC observed f rom the 47 patients enrolled in the  study and for which 
complete data was available as of November 2 8, 2017. It should be noted that the data was only 
used to  calculate the ICC;  no interim analyses were performed. The ICC based on the first enrolled 
47 patients was 0.000059, much smaller than what  was assumed (0.05) for the or iginal sample size 
calculation. However, we expect this ICC estimate to change with more enrollments.  
Enrollmen t in the trial has increased over time and continues to do so (for example, 10 patients 
were enrolled in both Nove mber and December, 2017 and the total trial enrollment is now 83). 
However,  when calculated at the time of the annual meeting at the end of November 2017, the 
PCORI CER -1503 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 38 average accrual rate , calculated over the entire 19 -month period  of the study , was 6 patients per  
month. Thus,  using the  conservative projection of 6 patients per month over the course of a n 
enrollment extension  ending 12/1/2018, we expect the total number of subjects  to be at least 145 
(73 + 12 x 6).  (73 was the total enrollment when these calculatio ns were made at the end of 
November; however, as noted above, 10 patients were recruited in December.)  
Based on the enrolled 47 patients i n the database with complete data as of 11/28/17 , the average 
cluster size is 2.9. If we assume each center  enroll s 3 more patients over the enrollment extension , 
the average cluster size increases to 5.9. With the current ICC estimate of <0.01 and using the 
original estimates for the complication rates ( 17.8% in PFDD and 2.7% in PFD ), with the projected 
sample size of 14 5, we can still reach 84% power by [CONTACT_485562] [ADDRESS_623813] (DE) concept is used in cluster randomized trials to inflate the 
sample size of the study, compared to the traditional randomized trials [44]. When cluster size is 
fixed, DE = 1 + (m - 1) x ICC; where m is the average cluster size and ICC is the intrac lass 
correlation coefficient. In other words, the sample size of the study can be calculated by [CONTACT_485563], and should be multiplied by [CONTACT_206030]. Under the assumption that m = 6 and ICC = 0.01, 
DE becomes 1.05. To compare 17.8% vs 2.7% surgical comp lication rates for a ( not clustered ) 
randomized trial, with 84% power, and 0.05 type I error rate, we would need to enroll 136 patients 
total. This is also listed in the sample size calculator above under the “unadjusted box”. For a DE 
value of 1.05, this sample size should be multiplied by 1.05 to find the sample size of a cluster 
randomized trial to reach same power. Therefore, the sample size of the clustered randomized trial 
would be 136 x 1.05 = 142.8 ~143.   
 The variable cluster size is common in clu ster randomized trials. Eldridge et al considered the 
effect of variable cluster size on the sample size calculation for cluster randomized trials [45]. 
They showed that the DE value can be calculated for variable class sizes. DE’ = 1 + {(cv2 +1) m -
1} x ICC; where cv is the coefficient of variation of cluster si zes (standard deviation of cluster 
sizes divided by [CONTACT_485564]). The cv is 1.08 for our study. If we use the current average 
cluster size of m = 2.9, DE’ becomes 1.06. In other words, the sample size of the study should be 
inflated to 136 x 1.06  = 144.16~145 to reach 84% power. This assures us that our planned sample 
size of 145 patients will allow us to reach 84% power even if our cluster sizes will not be fixed at 
6.  
It should be noted that, as of March 6th 2018, only [ADDRESS_623814] to follow -
up.  However, to account for a potential 2% loss to follow up on the 145 subjects needed (72 per 
group), we will recruit a minimum of 148 subjects total (74 per group)  and up to 238,  over the 
entire trial enrollment period, which is pr oposed to be extended to December 31, 2018.  
 
 
 Aim 1: Power Calculat ions 
For the purpose of sample size estimation, data from in the Park -Reeves Syringomyelia Research 
Consortium (PRSRC) were analyzed (ambispective enrollment, n=589 subjects with complete 
data); specifically, surgical complications ≤12 months were used to calculate the sample size. In 
PCORI CER -1503 -[ZIP_CODE]  
Version 6 March 01, 2021 
 39 this dataset, surgical complications were noted in 17.8% of PFDD cases and 2.7% of PFD cases.  
This is consistent with reported values from a recent meta -analysis, where the rates for CSF -related 
complications for PFDD and PFD were 18.5% and 1.8%, respectively [27], as we ll data reported 
in case series [17, 25] and a systematic review [42].  We expect to observe a similar difference in 
PFDD versus PFD cases in the proposed study. Because of the clustered randomized nature of the 
trial, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) should be taken into account. The ICC is d efined 
as the proportion of the between cluster (PRSRC center) variation to the total variation. Since the 
cluster sizes are small (6 pe r center), and we have a large number of cent ers available for 
enrollment (4 8 total), the effect of ICC on sample size will be small. Thus, using the PRSRC values 
of 17.8% for PFDD and 2.7% for PFD, and assuming equal number of subjects per group and two -
sided type I error rate of 0.05, to reach 90% power, 36 centers averaging  6 subjects per center will 
be required for the trial assuming the ICC is 0.05. To account for 2% dropout rate, we will recruit 
[ADDRESS_623815]  there is  >500 potential study candidates across 
the 4 8-center network over two years.  
 
 
Aim 2: Non-Inferiority Margins  and Power  
The non-inferiority  margins for this trial were determined in conjunction with a panel of experts 
on CM+SM and related treatment (the Park -Reeves investigators), our non -physician stakeholder 
partners, and our patient partners, Gina Tramelli, Elizabeth O’Keefe , Lisa Reynolds, Sandy Spears, 
Sam Reeves, Dorothy Poppe, and Rich Labuda.  Using a clinical, Delphi -type approach [46] for 
the complex measure of clinical improvement, the research team agreed upon a non -inferiority 
margin of no more than 20% lower response for PFD from the PFDD group.   The clinical 
improvement rate for the PFDD group was provided as 78.6% in the Durham study [27].  Thus, 
with the sample size of  72 subjects per group (after an assumed 2% dropout), we  conclude d non-
inferiority of the PFD to PFDD with a margin of 0. 17 units  (α=0.05, 80% power) . This corresponds 
to clinical improvement rate of 61.6% in the PFD g roup. It was shown in the Durham study that 
the clinical improvement following PFD was 64.6%.

For these calculations , the drop -out rate is assumed to be 2%, and  the one -sided type I error rate is 0.05.  
 
After determination with the Delphi method, the non -inferiority margin was subsequently 
confirmed as appropriate using Rothman’s 95 -95 approach [47, 48] and the FDA guidelines for 
selecting the non -inferiority margin for non -inferiority clinical trials [49].    Using these  method s, 
the non -inferiority margin was est imated using the effect of the standard treatment  (PFDD) from 
Durham’s  meta -analysis  [27], with t he lower 1 -sided 95% confidence inter val for the random -
effects meta -analysis calculated to  be used as a non -inferiority margin.  When the data from the 
PFDD group from t he Durham study was used for the clinical improvement outcome, the 95% 
lower 1 -sided confidence interval  from the random effects model was calculated as 0.611.  In our 
proposal, we defined the non -inferiority margin as the difference between the rates. For  the clinical 
improvement outcome, this corresponds to the non -inferiority margin of 0.786 – 0.611 = 0.[ADDRESS_623816] to clinical improvement, syrinx regression is an objectively measurable and easily 
quantifiable outcome.  It is measured by [CONTACT_485565].  When the effective sample size is 68 subjects per group , and assuming 89.1% syrinx 
regression rate in the PFDD group  [27], the non -inferiority margin is 0. 135 units to reach 81% 
powe r.  A non-inferiority margin of 0.135 units  represents no more than 13.5% reduction from the 
PFDD group in terms of syr inx regression.  Note that  a one -sided type I error rate of 0.05 was 
assumed, and the ‘Two group test of equivalence in proportions’ option in nQuery Advisor was 
used.

For these calculations, the drop -out rate is assumed to be 2%, intra -class correlation coefficient is 0.05, and the one -

Aim 3: Power Calculations  
Based on preliminary data using the  Chiari Health Index in Pediatrics (CHIP) [50], we observed a  
0.12± 0.16 unit imp rovement  in Quality of Life (QOL) scores  following PFDD .  Our sample size 
of 72/group  (effective sample size of 68/group)  will provide 82% power to detect a 0.20± 0.16 unit 
improvement in CHIP  QOL scores following PFD ( α =0.05).  Both from an analytical sta ndpoint 
and from the view of PRSRC investigators and our patient partners, this value represents both a 
significant and meaningful increase in QOL . 
10. DATA COLLECTION  AND QUALITY ASSURAN CE 
10.1 Data Collection Forms   
The DCC will create source documents and disseminate them to all of the participating centers.  
Ultimately, the data on the source documents will be transcribed to an electronic database 
created by [CONTACT_15791].   Similarly, imaging will be uploaded to a separa te electronic platform, the 
Central Neuroimaging Database Archive (CNDA).  This platform is maintained and managed at 
Washington University -St. Louis.  
10.2 Data Management   
The DCC will monitor each site’s data and interpret the respective imaging.  The University  of 
Iowa will oversee the DCC and process data in the following manner:

by [CONTACT_485566] (ACPNF) ) or by [CONTACT_485567] (AOA)  and are either certified or eligible for certification by 
[CONTACT_485541] (ABNS) and the American Board of Pediatric 
Neurological Surgery (ABPNS)  or the American Osteopathic Board of Surgery (AOBS) .  Prior to 
participating in the study, each  pediatric neurosurgeon must  submit documentation veri fying that 
s/he has performed ≥2 0 PFDD/PFD cases at the level of atte nding pediatric neurosurgeon or that 
that s/he performed ≥5 PFDD/PFD cases in the year preceding the participation in the study; and 
3) review two videos showing the study -approved operative technique for PFDD  and PFD in step -
wise fashion.   As detailed in the videos, PFDD and PFD both begin with a midline posterior 
suboccipi[INVESTIGATOR_485476].  Suboccipi[INVESTIGATOR_485468] ± 
cervical laminectomies are performed based upon the level of tonsillar position on the pre -
operative MRI.  The posterior atlanto -occipi[INVESTIGATOR_485477].  For PFD, the operation is complete (dural 
scoring or splitting is permitted), and wound closure is initiated.  For PFDD, the dura is then incised 
and retracted for microsurgical dissection. I ntradural maneuvers are performed at the surgeon’s 
discretion based on the intra -operative findings, but may include exploration/fenestration of an 
arachnoid veil, lysis of adhesions, or tonsillar reduction.  Following the intradural dissection, the 
durapl asty is performed with autologous graft or dural substitute, and the wound is closed in 
standard fashion.  Dural opening without subsequent dural closure is not permitted for PFDD or 
PFD. Periodic quality assurance checks will be performed by [CONTACT_42574] a s ubset of operative notes 
from randomly selected participating surgeons.  
 
The DCC will have a representative train each participating site’s research personnel how to collect 
data on source documents; transcribe them to the electronic database; and instructions on how to 
upload imaging to the Central Neuroimaging Data Archive.  Training will be documented and 
must be completed before access is granted to the respective portal.

 42 10.3.3   Metrics  
Primary Outcome : measured as a binary (yes/no) variable. The presence of any of the following 
items will be considered as a poor outcome (harm to patients):  
o Intra -operative Complication  
 Vascular injury  resulting in dissection or stroke  
 Intracranial  hemorrhage  requiring return to surgery for evacuation  
 Neurological injury ( new cranial nerve deficit,  weakness, sensory loss, 
bowel or bladder dysfunction)

 Hydrocephalus : requires external drainage, shunting, or endoscopic 3rd 
ventriculostomy  
 Infection: clinical diagnosis that may include fever, wound drainage, 
dehiscence, or elevated laboratory parameters in association with antibiotic 
treatment ± surgical debridement.  
 Chemical (or aseptic) meningitis : clinical diagnosis prompting medical 
treatment (e.g. steroids); lumbar puncture and analysis of CSF cell profile 
not required but will be tracked if available.  
 Cervical instability  
 Cerebellar ptosis with intractable headaches  
o Need for surgical procedures for complication management ≤ 12 (+/- 2 mon ths)  
months after initial PFDD or PFD  
 External drainage  for the following:  
 Hydrocephalus  
 CSF leak  
 Pseudomeningocele  
 Infection  
 Shunt malfunction/infection  
 Simple over -sewing of wound for CSF leak  
 Surgical revision in operating room for the following:  
 CSF leak 
 Infection  
 Pseudomeningocele  
 Lumbar puncture and steroids for the following:  
 Chemical meningitis  
 True meningitis

10.3.4  Protocol  Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be reported to the local IRB per the respective institution’s 
guidelines.  
10.3.5  Monitoring  
The DCC  will monitor data quality primarily through the use of remote monitoring 
activities. Remote monitoring involves detailed review of the data entered by [CONTACT_485568]/or research 
assistant/ coordinator to review safety and data q uality. This may require uploading de -
identified copi[INVESTIGATOR_485480], patient study file, regulatory 
documentation, or other source documents to the DCC staff who will review those 
materials against the data recorded in the elect ronic data capture system. This helps assure 
protocol compliance and accurate data collection. The DCC may conduct more remote 
monitoring activities early in the trial to assure protocol compliance and identify any 
training issues that may exist. Safety of  subjects will be monitored and ensured in 
accordance with the DSMB plan. The medical record and study files (including informed 
consent, permission, and assent documents) must be made available to authorized 
representatives of the DCC, upon request, for s ource verification of study documentation. 
In addition, medical information and data generated by [CONTACT_485569].  
11. PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS AND CONFIDEN TIALITY   
Candidates  for participants in the proposed study, “ Posterior Foss Decompression with or 
without Duraplasty for Chiari type I Malformation with Syringomyelia ” are between the 
ages of day -of-life [ADDRESS_623819] stringent guidelines, the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines.  In a multi -institutional study setting, the protection of children becomes more 
complex and involves multiple research institutions with their respective institutional 
review boards (IRBs), the funding agency (PCORI), the data safety monitoring board 
(DSMB), Park-Reeves Syringomyelia Research Consortium (PRSRC) investigators, and 
the PRSRC Research Advisory Board, which will serve as the study steering co mmittee  It 
is paramount that t he PI  [INVESTIGATOR_485481] -[ADDRESS_623820] pediatric subjects and verify that the  study is fully  compliant with all reg ulatory 
and ethical requirements and policies.  
 
Patient partner and mother of a CM+SM patient, Sandy Spears, will serve as a patient 
representative on the study’s Data Safety and Monitoring Board.  In doing so, she will 
help to ensure that the safety and rights of study participants is protected throughout the 
duration of the study.  
  
The DCC will provide training for clinical site investigators and designees regarding study 
procedures and GCP.  The following measures are designed to protect against risk.  
 
Risk due to loss of confidential information  
Risk due to loss of confidential information is mi tigated by [CONTACT_71411].  All 
evaluation forms and reports will be identified only by a coded number to maintain 
patient confidentiality.  All records will b e kept in a locked/password protected 
computer.  Clinical information will not be released without the written permission of 
the parent or legal guardian, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_22866], 
the DCC, or other governmental regulatory b odies.  Specifics pertaining to this study 
for risks due to loss of confidential information are detailed below.  
 
PRSRC Registry E lectronic Database (EDB)  
Data for this study will be entered into the electronic database system maintained by 
[CONTACT_15791] .  The server facility is locked and separately secured from the remainder of 
the DCC.   Its entry and exit access to the building is monitored by [CONTACT_485570], additional 
key codes, and security personnel year round.   The DCC coordinates its network 
infrastruct ure and security with the ITC (Information Technology Center) information 
systems at Washington University -St. Louis.   This provides effective firewall 
hardware, automatic network intrusion detection, and the expertise of dedicated 
security experts working  at the University.   Network equipment includes multiple 
firewalls, routers, and high -speed switches.   User authentication is centralized with four 
Windows 2012R2 domain servers.   Communication over public networks is encrypted 
with virtual point -to-point sessions using secure socket layer (SSL) or virtual private 
network (VPN) technologies.   Both access methods providing at least [ADDRESS_623821] the servers, 
and IT staff is automatically notified of in trusion alerts.   Security is maintained with 
Windows 2012R2 user/group domain -level security.   Users are required to change their 
password every [ADDRESS_623822] signed confidentiality agreements concerning data encountered in the course of 
their daily work.   All personnel (including administrative staff) have received Human 
Subjects Protection and Health Inform ation Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) education.   All users are required to sign specific agreements concerning 
security, confidentiality, and use of our information systems before access is provided.  
 
Centralized Neuroimaging Data Archive (CNDA ) 
The Centralized Neuroimaging Data Archive (CNDA) is an imaging informatics 
platform that provides secure data management services for Washington University – 
St. Louis and collaborating investigators.  The CNDA’s services include automated 
archiving of r esearch imaging studies from all of the University’s scanners, automated 
quality control and image processing routines, and secure web -based access to acquired 
and post -processed data. The CNDA currently stores over 60,000 individual sessions, 
representing  data from a wide range of multi -site and in -house studies.  It also manages 
thousands of non -imaging experiments, including neuropsychological, clinical, 
biomarker, and behavioral data.  The CNDA is built on XNAT [51, 52], a widely used 
open source imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common data 
management and productivity tasks for neuroimaging and associated data. Notable 
features include: 1) support for a range of image upload/download methods, including  
DICOM, web services, and web browsers; 2) an extensible data model that simplifies 
the incorporation of new data types by [CONTACT_485571], user interface components, and search engine plug -ins; 3) quali ty 
control modules and audit trails, including a virtual quarantine that houses uploaded 
data until authorized users have validated them and a complete history profile that 
tracks all changes made to the managed data; 4) a secure web -based user interface f or 
data entry and access; 5) a sophisticated search engine that builds queries across data 
types; 6) an online image viewer that supports a number of common neuroimaging 
formats, including DICOM and Analyze; and 7) a pi[INVESTIGATOR_485482].   
 
The CNDA is widely used to support studies that include geographically dispersed data 
acquisition sites and analysis teams.  Example studies include the Dominantly Inherited 
Alzheimer Network (DIAN), a 15 -site study of inherited Alzheimer’s disease that 
includes PET, MR, neuropsychological, clinical, and tissue data; the Park -Reeves 
Syringomyelia Research Consortium  a [ADDRESS_623823] and CR data; and 
INTRUST, a [ADDRESS_623824] -traumatic stress disorder 
in combat veterans.  Scans are uploaded using a user friendly web -based tool that 
removes identifiers from the image file metadata and transfers the files to th e CNDA 
over an encrypted protocol.  
 
The CNDA implements a number of features and procedures to ensure the security and 
integrity of the data it hosts and full HIPAA compliance. All data coming into and out 
of the CNDA are transmitted over secure channels u sing SSL.  All data are stored on a 
level 5 RAID device with disaster recovery and offsite backup. Snapshots of the 
relational database are taken nightly, enabling reconstruction of the database from any

 46 time point in the study.   Access to study data is r estricted to authorized users who are 
assigned specific access privileges (create, read, edit, delete) according to their role in 
the study.  All logins and access to data are tracked in the internal audit system.  
 
The CNDA offers a number of features to m onitor and maintain the quality of 
acquired data.  As data are uploaded to the system, sequence details (e.g. flip angle, 
repetition time) can be validated against a study specific protocol to ensure that the 
acquisition is compliant. Noncompliant scans ar e flagged in the system for immediate 
follow -up.  Automated image analysis routines are then executed to determine overall 
image quality specific to the acquisition type.  For fMRI, for example, signal to noise 
and subject movement histograms are generated .  The CNDA also supports 
radiological evaluation and manual quality assessments that can be optionally used by 
[CONTACT_315347]. The output from these routines is available to users in web -based reports and 
is flagged when key values fall outside acceptable limits .

patient and family of the rationale and objectives of the study and the risks, benefits, and 
alternatives to participation, written informed consent will be obtained from a parent or 
legal guardian (patient <18 years of age) or the pati ent themselves (patient ≥18 years of 
age).  Additionally, assent will be obtained for patients of appropriate age, according to 
individual institutional practices.  If study participation is declined, then all clinical care 
will be provided to the child in  accordance with institutional practice and judgment.   
11.[ADDRESS_623826]. Louis , we will maintain a key with the de -
identification and coding information in a locked office.  
 
All rec ords related to a participant’s  research will be stor ed in locked f iling cabine ts or on 
comput ers protected with p asswo rds. The participant’s  identi ty on these records will be 
indicated by  a case  numb er rather than by n ame, and the informati on linking these case 
numbers with the participant’s  identity will be kept separate from the re search records. The 
participant will not be ide ntified by [CONTACT_485573]. 
 
All data collected will be entered into the PRSRC Registry Electronic Database (EDB ). 
This EDB was created in [ADDRESS_623827] demonstrate IRB approval by [CONTACT_485574]/confidentiality module.  A coded, limited  data set may then be entered, 
with the key to the code maintained at each collaborating site. This information will only 
be kept onsite at each institution and will only be available to key personnel of this study, 
data monitors and IRB officials as needed. At the conc lusion of the study, the de -identified 
data will be retained indefinitely by [CONTACT_941] P.I. The data with PHI will be destroyed at the 
conclusion of the study. The PRSRC, PCORI, this institution, the Principal Investigator , 
and his /her staff will comply with any  and all laws regarding the privacy of such 
information.  
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_079], David Limbrick, 
MD, PhD; the IRB,  the OHRP, the FDA, or other government agencies as part of their

the PRSRC will convene a consensus conference to discuss the results and their implications for 
clinical practice and patient education, and to draft evidenced -based guidelines for the surgical 
treatment of CM+SM.  
 
A data sharing procedure  has been developed by [CONTACT_485575].   All code books, statistical 
programming code, and a  cleaned, de -identified copy of the final data set will be made avail able to 
other researchers if requested within [ADDRESS_623828].  Researchers requesting acc ess to the data will be directed to the Washington 
University Chiari website ( https://chiari.wustl.edu )  where a description of the available data and the 
data release policy will be posted.   The researchers will th en submit a short propos al (no more than 5 
pages) to [CONTACT_485580],  principal investigator.   This proposal would then be reviewed by [CONTACT_978], the 
research team and patient partners.   If there are concerns about confidentiality arising from the project, 
data will not be released.   Assuming that confidentiality can be maintained, the committee will make 
every effort to sh are data and will only deny  requests under the following conditions:  
1. The central purpose of the study is not research or evaluation.  
2. The  research goals are not feasible using the current study data.  
3. The proposed research involves data that may compromise the privacy or confidentiality of 
individuals, providers or institutions.  
4. The data processing necessary to produce the requested fi les places an unusually heavy burden 
on the data processing staff.  
5. The requestors have not demonstrated the necessary experience and expertise required to carry 
out the  proposed research.  
 
If there are specific concerns raised during the review process,  the reviewer’s comments will be sent 
to the requestor and the requestor will be given the opportunity to respond to these comments and 
resubmit his/her proposal. Any manuscripts or publications that result from the use of PRSRC data by 
[CONTACT_485576] s will be reviewed by [CONTACT_485577].   This last review is not intended for scientific purposes, only to protect confidentiality.

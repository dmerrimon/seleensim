Use of Clobazam in Treating Anxiety Comorbid with Pediatric Epi[INVESTIGATOR_821051] [ADDRESS_1138150]  
 
Certain mood stabilizer/anticonvulsant medications may be better suited for 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_821053]. Many anticonvulsants are broad -
spectrum and are well established as improving outcome for epi[INVESTIGATOR_821054].  The intuitiv e choice for treatment in patients with such 
comorbidity would be medications with an established track record in 
successfully treating both conditions independently.   Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_215159] a 
mainstay of anxiety treatment as well as for epi[INVESTIGATOR_32566].   
 
Given its unique molecular structure, clobazam ( Onfi®) is an example of a 
medication that theoretically could serve a “dual role” in terms of treating epi[INVESTIGATOR_821055].  Anxiety is prominent in children and adolescents 
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] a lthough the evidence base is underdeveloped.   
 
This study would assess the utility of clobazam , which may represent a more 
effective and better tolerated treatment option for the numerous patients with 
seizure disorders who also have anxiety.  This study is an investigator initiated 
proposal submitted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_821056] a prospective open -label clinical trial of [ADDRESS_1138151] and pre-screening is completed, the screening  
study visit will be scheduled.  At that visit, study details will be reviewed and 
informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_978].  The screening  study visit will 
include detailed medical and psychiatric history review, pertinent, physical 
examination  (vital signs, neurologic exam) , and assessment including semi -
structured diagnostic interviews and rating scales . 
 
Following the screening visit, participants who qualify and continue consent will 
enter into the active treatment phase of the study.   The initial treatment phase 
will begin with a dispensing visit.  It is expected that the dispensing visit may 
occur on the same day as the screening visit.  However, if it does not occur on 
the day of the screening visit, it  may occur within two weeks of the screening 
visit.   
 
Continued c ontact with research participants will be done at regular  intervals over 
a period of approximately [ADDRESS_1138152].   
 
Inclusion criteria:

will have active epi[INVESTIGATOR_821057] .

be established in the [ADDRESS_1138153] been stable for 30 days 
prior to entry into the study.  
 No epi[INVESTIGATOR_821058] 30 days prior to 
entry into the study.

appropriately consent for study procedures  
  
 
Statistic al Analysi s Plan  
 
Change from baseline will be analyzed statistically to test the main study 
hypotheses --that Onfi® has a dual role of improving both behavioral/psychiatric 
status, namely anxiety symptoms, as well as seizure control, in patients with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  
 
Outcome measures will encompass behavioral and neurologic status.  The 
primary outcome variable will be Clin ical Global Assessment of Functioning 
Improvement from baseline.  CGI ratings will be attributed both to neurological 
status including seizure control, as well as behavioral status.  CGI -Improvement 
ratings of a 1 or 2 (on a 7 point scale) will be consider ed positive responses.  
Paired student’s t -tests will be used to compare baseline and study endpoint 
ratings for response versus non -response.

 Secondary outcome measures will include changes from baseline in overall and 
subscale ratings of the Pediatric  Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS), Multidimensional 
Anxiety Scale (MASC), and the Quality of Life in Epi[INVESTIGATOR_379742].   Positive 
outcomes will be defined as 10% score reduction or scores that drop below 
threshold of clinical significance.  Paired student’s t -tests will be used to compare 
baseline and study end outcomes for each measure.   
 
Risks  
 
The clearest risk is of potential side effects or other adverse effects of clobazam 
(Onfi®) drug treatment.  Clobazam is a widely available anticonvulsant medicine 
with FDA indication for seizures associated with Lennox Gastaut Syndrome in 
pediatrics.  All participants will have active epi[INVESTIGATOR_821061], so the risks incurred with drug treatment are equivalent 
to that experienced in typi[INVESTIGATOR_821062] .  Close clinical 
monitoring and active side effect and adverse event monitoring at each contact [CONTACT_821066] g side effect.  
Specific risks  notable for  clobazam include rare but serious skin reactions, called 
Stevens -Johnson and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194].  The skin reaction is very rare, but 
more likely to occur within the first [ADDRESS_1138155] 
with participants to address this potential adverse reaction.   
Clobazam may slow thinking and impair moto r skills; so participants will be 
cautioned not to drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in other dangerous 
activities until they know how the drug affects them. Given its structural similarity to 
other benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], clobazam can also theoretically cause abuse and 
dependence. It has been categorized as a Schedule IV drug under the Controlled 
Substances Act , and thus should not be discontinued suddenly . Onfi should not be 
discontinued suddenly. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_821063], such as seizures that will not stop, hallucinations, shaking, nervousness, 
and stomach or muscle cramps.   
Questions about medical and psychiatric history reveal private information, so there 
is a risk concerning confidentiality. The information ga thered on the questionnaires 
will only be identified by a subject number and will be kept in a locked file cabinet in 
a locked office, or in a password protected computer.   
Some questions might make children or parents think about things that are anxiety 
provoking  or uncomfortable.  In our experience, these reactions are mild and pass 
Use of Clobazam in Treating Anxiety Comorbid with Pediatric Epi[INVESTIGATOR_821051] [ADDRESS_1138156] improvement in seizure control and/or anxiety symptoms.  
Participation in the study may also contribute to a better understanding of the 
treatment effects of anxiety comorbid with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  Individual participants have 
reasonable potential to have improvement in their disease conditions as a result 
of participation in this study.     
 
Participation in this study will also lead to increased knowledge base in the field 
and increased understanding of treatment options for children and adolescents 
with anxiety comorbid with pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].   
 
We will be happy to share results of standardi zed questionnaires, etc. with 
parents when the results are available.  This may be very useful to subjects and 
their clinicians ; however, we are clear to state that participation in this study 
should not be considered as a substitute for a formal mental he alth evaluation.  
 
 
Payment and Remuneration  
 
Study participants will not be paid for participating in this study.   
 
Costs  
 
There are no direct costs for participating in this study.  Neither the patient, nor 
their insurance provider, will be charged for t he costs of any of the procedures 
performed exclusively for the purpose of this research study.  The patient and/or 
insurer will be billed for routine medical care services, or services not connected 
with the study. They will be responsible for any applica ble copays, coinsurances 
and deductibles.   
 
Routine clinical care will continue with the participants  usual neurologists and 
primary care providers.  If additional assessments including lab tests are 
necessary for clinical care purposes, these will be done outside of the context of 
this study.  
 
Study medication will be provided to the participants at no charge for the duration 
of the study.  Efforts will be made to continue treatment based upon clinical 
justification and in collaboration with the participant’s clinical treatment team.

Confidentiality  
 
Any information about the parent, child or their family obtained from this research 
will be kept as confidential (private) as possible.  All records related to them or 
their child’s involvement in this research study will be stored either in a password 
protected computer or in a locked fil e cabinet stored in a locked office. The 
patient’s identity on these records will be indicated by a case number rather than 
by a name, and the information linking these case numbers with an identity will 
be kept separate from the research records. Neither the parent nor child will be 
identified by [CONTACT_821068] a separate form 
giving us their permission (release) is signed.  Any data communicated to 
coordinating or collaborating sites will be fully de -identified, e.g. ag e in years, 
gender, etc., such that information cannot be personally linked to an individual 
subject.

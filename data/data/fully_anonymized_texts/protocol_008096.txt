1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEM A 
 
This is a prospect ive study examining the utility of minimally invasive percutaneous 
peritoneal lavage for rapid gastric and panc reas cancer  staging. The first aim of this study 
will be to evaluate whether results of percutaneo us lavage are concordant with those  of 
laparoscop ically guided lavage. The second ary endpoi nt of this study will be to examine 
the safety of this techn ique. 
 
Patient popul ation: All patients with gastric or pancreatic cancer who currently unde rgo 
laparoscop ic guided peritoneal lavage and cytology. 
 
Design: Percutaneous  lavage will be performed via a catheter placed  over a  wire prior to 
the standar d laparoscop ic lavage. The two techn iques will be compared by [CONTACT_390794]. 
 
Time to completion: We will con tinue to enroll patients to meet two requirements: a total of 
at least [ADDRESS_490409] 10 gastric cancer patients with positive lavage 
(percutantous or laparoscopic) and 10 pancreas cancer  patients with positive lavage 
(percutantous or laparoscopic) . This will likely take 18 months.

2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS 
 
Hypothesis: Percutaneous peritoneal  lavage will yield results that are concordant with 
laparoscop ically guided lavage. 
Primary Objective: To determine if the cytology results from percutaneo us peritoneal lavage are in 
conco rdance  with the cytology from laparoscop ically guided peritoneal lavage. 
Secondar y Objective: Percutaneous  peritoneal lavage is a safe technique to utilize in place of 
laparoscop ic lavage.

cytology (8 months vs. 16 months p<.001).9 Currently, patients are diagnosed  with gastric 
 
cancer  by [CONTACT_390795] c ultrasound  at a subsequent visit. After 
ultrasound staging, patients undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage. If 
there is no gross disease  and the lavage is negative, then patients unde rgo a gastrectomy 
(either be fore or after chemotherapy). Patients with pancreas cancer ar e diagnosed via CT 
scan  and proceed to the operating room if the disease  appear s to be resectable or are 
offered participation in clinical trials of neoad juvant therapy. Staging laparoscopy is 
frequently performed to rule out sub-radiologic metastatic disease. Given the need  for 
improved operating room utilization, for decr eased  healthcare expendi ture, and possibility 
of decreasing time to treatment, we hypothesize that rapid staging can be performed with 
percutaneous  peritoneal  lavage. This protocol will evaluate the equivalence of 
percutaneous  and laparoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_390787]. It will also determine the safety of using 
a percutaneous  techn ique. The results from this study will serve as preliminary data to 
utilize percutaneous  lavage at the time of EUS or in a monitored setting outside of the 
operating room. This could chan ge standa rd practice patterns. In the future, patients with 
gastric or panc reas cancer could undergo percutaneous  washings at the time of EUS. If 
the lavage is positive, those patients would avoid laparoscopy  and could proceed  directly 
to palliative treatment. If the lavage is negative, patients would go to the OR for 
laparoscopy and resection at the same setting if no gross disease is identified. 
 
 
 
 
Backg round and Significance:  
 
 
Gastric cancer 
 
 
Loco regional recurrences are common following curative resection of gastric cancer.  D’Angelica 
et al reported on patterns of recurrence among 1172 patients who unde rwent gastric resections 8. 
Of the 42% patients who recurred, 26% recurred locoregionally; 16% were distant and 
locoregional, 14%  were peritoneal onl y, and 9% were locoregional onl y. Since intraabd ominal 
recurrence  is a common site for metastatic spread of gastric cancer, peritoneal lavage has been 
utilized at the time of diagnostic laparoscopy  to assist in identifying patients with microscopi c 
peritoneal di sease.  
 
 
Several studies have shown that laparoscopy can be used 
to identify patients with gastric cancer who have

radiographically occult metastatic disease. Brennan reported on 111 patients who were 
 
candi dates for resection where 32/[ADDRESS_490411] M1 disease at the time of laparoscopy;  
 
72% of M1 disease  involved the abdominal peritoneum  3. Burke showed that 33/127 patients 
(26%) who were cand idates for resection had positive cytology 2. Overall, 3 of the 33 resected 
patients who were stage III had positive cytology. In Burke’s study, survival was significantly 
worse than those with cytology negative stage III disease. Of the 51 patients with M1 disease  on 
laparoscopy 30 had positive cytology (59%). With macroscopic M1 disease,  73% of patients had 
positive cytology in all quadrants (Figure 1). 
 
 
Badgwell looked at 381  patients with gastric or GE junction tumors that were thought to be 
resec table, who unde rwent diagnostic laparoscopy and lavage prior to neoadjuvant chemo. 
Survival was dramatically inferior in the patients with positive cytology. (Figure 2).[ADDRESS_490412] peritoneal  mets on laparoscop y, 13% had positive lavage 
with no peritoneal di sease, and 75% had negative lavage. There was no significant difference 
between median overall survival in patients with positive peritoneal c ytology and no visible 
metastatic disease  and patients with gross metastatic disease (11.6 months vs. 10. months, 
p=.06) (Figure 3).

The importance of identifying patients with M1 disease is that these patients are treated with 
chemotherapy instead of resection. There are randomized trials that ha ve shown response  rates 
between 49 and 56% with the ECF regimen for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer.10 
Cunningham reported the results of the MAGIC trial in the NEJM in 2006.7 They found  that for 
 
patients with resectable gastric or GE junction adenoca rcinoma neoadj uvant epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], cisplatin, 
and fluorouracil improved survival. In both the MAGIC trial and INT 0116  trial, overall 5-year 
survival for all resected patients was less than 30%, desp ite improvements with neoad juvant 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[ADDRESS_490415] popul ation, which is where staging with peritoneal  lavage is useful. Yonemura treated 
61 patients with neoadj uvant intraperitoneal and  systemic chemo in patients with peritoneal 
disease.24 Of the 39 patients with positive cytology at the beginning of treatment, only 17 patients 
had positive lavage at the completion of treatment. Another regimen described by [CONTACT_390797] a 
phase II trial is neoadj uvant cisplatin-5FU with postoperative IP floxuridine/leucovo rin for T2N1 or 
T3-4 disease.4 
 
Pancreatic cancer  
 
 
Approximately 20-30% of patients with radiologically resectable disease  pancreas cancer ha ve M1 
disease identified on laparoscop y. 6 Ferrone looked at 462 patients who had radiographically 
resec table panc reas cancer and unde rwent diagnostic laparoscopy  and cytology.9 Overall positive 
cytology rate was 17% and it was reported most frequently in the setting of macroscopic 
peritoneal di sease.  In pancreas cance r, the data correlating cytology results to survival are not as 
convincing as it is in gastric cancer, although current AJCC Staging characterizes patients with 
positive peritoneal c ytology as Stage IV. Yamada examined 157 patients who had curative 
resec tions and found  that in resected patients the median survival was equal bet ween patients 
with positive and negative cytology (13.6 and 13.5 months).[ADDRESS_490416] median survival in patients 
with locally advanced or distant metastatic 
disease.  However, among patients undergoing 
panc reatic resection, the 5% of patients with 
positive cytology had a significantly worse 
overall survival when compared to patients who 
were resected with negative cytology (8 vs. 16 Figure  4

 months, p<.001). It is this group of patients that would bene fit from earlier less invasive diagnosis 
 
of positive peritoneal cytology. 
 
 
 
 
 
Percutaneous  peritoneal  lavage is well establish ed in trauma 
 
 
This protocol aims to assess the utility of percutaneous  peritoneal  lavage to obtain the specimens. 
Percutaneous  peritoneal  lavage has been  performed for many years in the trauma setting. While 
originally done  with a surgical cutdown to the fascia with direct insertion of the lavage catheter, 
percutaneous  techn iques have been  validated. Saunde rs prospe ctively random ized 176 blunt 
trauma patients requiring diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) to open vs. percutaneous  DPL with 
Veress needl es and a 9Fr catheter.19 He reported a shorter (2.73 minutes) procedur e with the 
percutaneous  procedure, no false-negatives, 1 false positive in each group, and 11% of 
percutaneous  DPLs had <200mL return of the 1000mL instilled. Cue randomized [ADDRESS_490417] and reported equal results between the two 
groups .20 Hodgson performed a meta-analysis and found percutaneous  and open had similar 
accu racy and complications.12 Nagy reported a .8% complication rate, which was similar between 
the open  and percutaneous group in a series with over [ADDRESS_490418]  in a similar 
fashion, cons istent with M1 disease.  
 
Our long-term goal is to make gastric and pancreas cancer staging more efficient. Currently, 
lavage is performed at the time of diagnostic laparoscopy  or resection. If lavage is positive, 
patients are treated with chemotherapy and may be reevaluated for resection after completion of 
their treatment regimen. We hypothesize that per itoneal lavage using the diagnostic peritoneal 
lavage techni que will be concor dant to laparoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_390787]. This techn ique has been

 accu rate. In the future, utilizing ambulatory lavage at the time of endoscop ic ultrasound will ass ist 
 
in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_390788] y. If percutaneous  lavage at the 
time of EUS is negative, pa tients will go to the operating room with the definitive plan of 
laparoscopy to rule out gross M1 disease  and resection. Ten to 30% of these patients shoul d 
have  positive lavage. This is based on results from 3 paper s: 
 
• Burke5: 26% of all potentially resectable patients + cytology 
 
• Bentrem3: 10% of T3/T4 patients without visible disease  +cytology 
 
• Badgwell2: 15% of potentially resec table patients with no visible M1 disease  had + 
 
cytology; of the 22% with visible M1 disease,  50% of them had positive cytology 
 
 
 
 
This project is innovative because  it will adapt  a procedu re that has effectively been  used in 
trauma surgery to detect gastric and pancreas cancer cells present in peritoneal lavages. This 
study fits into the overall resea rch goals of the department of surgery at MSKCC because  it will 
deve lop a diagnostic tool that is minimally invasive and can be used in the CIGI suite when it is 
established.  
 
  
 
Future Directions 
 
 
This protocol is important because if it proves that percutaneous  lavage is a viable staging test, it 
may change how patients with gastric and pancreatic cancer are staged. It cou ld enabl e patients 
to undergo more efficient com plete staging in one-step with EGD/EUS and  peritoneal eva luation. 
Althoug h not pa rt of the present p roposal , it sho uld allow the technique to be used in a monitored 
setting, with anes thesia personnel pr esent and  pre-proced ure labs evaluated. The percutaneous 
lavage will be performed after the EUS, in order to avoid distorting the EUS imaging. 
 
In gastric cancer , among patients felt to be resectable by [CONTACT_390798], laparoscopy  will 
identify 20-30% of patients with M1 disease. Of this 20-30% of patients, 75% will have positive 
cytology. If positive cytology is identified by [CONTACT_390799], then it would avoid laparoscopy  in 15-22% of 
patients felt to be operable based on imaging. Similar to patients with gastric cance r, 
approximately 20-30% of patients with radiologically resec table panc reas cancer  have M1 
disease identified on laparoscop y. Of this 20-30%, 50%  of these patients will have positive 
cytology, so 10-15% of patients felt to be operable based on imaging will have positive cytology

4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY  DESIGN/INT ERVENTION  
 
4.1 Design 
 
Patients with gastric cancer  or pancreatic cancer who require diagnostic laparoscopy will be 
identified and offered enrollment in this trial. If they consen t, they would under go a percutaneous 
lavage for cytology in the OR, followed by [CONTACT_390800]. The concordance  
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTER ING  CANCER CENTER 
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 10-011 A(4) 
Amended: [ADDRESS_490419] 10 
patients with positive cytology from either gastric or pancreas cancer will be required so that there 
are enough data on each disease  to show  equivalence. It is highly unlikely that concor dance will 
be disease  specific, as theoretically there is no difference between sampling fluid with a 
laparoscop ic suction device or a catheter inserted directly into the abdom en. The significance of 
positive cells may differ between the two diseases,  but the techni cal diagnosis of cancer ce lls in 
peritoneal  fluid is the same between the two diseases.  Pancreas and gastric cancer patients are 
included together in this study, because it is testing a techni que that is not cancer spec ific, and 
patients with both diseases potentially benef it from this techn ique in the future. It is estimated that 
approximately 50% of patients accrued for the study will have gastric cancer and 50% panc reas 
cance r. Ten to 30% of these patients shou ld have positive lavage. Excess lavage fluid may be 
retained for pot ential future use under IRB #00-032. 
 
The percutaneous  lavage cytology results will be compared to those of traditional laparoscop ically 
directed lavage. If the results of the percutaneou s lavage are positive more often than 
laparoscop ically guided, it is theoretically poss ible that the percutaneous lavage diluted the 
laparoscop ic lavage or removed the only positive cells in the peritoneum . This event is extremely 
unlike ly, as when one laparoscop ic lavage is positive, generally all spec imens are positive. For 
clinical dec ision making, it does  not matter where the positive cells come from or by [CONTACT_390801]: any  positive cells, from any  quadrant or obt ained with any method, represents 
a positive lavage. With this protocol, a finding of positive percutaneous  lavage and negative 
laparoscop ic lavage will be treated as a positive lavage for clinical dec ision making, and the 
patient will be referred for appropriate therapy. This provides patients with the appropriate clinical 
treatment, because  positive cells obtained via percutaneous  or laparoscopic lavage fluid all 
represent the same tumor biology, and  it does  not matter what method of introduc ing and 
extracting this fluid from the abdom en is used. For the purposes  of experimental des ign in this 
study comparing percutaneous  to laparoscopi c lavage in this study, if the percutaneous  method is 
positive and the laparoscopic lavage is negative, this will be treated as a “false positive.” Thus, in 
the hypothetical situation, which we belie ve is a theoretical but unlikely poss ibility, where a patient 
who has a positive percutaneous  lavage with a negative laparoscop ic lavage: 
 
1.  Clinically, patients will be treated with whatever regimen is considered appropriate for 
a patient with a positive lavage

Amended: 19 -Nov-2015  
Page  12 of 23  
 2.  Experimentally, for this study comparing percutaneous  and laparoscop ic lavage, this 
 
patient will be labelled as having a “false positive” test, as in this study attempting to 
prove equivalence between two techni ques, laparoscop ic lavage will be considered the 
true positive. 
 
The presence  of any positive cells will define a patient as positive, regardless of the number of 
positive cells. 
 
 
 
 
Secondar y objective: 
 
The safety of using percutaneous  lavage will be evaluated as a seconda ry objective. This will 
entail an examination and reporting of all potential complications related to using the 
percutaneous  catheter. 
 
 
The protocol will be suspended and reviewed if: 
 
• Four serious adverse events occur (as described in 8.0). 
 
• After the first 16  positive laparoscop ic lavages, 13  or less of the percutaneous lavages are 
positive. 
 
 
 
4.2 Intervention 
 
Diagnostic peritoneal lavage will be performed at the time of laparoscopy  utilizing a Veress 
needl e/Seldinger techn ique to insert a peritoneal  dialysis catheter. This is not a new 
techni que. The Veress needle will be inserted in the abdom inal wall, at a site to be left up to the 
individual sur geon. Caudal traction will be applied to the abdom inal wall to 
provide a firm abdo minal wall to insert the needl e through, minimizing the peritoneum  from 
tenting down closer to visceral structures. Intraperitoneal pl acement of the catheter will be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_390802] e with no resistance and with the saline in 
the hub of the needl e falling into the peritoneal c avity spon taneous ly. Three passes  with 
the needl e will be allowed, after which an unco nfirmed needl e placement will cause 
cessa tion of the procedu re. Patients who have a failed lavage will not be included  in the 
95 patients required for the study, but w ill be documented as a failed lavage, and this 
number will be reported with the final study results. A guide wire will be placed  through the 
Veress and utilizing the Seldinger techn ique, a 9Fr peritoneal c atheter will be placed.

The primary objective is to determine if percutaneous lavage and laparoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_390791]. The outcome of the lavage 
tests examined for each  patient will be binary: positive or negative (susp icious cytology will be 
treated as positive, consistent with current practice). We will  test the null hypothesis that the 
conco rdance  is at least 80% using a two-stage design distinguishing between 80% and 90% with 
Type I and Type II errors of 10%. 80% was chosen as a reason able percentage, because  in the 
future, the percutaneous  lavage will be used  at the time of endoscopy, a nd if it is falsely negative, 
patients will proceed  to laparoscopy  as is the current pr actice, and will be afforded all appropriate 
treatment options. We will enroll [ADDRESS_490423] stage, we will enroll 58 
more patients (for a total of 95). We will con tinue to enroll patients to meet two requirements: a 
total of at least [ADDRESS_490424] 10 patients with positive lavage and gastric cancer and 10 
patients with positive lavage and pancreas cancer. If the two tests agree in 80 or more patients 
out of 95, we will recommend percutaneou s lavage for further s tudy.

 • After the first [ADDRESS_490425] that is utilized for clinical dec isions, and equivalence 
will be defined as similar cytological results between the percutaneous  and laparoscop ic lavage 
groups.  
 
The seconda ry objective is to determine the safety of the patients under going percutaneous 
lavage. This will be reported with a 95% confidence interval. Safety will be measur ed as number 
of bowel injury, major omental injury, or major abdominal vessel or  anterior abdom inal wall 
vessel injury. 
 
 
 
 
Limitations: 
 
There is a very small risk that instilling fluid percutaneous ly prior to conventional laparoscop ically 
guided lavage will dilute the laparoscopi c lavage and artificially improve the results of 
percutaneous  lavage. Given that 800cc will be instilled and less than 60cc will be withdrawn for 
the percutaneo us portion, any residual fluid in the LUQ will be utilized for the LUQ laparoscopi c 
lavage. It is likely that no additional fluid will have to be instilled into the abdomen, but i f there is 
not enou gh fluid left over from the percutaneous  lavage, then additional fluid will be instilled 
laparoscop ically. If the laparoscopi c lavage is negative and the percutaneo us lavage is positive, it 
is poss ible this discrepancy is due to a dilutional effect, and  this will be treated as a “false 
positive” result. Clinically, this indicates that percutaneous  lavage can identify disease  when 
present , and the positive result will be used  to initiate appropriate systemic treatment. This is the 
same as having lavage positive in one quadrant and all other quadrants negative. It does  not 
matter where the positive cells come from or by [CONTACT_390804]. Any positive 
cells, from any  quadrant or obtained with any method, represent positive lavage clinically. 
Another limitation is that visual d isease  will not be identified. Currently, patients undergo staging 
laparoscopy and lavage, so both visual and microscopic disease  is identified. In this protocol, 
since percutaneous  and laparoscopi c lavage are both performed at the same setting, this remains 
unchang ed. If this protocol p roves that percutaneous and laparoscopic lavage are equivalent with 
regard to cytology status, and the next study examines utilizing percutaneous lavage at the time 
of EUS, visible disease would be missed in cases with positive peritoneal c ytology. As discussed 
in the backg round data, this is the point of peritoneal c ytology – positive cytology is equivalent to

 M1 disease;  those  patients with positive cytology by [CONTACT_390805] y. Those patients with negative cytology will 
unde rgo routine staging laparoscopy to rule out visible sub-radiologic disease, and either proceed 
to immediate resection, or go on to appropriate neoadj uvant therapy. In the presence of negative 
cytology but visible sub-radiologic disease, appr opriate pallia tive treatment will be offered. Finally, 
patients who have a failed lavage will not  be included in the 95 patients required for  the study, 
but will be docum ented as a failed lavage, and  this number will be reported with the final study 
results.

 Weekly registration reports will be generated to monitor patient acc ruals and 
 
completeness  of registration data.  Routine data quality reports will be generated to 
assess missing data and incons istencies.  Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of 
evaluations and follow-up will be monitored periodically throughout the study period and 
potential problems will be brought to the attention of the study team for discuss ion and 
action 
Random -sample data quality and protocol compliance audits will be conducted by [CONTACT_58860], at a  minimum of  two times per year, more frequently if indicated. 
 
 
 
 
 
13.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by [CONTACT_30589] 2001.  The plans address 
the new polici es set forth by [CONTACT_30590] “Policy of the National 
Cancer Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index .html.  The DSM Plans at MSKCC 
were established  and are monitored by [CONTACT_166996]. The MSKCC Data 
and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://mskweb5.msk cc.org/intranet/_assets/_tables/content/359709/ DSMPlans07. pdf 
 
 
There are several different mechani sms by [CONTACT_30592], 
safety and quality.  There are institutional p rocesses in place for quality assurance  (e.g., 
protocol monitoring, com pliance  and data verification audits, therapeut ic response,  and 
staff education on clinical resea rch QA) and  departmental proced ures for quality control, 
plus there are two institutional commit tees that are respons ible for monitoring the activities 
of our clinical trials programs. The committees:  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) for Phase  I and  II clinical trials, and  the Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the Center’s Research Counc il and 
 
Institutional Review Board. 
  
During the protocol deve lopment and  review process,  each protocol will be assessed  for 
it’s level of  risk and degree of monitoring required.  Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH 
sponsor ed, in-house  sponsored, indus trial spons ored, NCI coop erative group, etc.) will be

exam with the scope. The patient will not  be paid for taking part in this study. 
 
 
The poss ible complications include: 
 
 
Likely  
 
• Mild discomfort at the needle insertion site. The tube used  is similar in size to a 
large intravenous  line like the one that gets placed in veins in the arm. 
 
 Less  Likely 
 
• There is a chance that putting fluid in with this study will dilute the traditional 
laparoscop ic lavage and falsely make the laparoscopic lavage negative. If this 
happens,  a positive result from the percutaneous  test will be cons idered overall 
positive. 
Rare but s erious 
 
• Bowel injury. We know  from large resear ch studies that the risk of injuring the 
bowels is about 0. 18%. 
• Major abdom inal vessel  or abdo minal wall vessel injury. We know from large 
resea rch studies that the risk of these injuries is about 0.09% 
• If there is a serious bowel injury or major abdominal vessel  injury that is not 
recognized, or that can not be repaired, there also is a very small risk of death. 
 
 
Protection of human subjects from the above complications will include preoper ative evaluation 
by [CONTACT_390807], preoper ative laboratories, placement of the percutaneous catheter into a site to 
be selected by [CONTACT_390808], caudal  traction on the skin to 
increase  abdo minal wall tension to minimize under lying visceral injury, and laparoscopy

Rationale  
 
The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a non -profit research and 
educational organizatio n working as a clinical trial sponsor to obtain approval for the prescription 
use of 3,4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as an adjunct to psychotherapy in patients 
with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that  negatively 
impacts a person’s daily life, and can result in diminished cognitive and psychosocial functioning, 
fractured relationships, inability to maintain employment, substance abuse, high -cost healthcare 
utilization, increased depression, and suicide risk. People who suffer from PTSD relive their 
traumatic experience(s) through nightmares and flashbacks, have difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and feel 
detached or estranged. Symptoms can be severe and long lasting.  
 
MDMA is a monoamine releaser and re -uptake inhibit or with indirect effects on neurohormone 
release. The combined neurobiological effects reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, 
enhance communication and introspection, and increase empathy and compassion. MDMA may 
enhance fear extinction learning in humans. The subjective effects of MDMA create a productive 
psychological state that enhances the therapeutic process. Data from an international series of 
Phase [ADDRESS_1062558] severe PTSD. A flexible dose of MDMA hydrochloride salt (referred to as MDMA 
throughout) or placebo, followed by a supplemental half -dose unless contraindicated, is 
administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in th ree blinded 
monthly Experimental Sessions. This ~12 -week Treatment Period is preceded by [CONTACT_590410]. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by 
[CONTACT_120547] -drug psychotherapy. Experimental Se ssions are followed by [CONTACT_590429]; a sub -study ( Appendix A ) will assess feasibility of Experimental Sessions without 
an overnight stay. The Primary Outcome measure, the change in Clinician Administered PTSD 
Scale (CAPS -5) from Baseline (Visit 3), is assessed by a blinded centralized Independent Rater 
(IR) pool at  [ADDRESS_1062559] Baseline (Visit 19). The CAPS -5 is also administered as an 
exploratory measure after Treatments 1 and 2 (Visits 8 and 13). The IR pool will be blinded to 
visit number and number of treatments received and will not have access to data collect ed by [CONTACT_773749].  
 
The study will be conducted in N≈100 participants, randomized with a 1:1 allocation to Group 1: 
MDMA -assisted psychotherapy or Group 2: placebo with psychotherapy, with a planned interim 
analysis for sample size re -estimation by [CONTACT_23275] (DMC) 
after [ADDRESS_1062560] 60% of participants have completed their final 
CAPS -5 assessment and terminated treatment. Prior to this study, there will be separate open -

• Screening Period : phone screen, informed consent, eligibility assessment, and 
enrollment of eligible participants  
• Preparatory Period with Enrollment Confirmation : medication tap ering, Preparatory 
Sessions and Baseline assessments leading to Enrollment Confirmation  
• Treatment Period : three monthly Experimental Sessions and associated Integrative 
Sessions over ~12 weeks plus two CAPS -5 assessments  
• Follow -up Period and Study Terminat ion: 4 weeks with no study visits, followed by 
[CONTACT_120550] -5 and Study Termination visit  
• Invitation to participate in Long -term Follow -up (LTFU) extension study : [ADDRESS_1062562] in an open -
label safety extension study to receive treatment with the same method of MDMA -assisted 
psychotherapy as in the initial study. Data will be included in the sponsor’s overall safety 
database.

Protocol Objective  
 
The overall objective of this study is to use standard clinical measures to confirm the efficacy and 
safety of manualized MDMA -assisted psychotherapy with a flexible dose of MDMA in reducing 
PTSD and associated symptoms in comparison to the same psychotherapy combined with an 
inactive placebo control.  
 
Primary Objective  
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy 
for PTSD compared to the identical psychotherapy with inactive placebo, based on comparison of 
CAP S-5 Total Severity Score at Visit 3 (Baseline) to Visit 19 ([ADDRESS_1062579] Baseline).  
 
Secondary Objective  
 
The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of MDMA -assisted 
psychotherapy for PTSD compared with identical psychotherapy with inactive placebo in 
clinician -rated functional impairment, as measured by [CONTACT_120554] (SDS) item scores from Visit 3 (Baseline) to Visit 19 ([ADDRESS_1062580] Baseline).

Page 8 of 104 Safety Objectives  
 
The overall safety objective is to assess differences between groups in severity, incidence and 
frequency of AEs, Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs), AEs of Special Interest (AESIs), and 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), concomitant medication use, suicidal ideat ion and behavior, and 
vital signs to support the package insert for MDMA -assisted psychotherapy.  
The following safety objectives will evaluate the safety of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy 
compared to identical psychotherapy with inactive placebo:  
 
1. Compare re lative incidence of AEs during Experimental Sessions that may be indicative 
of a medical complication of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), such as 
clinical signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or neurological symptoms 
or any ot her signs or symptoms that prompt additional vital sign measurements.  
2. Compare relative incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_926].  
3. Compare relative incidence of TEAEs, to determine relationship to the IMP based on 
relative incidence in the MDMA group.  
4. Compare relative i ncidence of TEAEs by [CONTACT_120555], 1 day, and 2 days after IMP administration.  
5. Compare relative incidence of AESIs, defined as AEs specified in the protocol related to 
cardiac function and abuse liability.  
6. Compare relati ve incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_120556], resulting in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and continuing at Study Termination.  
7. Compare relative incidence of SAEs.  
8. Compare relative incidence of psychiatric concomitant medicati ons taken during an 
Experimental Session, 1 day, and 2 days after IMP administration.  
9. Compare relative incidence of any psychiatric concomitant medications taken during the 
Treatment Period.  
10. Compare relative incidence of positive or serious suicidal ideati on and positive suicidal 
behavior assessed with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) by 
[CONTACT_1570].  
11. Compare mean changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature from pre -IMP 
administration to end of each Experimental Session  by [CONTACT_1570].  
 
Recruitment and Participant Population  
 
Approximately N≈[ADDRESS_1062581] of mouth. The sponsor will monitor demographics on an 
ongoing basis and encourage diversity (representative of PTSD population) in enrollment of study 
participants by [CONTACT_120558]. Randomization will be strat ified by [CONTACT_68566].  
 
Participants will be persons aged [ADDRESS_1062582] severe PTSD 
per the PCL -5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM -5) at Screening with symptoms present for at least [ADDRESS_1062583] a 
Total Severity Score equal to or greater than 35 (severe). Participants would not be excluded for 
having more than one traumatic event or for having tried, not tolerated, or refused a selective 
serotonin  reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] (SNRI) 
prescribed for PTSD. Participants with confirmed diagnosis of specific psychological and 
personality disorders will be excluded. Participants must be in good physical health a nd without 
major medical disorders that could affect the safety or tolerability of MDMA.  
 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_1062584] Model Repeated Measure 
(MMRM) model to CAPS -4 (Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale for DSM -4) data from the 
Phase [ADDRESS_1062585] covariance parameters. With a sample size of 50 participants per 
treatment group in the modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population, this study has 90% power to 
detect a treatment effect, using a two -sided test with an alpha of 0.0499. Additional p articipants 
may be enrolled, depending on sample size re -estimation by [CONTACT_3153], with 
conditional power analysis conducted at a group -unblinded interim analysis for efficacy when 
[ADDRESS_1062586] 60% of the blinded parti cipants (N=60) have completed 
their final CAPS -5 assessment and terminated treatment. Under no circumstances will the number 
of participants enrolled (at V0) be reduced below the initial planned 100, in order to obtain 
additional safety data.  
 
Primary Effi cacy Analysis  
 
All efficacy analyses will be based on the mITT analysis set. The primary treatment comparison 
will be made at a 2 -sided, 0.0499 level of significance. The reduction from Visit 3 (Baseline) in 
CAPS -5 Total Severity Scores between groups will  be compared at Visit 19 (Primary Outcome) 
with least squares means from an MMRM model. The mITT analysis set will include all 
randomized participants who receive IMP in at least one blinded Experimental Session and have 
at least one follow -up CAPS -5 asses sment.

Page 21 of 104 2.0 Introduction  
The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a non -profit research and 
educational organization working as a clinical trial sponsor to obtain marketing approval for the 
prescription use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as an adjunct to 
psychotherapy in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Controlled Phase 1 studies, 
nonclinical studies, and investigator -initiated studies formed the basis for the Clinical 
Development  Program of MDMA under Investigational New Drug (IND) #063384. MAPS -
sponsored studies are implemented through MAPS’ wholly owned subsidiary and delegate, the 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation (MPBC).  
 
2.1 Rationale  
PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that ne gatively impacts a person’s daily life. MDMA has 
been shown to reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, enhance communication, and 
increase empathy. MDMA may enhance fear extinction learning in humans. These subjective 
effects of MDMA create a product ive psychological state that enhances the therapeutic process 
for the treatment of PTSD and other anxiety disorders. This is supported by [CONTACT_773752] [ADDRESS_1062600] 
severe PTSD, the sponsor is conducting this pi[INVESTIGATOR_773725] 3 randomized, placebo -controlled, 
two-arm, double -blind, multi -site study which will include an interim analysis of CAPS -5 data for 
sample size re -estimation. This novel treatment package consists of three once -monthly 
Experimental Sessions of psy chotherapy combined with either a flexible dose of MDMA or 
inactive placebo, along with non -drug preparatory and integrative psychotherapy. The Primary 
Outcome measure, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS -5), evaluates changes in 
PTSD symptom sever ity and is assessed by a blinded centralized Independent Rater (IR) pool.  
 
2.2 Background  
2.2.1 PTSD  
PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder associated with increased mortality and cardiometabolic 
morbidity. PTSD is a stress -related psychiatric condition that may oc cur following a traumatic 
event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. The four main 
symptom categories described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th 
edition (DSM -5), include arousal and react ivity, avoidance of triggers, negative thoughts and 
feelings, and intrusive thoughts and nightmares. PTSD negatively impacts a person’s daily life, 
resulting in fractured relationships, inability to maintain employment, diminished cognitive and 
psychosocia l functioning, substance abuse, high -cost healthcare utilization, and increased 
depression and suicide risk. People who suffer from PTSD often relive the experience through 
nightmares and flashbacks, have poor sleep quality, and feel detached or estranged.  Confronting 
overwhelming internal distress and frightening external environments can also lead to high levels 
of depersonalization and derealization, which led clinicians to identify a dissociative subtype of 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_1062601] been observed in imaging studies 
of patients with PTSD that underlie alterations in emotional processing and regulation, cognition, 
and many aspects of behavior, though clinical symptoms and changes in brain activity are not 
homogenous acros s patients [1]. The dissociative subtype occurs in 12 to 30% of people with 
PTSD and is characterized by [CONTACT_120561], while the 
non-dissociative subtype presents symptoms of hyperarousal and re -experiencing, an emotional 
undermodulation me diated by [CONTACT_773753] [2, 3] . 
Patients suffering from the dissociative subtype of PTSD typi[INVESTIGATOR_773726], wit h mixed response to existing evidence -based 
treatments.  
 
Approximately 7% of the population in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.) will have PTSD sometime in 
their life, but this figure jumps to 10.8% to 13% of veterans with combat experience [4]. For 
soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, the incidence of PTSD is 17.1% with 400,000 to 
500,000 U.S. Iraq/Afg hanistan veterans reportedly having PTSD. In 2004, the Defense 
Department and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) spent $4.3 billion on PTSD disability 
payments to approximately 215,000 veterans [5]. In 2012 alone the VA spent $294 million and $[ADDRESS_1062602] of about $17 billion 
per year [6]. There are an estimated 20 to 22 suicides a day by [CONTACT_23065] [7]. 
 
Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of 
people who try them for adequate dose and duration. This indicates a need to develop treat ments 
targeting durable remission of PTSD. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 
only two pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_57589], both of which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs). Paroxetine and sertraline (Paxil and Zoloft) both demonst rated statistically significant 
superiority over placebo on the CAPS in 12 -week confirmatory clinical trials with daily dosing, 
but some studies were less effective in treating combat -related PTSD and sertraline demonstrated 
gender differences with minimal  efficacy in men [8-10]. PTSD rarely remits after [ADDRESS_1062603] -line treatment by [CONTACT_41309]’s National Center for PTSD in 
the U.S., as well as by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO). An extensive list of medications, 
namely antipsychotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and sleep aids, are frequently prescribed off -
label but have only small effect sizes in reducing PTSD symptoms. PTSD brings a high public 
burden, both economically and socially, by [CONTACT_120564], lost 
wages, and disability payment s [11, 12] . Given the chronicity of PTSD, low compliance 
evidenced by [CONTACT_120565],  and limited recovery with current medications contributing to 
serious outcomes, PTSD patients suffer from unmet medical need.  
 
One treatment approach is to develop medications and/or psychotherapeutic treatments that may 
indirectly decrease or eliminate the neurochemical pathologies underlying the chronic 
hyperarousal and dysregulation of the hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal (HPA) axis associated with 
PTSD. Cognitive behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], particularly prolonged exposure and cognitive processing 
therapy, are  considered among the most effective psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Other methods such as 
psychodynamic therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) have also 
proven to be effective in treating some symptoms of PTSD [13, 14] , although some patients may 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 23 of 104 need more than one type of treatment to reduce or resolve those symptoms. A meta -analysis 
concluded that all “bona fide” psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including those liste d above, are similarly 
effective with PTSD [15]. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into 
medications and other methods that  may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD 
(see [16] for a review). Examples of this are virtual reality -assisted exposure therapy [17, 18]  and 
D-cycloserine -assisted psychotherapy [19]. MDMA -assisted psychotherapy is anoth er such 
approach.  
 
2.2.2 MDMA  
MDMA is a ring -substituted phenylisopropylamine derivative invented by [CONTACT_120566] 1912 [20, 21] . Similar to SSRIs, MDMA binds to the serotonin 
transporter, but has additional effects on carrier -mediated r elease and reuptake inhibition of 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] , and to a lesser extent in humans, dopamine [22-28]. MDMA also incre ases levels 
of affiliative neurohormones oxytocin and vasopressin, which increases trust and attenuates 
reactivity to threatening cues, and some researchers have suggested a role for oxytocin in treating 
PTSD. The indirect effects of MDMA on central and pe ripheral neurohormone release contribute 
to a novel mechanism that may help regulate the HPA axis, which would treat the core 
psychopathology of PTSD for a durable remission.  
 
Onset of MDMA effects occurs ~0.[ADDRESS_1062604] found a 
small percentage of people exhibit problematic use of Ecstasy (material represented a s containing 
MDMA) [29, 30] . Studies of regular or problematic Ecstasy users indicate that on average, 
regular use occurs no more often than once a week [31]. Hence, MDMA may have moderate 
abuse potential. See the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for a more detailed explanation.  
  
2.2.3 MDMA -Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD  
Many psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_773727] [14]. To be effective, exposure must be accompanied by a degree of 
emotional engagement or “fear activation” while avoiding dissociation or overwhelming emotion 
[32]. This has been referred to as working within the “optimal arousal zone” or “window of 
tolerance” [33-35]. 
 
The comb ined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear 
of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic 
and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. 
PTSD increases amygdala activity, causing heightened encoding of fearful memories and 
decreasing blood flow in the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, MDMA acutely decreases activity in 
the amygdala [36], and there is some indication that MDMA may increase activity in the 
prefrontal cortex [37]. Brain ima ging after MDMA indicates less reactivity to angry facial 
expressions and greater reward in happy faces [36]. This action is compatible with its reported 
reduction in fear or defensiveness, and is in contrast to the stimulation of the amygdala observed 
in animal models of conditioned fear, a state similar to PTSD [38-40]. The reduction in stress -
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_1062605], acceptance of self and others, and ability to address 
these issues without extreme disorientation or ego loss due to alert state of consciousness.  These 
factors taken together can provide the opportunity for a corrective emotional experience.  
 
A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD 
because MDMA can attenuate the fear response of a perceived threat t o one’s emotional integrity 
and decrease defensiveness without blocking access to memories or preventing a deep and 
genuine experience of emotion [41-44]. Elimination of these conditioned fear responses can lead 
to more open and comfortable communication about past traumatic events and greater access to 
information about them [45]. Participants are able to experience and express fear, anger, and grief 
with less likelihood of feeling overwhelmed by [CONTACT_120568]. MDMA seems to engender 
internal awareness that even painful feelings that arise are an important  part of the therapeutic 
process. In addition, feelings of empathy, love, and deep appreciation often emerge, along with a 
clearer perspective of the trauma as a past event, a more accurate perspective about its 
significance, and a heightened awareness of the support and safety that exists in the present. As a 
result, MDMA -assisted psychotherapy may enable the participants to restructure their intra -
psychic realities and develop a wider behavioral and emotional repertoire with which to respond 
to anxiogenic  stimuli.  
 
The therapeutic method is described in further detail in the Treatment Manual of MDMA -
Assisted Psychotherapy, which the sites and therapy teams will be trained on prior to the study.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_1062606] to report on the 
effects of MDMA in humans [46], with 80 to 160 milligrams  (mg) MDMA required to produce 
desired subjective effects in humans [46, 47] . MDMA was found to robus tly influence human 
emotional status in a unique way [46] without adversely a ffecting physiological functions or 
perception, such as visual perception or cognition [48-51]. In the 1970s, psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_590376] -assisted psychotherapy to treat psychological disorders, including anxiety [52]. Legal 
therapeutic use continued until its placement on the U.S. list of Schedule 1 substances in 1985 
[42, 45, 53] . An estimated 500,000 doses of MDMA were administered during psychotherapy and 
personal growth  sessions in North America prior to its scheduling [42, 54] . A few uncontrolled 
human studies of MDMA assessing safety in a thera peutic setting occurred in the 1980s [55, 56] . 
 
Controlled human studies for clinical development of MDMA commenced in the mid -1990s with 
a MAPS -funded investigator -initiated Phase 1  dose-response safety study [57, 58] . Starting in 
[ADDRESS_1062607] and safety pi[INVESTIGATOR_590377]. This study 
enrolled six participants, with four receiving a single session of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy 
without a ny safety concerns and with some PTSD symptom reduction [44]. These studies formed 
the basis of clinical experience with MDMA prior to studies subsequently conducted under a 
MAPS IND.  
 
Under  IND #063384, MAPS initiated an international series of Phase [ADDRESS_1062608] moderate 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 25 of 104 PTSD (CAPS -4 score: 50+), with at least 6 months of symptoms. Participant s were not excluded 
for having more than one traumatic event, or for having tried, not tolerated, or refused an SSRI or 
serotonin -norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] (SNRI) prescribed for PTSD. Outcomes from six 
Phase [ADDRESS_1062609] been published: one study in the U.S. with a long -term 
follow -up (LTFU) conducted an average of 3.8 years after the  final MDMA -assisted 
psychotherapy session (MP1) [43, 59]  and one in Switzerland (MP2) [60, 61] . MP1 was followed 
by a small open -label extension study examining the treatment of relap se in three participants 
with a single MDMA -assisted psychotherapy treatment and a 12 -month follow -up (MP1E2). 
Three additional studies have completed treatments (MP8, MP9, MP12) and two international 
studies were terminated early for logistical reasons wi th partial datasets (MP3, MP4). These 
studies tested a range of designs, such as a placebo control (MP1, MP4), low dose MDMA 
comparator control (MP2, MP9), and three -arm dose response studies (MP8, MP12). MP4 was 
terminated early due to delays in regulator y approval and enrollment timelines, with available 
efficacy data presented without a formal analysis. MP3 was terminated early by [CONTACT_773754]; efficacy 
data ar e not available for these reasons (MP3 is excluded from Phase 2 data).  
 
Intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis of primary efficacy and safety data from six MAPS -sponsored 
MDMA PTSD Phase 2 clinical trials worldwide (MP1, MP2, MP4, MP8, MP9, MP12) consisting 
of 107  blinded participants with chronic PTSD was completed in 2016. In these studies, PTSD, 
independent of cause, appears treatable with a two to three -session treatment package of MDMA -
assisted psychotherapy. As of October 1, 2018, with 248 individuals exposed  to MDMA in the 
sponsor’s development program across various indications and at least 1,[ADDRESS_1062610] of 
difference in CAPS -4 severity scores from Baseline, 2 months after two blinded Experimental 
Sessions (p<0.001). The dropout rate across studi es was 7.5% (8 of 107). Large between -groups 
effect size estimates (0.9), initial indications of efficacy, and favorable safety outcomes support 
expanding the research initiative to encompass a larger sample of participants with PTSD in a 
Phase [ADDRESS_1062611] clinical measures to con firm the efficacy and 
safety of manualized MDMA -assisted psychotherapy with a flexible dose MDMA in reducing 
PTSD and associated symptoms in comparison to the same psychotherapy combined with an 
inactive placebo control.  
 
3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary obje ctive of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy 
for PTSD compared to identical psychotherapy with inactive placebo, as measured by [CONTACT_120570] -5 Total Severity Score from Visit 3 (Baseline) to Visit 19 (18 weeks pos t 
Baseline).

IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 26 of 104 3.2 Key Secondary Objective  
The key secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of MDMA -assisted 
psychotherapy for PTSD compared to identical psychotherapy with inactive placebo in clinician -
rated functional impairment, as measu red by [CONTACT_120571] (SDS) 
item scores from Visit 3 (Baseline) to Visit 19 ([ADDRESS_1062612] Baseline).  
 
3.3 Safety Objectives  
The overall safety objective is to assess differences between groups in severity, incidence and 
frequency  of Adverse Events (AEs), Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs), AEs of Special Interest 
(AESIs), and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), concomitant medication use, suicidal ideation and 
behavior, and vital signs to support the package insert for MDMA -assisted psycho therapy. The 
following safety objectives will evaluate the safety of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy compared 
to identical psychotherapy with inactive placebo:  
 
1. Compare relative incidence of AEs during Experimental Sessions that may be 
indicative of a medical complication of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) 
such as clinical signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or 
neurological symptoms or any other signs or symptoms that prompt additional vital 
sign measurements.  
2. Compare rela tive incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_926].  
3. Compare relative incidence of TEAEs, to determine relationship to the IMP based on 
relative incidence in the MDMA group.  
4. Compare relative incidence of TEAEs by [CONTACT_120555], 1 day, and 2 days after IMP administration.  
5. Compare relative incidence of AESIs, defined as AEs specified in the protocol 
related to cardiac function and abuse liability.  
6. Compare relative incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_773755], resulting in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and continuing at Study 
Termination.  
7. Compare relative incidence of SAEs.  
8. Compare relative incidence of concomitant medications taken during an 
Experimental Session, 1 day, and 2 days after IMP administration.  
9. Compare relative incidence of psychiatric concomitant medications taken during the 
Treatment Period.  
10. Compare relative incidence of positive or serious suicidal ideation and positive 
suicidal behavior assessed with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -
SSRS ) by [CONTACT_1570].  
11. Compare mean changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature from pre -
IMP administration to end of each Experimental Session by [CONTACT_1570].  
 
3.4 Exploratory Objectives  
These objectives may be explored to characterize part icipants receiving MDMA -assisted 
psychotherapy in comparison to those receiving psychotherapy with inactive placebo to support 
the primary objective:  
 
1. Explore the effect of presence of secondary traumatic stressors (LEC -5) on the CAPS -5 
Total Severity anal yses.  
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 27 of 104 2. Explore changes in PTSD symptom clusters of re -experiencing, avoidance, negative 
alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal, as measured by [CONTACT_120572] -5 
subscale scores from Visit 3 (Baseline) to Visit 19 ([ADDRESS_1062613] Baseline).  
3. Chara cterization of CAPS -[ADDRESS_1062614] of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) on the CAPS -5 Total Severity 
analyses.  
5. Explore differen ces between treatment groups in:

an overnight stay. The Primary Outcome measure, the change in CAPS -5 from Baseline (Visit 3), 
is assessed by a centralized IR pool at [ADDRESS_1062635] Baseline (Visit 19). The CAPS -5 is also 
administered as  an exploratory measure after Treatments 1 and 2 (Visits 8 and 13). The IR pool 
will be blinded to treatment assignment, visit number, and number of treatments received, and 
will not have access to data collected by [CONTACT_773758]. 
 
Upon unblinding after database lock, all participants who were assigned to placebo (regardless of 
CAPS -5 scores), completed the study , meet criteria, and are in good standing with the clinical site 
will be offered the opportunity to enroll in an open -label safety extension study of manualized

5.2.1 Interruptions and Accommodations Due to COVID -19 Pandemic or Any 
Other Unforeseen Emergency at Clin ic Locations  
This clinical trial has been interrupted by [CONTACT_120587] 2019 (COVID -19) global 
pandemic. Accommodations may be required for study continuation and participant and study site 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 39 of 104 staff safety due to this emergency or any other unforesee n emergency in the future. The following 
accommodations in the protocol will be allowed, captured and noted  in the Clinical Study Report 
as COVID -19 deviations:  
 
• Integrative Sessions may be conducted by [CONTACT_144891]  
• Delaying the start of medication tapering after enrollment and the subsequent Treatment 
Period per Section 1 2.1 Tapering Instructions  
• Delaying Experimental Sessions and associated Integrative Sessions  
• Delaying Ind ependent Rater assessments for participants who cannot complete them 
remotely off -site 
• Use of prohibited medications and/or cannabis or initiation of new psychotherapy for 
participants with significant study delays, which will be reviewed by [CONTACT_773759] -tapered prior to resuming treatment per Section 
12.0 Concomitant Medications . 
 
For any participant with COVID -19 related illness, continued trial participation after full recovery 
of the disease may be appropriate after discussion between the site physicians and Medical 
Monitors on a case -by-case basis.  
 
5.3 Discontinuation and Completion Criteria  
5.3.1 Complete or Evaluable Participants  
Participants who are considered complete or ev aluable will be defined as follows:  
 
• A participant is considered ‘Evaluable’ and eligible for the mITT analysis if they have 
completed at least one Experimental Session and one CAPS -5 assessment beyond 
Baseline.  
• A participant is considered ‘Evaluable and  Completed Per Protocol’ if they have 
completed all Experimental Sessions and CAPS -5 assessments as planned. These 
participants will be included in the mITT analysis set and the Per Protocol analysis set.  
• A participant is considered ‘Evaluable and Early Te rmination’ if they have completed at 
least one Experimental Session and one CAPS -5 assessment beyond Baseline but 
terminated early. These participants will be included in the mITT analysis.  
• A participant is considered to be in good standing with the clini cal site if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_120484]/or therapy team, the participant was compliant with protocol 
requirements, even if they were unable to complete all study visits.  
 
5.3.2 Screen Failures  
‘Screen Failures’ are defined as participants who pass ph one screening but are deemed ineligible 
before successfully enrolling in the study at Visit 0. Screen failures may fail to meet all Inclusion 
Criteria and may meet one or more Exclusion Criteria or withdraw consent prior to Enrollment. 
All potential partic ipants who begin Screening will be tracked on a Screening Log, and reasons 
for Screen Failure will be recorded. Screen Failures are not considered evaluable.  
 
Screen Failures may be identified through review of medical history, assessments, measures, 
laboratory results, or conversations with the participant. Medical assessments may be repeated for 
confirmation. At any time during Screening, if a potential participant is deemed to be ineligible, 
classify as a Screen Failure, notify the potential participant  that they are unfortunately not eligible 
for the study, and do not schedule additional Screening assessments. Participants who fail 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 40 of 104 Screening may be rescreened at a later date if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_773760] a new copy of the Inf ormed Consent Form (ICF). Screen Failures may request a referral to 
an outside therapi[INVESTIGATOR_292416]. Screen Failures that were scheduled for an IR assessment will be 
entered into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  
 
5.3.3 Pre-Randomization Early Termination s 
‘Pre-randomization Early Terminations’ are defined as participants who were deemed eligible 
and enrolled in the study at Visit 0, but are deemed ineligible prior to the first Experimental 
Session and do not have enrollment confirmed at Visit 4. These par ticipants may fail to meet all 
Inclusion Criteria and may meet one or more Exclusion Criteria or withdraw consent prior to 
Enrollment Confirmation or the site may withdraw the participant for reasons described in 
Section 5.3.4 Early Termination from the Study ). Participants who fail Enrollment Confirmation 
may not be re -enrolled into this study at a later date. All enrolled participants, even those failing 
Enrollment Confirmation, will be maintained in the EDC syst em. Pre -randomization Early 
Terminations are not considered evaluable.  
 
Pre-randomization Early Terminations may be identified through review of medical history, 
assessments, measures, laboratory results, or conversations with the participant. At any time 
during the Preparatory Period, if a potential participant is deemed to be ineligible, classify as a 
Pre-randomization Early Termination, notify the potential participant that they are unfortunately 
not eligible for the study, and do not schedule additional  assessments. Do not randomize the 
participant. Pre -randomization Early Terminations will be provided an Exit Plan as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Exit Plan .  
 
5.3.4 Early Termination from the Study  
Participants who are removed from the study after they are randomized and receive IMP but do 
not complete the study may fall into one of these categories: Post -randomization Early 
Termination or Dropout. If the participant has received IMP in at least one Experimental Session 
and completed one CAPS -[ADDRESS_1062657] of the participant or if the participant cannot comply with elements of the protocol  that 
are critical for safety or for the scientific integrity of the study. If the site team makes the decision 
to terminate the participant from treatment or the study, they will explain the reason for 
withdrawal and document in the participant’s source r ecords and Electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF ). If a participant develops any Exclusion Criteria that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_773728], affects the safety of the participant, including psychiatric diagnosis, medical 
diagnosis, pregnancy, or re quiring use of prohibited medications, the participant will discontinue 
treatment in Experimental Sessions but remain in the study for the associated Integrative 
Sessions. Participants whose Experimental Sessions are delayed by [CONTACT_25963] -19 pandemic may 
start any of these medications during the delay, as clinically indicated. When study visits resume, 
they will be given the option to resume Experimental Sessions after tapering off of these 
medications per Section 1 2.1 Tapering Instructions . Any time a participant terminates from the 
study early, the site team will attempt to obtain information about AE outcomes if appropriate, as 
determined by [CONTACT_120591]. The site team will provide the par ticipant 
with an Exit Plan as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] Exit Plan .

Page 41 of 104 Data will be collected from participants who terminate early as follows:   
 
• Post-randomization Early Termination : Participants who discontinue study treatme nt 
but continue to participate in Independent Rater primary and secondary outcome 
assessments. Data collection by [CONTACT_120592].  
• Dropout : If a participant decides to withdraw co nsent completely, they will terminate 
without further follow -up. If the participant agrees, they will complete a final CAPS -[ADDRESS_1062658] one dose of  IMP and no longer participate in the study (i.e., 
no further contact [CONTACT_120593]). Data collected on study participants up 
to the time of withdrawal of consent will remain in the trial database in order to maintain 
scientific validity . Removal of data from the database would undermine the scientific and 
ethical integrity of the research.

The sponsor has the right to discontinue this study at any time. If the trial is prematurely 
terminated, the investigator is to promptly inform participants and wil l ensure they receive 
appropriate therapy, follow -up, and Exit Plan. If the study is prematurely discontinued, all 
procedures and requirements pertaining to retention and storage of documents will be observed. 
All other study materials will be returned to the sponsor and will be treated in accordance with 
federal and state regulations.

IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_1062661] been safely used in previous Phase 2 
studies sponsored by [CONTACT_120553]. Phase 2 studies indicate that 75, 100 and 125 mg MDMA initial 
doses with the supplemental dose are active and effective in two to three Experimental Sessions. 
MDMA doses with an optimal risk -benefit ratio range from 75 mg (Cohen’s d Independent 
Groups Pre -test Post -test [dIGPP]=2. 73, N=7) to 125 mg (Cohen’s dIGPP=0.77, N=58) initial 
dose of MDMA with a 2 -session treatment package. In Phase 2 studies, the sponsor observed a    
-36.4 point mean change in CAPS -4 scores among active dose participants receiving two 
Experimental Sessions  (N=72) compared to a -44.2 point mean change after three Experimental 
Sessions (N=51). Although uncontrolled, the additional 7.[ADDRESS_1062662] been administered safely in MP2 (150 
mg and 75 mg supplemental) and in Phase 1 studies (150 mg and 160 mg). The results of these 
Phase 2 studies led to the selection of 80 mg and 120 mg MDMA as the initial active doses to be 
compared to inactive placebo in Phase 3 trials.  
 
This blinded study will compare the effects of a flexible dose of MDMA or placebo administered 
in three Experimental Sessions. Initial doses per Experimental Session range from 80 mg to 120 
mg of MDMA compounded with inactive excipi[INVESTIGATOR_773729] e weight placebos 
comprised entirely of inactive excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half -
dose (40 mg or 60 mg, or placebo). A flexible dosing regimen was chosen to mimic proposed 
clinical practice and better adapt to risk -benefit c onsiderations. The initial active doses of [ADDRESS_1062663] from psychotherapy alone. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_773730] -assisted psychotherapy

6.0 Psychotherapy  
6.1 Description of Therapeutic Method  
The largely non -directive therapeutic method of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy is described in 
detail in the Treatment Manual. All therapy teams will be extensivel y trained in a multi -week 
training program prior to the study to ensure all participants are treated in a similar manner. The 
non-directive approach pertains to inviting inquiry and providing suggestion rather than directing 
the participant in the therapeu tic approach. This requires active or engaged listening and 
responding, as well as facilitation of therapeutic action by [CONTACT_590433] a manner that does not interfere with the participant’s spontaneous 
experience.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1062666] ensure that the minimum requirements 
below are met:  
 
• One person licensed to manage and administer controlled substances for each site  
• A physician to assess participant safety at Screening  
• One or more two -person therapy teams, male/female preferred  
• One person per therapy team is required to be licensed to provide psychotherapy 
according to state and local requirements  
• If one person on the therapy team is unlicensed, they will work under the direct 
supervision of the licensed team member  
 
6.3 Training  
The sponsor’s Therapy Training Program is designed to teach competency in applying the 
essential elements of this method of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy. Therapy t eam members will 
receive specific training in the MDMA -assisted psychotherapy method, protocol, and latest 
version of the IB. Training in the psychotherapy method consists of reading the Treatment 
Manual, completing an online training module, and participa ting in an in -person training program 
that includes watching and discussing videos of Experimental Sessions. The final part of training 
includes supervision from the training team during a Phase [ADDRESS_1062667] the proper background, education, and exp erience.  
 
6.4 Adherence to Therapeutic Method  
Psychotherapy sessions, including Experimental Sessions, may be recorded, with recordings 
preserved for research and training purposes. Adherence criteria and competence ratings will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_3784], tra ined, and blinded Adherence Raters who will analyze video data from 
specific and randomly selected Preparatory Sessions, Experimental Sessions, and Integrative 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 44 of 104 Sessions. The elements included in adherence criteria are specific to each type of session and a re 
defined in the Treatment Manual. These ratings will be collected, at minimum, for each therapy 
team in the study. Ratings will be used to provide feedback to new therapy teams, to further 
characterize the manualized therapy, and for future exploratory r esearch.

7.1 Primary Outcome Measure and Reliability  
7.1.1 CAPS -5 (Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale for DSM -5) 
The last month CAPS -5 is a semi -structured interview that assesses index history of DSM -5-
defined traumatic event exposure [62], including the most distressing event, time since exp osure, 
to produce a diagnostic score (presence vs. absence) and a PTSD Total Severity score [62]. The 
CAPS -5 rates intrusion symptoms (intrusive thoughts or memories), avoidance, co gnitive and 
mood symptoms, arousal and reactivity symptoms, duration and degree of distress and 
dissociation. The CAPS -5 will be administered by a blinded IR via telemedicine. Interviews will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_773761] y control by [CONTACT_284193] -level 
variation in interview fidelity and quality. The IRs will be trained and supervised by a research 
reliable trainer and will be supervised by [CONTACT_5944]. Per the CAPS -5 Training Manual 
for the IR Pool, IRs will ensu re that every single item -level score is collected in every CAPS -5 
interview. The CAPS -5 is administered by [CONTACT_773762] a neutral, non -leading manner to minimize 
the chance for bias. Additionally, the IRs are trained to carefully assess trauma -relatedness of  
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_1062669], or quer y further if behavioral examples are needed 
to determine the appropriate symptom intensity rating. Avoiding building therapeutic/clinical 
rapport beyond the basic level of rapport needed to conduct the interview in the research setting 
also minimizes the c hance for bias. Remote assessment assures that the rater who is collecting the 
Primary Outcome will not witness Experimental Sessions and the acute effects of IMP, which 
strengthens the study blind. Interviews may be recorded in as many instances as necess ary to 
establish reliability of a random selection of interviews for accuracy. After the initial screening 
visit, the IRs will be blinded to visit number, number of treatments received, treatment 
assignment, and any study data for the participant. IR visit s will be assigned based on availability.  
 
7.2 Secondary Measure  
7.2.1 SDS (Sheehan Disability Scale)  
The SDS is a clinician -rated assessment of functional impairment [63]. The items indicate degree 
of impairment in the domains of work/school, social life, and home life, with response options 
based on an eleven -point scale (0=not at all to 10=extremely), and f ive verbal tags (not at all, 
mildly, moderately, markedly, extremely). The SDS takes 1 to 2 minutes to complete. The 
measure can be scored for each of the three domains. The SDS has high internal consistency and 
accurately identified 80% of a sample of pri mary care patients with mental disorders [64].  
 
7.3 Safety Measures  
7.3.1 C-SSRS (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale)  
The C -SSRS is a clinician -administere d measure of suicidal behavior devised to detect potential 
suicidal thoughts or behaviors during a clinical trial [65]. It consists of a Lifetime version  and a 
Since Last Visit version that assess suicidal ideation, ideation intensity, and behavior. The C -
SSRS consists of a series of questions and can be administered during a face -to-face interview or 
over the telephone. The Lifetime version will only be a dministered at the initial Screening visit. 
All subsequent administrations will utilize the Since Last Visit version. Participants who are 
discontinuing medications to participate in the study will complete the C -SSRS before and after 
medication washout. T he C-SSRS Intensity scale for Lifetime obtained a Cronbach’s alpha of 
0.[ADDRESS_1062670] Visit C -SSRS severity scores were 
positively correlated with the BDI “suicide thoughts” item [66]. 
 
7.4  Screening Measures and Reliability  
7.4.1 MINI (Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview)  
This version of the MINI (7.0.2), a structured interview that was first developed in 1998 to be 
compatible with DSM and International Classification of Disease (ICD) criteria for psychiatric 
illnesses [67], is now compatible with DSM -5 and will be administered by a member of the 
Independent Rater Pool to screen for psychiatric conditions per DSM -5. Each module of the 
MINI consists of two or three questions where the answer is either “Yes” or “No,” and decision -
tree logic is used to determine whether to ask additional questions [68]. The MINI takes between 
15 and 20 minutes to perform and addresses major psychiatric disorders. MINI items were highly

the Composite Diagnostic Interview and the SCID [68, 69]  Testing on nonpsychiatric samples did 
not create false positives [67]. 
 
7.4.2 SCID -5-PD (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 for Personality 
Disorders)  
The SCID -5-PD will be administered by a blinded IR via telemedicine [70]. Prior to the SCID -5-
PD clinical interview, participants will complete a brief self -report questionnaire called the SCID -
5 Self-report Personality Questionnaire (SCID -5-SPQ) as a self -report screening tool used to 
assess for personality disorders. Potential personality disorders that satisfy diagnostic thresholds 
will be further assessed via clinical interview during the SCID -5-PD. IRs will receive training on 
administering these measures from a research reliable trainer. Interviews may be recorded in as 
many instances as necessary to establish reliability of a random selection of interviews for 
accuracy.  
 
7.4.3 LEC -5 (Life Events Ch ecklist for DSM -5) 
The LEC -5 is a 17 -item self -report instrument designed to determine the presence of traumatic 
life events in the assessment and diagnosis of PTSD. It is a companion measure to the PCL -5 and 
will be used to assess PTSD. The participant in dicates whether each event listed has occurred 
during their lifetime, permitting the possibility of marking multiple events [71]. 
 
7.4.4 PCL -5 (PTSD Checklist)  
The PCL -5 is a 20 -item self -report questionnaire in which respondents indicate the presence and 
severity of PTSD symptoms, derived from the symptoms of PTSD per DSM -5 [72]. Participants 
indicate how much distress they have experienced due to symptoms such as "Repeated, disturbing 
memories, thoughts, or images of a stressful experience from the past," "Trouble remembering 
important parts of a stressful experience from the past," and "Feeling irritable or having angry 
outbursts" on a five -point Likert -type scale (1=Not at all to 5=Extremely). A total PCL -5 score of 
46 at Screening will be required for in itial enrollment.  
 
7.4.5 DDIS (Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM -5) 
Questions on the DDIS specifically addressing dissociative disorder symptoms (items 117  to 130) 
will be asked by [CONTACT_773763]. These questions are part of an intensive interview that 
includes questions concerning somatic and psychiatric symptoms. The interview is intended to 
assess and potentially distinguish between dissociative disorders and other disorders and between 
Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and a dissoci ative disorder not otherwise specified [73]. 
Owing to overlap with items found between the DDIS and other screening measures, only 
questions specifically addressing DID will be assessed.  
 
7.5 Exploratory Measures  
7.5.1 DSP -I (The Dissociative Subtype of PTSD Interview)  
The DSP -I is a  clinician -administered interview designed by [CONTACT_590435] (“add -on”) to the CAPS -5 [74]. Assessments of 
military veterans and civilians support the existence of a dissociative subtype of PTSD that is 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 48 of 104 associated with PTSD severity and derealization and depersonalization [75-77]. The DSP -I takes 
approximately 5 to 15 minutes to complete. It consists of two parts, only Part 1 will be 
administered. Part 1 contains five items addressing depersonalization, four items addres sing 
derealization, and a section that is administered if dissociative epi[INVESTIGATOR_590378] (seven items) and observer items (three items) 
addressing interviewee demeanor, including evidence of dissoc iation, such as forgetfulness or 
giving a statement that is bizarre within the context of the interview. If two or more items within 
this section are endorsed, this indicates the presence of other dissociative symptoms beyond 
depersonalization and derealiz ation. The DSP -I was first developed in 2016 and revised in 2017.  
 
7.5.2 ACE (Adverse Childhood Experience Questionnaire)  
The ACE is a [ADDRESS_1062672] and emotional, physic al, and sexual abuse. Respondents are asked 
if an experience happened “often” and if so, to write “1”. The total score reflects the number of 
adverse childhood experiences. The measure was first used in the context of a study investigating 
the relationship  between childhood adverse experiences and health outcomes in adulthood [78]. 
Number of frequent adverse childhood experiences is associated with adverse health outcomes in 
adulthood, including greater likelihood of heart disease, chronic pain, and poor work performance  
[79-82]. The scoring method has been used in archival research, finding an association between 
increased scores and health problems in several generations [81].  
 
7.5.3 BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory II)  
The BDI -II is a revision of the BDI, a 21 -item self -report measure [83, 84]  that will serve as a 
measure of depr ession symptom severity [85]. The BDI -II has been validated, has high internal 
consistency and good test/re -test reli ability, and is not overly sensitive to daily variations in 
mood. It takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete [85]. Score cutoffs indicate: 0 to 13 minimal 
depression, 14 to 19 mild depression,  20 to 28 moderate depression, and 29 to 63 severe 
depression. Initial and subsequent studies report that the BDI -II total score has a reliability 
coefficient of 0.90 to 0.91 which is related to other measures of depression symptoms [85, 86] . 
Higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.  
 
7.5.4 CPGS (Chronic Pain Grade Scale)  
The CPGS is a seven -item measure of pain. Responses to six of the seven items are made on a [ADDRESS_1062673] 3 to 6 
months when pain prevented the respondent from carrying out everyda y activities [87]. 
Responses to questions are used to attain a rating (grade) for pain from zero (no pain) to five 
(high di sability, severely limiting). The instrument has three scale scores: pain severity, pain 
intensity, and pain -related disability. Estimated time to complete is 3 to 5 minutes. The CPGS is a 
validated scale with high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha=0. 90) and correlated with other 
instruments assessing pain [88]. 
 
7.5.5 EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol Five Dimensions -Five Levels Questionnaire)  
The EQ -5D-5L is a two -part self -report questionnaire assessing health status. It consists of five 
dimensions; mobility, self -care, usual activ ities, pain -discomfort and anxiety -depression, and one 
visual analog scale (VAS). Responses are made on each dimension by [CONTACT_773764] s that best reflects their health on the day of measure completion, from the healthiest or 
fewest proble ms (e.g., “I have no trouble walking about”) to the most trouble (e.g., “I am unable 
to walk about”) [89, 90] . In the second part of the EQ -5D-5L, current degree of health (“your 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 49 of 104 health today”) is indicated by [CONTACT_112536] a 20 cm line marked form one to 100, with 100 considered 
“the best health you can imagine” and one “the worst he alth you can imagine.” The EQ -5D-5L 
does not sum responses, but treats each response on a dimension as a scale score, and the VAS is 
the location of the mark in centimeters. The scale can permit comparison across groups on health 
profiles, and an index can  be derived from matching the five dimension scores and the VAS 
response with nation -specific datasets and calculator software or statistical software syntax 
designed for the measure. The EQ -5D-5L began as part of the EuroQoL measure, published in 
1990 [91]. The instrument has been validated in populations from eight countries. EQ -5D-5L 
index scores and VAS scores assessed in people with stroke varied with degree of recovery 
assessed via long -term observation. EQ -5D-5L index scores and VAS scor es assessed in people 
with stroke varied with degree of recovery assessed via long -term observation [92]. The EQ -5D-
5L takes about 3 minutes to complete.  
 
7.5.6 IASC (Inventory of Altered Self Capacities)  
The IASC is a [ADDRESS_1062674] 
regulation [93]. The measure is completed by [CONTACT_590437] [ADDRESS_1062675] month (1=Never to 5=Very often) on a 5-point Likert scale. 
The IASC consists of seven 9 -item scales: interpersonal conflicts, idealizat ion-disillusionment, 
abandonment concerns, identity impairment, susceptibility to influence, affect dysregulation, and 
tension reduction activities. Subscale scores are summed into raw scale scores. Level of 
symptomatology is assessed through use of t -scores based upon scale norms. IASC subscales 
range in reliability from Cronbach’s alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_1062676] dysregulation scale 
scores were associated with a measure of depression [93]. 
 
7.5.7 IPF (Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning)  
The IPF will be administered as an exploratory measure at Baseline a nd 2-Month Follow -up. The 
IPF is a self -report instrument designed to assess functional impairment across a spectrum of 
domains [94]. The IPF is an 80 -item measure that was developed for use among individuals with 
PTSD. It assesses cu rrent psychosocial functioning across seven domains: romantic relationships, 
family, work, friendships, parenting, education, and self -care. Responses are made on a six point 
Likert scale, (1=Never to 6=Always). Domain scores can be computed for each subsc ale, which 
possess positive correlations with similar scales or subscales on other measures. The IPF has 
excellent psychometric properties, with Cronbach’s alpha for the total scale computed at 0.93 and 
good internal consistency for subscales (ranging from  0.80 to 0.90) [95].  
 
7.5.8 SCS (Self -Compassion Scale)  
The SCS is a 26 -item self -report measure of self -compassion, or responding to one's own failure, 
suffering or inadequacies with kindness and compassion and recognizing one's own flaws and 
suffering as part of common human experience [96]. Respondents complete the SCS by 
[CONTACT_773765][INVESTIGATOR_120490] a 5 -point Likert scale (1=Almost never and 
5=Almost always). It is estimated to take between 4 to 8 minutes to complete. The scale has six 
sub-scales: Self -Kindness, Self -Judgment, Common Humanity, Isolation, Min dfulness, and Over -
Identified. The mean of subscale scores serves as a total score. Analysis of SCS response 
indicated that subscales are all related to a higher order factor of self -compassion, and the 
measure has high test -test reliability at a level of 0.93. Neff et al. reported an inverse relationship 
between SCS total scores and scores on measures of depression and anxiety. Self -compassion and 
global self -esteem are both related to positive mood and optimism, but self -compassion may be

Page 50 of 104 more strongly as sociated with stable mood and less associated with self -rumination and anger 
[97]. 
 
7.5.9 TAS -20 (Toronto Alexithymia Scale)  
The TAS -20 is a 20 -item measure of self -reported difficulties with recognizing and verbalizing 
emotions [98, 99] . Responses are made on a 5 -point Likert scale (1=Strongly disagree to 
5=Strongly agree). Estimated time of measurement is 5 to 8 minutes. The scale is comprised of 
three subscales: Difficulty Describing Feelings, Difficulty Identifying Feelings , and Externally -
Oriented Thinking, with all scales summed to create a total score reflecting presence and degree 
of alexithymia. The TAS -[ADDRESS_1062677] 
reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.81, test -retest of 0.77).  
 
7.5.10  AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test)  
The AUDIT is a ten -item self -report test. Respondents answer on a 5 -point scale (0=Never or 
none, 4=Daily or greatest number) [100] . The ninth item addresses occurrence of injury of self or 
other as a result of drinking and the tenth addresses others’ concerns about the respondent’s 
drinking, with only three res ponses provided (0=No, 2=Yes, but not during the last year, 3=Yes, 
during the last year). The measure can readily detect alcohol abuse disorders in a wide array of 
individuals [101] . 
 
7.5.11  DUDIT (Drug Use Disorders Identification Test)  
The DUDIT is an 11 -item measure designed to assess presence of substance use disorders [102] . 
Responses to items are made on a [ADDRESS_1062678] of substances is provided at the end of the measure. The DUDIT is reliable, with a 
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.80. When compared with an interview based on ICD 10, the DUDIT had a 
sensitivity to detecting substance use disorders of 90% and a specificity of 80% [102] . The 
English translation was developed from a Swedish -language original . Estimated time to complete 
is 2 to 4 minutes.  
 
7.5.12  SRNU (Self -reported Nicotine Use)  
The SRNU is a sponsor -developed measure that will assess participant’s use of nicotine, 
including approximate frequency of use in the last month and attitudes towards quitti ng. The 
measure will take less than 3 minutes to complete.  
 
7.5.13  EAT -26 (Eating Attitudes Test)  
The EAT -26 is a 26 -item self -report measure that assesses attitudes about eating and food and is 
used to assess presence of eating disorders. Responses are made on a  six-point scale (1=Always 
to 6=Never), and gathers information on gender, age, height, and weight. The EAT -26 produces a 
total score and can be used to generate a “referral score.” The 27th item addresses the occurrence 
and frequency of specific eating be haviors, such as binge eating. Estimated time to complete is [ADDRESS_1062679] high reliability coefficients (Cronbach alpha of 0.83 to 
0.90) and has concurrent validity [103] .

Page 51 of 104 7.5.14  HPQSF (Health and Work Performance Absenteeism and Presenteeism Short 
Form)  
The HPQSF is a short form of a larger measure of health and work performance that has selected 
items referring to absenteeism and work performance [104] . The larger measure was created by 
[CONTACT_120599]. It consists of eight questions selected 
from the larger Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, with one question containing five 
additional items. Items include questions concerning hours worked during an average week, 
number of whole and partial days missed during a 4 -week period, and items that rate average 
coworker and self -work pe rformance on a ten -point Likert scale (1=Worst performance to 
10=Top performance). Hours spent in work over a [ADDRESS_1062680] 7 days can be 
used to estimate absenteeism, and the HPQSF can also score presenteeism, a measure of actual 
perform ance in relation to possible performance. Self -reports on measure appear to match 
employer records of presence or absence [105] , and the HPQSF appears to be reliable between 
one time point and another (reliability of 0.52) and is sensitive to change [104] . 
 
7.5.15  UFEC (Utilization of Facility -based and Emergent Care)  
The UFEC is a sponsor -developed measure assessing participant health events, including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_773731], including in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], rehabilitation 
facilities and other health care facilities for a set period prior to study entry.

IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_1062690] ( IRB)-approved script to ascertain if they meet basic eligibility criteria. All individuals 
who are pre -screened should be assigned a Screening Number and recorded on the Screening 
Log. Data from potential participant s who do not pass telephone screening will not be entered in 
the eCRF but reason of ineligibility will be documented on the Screening Log. At any time during 
Screening, if a potential participant is deemed ineligible, they will be classified as a Screen 
Failure, notified that they are not eligible for the study, and not be scheduled for any additional 
Screening assessments.  
 
If deemed potentially eligible, the potential participant will receive a copy of the ICF for review 
and invited to the site for in -person screening. Relevant medical and psychiatric records are 
required for the site physician to obtain a well -characterized medical history and assess eligibility. 
The physician may need to contact [CONTACT_773767] (see Section 1 2.0 Concomitant Medications ). 
 
Site staff (preferably the therapy team who would be treating this potential participant) will 
explain and obtain written informed consent using the IRB -approved  ICF. Written consent must 
be obtained prior to performing any tests or evaluations for the study. Discussion about the ICF 
may take place over a telemedicine visit or at the first in -person visit. If a participant fails 
Screening and is rescreened at a la ter date, a new copy of the ICF should be signed.  
 
Screening will take place over multiple visits and will be completed in -person, via telemedicine, 
or over the telephone. All procedures must be completed but there can be some flexibility in 
timing and ord er of individual assessments within the Initial Eligibility and Medical Assessments 
categories below:  
 
• Initial Eligibility, including measures, in -person discussions, and review of medical 
records  
• Medical Assessments, including labs, electrocardiogram (ECG ), and physical exam  
• The site staff will schedule the IR assessment and send IR the results of initial measures  
 
The sponsor recommends the following order of assessments:  
 
Initial Eligibility  
Qualified site staff will:  
 
• Review medical and psychiatric history with the participant via interview and review of 
provided records. If no records were provided or those provided are not sufficient, 
request additional records. Collect data on previous hospi[INVESTIGATOR_773732].  
• Suppo rt the participant during completion of the LEC -5 with PCL -5 to confirm PTSD 
diagnosis and severity. Support is needed to ensure proper identification of the index 
trauma on the PCL -5. Symptom severity is assessed in relation to the index trauma.  
• Administe r the Lifetime C -SSRS to assess history of suicidal behavior and ideation.  
• Review past and current medications and adherence to prescriptions.  
• Assess childbearing potential and discuss requirement for commitment to adequate birth 
control for the duration o f the study. Perform urine pregnancy test for participants who 
are of childbearing potential.

• Direct participant to complete self -reported Screening measures:  
o SCID -5-SPQ 
o AUDIT  
o DUDIT  
• Review results of all measures and discussion s against eligibility criteria to assess initial 
eligibility. If deemed initially eligible, potential participant will be provided with 
instructions (and appointments, if applicable) for a physical exam, laboratory 
assessments, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and [ADDRESS_1062691] be 
completed at a designated lab. Medical assessments will include:  
 
• Blood pressure, pulse, and body temperature measurement.  
• Height and weight, which will be used to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI).  
• Examination of head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, heart, lungs, abdomen, and 
extremities.  
• Brief neurological exa m (cranial nerves 2  to 12, sensory, motor, reflexes, and cerebellar 
function).  
• ECG and 1 -minute rhythm strip.  
• Clinical laboratory assessments, per Section 1 3.0 Clinical Laboratory Assessments . The 
clinica l laboratory values will not be captured in the eCRF but will be used to establish 
eligibility and will be kept with the participant’s source record. Clinically significant 
abnormal values will be captured as medical history.  
• If there is evidence of liver disease by [CONTACT_969], physical examination or laboratory testing, 
HCV serology will be performed.  
• If there is evidence of significant hepatic disease other than HCV, the potential 
participant will not be eligible for enrollment and will be advised to see the ir personal 
physician for further evaluation. If HCV serology is positive and the potential participant 
has not already been evaluated for possible treatment of HCV, they will be referred to a 
physician with expertise in evaluating and treating liver disea se. After this evaluation and 
after completion of any recommended treatment, if the HCV is judged by [CONTACT_120603], the participant may be enrolled, if there are no 
other contraindications.  
• If the potential par ticipant has a condition such as controlled hypertension or Diabetes 
Mellitus (Type 2) that warrants additional testing to ensure they do not have evidence of 
significant vascular or other cardiac disease, they have no other evidence of 
cardiovascular or c erebrovascular disease by [CONTACT_969], physical exam or ECG, and if the 
investigator judges their overall health and other cardiovascular risk factors to be 
acceptable (family history, smoking, lipid levels, body weight, level of physical activity), 
they will be referred for nuclear exercise testing by a cardiologist and for carotid 
ultrasound. If these tests fail to reveal evidence of significant vascular disease or other 
cardiac disease, the person may be enrolled if there are no other contraindications. 
Participants taking one or more antihypertensives may be enrolled in the study. The 
investigators will record and review medications used to control hypertension prior to 
enrollment.

Page 58 of 104 Additional visits (in person, by [CONTACT_756], or via telemedicine) may be sche duled at the discretion 
of the study staff to collect more information for determining eligibility or to discuss study 
expectations with the potential participant.  
 
Once all results are obtained, the site team will review all medical assessments, notes from 
interviews and discussions, medical records, and measures against eligibility criteria. If, upon 
examination, there are questions raised about possible medical problems, the site physician will 
request additional tests, assessments,  or measures as indicated. The site physician may also 
contact [CONTACT_120604]. If deemed initially eligible, the 
site staff will schedule the IR screening and send results of LEC -[ADDRESS_1062692] the therapy team after the call and present any concerns. The therapy team will follow -up 
with the participant to ensure safety, provide support, recommend treatment, or schedule a visit to  
the study site.  
 
The IR will perform the following assessments:  
 
• Using the results of the SCID -5-SPQ to guide the interview, the IR will perform the 
SCID -5-PD to assess personality disorders. Only appropriate modules will be completed.  
• The IR will also ask relevant questions from the DDIS to identify dissociative disorders 
and administer the Since Last Visit C -SSRS to determine suicidal risk.  
• The IR will complete MINI interview to assess psychiatric disorders.  
 
The results from the MINI, SCID -5-PD, DDIS , and C -SSRS will be provided to the therapy team 
at the site to review along with all other Screening information to determine eligibility. Items 
assessed by [CONTACT_773768], 
but the  measures will not be repeated. If site staff deem the participant eligible, schedule 
Enrollment (Visit 0).  
 
If the results of the any interview indicate an exclusionary psychological disorder diagnosis is 
present, the Senior IR reviewer will review the re cording of the MINI and/or SCID -5-PD 
assessment. The Senior IR will invite the study team (including therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], site physician, and 
Clinical Investigator) to provide any additional information that may inform the Senior IR 
reviewer’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The Senior I R reviewer will make the final judgment on whether or not the 
participant has an exclusionary diagnosis. Participants with exclusionary diagnoses will not be 
enrolled. However, if any diagnosis is not present or uncertain according to any measure or 
interv iew, but the investigator believes the participant presents with a particular disorder, they 
may diagnose and deem the participant ineligible if appropriate.

participant is approved by [CONTACT_3433] e sponsor, the participant will be notified of enrollment at Visit 0 in -
person, via telemedicine, or by [CONTACT_756]. Medical history and medication information will be 
reviewed for completeness. A medication tapering plan will be discussed with the participa nt, if 
applicable. If agreeable, the participant will be enrolled in the study. Once enrolled, AE collection 
requirements begin (refer to Section 1 1.0 Safety ). Visit [ADDRESS_1062694] on the same day.  
 
8.2 Preparatory Period with Enrollment Confirmation  
Participants will undergo three Preparatory Sessions (Visits 1, 2, and 4) lasting approximately [ADDRESS_1062695] 48 hours between Preparatory Sessions. The minimum time to 
comp lete the Preparatory Period is 5 days. The Preparatory Period will also include the Baseline 
CAPS -5 assessment (Visit 3), which will be assessed by a blinded IR. Adherence criteria for 
Preparatory Sessions should be followed per the Treatment Manual. In th ese visits the therapy 
team will work with the participant to prepare for MDMA -assisted psychotherapy, begin building 
therapeutic alliance, and promote a safe set and setting for confronting trauma -related memories, 
emotions, and thoughts.  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_1062696] Experimental Session. 
Telephone calls may be scheduled between visits if indicated for tapering, safety, or any further 
questions about medical history.  
 
The Preparatory Sessions will be scheduled as follows:  
 
• Preparatory Session 1 (Visit 1) will  occur 0 to 12 days after Visit 0. The visit timing 
should take in to account appropriate times for monitoring medication tapering.  
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 60 of 104 • Preparatory Session 2 (Visit 2) will occur 2 to 21 days after Visit 1. The visit timing 
should take into account appropriat e times for monitoring medication tapering.  
• If tapering is ongoing at Preparatory Session 2 (Visit 2), the site team will schedule a 
telephone phone call within 7 days of completion of tapering and stabilization to confirm 
that the participant is eligible for the Baseline CAPS -5 assessment. If tapering is 
complete or not needed, the site team will confirm eligibility and schedule Baseline 
CAPS -5 T1 (Visit 3) and Preparatory Session 3 (Visit 4) as soon as possible.  
 
At each 90 -minute psychoeducation and psy chotherapy Preparatory Session, the therapy team 
will: 
 
• Record the therapy session.  
• Inquire about any possible changes in health to ensure the participant continues to meet 
all eligibility requirements. Record AEs as described in Section 1 1.0 Safety . 
• Inquire about concomitant medication use and adherence.  
• Confirm that medication tapering is ongoing or complete, as appropriate.  
• Discuss goals and expectations for the Experimental Session, following standard 
procedures and techniques  described in the Treatment Manual [106] . 
 
If a participant would like a companion present during or after the Experimental Session, a 
meeti ng between the therapy team and that individual will be scheduled prior to the first 
Experimental Session. There must be mutual agreement between the participant and therapy team 
concerning the presence of the companion.  
 
During one of the Preparatory Sess ions, if possible, the therapy team will introduce the 
participant to the attendant who will remain with the participant during each overnight stay after 
each MDMA -assisted psychotherapy session. The attendant will be an individual with previous 
training i n managing psychological distress. The site will make all attempts to have the same 
attendant for each Experimental Session for a given participant, but it is not guaranteed.  
 
At any time during the Preparatory Period, if a potential participant is deemed to be ineligible, the 
site team will classify them as a Pre -randomization Early Termination, notify the potential 
participant that they are unfortunately not eligible for the study, and not schedule additional 
assessments. The site team will not randomize participants classified as Pre -randomization Early 
Terminations.  
 
8.2.2 Baseline: CAPS -5 by [CONTACT_120606] 3, an IR will measure the Baseline CAPS -5 (referred to as Baseline CAPS -5 T1) via 
telemedicine as soon as possible after medication tapering, stabilization, and two Preparatory 
Sessions are complete. This visit may be recorded to video to establish inter -rater reliability. The 
scores will be sent as soon as possible to the site staff. A CAPS -[ADDRESS_1062697] 
35 is required to m eet Enrollment Confirmation criteria. The IR will also administer the DSP -I 
and SDS.  
 
Due to possibilities of negative side effects of withdrawal from psychiatric medications, the 
Baseline CAPS -5 should be scheduled as close to the end of tapering as clini cally appropriate so 
that participants who do not meet eligibility criteria can resume their previously prescribed 
medications as quickly as required for symptom management and participants who do meet 
criteria can be enrolled and treated as quickly as pos sible.

CAPS -5 assessment and 1 to 4 days before Experimental Session 1 (Visit 5).  
 
At Visit 4, the site team will confirm eligibility by [CONTACT_590444]. If the participant 
continues to be eligible for the study, enrollment will be confirmed (after approval from the 
Medical Monitor for the initial participants until confidence is established). If any requirements 
are not met before or during Visit 4, the participant will be considered a Pre -randomization Early 
Term ination.  
 
For eligible participants at Visit 4, qualified site staff will:  
 
• Perform urine pregnancy test for participants who are of childbearing potential.

• CAPS -5 T2 (Visit 8):18 to 30 days after Experimental Session 1 (Visit 5), between 
Integrative Session 1.2 (Visit 7) and Integrative Session 1.3 (Visit 9)  
• CAPS -5 T3 (Visit 13):18 to 30 days after Experimental Session 2 (Visit 10), between 
Integrative Session 2.2 (Visit 12) and Integrative Session 2.3 (Visit 14).  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1062707] Integrative  Session 3.3 (Visit 18), participants will enter follow -up for 
approximately 4 weeks ( ±2 weeks) with no protocol required visits until the final CAPS -5 
assessment (Visit 19) followed by [CONTACT_120613] (Visit 20). Participants will have access to 
therapy  teams for support if needed, and additional visits via phone, telemedicine, or in person 
can be scheduled if requested. Participants will continue to comply with protocol requirements for 
concomitant medications until after Study Termination.  
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_1062708] a final CAPS -5 assessment at the completion of the follow -up period (Visit

assessments may be recorded to establish inter -rater reliability. The results will not be sent to or 
seen by [CONTACT_120614] a blinded IR Coordinator to enter the data which will 
also be blinded to the sponsor. Participants will be instructed to withhold their opi[INVESTIGATOR_773734]. Although there are allowable windows for all visits 
throughout the protocol, the Primary Outcome CAPS -5 T4 assessment is targeted to be completed 
18 weeks ( ±3 weeks) (105 to 147 days) after the Baseline CAPS -5 assessment (Visi t 3) and 8 
weeks ( ±2 weeks) (42 to 70 days) after Experimental Session 3 (Visit 15). If there are significant 
delays in the timing of Experimental Session 2 (Visit 10) and/or Experimental Session 3 (Visit 
15), the visit should be scheduled 8 weeks ( ±2 week s) (42 to 70 days) after Experimental Session 
3 (Visit 15). Participants who have withdrawn from treatment will also complete a final CAPS -5 
assessment immediately upon withdrawal. The IR will also administer the DSP -I and SDS.  
 
8.4.3 Study Termination  
Study Ter mination (Visit 20) will take place 1 to 9 days after the final CAPS -5 assessment (Visit 
19). Participants who have withdrawn from treatment but have continued for follow -up will also 
complete this assessment immediately upon withdrawal.

9.1 Description of Active Compounds  
The Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) to be used in this protocol is MDMA (as 
hydrochloride salt). This ring -substituted phenethylamine has a complex pharmacology, but it 
acts most prominently as a monoamine releaser and re -uptake inhibitor. Its direct actions on 
serotonergic, adrenergic, and other receptors are considerably lower. Refer to the IB for a 
comprehensive review of the pharmacology, effects and proposed mechanis ms of action of the 
IMP. Mannitol and a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate, will serve as inactive excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 
9.1.1 Doses  
This study will compare the effects of three blinded manualized Experimental Sessions of 
psychotherapy assisted by [CONTACT_773772]. Initial doses per 
Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg MDMA compounded with mannitol and 
magnesium stearate or indistinguishable weight placebos comprised entirely of mannitol and 
magnesium stearate, followed 1.5 to 2 hours later  by a supplemental half -dose (40 mg or 60 mg 
MDMA HCl or placebo). Total amounts of MDMA HCl to be administered per Experimental 
Session range from 80 mg to 180 mg. All drug is encapsulated with HPMC capsules.  
 
Refer to Table 3: Dose  Regimen of MDMA or Placebo .  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1062713] 
been  assigned MDMA or placebo but can indicate if they want the dose to change or remain the 
same.  
 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 69 of 104 9.1.3 Stability  
IMP will be manufactured and packaged according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). 6-
month accelerated stability studies will be completed for the  IMP along with an ambient stability 
study that will remain ongoing throughout the duration of the study. All required Chemistry 
Manufacturing and Control (CMC) submissions will be made to the IND.  
 
9.2 Handling  
9.2.1 Encapsulation, Packaging, and Labeling  
The IMP for each Experimental Session will be packaged in one primary container, labeled with a 
unique container number, protocol number, blinded IMP name [CONTACT_44714], sponsor name, 
Experimental Session number , and a statement that the IMP is restricted to clinical trial use only. 
All labels will comply with local, state, and federal regulations. The initial and supplemental dose 
will be packaged separately within the primary container. There will be one primary container per 
participant per Experimental Ses sion.  
 
Figure 2:  Example Label  
 
 
9.2.2 Accountability  
Forms will be provided to track IMP accountability and administration throughout the study. 
Blinded IMP accountability and administration logs will be reviewed during routine monitoring 
visits or through central mon itoring. MDMA will be handled in accordance with all local, state, 
and federal regulations and forms pertaining to the use of controlled substances, and forms will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_773773].  
 
Each pri mary container label will contain a unique container number for the IMP assigned to a 
single Experimental Session. The container numbers will be used to track IMP administration in 

MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_1062714] and the IMP administration log. The web -based randomizati on system will 
enable tracking of blinded primary containers for accountability purposes.  
 
9.2.3 Storage  
MDMA is a controlled substance and will be stored and handled in compliance with all relevant 
federal and state regulations. In accordance with these require ments, the appropriate license 
holder or designee will be responsible for storing, dispensing, and administering the MDMA. It 
will be stored securely in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations.  
 
9.2.4 Administration  
IMP will only be removed for a single Experimental Session at a time and will be administered 
orally at the study site. All doses administered will be recorded on the appropriate accountability 
and administration logs. Only the initial dose is required to be given at each Experimental 
Session. Supplemental doses should be administered unless contraindicated. Each dose (initial 
and supplemental) will be administered with a glass of electrolyte -containing fluid.  
 
A person at the site authorized to manage and administer controlled substance s will dispense the 
appropriate container for each Experimental Session. If a supplemental dose is not administered, 
the unused IMP will be kept for accountability.  
 
Records pertaining to the use of scheduled, regulated compounds will be maintained in 
accordance with relevant federal and state regulations.  
 
9.2.5 Treatment Compliance  
Compliance to protocol required doses will be guaranteed by [CONTACT_773774]. All administe red doses 
will be recorded for IMP accountability. The IMP will be stored securely per regulations.  
 
9.3 Randomization and Participant Numbering  
Every potential participant who is prescreened by [CONTACT_120619] -approved script 
will be assigned a seven -character alphanumeric Screening Number and recorded on the 
Screening Log. This number will begin with ‘S5’ to identify that it is a Screening Number. The 
next two digits represent the site number (e.g., ‘11’), followed by a three -digit sc reening identifier 
starting with ‘501’. The screening identifier will be assigned to each prescreened participant at a 
site sequentially. For example, the first Screening Number at Site [ADDRESS_1062715] two digits will be ‘11’. The next two digits represent the 
site number (e.g., ‘11’), followed by a three -digit p articipant identifier starting with ‘001’. The 
Participant Number will be assigned to each enrolled participant at a site sequentially. For 
example, the first Participant Number at Site 12 will be 1112001. Eligible participants will be 
enrolled in the stud y and sequentially assigned an identification number. All participants will also 
be assigned a unique participant identifier within the database for use in analysis.  
 
Participants will be randomized in 1:1 allocation in a blinded fashion to the MDMA -assis ted 
psychotherapy group and the placebo plus psychotherapy group, stratified by [CONTACT_68566]. 
Randomization will be managed via an Interactive Web Randomization System (IWRS) based on 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_1062716] validity prior to randomization, the Senior IR will review video recordings of actual 
clinical int erviews conducted by [CONTACT_120622]. The recordings of these interviews accompanied by 
[CONTACT_773775] 'dual' scoring of key 
rating instruments. This site -independent Senior IR reviewer either affirms subject eligibility or 
identifies administrative and/or clinical issues that may preclude study eligibility (screen failure). 
The Senior IR reviewer will invite the study team (including therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], site physician, and 
Clinical Investigator) to provide any  additional information that may inform the Senior IR 
reviewer’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The Senior IR reviewer will make the final judgment on whether or not the 
participant has an exclusionary diagnosis.  
 
To minimize bias, protect the study's double -blind and to ensure  data quality, the sponsor will use 
a second Electronic Data Capture (EDC) database that is dedicated to the collection of critical 
primary and key secondary outcome measures, including the Total Severity Score on the CAPS -5 
and item scores on the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), administered by [CONTACT_773776]. This second database is termed the Independent Rater Database 
(IRDB) and it will be separate from the blinded, clinical EDC database in order to ensure that site 
and sponsor staff engaged in study conduct are masked from study outcomes. The IRDB will only 
be accessible by: (1) qualified, observer -blind individuals who are in the established IR Pool, (2) 
the Senior IR responsible for oversight and data quality of the IR Pool, and (3) the IR Coordinator 
responsible for data entry based on paper Source Records completed by [CONTACT_120622]. All CAPS -5 
and SDS scores and supporting documentation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_773777]. Frequent assessments o f the CAPS -5 and timely entry into the EDC system will help 
ensure that data reviewed by [CONTACT_773778].  
 
Once data is entered into the IRDB, the Senior IR will oversee the data quality by [CONTACT_773779] a risk -based approach. The risk -based monitoring methodology 
will utilize the following strategies: 1) To perform remote, source data review of the IRDB to 
check logic and to confirm reliability between the IR's, 2) To perform remote, source  data 
verification to check the IRDB for administrative, data entry, or transcription errors made by [CONTACT_773780], and 3) To perform systematic line listing reviews for data trends 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 72 of 104 and/or to trigger implementation of pre -defined, risk -mitigation strategies when specific data 
thresholds are exceeded.  
 
To ensure that all participants regardless of group assignment are treated in a similar manner, the 
sites will be required to follow the protocol and Treatment Manual delineating minimum le ngth 
of time per visit type and describing delivery of treatment. All Experimental Sessions are required 
to be at least [ADDRESS_1062717] in an advisory capacity to the sponsor to monitor participant safety, data 
quality, and review Phase 3 outcomes to ensure the trial is conducted safely, ethically, and meets 
endpoint objectives. The DMC will be the only group reviewing group -unblinded interim data. 
The DMC will not be able to recommend early Study Termination for ef ficacy at the interim 
analysis, which will be conducted after N=[ADDRESS_1062718] been enrolled. A single representative within 
MAPS will be designated to receive written communication of recommendations following the 
interim DMC review of the trial. This communica tion will be limited to the results needed for the 
decision of sample size re -estimation. The sponsor representative within MAPS and DMC 
members will sign a written confidentiality agreement in order that the precise rules governing 
sample size re -estimati on may not be disclosed to the outside community. No other adaptions to 
the study design will be made based on this interim analysis. The sponsor representative from 
MAPS will not be part of any trial decisions or administration after the sample size re -estimation 
has been communicated to MPBC who will continue to be the trial organizer.  
 
If there is an emergency requiring knowledge of a participant’s condition assignment, the blind 
may be broken for an individual participant through the IWRS. Upon database  lock, the study 
will be unblinded and participants will be notified of treatment assignment.  
 
10.0 Risks  
10.1 Non-drug Related Risks  
10.1.1  Medical Assessments  
In preparation for MDMA -assisted psychotherapy sessions, blood draws and a full medical 
examination, including a  physical examination, ECG, 1 -minute rhythm strip, and laboratory tests, 
are required to establish eligibility for the study. Temporary discomfort, inflammation, or 
infection could arise as a result of sampling blood at the punctured vein. Submitting to a full 
medical examination may also cause discomfort or psychological distress. Since medical 
examinations and blood draws are required to establish eligibility for the study, they cannot be 
omitted from the protocol.  
 
10.1.2  PTSD, Suicide Risk, and Psychotherapy  
During Screening, throughout MDMA -assisted psychotherapy, and during assessment of study 
measures, participants will be asked to think about and discuss their thoughts and emotions 
relating to the traumatic event or events. They may experienc e intense emotional responses or 
suicidal ideation as a result of recalling and speaking about this material. Even in a therapeutic 
context, thinking about and discussing the trauma, symptoms related to the trauma or the effects 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 73 of 104 of PTSD on life function ca n produce distress and exacerbate suicidal ideation during and 
immediately after psychotherapy sessions. Psychotherapy is conducted as part of this study, and 
people undergoing psychotherapy are expected to confront unpleasant thoughts, feelings and 
memori es in the process. Because psychotherapy is an integral part of the research study design, 
the potential distress arising from psychotherapy is unavoidable. Therapy teams will provide 
emotional support to participants during any psychological distress.  
 
The therapy team will minimize risks by [CONTACT_526257] a current risk of suicidal behavior. Participants with a history of suicide attempts will not be 
excluded unless significant risk of suicidal ideation and/ or behavior is detected, per Exclusion 
Criteria described in Section 4.2. Participants will be enrolled according to the Eligibility Criteria 
based on the clinical judgment of the site physician, therapy team, and Med ical Monitor.  
 
A qualified individual will administer the C -SSRS according to Table 6: Time and Events -Study 
Measures , and as needed depending on clinical presentation of the participants, to monitor for 
development and intensity of suicidal ideation and/or behavior. The therapy team will implement 
the following plan to assess elevated or imminent suicide risk.  
 
If the Since Last Visit C -SSRS reveals current serious Suicidal Ideation (scores of four or 
greater), indicatin g risk at the time of the assessment, or positive Suicidal Behavior (scores of one 
or greater), the participant will be referred for further management as described below . 
 
1. If the participant has current suicidal ideation, but no specific plan to commit su icide 
(Suicidal Ideation Score=4), the individual administering the C -SSRS will ensure:  
a. The participant is evaluated by [CONTACT_1755]/or site physician to determine 
an appropriate course of action. Findings will be discussed with the participant 
and their personal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], if applicable.  
b. Regular check -ins via phone or in -person will be continued until the participant 
has stabilized or a new course of action is taken based on changes in C -SSRS 
score and/or ongoing clinical assessment.  
c. Notification o f the sponsor within 24 hours of this event and provide a narrative 
for the AE for expedited reporting to FDA. Increases in suicidality will be 
captured as an AESI per Section 1 1.1.1 and evaluated for seriousness. SAEs  will 
be reported per regulatory guidance.  
d. Treatment would be continued when deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_120630], unless it is determined that treatment should be discontinued, 
in which case the participant will enter follow -up. 
2. If the participant has suicidal ideation, and a plan to commit suicide (Suicidal 
Ideation Score=5) or positive Suicidal Behavior (Score greater than or equal to 1), the 
individual administering the C -SSRS will assess whether the risk is imminent. A 
Suicidal Id eation score of five does not necessarily indicate an immediate risk if the 
thoughts are fleeting, fairly easily controlled, and deterrents are strong. If there is no 
imminent risk, the individual will follow the procedure described above. If there is 
immi nent risk of suicidal behavior, the individual will ensure:  
a. Participants are evaluated by [CONTACT_120631], and the therapy team will contact [CONTACT_120632][INVESTIGATOR_541], who will be invited to co me to the study site to assist, depending on 
their location.  
b. If it is determined that the participant is at imminent risk of suicide, the therapy 
team will do one of the following:  
i. Escort the participant to the ED  (Emergency Department) ; 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 74 of 104 ii. Escort the partici pant to an appropriate mental health services facility 
(e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120496]); or  
iii. Call EMS (Emergency Medical Services) and ensure that the participant 
is transferred to the responding medical personnel.  
c. If the participant will not comply and w ishes to leave without consultation, call 
EMS. Explain that the participant is in immediate danger of committing suicide. 
Provide a complete description of the participant and give any other needed 
details to ensure the participant’s safety.  
d. Notification o f appropriate members of the study team and sponsor 
representatives within [ADDRESS_1062719] the therapy team to take  
the participant to the ED.  
 
Further information on the risks associated with MDMA can be found in the IB and risk 
mitigation procedures are described by [CONTACT_120633]. Risk Categories were determined by 
[CONTACT_773781] (RACT).  
 
10.2.[ADDRESS_1062720] 
assessment that new and or more complex procedures are required in the study to ensure 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_1062721] 
assessment that new or many p rocedures, which are not complex, are needed to ensure screening 
is adequate to eliminate or manage the risk in the patient population.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Risks and Mitigation  
MDMA is known to transiently increase heart rate and blood pres sure in a dose -dependent 
manner that is generally not problematic for physically healthy individuals. These changes should 
last no more than [ADDRESS_1062722] 
people do not experience elevations in cardiovascular parameters that exceed those seen after 
moderate exercise. An examination of safety data drawn from Phase 2 studies of MDMA -assisted 
psychotherapy d etected a dose -dependent increase in systolic blood pressure but not diastolic 
blood pressure. Characterization of sympathomimetic effects among participants with controlled 
hypertension is ongoing.  
 
Risks posed by [CONTACT_773782] d by [CONTACT_773783] -existing 
uncontrolled hypertension and monitoring blood pressure and pulse, as described in Section 4.2 
Exclusion Criteria . Before and after IMP administration in Experimental Sessions, the therapy 
team will monitor vital signs. The therapy team will attend to clinical signs and symptoms of 
potential rare complications of the cardiovascular effects of MDMA, such as stroke or acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) during Experimental Sessions. Any symptoms such as chest pain, 
shortness of breath, neurological deficit or confusion or other potential indicators of end organ 
effects will prompt additional vital sign measurements, and intervention if appropriate. The 
therapy team will notify the sit e physician for evaluation if this occurs.  
 
If any participant has neurological deficits, as assessed by [CONTACT_120636], whether or not they 
are associated with hypertensive crisis, they will be monitored, as described above and 
transported to the hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_120497]. If evaluation at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147937] a 
nonhemorrhagic stroke, there will be sufficient time to administer recombinant tissue 
plasminogen within the 3 -hour time frame recommended in the American Academy of 
Neurology/American H eart Association guidelines [107, 108] . 
 
If a participant experiences ischemic type chest pain, whether or not it is associated with 
hypertensive crisis, they will be given 0.[ADDRESS_1062723] pain pending transport to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and the site physician will be promptly 
notified. Nitroglycerin should be stocked on site per applicable national and local regulations in 
order to respond promptly in case of need. If further evaluation at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_773735], they  will be well within the time frame required for definitive 
therapy. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the 
treatment of AMI recommend percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) as the 
treatment of choic e when it can be performed within [ADDRESS_1062724] ECG evidence of AMI [109] . Any participant who experiences such medical 
complications during an Experimental Session will not be given another Experimental Session, 
unless it is approved by [CONTACT_093], site physician, and the Medical Monitor.

Page 76 of 104 As the characterization of QT effects for the API [INVESTIGATOR_590383], QT interval will be evaluated in the 
event of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590384]. If at any time 
a participant develops a QT/QTc interval>500 ms or of>60 ms over Baseline during ECG 
evaluation, the participant will be discontinued from treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Psychological Risks and Mitigation  
Mild anxiety and depressed mood are occasionally reported 1 to 3 days after MDMA 
administration [49, 110] . Psychological distress from MDMA could arise from the first 
indications of MDMA effects until the last effects have dissipated or even later. Anxiety or 
distress during the session may last for as little as [ADDRESS_1062725] with 
acute or sub -acute reactions. The potential for destabilizing psychological distress will be 
minimized by:  
 
• Excluding people who might be more vulnerable to it (such as people diagnosed with 
bipolar affective d isorder type 1 or with psychotic disorders).  
• Preparatory Sessions of non -drug psychotherapy before the Experimental Session.  
• Creating an atmosphere of trust during the Experimental Session.  
• Close monitoring.  
• Phone contact [CONTACT_120660].  
• Integrative Sessions.  
• Overnight stays at the study site for the night of each Experimental Session. Qualified 
personnel will be available during the overnight stay to respond to the needs of the 
participant. Attendants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_773784] a potential Serious Adverse Event.  
 
During the Preparatory Sessions, participants will be made aware of the fact that difficult 
emotions, including grief, rage, fear, or panic, may arise during Experimental Sessions. Every 
effort will be made to help participants resolve difficult symptoms and to arrive at a more 
comfortable and relaxed state by [CONTACT_590457], including empathic 
listening on  the part of the therapy team and performance of diaphragmatic breathing by 
[CONTACT_4317].  
 
If the participant is severely agitated, anxious, in danger of self -harm or suicide, or is 
experiencing any other severe psychological distress, at the end of a psy chotherapy session, at 
least one member of the therapy team will remain with the participant for at least [ADDRESS_1062726] management techniques, will talk with the 
participant to help them gain cognitive perspective of their experiences, and will help the 
participant implement the self -soothing and stress inoculation techniques presented during the 
Preparatory Sessions. If the participant remains severely anxious, agitated, in danger of self -harm 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation   MAPP1 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 77 of 104 or suicid e, or is otherwise psychologically unstable at the end of the 2 -hour stabilization period, 
the site physician and therapy team will decide between the following options:  
 
1. If severe distress occurs at the end of an Experimental Session, a psychiatric nurse,  
therapeutic assistant, physician, or therapy team member will stay with the participant 
until the severe distress resolves or until the time of their Integrative Session appointment 
the following morning. The therapy team will then meet with the participa nt daily until 
the period of destabilization has passed.  
2. If the participant experiences severe, persisting emotional distress, such as panic attacks, 
severe generalized anxiety, or insomnia following an Experimental Session, a licensed 
therapy team member  or the site physician may prescribe a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (specifically, 
lorazepam) and/or sleep aid (e.g., zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]). The route, frequency, and dose should be 
determined by [CONTACT_120636]. If these medications are stocked on site, they should be 
stored ac cording to applicable national and local regulations. This medication will be 
captured on the Concomitant Medications eCRF. The site physician should not prescribe 
an SSRI, SNRI, or monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) in this context, unless it has 
been det ermined that the participant will be withdrawn from the study. Residual 
symptoms will be addressed during the frequent follow -up psychotherapy visits with the 
therapy team.  
3. If a participant should become psychotic, arrangements will be made to stabilize th em or 
transfer them to the ED if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98929]. Any participant who is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2770] a severe psychological reaction will be suspended from the protocol 
until after recovery or stabilization, at which time the investigator and/or site p hysician

[IP_ADDRESS]  Thermoregulatory Risks and Mitigation  
MDMA administered in a controlled setting produces only a slight increase in body temperature 
[110] . Ambient temperature does not enhance or attenuate this slight elevation in humans. In data 
gathered from sponsor -supported Phase 2 studies, it was found that compared t o placebo, a higher 
percentage of participants receiving MDMA had peak body temperatures greater than 1 degree 
Celsius ( °C) above Baseline. However, there was no strong relationship between dose of MDMA 
and peak body temperature or between MDMA dose and el evation above threshold of 1 °C above 
Baseline.  
 
Ambient temperature will be kept at a comfortable level during Experimental Sessions. If a 
participant’s temperature rises more than 1 °C or the participant states that they feel hot, attempts 
will be made to  decrease body temperature and increase comfort by [CONTACT_590459], decreasing the ambient temperature, and, if necessary, directing a fan toward the

[IP_ADDRESS]  Osmoregulatory Risk and Mitigation  
MDMA administered in a controlled setting is not expected to have any risks of osmoregulatory 
changes. Participants will not be allowed to drink more than three liters of electrolyte -containing 
fluids over the course of the Experimental Session and fluid intake will be spread out 
appropriately during the session. If a participant exhibits any signs of toxicity or clinically 
significant dilutional hyponatremia despi[INVESTIGATOR_590385], they 
will not receive another Experimental Session unless it is approved by [CONTACT_093], site 
physician, and the Medical Monitor.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Genotoxicity Risk and Mitig ation  
To reduce the risk of metabolic activation and formation of nitroso -derivatives of MDMA due to 
interactions with nitrates or nitrites in food, participants are required to have fasted (no intake 
other than alcohol -free liquids) for 10 hours prior to IMP administration at Experimental 
Sessions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reproductive and Developmental Risks and Mitigation  
Risks posed by [CONTACT_773786]. One of two studies of Ecstasy users 
suggests that use of Ecstasy and other drugs during pregnancy may be  associated with some 
abnormalities at birth while the other failed to find this association [111, 112] . 
 
Pregnant and  lactating people will be excluded from participation in the study. Participants who 
are able to become pregnant must have a negative pregnancy screen before undergoing each 
Experimental Session and must agree to use adequate birth control for the duration  of the study 
during the Treatment Period. Paternal drug exposure studies show that exposure to MDMA was 
not a factor in adverse pregnancy outcomes, so partners of participants who were assigned male at 
birth will not be required to practice birth control.  Due to the limited number of single -dose 
exposures being studied in this trial, the chance of birth defects are low. Procedures described in

adequate to eliminat e or manage the risk in the patient population.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Common AEs  
Common AEs are typi[INVESTIGATOR_773737], but are transient and diminish as 
the IMP is metabolized and excreted over the next [ADDRESS_1062729], impaired gait/ balance, and 
sensitivity to cold may be reported. Severe anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, and depressed mood are 
commonly reported in PTSD studies in both placebo and MDMA groups. Common AEs are

judgment of the site physician.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential Neurotoxicity Associated with Ecstasy Use  
Some researchers believe that MDMA is neurotox ic in humans even at doses used in clinical 
trials [113] . However, these claims are based on studies that employed inappropriately high doses 
of MDMA utilized in animal studies and on human studies comparing the effects of repeated use 
of Ecstasy, often along with other drugs. Meanwhile, another recently published meta -analysis 
has taken careful steps to overcome methodological limitations in previous work and found only 
modest evidence of ne urotoxicity [114] . The sponsor has carefully considered the risks of such 
neurotoxi city and conclude that they are minimal in the proposed study. This conclusion is 
supported by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_773738]. It does not appear that MDMA -assiste d 
psychotherapy negatively impacts cognitive function. Neurotoxicity and neurocognitive effects of 
MDMA were studied in the sponsor’s Phase [ADDRESS_1062730] on 
neurocognitive functioning.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Abuse Liability  
Findings in humans and animals suggests that MDMA possesses moderate abuse potential that is 
higher than that reported for “classic hallucinogens,” like psilocybin, but lower than that reported 
for psychostimulants, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. In s ponsor -supported Phase 2 PTSD 
studies in 107 participants treated with MDMA -assisted psychotherapy in a controlled clinical 
setting, 29.9% (32 of 107) of participants had tried Ecstasy at least 6 months prior to enrollment, 
with U.S. samples demonstrating a higher prevalence of use than international studies. 
Participants reported using Ecstasy an average of 2.3 (SD:1.43) times. Due to the known 
association of substance use disorders and PTSD, this sample was likely not representative of the 
general healthy  volunteer population but is congruent with the PTSD population. At long -term 
follow -up across Phase 2 studies, 8.7% of participants (eight of 92) reported “Ecstasy” use across 
studies, with five participants indicating single and not repeated use and thre e participants 
indicating two uses. Six of these eight subjects had used Ecstasy prior to study participation. Of 
these participants, most were attempting to recreate a therapeutic experience, and most did not 
indicate a desire to repeat this. In addition to self -report data, urine drug screens specific for 
MDMA were performed at random and 2, 6, and 12 months after the final Experimental Session 
during one study (MP2, N=12). All were negative, supporting the observation that study 
participants did not seek  out MDMA or Ecstasy after taking part in the study [60]. In addition to 
data on Ecstasy use at follow -up, AEs were reviewed across Phase 2 studies, the sponsor found an 
absence of clinically significant AEs supporting drug dependence, intentional drug misuse, and 
substance abuse, and a low rate (<2%) of secondary terms that reflect acute intoxication.  
 
Based on current informa tion, it does not appear that MDMA -assisted psychotherapy 
demonstrates signals associated with known abuse liability patterns in a PTSD population when 
administered in a therapeutic setting under continuous observation in three single -dose sessions. 
Any ab use potential and diversion is further limited since the IMP is not supplied to the 
participant to take home and is administered in a restrictive setting. Each investigator responsible 
for dispensing or administration of the IMP will maintain current regis tration with authorities 
with oversight of controlled substances. IMP will be handled following all regulations pertaining 
to the handling and dispensing of controlled substances within research studies. See Section 
11.1.1 for AESI terms.

11.0 Safety  
11.1 Adverse Events  
In accordance with guidance for the specific study site, Health Canada Clinical Safety Data 
Management Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting International Conference on 
Harmonisation ( ICH) Topic E2A: Guidance for Industry or FDA Saf ety Reporting Requirements 
for INDs and BA/BE Studies, an Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any medical occurrence in a 
participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. , abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated  with the participant’s involvement in the research, 
whether or not considered related to participation in the research. This definition includes 
concurrent illnesses or injuries and exacerbation of pre -existing conditions.  
 
Events related to planned trea tments or physician visits for Baseline conditions collected in the 
medical history will not be collected, unless there is an exacerbation of the condition, in which 
case they will be actively followed until resolution.  
 
An unexpected AE is one that is not  listed in the current IB or an event that is by [CONTACT_364001] a listed event.  
 
The site physician will be responsible for reviewing and confirming all AEs and SAEs collected 
during the study. The therapy teams will collect AEs d uring study visits from Enrollment (Visit 0) 
through Study Termination (Visit 20). Participants will be asked directly how they are feeling 
during each contact, and AEs may be captured spontaneously during psychotherapy sessions, 
telephone calls, or other correspondence. Completed measures may create suspi[INVESTIGATOR_590388]; in this case, the site staff should follow -up with the participant.  
 
All AEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_590461], if the AE becomes chronic, a 
cause can be i dentified. If an AE is unresolved when a participant terminates from the study, a 
clinical assessment will be made by [CONTACT_120636], investigator, and/or Medical Monitor as to 
whether continued follow -up of the AE is warranted.  
 
The severity of events  reported on the “Adverse Events” eCRF will be determined by [CONTACT_590462]:  
 
• Mild: No limitation in normal daily activity  
• Moderate: Some limitation in normal daily activity  
• Severe: Unable to perform normal daily activity  
 
The relationship of each AE to the IMP will be determined via analysis and the opi[INVESTIGATOR_590389], with the exception of SAEs.

ideation, and suicidal ideation judged to be serious or severe in the op inion of the investigator. 
These AEs will be marked in the eCRF with the denotation “Adverse Event of Special Interest” 
(AESIs) whether serious or non -serious.  
 
In order to assess signals of abuse potential for the IMP in the intended patient population:  
 
• AESIs involving the terms of Behavioral addiction, Drug abuser, Substance abuser, 
Dependence, Intentional product misuse, Overdose (accidental, intentional, or 
prescribed), or Drug diversion in cases that are related to MDMA or “Ecstasy” (material 
represen ted as MDMA) will be collected and coded as AESIs in the eCRF.  
• Cases of noncompliance, protocol violations, participants lost to follow -up, and any other 
reasons why participants dropped out of the study will be assessed for presence of AESIs.  
• Qualitative urine drug test data will be collected prior to each Experimental Session. Any 
positive findings that cannot be attributed to pre -approved concomitant medications or 
diet will be reviewed by [CONTACT_773787].  
 
If an AESI is a SAE (Serious Adverse Event ) or if it involves suicide risk, it should be reported 
to the sponsor with a narrative via the eCRF within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the event.  
 
11.1.2  Serious Adverse Eve nts 
In accordance with guidance for the specific study site, Health Canada Clinical Safety Data 
Management Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting ICH Topic E2A: Guidance for 
Industry or FDA Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studie s, an SAE is defined 
as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening (i.e., the participant was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); it does not refer to  an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e. the event causes substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to  conduct normal life functions).  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  
• Is an important and significant medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or resulting in death  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed above.  
 
AEs which do not fall into these categories are defined as non -serious. It shou ld be noted that a 
severe Adverse Event need not be serious in nature and that a SAE need not, by [CONTACT_108], be 
severe.

physician, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_150830] a result of participation in the 
clinical trial.  
 
All SAEs will be collected from enrollment through Study Termination. All SAEs which occur 
during the course of the trial, whether considered to be associated with IMP or not, must be 
reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the site staff’s awareness of occurrence. Reporting 
procedures will be provided to the site. All SAEs will be assessed f or relationship, expectedness 
and any required actions to address safety at the time of reporting of the event. SAEs will be

[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Outcome  
The primary analysis will be conducted after all participants complete Stud y Termination (V20) 
and the study database has been locked. The de jure estimand  of treatment efficacy will be used 
to estimate the causal effect of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy on PTSD symptom severity in the 
intended population of patients with PTSD from any cause. All efficacy analyses will be based on 
the mITT analysis set. The primary treatment comparison will be made at a 2 -sided, 0.0499 level 
of alpha. The primary estimator of effects of initially randomized treatments will be the 
difference between g roups in mean change in CAPS -5 Total Severity Scores from Baseline to 18 
weeks after randomization (Visit 19). Least squares means from a restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML) -based MMRM will be used to compare treatment groups at Visit 19. Baseline CAPS -5 
Total Severity Score and dissociative subtype based on CAPS -5 will be included as covariates in 
the MMRM model. CAPS -5 data collected after treatment discontinuation will not be included in 
the de jure estimand. Missing data will not be imputed. Details of  analysis of are described in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Outcome  
If the primary null hypothesis is rejected, overall change in SDS item scores from Visit 3 
(Baseline) to Visit [ADDRESS_1062746]. Details of analy sis are 
described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exploratory Secondary Outcomes  
Longitudinal CAPS -[ADDRESS_1062747]. Cohen’s d IGPP effect size of MDMA will be estimated 
using Cohen’s techniques.  
 
An exploratory responder analysis wil l further characterize clinical significance of PTSD 
treatment effect in the mITT set after each Experimental Session based on the following 
categories:  
 
• Treatment Response: 10 -point or greater reduction in CAPS -5 Total Severity Score  
• Loss of Diagnosis: 10 -point or greater reduction in CAPS -5 Total Severity Score and no 
longer meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria on CAPS -5 
• Remission: CAPS -5 Total Severity Score of 11 or less and no longer meeting PTSD 
diagnostic criteria on CAPS -5 
 
Exploratory sub -group analyse s may be conducted when possible to evaluate efficacy by 
[CONTACT_773790] (e.g. , age, gender, ethnicity, index 
trauma, dissociative subtype of PTSD, presence of secondary traumatic stressors during the 
assessment p eriod with LEC -5, medication tapering, diagnosis of comorbid depression, diagnosis

independent DMC statistician will perform the unblinded administrative interim analysis as 
described in the DMC Charter. In addition, procedures will be developed to ensure the blinding of 
the participant level data fo r parties outside of the Independent Statistical Group (ISG).  
 
Based on the result of calculating conditional power using the estimated effect size from the first 
60% of participants in the mITT set, the sample size may be increased. The DMC will review t he 
group -unblinded interim analysis results provided by [CONTACT_773791]. The designated sponsor 
representative from MAPS will provide written information to the t rial organizer delegate of 
MPBC indicating how many participants, if any, to add but will not provide any information on 
the corresponding conditional power the additional participants are being added to achieve. Only 
the re -estimation of sample size will be completed at the interim analysis, this will not be used to 
drop or add treatment arms or doses, change entry criteria, change randomization ratio or change 
Primary Endpoint. The sponsor representative from MAPS will not be part of any trial decisions 
or administration after the sample size re -estimation has been communicated to MPBC who will 
continue to be the trial organizer. The full details of the interim analysis plan are described in the

The objective of the DMC Charter is to outline the specific purposes and functions of the DMC.  
In addition, it describes the procedures for dat a abstraction and data delivery conventions to and 
from the DMC members for review purposes. Access to the DMC charter will be restricted to the 
DMC and only limited specified sponsor staff who were involved in the trial design.  
 
The DMC will periodically receive blinded safety reports and may receive aggregate data on the 
key secondary outcome measure, the SDS, to assess suitability of continuation of the study based 
on the risk/benefit profile. The objective of the DMC safety review is to monitor the safe ty of the 
subjects enrolled and to be enrolled in the study.  
 
A single representative within MAPS will be designated to receive written communication of 
recommendations following the interim DMC review of the trial. This communication will be 
limited to the DMC recommendation needed for the decision of sample size re -estimation. The 
sponsor representative within MAPS and DMC members will sign a written confidentiality 
agreement in order that the precise rules governing sample size re -estimation may not be 
disclosed to the outside community, including the trial organiz er MPBC.

15.1 Ethics  
This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented and reported in  accordance with the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
with applicable local regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal 
Regulations Title 21) and with the ethical prin ciples laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
 
The protocol and the ICF must be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted institutional 
review board (IRB) or ethics committee and national regulatory agency (FDA, Health Canada, or 
Israeli Ministry  of Health) before study start. Signed and dated documentation of approvals must 
be provided to the sponsor. Prior to study start, the investigator is required to sign a signature 
[CONTACT_773798] e documents and all 
of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data 
and records to the sponsor.

medical records to assess protocol eligibility, if needed. Information necessary for protocol 
participation includes past medical history, psychiatric interview, physical examination, and 
clinical laboratory tests.  
 
Eligible participants may only be included in the study after signing the IRB approved ICF. 
Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study -specific procedures (i.e. , all of 
the procedures described in the prot ocol beyond phone screening). The process of obtaining 
informed consent should be documented in the participant’s source records. The study staff will 
provide a copy of the signed ICF to the participant and will maintain the original in the ISF.  
 
The writt en ICF and any other written information to be provided to participants should be 
revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the 
participant’s consent. Any revised ICF and written information should receive approva l from an 
IRB before use. The participant should be informed in a timely manner if new information 
becomes available that may affect the decision to take part or continue in the study. The 
communication of this information should be documented. Participant s can withdraw consent at 
any time without prejudice. If a participant withdraws consent but does not revoke the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization, the study team will have 
full access to their medical records, inclu ding Study Termination visit information. If a 
participant revokes only the HIPAA authorization, the study team will have full access to all 
medical records prior to the date and time of revocation.  
 
If a participant fails Screening and is rescreened at a later date, a new copy of the ICF should be 
signed.

system to develop and evaluate strategies for correction across sites. Sites will be monitored as 
appropriate for the rate of enrollment to comply with GCP guidelines and to ensure validity of 
study data. During each monitoring visit, source data verification will be performed to ensure 
compliance, including accurate and complete recording of data on eCRFs, source records, and 
IMP accountability records. An eCRF collation will be completed for each participant enr olled 
within the EDC system.  
 
CAPS -5 results will not be sent to site staff but instead will be sent to the IR Coordinator. The IR 
Coordinator will be responsible for review and data entry of the CAPS -5 source records into 
CAPS -5 eCRFs which will be blind ed to sponsor and site personnel during the study.  
 
Videos from selected sessions will be reviewed for adherence to the Treatment Manual as 
described in Section 6.4. Findings from video reviews may be discussed  with therapy teams as 
needed to ensure continued adherence to the protocol.  
 
During or after the study, the regulatory authorities, the IRB, and/or representatives of the 
sponsor may request access to all source documents, eCRFs, and other protocol docume ntation 
for on -site audit or inspection. Monitoring and auditing procedures will be supplied in a separate 
document.

FDA regulations, and Health Canada Guidance for Records Related to Clinical Trials (GUIDE -
0068) in a secure and safe facility. The investigator must consult a representative of the sponsor 
before disposal of any study r ecords. “Essential documents” are defined as documents that 
individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data 
produced. These documents will be filed according to ICH -GCP regulations in the ISF. It is the  
responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator or institution when these documents no 
longer need to be retained.  
 
15.7 Publication Policy  
The sponsor recognizes the importance of communicating medical research and scientific data 
and their obligations to participants enrolled in a study and therefore, encourage publication of 
such material in reputable scientific journals and at professional and/or academic seminars or 
conferences. For multi -center studies, it is intended that the first publ ication of the study’s 
primary clinical data be co -authored by [CONTACT_773793]. Inclusion of Clinical Investigators in the authorship of any multi -
center publication will be based upon substant ial contribution to the design, analysis, 
interpretation of data, drafting and/or critically revising any manuscript(s) derived from the 
Study. All publications will follow ICMJE Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, 
Editing, and Publication of Schol arly Work in Medical Journals, unless other guidelines are 
required by [CONTACT_18038]. It is understood by [CONTACT_773794]. To allow for 
the use of information derived from the study, it is understood that the investigators are obliged to 
provide the sponsor with complete test results, all study data, and acc ess to all study records. It is 
mandatory that all data analysis is done on the official monitored sponsor database and that the 
analysis plan is agreed upon with the sponsor statistician.  
 
Any results of medical investigations with the sponsor and/or publ ication/lecture/manuscripts 
based thereon shall be exchanged and discussed by [CONTACT_590470]. Due regard shall be given to the sponsor's legitimate 
interests, e.g. , manuscript authorship, ob taining optimal patient protection, coordinating and 
maintaining submissions to health authorities, and coordinating with other ongoing studies in the 
same field. The full details of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and 
presen tations based on the data from this trial will be described in the Clinical Trial Agreement.

IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: 22 May 2020  
 
Page 101 of 104 Appendix A: Sub -study without Overnight Stays  
 
Rationale  
 
This sub -study to the MAPP1 protocol “A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, 
Multi -Site Phase 3 Study of the Efficacy and Safe ty of Manualized MDMA -Assisted 
Psychotherapy for the Treatment of Severe Posttraumatic Stress Disorder" allows participants to 
be discharged in the evening after the Experimental Session is over at two investigational study 
sites. In MAPS’ Phase [ADDRESS_1062778] from the distractions of home, and to facilitate the logistics of 
participation in the integrative visit at the site on the day following the Experimental Session. The 
overnight stay is not required  for medical reasons, but in case of emergencies, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_590402] -call for all sites.  
 
In the main study protocol, a Night Attendant accompanies the participant during the overnight 
stay. The Night Attendant’s primary function is to ensure the participant is comfortable and has a 
meal, to provide minimal support, and to alert qualified site staff in case of need expressed by [CONTACT_590471]. All Night Attendants are interviewed, trained, and 
approved by [CONTACT_773796].  
 
Medically -trained Night Attendants have not been required for any of the five Phase [ADDRESS_1062779] arisen during overnig ht stays 
under the watch of Night Attendants.  
 
The sponsor and investigators agree that allowing participants who are screened for stable 
domestic circumstances to return home will not increase the risks of participation in the study. 
The study protocol di scusses the risk of psychological distress in a PTSD population and 
mitigation in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526197], including 
anxiety and depressed mood occasionally repor ted [ADDRESS_1062780] responded well to 
reassurance from the therapy team, with occasional use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_120530]. If needed, 
the study physici an may prescribe a short -acting, low -dose benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (specifically, 
lorazepam) or sleep aids (excluding trazodone) as needed.  
 
Consistent with the main study protocol and the sub -study, proper preparation and follow -up 
support will reduce the difficult ies participants might have with acute or sub -acute reactions. The 
potential for destabilizing psychological distress will be minimized by:  
 
• Excluding people who might be more vulnerable to it (such as people diagnosed with 
bipolar affective disorder type 1 or with psychotic disorders)  
• Excluding people who do not have a stable living situation or supportive family/network

• Creating an atmosphere of trust during the Experimental Se ssion  
• Close monitoring  
• Phone contact [CONTACT_120660]  
• Conduct of Integrative Session on the morning after the Experimental Session  
 
Specific to sub -study:  
 
• Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_773744].  
• A support person identified by [CONTACT_120661][INVESTIGATOR_120532].  
• The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_773745].  
• A support person must assi st the participant during transfer from study site after the 
Experimental Session and to the study site on the following morning for the Integrative 
Session. This Integrative Session will start later in the day to allow for logistics of 
transportation. Par ticipants can arrange their own transportation after the Integrative 
Session.  
  
Implementation of Sub -study  
 
All eligibility criteria from the main study protocol will apply, except for the following inclusion 
criteria listed as a Lifestyle Modification:  
 
Post Experimental Session  
 
• Are willing to remain overnight at the study site after each Experimental Session until 
after the Integrative Session the next morning  
• Are willing to be driven home on the morning after the Experimental Sessions after the 
Integr ative Session, either by a driver arranged by [CONTACT_2299], site personnel or taxi.  
 
Sub-study participants will be required to be willing to:  
 
Post Experimental Session  
 
• Identify a support person willing to accompany them overnight at a safe location o f their 
choice after each Experimental Session.  
• Have the support person escort them away from the study site in the evening after the 
Experimental Sessions and to the site on the following morning for the Integrative 
Session.  
 
Screening & Preparatory Perio ds 
 
During the Screening and Preparatory Period, the participant will identify an appropriate support 
person to stay with the participant on the evening of the Experimental Session. Participants will 
be escorted to and from the study site after Experimenta l Sessions. The support person is not 
required to be the same as the escort for the participant. There may be more than one support 
person(s), and they will be responsible for providing companionship as needed overnight and 
contact[CONTACT_773797] a ny questions or concerns. Any support person spending the night

IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_1062781] information for the appropriate support person(s) in advance of 
each Experimental Session.  
 
Orienting the Support Person  
 
In advance of the appropriate Experimental Session, the support person staying with the 
participant overnight will be required to meet with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_773746]. The support 
person will receive printed instructions, including contact [CONTACT_689039] e study physician, 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], Principal Investigator, and Study Coordinator and what to do in the case of an 
emergency.  
 
The support person will not provide psychotherapy to the participant. Minimal discussion is 
acceptable, but only if initiated by [CONTACT_2299]. The support person should not interpret the 
participant’s experience or act as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. The therapy team will discuss this explicitly with the 
support person and include this information in the written instructions.  
 
The main roles of the su pport person include:  
 
• Ensuring the participant has a comfortable place to sleep and discuss the plan for wakeup, 
breakfast, and travel time for the next day’s Integrative Session  
• Seeing to the participant’s needs for food and liquids, including providing dinner and 
breakfast in accordance with the participant’s dietary preferences  
• Eating with the participant unless they ask to be left alone  
• Cleaning up after the participant, including doing the dishes and handling bedding  
• Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_120534]  
• Ensuring the participant is safely transported to and from the study site as appropriate 
(may be completed by a separate support person)  
• Ensuring that the participant does not leave the overnight site without accompaniment 
and does  not leave the participant alone at the overnight site. The participant may have 
privacy at the overnight site.  
• Supervising the participant to ensure they do not consume drugs or alcohol on the night 
of the Experimental Session and that phone/computer time  is limited  
• Remaining sober throughout the entire overnight stay  
• Remaining available to participant’s needs throughout the night, but may sleep if the 
participant is sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_773747], at the end of e ach Experimental Session, the therapy team and 
site physician will assess the participant to decide if they are physically and emotionally stable. If 
the participant is not stable, the therapy team and/or site physician will stay with the participant 
until stable or escalate for further care as appropriate. If it is in the best interest of the participant 
for them to spend the night at the study site, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_773748].  
 
In the sub -study, if a participant is deemed m edically and psychologically stable by [CONTACT_590476], the participant will be escorted home via car, 
rideshare, or public transportation and will not remain overnight at the study site. The support

IND #063384   Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_1062782] the Clinical 
Investigator, Site Physician, and/or therapy team to report any issues. The support person will 
stay overnight with the participant and be instructed to call 911 in the case of a psych iatric or 
medical emergency.  
 
Each participant will be instructed to call the therapy team when they arrive where they will stay 
for the night. If the therapy team has not received a call within 2 hours after the participant has 
left the site, the therapis ts will call the participant and support person to confirm arrival. The 
therapy team will ask about the participant’s emotional well -being and invite them to begin the 
process of integration through self -reflection, journaling, meditation, or other quiet a ctivities. The 
therapy team will remind the participants that this evening should be an opportunity to rest and 
integrate and that they should avoid unnecessary stresses, chores, etc. The therapy team will also 
discuss this with the participant during the Preparatory and Experimental Sessions. The therapy 
team and site physician will remain on -call overnight to attend to any medical or psychological 
issues that may come up for the participant.  
 
On the morning after the Experimental Session, the participant will be escorted to the study site 
via car, rideshare, or public transportation, as participants are not allowed to drive within 24 hours 
of administration of MDMA.  
 
In the sub -study, if a participant is deemed to be not psychologically stable at the end of the 
Experimental Session, they will remain under the care of their therapy team. The therapy team 
will continue to evaluate the participant to make further disposition recommendations depending 
on the participant’s psychological condition. This could in clude: continued observation, 
psychological support and/or psychopharmacologic interventions; or further evaluation for 
potential transfer as appropriate per site Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). If the therapy 
team determines that the participant nee ds ongoing observation and psychological care at the 
same location as the Experimental Session, there will be the option for them to remain overnight 
with the therapy team in accordance with site SOPs. If the participant will not be leaving the site 
for th e night, the therapy team will call the support person(s) to inform them and arrange 
appropriate transportation following the Integrative Session on the following day if appropriate.  
 
Sub-Study Objective & Evaluation  
 
The primary objective of this sub -study will be to evaluate the feasibility of conducting MDMA -
assisted psychotherapy for PTSD among participants who do not remain at the study site 
overnight after Experimental Sessions.  
 
This sub -study will include all participants enrolled and treated at two study sites. No formal 
analysis is planned to support this objective due to small sample size. However, case reports and 
AEs collected on the night of the Experimental Session will be evaluated to support feasibility. 
These reports will be u sed to explore feasibility of expanding the sub -study to include additional 
Phase [ADDRESS_1062783] -approval.

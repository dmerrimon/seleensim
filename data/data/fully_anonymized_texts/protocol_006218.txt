Introduction : 
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality 
worldwide .[ADDRESS_222861] 70-80% of PPH .[ADDRESS_222862] up to 
$[ADDRESS_222863] established that myometrial  contraction amplitude diminishes in the setting 
of low extracellular calcium.4-7 Oxytocin’s efficacy in inducing myometrial contraction 
diminishes by 60-75% in the setting of low or absent extracellular calcium levels  in in 
vitro studies with human uterine strips .[ADDRESS_222864] oxytocin to women with risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_188804],  warrants a large study for  efficac y in the prevention of uterine 
atony. We hypothesize t hat providing calcium  will augment uterine contraction and 
decrease the incidence of atony . Secondary aims include assessment of atony and 
hemorrhage -associated outcomes including estimated blood loss, fluid requirement, 
obstetrician assessment of tone. Other secondary aims assessed  include  potential side 
effects of calcium infusion including hemodynamic changes, discomfort  at the site of the 
intravenous catheter , nausea, and vomiting. Finally, population pharmacokinetics will be  
assessed as a secon dary aim to guide dosing in future studies.  
  
Protocol Version 2.1 September 10, 2018  5 
Methods:  
Inclusion  criteria : Cesarean  delivery  with at least two of the following established 
risk factors for uterine atony : intrapartum delivery, oxytocin infusion for 4 hours  or 
longer , magnesium infusion, chorioamnionitis, multiple gestation, polyhydramnios, 
premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM), preterm at <34 weeks gestation, 
and prior history of postpartum hemorrhage.  
Exclusion criteria : renal dysfunction with serum creati nine >1.[ADDRESS_222865] w ill be  provided a brief 
informational sheet regarding the study. Women who m eet inclusion criteria for the 
study w ill be subsequently approached by [CONTACT_188807] s that this discussion w ill not interfere with case 
urgency.  Not all women who me et study inclusion criteria w ill be approached; the 
patients included in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] w ill be a convenience sample approached when the 
clinical service allo ws.  
As part of consent, women w ill be asked if they w ill permit the team to draw 3 
blood specimens for ionized calcium assessment and nested pharmacokinetic analysis;  
however, women who declined phlebotomy are still allowed study participation.   
Patients will be informed about possible side effects including intravenous line 
discomfort during the consent process and asked to inform the anesthesiologist if they 
experience this at any point during the delivery course. The anesthesiologist is 
Protocol Version 2.1 September 10, 2018  6 
instructed to as sume all patients are receiving a 1 gram  bolus of calcium chloride, and 
to immediately discontinue the infusion if any concerns for medication extravasation, 
arrhythmia, hemodynamic disturbance, or for severe nausea or vomiting.  
Patients will be sequentially assigned to one of two  computer -gener ated random 
group s (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, [LOCATION_003] ) using in  a sealed, 
opaque envelope  system. Patients will either receive 1 gram of intravenous calcium 
chloride or saline placebo diluted to a total volume of 60mL with normal sal ine in 
addition to our ins titution’s standard oxytocin regimen ( 2 U bolus and 7.5 U  hr-1 infusion  
for 4 hours) . All participants including the obstetrician, supervising and resident 
anesthesiologists, patient , and study investigator collecting data w ill be blinded to the 
study solution received. An anesthesiologist with no further involvement in patient care 
will prepare the study solution in a different operating theater.  
Upon entering the operating room,  standard noninvasive monitors w ill be applied: 
pulse oximetry, electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate  (HR), and baseline non -invasive 
blood  pressure (NIBP).  Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP)  will be measured with an 
automated, non -invasive sphygmomanometer (Dinamap, Critikon Inc., Tampa, FL, 
[LOCATION_003]) at [ADDRESS_222866] with general guidelines not 
to exceed 3  L during the c aesarean delivery . Total administered fluid volume will be 
recorded. Co lloid infusion with 6% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% 
Protocol Version 2.1 September 10, 2018  7 
albumin is also recorded. Patients receive prophylactic phenylephrine infusion (starting 
at 0.5 mcg  kg-1 min-1) and phenylephrine (50-100 mcg) or ephedrine (5-10 mg) bolus 
doses as needed at the discretion of the clinical anesthesiologist to maintain MAP within 
20% of baseline. The total phenylephrine infusion dose received as well as total bolus 
doses of vasopressors w ill likewise  be left to the discretion of the clin ical 
anesthesiologist and recorded.  
Following fetal delivery and umbilical cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], patients will receive 2 U 
oxytocin bolus, and oxytocin infusion will be initiated at a rate of 7.5 U hr-1. At this same 
time point, the 60  mL s tudy drug infusion will be administered over 10 minutes  using an 
Alaris syringe infusion pump (BD Alaris syringe module, Beckton, Dickinson and 
Company , Franklin Lakes, NJ, [LOCATION_003]) through microbore infusion tubing connected to the 
intravenous injection port most proximal to the pa tient. Adequacy of uterine tone (yes or 
no) will be formally assessed at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_222867] and 
recorded. After leaving the operating theater, all patients receive our institution’s 
standard protocol of oxytocin 7.5 U hr-1 for 4 hours.

Primary outcome:  
The primary outcome will be  incidence of uterine atony , a binary composite 
outcome defined as any of the following: second -line uterotonic  requirement , EBL 
>1000 mL , placement of a Bakri balloon, B -lynch suture, or O’Leary sutures by [CONTACT_188808], uterine artery embolization or hysterectomy. For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], any P 
value less than 0.2 is defined a priori as indicating potential for efficacy , and thus 
warranting a future , larger study.   
 
Secondary outcomes:  
Several secondary outcomes related to uterine atony and hemorrhage  will be 
assessed. At completion of study drug infusion ([ADDRESS_222868] clamp), 
the operating obstetric attending w ill be  asked to assess and grade the uterine tone 
based upon palpation of the fundus using a verbal numerical scale score from 0 -100 
(0=completely atonic, 100=fully contracted). Blood loss w ill be estimated by [CONTACT_188809], surgical sponges, drapes,  table and floor. 
The difference in preoperative and postoperative day [ADDRESS_222869] 
of care at our institution will be calculated. The total  volume of intravenous fluid given 
from start to conclusion of the surgical procedure  will be  recorded .  
For patients who consent to phlebotomy, blood specimens will be collected into a 
non-heparinized syringe at three different time intervals: once in the operating room 
prior to fetal delivery for a baseline value, once within 1 -30 minutes of comple ting study 
drug infusion, and once 30 minutes to 3 hours after completing study drug infusion . To 
allow for painless sample collection for patients with a surgical lumbar neuraxial block, a 
Protocol Version 2.1 September 10, 2018  9 
tourniquet will be placed at the patient’s lower calf, and a [ADDRESS_222870] a 3 mL venous specimen from the foot or 
saphenous vein. The ionized calcium level  and pH will be immediately determined with 
an i-STAT 1 system (i -STAT Corp.,  Princeton, NJ, [LOCATION_003]) . 
 Calcium pharmaco kinetics w ill be analyzed with NONMEM (Nonlinear  Mixed -
Effects Modeling; Globomax, Ellicott City, MD) using PLT Tools (PLT  Soft, San 
Francisco, CA).  We will evaluate calcium kinetics using a [ADDRESS_222871] (with a free -text field) 
during or following the study drug infusion.  
 
  
Protocol Version 2.1 September 10, 2018  10 
Statistical analysis:  
A sample size of [ADDRESS_222872] likely 
feasible to perform in approximately one year or less at our institution. Internal quality 
improvement data at our institution revealed that in patients with more than one  atony 
risk factor, incidence of EBL >1000 mL  or second line uterotonic use was >60%. If 
calcium were to halve the rate of uterine atony, we estimated t hat a s ample size of 20 
subjects in the calcium and 20 subjects in the placebo group should allow sufficient data 
to show a difference between groups with 75% power and a two -sided type I error 
probability of 0. 2. 
For analysis of the primary outcome, t he relative  risk (RR), and its 95% 
confidence interval will be calculated according to Altman .13 The number needed to treat 
(NNT) w ill be defined and calculated using the terminology suggested by [CONTACT_188810] .14 The 
95% confidence interval for NNT w ill be calculated accord ing to Daly ,15 and P-value  
calculated according to Sheskin .16 Bootstrap analysis for sample size calculation for 
future studies w ill be performed using R programming and 10,000 replicates of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_188805].  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be  reported as mean ± standard 
deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range [IQR] as appropriate for continuous 
variables . Categori cal variables  will be  presented as percent . The mean differences and 
their 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be  presented for outcomes of interest. Univariate 
comparisons between groups  will be  performed using Chi -square analysis or the 
Kruskal –Wallis tes t, as appropriate for categorical or continuous variables, respectively.

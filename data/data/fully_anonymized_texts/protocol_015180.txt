1. Background  
 
 
 
A. Postoperative  pain 
 
Pain is a psychological sensory experience that is provoked by [CONTACT_525601]. Postoperative pain results from a of combination of nociceptive and inflammatory  
components.1 The nociceptive component results from activation of peripheral sensory  
neurons  damaged  by [CONTACT_525602].  The 
inflammatory component enhances pain sensitivity via release of mediators from the  
surgically injured tissue. Central neuronal sensitization also seems to contribute to  
postoperative pain and hyperalgesia.1,2 Both mechanisms contribute to resting pain is in  
and around  surgical  incisions.  Movement  of wounds  or touching  them,  breathing,  
coughing,  and gastrointestinal  motility  can all  evoke  pain.  
 
Unrelieved postoperative pain leads to multiple physiological and psychological  
consequences,  which  potentially  worsen  outcomes.  For example,  inadequate  
perioperative  analgesia  is associated  with myocardial  ischemia,  impaired  wound  healing,  
delayed  gastrointestinal  motility,  atelectasis,  and postoperative  pneumonia.3-5 
Furthermore, poorly controlled acute pain is strongly associated with development of  
persistent  incisional  pain,  which can  be devastating  for patients.6,7 
B. Postoperative  pain management  and Regional  Analgesia  
 
Postoperative pain management has improved, but remains problematic. Thirty  
percent  of patients  still report  severe  postoperative  pain,  and 47% report  moderate  pain.[ADDRESS_682043]  common  approaches  are a combination  of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_84708]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480],  with or 
without  regional  anesthesia -analgesia.11 While  opi[INVESTIGATOR_525491],  sole reliance  on opi[INVESTIGATOR_525492], sedation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_525493], and hyperalgesia.12 There  
is also evidence  opi[INVESTIGATOR_525494],  thereby  
[CONTACT_525603].13-16 An important clinical goal is thus to decrease  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_16492], consequently, reduce  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related  side effects.  
 
Regional anesthesia (RA) is a promising approach to reducing the need for high - 
dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Regional techniques can be categorized as neuraxial blocks (spi[INVESTIGATOR_361021],  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]) that involve local anesthetics injected around the spi[INVESTIGATOR_525495]. The  
basis  of regional  analgesia  is local anesthetics  or/and  opi[INVESTIGATOR_525496] - 
gated sodium channels, thus interrupting nerve conductions and rendering enervated  
regions insensitive to pain.[ADDRESS_682044] become po pular  
in recent decades largely because improvements in ultrasound technology make blocks  
faster  and safer  — and because  blocks  speed  recovery  and improved  patient  
satisfaction.18 
Surgery is associated with hormonal and metabolic derangements, the "stress  
response," which results from activation of the hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal axis and  
the sympathetic system. It is characterized by [CONTACT_525604],  
cortisol, and cytokines.[ADDRESS_682045]  consistently  shown  RA to reduce  postoperative  pulmonary,  gastrointestinal,  
and cardiac  morbidities.  Furthermore,  there  is evidence  that RA decreases  postoperative  
morbidity  and mortality,  and shortens  postoperative  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].29-32 
Regional approaches  including  epi[INVESTIGATOR_525497] “fast-track”  protocols  for patients  recovering  from colorectal  surgeries  
because  they facilitate  recovery  and shorten  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].[ADDRESS_682046] occurring  more  often  than cardiac  complications.38 Important  
complications  include  atelectasis,  pneumonia,  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_33078]  — and are 
associated  with morbidity,  prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836],  and increased  cost of care.39 
Inadequate analgesia also leads to ineffective breathing ("splinting"), characterized by  
[CONTACT_525605],  impaired  gas exchange,  
and inability to clear secretions. The use of RA reduces pulmonary complications in  
patients  recovering  from thoracic  and abdominal  surgeries  by [CONTACT_525606],  preventing  “splinting,”  and thus improved  respi[INVESTIGATOR_525498].40-[ADDRESS_682047]  
common cause of adverse events in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].58 The current national goal of  
better controlling postoperative pain by [CONTACT_276483] a quality indicator is likely to increase  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_20856] — and almost  surely also  increase  associated  complications.  
Date Oct 31st, 2016      Comparison  of TAP with  Exparel  versus  Continuous  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525489]  8 ss Both hypdrophilic (i.e., morphine) and lipophilic (i.e., fentanyl) opi[INVESTIGATOR_525499]: 1) systemic  uptake  via epi[INVESTIGATOR_525500];  and 
2) arachnoid  penetration  and cephalad  spread.  The result  is a dose -dependent  reduction  
in responsiveness of brainstem respi[INVESTIGATOR_525501]  
(PCO 2) with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. This is clinically manifested as an increase in resting PCO [ADDRESS_682048] of  opi[INVESTIGATOR_525502].  
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication which  
causes considerable patient discomfort and lowers patient satisfaction.[ADDRESS_682049] migration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_525503].62 Consequently,  PONV  remains  common  
during  epi[INVESTIGATOR_232922],  with a reported incidence  of up to 70%.  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_525504]. Delayed  
gastric emptying is caused by [CONTACT_525607], increased antral tone, and increased  
tone in the first part of the duodenum. Delay in passage of intestinal contents leads to  
greater absorption of water, increased viscosity, and desiccation of bowel contents — 
which  in turn causes  constipation  and contributes  to postoperative  ileus.  63 Postoperative  
ileus, with an incidence of 4.5%, prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_525505].64 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_525506],  thus increasing  the risk of urinary  retention.  
 
 
C. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525507] (EA) is an indispensible part of modern perioperative pain  
management  because  it provides  better  postoperative  analgesia  after abdominal  surgery  
than systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].[ADDRESS_682050] compared with  
systemic  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438];  it also decreases  cardiovascular  and pulmonary  morbidities  in high-risk 
Date Oct 31st, [ADDRESS_682051], locating the  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_525508]  (ES) by [CONTACT_104231]-of-resistance  is a blind  procedure  and is operator  
dependent.46 Anatomical  variations  from age-related  vertebral  changes,  spi[INVESTIGATOR_525509] (i.e. scoliosis), previous back surgeries, body habitus, and normal variations  
in skin -to-epi[INVESTIGATOR_525510]. The ES is a  
potential  space  consisting  of a laby[CONTACT_525608][INVESTIGATOR_525511], lymphatics,  venous  plexus,  spi[INVESTIGATOR_525512], and compartments separated by [CONTACT_525609];  a consequence  can be nonuniform  spread  of anesthetics  and subsequent  
unilateral  or failed  block.47,48 
A further problem is that epi[INVESTIGATOR_525513], with incidence of  
36%, and is due to body movement and oscillations of CSF.49,50 The tip can migrate out  
of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_525514] (resulting in epi[INVESTIGATOR_13821]), laterally  
(result in unilateral block), into subarchnoid space (resulting high or total spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]), or into  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_525515] (result in systemic anesthetic toxicity).49,51,52 All of these factors contribute  
to a high  failure  rate, reported  to be 23-30%50,53 
There  are also situations  in which  patients  are unable  to receive  epi[INVESTIGATOR_525516],  or epi[INVESTIGATOR_525517].  Anticoagulated  patients,  for 
example,  are not ideal  candidates  for neural  anesthesia  due to risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_525518].  
Patients with history of chronic back low back pain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_525519] (scoliosis, spi[INVESTIGATOR_525520]), or history of back surgery are also at increased risk of failed epi[INVESTIGATOR_274690]. In  
patients with previous spi[INVESTIGATOR_525521], epi[INVESTIGATOR_525522]; and even when an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13863],  
scarring  of ligamentum flavum often reduces the size of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_525523].[ADDRESS_682052], 2016      Comparison  of TAP with  Exparel  versus  Continuous  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525489]  10 ss epi[INVESTIGATOR_525524].

permanent  paraplegia.  Postdural  puncture  headache,  although  rare (~1%),  cause  
significant morbidity, require additional treatments (i.e., bed rest, blood patch), prolong  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127100],  and may persist  for months.[ADDRESS_682054] (TAP) block, first described by [CONTACT_525610] 2001, is  
an alternative approach to providing post -operative analgesia to the anterior abdominal  
wall (Figure  1).[ADDRESS_682055]  between  the 
transversus  abdominis  and internal  oblique  muscles  to interrupt  the innervation  of afferent  
nerves  (T6-L1) of the anterior  abdominal  wall including  the parietal  peritoneum,  muscles,  
and skin. 
 
 
Complications  related  to TAP blocks  are rare. Early  reports  of liver laceration  from 
the block were likely from a combination of landmark technique and improper use of  
ultrasound.68 The TAP block  is easier  to perform  than epi[INVESTIGATOR_95525]  (especially  with 
ultrasound guidance), safer, relatively inexpensive, and can be used safely in patients  
who are anti -coagulated. Local anesthesia to the TAP can be given as a “single shot” or  
via continuous local anesthetic infusion. Widespread clinical TAP catheter use is limited  
because  of easy  dislodgment  of catheter  and close vicinity  to surgical  site. 

Date Oct 31st, 2016      Comparison  of TAP with  Exparel  versus  Continuous  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525489]  12 ss TAP appear to be safe and effective as part of multimodal analgesia for various  
abdominal surgeries including open appendectomy, hysterectomy, caesarean delivery,  
abdominoplasty,  prostectomy,  renal  transplant,  and laparoscopic  surgeries.69-76 It is even  
possible  to use TAP as sole anesthetic  technique  in open  abdominal  procedures.77,78 TAP 
blocks in colorectal surgery requiring a midline incision reduce postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_525526],  PONV, and  sedation.79 
TAP blocks only provide somatic pain relief whereas epi[INVESTIGATOR_525527]. TAP blocks nonetheless provide effective analgesia  
and reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965]. Furthermore, retention of sensory and motor function  
lower  extremities  facilitates  early  ambulation  and presumably  reduces  the risk of falls. 
E. Exparel  
 
Use of local anesthetics in postsurgical pain is limited because the duration -of- 
action  of current  local anesthetics  is short.  Effective  postoperative  analgesia  thus usually  
requires  insertion  of a catheter  and continuous  or repeated  anesthetic  administration.  
Exparel  (Exparel®, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_426654],  Pacira  
Pharmaceuticals Inc., Parsippany, NJ, [LOCATION_003]) is a sterile, non -pyrogenic white to off -white  
preservative -free aqueous suspension of multivesicular liposomes (DepoFoam® drug 
delivery system) containing bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. Exparel is a liposome injection of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319],  
an amide -type local anesthetic, indicated for administration into the surgical site to  
produce postsurgical analgesia and intended for single -dose administration. Depofoam  
technology is base d on multiple microscopic spherical particles with many aqueous  
chambers  separated  by [CONTACT_40562].  When  refrigerated,  the particles  are stable;  but 
after injection of Exparel into soft tissue, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_525528] a period of time. The components of Depofoam particles are non -toxic 
and clinical trials have demonstrated no adverse events. Furthermore this technology  
previously has been safely used in different settings and provided sustained release in  
other targ et areas.  
Various  doses  of Exparel  were  compared  with plain  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_525529]. Evaluations revealed that Exparel administration produces dose - 
dependent  increases  in plasma  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_525530],  and that the half-life of 
Date Oct 31st, [ADDRESS_682056]  twice  that of plain  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  However,  maximum  plasma  
concentrations were similar with plain bupi[INVESTIGATOR_525531]. Studies in other surgical  
models demonstrated similar results, and analgesia lasting up to 72 hours. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_525532], hepatic insufficiency thus increases the risk of  
toxicity.  
The clinical efficacy of Exparel has been studied in number of clinical trials. In  
wound infiltration for hemorrhoidectomy, 189 patients were randomized to Exparel or  
placebo. Significant reductions in pain scores were seen at each measurement time  
points for 72 hours. Patients given Exparel required 45% less opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], and the first opi[INVESTIGATOR_525533]  [ADDRESS_682057]  augmentation,  and hernia  repair.  Surgical  wound  infiltration  was also 
studied  in 10 clinical  trials,  which  showed  that cumulative  pain scores  were  improved  with 
Exparel  through  24-72 hours.  However,  TAP studies  with Exparel  in abdominal  surgeries  
are mainly retrospective, with limited number of patients. None of these studies directly  
compare  TAP and  epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187].  
F. Pharmaco -economics  
 
Exparel costs about $[ADDRESS_682058] and length of  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] ($8766, 2 days) versus opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -based analgesia ($[ZIP_CODE], 4.9 days) in  
patients  after open  colectomies.[ADDRESS_682059] drivers of total expense of managing a patient -controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_525534] a variety of  
surgeries and discovered that 51% of the cost was staff related and 15% was related to  
PCA pumps  and pump  materials.[ADDRESS_682060] nurses and acute pain service residents for opi[INVESTIGATOR_525535].  These  costs  can potentially  be reduced  or eliminated  by 
[CONTACT_46248][INVESTIGATOR_2480] -free Exparel. More time and resources can thus be freed to care for more  
patients  in need.  
F. Rationale  of the study  
 
The recent  enhancement  of conventional  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_525536] -of-action  and resulting  pain control  with a single  
application. TAP blocks appear to be easier to perform than epi[INVESTIGATOR_71543] (especially with  
ultrasound guidance), safer, relatively inexpensive, and can be used safely in patients  
who are anti -coagulated.  
Only three studies have compared  the analgesic effects  of TAP blocks  and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_44176].82-84 Niraj et al. compared the analgesic effects of bilateral subcostal  
TAP catheters and epi[INVESTIGATOR_525537] a success rate of 78% for epi[INVESTIGATOR_525538]  63% for TAP,  although  the results  were  not statistically  significant.[ADDRESS_682061], 2016      Comparison  of TAP with  Exparel  versus  Continuous  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525489]  15 ss patients were propensity matched on 18 potential factors among three groups (106 per  
group): 1) TAP infiltration with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_525539]; 2) continuous Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525540]; and; 3) intravenous patient -controlled analgesia (IV PCA). TAP  
infiltration  were  non-inferior  to Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525541]  (p<0.001).  TAP 
infiltration  were  non-inferior  to IV PCA on pain scores  (p=0.001)  but not superior  on opi[INVESTIGATOR_525526]  (p=0.37)  (Figure  1). TAP infiltration  with liposomal  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_525542],  and 
not worse in pain compared with IV PCA. Which demonstrated that TAP infiltrations with  
exparel  are a reasonable  alternative  to epi[INVESTIGATOR_525543].

We will prospectively  compare  the analgesic  efficacy  of TAP blocks  with liposomal  
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel) and continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_525544].  Specifically,  we will test the primary  hypothesis  that TAP 
blocks with single ‐shot liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_525545].  
The proposed research will have the following aims, all of which will be assessed  
over 72 hours  or the duration  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_525485]:  
Primary  Aim.  
 
To assess whether TAP block with Exparel is noninferior to continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_525546], defined as noninferior for both pain control and total  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_525547] 72 hours,  in patients  who had major  lower  abdominal  surgery.  We

Secondary  Aim 2: To evaluate  TAP block  with Exparel  and epi[INVESTIGATOR_525488].  
Hypothesis . Patients in TAP group have fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects than epi[INVESTIGATOR_525552].  
We will use a validated composite outcome, Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] –Related Symptom Distress

A. Study  Overview  
 
We propose a randomized trial comparing TAP blocks with Exparel to continuous  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_525556] -abdominal surgery. The study will be  
performed  at multiple  sites including various  Cleveland  Clinic  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].

(4) Scheduled  for elective  open  or laparoscopic  abdominal  surgery,  including  
colorectal  and hysterectomy surgeries;  
 
(5) Anticipated  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_525557];  
 
(6) Expected requirement for parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_208770] 72 hours for

(5) Anticoagulants  considered  to be a contraindication  for epi[INVESTIGATOR_525559].  
(6) Surgeries  with high port sites will be excluded  
 
 
C. Withdrawal  Criteria  
Patients  will be free to withdraw  from study  at any time.  Patients  will also be 
Date Oct 31st, [ADDRESS_682068] be obtained from the patients  
prior to randomization and study -specific procedures. Research fellow will also apply an  
8-item STOP -BANG questionnaire. Randomization will be web -based and independent  
to investigators interference.  
Randomization (1:1) will be web -based and initiated at induction of anesthesia;  
allocation will thus be concealed from investigators. Randomization will be stratified  
based on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], defined by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_354979] [ADDRESS_682069]  monitors  will be used.  All the patients  will receive  1000  mg oral acetaminophen  
one hour before surgery and they will receive 500 mg every 6 hours for 72 hours after  
surgery  starting  with oral intake.  
Patients will be randomly assigned to: 1) Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810], 2) Bilateral TAP block  
with Exparel. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_525613][INVESTIGATOR_20856]. An in-plane  ultrasound  will be used  in TAP block  procedure.  
Once  the target  area is positioned,  plain  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  0.25 %, 20 ml will be given  to open  
the space and then single dose (10 ml) of EXPAREL mixed with (10 ml) saline will be  
injected in each side. Total dose of Exparel will be [ADDRESS_682070]  analgesic  management  as necessary  in an 
effort to keep verbal response pain scores (details below) <4. If patients would not use  
the PCA for more than [ADDRESS_682071] analgesic management as necessary in  
an effort  to keep  verbal  response  pain scores  <4. Blinded  clinicians  to the study  will adjust  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_525560].  
Other anti -inflammatory drugs will not be used intraoperatively or for the initial 72  
postoperative hours. A single dose of dexamethasone (4 -8 mg) will be permitted for  
PONV  prophylaxis  for patients  with Apfel  risk score  of [ADDRESS_682072]  of care management after  surgery.  
Patients  will be allowed  to receive  prophylactic  anti-emetic  (first choice  
ondansetron) intraoperatively based on the risk assessment for nausea and vomiting.  
Postoperative  anti-emetics  for symptomatic  treatment  will also be allowed;  again  
ondansetron  will be the first  choice.  
Measurements  
 
Demographic  and Background  Information:  
Date Oct 31st, 2016      Comparison  of TAP with  Exparel  versus  Continuous  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525489]  24 ss Demographic data to be obtained includes height (cm), weight (kg), age (yr), 
gender, (ASA) physical status, self -declared ethnicity, and the specific type of procedure  
will be recorded. Patients will be questioned for social history (tobacco) and medical  
history (pulmonary disease, kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, neurological disease,  
chronic  pain conditions,  illegal  drug usage,  alcohol  abuse,  myocardial  infarction,  previous  
surgery or stent placement and medications usage). Available preoperative laboratory  
tests and medication list will be recorded. Individual risk for na usea and vomiting will be  
determined  using  the Apfel  score.  Patients  excluded  for any reason  including  technical  or 
contraindication  will be recorded  for both  groups.  
ViSi mobile  (Sotera  Wireless)  patient  monitoring  system  will be used  to 
continuously record noninvasive blood pressure, patient activity, posture, 3 -lead ECG,  
SpO2,  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842]. Data  will be recorded  at one-minute  intervals  and downloaded  
daily to a laptop.  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_525561]  (converted  to 
morphine sulfate equivalents) used intraoperatively and during the first 72 postoperative  
hours. Use of PCA and discontinuation will be recorded.  Pain Scores after surgery with  
be measured using a Verbal Response Scale (VRS). VRS is a  scale from [ADDRESS_682073] 2 hours,  then every  ≈4 hours  thereafter  
while  awake  for 72 hours.  Extra  boluses  of local anesthetics  or block  failure  will be notified  
to acute  pain service and  will be documented in  EPIC.  
Patient  satisfaction  with their pain treatment  will be questioned  after 72 
hours/discharges using 0 -100 scales and we will also use Myles QoR scale to formally  
evaluate quality of recovery. Myles QoR scale is a validated scoring system allows  
quantification of patient’s early postoperative health status, which is also a description of  
quality  of recovery. We  will record the  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60521].  
 
Failure to meet four criteria was determined as the factors delaying discharge: (1)  
adequate  analgesia  (defined  as NRS  <4); (2) independence  from intravenous  opi[INVESTIGATOR_525562]  12 h; (3) ability  to independently  stand  and sit down  (evaluated  with the Timed  
Date Oct 31st, [ADDRESS_682074]); and (4) unassisted ambulation of at least 30 m (evaluated with the [ADDRESS_682075]). Blinded investigator will evaluate patients for discharge readiness and  
patients  having  all four factors  will be  accepted  as discharge  ready.  
Data  obtained  from electronic  medical  records  will include:  operation  time,  surgery  
type, intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_525563], breakthrough pain medication requirements, pain scores in PACU and ward,  
requirement  of oxygen  in PACU  and ward,  pruritus,  requirement  of antihistaminic  
medications,  requirement  of naloxone,  itching,  ambulation  time,  flatus,  ileus,  bowel  
movements  (first time,  all bowel  sounds  at all quadrants),  constipation,  length  of stay and 
any side effects or complications. Patient functionality will also be recorded including,  
bathing,  toileting,  walking  and moving.  
We will also record  any interruptions  with comments  in epi[INVESTIGATOR_525564].  Blood  
pressure  will be continuously  monitored  with VISI monitor system.  
Brief Pain Inventory  and the Short  Form  12 health  survey  (SF 12) will be completed  
before surgery, and at the [ADDRESS_682076]  of pain.  Intensity  is recorded  on an ordinal  scale  
from zero (no pain)  to ten (worst  imaginable  pain).  Impact  of the pain section  these  ratings  
are made on zero -to ten numeric scales running from no interference to complete  
interference. The Short Form [ADDRESS_682077] descriptive  
statistics and the standardized difference (difference in means or proportions divided by  
[CONTACT_525614]).  
Date Oct 31st, 2016      Comparison  of TAP with  Exparel  versus  Continuous  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525489]  26 ss Primary Aim . TAP with Exparel will be considerable noninferior to continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_525565]  (and vice versa)  on pain management  if found  noninferior  on each  of total opi[INVESTIGATOR_525566] [ADDRESS_682078] -op. Noninferiority deltas are  
defined  a priori  as no worse  than 25% higher  in opi[INVESTIGATOR_525548] [ADDRESS_682079] (TAP with Exparel minus continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187], and vice versa) on log - 
transformed  opi[INVESTIGATOR_525567] a linear  regression  model  and then conducting  1-tailed  
tests to assess whether the exponentiated difference, i.e., ratio of geometric mean,  is less 
than the noninferiority  delta of  1.25.  
We will assess noninferiority for mean pain score over time by [CONTACT_525615]  (TAP  with Exparel  minus  continuous  epi[INVESTIGATOR_232922],  and vice versa)  
on VRS pain score in a repeated measures linear model adjusting for within -subject  
correlation (R matrix autoregressive (1) structure) across the times. We will then use the  
estimated  treatment  effect  (collapsed  over time)  and its standard  error  to conduct  1-tailed  
tests  to assess  whether  the difference  in means  is less than the noninferiority  delta  of 1. 
Secondary  aims.  Standard  statistical  analyses  will be used.  
 
Interim analyses for efficacy and futility will be conducted at each 25% of the planned  
enrollment (N=160, 320, 480 and 640) using a group sequential design with a gamma  
spending  function  (gamma  = - 4 for efficacy  and -2 for futility).  The probability  of crossing  
a boundary at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and last analyses will be 8%, 29%, 38% and 25%,  
respectively,  if the alternative  hypothesis  is true. Thus,  there  is a 75% chance  of crossing  a 
boundary (efficacy or futility) by [CONTACT_525616] (N=480).  We chose a design with 3  interim 
analyses and a final as opposed to fewer or more interim looks based on both  practical 
and statistical grounds (allowing the chance to stop early, middle or late if  warranted,  but 
not too many  looks  as not much  is gained  by a larger  number).  The study  
Date Oct 31st, 2016      Comparison  of TAP with  Exparel  versus  Continuous  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525489]  27 ss has been designed with non -binding statistical boundaries, such that the monitoring  
committee is not required to stop the study after crossing an efficacy or futility boundary  
(i.e., it will not affect  the stated  type I or type II errors  to continue  the study  after a boundary  
has been  crossed).  
H. Sample  Size Considerations  
 
Sample  size is based  on being  able to detect  noninferiority  on both total opi[INVESTIGATOR_525568] 72 hours with about 90% overall power (90% for  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_525569] 99.5% for pain score; overall power = 0.90 x 0.995 assuming  
independence) at the overall 0.025 significance level.  In our retrospective data we  
observed a coefficient of variation (CV=SD/mean) of about 1.[ADDRESS_682080] 90% power to detect noninferiority for opi[INVESTIGATOR_525570] 0.025 significance  
level assuming  a CV of 1.0 and noninferiority  delta  of 1.25 in ratio of geometric  means.  A 
single -analysis  total of 588 patients  would  give over 99.5%  power  to detect  noninferiority  
in pain score  with a delta  of 1 point  assuming  (conservatively)  a standard  deviation  of 2.5 
(from prior studies we expect the SD to be closer to 2.0; a total of N= 296 patients would  
be required for 99% power assuming a SD of 2.0 for pain score).  We therefore plan the  
study  to be able to detect  noninferiority  on both primary  outcomes,  which  is largely  driven  
by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_8556].  
Planning for a maximum of [ADDRESS_682081], 2016      Comparison  of TAP with  Exparel  versus  Continuous  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_525489]  28 ss choice.  
 
To undertake  this form of analysis,  a decision  analytic  model  using  Treeage  Pro®  will be 
developed. A decision analytic model is a systematic, quantitative approach to decision  
making and can aid in health -care resource allocation. The decision analytic model will  
compare  two possible  intervention  arms:  A- Exparel,  andB -Epi[INVESTIGATOR_232922].  All 
possible outcomes will be incorporated into the model. Successful epi[INVESTIGATOR_525571],  including  PONV  and ileus,  will be incorporated  as arms  within  the 
models.  LOS,  labor  and 30 day adverse  events  will be incorporated  at the terminal  nodes.  
A simplified decision tree is presented in Figure 1. A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/payer perspective will be  
adopted  and include  all relevant  costs  and outcomes.  Only costs  and benefits  relevant  to 
the interventions  in question  will be included.  All outcome  probabilities  used  in the model  
will be determined  from the clinical  trial.

be sourced from supply management and verified from the published literature. The  value 
of LOS will be valued based on Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement schedules.  Adverse 
event costs will be sourced from the clinical trial where available and verified  using

Date Oct 31st, [ADDRESS_682083] clinical trial data. One criticism of clinical trial data,  
especially  when  it is used  in an economic  evaluation  is that its outcomes  can’t  always  be 
generalized  to other  settings.  Through  the use of economic  modeling,  clinical  trial 
outcomes can be modeled to real world conditions. Models can also extrapolate data  
beyond  the clinical  trial, link intermediate  clinical  endpoints  to final outcomes,  and simulate 
head to head comparisons of interventions where a trial does not exist. For this  study, 
complex sensitivity analysis will be conducted to test the robustness of the results  to 
variability and uncertainty in the models values and its effect on the choice of optimal  
strategy. The model will be populated with not just point estimates, but with the range of  
data values  and their associated distributions.  
Variability and uncertainty in the model will be analyzed from 3 aspects; variability in the  
population,  uncertainty  in the structure  of the model,  and uncertainty  of the variables  used  
within  the model.  Variability  of the population  will be tested  using  a Monte  Carlo  
Microsimulation. This analysis involves running one patient at a time through the model  
with the events based on the underlying probabilities and a random number generator  
within the model. This analysis simulates differences in populations and the distribution  
of potential outcomes including optimal intervention choice can be plotted. Uncertainty  
within the model will be analyzed using one -way sensitivity analysis. This analysis  
involves  varying the value  of one variable  at a time within  the predetermined  range.  From  
this analysis  will be conducted  where  one value  will be varied  at a time.  From  this analysis,  
the variables  who are the biggest  drivers  of changes  in the model  will be identified  and 
Date Oct 31st, [ADDRESS_682084] -effectiveness ratio between the interventions. The uncertainty around  
the results  will also be summarized  to show  that the optimal  strategy  is the choice  strategy  
in ‘what’  percentage  of time and for ‘what’  variable  values  and the value  of any additional  
research.

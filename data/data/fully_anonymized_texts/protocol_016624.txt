Page 4 of 30 (IRB USE ONLY: V. 03/01 /2021)  1.0 Objectives  
 
1.1 Study Objectives  
Describe the purpose, specific aims or objectives.  State the hypotheses to be tested.  
 
The study purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of  the Aevidum curriculum (plus/minus club) to 
improve adolescent mental health knowledge, help -seeking intentions, and school culture . We will 
partner with 1 0 high schools  for this study . Prior to the start of the 2021 -2022 academic year, schools 
will be re cruited and randomly assigned to implement the Aevidum curriculum (n=6) or the curriculum 
and club (n=6).  
 
Curriculum: Aevidum has developed a 5 -lesson 3 -hour mental health curriculum that can be broken up 
and integrated into existing school health curric ula. The study team in partnership with the Executive 
Director of Aevidum will collaborate with schools to implement the curriculum prior to February  2022 to 
their ninth grade  students .  
 
Curriculum + club. Schools assigned to the curriculum plus club will  also start an Aevidum club at their 
school. Club basic processes and ideas for events are housed on the Aevidum website. Schools will select 
faculty and student leaders who will participate in a kickoff web -based training at the start of the 
academic year . The training is led by [CONTACT_163930]. 
This is a standard orientation process that Aevidum has run for many years in -person, but has been 
adapted to a virtual format with the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
 
Aim 1: Assess Aevidum’s curriculum in improving students’ mental health knowledge and help -seeking 
intentions. Hypothesis: Exposure to Aevidum’s five module mental health curriculum will result in 
significant improvements in knowledge  and help seeking intentions  between pre - and post -survey  
measures using the  published  University of Michigan Depression Center  (UMDC ) Peer -to-Peer 
Depression Awareness Assessment  among the 6 schools assigned to curriculum only.   
 
Aim 2: Assess the combination of Aevidum’s curriculum AND club activities to improve student 
perceptions of school culture. Hypothesis: Exposure to both curriculum and club activities will have the 
added benefit of improving school environment/stigma and p rogram visibility in addition to knowledge 
and help -seeking on the Peer -to-Peer Depression Awareness Assessment  among the 6 schools assigned 
to curriculum + club . 
 
Aim 3: Analyze Aevidum’s impact on school mental health referrals and school climate indicat ors 
through faculty interviews. Hypothesis: School staff interviews will allow for a richer understanding of 
the challenges and successes with Aevidum curriculum and club activities that cannot be captured 
through student surveys, but will be crucial in pl anning for larger scale program evaluation.  
 
Students from all [ADDRESS_190320]  survey  
using the University of Michigan Depression Center (UMDC) Peer -to-Peer Depression Awareness 
Assessment to a ddress aims 1 and 2. Separate  interviews  will be  conducted  via ZOOM  with up to 
5school staff member from each school (n= 50) to supplement the UMDC survey results for more in -
depth information on school climate and student mental health referrals.  
 
1.2 Primary  Study Endpoints  
State the primary endpoints to be measured in the study.   
 
Page 5 of 30 (IRB USE ONLY: V. 03/01 /2021)  Clinical trials typi[INVESTIGATOR_44769] a primary objective or endpoint. Additional objectives and endpoints are 
secondary.  The endpoints (or outcomes), determined for each study subject,  are the quantitative 
measurements required by [CONTACT_109613].  Measuring the selected endpoints is the goal of a trial 
(examples: response rate and survival).  
 
The primary endpoint s are signif icant improvements in knowledge and help -seeking behaviors between 
pre- and post -survey  measures using the UMDC Peer -to-Peer Depression Awareness Assessment .  
 
 
1.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
State the secondary endpoints to be measured in the study.  
 
The secondary endpoint s will be  1) improvements in school climate  and 2) a greater number of mental 
health referrals based on  qualitative (interviews) with  from  school staff.  
2.0 Background   
 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps  
Describe the scientific background and gaps in current knowledge.   
 
For clinical research studies being conducted at Penn State Health/Penn State College of Medicine , and 
for other non -PSH locations as applicable, describe the treatment/procedure that is considered standard 
of care (i.e., indicate how patients would be tre ated in non -investigational setting); and if applicable, 
indicate if the study procedure is available to patient without taking part in the study.  
 
It is important for schools to seek out opportunities to expand student’s knowledge and awareness of 
mental health and suicide prevention, since suicide is the second leading cause of death for 10 -24 year 
olds.2 Schools can be an ideal setting to offer suicide prevention and mental health programming 
supplemental to state -mandated requirements (e.g., Act 71 mandated curriculum).[ADDRESS_190321] 
adolescents prefer to talk to peers about suicide and mental well -being, and student -led programming 
can help to open tha t conversation.4 Though parents and other adults who work with youth encourage 
those at risk to report to trusted adults, a minority actually do. 5 Reasons for this include lack of 
knowledge, low self -efficacy, the belief that discussing suicide is taboo, and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a peer’s wish for 
secrecy.6 Programming – like Aevidum – can aid in increasing knowledge, awareness and help -seeking 
behaviors within schools.7  
 
Since 1989, PA has conducted the biennial PA Youth Survey (PAYS) for youth in 6th, 8th, 10th and 1 2th 
grades to address relevant adolescent risk and protective factors. The 2017 PAYS survey found that 
16.0% of PA students had seriously considered attempting suicide. [ADDRESS_190322] 71 mandated curriculum, opportunities like Aevidum 
can aid schools by [CONTACT_163931], stigma and help -seeking behaviors.14   
 
2.2 Previous Data  
Describe any relevant preliminary data.  
Page 6 of 30 (IRB USE ONLY: V. 03/01 /2021)   
During the [ADDRESS_190323] questi onnaire in this study to track changes in student’s knowledge and help seeking 
intentions  related to mental health  following exposure to the Aevidum curriculum (plus/minus club), 
which is in widespread use in many Pennsylvania schools1. 
 
2.3 Study Rationale  
Provide the scientific rationale for the research.  
 
The proposed intervention targets high schools to improve adolescent knowledge  and help seeking  
regarding mental health. Aevidum was established in 2009 as a student -led initiative to raise awareness 
and reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness. Their mental health curriculum and club activities are 
currently used in over 300 schools in PA and surrounding states. In comparison to current interventions, 
Aevidum is unique in that it provides students the  opportunity to build a strong support system among 
peers. Aevidum’s curriculum and club activities provide an opportunity for schools and students to 
engage with mental health and suicide prevention materials with a student -directed method. Youth 
voice is  a powerful tool that schools and communities can utilize to make mental health and suicide 
prevention programming more impactful. Allowing youth the chance to lead and let their voices be 
heard can create greater buy -in for activities.[ADDRESS_190324] meet to be eligible for study 
enrollment (e.g., age, gender, diagnosis, etc.).

This study design is a cluster randomized trial.  Schools will be randomized to implement either the 
Aevidum curriculum alone (n= 5) or Avedium curriculum plus club activities (n= 5).  Students in grades [ADDRESS_190338] -surveys. 
School staff who  participated in the Aevidum curriculum training will be asked to complete the 
“Educator Training Feedback Survey”.  
 
Page 18 of 30 (IRB USE ONLY: V. 03/01 /2021)  7.2 Study P rocedures  
Provide a step by [CONTACT_109624] (broken down by [CONTACT_765], if 
applicable) includ ing such information as below (where and when applicable); d escribe the following : 
• HOW: (e.g. , data collection via interviews, focus groups, forms such as surveys and questionnaires, 
medical/school records, audio/video/digital recordings, photographs, EKG procedures, MRI, mobile 
devices such as electronic tablets/cell phones, observations, collection of specimens, experimental 
drug/device testing, manipulation of behavior/use of deception, computer games , etc.)  
• WHERE: (e.g. , classrooms, labs, internet/online, places of business, medical settings, public spaces, 
etc.)  
 
 Partnering with 1 0 high schools to evaluate the effectiveness of the Aevidum curriculum (plus/minus 
club) to improve adolescent mental health knowledge, help -seeking intentions, and school culture. Prior 
to the start of the 2021 -2022 academic year, schools will be recruited and randomly assigned to 
implement the Aevidum curriculum (n= 5) or the curriculum and club (n= 5). Regardless of the research, 
the schools ha ve the autonomy to introduce the intervention(s) (Aevidum curriculum plus/minus club) 
on their own.  The Aevidum curriculum will be delivered to only 9th grade students in their health 
classes.  
 
Student Pre - and Post - Survey  
To measure aims [ADDRESS_190339] -surveys ( see attached, using the University of Michigan 
Depression Center (UMDC) Peer -to-Peer Depression Awareness Assessment) will be completed by 
[CONTACT_163940] 9th – 12th at all [ADDRESS_190340] prior to completing the demographic and survey, as participants will be 
provided the Summary Explanation of Research and be notified that their completion of the 
dem ographic questionnaire implies their voluntary consent to participate in the research.   
 
 
School Staff Semi -structured Interviews  
Zoom  interview s (maximum of 50) will be conducted with two school staff members  from each school  to 
measure Aevidum’s impact on school mental health referrals and school climate indicators . School staff 
members will be identified by [CONTACT_163941].  Participants will be 
instructed to turn off their camera and t he interview will be recorded (only voi ces) via PSH HIPAA 
Compliant Zoom . Interviews  will begin with introductions and information on the project. Participants 
will have the opportunity to a sk questions about the study. See School Staff Demographics and 
Interview Guide to view  open -ended questi ons to address study aims.  
 
Analysis of Zoom  Interview Data:  
Rev.com, a professional service will be used by [CONTACT_163942]. 
Transcripts will be uploaded into a qualitative software system (Nvivo 12 plus). 20% of the transcripts 
will be coded independently using a codebook developed by [CONTACT_163943] -rater reliability score is achieved. Once the coding process is complete, the 
team will meet to  identify themes.  
 
Additionally, we will recruit school staff members who  participated in the Aevidum curriculum training 
to complete the “Educator Training Feedback Survey” . We are not collecting any PHI, nor will names of 
the school staff participants be disclosed in the u se of manuscripts/ written publications.  
 
 
 
Page 19 of 30 (IRB USE ONLY: V. 03/01 /2021)  7.2.[ADDRESS_190341] - Survey  
The pre -survey  will be completed by [CONTACT_163940] 9th – 12th at all 1 0 participating schools  
at the beginning of the school year (September -October 2021) .  All eligible students will be 
provided a link to participate in the REDCap survey. This link will be provided directly by [CONTACT_77836]. Subjects will be provided a link to review the study infor mation and provide their email 
address if they wish to participate in the post -survey. The consent process will take place prior 
to completing the demographic and survey, as participants will be provided the Summary 
Explanation of Research and be notified that their completion of the demographic questionnaire 
implies their voluntary consent to participate in the research. Demographics will include sex, age 
(in years), race/ethnicity and grade. Once students complete the post -survey, their email 
addresses wi ll be unlinked from their survey responses.  
 
School Staff Semi -structured Interviews  
Semi -structured interviews will also be conducted with up to [ADDRESS_190342], etc. (If applicable)   
Provide a description of what procedures will be performed on visit [ADDRESS_190343] in 
order of how these will be done.  If your study involves more than two sessions or visits 
replicate this section for each additional session or visit (e.g. , 7.2.3, 7.2.4, etc.).   
 
At the end of the school year (April -May 2022), students who participated in the pre -survey will 
receive the post -survey via REDCap invitation to the email provided during the pre-survey.  
 
7.3 Duration of Participation  
Describe how long subjects will be involved in this research study.  Include the number of sessions and 
the duration of each session - consider the total number of minutes, hours, days, months, years, etc.   
 
Schools will be enrolled in the study for the 2021/[ADDRESS_190344] - 
surveys is approximately 1 0-15 minutes. The duration of the  semi -structured interviews will be 
approximately  15-20 minutes  if being interviewed individually or 25-35 minutes in length if two 
individuals are being interviewed at the same time . 
 
The school staff members who complete the “Educator Training Feedback Survey” is limited to the 5 
minutes it takes for them to complete it.  
 
8.0 Number of Subjects  and Statistical Plan  
 
Page 20 of 30 (IRB USE ONLY: V. 03/01 /2021)  8.1 Number of Subjects  
Indicate the maximum number of subjects to be accrued /enrolled . Distinguish between the number of 
subjects who are expected to be enrolled and screened, and the number of subjects needed to

A total of 1 0 high schools will be enrolled in the study, representing nearly 1,000 students.  
 
 
 
School Staff Semi -structured Interviews  
Up to 50  (35 faculty/staff members from each of the 10 high schools).  
 
8.[ADDRESS_190345] ing data at each 
school .  A total of 1 0 schools was deemed feasible .   
 
When determining the number of schools to enroll , the study team took the following into 
consideration : 1) Retention and changes in school administration and their priorities, which impacted 
the ability of schools to partic ipate as planned in the context of PRO Wellness’s SHIELD study. 2) the 
number of schools which  could implement Aevidum 3) Results of a previous school -based study 
conducted by [CONTACT_163944]. (2018) that used the UMDC survey instrument. The  Parikh  study incl uded ten 
high schools and found a number of significant differences over time. We anticipate the same potential 
for this work that will include more schools and students. We have added two additional schools in this 
proposal and will plan to keep a “waitli st” of schools interested in participation, as schools will continue 
to utilize the curriculum and club independently of the proposed study. This will allow us to replace a 
school that ultimately decides not to participate.

8.3 Statistical methods  
Describe the statistical methods (or non -statistical methods of analysis) that will be employed.  
 
Student Pre - and Post - Survey  
In primary statistical analysis, schools implementing only the curriculum (Aim 1) and schools implementing 
the curriculum and club activities (Aim 2) will be analyzed separately, using the same methods. Descriptive 
statistics will be calculated and survey items will be presented graphically over time. Mixed effects linear 
and logistic regression models appropriate for longitudinal (repeated measures) data will be used to 
analyze all survey items collected at each time point. The models will contain a fixed effect for time (pre 
vs. post) and random effects for school and student. The parameter for time is the primary parameter of 
interest in the model, as it indicates the change over time with intervention implementation. Parameter 
estimates and standard erro rs from the models will be reported along with corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals and p -values.  
 
In secondary statistical analysis, we will compare the curriculum -only schools to the curriculum plus club 
activities schools directly.  
Page 21 of 30 (IRB USE ONLY: V. 03/01 /2021)  Specifically: 1) Compare students from schools in Aim 1 (curriculum only) to those in Aim 2 (curriculum 
plus club) regarding changes in knowledge, help -seeking behavior, school environment/stigma and 
program visibility.  
2) Compare the impact on 9th graders  in curriculum schools versus 9th graders in curriculum plus club 
schools.   
 
The same mixed effects regression models will be used for each survey item, except that the model will 
also include fixed effects for group (curriculum -only vs. curriculum plus cl ub activities) and a group by [CONTACT_163945]. A positive interaction e ffect indicates that schools which  implemented curriculum and 
club activities had larger changes over time than curriculum alone.  
 
School Staff Semi -structured Interviews  
Interviews will be analyzed to determine themes and Aevidum curriculum/club impact  (Aim 3) . Guided by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stuckey’s qualitative analysis expertise, thematic categories will be developed by [CONTACT_163946]. Themes will be compared and contrasted to illustrate impacts of 
Aevidum on the selected high schools .

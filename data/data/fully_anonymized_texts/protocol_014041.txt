Amendment 2.0 1.0 STUDY SYNOPSIS 
This is an investigator initiated, open label trial of defibrotide for therapy of patients with 
SARS- CoV2 related acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] ( ARDS ). The primary endpoint 
is safety and tolerability . Secondary endpoints will assess response and vent ilator free 
survival.  
Eligibility : Patients ≥ [ADDRESS_429148] exhibit signs of coagulopathy evidenced by a D- dimer  > 2X ULN .  
St
udy therapy: Defibrotide will be administered intravenously ( IV) every 6 hours 
(Q6H) for 7 days of therapy . Patients who meet defined toxicity and/or efficacy criteria 
within the 7- day period may cease study therapy at that earlier time point. Patients with a 
partial response to study therapy by [CONTACT_4475] 7 (defined as > 20% decrease in supplemental 
oxygen) may continue to receive an additional 7 days of therapy (14 days total therapy). 
Toxicity (including rate of hemorrhage / bleeding) will be assess ed. Each patient will be 
monitored for [ADDRESS_429149] -therapy observation. 
Sample Size : [ADDRESS_429150] six patients.  
Ot
her: The study will target patients with either  early or late-phase ARDS, provided 
patients have not required mechanical ventilation for > 7 consecutive days . The study 
allows co -enrollment with other SARS- CoV2 therapy trials, provided those trials are not 
also utilizing other anti- coagulant or fibrinolytic agents.  
2.0 H
YPOTHESIS  
Severe SARS- CoV2 infections are associated with the development of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_345587], endothelial dysfunction / thrombotic 
microangiopathy. Defibrotide therapy for patients with severe SARS -CoV2 ARDS will be 
safe and associated with improved overall survival, within 28 days of therapy initiation.  
Rationale:  To date, therapy for SARS -CoV2 lung injury has focused on agents that either 
inhibit viral replication and/or blunt the cytokine release syndrome associated with viral -
mediated immune activation. Only recently have we begun to realize that the lung injury 
associated with SARS- CoV2 infections are frequently associated with a ventilation-
perfusion mismatch, in which patients have preserved lung compliance, but impaired 
oxygenation. This raises a new paradigm in SARS -CoV2 therapy. Given the abnormal 
ventilation- perfusion mismatch with preserved compliance, it is thought that patients with 
SARS- CoV2 infections exhibit a loss of the normal hypoxic vasoconstriction reflex that 
helps preserve ventilation- perfusion matching (Gattinoni).  This observation in conjunction 
with the frequent concurrence of multi -organ dysfunction (e.g. renal, hepatic) and 
hypercoagulability with marked elevations in D -dimer and PA I-1 levels in affected patients, 
support a dysfunction in the endothelium, and thus we hypothesize that this endothelial 
dysfunction is a prime target for SARS- CoV2 therapy. The current protocol will examine 
this hypothesis, utilizing an endothelial stabil izing agent (defibrotide) . The agent is 
currently  approved by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA) for use in patients with 
sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) with pulmonary or renal dysfunction following 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) . In summary, the current trial is a feasibility 
trial, to assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in this patient population.

4.0 BACKGROUND   
General (SARS -CoV2):  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19), caused by a novel 
coronavirus (SARS- CoV2), is a highly infectious pathogen that spreads primarily through 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_345588]/or aerosol particles. Though many affected patients express only 
mild symptomatology, with fever, cough and myalgias / fatigue, approximately10- 20% of 
patients may develop a more severe phenotype with rapid progression to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421] (ARDS), septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 
and hypercoagulability. Older age and co- morbid conditions (obesity, diabetes, 
immunocompromised, etc) are known risk factors for a more severe disease phenotype (Chen N 2020)(Huang C 2020) . 
 
Pulmonary Complications associated with SARS -CoV2:   Emerging data from centers 
caring for patients affected with SARS -CoV2, suggest a significant component of  
endothelial dysfunction and dysregulation of thrombotic/fibrinolytic pathway. Mechanical ventilation in patients with SARS -CoV2 lung injury demonstrate good compliance but 
severe hypoxemia unlike patients with traditional ARDS, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_345589].  The severe hypoxemia is attributed to high shunt (>50%), hypoxic vasoconstriction, and microvascular thrombosis 
in the pulmonary circulation, ultimately leading to ventilatory dead space  (Wu 2020)(Xu 
2020). The acute precipi[INVESTIGATOR_345590] “cytokine storm” with a recent retrospective, multicenter  
study of 150 confirmed COVID- 19 cases in Wuhan, China, demonstrating decreased 
survival with elevated ferritin (mean 1297·6 ng/ml in non -survivors  vs 614·0 ng/ml in 
survivors; p<0·001) and IL- 6 (p<0·0001).   
 
Amendment 2.0  
 Coagulopathy in SARS -CoV2 ARDS: Incidence.  The incidence of  SARS- CoV2 related 
coagulopathy is only now being understood, with thrombotic complications reported in 30-
35% of affected patients. A current Dutch publication (April 6th, 2020) examined 184 ICU 
patients with proven SARS -CoV2 ARDS, w ith a cumulative incidence of thrombotic 
complications of 31% (95%CI : 20-41), including both arterial thrombotic and pulmonary 
emboli (Kluk FA 2020). All patients developed thrombotic complications despi[INVESTIGATOR_345591] -prophylaxis.  
 Even heparinization in this patient population may NOT prevent thrombotic complications. 
A study of 26 patients with SARS -Cov2 ARDS in two European intensive care units (ICU) 
was reported in April 2020, with patients receiving either prophylactic (31%) or therapeutic anticoagulation (69%) for venous thromboembolism prevention (Llitjos 2020). Patients 
received either low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin, with anti -Xa levels 
monitored. The overall incidence of thromboembolic complications was 69%, signif icantly 
higher in patients treated with prophylactic vs therapeutic heparin (100% vs. 56%, 
respectively, p=0.03).  
 Coagulopathy  in SARS -CoV2 ARDS : Pathophysiology . Emerging data from centers 
caring for patients infected with SARS -CoV2 suggests a significant component of  
endothelial dysfunction and dysregulation of thrombotic/fibrinolytic pathway (Hunt2020)(Thachil 2020)(Nascimento I 2020)(Huang 2020)(Tang 2020).  Severe SARS-
CoV2 infections, in particular, have been associated with markedly elevated D- dime rs 
levels, with increasing mortality as the D -dimer rises.  Day 28 mortality rates of 52.4% 
have been reported with D -dimer values > 6 -fold upper limit of normal (ULN), with mortality 
approaching 60% with D -dimers > [ADDRESS_429152] (Yin 2020). Of note, hemorrha gic 
symptomatology are not common with SARS -CoV2 infections, with infrequent reports of 
pulmonary or gastro- intestinal bleeding (Thachil 2020)(Hunt 2020) in affected patients. 
Interestingly enough, thrombocytopenia is rarely noted, with < 5% of severely af fected 
patients exhibiting a platelet count < 100,000/uL on admission (Thachil 2020), with 
hyperfibrinogenemia (not hyofibrinogenemia) commonly described. Thrombo -prophylaxis 
with anticoagulants (heparin and/or low molecular weight heparin, LMW Heparin) have been shown to decrease mortality in patients with severe SARS -CoV2 infections (Yin 
2020).  This is especially true in patients with sepsis induced coagulopathy  (SIC) scores 
≥4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P=0.029) and patients with markedly elevated D -dimer (> 3.0 
mcg/ml, or > 6 -fold the upper limit of normal).  
 
There is ample evidence to suggest that fibrin deposition is a key feature of SARS -CoV2 
related ARDS, with markedly elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 (PAI -1), 
a critical regulator of fibrinolysis, noted (Giannis 2020). A role for platelet and 
megakaryocyte activation in viral mediated illnesses has been previously shown, with 
evidence that coronaviruses directly infect megakaryocytes, and activate platelet function 
(Yang 2005) . A recen t lung autopsy series of patients infected in the [LOCATION_002] with 
SARS- CoV2 noted an abundance of megakaryocytes, platelet -rich thrombi, pulmonary 
vascular microthrombi, and downstream foci of  hemorrhage.  A notable finding was the 
lack of significant se condary infection in these  cases , suggesting that secondary infections 
were not the cause of mortality (Fox 2020).  The authors concluded that effective therapy 
for patients with SARS- CoV2 ARDS should not only target the viral pathogen, but also the 
thromb otic and microangiopathic effects of the virus  (Fox 2020) . 
 
Defibrotide:  Rationale and Mechanism of action.  Defibrotide (DF) is a 
polydeoxyribonucleotide that was FDA approved in March 2016 for the treatment of 
Amendment 2.0  
 sinusoidal obstruction syndrome  (SOS)  with pulmonary and renal dysfunction following 
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), with significant improvement in day [ADDRESS_429153] 
survival noted in treated subjects (Richardson 2016). Defibrotide displays significant 
anticoagulant, anti- inflammatory, an d endothelial cell protective properties  (Kornblum 
2006)(Larocca 2008)(Richardson 2009)(Bianchi 1993).   
Though the mechanism of action of DF is not yet completely understood, it is clearly 
related to its polyanionic nature,  interaction with plasma and/or matrix proteins,  binding to 
adenosine receptors (ARs),  and protection of the vascular endothelium.  A number of in 
vitro studies have demonstrated that DF blocks tissue factor and plasminogen activator 
inhibitor -1 (PAI -1) expression induced by [CONTACT_303921] (LPS) in endothelial cells 
(Cella 2001).  Dendritic cells, a key mediator in the coagulation- inflammatory pathway 
serve as a novel target for DF, with DF shown to actively inhibit Toll -like receptors on 
macrophages and dendritic cells (Franchischetti  2012). Following therapy with DF, marked 
decreases in PAI -[ADDRESS_429154] been reported in therapy responders, with PAI -1 levels 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_345592]- responders ( Kaleelrahman 2003).  Common toxicities related 
to DF have included hemorrhagic and/or hypotensive events, though the incidence of 
pulmonary hemorrhage [11.8% and 15.6%] and gastrointestinal bleeding [7.8% and 9.4%] 
were similar between DF and control groups in the licensing trial (Richardson 2016).  We 
are now proposing an open label, trial of defibrotide for patients with severe SARS -CoV2 
with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505].  
 
Defibrotide (DF) vs heparin for thrombo -prophylaxis:  Several studies have shown that 
DF is at least as effective, or potentially more effective than heparin (Rizzi 1987)  (Strouse 
2016).   A large, open -label, multicenter study in post -op patients (n=4810), in which 
defibrotide (n = 2810) vs heparin prophylaxis (n=2000) was administered noted that the 
incidence of postsurgical DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) were significantly lower in 
the defibrotide arm [1.17 vs 2.35%  (DVT) , p = .002; 0.53 vs 1.15%,  p = .025  (PE), 
respectively] (Gerosa 1989).  
 
Defibrotide dosing : Current FDA approved dosing schedules (25 mg/kg/day in 4 divided 
doses) were derived from pharmacokinetic ( Pk) studies in healthy controls, subjects  with 
hepatic SOS and those  with hepato- renal dysfunction (Tocchetti 2016)(Umemura 
2016)( Palmer 1993). Peak levels  and peak pharmacodynamics effects are noted following 
2-hours of infusion, with rapid clearance and short half -life (<1.0 hours)(Umemura 2016). 
Similar pharmacokinetic profiles are seen in subjects with end- stage renal disease and/or 
patients undergoing hemodialysis (Tocchetti 2016). Thus, renal impairment does not 
impact clearance or dosing schedule, with 25 mg/kg/day still administered in [ADDRESS_429155]. Defibrotide may serve as 
a potent  anti-coagulant, pro- fibrinolytic and endothelial stabilizing agent, 
potentially playing a key role in lessening thrombo- embolic disease and multi -organ 
dysfunction  associated with this disorder. We hypothesize that through its role in 
preventing pulmonary microthrombi, decreasing pulmonary endothelial production 
of inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1, IL -6, TNFR1, IL -8), promoting vaso- dilation 
(increased production of nitric oxide, p rostanoids), ability to restore normal 
endothelium induced vascular responses, inhibition of platelet activation 
Amendment 2.0  
 (reduction in VWF), and regulation of the fibrinolytic pathway (reduction in PAI -1), 
defibrotide will lead to improvement in oxygenation and promote the resolution of 
ARDS. The high incidence of renal and cardiac dysfunction in SARS -CoV2 affected 
patients may be similarly impacted.

; 
6.[ADDRESS_429156] ied by [CONTACT_156239].  
 
6.2 Defibrotide dosing  and administration  
All patients will receive 25 mg/kg/day of defibrotide, given in 4 divided doses (approximately Q6H), each dose infused intravenously (IV) over an approximate 2- hour 
period. No dose shall be infused within 3 hours of a prior dose . The defibrotide will be 
administered in 0.9% Sodium Chloride or 5% dextrose in water IV and mixed to a  
concentration of 4  - 20 mg/mL.  
 
The dose of Defibrotide (6.25 mg/kg Q6H) will be based on the patient’s recorded weight 
at the time of study entry. Each of the [ADDRESS_429157] 10 mg for adults (>35 kg) and the nearest 5 mg for children (<35 kg) in order to 
facilitate efficient drug administration. Total daily dose for all patients will be 25 mg/kg.  No 
premedication is required with  dosing. Vitals (Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_18083]) should be obtained at the start and completion of the first infusion , and with 
subsequent infusions where clinically possible. There is no dosing adjustment for hepatic 
or renal dysfunction, including hemodialysis.  
 
Administer the diluted defibrotide solution using an infusion set equipped with a 0.2 micron 
inline filter. Flush the intravenous administration line (peripheral or central) with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP immediately before and 
after admin istration. Do not co -administer defibrotide and other intravenous drugs 
concurrently within the same intravenous line. 
 
Amendment 2.0  
 6.3 Therapy duration 
The planned duration of study therapy is 7 days  (168 hours) from study entry , with the 
following qualifications:   
 
a. Patients who respond to study therapy prior to the  7-day period, as evidenced by a 
decline in the WHO Ordinal Score by > 2 points (APPENDIX 1) for > [ADDRESS_429158] not  responded to study therapy  by [CONTACT_4475] 7 of therapy, evidenced by 
<20% reduction (or a worsening) of the amount of supplemental oxygen they are receiving, 
will discontinue study therapy at that time point (day 7).  
 
c. Patients who have evidence of a partial pulmonary response by [CONTACT_4475] 7 ( >20% reduction 
in supplemental O2 requirement , but still require supplemental oxygen) may elect to 
continue to receive study drug through an additional 7 days of study  (total 14- day therapy 
course) .  
 
6.4 Criteria to Hold  Study Therapy 
 
Study drug will be held in the following settings:  
Patients who develop signs of “major bleeding” as defined by [CONTACT_345609] (ISTH) criteria (Appendix 3), will have defibrotide held at 
that time.     
Per ISTH criteria:  
• The term “major bleeding” is defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or 
organ, including intracranial, intra- spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra- articular, 
pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome.  
• Any bleeding associated with a decline in hemoglobin level of > 2.0 g/dl, leading to 
transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells will constitute a major 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], and defibrotide will be held.  
 
Additional criteria:  
• In addition, defibrotide therapy will be held if symptomatic alveolar hemorrhage, 
macroscopic hematuria, uncontrolled menorrhagia (i.e. requiring therapy), 
uncontrolled epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (> 10 minutes duration) requiring cauterization and/or nasal 
packing, or uncontrolled bleeding from a wound site (i.e. bleeding requiring 
therapeutic intervention) occur.  
• Blood tinged endotracheal secretions, microscopic hematuria, mild menorrhagia, 
and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] < [ADDRESS_429159] 24 hours, 
and may be restarted at the same dose and dosing schedule . If any further  signs of 
bleeding develop upon re- initiation of therapy, defibrotide would be discontinued and not 
re-started. Patients who develop signs of CNS hemorrhage or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage 
Amendment 2.0  
 should discontinue study therapy immediately, and will not resume therapy at any time 
point .  
 
Defibrotide will be held for surgical procedures or to accommodate other urgent 
intervention (central line placement) without necessitating dose modification. For surgical 
procedures it is recommended that defibrotide administration be completed > 2 hours prior to the procedure. The DF may be resumed 24 hours after completion of the procedure (or 
later) based upon the clinical discretion of the treating physician.  
 
In situations in which defibrotide therapy was temporarily held and then resumed, no additional doses of defibrotide will be given to account for any doses that were missed while the drug was being held.  
 
Defibrotide will be discontinued permanently for the development of a “severe or life-
threatening (anaphylaxis) hypersensitivity reaction.  
 Defibrotide will be discontinued permanently if a patient initiates extra- corporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy for any reason.   
 
Defibrotide dosing for acute hypersensitivity reactions is discussed in section 6.5 below.  
 
6.5     Management of Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions . 
 If an infusion- related hypersensitivity reaction occurs , the infusion will be emergently held 
as outlined below. One of the principal investigators, Gregory Yanik (pager 3390), Vibha 
Lama (pager [ZIP_CODE]), or David Frame (pager 1803) MUST be contact[CONTACT_15608] (prior 
to the next dose) so that the study team can determine if further dosing should be held, 
and/or discontinued altogether. One of the principal investigators will be available 24/7 to discuss potential adverse events or infusion related hypersensitivity reactions that develop 
in patients receiving study therapy.  
 
Acute Intravenous Infusion Reactions : Eme rgency equipment and medication for the 
treatment of infusion reactions must be available for immediate use. All infusion 
reactions must be reported as AEs (as defined in section 10) and graded using the 
grading scales as instructed in Section 10.  
 
Interr uption of the Intravenous Infusion: The infusion should be interrupted if any of the 
following AEs are observed:  
• Hypotension (blood pressure > [ADDRESS_429160] deviations below baseline)  
• Rigors/chills  
• Rash, pruritus  
• Ur ticaria (hives, welts, wheals)  
• Diaphoresis  
• Worsening dyspnea or ventilator status  
• Vomiting  
• Flushing  
Amendment 2.0  
 The reaction(s)  should  be treated symptomatically,  and the infusion  may be restarted  
at 50% of the original  rate, after approval by [CONTACT_30967] . If study 
investigators feel there is a medical need for treatment or discontinuation of the 
infusion other than described above, they should use clinical judgment to provide the 
appropriate response according to typi[INVESTIGATOR_24896].  
Termination of the Intravenous Infusion:  The infusion should be terminated and NOT 
restarted if any of the following adverse events occur:  
• anaphylaxis*  
• laryngeal/pharyngeal  edema  
• severe bronchospasm  
• chest  pain 
• seizure  
• severe hypotension 
• other neurological symptoms (confusion, loss of consciousness, 
paresthesia,  paralysis, etc.) any  other  symptom  or sign that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8574],  warrants  termination of the IV  infusion  
Consider anaphylaxis if the following is observed (Sampson, 2006): acute onset of 
an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or 
both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or ﬂushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula) AND AT 
LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229],  hypoxemia)  
• Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end- organ dysfunction 
(eg, hypotonia [collapse],  syncope,  incontinence).  
 
As noted above, one of the principal investigators [Gregory Yanik (pager 3390), Vibha Lama (pager [ZIP_CODE]), or David Frame (pager 1803)] MUST  be contact[CONTACT_345610], so that the study team can determine if further dosing should be immediately held, and/or discontinued.  
 6.6      Concurrent Medications   
Patients may NOT be treated concurrently with therapeutic dosing of antifibrinolytics, or 
anticoagulants, including (but not limited to) therapeutic dosing with heparin, systemic t -
PA, or warfarin. The use of non -therapeutic doses of heparin (≤7,500 units Q8Hours) or 
low molecular weight heparin (≤ 1 mg/kg/day) is allowed. Patients may also receive 
heparin or other anticoagulants for routine central venous line management, intermittent 
dialysis or ultrafiltration. Fibrinolytic instillation for central venou s line occlusion is also 
permitted.  
 6.7       Supportive care  
Hematologic: Platelet transfusions should be given to maintain a platelet count ≥ 
50,000/mm3 at all times, and fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_345595] a 
serum fibrinogen level > 150 mg/dl during the duration of study therapy.  
 
Amendment 2.0  
  Infectious disease: Antimicrobial therapy for prophylaxis or treatment of acute infections 
should continue as clinically indicated, per investigator discretion.  
  Hepato- renal: There is no change in defibrotide dosing with hepatic and/or renal 
dysfunction. Patients receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or ultrafiltration may continue study therapy without dosing modification.  
7.0 REQUIRED OBSERVATIONS  
For sections 7.2 through 7.4, if a laboratory parameter has been obtained within 48 
hours prior to study enrollment, it does not need to be repeated for study purposes and will be considered the *baseline* value. Following the last day of study drug therapy, no 
further “study related” blood tests will be obtained.  
Guidelines for monitoring hematologic and coagulation parameters were derived from Thachil, J., et al., ISTH interim guidance on recognition and management of 
coagulopathy in COVID -19. J Thromb Haemost, 2020. 18(5): p. 1023 -1026.  
7.1  Pulmonary Indices: Pulmonary parameters will be recorded daily for subjects  
from the time of study entry to cessation of study drug therapy. Pulmonary assessment 
will include a subject’s current level of supplemental oxygen support (%FiO2) , current 
modality of support (mechanical ventilation, BiPaP, CPAP, nasal cannula, or none) , and 
the results of any chest radiographs ( if performed) that day . For patients that remain 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345596] 14 of study, pulmonary indices will also be made at that time point .  
Blood gas values will be obtained as clinically indicated. Scoring from the WHO COVID 
Ordinal Scale (Appendix 1) will be determined  daily by [CONTACT_345611] , till cessation 
of study drug therapy .  
7.2       H ematologic parameters: 
A complete blood count  including platelets  (CBCP ) should be obtained at baseline (study 
entry), and daily till cessation of study therapy. Additional blood counts may be obtained 
as clinically indicated.  
 
7.3       Chemistries : 
Serum chemistries (Electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, liver panel) should be obtained at 
baseline (study entry), and upon cessation  of study therapy. Additional chemistries should 
be obtained as clinically indicated.  
 
7.4       Coagulation Labs : 
D-dimer , Prothrombin time  (PT), and serum fibrinogen should be obtained at basel ine 
(study entry) and daily till cessation of study therapy. Additional D -dimer , PT, and serum 
fibrinogen  testing may be obtained as clinically indicated .  
 
7.5       Serologic  Cytokine Profiles:  
Approximately 3-5 ml of plasma will be drawn at baseline (±1 day), day 4 (± 2 days), day 7 
(±2 days), and upon completion of  study therapy (± 2 days) for cytokine analysis. For 
subjects completing study therapy prior to day 7, samples will be acquired upon 
completion of study therapy (± 2 days), without a day 7 sample acquired. For subjects 
completing study  therapy after day 7, an additional sample will be acquired upon 
completion of study therapy (± 2  days). The inability to obtain these ancillary tests on the 
specified days will not be considered a protocol  violation.  
Amendment 2.0  
  
7.6     Biomarkers of hemostasis and endothelial dysfunction:   
Biomarkers of hemostasis and endothelial dysfunction will be obtained from the 3-5 ml of 
plasma as described in section 7.5.  Serologic biomarkers of hemostasis and endothelial 
dysfunction may include (but are not limited t o): PAI -1, Protein C, tPA, VWF . The inability 
to obtain these ancillary tests on the specified days will not be considered a protocol  
violation . 
 
For subjects completing study therapy prior to day 7, samples will be acquired upon 
completion of study therapy (± 2 days), without a day 7 sample acquired. For subjects 
completing study therapy on day 7, samples will be acquired at baseline, day 4 (± 2 days) 
and day 7 (± 2 days) of therapy.  For subjects completing study therapy after day 7, 
samples will be acquired at baseline, day 4 (±2 days), day  7 (±2 days), and upon 
completion of study therapy (± 2 days).

Notes:  
a, Laboratory tests performed within 48 hours prior to study entry do not need to be repeated at baseline.  
The D- Dimer, serum fibrinogen , PT and CBCP should be performed daily (till cessation of study drug 
therapy), and should be viewed as standard medical care.  Arterial  blood gas (ABG) measurements, and 
chest radiographs should be performed per routine medical care. Patients who continue therapy beyond day 7, should continue to have laboratory tests performed (as indicated above) till cessation of study 
therapy.  
b, Chest XRay (CXR): The CXR does not need to be repeated at baseline, if a CXR was done on admission 
and revealed bilateral infiltrates.  
c. Biomarkers . Five ml of plasma will be drawn at baseline (±1 day), day 4 (±1 day), day 7 (±1 day), and

g. Vital signs: heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure prior to and upon completion of the first infusion, 
and if clinically possible  with subsequent infusions .  
h. Adverse Eve nt Reporting and Follow -up: Patients will be assessed for adverse events daily during receipt 
of study therapy , and for [ADDRESS_429163]-therapy period .  In addition, patients will be c ontacted 30 days (±2  days) 
after receiving the last dose of study therapy, to assess their clinical status  and any active adverse events 
at that time. This final assessment can be done virtually , by [CONTACT_345612] (email) if the patient 
cannot be contact[CONTACT_3012]. No in -person visit is required.  
8.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  
We are proposing a single arm, single center open label trial to assess the safety and 
tolerability of defibrotide for patients with SARS -CoV2 induc ed ARDS.  
8.[ADDRESS_429164] to accrue in the 
current setting of the SARS -CoV2 pandemic.   
8.3       Primary stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_345598] > 20% hemorrhagic complications would be unacceptable in this setting.  Thus, we will continually monitor the observed proportion of patients with major bleeding 
complications.  We start with prior Beta(2,8) distribution, which has mean 0.2.  If ever we 
have more than 80% posterior probability that the true proportion is greater than 0.20, 
Amendment 2.[ADDRESS_429165] eleven patients, the 
study will be suspended. If the true proportion of major bleeding events is 0.20, the study has a probability of 0.19 of being suspended.  If the true proportion of major bleeding 
events is 0.30 or 0.40, the probability of trial suspension is 0.47 and 0.73, respectively.  
Note that if the trial is suspended to accrual, the accrual is expected to be seven patients.  
8.4       Secondary  endpoints  
There are two secondary endpoints: (i) Day 14 overall survival and (ii) Day [ADDRESS_429166] 95% confidence interval.  
We will also continually monitor the study for excessive Day [ADDRESS_429167] eleven patients.   If the true Day 
14 mortality rate is 70% (which is the historical rate for patients with respi[INVESTIGATOR_345599]), the study has a probability of 0.80 of being suspended.  Conversely, if the Day 14 mortality rate is 50%, the study has a much lower probability of 0.[ADDRESS_429168] one dose of the study drug (defibrotide) would be considered evaluable for the primary and secondary study endpoints. Subjects who die following 
consent, but prior to initiation of the study therapy (defibrotide), are not evaluable for 
safety, and will be replaced on study.  
9.0 OFF STUDY CRITERIA   
Defibrotide will be discontinued fo r any of the following reasons : 
• Withdrawal of consent / patient choice.  
• The patient experiences an adverse event which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14270], 
contraindi cates continuation in the study.   
• Protocol violation, including disallowed concomitant therapy.  
• The Investigator considers it not in the patient’s best interest to continue.  
• Defibrotide -related toxicity  (including hemorrhage as defined in section 6.4)   
• Subject death.  
10.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
10.1  Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents.  
Amendment 2.0  
 10.2 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
The descriptions and grading scales used in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. The CTCAE v5.0 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_345600]: 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Q
uick_Reference_5x7.pdf  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade  (severity); 2) the relationship to the study therapy  
(attribution); and 3) the prior experience (expectedness) of the adverse event.  
Adverse events (AE) refer to any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention- related (21 CFR 312.32 
(a)). By [CONTACT_204112], an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of the Study Drug .  
Protocol -defined and serious AE wil l collected for [ADDRESS_429169]. In addition, patients with drug related 
AE will be monitored until symptom resolution, even if the symptoms extend beyond the 
30-day period.  
AEs may include:  
• Exacerbation (i.e., an increase in the frequency or severity) of a pre- existing 
condition. Illness present before study entry should be recorded in the medical history 
section of the CRF and only be reported as an AE if there is an increase in frequency 
or severity of the condition during the study.  
• Intercurrent illnesses with an onset after administration of defibrotide begins. 
 
AEs DO NOT include:  
• Any medical condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before initial study 
treatment is considered to be pre -existing in nature. Any known pre -existing 
conditions that are ongoing at time of study entry should be considered medical 
history.   
• Medical or surgical procedures (the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE)  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not taken place. For example:  
- Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254785] -existing conditions, which have not worsened. 
- Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254786]. 
- Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345601] 24 
hours in duration or for normal management procedures (i.e. chemotherapy).  
 
Laboratory findings DO NOT need to be reported as AEs in the following cases:  
• Laboratory parameters already beyond the reference range at s creening.  
• Abnormal laboratory parameters caused by [CONTACT_254844] (eg, in vitro hemolysis) and flagged as such by [CONTACT_345613].  
• An abnormal laboratory value that cannot be confirmed after r epeat analysis, 
preferably in the same laboratory.  
Amendment 2.0  
   
10.3 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE):   
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death – If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.  
• A life -threatening adverse event – The term “life threatening” refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk for death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345602] 24 hours - Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345603].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is medically significant - Important medical events that may not result in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
10.4 Causality  
The investigator will assess the relationship of an adverse event to the treatment 
intervention.  If possible, the investigator should distinguish the relationship between the 
event and (a) the clinical course of ARDS and (b) the investigational interventi on.   
Causality will be defined as follows:   
Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.  
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
Unlikely – The AE is doubtfull y related to the study treatment.  
Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment/intervention.  
 
10.5 Expectedness  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if those adverse events are described in 
the approved Package Insert (Label) , the clinical protocol or informed consent 
document .  
 
Unexpected serious adverse events are defined as any experience that has not been 
described in the package insert, protocol, or the informed consent document.  Expedited reporting is required for serious adverse events that are unexpected.  
 
10.6 Additional Protocol -Defined Serious Adverse Events  
• Bleeding / Hemorrhage: The development of a bleeding diathesis that in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_345604]-threatening, including (but 
not limited to) pulmonary hemorrhage, CNS bleed / hemorrhage, gastro- intestinal 
hemorrhage (frank hematochezia or hematemesis), genito- urinary bleeding (gross 
Amendment 2.0  
 hematuria), or uncontrolled epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] / oral mucosal bleeding  as defined in section 
6.4. 
• Acute Renal  Dysfunction : Abnormal kidney function requiring dialysis (including 
hemofiltration) in patients who did not require this procedure prior to study entry, 
or a rise in serum creatinine of greater than 3 times baseline for over 48 hours. 
• Deterioration of Respi[INVESTIGATOR_58260]:  Impairment of respi[INVESTIGATOR_345605] (HFOV) or 
ECMO , if not present at study entry .  This excludes intubation for re -operation or 
temporary intubation for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.   
• Multi -System Organ Failure: The development of potentially reversible 
physiological derangement involving 2 or more organ systems not involved in the 
ARDS, provided this organ dysfunction was not present at the time of  study entry.  
 
10.7 Reporting  of Unanticipated Problems :  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) regardless of causality to study drug, will be reported 
to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_429170] also be reported within 24 hours of receipt of the information by [CONTACT_093].  
All SAEs will be reported to the IRB per current institutional standards. In this trial, serious, unexpected adverse events believed to be definitely, probably or possibly related to the study treatment will be reported to the Food  and Drug Administration via the MedWatch 
3500A. The Michigan IND/IDE Assistance Program (MIAP) will assist the Sponsor in submitting SAEs to the FDA that meet the reporting requirements in [ADDRESS_429171] treatment 
as a result of safety related events during the study will also be reported immediately by 
[CONTACT_6968] ( [EMAIL_6689]
) to Jazz Pharmaceuticals, and in any event no later 
than 1 business day following Institution’s or Investigator’s receipt of notice of such occurrence, in full compliance with Applicable Law governing protection of personal 
data.   The Institution and/or study investigators shall provide a copy of all Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) reports to Jazz Pharmaceuticals by [CONTACT_6968] 
(
[EMAIL_6690] ) within five (5) business days of a DSMB meeting. As 
between the parties, the Institution  is responsible for complying with all the relevant 
Governmental Authority’s reporting requirements for the Study that are applicable to the Sponsor of a clinical trial.   The obligations set forth in this paragraph will continue until the 
later of (a) the expi[INVESTIGATOR_241726]; or (b) [ADDRESS_429172] subjects of others at increased risk of harm, but not 
harm occurs.  
Upon becoming aware of any incident, experience, or outcome (not relaed to an adverse 
event) that may represent an unanticipated problem, the investigator should assess 
whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem. The 
Amendment 2.0  
 incident, experience or outcomes is considered unanticipated if it meets  all of the following 
criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency);  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized.  
If the investigator determines that the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem, the investigator must report to the IRB according to the local IRB 
policies.  
11.0 DATA SAFETY MONITORING:  
 
Protocol Monitoring Committee:  A protocol monitoring committee consisting of the 
principal investigator s, one or more co -investigators, study coordinator, and data manager 
will meet monthly  during the conduct of the study to discuss expected and unexpected 
adverse events, safety concerns, adherence to protocol therapy, study enrollment, and 
any potential protocol amendments that may be required. Recommendations for study 
continuation, amendments, suspension and/or study termination will be made at each of 
the monthly protocol monitor meetings and formally submitted to an independent  Data 
Safety Monitoring Board.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) : Membership shall consist of two external (non-
Michigan Medicine) and two internal ( Michigan Medicine) physicians . The DSMB will be 
an independent body, with none of the DSMB members serving as study co -investigators . 
The DSMB will meet quarterly to review the conduct of the study, including review of all 
monthly reports submitted from th e protocol monitoring committee . More frequent DSMB 
meetings may be required, pending any issues raised in the monthly reports from the 
protocol monitoring committee. I n addition, the DSMB will review the study after the first [ADDRESS_429173] been met, and if the study enrollment should be terminated or 
allowed to continue. Enrollment will be held once  the 6th patient  has completed study drug 
therapy , to allow the DSMB to make this determination. Reports from the DSMB meetings 
will be furnished to IRBMED in accordance with Michigan Medicine policies.   
12.0 ADDITIONAL CLINICAL MONITORING PROCEDURES  
To further assure adequate protection of the rights of human subjects, this study will also 
be monitored by [CONTACT_345614] 
(MICHR). Routine monitoring will be scheduled at appropriate intervals, with more 
frequent  visits occurring at the beginning of the study. A site initiation visit will take place, 
followed by [CONTACT_345615]. Additional visits can be scheduled at the request of the Sponsor -Investigator.  
 
The established monitoring plan will ensure the quality and integrity of the data throughout 
the study conduct to verify adherence to the protocol, completeness and accuracy of study data and samples collected, dispensing and inventory of the drug , and compliance with 
regulations.  During the time of CO VID-19 pandemic, monitoring will be conducted 
remotely . 
Amendment 2.0

Amendment 2.0  
 16.0 APPENDIX 2:  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
Consenting SARS- CoV2 positive patients may present special challenges. In order to reduce 
possibilities for viral transmission, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and comply 
with the FDA’s 2020 guidance for obtaining consent during the SARS -CoV2 pandemic, the 
following IRBMED guidance ( v.4.17.20) will be used to obtain informed consent: 
https://research.medicine.umich.edu/announcements/novel -coronavirus -covid -19-irbmed- news -
and-updates  .  
Per IRBMED recommended guidelines, one of four options are to be utilized, depending upon the patient’s clinical status:  
Option #1: Patient Electronic Signature   
[CONTACT_345631] (web App).  
 
Option #2: Wet Ink (Paper Signature):  
Patient is able to physically sign a paper informed consent, but are unable to sign electronically.   
 Option #3. Use of Patient / Witness proxy  
Patient is able to give informed consent, but is unable to sign the consent form  (either electronic 
or paper) .  
 
Option #4:  Use of Legal authorized representative (LAR).  
Patient is unable to give informed consent (i.e. patient sedated on mechanical ventilation),  
 
Study teams must work with clinical care teams on the COVID unit to assess the following 
options and select the method most appropriate option for each individual patient. These 
methods may also be applicable in outpatient settings that include COVID -19 patients.  
  
Option 1:  Patient Electronic Signature. This option only applies to patients who are medically 
competent for decision making and can sign an electronic consent. The option will make use of 
an electronic signature [CONTACT_345632]  (web App), with the following criteria:   
 a) The patient must have access to email via a smartphone or computer to view the informed 
consent documents and apply their electronic signature. Due to current infection control procedures, the patient’s device must be used, as one will not be provided by [CONTACT_195780].  
 
b) A member of the patient’s clinical care team will first provide the patient with a paper copy of 
the unsigned consent document and any accompanying explanatory coversheet prior  to the cal l 
from the study team. The clinical team is NOT  expected to review the paper copy of the informed 
consent with the patient. It is the duty of the study team to review the informed consent with 
the patient.  The clinical care team is ONLY expected to provide the patient with the paper copy.  
The paper copy will be disposed of at an appropriate time, according to infection control standards.  
 c) A member of the study team will call and instruct the patient to download the SignNow E -
signature [CONTACT_345633], using the site www.signnow.com  . 
SignNow is a 
cloud- based provider of electronic signature [CONTACT_79152]. The company's Software- as-a-Service 
platform enables individuals to sign, and manage documents f rom any computer or smart -phone 
device. The e -signature [CONTACT_345634], iPad, and Android devices, and 
allows individuals to upload documents from their smartphone's e- mail and tap to insert their 
signature.  
Amendment 2.0  
  
d) A member of the study team will subsequently conduct the discussion with the patient by [CONTACT_345617]’s smartphone or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -room telephone. A 3rd-party, impartial witness must be 
available on the call. This witness should not be a study investigator or study team  member. A [ADDRESS_429179] phone call with thus be established for the consent process, including a study investigator, 
witness and the patient.  
 
d) After the patient’s questions have been answered by [CONTACT_345618], the patient will utilize SignNow on their electronic device to complete the signature 
[CONTACT_41705]. The witness should be present on the call to attest that the consent has been reviewed, 
that the patient’s questions were answered and that an electronic signature [CONTACT_345635].  
 
e) The electronic copy of the signed document will be placed into the electronic health record 
(MiChart)  and the study’s research records. The study team will assure that the patient receives 
a signed electronic copy via SignNow.  
 Option #2: Wet Ink (Paper Signature): This options will apply to patients without an electronic 
device, or for  patients who are unable to sign electronically.  It is anticipated that not all patients 
will possess an electronic device such as a smartphone or computer to complete the electronic 
SignNow process. Some patients possessing a device may not feel well enough to perform 
necessary electronic functions to complete the tasks. These patients may still be able to sign a 
paper copy of the informed consent  document.   
 
Wet Ink Signature [CONTACT_345636]:  
a) The clinical care team will provide an unsigned consent form (with any applicable explanatory 
coversheet) and pen to the patient. In order to meet infection control standards, the paper 
documents and pen must not leave the patient’s room.  
 
b) A member of the study team (study investigator) calls the patient’s mobile phone or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -
room telephone and arranges a three- way call or video conference with the patient, an impartial 
witness, and if desired and feasible, additional family or friends as requested by [CONTACT_102].  
 The impartial witness cannot be the same person conducting the informed consent discussion. An individual who also happens to be a legal authorized representative (LAR) may be considered 
the impartial witness in this process, but in their role as a witness they are only witnessing the 
patient’s agreement to participate in the research study and are not signing on behalf of the 
patient.  
 
c)  At the start of the teleconference, all participants on the call or video conference should identify 
themselves. The study team member (investigator) reviews the informed consent document with 
the patient and responds to any questions from the patient.  
 e) The witness confirms that the patient’s questions have been answered.  
 f) The study team member confirms that the patient is willing to: 1) participate in the trial and 2) sign the informed consent document while the witness is either present (if the LAR) or listening 
on the phone.  
g) The patient provides verbal confirmation that they: 1) would like to participate in the trial and 2) that they have signed and dated the informed consent document that is in their possession.  
 
Amendment 2.0  
 h) If the signed informed consent document cannot be collected from the patient’s location and 
included in the study records, FDA considers the following options as acceptable documentation 
that the patient signed the informed consent document:  
 • Attestations by [CONTACT_345619], and by [CONTACT_345620]. 
The Study Team and Witness Attestation Form via SignNow should be completed. Another 
acceptable option is to take a photograph of the informed consent document with attestation by 
[CONTACT_345621] a photograph of the informed consent document signed by [CONTACT_102].  
 
i) The following materials should be entered into MiChart and the research study’s source 
documentation:  
● A copy of the full informed consent document signed by [CONTACT_345622] a photograph of the patient signature (if any) OR  
● A copy of the full informed consent and the  Study Team and Witness Attestation 
Form prepared via SignNow, AND  
● A notation by [CONTACT_345623] (e.g., telephone) and how it was confirmed that the patient signed the consent form (i.e., either by [CONTACT_345624]). The note 
should include a statement of why the informed consent document signed by [CONTACT_345625] (e.g., due to contamination of the document by [CONTACT_345626]).  
 
j) A copy  of the informed consent document is available to the patient (now research participant) 
via a medical record request from MiChart.  
 
Option 3. Use of Patient / Witness proxy. Patients who are able to give informed consent, 
but are physically unable to sign the informed consent document (paper or electronic) .  
a) The clinical care team will provide an unsigned consent form (with any applicable explanatory 
coversheet) to the patient. The clinical team is NOT  expected to review the paper copy of the 
inform ed consent with the patient. In order to meet infection control standards, the paper 
document must not leave the patient’s room. An electronic copy of the document may also be 
sent to the patient (e.g., by [CONTACT_6968]).  
 b) A study team member will contact [CONTACT_345627]’s smartphone or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -
room telephone and arrange a three- way call or video conference with the patient, an impartial 
witness (see option #1), and if desired and feasible, additional family or friends as requested by [CONTACT_42036].  
 c) The impartial witness cannot be the same person conducting the informed consent discussion. 
An individual who also happens to be an LAR may be considered the impartial witness in this 
process, but in their role as a witness they are only witnessing the patient’s agreement to participate in the research study and are not signing on behalf of the patient.]  
 d) Before proceeding, all participants on the call or video conference should identify themselves. 
The study team member will review the informed consent document with the patient and respond 
to any questions.  
 
e) The impartial witness will confirm that the patient’s questions have been answered.  
Amendment 2.0  
 f) The patient provides verbal confirmation to the study team and the impartial witness that they  
would like to participate in the study.  
The study team and witness provide attestation to document that the patient confirmed their 
decision to participate in the study, either by [CONTACT_345628] (the witness should not sign as an LAR).  
g) The following materials should be placed into MiChart and the research source documentation, 
including a copy of the full informed consent document with investigator and witness signature, either on the consent or via SignNow, plus a notation by [CONTACT_345629], how questions were answered and that an impartial witness was present.  
h) A copy of the informed consent document must be made available to the patient via a medical 
record request from MiChart.  
Option 4. Use of Legal Authorized Representative (LAR) for patients who are unable to give 
informed consent . This situation involves patients who are incapable of decision making, 
including (for example) patients who are sedated, on mechanical ventilation. In such situations, 
their LAR may assume this responsibility.  
If the LAR possesses an electronic device capable of receiving email, then the same process as outlined in option 1 will be followed, in which the study investigator and LAR present,  and 
SignNow.com technology is used.  
If the LAR does not possess a suitable electronic device, then either a paper informed consent document will be given to the LAR (in- person), or mailed to the LAR.  The methodology followed 
in option 2 will apply, with the investigator and LAR speaking (in- person) or via telephone or similar 
audio device.  
The LAR must return the signed informed consent document to the study team. Options to return 
the consent document to the study team include:  
● Taking a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] t he signature [CONTACT_345637] a smartphone or camera, and sending the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_345608]  
● Scanning the signature [CONTACT_345638]  
● Faxing the si gnature page back to the study team  
 The following materials will be placed i n MiChart and the research study’s source 
documentation:  
● A copy of the full informed consent document and the image of the signature [CONTACT_94211] [CONTACT_345630] a signature [CONTACT_94211] [CONTACT_102730]. The 
individual obtaining consent may sign/date on the same image as the LAR or a print a 
clean version of the signature [CONTACT_3264]. The study team signature [CONTACT_345639]. AND  ● A notation by [CONTACT_345623] (e.g., telephone).  
 
A copy of the informed consent document will be made available to the patient (now research 
participant)/LAR via a medical record request from MiChart.  
  
Amendment 2.0  
 17.0 APPENDIX 3. International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Bleeding 
Scale 
ISTH Definitions of Bleeding: Major bleeding has been used as a primary endpoint fo r the 
evaluation of safety in clinical trials. The ISTH definitions of major bleeding in non- surgical and 
surgical patients are as follows:  
Major Bleeding in Non- Surgical Patient:  
1. Fatal Bleeding, and/or  
2. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, 
retroperitoneal, intra- articular, pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or 
3. Bleeding associated with a decline in hemoglobin level  of > 2.0 g/dl, leading to transfusion of 
two or more units of whole blood or red cells.  
Minor Bleeding:  
All non -major bleeds will be considered minor bleeds. Minor bleeds will be further divided into 
those that are clinically relevant and those that are not. 
Clinically Relevant Minor Bleed  
A clinically relevant minor bleed is an acute or subacute clinically overt bleed that does not meet 
the criteria for a major bleed but prompts a clinical response, in that it leads to at least one of 
the following:  
• A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46817], or  
• A physician guided medical or surgical treatment for bleeding, or  
• A change in antithrombotic therapy (including interruption or discontinuation of study drug).

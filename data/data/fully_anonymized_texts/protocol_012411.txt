Why is this  research being done?
The purpose  of this study is to test the effectiveness of dietary interventions that have the 
possibility to improve markers of gut health and improve general well-being. This study will allow 
healthcare professionals to learn how dietary interventions involving fasting can affect health.
Food is  increasingly recognized as important to treating and preventing disease. Juice fasting 
has quickly become one of the most popular self-prescribed dietary interventions in the United 
States. A wide variety of juice fasts are available in the popular market, the most popular 
variation is the three-day juice and vegetable fast. The purpose of this study is to assess the 
effects of a [ADDRESS_754380] on certain markers of age-related disease and bio-markers of 
longevity. In particular, this study will assess certain epi[INVESTIGATOR_27787]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_574736] (including diet) can change the way that genes are expressed (whether genes 
are active or inactive) without changing the genes themselves. This study will also look at the 
body’s microbiome- especially the bacteria that live in our gut- and how the body handles 
carbohydrates and sugar in the diet.

Page 2  of 9 HRP-592 /  v1.[ADDRESS_754381] and what will I need to do?
We expect  that you will be in this research study for [ADDRESS_754382] access to adequate food storage, such as a 
refrigerator.
While you  are in the study you will be required to do the following:
Dietary intervention:  For [ADDRESS_754383] dietary restrictions for the 3 days before and after this intervention.
Diet diary  recording: Includes documenting all consumed food and beverages during the periods 
of dietary restriction and dietary intervention (overall time commitment: 3.0 hours).
Biomarker collection:  At four points in the study a small amount of blood will be collected on 
campus by [CONTACT_574742] a finger prick along with measures of blood pressure, 
weight and waist circumference. You will be asked to self-collect saliva at home using a tube and 
a cheek swab, and stool using a wipe for collection four times (overall time commitment: 3.0 
hours).
Daily check-in: You  will be contact[CONTACT_574743] a check-in. During the 3 days of dietary intervention, you will also respond to a brief  
validated measurement survey online about how you are feeling. (overall time commitment: 0.5 
hour).
More detailed  information about the study procedures can be found under the section What 
happens if I say “Yes, I want to be in this research”?
Is there  any way being in this study could be bad for me?

Detailed Risks:  Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?
This research  may hurt you in the following ways:
Diet intervention : Fasting and juice cleanse diets over short periods are generally safe, but may 
cause some minor discomfort during the study period. For those on restricted intake diets, 
several minor adverse effects may occur and include constipation, headache, muscle cramps, 
diarrhea, general weakness, and rash. Most of these are short-lived, and are generally 
alleviated by [CONTACT_574749]. The restricted diet may 
lead to decreases in glucose levels.
Blood spot :  There is a small risk that the puncture associated with the blood spot may cause 
bruising or infection at the site of the needle insertion.
Weight, height  and waist circumference measurements: There is no physical risk involved in 
measuring weight, height, and waist circumference but there is a risk of embarrassment or

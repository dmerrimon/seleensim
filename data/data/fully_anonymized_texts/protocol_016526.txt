Protocol  
Brief Summary:  
This trial is taking place in Los Angeles, CA among patients from primary care practices within 
the UCLA Health System.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_450632] (ACIP) recommendation in 2010 
that all people above 6 months of age should receive an annual flu vaccine, vaccination rates 
remain low. The investigators plan to assess the effectiveness of text and portal reminder/recall 
messages with direct appointment scheduling (pre -appoi ntment, and no pre -appointment) 
encouraging influenza vaccinations sent to patient portal users , as well as the  effectiveness of 
tailored portal reminder/recall messages based on responses from pre -commitment prompt 
asking which time and which place they plan to receive their influenza vaccine using a 2 x 2 
nested factorial design.  
Methods and Procedures  
We propose  a three -arm randomized controlled trial, and a 2 x 2 nested factorial design within 
the intervention arms.  Patients are randomized within UCLA primary care practices  into 1) 
receiving text based R/R  messages with direct scheduling link, 2) portal -based R/R messages 
with direct scheduling link, or 3) the control group. Patients randomized to the intervention 
arms will receive reminders if they  are due for influenza vaccine.  
Nested within the portal reminder arm, we will have two additional components for  which 
patients  will be randomized separately: 1) A pre -commitment prompt, asking patients which 
time (September, October, November or December) and which place (UCLA, pharmacy, workplace or school, or other) they plan to get their Influenza vaccine with tailored monthly 
messages based on responses (pre -commitment message with tailored recall messages with 
direct scheduling  vs. s tandard (“fixed”) portal reminders with direct scheduling); 2) A pre -
appointment reminder encouraging patients to ask for their influenza vaccine at their upcoming appointment (pre -appointment reminder encouraging influenza vaccination vs. standard pre -
appointment reminder not mentioning influenza vaccination)  
Nested within the text message reminder arm, we will have one additional c omponent for 
which patients  will be randomized separately: 1) A pre -appointment reminder encouraging 
patients to ask for their influenza vaccine at their upcoming appointment (pre -appointment 
reminder encouraging influenza vaccination vs. standard pre -appo intment reminder not 
mentioning influenza vaccination) . 
Spacing of R/R messages: The pre- commitment prompt will be sent in September, direct 
appointment scheduling and no direct appointment scheduling reminders will be sent one time 
per month until record of vaccine receipt appears in the patient EHR in October, November, and December.  The pre -appointment reminders will be sent 2 -4 days in advance of scheduled 
visits.  
Languages: messages will be in English.   
Health Literacy: We will use plain language <7th  grade reading level per Flesch -Kincaid analysis.  
Eligibility : Our EHR will identify subjects who are eligible for either 1 or 2 influenza vaccinations 
based on ACIP algorithms (2 are recommended for children <[ADDRESS_574441] not had prior 
vaccination).  
Inclusion criteria  
Inclusion criteria will involve -- all UCLA primary care patients over [ADDRESS_574442] signed up for 
MyUCLAhealth (UCLA’s portal) and have used the porta l at least once within 12 months , from 
these patients, index patients per household will be randomly selected.  
a. Active patient: We selected >1 visit in 3y based on our prior studies and the literature to focus the intervention on active patients; practic es do not have a good mechanism to inactivate 
patients.  
b. Focusing on Portal Users: We can only send portal R/R messages to patients who have signed 
up for the portal. Since some patients sign up for the portal but never use it we will restrict our 
inclu sion criteria to patients who used the portal within 12m (75% of UCLA patients). This 
standard has been applied before. We will assess intervention effects for the included 
population, and also for the entire practice, since the impact of the intervention reflects the extent of portal penetration.  
Exclusion criteria  
Patients will be excluded if they are not a patient at one of the 67 primary care practices within 
UCLA’s Health System, and/or if they do not meet the above specified requirements for being 
an active patient or portal user.  
Main Outcomes and Measures  
Primary Measure s:  
1) Receipt of >1 influenza vaccine among index patients between 9 /1/2022 -4/1/2023 as 
documented in the EHR which is supplemented electronically by [CONTACT_450634] (e.g., pharmacies) and claims data.   
2) Receipt of >1 influenza vaccine among  pediatric  index patients between 9/1/2022 -
4/1/2023 as documented in the EHR which is supplemented electronically by [CONTACT_450635] (e.g., pharmacies) and claims data.   
Secondary Measures: Receipt of annual influenza vaccine between 9/1/2022 -4/1/2023 among 
all included patients in identified households.

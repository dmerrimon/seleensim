a Approximately 88  subjects were planned to enroll in 5 treatment arms (25  mg 
qd VX -561, 50 mg qd VX -561, 150 mg qd VX -561, 250 mg qd VX -561, and 
IVA 150 mg q12h) in a ratio of 1:2:2:2:1 under the original protocol. The 
25 mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg qd VX -561 treatment arms were discontinued;  
44 subjects had been enrolled and randomized to the 5 treatment arms at this 
point. The remaining subjects planned to enroll will be randomized 2:2:1 to 
3 treatment arms (250 mg qd VX -561, 150  mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg 
q12h).  
  
Study Rationale  This s tudy is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and PD effect (i.e., change 
in sweat chloride) for a range of VX -561 doses to support VX -561 dose selection 
for future studies, including studies of VX -561 in triple combination (TC) with 
CFTR correctors, su ch as VX -121 and TEZ.  
Subjects will be on stable IVA treatment at baseline and will be randomized to 
study drug treatment groups on Day 1 (VX -561 or IVA). Change in ppFEV 1 from 
IVA baseline is the primary endpoint. However, dose selection of VX -561 for 
future studies may consider the totality of data, including exposure -response 
analyses for efficacy (ppFEV 1) and PD (sweat chloride) endpoints.

Statistical Analyses  The following efficacy analyses will be conducted for ppFEV 1 and sweat chloride:  
The analysis of the absolute chan ge in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 12 will be 
based on a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (including 250 mg qd 
VX-561, 150 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg q12h treatment arms only). The 
primary results will be the within -group comparison for each VX -561 arm. The 
adjusted mean with a 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided. Between -group estimates 
of each VX -561 arm and IVA arm will also be provided.  
The analysis of the absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week  12 
will be conducted similarly to p pFEV 1 (including 250 mg qd VX -561, 150 mg qd 
VX-561, and IVA 150 mg q12h treatment arms only).  
A sequential approach will be used to perform the population PK/PD analyses for 
VX-561. Bayesian estimates of individual PK parameters from the final 
population  PK model will be used to simulate PK profiles for each subject, which 
will be used in exposure -response models to describe changes in sweat chloride 
and ppFEV1 from baseline.  
Safety analyses for all treatment arms (including the 25 mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg  
qd VX -561 treatment arms  that were discontinued ) will be conducted to support 
the dose selection. Descriptive analyses will be provided for the safety data 
comprising AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse 
oximetry; no statisti cal hypothesis testing will be performed. The PK results for 
VX-561, IVA, and relevant metabolites will be reported with descriptive statistics.  
Sample size  
Based on the initial study design that included 4 dose groups of VX -561 and an 
IVA 150 mg q12h dose  group,  assuming  a within -group SD of 7 percentage points 
and a 10% dropout rate at Week 12: a sample size of 22  subjects in the 50, 150, 
and 250 mg qd VX -561 arms will provide a 95% CI of ± 3.4 percentage points 
around the observed mean absolute change in  ppFEV1 from baseline at Week 12, 
based on 2 -sided, 1 -sample t statistics; a sample size of 11 subjects in the other 
arms will provide a 95% CI of ± 5.4 percentage points around the observed mean.   
Following discontinuation of the 25 mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg  qd VX -561 
treatment arms, the remaining subjects planned to enroll will be randomized in a 
2:2:1 ratio to the 3 current treatment arms with a sample size of approximately 
28 subjects for the 250 mg qd VX -561 treatment arm, approximately 28 subjects 
for th e 150 mg qd VX -561 treatment arm, and approximately 14 subjects for the 
IVA 150 mg q12h treatment arm. The total study sample size including 
discontinued arms and current arms is approximately maintained as planned 
(N = 88). Under the same assumption as th e original design (within -group SD of 
7 percentage points and 10% dropout rate at Week  12): a sample size of 
28 subjects in the 250  mg qd VX -561 and 150 mg qd VX -561 arms will provide a 
95% CI of ± 2.9 percentage points around the observed mean absolute ch ange in 
ppFEV1 from baseline at Week 12, based on 2 -sided, 1 -sample t statistics; a 
sample size of 14 subjects in the IVA 150 mg q12h arm will provide a 95% CI of 
± 4.4 percentage points around the observed mean.  
  
IDMC Reviews  An independent data monito ring committee (IDMC) will conduct safety reviews 
of study data as outlined in the IDMC charter. The planned IDMC reviews (with 
reference to number of subjects and duration of study) will be specified in the 
IDMC charter.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, chronic disease with serious morbidities and 
frequent premature mortality. At present, there is no cure. CF affects more than 
70,000  individuals worldwide.1 Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan dise ase.2, 3  
CF is caused by [CONTACT_460394]/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the 
CFTR  gene. The CFTR protein is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_663607], including 
the lungs, pancreas, and other gastrointestinal (GI) organs. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_663608], the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is 
approximately [ADDRESS_896107] been identified (336 to date), but many rare 
cases remain uncharacterized.[ADDRESS_896108] been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or 
function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with C F. Correctors facilitate 
the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. 
Potentiators increase the channel -open probability of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell 
surface to enhance ion transport. Depending on the CFTR  genotype of the patient, both 
approaches may be required to ameliorate lung disease in patients with CF.  
The therapeutic activity of CFTR correctors and potentiators has been established with products 
that were developed by [CONTACT_663623]: ivacaftor (IVA) 
monotherapy (Kalydeco®), lumacaftor (LUM) in combination with IVA (Orkambi®), and 
tezacaftor (TEZ) in combination with IVA ( Symdeko™, Symkevi®). Kalydeco, Orkambi, and 
Symdeko are approved to treat CF in patients w ith specific CFTR  genotypes. TEZ and LUM are 
first-generation CFTR correctors that improve the processing and trafficking of mutated CFTR 
protein, resulting in an increase in the quantity of protein at the cell surface. IVA increases the 
open -channel proba bility of the mutated CFTR protein that has been delivered to the cell surface, 
thereby [CONTACT_460397]. For the most common CF -causing mutation, F508del , 
the combined effect of either LUM and IVA or TEZ and IVA is increased quantity and  function 
of F508del -CFTR at the cell surface.  
VX-561 is a deuterated isotope of IVA with a specific pattern of 9  substituted deuteriums. In 
vitro data indicate similar potency of VX -561 in human bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells relative 
to IVA. Safety pha rmacology and nonclinical toxicology studies of VX -[ADDRESS_896109] shown that 
VX-561 had a reduced rate of clearance, increased exposure, greater plasma levels at 2 4 hours, 
and a longer half -life compared to IVA, thereby [CONTACT_663624] (refer to VX -561 
Investigator’s Brochure). In healthy subject studies to date, the safety profile of VX -561 is 
considered similar to IVA.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5.2 Study Rationale  
This study is be ing conducted to evaluate the efficacy and pharmacodynamic (PD) effect 
(i.e., change in sweat chloride) for a range of VX -561 doses to support VX -561 dose selection 
for future studies, including studies of VX -561 in triple combination (TC) with CFTR correc tors, 
such as VX -121 and TEZ. Subjects will be on stable IVA treatment at baseline and will be 
randomized to study drug treatment groups on Day 1 (VX -561 or IVA). Change in ppFEV 1 from 
IVA baseline is the primary endpoint. However, dose selection of VX -561 for future studies may 
consider the totality of data, including exposure -response analyses for efficacy (percent predicted 
forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second [ppFEV 1]) and PD (sweat chloride) endpoints.

150 mg qd VX -561, 250 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg  every 12 hours  [q12h ]) in a ratio of 1:2:2:2:1 under 
the original protocol. The 25  mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg qd VX -561 treatment arms were discontinued; 
44 subjects had been enrolled and randomized to the 5 treatment arms at this point. The remaining subjects 
planned to enroll will be randomized 2:2:1 to 3 treatment arms (250 mg qd VX -561, 150  mg qd VX -561, and 
IVA 150  mg q12h).  
9.1.1  Screening  
Screening Visit assessments are listed in Table  3-1. 
The Screening Period will occur within 28  days before administra tion of study drug. Screening 
assessments will be used to confirm that subjects meet eligibility criteria. The investigator (or an 
appropriate authorized designee at the study site) will obtain informed consent from each subject 
before any study procedures  takes place.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Screening assessments may be repeated once to establish study eligibility.  If repeat values of the 
individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed within the screening 
window, then the subject is eligible for the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rescreening

initiated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Extension of Screening Period Window  
The Screening Period window may b e extended by 2  weeks for the following reasons:  
 Repetition of the Screening assessments (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
 Unexpected operational or logistic delay s, or to meet the eligibility criteria  
 Repetition of spi[INVESTIGATOR_460365]  
9.1.[ADDRESS_896123] a Safety  Follow -up Visit 28  (± 7) days after the last dose of study drug. Safety 
Follow -up Visit assessments are listed in Table  3-1. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_896124] prematurely discontinues study treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) 
Visit should be scheduled as soon a s possible after the subject decides to terminate study 
treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, approximately 28 (±  7) days after their last dose of study drug. The 
assessments  performed at the Safety Follow -up Visit are listed in Table  3-1. 
Subjects who discontinue from study drug dosing for any reason (except withdrawal of consent) 
will h ave a final PK blood sample drawn as soon as possible after the decision to discontinue 
study drug is made. Additional safety assessments may also be performed at the discretion of the 
investigator, including possible consultation with a specialist consult ant. The Vertex medical 
monitor will be informed about these additional assessments, and any additional data collected 
(e.g.,  as the result of an outside consultation) will be considered part of the study record to 
provide the most complete safety profile of the study drug.  
If the ETT Visit occurs [ADDRESS_896125] to f ollow -up if both of the following occur:  
 The subject misses 2  consecutive study visits (telephone contact [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or clinic visit) and is 
subsequently unable to be contact[CONTACT_5143] (3  documented attempts by [CONTACT_155417] 2  weeks following the second m issed visit).  
 The subject does not respond within 2  weeks to a registered letter sent  after the 3  attempted 
telephone contacts.  
9.1.7  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
Safety and tolerability data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_82571] 
(IDMC) to ensure the safety of the subjects (Section  12.3.6 ). Procedural details of the IDMC’s 
structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be in the IDMC 
charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened.  
9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to tre atment. A 
randomization list will be produced by [CONTACT_14448] a qualified randomization vendor. 
The Vertex study biostatistician will review and approve the dummy randomization list. The 
final randomization list will be reviewed and approved by a designated unblinded biostatistician 
who is not a member of the study execution team (SET).  
Subjects will be assigned a unique subject number. Only subjects who have completed screening 
assessments and are eligible for participation in the study will be randomized to receive study 
drug during the Treatment Period. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_66763] 1 (<70 versus ≥70) 
determined during screening.  
Approximately 88  subjects were planned to enroll in 5 treatment arms (25  mg qd VX -561, 50 mg 
qd VX -561, 150 mg qd VX -561, 250 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg q12h) in a ratio of 
1:2:2:2:1 under the original protocol. The 25  mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg qd VX -561 treatment 
arms were discontinued; 44 subjects had been enrolled and randomized to the 5 treatment arms at 
this point. The remaining subjects planned to enroll will be randomized 2:2:1 to 3 treatment arms 
(250 mg qd VX -561, 150  mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg q12h).  
9.3 Rationale for Study Elements  
9.3.1  Study Design  
Subjects will continue their stable IVA treatment throug h screening, and then be randomized to 
study drug treatment groups on Day 1 (VX -561 or IVA). The efficacy and PD of VX -561 will be 
assessed after 12 weeks of randomized treatment. IVA (150  mg every 12 hours [q12h]) is 
included as a reference arm, but with unequal randomization to provide greater information on 
VX-[ADDRESS_896126] additional PK and PD data and enable a 
more thorough ev aluation of VX -561 exposure -response relationships.  
Following completion of the Washout Period, subjects will resume their prior therapy with 
commercial IVA.  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 21 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.3.2  Study Population  
The study will enroll subjects with CF with a gating mutation (see Section 8.1) to ensure a 
relatively homogenous population to evaluate the efficacy, PK, and PD of VX -[ADDRESS_896127] range of exposure for 
exposure -response  analyses. The original protocol  included 25 mg qd VX -561 and 50  mg qd 
VX-561 tr eatment arms; both treatment arms were discon tinued  in the current protocol   
. A VX -[ADDRESS_896128] as IVA on CFTR potentiation, and thus is also expected to result in a similar PD  (i.e.,

Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spi[INVESTIGATOR_155393]  11.4. 
9.6 Administration  
Study drug will be administered orally twice daily . Subjects will receive the same number of 
tablets each day to maintain the blind. Additional information is provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
Study drug will be administered with a fat -containing meal or snack, consistent with the 
recommendations for admini stration of Kalydeco12, according to the following guidelines:  
 It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or snack.  
 All study drug doses will be administered q12h to maintain the blind. All doses of study drug 
will be taken at approximately the same time each day. For example, the morning dose could 

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 23 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   be taken at 08:00 every morning and the evening dose could be taken at 20:00 every evening 
throughout the study.  
 The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administratio n, including whether food was 
taken with each dose, will be recorded for the 2  doses before PK sample collection and the 
dose received on the morning of PK sample collection.  
 On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug will be administered at the site 
after predose assessments have been completed. The meal or snack will be provided by [CONTACT_590584].  
 A subject’s morning dose can be delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 6 hours to accommodate predose 
assessments on clinic visit days.  
 For visits after the Day  1 Visit, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused study 
drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate.  
Missed Doses  
 If a subject misses a dose and recalls the missed dose within [ADDRESS_896135] 
should skip that dose and resume the normal schedule for the following dose.  
9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity  
If any unacceptable toxic ity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing (Section  9.1.5 ). 
No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed.  
9.8 Study Drug Interruption and  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_663610] a discontinuation of study drug or an interruption of 
study drug that lasts >[ADDRESS_896136] elevations of >3  × ULN, or total bilirubin 
>2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by [CONTACT_460406] [ADDRESS_896137] the tests repeat ed and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 
48 to 72 hours).  
Study drug administration must be interrupted  immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if 
any of the following criteria are met:  
 ALT or AST >8  × ULN  
 ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2  weeks  
 ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2  × ULN and/or clinical 
jaundice  
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.[ADDRESS_896138] values confirm the 
initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and no convincing alternative 
etiology (e.g.,  acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of 
whether transaminase levels have improved.  
All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases and/or bilirubin 
should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline.  
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation and/or increased bilirubin or clinical 
jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases or 
bilirubin return to baseline or are ≤2  × ULN, whichever is higher.  Regardless of the duration of 
interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study drug. Upon 
resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly until the Safety 
Follow -up Visit. If a protocol -defined transaminase or bilirubin elevation interruption threshold 
recurs with rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by [CONTACT_155421] 48  to 72  hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardles s 
of the presumed etiology . 
Individuals who develop adverse events (AEs) will be monitored closely; consideration should 
be given to the need for additional safety assessments and possible consultation (e.g.,  with a 
dermatologist, GI specialist, or other s pecialist consultant). Any additional data collected (e.g., as 
a result of an outside consultation) will be considered part of the study record to provide the most 
complete safety profile of the study drug.  
9.[ADDRESS_896139](s), request that the subject return for a Safety Follow -up Visit, if 
applicable (see Section  9.1.5 ), and follow  up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.  
Subjects who have been enrolled and whose screening CFTR genotype does not confirm study 
eligibility must be discontinued from the study, even if a previous CFTR genotype laboratory 
report was used to establish eligibility.  
If a subject withdraws consent for the study, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex 
may retain and continue using t he study data and samples after the study ends, and may use the 
samples and information in the development of the study compound, for other drugs and 
diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If a subject withdraws 
from th e study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will 
not be able to request the withdrawal of his/her information from the study data. A subject may

whether to unblind without first attempting to contact [CONTACT_577233]. 
If investigators deem it unnecessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact [CONTACT_351589]. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the 
medical monitor, they will use  their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the 
clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding.  
Contact [CONTACT_14452] (or appropriate backup) will be in a separate 
document.  
If a subject’s treatment assignment has be en unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent 
clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within [ADDRESS_896144]’s study file. 
Information a bout the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a 
secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with Vertex, the CRO, or any site 
personnel (other than the physician treating the subject).  In addition, the i nvestigator will 
consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE,

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 31 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated    Serum follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) for suspected postmenopausal female subjects 
only. Levels will be within the laboratories range for postmenopausal for subject s to be 
considered of non -childbearing potential.  
Pregnancy Testing (Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential):  
 Serum and urine β -hCG as described in Table  3-1. 
The pregnancy test at screening and Day  [ADDRESS_896154]. If 
pregnancy is confirmed, the procedures outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  will be followed.  
CFTR  Genotype:  CFTR  genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_14441] (Sections  8.1 and 9.9). 
Additional Evaluations:  Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. 
Local laboratories may be used at the discr etion of the local investigator for management of 
urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically 
significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_663627] a ware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the 
central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the investigator may base the 
assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value . 
11.5.[ADDRESS_896155] 
study visits. At other visits, symptom -directed PEs and symptom -directed vital signs assessments 
can be performed at the discretion of the investiga tor or healthcare provider . 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat (EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and 
neurological. Breast, anorectal, and ge nital examinations will be performed when medically 
indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as 
AEs.  
The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: head, neck, and 
thyroi d; EENT; cardiovascular system; respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133]; skin; and abdomen.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. The subject will be instructed to rest for at least [ADDRESS_896156] 
12-lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all 
ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:  
 The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG.  
 The test should be performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_663617]18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 32 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_168795]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study 
through the Safety Follow -up Visit will be recorded as AEs.   
See Section  8.2 for information about the ECG assessment for study eligibility.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled ECG, 2  additional ECGs will be performed 
approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains above the thres hold value (>60  msec from baseline or 
≥500  msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive 
ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. Further details 
pertaining to ECGs will be provid ed to sites in the ECG Manual.  
11.5.5  Contraception and Pregnancy  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Contraception  
Study participation requires compliance with the contraception guidelines outlined below.  
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
 True abstinence for the subject, w hen this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. True abstinence must 
be practiced from the Screening Visit through [ADDRESS_896157] dose of study drug.  
 If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). If a male subject is assumed to have 
complete bilateral absence of the vas deferens, infertility must be documented before t he first 
dose of study drug (e.g., examination of a semen specimen or by [CONTACT_155425]).  
 If the female is of non -childbearing potential. To be considered of non -childbearing potential, 
the female must meet a t least 1 of the following criteria:  
o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12  consecutive months and a serum FSH level 
within the laboratory’s reference range for postmenopausal females.  
o Documented hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy/salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophore ctomy.  
Note: All other females (including females with tubal ligations and females who do not have 
a documented bilateral oophorectomy) will be considered to be of childbearing potential.  
 Same sex relationships.  
For subjects for whom the contraception requ irement is not waived, study participation 
requires a commitment from the subject that at least 1 acceptable method  of contraception is 
used as a couple.  Acceptable methods of contraception are listed in Table 11-3.

Additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or requirements.  
a A female condom cannot be used with a male condom due to  risk of tearing.  
 
Additional notes:  
 Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to 
follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active with a 
partner of the opposite sex.  
 Male subjects must not donate sperm from signing consent, throughout the study, and for 
[ADDRESS_896162] dose of study drug.  
 Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant 
from signing consent through [ADDRESS_896163] dose of study drug or sperm from another source.  
 Male subjects whose female partner becomes pregnant through well -documented in vitro 
fertilization (d onated sperm) or banked sperm (collected before the subject received study 
drug), or is otherwise already pregnant before the male subject’s first dose of study drug, 
must be compliant with the contraception requirements. In this scenario, the male subject  and 
his female partner must commit to using a male condom (to ensure there is no exposure of 
the fetus to study drug) from signing consent through [ADDRESS_896164] dose of study 
drug.

Vertex medical monitor or authorized designee  on an individual basis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study 
treatment and for [ADDRESS_896166], becomes pregnant while participating in the 
study, the study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will 
1) notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24  hours of the site’s knowledge of the 
subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy, and 2) send the Pregnancy Information Collection Form to 
Vertex GPS.  
A subject (or their partner, if relevant) who becomes pregnant while on study will be followed 
until the end of the pregnancy only if on blinded treatment, or if they have been unblinded and 
have received active drug. The infant will be followed for 1  year after birth, provided informed 
consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow -up activities. 
Pregnancy itself is not an AE.  
12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses of safety,  efficacy, and clinical 
pharmacology results. Statistical analysis details on safety and efficacy will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP), clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the 
clinical pharmacology analysis plan ( CPAP), and population PK -PD analysis details will be 
provided in the Modeling and Simulation Plan, all of which will be finalized before clinical 
database lock.  
Final analyses will take place after all subjects have completed the study, all data have been 
entered in the clinical study database, and the database has been locked.  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
The primary objective is to evaluate efficacy of VX -561. The primary efficacy endpoint is the 
absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 12. Based on the initial study design that 
included 4 dose groups of VX -561 and an IVA 150 mg q12h dose group,  assuming a 
within -group SD of 7 percentage points and a 10% dropout rate at Week 12: a sample size of 
22 subjects in the 50, 150, and 250 mg qd VX -561 arms will p rovide a 95% CI of 
± 3.4 percentage points around the observed mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at 
Week 12, based on 2 -sided, 1 -sample t statistics; a sample size of 11 subjects in the other arms 
will provide a 95% CI of ± 5.4 percentage points  around the observed mean.   
Following discontinuation of the 25 mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg qd VX -561 treatment arms, the 
remaining subjects planned to enroll will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to the 3 current treatment 
arms with a sample size of approximately 28 subjects for the 250 mg qd VX -561 treatment arm, 
approximately 28 subjects for the 150 mg qd VX -561 treatment arm, and approximately 
14 subjects for the IVA 150 mg q12h treatment arm. The total  study sample size including 
discontinued arms and current arms is approximately maintained as planned (N = 88). Under the 
same assumption as the original design (within -group SD of 7 percentage points and 10% 
dropout rate at Week 12): a sample size of 28 subjects in the 250  mg qd VX -561 and 150 mg qd 

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 35 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   VX-561 arms will provide a 95% CI of ± 2.9 percentage points around the observed mean 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at Week 12, based on 2 -sided, 1 -sample t  statistics; a 
sample size of 14 subjects i n the IVA 150 mg q12h arm will provide a 95% CI 
of ± 4.4 percentage points around the observed mean.  
12.2 Analysis Sets  
The study will include the following analysis sets:  
 The All Subjects Set  is defined as all subjects who were randomized or received at least [ADDRESS_896167] data listings and

Biometrics document that specifies the programming rules, including the precision for derived 
variables . 
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value 
(max).  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
Baseline value , unless specified otherwise, will be defined as the most recent non -missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug. For ECG, 
baseline will be defined as the most recent pretreatment measurement (or the average of triplicate 
measurements, if the most recent pretreatment measurement is obtained in triplicate) before the 
first dose of study drug. Further details on baseline definition will be provided in SAP.  
Absolute change from baseline  will be ca lculated as Post-baseline  value  − Baseline value . 
Relative change from baseline  will be calculated and expressed in percentage as 
100%  × (Post -baseline value  − Baseline value)/Baseline value .

and baseline sweat chloride.  
Medical history will be summarized by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and Preferred 
Term (PT).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications used will be coded using the World Health Organization -Drug Dictionary 
(WHO -DD) and categorized as the following:  
Prior medication:  any medication tha t started before the date of the first dose of study drug, 
regardless of when the medication ended.  
Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received on or after the date of the 
first dose of study drug through the end of the TE Period.  
Post-treatment medication: medication continued or newly received after the TE Period.  
A given medication may be classified as a prior, concomitant medication, or post -treatment 
medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post -treatment; or prio r, 
concomitant, and post -treatment. If a medication has a missi ng or partially missing start/end date 
or time and if it cannot be determined whether it  was taken before the first dose of study drug, 
concomitantly during the TE Period, or after the TE Perio d, it will be considered in all 
[ADDRESS_896169] data listing.  
Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 37 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Details for imputing missing or partial start and/or stop dates of medication will be in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Study drug exposure will be summarized overall a nd by [CONTACT_3148], based on the Safety Set in 
terms of duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as: last dose date  – first dose 
date + 1 day, regardless of study drug interruption.  
Study drug compliance will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_155426], 
and will be calculated as: 100   [1 − (total number of days of study drug interruption)/(duration 
of study drug exposure in days)].  
In addition, percentage of tablets taken will also be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_155427], and will be calculated as: 100   [(total number of tablets dispensed)  – (total 
number of tablets returned)]/(total number of tablets planned to be taken per day   duration of 
study drug exposure in days).  
12.3.3  Efficacy and Pharmacodynam ic Analyses  
All efficacy and PD analyses described in this section will be based on the FAS, unless specified 
otherwise.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_663618] (25 mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg qd VX -561) will not 
be included in the mod el and will be summarized descriptively.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 12. The 
primary analysis (described below) is based on the within group mean of absolute change from 
baseline for 250 mg qd VX -561, 150 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg q12h treatment arms.  
The primary analysis will be based on a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
using restricted maximum likelihood. The model will include the absolute change from baseline 
in ppFEV 1 at Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 from the current treatment arms (250 mg 
qd VX -561, 150 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg q12h) as the dependent variable; treatment 
group, visit, and treatment by [CONTACT_663628]; with continuous baseline ppFEV 1 as 
covaria tes; and an unstructured covariance structure for the within -subject errors. If the model 
estimation does not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure will be used.  
The primary results obtained from the model will be the within -group treatment ef fect estimate at 
Week 12 for each treatment arm. The adjusted mean with a 2 -sided 95% CI will be presented in 
a table.  
In addition, the adjusted mean and 95% CI of the treatment effect difference between each 
VX-561 arm and the IVA arm obtained from the MM RM model will be provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamics: Sweat Chloride  
The secondary endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week  12 and 
will be analyzed similarly to ppFEV 1 for 250 mg qd VX -561, 150 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 
150 mg q12h trea tment arms. Adjusted means and 95% CIs of the average treatment effects at 
Week 12 will be obtained for within -group (for each arm) and between -group comparisons 
(between each VX -561 arm and the IVA arm). Details will be provided  in the SAP.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADM INISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any un toward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g.,  increase in its severity or 
frequ ency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinically Significant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin).  
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following:  
 Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  
 Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
 A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment res ults are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_896172]’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation  of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the following times:  
 For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g.,  screen failure, withdrawal of 
consent)  
 For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follo w-up Visit: through the Safety Follow -up Visit  
 For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow -up Visit, the earliest of  
o [ADDRESS_896173] dose of study d rug 
(see Section  9.1.5 ) 

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 42 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
[ADDRESS_896174]’s source documents. The following data will be documented for 
each AE:  
 Description of the event  
 Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
 Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
 Severity  
 Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
 Action taken  
 Outcome  
 Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the fol lowing website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/prot ocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
July 2018 ). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life -threatening.” The 
severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined 
according to the defi nitions in Table  13-1. 
Table  13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table  13-2. 

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.[ADDRESS_896175] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study  drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative et iology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-3.  
Table  13-[ADDRESS_896176] to an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no oppo rtunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow up)  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 44 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
 Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participat ion in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study 
drug)  
 Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445159]  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Important medical event  that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at ho me)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g.,  surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94250], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663621], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94252]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168789] (e.g.,  social hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.  
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or  action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.   

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 45 of 52

SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s)  will 
be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred 
to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the 
event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_168801](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to s tudy drug(s) will be assessed 
only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity 
assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved 
at the end of the study re porting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of 
regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and 
report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IECs, and

Clinical Study Protocol Addendum for Cystic Fibrosis, Addendum Version  2.0 Page 2 of 7 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Summary of Changes to Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Study Protocols  
Vertex is currently evaluating several CFTR modulators in  clinical studies for the treatment of 
cystic fibrosis (CF), a serious and life -threatening disease. In completed studies, treatment with 
these CFTR modulators has generally resulted in rapid, robust, clinically meaningful, and 
statistically significant im provements in clinical measures, and are generally safe and well 
tolerated. A dverse events (AEs) seen with these treatments are mostly consistent with common 
manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects.  
During this COVID -19 pandem ic, the safety of the subjects, investigators, and site personnel 
participating in these clinical studies is Vertex’s first priority, thus it is important to minimize 
any unnecessary risk to COVID -[ADDRESS_896190] 
to the integrity of the studies. Overall, the benefit -risk of these studies remains favorable.  
Vertex recommends that subjects and sites refer to local guidance regarding travel restrictions. 
There are no operational changes to the s tudy protocols for subjects who can travel to the study 
sites for their visits. However, to ensure continued safety of subjects who cannot  travel to the 
study sites for their visits (for any reason due to COVID -19), specific alternative measures are 
being implemented to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID -19 (see table below). As the 
COVID -19 pandemic evolves, Vertex will continue to assess the need for additional actions to 
ensure the safety of all involved in these clinical studies.  
Addendum Version 2. 0 summarizes additional measures taken for these ongoing CF clinical 
studies (see table below) to ensure continued safety . In addition,  administrative changes were 
made to provide clarifications  (e.g.,  changed Addendum  1 to Addendum Version  1.0) and to  
provide examples of qualified personnel (e.g.,  personnel from site or qualified health care 
agency) who may conduct s afety assessments, as indicated per protocol, during in -home visits.

• vital signs  
• pulse oximetry  
• height/length/stature  
• weight  
• physical examination  
(complete or abbre viated)  
• pregnancy test  
(serum or urine)  • urinalysis  
• blood draws for safety test panels 
(chemistry, LFT panel, lipid panel, 
hematology, coagulation).  
Blood and/or urine samples for safety assessments are analyzed as indicated per protocol for 
subjects who  have in -home visits.

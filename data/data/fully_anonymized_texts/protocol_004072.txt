1 Research Summary 
Purpose of the S tudy : 
We aim to study the ocular levels of alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone in the 
aqueous humor of patients with severe geographic atrophy. As there currently are no 
therapeutic options for these patients, further  research into potential therapeutic 
targets such as α-MSH, is of utmost importance.  
Background & Significance : 
Macular degeneration is a disease of the retina affecting the elderly. There are two 
forms of macular degeneration: dry and wet macular degeneration. Wet macular 
degeneration may be treated wit h anti -vascular endothelial growth factor (anti -VEGF) 
injections. Dry macular degeneration is slowly progressive and in its most advanced 
form causes severe atrophy and vision loss. There is currently no treatment for dry 
macular degeneration.  
The melanoc ortin system encompasses multiple peptides including α -, β-, γ-melanocyte 
stimulating hormone (MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). There are ﬁve 
MC receptors (MCR1 -5) that are expressed in a multitude of cells and tissues. Alpha 
melanocyte stimula ting hormone is widely expressed in the tissues such as the 
hypothalamus, skin and retina. 1 
There are several known effects of α -MSH including suppressing pro -inflammatory 
signals, promoting production of anti -inflammatory cytokines, inducing suppressor 
antigen presenti ng cells, inducing activation of regulatory T cells, and regulating the 
immunity in healthy eyes. 2–5 
Retina pi[INVESTIGATOR_530577] (RPE) cells have been shown to be a source of α -MSH. RPE cells 
in culture produce 2 ng of α -MSH in 24 hours. There is p ossible loss of α-MSH  in eyes 
with autoimmune disease or damaged retinas . Alpha MSH  may increase RPE and 
photoreceptor cell survival. Both RPE and photoreceptors expres s melanocortin 
receptors through which alpha MSH promotes cell survival.6 In an experimental  rat 
model for example w hen α -MSH analog was  injected into the eyes of rats with retinal 
dystrophy photoreceptor rescue was seen th rough to the hormone’s neurotrophic 
activity.[ADDRESS_689094] accurate analysis of α-MSH

Design & Procedures :  
 
If the subject decides to participate, the informed consent process will be completed . 
After completing the consent form, subjects will be asked to complet e a short mem ory 
test, the Montreal Cognitive A ssessment (MoCA), blind version  (attached to IRB 
submission) , to be administered by [CONTACT_530581] . An aqueous paracentes is 
will be then be performed as follows :  
The anterior chamber paracente sis will be performed using povidone iodine preparation 
and post -procedural topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163]. After informed consent is o btained the eye will 
be anesthe tized using topi[INVESTIGATOR_41459]. The lids will be cleaned with 10% povidone  
iodine and one drop of 5% povidone iodine will be applied to the ocular surface. A lid 
speculum will be placed to retract the eyelids. A  27-gauge needle will be placed through 
the clear cornea t o aspi[INVESTIGATOR_530578] 100  µl of aqueous humor. Following the 
procedure, p rophylactic topi[INVESTIGATOR_530579] 3 days.  
 
The patient will be re -examined for possible immediate complication such as bleeding, 
hypotony or corneal scratch 20 minutes after the procedure at the slit lamp.

8/13/[ADDRESS_689096]. Taylor has IRB approval for t he measurement of alpha MSH in 
ELISA assays at [LOCATION_011] University under approval number H -[ZIP_CODE] with original 
approval date 4/14/14. All of the samples sent to [CONTACT_29898]’s lab will be de -identified so 
he has no patient health information.  
 
A follow -up pho ne call will be made [ADDRESS_689097] surgeon (usually day 1, 
week 1 and month 1 after surgery).  
 
Selection of Subjects : 
 
The subject population will consist of up to 50 volunteers from the Duke Eye Center’s 
vitreoretinal clinic. All subjects will be [ADDRESS_689098] 
corrected visual acuity of 20/[ADDRESS_689099] corrected visual acuity of 20/[ADDRESS_689100] surgery.   Every reasonable attempt will be made to include subjects from all 
races.

8/13/[ADDRESS_689101] Recruitment  & Compensation : 
 
Subjects  with geographic atrophy  and control subjects  will be recruited by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Sharon 
Fekrat or [CONTACT_530586]  from their vitreoretinal clinics during standard -of-care visits 
at the Duke Eye Center.   Cont rols will also be recruited form [CONTACT_530587]’s patients 
that are having cataract surgery.  
 
Subjects will not be compensated for their participation in this study.  
 
Consent Process  – see Section [ADDRESS_689102]. Sharon Fekrat (Principal Investigator) or other IRB listed staff for this project will 
conduct the consent process prior to enrolling subjects. Each portion of the consent will 
be reviewed with the subject with ample time provided to  the subject for 
discussions/questions prior to enrolling onto the study. A copy of the consent will be 
given to the subject if they choose to participate.   
Patients with poo r vision will have the consent form read to them in the presence of an 
impartial w itness.   
 
Subject’s Capacity to Give Legally Effective Consent : 
 
Only subjects able to understand the informed consent process and with legal capacity 
to give consent will be included in the study.  
 
Study Interventions : 
 
There will be no study interventi ons apart from those described in #4 above.  
 
Risk/B enefit Assessment : 
 
While these patients will have significantly limited vision due to exceedingly advanced 
macular degeneration , the study poses certain risks  to the patient . There is a low but 
serious risk of inoculation of the eye with an infectious organism. The risk of 
endophthalmitis from aqueous paracentesis has not been published or studied, 
however is much lower than that of a vitreous tap or intravitreal injection,  which has a 
low rate of endopht halmitis of 0.05% or less.  The previously published studies of 
patients undergo ing AC paracentesis for uveitis have reported a 0% rate of serious 
infection such as endophthalmitis.10,11  
 
Other risks to consider include bleeding  due to pressure change or inadvertent damage 
to the ocular structures by [CONTACT_530582] . A corneal

complications such as hyphema (bleeding in the eye), leak from the needle track, or 
corneal scratch would be apparent during this time frame.   
 
As the eyes that will be chosen for the study will be pseudophakic there will be no risk of 
cataract  or trauma to the lens which is the most worried about complication o f an 
aqueous tap .  
 
While study subjects will not receive immediate direct benefit, the data  acquired may 
provide valuable information that will support the potential understanding and possible 
development of therapeutics in disease without current therape utic options .  
 
Potential loss of confidentiality is a  risk of any study however we will take every 
precaution to keep patient health information confidential.  
 
Costs to the Subject : 
 
There will be no financial costs to the subjects for study participatio n. However, the 
subject would remain responsible for the costs of their clinical care, which are 
independent of this study.  
 
Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations : 
 
At this stage, only quantitative analysis of alpha MSH levels will be performed.  
 
Data & Safety Monitoring :  
 
We do not anticipate that the risk for adverse events will be any higher than for other 
commonly performed aqueous paracentesis in the clinic setting. Specifically, we do not 
anticipate any adverse event as a result of study partic ipation in the study as every 
precaution will be taken to decrease the risk of potential infection. Additionally , by 
[CONTACT_530583] (pseudophakic) or no lens 
(aphakic), there is no risk for trauma to the lens  or induction of a cataract . The PI’s 
contact [CONTACT_530584] a late event occur. 
The investigator will review and sign off on all adverse events and problems as they 
occur and they will be reported to the IRB per Duke IRB  policies.

Chronic pain i s  defined a s  pain without apparent biological value that ha s  per s i s ted beyond the
normal ti ss ue healing time (u s ually ta k en to be 3 or 6 month s  1,2 ). Chronic pain i s  a wide s pread
public health i ss ue 3 , and it s  prevalence i s  enormou s . The weighted mean prevalence of chronic
pain in the general population ha s  bee n  e s timated by s ome at 35.5%, or [ADDRESS_230258] both phy s ical and mental functioning, thus
compromi s ing quality of life; it i s  al s o a ss ociated with a s tronomical co s t s . In addition to the
direct co s t s  of treating pain —including health care for diagno s i s  and treatment, drug s , thera p ies,
and other medical expen s e s —chronic pain re s ult s  in lo s t work time and reduced productivit y  5,[ADDRESS_230259] e s timate s  of the annual co s t of chronic pain in the United S tate s , including healthcare

One of the rea s on s  for the poor efficacy of the treatment option s  currently available for chronic
pain might be that the s e are primarily aimed at s uppre ss ing neuronal activity within nociceptive
pathway s  o f  the nervou s  s y s tem. However, it i s  now increa s ingly clear that neuron s  are far fr om
being the o n ly player s  that drive the establi s hment and/or maintenance of clinical pain
symptom s . Rather, evidence from animal s tudie s  now s ugge s t s  a central role of glial cell s  in the
nervou s  s ystem, including microglia 13,14 .
Microglia a r e a s ubpopulation of macr o phage s  that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_193828] s pon s e to a variety o f
pathological condition s  15 , including per s i s tent pain 16-23 . M icroglial activation ( M A) i s
characterized by a s tereotypic pattern of cellular re s pon s e s , including s pecific morphological
change s , proliferation, increa s ed or de-novo expre ss ion of cell s urface marker s  or receptor s,  and
migration to the s ite of injury [ADDRESS_230261] of a patient with chronic regi o nal
pain s yndrome in a po s tmortem s tudy 30 . F urthermore, an increa s e in the concentration of the
glial marke r  s -100β wa s  reported in the cerebro s pi[INVESTIGATOR_193829] s  with lumbar di s c
herniation and in the s erum of children with recurrent headache s  31,32 . F inally, a po s itron
emiss ion tomography ( P ET) s tudy ha s  revealed that human s ubject s  with neuropathic pain
secondary to peripheral nerve damage expre ss  increa s ed thalamic binding for [ 11 C](R)- P K11195
33, an in vivo marker of microglial cell activation 34,35 .
Recently, our group ha s  al s o s hown that patient s  with chronic low back pain (cLB P ) have
increa s ed b r ain level s  of the 18kDa tran s locator protein (T SP O), a marker of glial activatio n [ADDRESS_230262] T S PO level s . Together, the s e re s ult s  s ugge s t that human
chronic pain condition s  are likely to be a ss ociated with a glial reaction, both in the s pi[INVESTIGATOR_193830] r d, as
well a s  in the brain.
In the pre s ent s tudy, we propo s e to te s t a model built upon ob s ervation s  from our own human
data a s  well a s  from the animal literature, which de s cribe s  the temporal dynamic s , s patial extent,
somatotopic s pecificity, and clinical s i g nificance of glial activation in human s  with low back
pain. According to thi s  model, glial activation: (1) originate s  during the acute or s ubacute s tage
in the central nervou s  s y s tem s ite s  mo s t proximal to the back (i.e., s pi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]); (2) propagates
trans - s ynaptically 26,27 up to the brain, with increa s ing pain duration and (3) pre s ent s  a
somatotopic organization in the brain ( in the primary s omato s en s ory and motor cortice s ; S 1/M1 ) ,

which reflect s  the bodily di s tribution of patient s ’ pain s ymptom s . F inally, the model predicts that
(4) pharmacological glial inhibition re d uce s  pain and that (5) the pre s ence of glial activation in
the subacute s tage predict s  tran s ition to chronic pain.
In order to te s t thi s  model, we will s tudy patient s  with s ubacute (pain duration 1- 4 month s ) and
chronic (pain duration > 6 month s ) low back pain longitudinally. M o s t participant s  will be
studied before and after a treatment with minocycline or placebo. In animal model s  minocycline
is commonly u s ed a s  a glial inhibitor, including in preclinical model s  of pain [ADDRESS_230263] and ea s ily cro ss e s  the blood-brain barrier 37 ,
reaching ce r ebro s pi[INVESTIGATOR_193831] s  of around 25%- 30% of s erum concentration 38 . In humans
with s ubacute lumbar radiculopathy, minocycline wa s  s hown to induce a s mall but s tati s tically
significant r eduction in pain 39 , however it i s  unclear whether it reduce s  glial activation in
human s .
2. Specific Aim s  a nd  O b jectives

LBP
Hypothe s i s  1.1 . The cLB P  group will demon s trate higher P ET s ignal in the b r ain (thalamu s ,
S1/M 1 repre s entation of the lumbar sp ine), thu s  corroborating our previou s  ob s ervation s 36 in a
larger s am p le, a s  well a s  in the lower lumbar/upper s acral s pi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] s egment s  ( s ituated at the
T11-L1 vertebral level s ).
Hypothe s i s  1.2 . P atient s  with radicular cLB P  (i.e., pain in the back, s hooting down the leg below
the knee), b ut not tho s e with axial cLB P  (i.e., pain in the back only), will demon s trate an
additional P ET s ignal increa s e at the level of the S 1/ M 1 repre s entation of the leg, in the
paracentral lobule. Thi s  ob s ervation will provide evidence for s omatotopic organization of glial
activation in the brain of cLB P  patient s .
Aim 2. A ss e ss  tem p oral evol u tio n  of glial activatio n  i n  sub ac u te LBP
Hypothe s i s  2.1 . In the s LB P  group, the s pi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] P ET s ignal (but, unlike in the cLB P  group, not the
brain s ignal) will be higher than in healthy control s . Thi s  ob s ervation will provide evidence o f
spi[INVESTIGATOR_193832] s LB P , and indicate that chronicity of pain i s  needed for glial activation
to occur in the brain.

During s creening, potential participant s  will be fully informed of the purpo s e and activitie s
involved in the re s earch s tudy. Intere s ted s ubject s  will be s cheduled for an in-per s on vi s it whe r e
written informed con s ent will be immediately obtained, prior to initiating any of the s tudy
procedure s . One copy of the s igned co ns ent form will be given to the patient and one will be kept
in the s tudy file s  for documentation. N o time limit s  will be impo s ed on the informed con s ent
proce ss . P a r ticipant s  will be permitted to take a s  much time a s  they de s ire to engage in the
informed con s ent proce ss ; any and all of their que s tion s  will be an s wered. It i s  anticipated that
obtaining w ritten informed con s ent will take approximately 15-25 minute s , on average.
Comprehension of the con s ent information will be a ss e ss ed via s olicitation of an s wer s  to
question s  throughout the proce ss . If c o mprehen s ion appear s  to be limited, participant s  will be
actively queried to determine whether they need further explanation.
A phy s ician member of the s taff or a Nur s e P ractitioner will obtain informed con s ent, a s  in all
other protocol s  involving [ 11 C] P BR28 P ET/ M R s canning (e.g., 2011 P 002311).

Ther mal s timuli: We will al s o te s t for participant s ’ s en s itivity to cool/warm and painful s timuli.
Brief (1-15 s ) thermal s timuli will be delivered from a neutral ba s eline temperature (e.g., 32-
38°C) to different part of the body (back, leg, and/or arm) u s ing a computer-controlled s y s tem

Blood and saliva te s t s : a trained mem b er of the s tudy s taff will draw venou s  blood (up to 10 ml )
from all s u b ject s  con s idered for potential participation in a [ 11 C] P BR28 s can in order to have

unnece ss ary for the purpo s e of genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
While [ 11 C] P BR28 ha s  the advantage of binding to the T SP O protein with a higher ratio of
specific-to-non s pecific binding than [ 11 C](R) P K11195 49 , it al s o pre s ent s  a potential limitati o n, in

Of the s mall number of participant s  that we anticipate needing to s can without prior genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007],
only about 10% will be low affinity binder s . In addition, having s ome low affinity binder
participant s  may allow u s  to perform s ub analy s e s  that will determine whether excluding these
participant s  i s  the mo s t appropriate s trategy, rather than modeling genotype a s  a covariate in ou r

An additional 10 mL of venou s  blood will be collected and s tored for future inve s tigation s  on the

At the beginning of the s can s e ss ion, an intravenou s  catheter will be placed in the participa n t ’ s

7. Benefit s
It is unlikely that individual s ubject s  w ill benefit from taking part in thi s  s tudy. While thi s  s tudy
is powered to po ss ibly ob s erve a s tati s tically s ignificant reduction in pain due to minocycline, it
is unclear whether the effect will be clinically meaningful. However, finding s  from the s e s tudies
will help advance our under s tanding o f  the pathophy s iology of pain di s order s . In particular, this
project will a ss e ss  the role of microglia in the e s tabli s hment and/or maintenance of chronic pain.

As such, we envi s ion that in the future the information obtained from the propo s ed re s earch will

8. Ri s ks a nd  Di s comfort s
All s ubjects will undergo a telephone or email s creening to attempt to di s tingui s h potential
subject s  from tho s e not meeting eligibility criteria. Likely candidate s  will undergo a
characterization and training s e ss ion, w hich will include a clinical s creening procedure. Thi s
procedure will involve an s wering que s tion s  about s ubject s ’ medical hi s tory recording of medical
history review and an s wering que s tion s  about their medical s ituation including liver di s ea s e,
kidney di s ea s e, blood di s order s , heart di s ea s e, alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] u s e, high blood pre ss ure,
asthma and other re s pi[INVESTIGATOR_193843] s order s.
Subject s  will be in s tructed to complete the que s tionnaire s  to the be s t of their ability, but will
have the option to leave any que s tion(s) blank. In the unlikely event that evidence of phy s ical o r
psychological di s order i s  found, with the individual' s  permi ss ion, the information will be sh a r ed
with hi s  or h er primary care phy s ician who can direct care a s  needed.
The U. S . Food and Drug Admini s tration ( F DA) recently gave the fir s t regulatory clearance of  a

Thes e s afety parameter s  include s tatic magnetic field, time varying magnetic field s  (dB/dt),
specific absorption rate ( S AR), and acou s tic noi s e level s . S ubject s  will be informed about
minimal ri sks  of routine high magnetic field and non-ionizing R F  radiation involved in M R
imaging.
Subject s  will al s o be informed about the P ET procedure and the minor ri s k s  a ss ociated with
expo s ure to radiation. S ubject s  will al s o be informed about s mall s pace within the magnet and
noise s  made by s witching gradient s . Su bject s  will be informed that if they feel uncomfortable
with the s tu d y, they can choo s e to terminate the s tudy at any time. They will be informed that
their refu s al to participate in the s tudy or choo s ing to terminate it at s ome point will have no
effect on ca r e and treatment received b y them at M GH now or in future. The s ubject s  will be
informed that their per s onal informati o n will be protected a s  per the HI P AA guideline s .
An intravenou s  catheter will be placed for thi s  s tudy. The s ubject will feel a s light pi[INVESTIGATOR_29107],
similar to a bee s ting, and may feel s ome di s comfort and have s ome brui s ing or bleeding at the
site where the needle goe s  in. Depending on the length of time the catheter i s  in place, a bruise
may la s t for a day or s o. Rarely an infection may occur at thi s  s ite. If infection doe s  occur, it will
be treated. A l s o, an intra-arterial catheter will be placed by [CONTACT_193865] s the s ia

Rarely an i n fection may occur at thi s  s ite, and if an infection doe s  occur, it will be treated.
Inserting an arterial line (A-line) can h urt more than having a regular IV or having blood drawn
with a needle. We will place the A-line under local ane s the s ia (i.e., lidocaine), which may cause

the hand, which re s ulted in the need for s urgery. Thi s  i s  very rare and ha s  not been reported
when catheter s  have been in place for only a few hour s  for re s earch. A s ubject who will not pass
the modified Allen ’ s  te s t during the s c r eening vi s it will not be con s idered eligible for the
imaging vi s it, including A-line placement. Additionally, the in s ertion or removal of the A-line
might cau s e temporary dizzine ss , nausea or fainting. After the ane s the s iologi s t, ane s the s ia

 Background and Introduction  
 
Venous thromboembolism, which encompasses both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 
pulmonary embolism (PE), is a potentially devastating post -operative complication. VTE results 
in approximately 100,[ADDRESS_1168369] 
cancer and motor vehicle accidents combined1-3. PE results in 5- 10% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241900], making 
it one of the most common preventable causes of in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473]1,4. The rates of VTE after 
orthopaedic surgery are as high as 40- 60% without prophylactic measures4. Polytrauma, older 
age, obesity, prolonged operative time, and prolonged bed- rest are some factors that put surgical 
patients at higher risk. Enoxaparin chemoprophylaxis has been shown to result in a four -fold 
reduction in DVT rates in post -operative orthopaedic traum a5. 
The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and American Academy of Orthopedic 
Surgeons (AAOS) have issued guidelines for thromboprophylaxis following total knee 
arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, and hip fracture surgery (HFS)6,7. These guides lack specific 
recommendations for other high -risk injuries including pelvic, acetabular, or femur fractures. 
The Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) has published an expert panel consensus on 
prophylaxis in the orthopaedic trauma population, however8. Eve n with these guides though, the 
optimal strategy to prevent post -operative VTE remains unclear. Drug choice, drug dosing, 
duration of prophylaxis, and the degree of anti -coagulation are all still debated. The [ADDRESS_1168370] drug and duration6. The OTA and AAOS favor enoxaparin as 
drug of choice, but are equally non- specific on duration and make no recommendations for 
specific orthopaedic injuries7,8. 
Enoxaparin, a low -molecular -weight heparin (LMWH), produces an anticoagulant effect by 
[CONTACT_840929], thereby [CONTACT_840930]’s  inactivation of coagulation factor Xa 
(FXa), thus decreasing the likelihood of clot formation. Current recommended prophylactic 
dosing of enoxaparin is either 30mg twice daily (BID) or 40mg daily (QD). While not currently part of the standard of care, ste ady state peak and trough anti -Factor Xa (aFXa) levels can be 
used to monitor enoxaparin activity9,10. On twice daily dosing, a steady state peak range of 0.2 -
0.4 IU/mL and trough of > 0.1 IU/mL have been shown to maximize VTE risk reduction in non-
orthopa edic populations10-13. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_840923], VTE rates in post -operative orthopaedic trauma 
patients remain as high as 12.2%5. It is not known why some patients suffer from breakthrough 
VTE events despi[INVESTIGATOR_840924]. Cur rent prophylaxis guidelines do not adequately 
address these individuals6,7. The use of standardized enoxaparin dosing is has been challenged 
by a data from a prior study by [CONTACT_840931]. Body weight 
and the extent of thermal or surgical injury have been shown to correlate with anti -Xa levels in 
thermally injured, critically ill, and obese patients12-16

Page 3 of 8  IRB Approval 8/22/[ADDRESS_1168371] -operative orthopaedic trauma patients were 
enrolled and obtained appropriately timed peak aFXa levels. Fifty eight (53%) had initial peak 
aFXa levels within the goal range of 0.2 -0.4 IU/mL while 15 (19%) had initial aFXa trough 
within goal ran ge >0.1 IU/mL. Real -time dose adjustment was successful in achieving goal peak 
aFXa in and additional 14 of 20, resulting in 72 of 109 (66.1%) achieving goal steady -state peak 
aFXa levels. Ninety -eight patients (89.9%) were discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52123] s ome duration of 
outpatient enoxaparin, 25 (25.5%) of which were receiving doses that were inadequate based on aFXa level (aFXa <0.2 IU/mL).  
  
Eighty -eight patients have reached the [ADDRESS_1168372] to follow -up (no clinic visits and unreachable by [CONTACT_648]) leaving 90- day follow 
up data available for 77 patients (87.5%). There were no re -operative bleed events and there 
were two minor bleed events while on anticoagulation, including one patient with a heavy 
menses and one with a positive guiac but no identified GI bleed.  
  
Seven VTE events occurred, including 4 DVTs and 3 PEs in 5 patients (n 109, rate 4.6%). One 
DVT occurred in a patient who was within the goal peak aFXa range on initial blood draws (n 58, 1.7%). The remaining 6 VTE events occurred in 4 patients who had initial peak aFXa levels below goal range (n 47, 8.5%). Our data demonstrated that 43% of patients received inadequate 
prophylaxis in response to 30mg BID enoxaparin dosing and that a mod erate correlation (R
2 = 
0.46) exists between weight and peak aFXa in response to a fixed dose. Four patients were 
considered to be over anticoagulated (>0.4 IU/mL). 
  
This study would examine if a weight based enoxaparin protocol could elevate the number o f 
post-operative orthopaedic trauma patients receiving adequate chemoprophylaxsis. It aims to see 
if the orthopaedic trauma service can increase the number of patients that start on adequate 
prophylaxis and increase the number of patients that get discharged on appropriate doses. Two 
VTE events occurred while patients in the prior study were undergoing enoxaparin dose 
adjustment. These may have been avoided if the patients received an initial enoxaparin doses that 
were weight based rather than of standard d osing. Ultimately this study may aid in our 
understanding why breakthrough VTE events occur and hopefully become part of a means to 
reduce breakthrough occurrences.  
 
 
 
Purpose and Objectives  
 
Protocol Summary (ERICA)   IRB_00102526 
Page 4 of 8  IRB Approval 8/22/[ADDRESS_1168373] -operative venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in certain orthopaedic 
trauma patients to lower the risk of DVT and PE. 30mg twice daily (BID) or 40mg once daily 
(QD) of enoxaparin is commonly used as chemoprophyl axis and has shown efficacy in reducing 
VTE rates in post -operative patients. Based on steady state anti -Factor Xa (aFXa), a marker of 
enoxaparin activity, obese, critically ill, and thermally injured patients are often provided 
inadequate prophylaxis on t hese standard   enoxaparin doses9,10,12,13. In joint replacement and 
trauma populations, inadequate steady -state aFXa levels have been associated with an increase in 
DVT rates10,14,. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_840925], VTE rates remain as high as 12.2% in 
orthopaedic trauma. These events can represent a significant financial burden to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840926]. Existing data from our group and others suggest that inadequate enoxaparin dosing, quantified by [CONTACT_840932], represents  a plausible explanatory 
mechanism for some of these “breakthrough” VTE events.  
  
A previous study by [CONTACT_840933] 
(30mg BID) and steady state aFXa levels in orthopaedic trauma and found an association with inadequate aFXa levels and VTE events. A correlation was found between patient weight and their peak aFXa level. No association was found between aFXa and major bleed events. Based on these data, a weight -based protocol was adopted on for enoxaparin prophylaxis on the 
orthopaedic trauma service. The current study aims to examine how a weight -based dosing 
protocol alters the steady state aFXa in orthopaedic trauma patients as well as their risk for VTE and major bleed events.  
  
Aim 1: Evalua te peak steady -state aFXa levels in response to weight -based enoxaparin 
prophylaxis (0.4mg/kg twice daily) in orthopaedic trauma patients.  
Rationale: More than 12% of orthopaedic trauma patients experience breakthrough VTE events 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_840927]. Fixed dose enoxaparin prophylaxis has been shown to be inadequate in orthopaedic trauma surgery and several other surgical subspecialties. Prior data from this group showed that 53% of orthopaedic trauma patients were within goal peak aFXa range.  
Hypothesis: Initial peak steady -state aFXa levels will be within the accepted range (0.2 -0.4 
IU/mL) in 75% of patients on weight -based enoxaparin dosing in orthopaedic trauma patients, up 
from 53% on fixed 30mg BID dosing.  
  
Aim 2: Examine the response of aFXa levels to a real -time dose adjustment protocol. 
Rationale: Literature in several surgical subspecialties shows that dose adjustment can 
significantly increase the number of patients within goal the peak aFXa range. Data from this 
group sho wed that dose adjustment achieved an increase in the number of patient within range 
Protocol Summary (ERICA)   IRB_00102526 
Page 5 of 8  IRB Approval 8/22/2018 
 from 53% to 66%.  
Hypothesis 2: Protocol -driven enoxaparin dose adjustment in response to aFXa levels will 
increase the proportion of patients with appropriate aFXa peak levels to from 75% to 85%. 
  Aim 3: Examine rates of 90 -day VTE and clinically relevant bleeding events in orthopaedic 
trauma patients on weight -based enoxaparin prophylaxis. 
Rationale: This observational aim will allow us to better understand VTE and bleeding rates after 
orthopaedic trauma surgery. Events have been shown to be rare and we recognize that the proposed study is underpowered to rigorously examine alterations in VTE or bleed rates in response to the proposed dose adjustment protocol. 
Hypothesis 3:  Rates of post -operative VTE and re -operative bleeds will be < 2% in each group.

Study Procedures  
 
Recruitment/Participant Identification Process : 
Daily operative schedule will be reviewed for University of Utah orthopaedic trauma surgeons 
to identify post operative trauma  patients. Once identified, patients will be approached by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Daniel Jones  or the study clinical research coordinators (Kory Fleming, Andrea Gurule) to 
undergo the informed consent process.  
 
 
Informed Consent:  
Description of location(s) where consent will be obtained:  
University of Utah Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840928](es), including the timing of consent:  
Patients will be identified based on the daily surgery schedule and followed to see if they are 
started on enoxaparin post operatively at the discretion of the surgeon. Patients will undergo 
the informed consent process on post -operative day one or two while admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
No waiting p eriod between the consent process and obtaining consent is planned, unless 
requested by [CONTACT_102].  
 
Procedures:  
Patients will have enoxaparin initiated within 36  hours after  the surgical procedure.  The 
starting dose will be 0.4mg/kg. Blood draws will be a procedure performed in this study. After 
the third enoxaparin dose, patients will have peak and trough steady state anti -Factor Xa levels 
drawn.  These will occur at [ADDRESS_1168374] enoxaparin dose, 
respectively.   Patients with "in rang e" peak anti -Factor Xa levels (0.2 -0.4 IU/mL) will have no 
additional lab values drawn and will have no dose adjustment.  Patients with "out of range" anti-Factor Xa levels (<0.2  IUmL or >0.4 IU/mL) will have real time enoxaparin dose 
adjustment performed and will have repeat peak and trough steady state anti -Factor Xa levels 
drawn after the third dose. Most patients that require dose adjustment will only need it once. We anticipate a very small percentage of patients that will go through two or three rounds of dose adjustment. Dose adjustment for those under range will be a 10mg increase in their weight -based dose. Those over range will have a 10mg dose increase in their weight -based 
dose. Monitoring of aFXa levels will be discontinued when peak levels are in range, the surgeon discontinues enoxaparin prophylaxis, or the patient is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The enoxaparin doses used in this study are in accordance with the approved usages of enoxaparin and therefore do not require an IND.  
All patients will also receive sequential compression devices for the duration of their inpatient stay, as per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361].  
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_840934] 90 days after surgery to identify 
VTE or bleeding complications that were dia gnosed or managed at other institutions.

Procedures performed for research purposes only:   
The surgery is standard of care.   The decision to have surgery or not is part of the standard  
care and has nothing to do with the research process. 
Provision of post -operative enoxaparin is standard of care.   The decision (yes/no) to give 
enoxaparin by [CONTACT_840935].  
The non standard of care procedures for this study include:  
1. Blood draws for anti -Factor Xa levels after surgery (general ly 2-[ADDRESS_1168375] of real time enoxaparin dose adjustment 
will be examined by [CONTACT_840936]- range aFXa levels before and 
after dose adjustment.   Time series analysis will examine associat ions between initial in -range 
and out -of-range aFXa levels and downstream VTE and/or major bleeding events. 
Our projected recruitment results in inadequate power to examine VTE prevention or major 
bleeding events in response to enoxaparin dose escalation ( one of our aims).   This study will 
provide important preliminary data for weight -based dosing in orthopaedic trauma, which to our 
knowledge has not been done in orthopaedic surgery to date. We will collect data on 90 -day 
symptomatic VTE events, 90 -day majo r bleeding events (re -operative hematoma), and time to 
VTE or major bleeding event.  We will contact [CONTACT_112082] 90 days via telephone or certified mail to identify events that were diagnosed or managed at other institutions.   
  
Sample size calculation:   
Retention from our previous study in orthopaedic trauma  was 72%. 151 patients were enrolled, 
22 discharged prior to lab draws, 8 were changed from enoxaparin to an alternative blood thinner 
prior to lab draws, and 12 underwent blood draws but had unusable data as the draws were inappropriately timed (<3hrs or >5hrs after 3rd enoxaparin dose for steady -state peak xFXa 
level).  Of these remaining 109 patients, 53% had initial peak aFXa levels within our goal range 
of 0.2- 0.4IU/mL. Dose adjustment achieved adeq uate prophylaxis in an additional 13% of 
patients. Our hypothesis is that 75% of patients will be within range with  weight -based dosing. 
Using an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.9, we would need 107 patients to effectively power a similar  change for peak aFXa levels in the proposed study. With 28% over enrollment to allow 
for attrition, we would require n = 137.

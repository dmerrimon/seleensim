STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  We propose a two -stage design with co -primary endpoints of complete 
response (CR) and overall response (OR), testing a “both-and” null hypothesis against an “either- or” alternative hypothesis. Specifically, we 
posit that a CRR of 30% or ORR of 60% is achievable. Initially, 17 eligible patients will be followed for response. At this point, if fewer than 3 patients demonstrate CR (<18%) and fewer than 7 patients demonstrate OR (<41%), the trial will be stopped for futility. Otherwise, we will enroll an additional [ADDRESS_1197487] 7 patients (out of 33 total) demonstra te CR (21%) or at least 17 patients demonstrate OR 
(52%). When the true CRR and ORR are simultaneously no greater than 10% and 30%, respectively, this design will successfully conclude with probability at most 0.05 (one-sided type I error) and stop at the interim analysis with probability at least 0. 75.  When the true CRR is at least 30% 
or the true ORR is at least 60%, this design will successfully conclude with probability at least 0. 62 (power) and stop for futility at the interim analysis 
with probability at most 0.34. 
Multiple Grade 4+ adverse event (AE) stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_859317] [ADDRESS_1197488], enrollment will stop for any grade 4 
AE observed in  ≥7 (7/17=41%) patients. Second, enrollment will stop for 
grade 4 AE requiring discontinuation of treatment, as specified in the protocol, observed in  ≥3 (3/17=12%) of patients. Third, enrollment will stop if any Grade [ADDRESS_1197489] 17 subjects.  
Peripheral T -cell lymphoma response and progression will be assessed 
using the provisional Lugano lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy criteria (LYRIC) . Additional secondary endpoints include response 
by [CONTACT_165219], PFS, DCR, DOR, and TNT. Safety assessments will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs and documentation of physical examination findings and laboratory data. Type, incidence, 
severity, seriousness, and relatedness of adverse events will be recorded.

20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 9 of 84 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background: Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma  (PTCL) 
Approximately 10-15% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are derived from mature (i.e. post- thymic) T 
lymphocytes [ 1]. The heterogeneity of these lymphomas and poor understanding of their pathogenesis 
continue to impede their classification and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This is 
highlighted by [CONTACT_859348] T- cell lymphoma 
(PTCL) lacks any distinguishing characteristics and is designated by [CONTACT_265012] “PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS )” [1, 2]. While the development of combination 
immunochemotherapy (e.g. “R-CHOP”) has led to significant survival benefits in B- cell NHL, the 
PTCLs are associated with inferior responses to th erapy and overall survival [ 3]. In fact, the vast 
majority of PTCL patients will ultimately succumb to their disease, most within a few years of diagnosis [1, 2, 4]. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed if improved outcomes are to be achieved. The 
observation that PTCL incidence rates are increasing faster than almost any other subgroup of NHL further heightens this sense of urgency [ 5, 6]. 
 Anthracycline-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g. CHOP) remain the mainstay of therapy for PTCL, even though the survival benefit associated with this approach remains suboptimal[ 2, 7]. More intensive induction 
regimens and consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_20375]- cell 
transplantation are frequently employed strategies, but primary refractory disease and ear ly relapses are 
common. Three novel agents, belinostat, pralatrexate and romidepsin, were granted FDA approval for relapsed/refractory PTCL and are associated with overall response rates of approximately 26% [8], 
29%[9] and 25-38%[ 10, 11], respectivel y. A complete response rate of ~11% is observed in patients 
treated with belinostat or pralatrexate as single agents. Durable complete remissions are rarely achieved 
with these agents. Consequently, the outlook for PTCL patients with relapsed/refractory disease remains grim, and novel therapeutic strategies are needed [12, 13].  
 While preliminary results with checkpoint blockade (CPB) are encouraging, it is likely that novel 
combinatorial strategies will be required to improve outcomes in these patien ts following CPB [ 14]. 
 Brentuximab vedotin also received FDA approved for the treatment of relapse d/refractory anaplastic 
large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a subtype of PTCL, based on phase II, open-label study of 58 patients. The overall response rate in this study was 86% with a complete response rate of 57% with a median duration of 13.2 months [ 15]. Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in >10% of patients and included 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy[ 15].  Another phase II, open- label, 
multicenter study evaluated the response rate of Brentuximab vedotin in relapsed CD30+ non-Hodgkin lymphomas which included PTCL and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). The overall response rate in these cases was 41% with a complete response rate of 24% [16].  The duration of 
response is quite variable and short with the reported median duration of response of 7.6 months; however, the median duration of a complete response had not been reached at the time of the initial analysis[16].  Grade 3/[ADDRESS_1197494] common events [ 16]. Brentuximab is a promising 
treatment agent but the most significant limitation is the need for continued treatment which is limited by [CONTACT_859349]. Furthermore, the use of brentuximab within PTCL is limited to ALCL. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_859318], the outlook for PTCL patients with relapsed/refractory 
disease remains grim, and novel therapeutic strategies are needed.

20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 10 of 84 1.2 Background: Checkpoint blockade (CPB) in PTCL  
While durable remissions with conventional chemotherapy are rarely achieved in relapsed/refractory T-
cell NHL [12, 13, 17 ], durable remissions are achieved with immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including 
extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) and inter feron-α [18]. While largely anecdotal, these observations 
suggest that host immunity, when properly harnessed, can lead to durable responses in selected patients. These observations, coupled with high- level PD-L1 expression in a substantial minority of patients, 
further provide a strong rationale for CPB in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (C TCL) and PTCL. While few 
of these patients have been included in early phase clinical trials and further experience with CPB in CTCL/PTCL is needed, few durable responses have been observed to date. Twenty- three CTCL/PTCL 
patients were enrolled in a phase Ib study with nivolumab in relapsed/refractory hematologic 
malignancies [19]. Among heavily pretreated (61% had received ≥4 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) CTCL/PTCL 
patients enrolled in this study, no complete remissions and 4 partial remissions were observed, for an overall response rate of 17% [19]. While the median progression- free survival wa s 10 weeks for all 
patients, two responding CTCL patients achieved responses that were ongoing at 24+ and 50+ weeks. A single PTCL patient achieved a response that was ongoing at 18+ months. Preliminary data from an ongoing phase II study with pembrolizumab in relapsed/refractory mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary syndrome (SS) has been reported [20]. Among 24 patients enrolled, no complete remissions and eight 
partial remissions were observed, for an overall response rate (ORR) of 33%. Among these responses, four were in MF (44% ORR in MF) and four in Sezary syndrome (27% ORR in SS). Responses were observed in advanced-stage MF, including patients with tumor-stage disease (2/2, ORR 100%) and large-cell transformation (1/3, ORR 33%). While these preliminary results are encouraging, improved understanding of the genomic and immunologic landscapes may be needed to further optimize CPB in the T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. 
1.3 Background: Lymphoma -associated macrophages (LAM) in PTCL  
Gene expression by [CONTACT_56927]- associated macrophages (LAM) and their density within the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) explain the variable natural history associated with many non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In most cancers, tumor- associated macrophages  (TAM) promote tumorigenesis and are 
alternatively polarized. A growing body of evidence highlights the role of various subsets of myeloid-derived cells, including LAM, in tumorigenesis, and further supports the rationale for their therapeutic targeting in PTCL [ 21-26]. LAM are abundant constituents of the TME in PTCL, where they promote 
chemotherapy resistance[ 21, 24, 26]. Upon activation and differentiation, normal CD4
+ T cells produce 
cytokines that regulate LAM biology, including type 1 (IFN-γ) and type 2 (IL- 4, IL-13) cytokines, 
which lead to “classical” and “alternative” pathways of LAM activation and functional polarization, respectively. Cytokines produced by [CONTACT_248261] T cells similarly promote LAM recruitment/expansion within the TME [21], their functional (“alternative”) polarization [24], and PD-L1 expression [ 22]. For 
example, we have shown that IL-[ADDRESS_1197495] partially, PD -L1 (B7-H1) dependent. Collectively, this 
data suggests that depletion of LAM in the T- cell lymphomas may impair the growth and survival of 
malignant T cells and reverse immune suppression within the TME, potentially augmenting the efficacy of novel immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including checkpoint blockade, as demonstrated in other tumor models[ 27].  
We have shown that PD -L1 is expressed by [CONTACT_248261] T cells in 5-33% of PTCL, depending on the 
histologic subtype examined[ 22]. More commonly, PD-L1 is expressed by [CONTACT_308091]-derived cells, 
including LAM, within the TME in 22-73% of PTCL subtypes[ 22]. PD-L1 suppresses T- cell immunity 
both directly and indirectly, by [CONTACT_859350]3
+ regulatory T cells (Treg) [22]. The 
extent to which immunomodulatory strategies, including LAM depletion, may improve responses to 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium    Clinical Study Protocol  
    BTCRC-HEM16-[ADDRESS_1197496] been implicated in the recruitment and survival of LAM, 
colony-stimulating factor -1 (CSF-1, or M-CSF) is require d for normal macrophage homeostasis and 
viability. Mice lacking functional CSF-1 or nullizygous for CSF- 1 receptor (CSF -1R, c-fms, CD115) 
have a marked decrease in tissue resident macrophages. Therefore, inhibition of CSF- 1R has emerged as 
a rational therapeutic strategy in many solid tumors and hematologic malignancies[ 28-32]. We have 
demonstrated in pre- clinical in vitro studies that CSF -1R blockade prevents the generation of LAM in a 
variety of hematologic malignancies[ 33]. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ha ve also been utilized to 
deplete lymphoma-associated macrophages and inhibit lymphoma progression in preclinical models[ 30, 
34], and bolster response rates to checkpoint blockade[ 35].  
In addition to its role in regulating LAM, CSF-1R may directly promote the growth and survival of malignant T cells due to is aberrant expression by [CONTACT_248261] T cells and B cells in classical Hodgkin lymphoma ( cHL)[36]. We have observed that CSF-1R, the expression of which is normally confined to 
myeloid-lineage cells, is aberrantly expressed in various T-cell lymphomas (and cHL). CSF-1R 
expression was examined by [CONTACT_795250] a large cohort of PTCL specimens, and its expression (2-3+, >50% of PTCL cells) observed in 32% of PTCL, NOS , 69% of ALCL, and 40% of 
CTCL. Expression was rare in AITL. This lineage-inappropriate expression of CSF- 1R is likely 
explained by [CONTACT_859351][INVESTIGATOR_859319]- terminal repeat that drives 
transcription of an aberrant CSF-1R transcript[ 36]. CSF-1R signaling regulates cell growth, survival, 
and motility by [CONTACT_859352], including PI3K/AKT, ERK, and NF- κB. 
Therefore, CSF -1R may similarly promote the growth and survival of malignant T cells. To address that 
possibility, loss -of-function studies were performed in CSF -1R-expressing T -cell lymphoma cell lines 
that have been lentivirally transduced with an inducible non-targeting or CSF-1R-targeting shRNAs. We have shown that CSF-1R knockdown significantly inhibits cell growth and proliferation in these c ells 
(data not shown). When CSF-1R
+ PTCL cell lines were grown as xenografts in immunodeficient (NSG) 
mice, administration of PLX3397 (a CSF-1R kinase inhibitor) significantly impaired tumor growth compared with sham treated controls. Further studies to elucidate the signaling mechanism(s) exploited by [CONTACT_38247]-1R when expressed by [CONTACT_248261] T cells are ongoing, using genetic and pharmacologic approaches.  
The median overall survival of relapsed/refractory PTCL in patients that are not candidates for high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation is <6 months[ 12, 13]. The dismal outcomes 
observed in relapsed/refractory PTCL are explained, at least in part, by [CONTACT_62891]-rate of chemotherapy resistance and high proliferation rates observed. The aggressive behavior of these lymphomas poses a challenge for immunotherapeutic strategies, as disease progression may outpace the host anti-tumor immune response elicited by [CONTACT_859353], including checkpoint blockade, leading to cytokinetic failure. Therefore, therapeutic strategies, including CSF-1R inhibition, that may bolster anti-tumor immunity (upon LAM depletion) and slow the rate of disease progression (due to inhibition of CSF-1R’s cell-autonomous effects on malignant lymphocytes) are e xtremely attractive.

1.[ADDRESS_1197498] current pre- clinical and clinical  information on nivolumab, please refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB). IB version 16 was used in the development of this protocol.   Mechanism of Action Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS -936558 or MDX1106) is a human monoclonal antibody (HuMAb; 
immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets the programmed death- 1 (PD-1) cluster of 
differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD- 1 is a negativ e regulatory molecule 
expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes.1 Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, programmed death–ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen- specific T -cell 
responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-antigens.   Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was studied in subjects over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered as a single dose or as multiple doses of nivolumab every 2 or 3 weeks. The geometric mean (CV%) clearance (CL) was 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 8.0 L (30.4%), and geometric mean elimination half- life (t1/2) 
was 26.7 days (101%). Steady-state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 12 weeks when administered at 3 mg/kg Q2W, and systemic accumulation was approximately 3-fold. The exposure to nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every [ADDRESS_1197499]  on the CL of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), gender, race, 
baseline LDH, PD -L1. A PPK analysis suggested no difference in CL of nivolumab based on age, 
gender, race, solid tumor type, baseline tumor size, and hepatic impairment. Although E COG status, 
baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), albumin, body weight, and mild hepatic impairment had an effect on nivolumab CL, the effect was not clinically meaningful. PPK analysis suggest that nivolumab CL in subjects with cHL was approximately 32% lower relative to subjects with NSCLC; however, the lower CL in cHL subjects was not considered to be clinically relevant as nivolumab exposure was not a significant predictor for safety risks for these patients. When nivolumab is administered in combi nation with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  the CL of nivolumab was increased by 24%, whereas 
there was no effect on the clearance of  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Additionally, PPK and exposure response 
analyses have been performed to support use of 240 mg Q2W dosing in addition to the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen. A flat dose of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W was selected since it is identical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for subjects weighing 80 kg, the observed median body weight in nivolumab- treated cancer patients. 
Using a PPK model, the overall distributions of nivolumab exposures (Cavgss, Cminss, Cmaxss, and Cmin1) are  comparable after treatment with either 3 mg/kg or 240 mg nivolumab. The predicted 
range of nivolumab exposures (median and 90% prediction intervals) resulting from a 240 mg flat

 Safety  
The overall safety experience with nivolumab, as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 16,[ADDRESS_1197500] advanced combination under development is nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b, which is approved in subjects with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and being studied in multiple tumor types. Results to date 
suggest that the safety profile of nivolumab+ipi[INVESTIGATOR_859320]. The nature of the AEs is similar to that observed with either agent  used as monotherapy; however, both frequency and severity of most AEs are 
increased with the combination.   Across all studies conducted to date, drug- related AE s have included pulmonary toxicity, renal 
toxicity (including acute renal failure), endocrine abnormalities, GI toxicity, dermatologic toxicity 
(including rash), and hepatotoxicity. For nivolumab monotherapy and combination therapy, the majority of these A Es have been managed  successfully with supportive care and, in more severe 
cases, a combination of dose delay, permanent discontinuation, and/or use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed in the management guidelines provided in Appendix 17.1.  Summary of relevant clinical studies The PK, clinical activity, and safety of nivolumab have been assessed in approximately [ADDRESS_1197501] received ni volumab 
monotherapy in single- or multiple -dose Phase 1/2/3 studies or studies with nivolumab in 
combination with other therapeutics (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti-angiogenics, and targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]).   
 Rationale for starting dose The starting dose of nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) has been chosen based on previous phase I and II data regarding safety and efficacy of nivolumab. This is the FDA approved dosing in numerous other tumor types including cHL.  Metabolism and r oute(s) of elimination  
Nivolumab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody, which is eliminated by [CONTACT_859354]-HEM16-085 
20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 14 of 84 other antibodies, namely by [CONTACT_105]- specific catabolism (mainly by [CONTACT_859355])[37]. Steady -state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by [CONTACT_3450] 12 weeks 
when administered at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic accumulation was approximately 3.7-
fold. The exposure to nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every [ADDRESS_1197502] on the clearance 
of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), gender, race, b aseline LDH, PD -L1, solid tumor type, baseline 
tumor size, and hepatic impairment. Although ECOG status, baseline glomerular filtration rate  
(GFR), albumin, and body weight had an effect on nivolumab CL, the effect was not clinically meaningful. PPK analysis suggested that nivolumab CL in subjects with cHL was approximately 32% lower relative to subjects with NSCLC; however, the lower CL in cHL subjects was not considered to be clinically relevant as nivolumab exposure was not a significant predictor for sa fety risks for these 
patients.  
 Drug interactions Although monoclonal antibodies are not direct inhibitors/inducers of metabolizing enzymes, recent literature reports suggest that therapeutic proteins that are modulators of cytokines may indirectly affect expression of cytochrome (CYP) enzymes [38]. The indirect drug-drug interaction potential of 
nivolumab was assessed using systemic cytokine modulation data for cytokines known to modulate CYP enzymes, at single and multiple doses of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg Q3W from CA209009. There were no meaningful changes in cytokines known to have indirect effects on CYP enzymes across all dose levels of nivolumab (0.3, 2 and 10 mg/kg) during the course of treatment. This  lack of cytokine modulation 
suggests that nivolumab has no or low potential for modulating CYP enzymes, thereby [CONTACT_124439] a low risk of therapeutic protein-drug interaction. Nivolumab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody, which is eliminated by [CONTACT_537519], namely by [CONTACT_105]- specific catabolism 
(mainly by [CONTACT_859356]) [37]. These enzymes are not known to be 
inhibited or induced by [CONTACT_8422], and therefore it is unlikely that other drugs will have an impact on the PK of nivolumab.

Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  IB version 6 was used in the development of this protocol.  
 
Mechanism of Action Cabiralizumab ( BMS-986227) is a recombinant, humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to 
human CSF1R. Binding of BMS -986227 to CSF1R antagonizes binding of CSF1 and IL34, the 2 
ligands to CSF1R, thereby [CONTACT_754436]1R. CSF1R signaling plays a fundamental role 
in the differentiation, maintenance, and function of monocytic lineage cells including monocytes, macrophages, and osteoclasts[ 39]. Two ligands have been identified for CSF1R, CSF1 and IL34. These 
2 ligands share little amino acid homology, but both bind similar regions of the CSF1R with similar affinities (reviewed in  [40]). 
 The tumor microenvironment, composed of non- cancer cells and stroma, is recognized as a major factor 
influencing the growth of tumor cells. Tumor- associated macrophages (TAMs) are particularly abundant 
in the tumor microenvironment and are thought to play a key role in promoting tumor growth. 
Substantial evidence suggests that TAMs are polarized towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype and 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium    Clinical Study Protocol  
    BTCRC-HEM16-085 
20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 15 of 84 through the expression of cell surface T cell inhibitors and immunosuppressive soluble factors play a 
major role in inhibiting anti-tumor immune responses[ 41]. In the majority of tumors, TAMs are 
associated with a poor prognosis[ 42], making TAMs an attractive therapeutic target. Because CSF1 is a 
major survival factor for TAMs, targeting CSF1R through BMS -986227 should reduce tumor- associated 
macrophage-mediated immune suppression resulting in strengthening the anti-tumor response to immunotherapy. 
1.6.1 Cabiralizumab Clinical Summary  
The clinical summary of safety and efficacy is based on three clinical studies:  
1. Study FPA008-001 evaluated the safety of cabiralizumab as single or double ascending doses in 48 
healthy volunteers (36 received cabiralizumab and 12 received placebo). This study also evaluated the safety and efficacy of cabiralizumab administered as two or three doses, 14 days apart, in 18 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) subjects. This study has been completed. 
2. Study FPA008-002 is evaluating the safety and efficacy of cabiralizumab monotherapy for 6 months in approximately 40 subjects with pi[INVESTIGATOR_134364] (PVNS).  
3. Study FPA008-003 is evaluating the safety and efficacy of cabiralizumab as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in approxim ately 295 subjects with advanced cancers.  
Clinical Pharmacology Summary (Pharmacokinetics, Immunogenicity, and Pharmacodynamics)  The available PK, ADA, and nonclassical CD16+ monocyte status following cabiralizumab treatment with either monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab were characterized in three trials: FPA008 001, FPA008-002, and FPA008-003. The PK, ADA, and nonclassical CD16+ monocyte data from Study FPA008-003 are summarized below; data from Studies FPA008 001 and FPA008- 002 are presented i n 
the cabiralizumab IB. 
 The PK profile of cabiralizumab is characterized by [CONTACT_859357], with the latter likely mediated by [CONTACT_38220]1R on cells. As monocyte and macrophage cells are dependent on CSF1R for viability, these target -bearing cells are reduced in number following cabiralizumab 
treatment, resulting in a decrease of target -mediated clearance. Once target mediated clearance is 
saturated at high or repeat doses, cabiralizumab clearance is similar to other human IgG antibodies.  Study FPA008-003 – Advanced Cancer (Cabiralizumab Monotherapy) In Phase 1a, subjects with cancer received cabiralizumab at doses of 2, 4, and 6 mg/kg Q2W as monotherapy and 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg Q2W in combination with 3 mg/kg nivolumab Q2W. There were a total of 25 subjects (n = 16 for monotherapy and n = 9 for combination treatment) with PK data as of [ADDRESS_1197504] dose in cancer subjects at 2, 4, and 6 mg/kg as monotherapy or at 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab, Cmax increased dose proportionally, while AUC and Cmin increased more than dose proportionally, suggesting target- mediated clearance. Accumulation was observed for 
Cmax and Cmin with ≥ 2 mg/kg Q2W dosing. Exposures were similar at 4 mg/kg for cabiralizumab as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab (limited data).

20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 16 of 84 Assessment of nonclassical CD16+ monocytes in Study FPA008-003 has been evaluated in cohorts 
receiving 2, 4, or 6 mg/kg cabiralizumab monotherapy. In addition, assessment of nonclassical CD16+ monocytes has been evaluated in cohorts receiving a combination of 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab with 3 mg/kg nivolumab. In the 2 mg/kg monotherapy cohort, cabiralizumab reduced nonclassical CD16+ monocytes throughout the 2-week dosing interval in 2 of 3 subjects evaluated. In the 4 mg/kg monotherapy cohort, cabiralizumab reduced nonclassical CD16+ monocytes throughout the 2- week 
dosing interval in [ADDRESS_1197505] who is evaluable. In the 6 mg/kg monotherapy cohort of ca biralizumab, all 
subjects showed reduction of nonclassical CD16+ monocytes through the 2-week dosing interval. End-of-treatment follow -up data are pending.  
 In the cohort receiving the combination of cabiralizumab at 1 mg/kg plus nivolumab, nonclassical CD16+ monocytes were reduced at 72 hours, but reduction was not maintained through the dosing interval. Nonclassical CD16+ monocytes returned to baseline levels in one subject and increased above baseline levels in two subjects. In the cohort receiving the combination of cabiralizumab at 2 mg/kg plus nivolumab, nonclassical CD16+ monocytes were reduced within [ADDRESS_1197506] dose. However, in 2 of the 3 subjects dosed with 2 mg/kg, cabiralizumab in combination with nivolumab was insufficien t to 
reduce nonclassical CD16+ monocytes throughout the 2-week dosing interval. In the cohort receiving 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab plus nivolumab, nonclassical CD16+ monocytes were reduced below the detection limits of the assay in all 3 subjects. Insufficient end-of-treatment follow -up data are available at this 
time. 
 Based on a review of PK and PD, the recommended dose for this study has been chosen as 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab in combination with  [ADDRESS_1197507] been treated in Study FPA008-003; [ADDRESS_1197508] been treated in the Phases 1a 
and 1b dose-expansion combination cohorts.

This study is ongoing, but enrollment is completed. Preliminary 
safety data are described below.

20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 17 of 84 Treatment -related AEs were experienced by 17 of 24 (70.8%) subjects who received cabiralizumab 
monotherapy. The most commonly reported (≥ 25% of subjects) treatment -related AEs included AST 
increased (8 [33.3%] subjects), fatigue and periorbital oedema (7 [29.2%] su bjects each), and blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased (6 [25.0%] subjects). The incidence of the treatment -related AEs that 
occurred in > 10% of the subjects is listed in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-[ADDRESS_1197510] in Phase 1a monotherapy. 
 Serious Adverse Events  
Of the 24 subjects receiving cabiralizumab monotherapy, 8 (33.3%) subjects experienced at least 1 SAE. Treatment -related SAEs occurred in 2 of 24 (8.3%) subjects and included Grade 3 blood creatine 
phosphokinase increase (1 [4.2%] subject) and Grade 3 rash (1 [4.2%] subject).  Dose-limiting Toxicities  
Four DLTs were reported in the Phase 1a monotherapy arms of this study. One of the DLTs was a Grade 
[ADDRESS_1197511] increase occurred at 6 mg/kg cabiralizumab monotherapy, and the other [ADDRESS_1197512] increases occurred at 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab monotherapy. All DLTs resolved after discontinuation of study drug with no sequelae. These DLTs were all attributed to isolated increases in laboratory values ([ADDRESS_1197513] due to elevation of CK), which were expected with administration of FPA008 due to diminished clearance of ALT,  AST, CK, and LDH molecules from 
serum secondary to a reduced number of liver Kupffer cells.  Based on this information, the management 
algorithms for hepatic AEs and liver enzyme alterations have been subsequently amended to allow higher cutoffs for these laboratory values as described in sections 17.1.2 and 17.1.3. 
 Discontinuations  
A total of 3 of 24 (12.5%) subjects receiving cabiralizumab monotherapy discontinued study treatment due to a treatment -related AE, including Grade [ADDRESS_1197514] increased (2 [8.3%] subjects) and Grade 3 blood 
creatine phosphokinase inc reased (1 [4.2%] subject).   
Deaths 
A total of 14 of 24 (58.3%) subjects receiving cabiralizumab monotherapy died during the course of 
Phase 1a monotherapy. No subjects died due to an AE.  Conclusion Administration of cabiralizumab, as monotherapy, presents a tolerable safety profile. The most frequent AEs (AST and blood creatine phosphokinase increased) are aligned to the specific MOA of the molecule and can be managed by [CONTACT_859358].

In the Phase 1a combination therapy dose-escalation cohorts, 6 of 16 (37.5%) subjects experienced at 
least 1 SAE. Treatment -related SAE s occurred in 2 of 16 (12.5%) subjects and included Grade 5 
pneumonitis (1 [6.3%] subject) and Grade 3 colitis (1 [6.3%] subject).  Dose-limiting Toxicities  
No DLTs were reported in the Phase 1a dose-escalation combination therapy arm of this study.  Discontinuations  
In the Phase 1a combination therapy dose-escalation cohorts, 2 of 16 (12.5%) subjects discontinued study treatment due to a treatment -related AE and included Grade 4 pneumonitis (1 [6.3%] subject) and 
Grade 3 colitis (1 [6.3%] subject).  Deaths 
In the Phase 1a combination therapy dose-escalation cohorts, 10 of 16 (62.5%) subjects died. One of 16 (6.3%) subjects died due to a treatment-related AE of pneumonitis.  Conclusion The combination of cabiralizumab and nivolumab, as tested in Phase 1a combination therapy dose-escalation cohorts, presents a tolerable safety profile. The most frequent AEs (periorbital oedema, blood creatine phosphokinase, and AST increased) are aligned to the specific MOA of the molecule and, as described above, can be managed by [CONTACT_859358].

1.6.[ADDRESS_1197517] of anti-CSF1R antibodies on the Kupffer cell in the liver that results in a depletion of these cells. Depletion of Kupffer cells allows the enzymes, which are released following normally occurring liver cell turnover, to enter circulation (where they are measured by [CONTACT_859360]) rather than being absorbed by [CONTACT_737451]. Elevated liver enzymes, thus, represent a PD marker rather than a 
safety signal. The observed elevations were asymptomatic not permanent and not associated with clinical sequelae. Similar effects have been observed across other CSF1R targeted agents (see cabiralizumab IB for additional details). The data wi th cabiralizumab and with other agents in the class 
suggest that the observed serum enzyme elevations do not compromise the safety profile of cabiralizumab and therefore support modification of the safety monitoring criteria.   Serum Enzyme Elevations in Cabiralizumab See above sections for descriptions of serum enzyme elvations in various clinical trials . Based on phase 
1a data from FPA008 003, the management algorithms for hepatic AEs and liver enzyme alterations have been subsequently amended to allow higher cutoffs for serum hepatic enzyme elevations as described in sections 17.1.[ADDRESS_1197518] been used to re-evaluate the safety of 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab monotherapy (7 subjects) and 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab in combination with 3 mg/kg nivolumab (3 subjects).

 will be perfor med for bilirubin, INR, and ALT/AST. In the case of 
elevated CK, additional assessments will be performed for CK isoenzymes (CK- MM, CK-MB, and CK-
BB) and troponins (I or T). The investigator should notify the Sponsor of increased serum levels above specific cutoffs, but below those that would trigger drug modification or discontinuation. Additional 
monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms known to be associated with hepatic damage, per the FDA DILI Guidance, is recommended. These additional measures should be followed as per the guidance in section 17.1.

20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 21 of 84 Rationale for starting dose  
The rationale for starting dose of combination therapy is based upon the dose escalation and expansion 
phases of FPA008-003 as in the Clinical Summary above. Since PPK and exposure response analyses 
support the use of 240 mg Q2W dosing in addition to the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen for nivolumab (see 
Section 1.5), flat dosing of nivolumab at [ADDRESS_1197521] on the PK of cabiralizumab.  
1.7 Rationale 
The tumor microenvironment, composed of non- cancer cells and stroma, is recognized as a major factor 
influencing the growth of tumor cells. Tumor- associated macrophages (TAMs) are particularly abundant 
in the tumor microenvironment and are thought to play a key role in promoting tumor growth. TAMs 
can promote angiogenesis (blood vessel formation in tumors), tumor survival, and metastasis, and may confer resistance to current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. TAMs are also immunosuppressive and through the release of soluble factors and cell surface T cell checkpoint inhibitors can suppress anti-tumor T cell responses [41]. In the majority of tumors increased numbers of TAMs corre late with poor clinical outcome [42], 
supporting TAMs as an attractive therapeutic target. Immunosuppressive TAMs are dependent on CSF1 for survival; a drug that inhibits CSF1R could limit the influence of TAMs on the tumor microenvironment and could be complementary and augment current cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], e.g., checkpoint-based immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_859327]1 or CTLA4 pathways.   Targeting the CSF1R pathway with antibodies or small molecule inhibitors has been shown to be effective in mouse tumor models. In a MC38 colon adenocarcinoma model in syngenei c mice, an anti -
CSF1R blocking antibody resulted in a significant reduction in TAMs, which was accompanied by a positive shift of the CD8 to CD4 ratio toward cytotoxic CD8 T cells[ 30]. This was associated with a 
decrease in FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. These data suggest that other immune effector cells were indirectly influenced by [CONTACT_38247]1R blockade. In a mouse proneural glioblastoma multiform model, small molecule inhibition of CSF1R significantly increased survival, and established tumors regressed[ 29]. In 
this model, TAMs were not depleted, but in the presence of CSF1R inhibition, were pushed to a more proinflammatory phenotype.  In an orthotopic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) model, CSF1R pathway blockade with a small molecule or an anti -CSF1 antibody selectively decreased immunosuppressive TAMs, resulting in 
decreased immunosuppression, and enabled the remaining pro-inflammatory TAMs to support antigen presentation and bolster the anti-tumor T cell response[ 44]. This in turn led to an increased interferon 
response that upregulated T cell checkpoint inhibitors including PD-L1 on tumor cells. This counter regulation served to limit the anti- tumor T cell response through engagement of the T cell inhibitor PD1. 
Importantly, anti- PD1or anti -CTLA4 treatment was able to overcome the PDL1 -mediated inhibition. 
Anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 as single agents showed limited efficacy in restraining PDAC tumor growth 
but combining these agents with CSF1R blockade potently elicited tumor regression even in large established tumors. These data suggest that reprogramming the TAM compartment in tumors by [CONTACT_38247]1R blockade could improve the efficacy of checkpoint- based immu notherapi[INVESTIGATOR_859328]- PD1 
blocking antibody.

In a recent clinical study, RG7155 an anti-CSF1R blocking antibody was tested in patients with various types of solid tumors and was shown to substantially reduce CSF1R+ and CD163+ macrophages in tumors[30]. Similar to what was seen in the mouse model, reduction of TAMs was associated with an 
increase in t he CD8 to CD4 T cell ratio, suggesting that TAM reduction leads to an increased CD8 
cytotoxic T cell response in humans.  Together these data suggest that targeting CSF1R via BMS -[ADDRESS_1197522] 
aberrant expression of CSF1R which can lead to tumor growth (reviewed in section 1.3). Additionally, 
LAMs, which are dependent upon CSF1 for survival, have a well-established role in tumor progression in PTCL (reviewed in section 1.3). Previous clinical trials have shown significant responses to 
checkpoint blockade in patients with PTCL (reviewed in section 1.2). Therefore, we  propose a 
multicenter, phase II study of nivolumab and the antagonistic CSF-1R monoclonal antibody 
cabiralizumab ( BMS-986227) in patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL.

5. TREATMENT PLAN  
This is a single arm phas e II study. Please refer to study schema for overview. Therapy will consist of 
nivolumab 240 mg IV given over 30 minutes (-5/ +15 minutes) followed by 30 minutes (-5/ +15 
minutes) of rest followed by [CONTACT_754437] 4mg/kg IV over 30 minutes (-5/ +15 minutes) . Treatment 
will be given on day 1 of every 14 day cycle. Participants may continue on treatment until withdrawal of 
consent, death, or initiation of another anti- cancer treatment.  
 If a trial participant achieves a complete response (CR) per criteria outlined in section 9, they will 
discontinue study therapy 6 months after confirmed and persistent CR (repeat evaluations required prior to therapy discontinuation as outlined in section 7). This will be followed by a period of observation. Patient will have a physical exam and labs (CBC, CMP, mineral panel, creatine kinase, LDH, amylase, lipase, TSH, free T4, and cortisol) every [ADDRESS_1197530] will be obtained every 6 months; study labs including PBMC, whole blood, and serum will be collected with every imaging evaluation per the schedule of events in section 7. Observation will continue for a period of 2 years; i f at 
any point during the 2 years of observation the patient relapses, they may resume therapy at the time o f 
disease progression. Upon restarting therapy, the schedule of events will resume as if starting at C1D1 of 
therapy (ie PET every 4 cycles, every 2 week office visits with applicable labs, etc).

6. TOXICITIES AND DOSE DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5 will be used to grade adverse 
events.  
 Subjects enrolled in this study will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory tests before and 
at regular intervals during their participation in this study as speci fied in Study Calendar & Evaluations. 
 Subjects will be evaluated for adverse events (all grades), serious adverse events, and adverse events 
requiring study drug interruption or discontinuation as specified in Study Calendar & Evaluations.    Please see section 17.1 for management of toxicities that may arise during the course of treatment. 
6.1 Dose Delays/Dose Modifications 
Guidelines for delaying, restarting, or discontinuing therapy for various toxicities is included in sections 17.1 and 17.2. Dose modifications  are not permitted for this protocol , except if Day 1 weight change by 
>10% necessitates a change in the dosing of cabiralizumab . If therapy is delayed, then next infusion date 
will be considered day 1 of the subsequent cycle. 
 In addition to sections 17.1 and 17.2, please see below for dose delays related to hematologic toxicity:  
• For Grade 1 -2 (neutrophils <LLN to 1,000/µL, hemoglobin <LLN to 8 g/dL, platelets <LLN to 
50,000/µL) 
o Rule out alternative causes  
o Continue cabiralizumab  and nivolumab  therapy 
o Monitor CBC per schedule of events 
o If worsens, treat as grade 3 -4 toxicity  
 
• For Grade 3 -4 (neutrophils < 1,000/µL, hemoglobin < 8 g/dL, platelets < 50,000/µL 
o Rule out alternative causes  
o Delay cabiralizumab and nivolumab therapy. If the AE requiring dose delay was due to one of the study drugs, the non-offending drug may be continued, taking into account the safety and clinical benefit to the patient.  
o Treat autoimmune cy topenias per standard institutional guidelines (examples below): 
 Immune thrombocyoptenia may be treated with steroids, immune globulin, or rituximab  
 Immune mediated hemolytic anemia may be treated with steroids, immune globulin, or rituximab 
 Immune mediate d neutropenia may be treated with steroids, colony stimulating 
factors, or immune globulin 
o If improves to < grade 3:

    BTCRC-HEM16-085 
20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 30 of 84  May resume cabiralizumab and nivolumab therapy per protocol 
o If does not improve or worsens: 
 Discontinue therapy. If the AE requiring discontinuation was due to one of the 
study drugs, the non-offending drug may be continued, if there is timely 
resolution of AE and clinical benefit is shown by [CONTACT_4676]. 
 Continue to treat immune mediated cytopenias per standard algorithms 
 Continue follow up until resolution 
o Grade 3 drug- related thrombocytopenia associated with grade ≥ [ADDRESS_1197537], followed by [CONTACT_859364] 30 -minute infusion. It may be unclear if an infusion reaction is due to cabiralizumab, 
nivolumab, or to both study drugs. Therefore, one set of treatment recommendations (based on the most conservative treatments for infusion reactions due to either study drug) is provided below and may be modified based on clinical judgment, local treatment standards and guidelines, and/or specific symptoms, as appropriate.  For Grade 1 symptoms : Mild reaction (eg, localize d cutaneous reactions including mild pruritus, 
flushing, and rash), requires infusion rate to be decreased; intervention may be indicated. 
• Decrease the rate of the study drug infusion until recovery from symptoms. 
• Remain at bedside and monitor the patient’ s vital signs until resolution of symptoms.  
• Diphenhydramine 50 mg may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician. 
• When symptoms resolve, restart the infusion at the original infusion rate. 
• If a patient has an infusion reaction with nivolumab, cabiralizumab can be given (without 
prophylactic medications) if the infusion reaction resolves within 3 hours. For scheduling 
purposes, the cabiralizumab infusion may be given the next day. Prophylactic pre-infusion medications should be given prior to all subsequent nivolumab infusions. 
• If a patient has an infusion reaction with cabiralizumab, prophylactic pre-infusion medications should be given prior to all subsequent cabiralizumab and nivolumab infusions. 
• The following prophylactic pre-infusion medications are recommended prior to future infusions of cabiralizumab and nivolumab: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) [ADDRESS_1197538] 30 minutes before additional study drug administrations.  
 For Grad e 2 symptoms : Moderate reaction (ie, any symptom not listed above [mild symptoms] or 
below [severe symptoms] such as generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, and hypotension with systolic blood pressure >80 mmHg), requires infusion interruption but responds promptly to

    BTCRC-HEM16-085 
20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 31 of 84 symptomatic treatment (eg, antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, 
corticosteroids, and IV fluids); prophylactic pre-infusion medications indicated for ≥24 hours. 
• Interrupt the study drug infusion. 
• Begin an IV infusion of normal saline and treat the patient with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) 325 mg to 1000 mg. 
• Remain at bedside and monitor the patient’s vital signs until resolution of symptoms. 
• Corticosteroid therapy may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician. 
• When symptoms resolve, restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate; if no further 
complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. 
• Monitor the patient closely. If symptoms recur, immediately discontinue the infusion; no further study drug will be administered at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and remain 
at bedside and monitor the patient until resolution of symptoms. 
• If a patient has  an infusion reaction with nivolumab infusion, cabiralizumab infusion can be 
given (without prophylactic medications) if the infusion reaction resolves within 3 hours. For scheduling purposes, the cabiralizumab infusion may be given the next day. Prophylactic pre -
infusion medications should be given prior to all subsequent nivolumab infusions. 
• If a patient has an infusion reaction with cabiralizumab, prophylactic pre-infusion medications 
should be given prior to all subsequent cabiralizumab and nivolumab infusions. 
• The following prophylactic pre-infusion medications are recommended prior to future infusions of cabiralizumab  and nivolumab: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 
(acetaminophen) [ADDRESS_1197539] 30 minutes  before 
additional study drug administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of SoluCortef or equivalent) may be used. 
• The amount of study drug infused must be recorded. 
 For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms : Severe reaction such as bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, 
systolic blood pressure <80 mmHg, or angioedema; Grade 3 symptoms including prolonged symptoms, 
which require 6 or more hours to respond to symptomatic medication and/or discontinuation of infusion; 
recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138], such as renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates; Grade 4: life -threatening; pressor or 
ventilation support indicated. 
• Immediately  discontinue the study drug infusion. No further study drug will be administered. 
The amount of study drug infused must be recorded on the CRF. 
• Begin an IV infusion of normal saline and treat the patient as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 mg to 1.0 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 mg to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. 
• Remain at bedside and monitor the patient’s vital signs until recovery from symptoms. 
• The patient should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not 
recur. 
• Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for t he treatment of anaphylaxis.

6.3 Protocol Therapy Discontinuation 
The reason for discontinuation of protocol therapy will be documented on the electronic case report 
form (eCRF).  Instructions for management and discountinuation of therapy for common or expected AEs is included in sections 17.1 and 17.2. Please refer to these sections for instructions regarding therapy discontinuation for diarrhea/colitis, hepatic toxicity, renal toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, endocrinopathy toxicity, skin toxicity, neurologic toxicity, periorbital edema, uveitis, and CK or LDH elevation. In addition, criteria for discontinuation due to hematologic toxicity are outlined in section  6.1. In addition 
to these, a subject will also be discontinued from protocol therapy and followed up per protocol under 
the circumstances  outlined below.  
 
• Documented disease progression 
• The treating physician thinks a change of therapy would be in the best interest of the subject 
• The subject requests to discontinue protocol therapy, whether due to unacceptable toxicity or for 
other reasons o If a subject decides to prematurely discontinue prot ocol therapy (“refuses treatment”), the 
subject should be asked if he or she may still be contact[CONTACT_353196]. The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical records and in the eCRF. 
• A female subject b ecomes pregnant  
• Any Grade 3 or higher infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity requiring discontinuation. 
Any re-initiation of therapy in this circumstance would require consultation with the Sponsor’s

1If screening (baseline) labs were performed within 7 days of C1D1 of treatment, these do not need to be repeated.   
2A window of 3 days will be applied to all treatment study visits; for safety follow-up visit, tumor imaging, bone marrow biopsy, and lymph node 
biopsy, a 7-day window will apply. 
3A safety follow-up visit will  occur 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of treatmen t. Subjects who have an ongoing ≥ grade 2 or serious AE 
(SAE) at this visit will continue to be followed until the AE resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline, is deemed clinically insignificant, and/or until a new 
anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever is earlier.  AEs will be collected for 100 days (± 14 days) after the end of treatment. See Section 11.2. 
4Subjects taken off treatment without documented disease progression will be followed for disease progression every 3 months for 1 year .  
5See section 17.3 for Lugano staging system.

8CMP: sodium, potassium, chloride, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen; liver function tests (LFTs) : AST, ALT, total  bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase . 
9Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent 
units of human chorionic gonadotropin) at screening and within [ADDRESS_1197544] will be required.   
10Tumor response assessment  by [CONTACT_10052]/CT will be performed within 30 days of C1D1; after cycles 4, 8, and 12; then every 8 cycles until 24 months 
after initiation of study treatment;  then every 6 months (every 12 cycles) until study discontinuation. If IR determined on response evaluation, 
repeat PET is required in 8 weeks to evaluate for response or progression.  Tumor response should also be evaluated at time of suspected clinical 
progression. If the patient achieves a CR, therapy will be continued for 6 months followed by [CONTACT_859366]/CT to confirm ongoing CR prior to 
therapy discontinuation (see section 5). PET/CT performed as SOC prior to signing consent may be used for study as long as it is  within the 30-
day screening window.  
11Bone marrow biopsy at screening  to include biopsy for immunohistochemistry and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_859331]. If bone marrow is pos itive and 
PET is negative for bone marrow uptake, then bone marrow biopsy will be repeated at the time a radiographic CR is observed to confirm a CR . If 
bone marrow is positive and PET is positive for bone marrow uptake, then a bone marrow biopsy is not ma ndatory for response assessment. For 
patients achieving a CR who have completed an additional 6 months of therapy, a bone marrow biopsy will be performed prior to treatment 
discontinuation to confirm ongoing CR.  If bone marrow and PET are negative, then a bone marrow biopsy will not be repeated unless deemed 
clinically necessary ( e.g. to evaluate cytopenias). Biopsies will be performed with in ±7 days from the time that PET/CT confirms CR . 
12Fresh tumor biopsy is mandatory upon trial enrollm ent unless contraindicated .  FFPE and flash frozen cores for IHC testing for CSF -1R, PD-L1, 
lymphoma associated macrophage s (LAM), regulatory T cell s (Treg), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte s (CTL) must be available.  Biopsy samples will 
include FFPE for future analysis. See CLM for collection, processing, labeling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931]. 
13Repeat tissue biopsy required  only at first imaging assessment (after cycle 4) if residual tumor exists on imaging  and disease i s amenable to 
biopsy. If CR achieved, then no biopsy required. If PR or better response achieved  during trial followed by [CONTACT_859367] e, then repeat biopsy requested  at 
the time of relapse. Window of ±[ADDRESS_1197545] disease assessment (after

20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 36 of 84 7.1 Safety Follow- up Evaluations 
A safety follow-up visit should occur when subjects permanently stop study treatment for whatever 
reason (toxicity, progression, or at discretion of site investigator) and should be performed 30 days (±7 
days) after the last dose of treatment. Subjects who have an y ongoing ≥ grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) at 
this visit will continue to be follo wed until the AE resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline, is deemed clinically 
insignificant, and/or until a new anti- cancer treatment starts, whichever is earlier.  AEs, both serious and 
non-serious, will be collected for 100 days after the end of treatment. See Section 11.2. 
7.2 Long Term Follow- up Evaluations 
All subjects will be followed until documented disease progression. Subjects who discontinue treatment 
for any reason without documented disease progression will be followed for disease progression every 3 
months (±1 4 days) for 1 year.  Follow up may be accomplished via clinic visit, phone call, or other 
avenues as appropriate. 
 
8. BIOSPECIMEN STUDIES AND PROCEDURES  
Biospecimens will be collected according to the schedule of events for correlative/exploratory endpoints 
as outlined below.   1) To examine lymphoma associated macrophage (LAM), regulatory T cell (Treg), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) densities (before and during treatment) as pharmacodynamic and prognostic biomarkers.  
 Please see sections 1.2 and 1.3 for relevant background. Immunohistochemistry will be 
performed on pre- treatment biopsy material and serially compared with a paired “on treatment” 
biopsy performed after cycle 4 (in patients with disease that is amenable to  biopsy). We 
anticipate that therapy will be associated with significant macrophage depletion and increased CTL infiltration (and/or increase the ratio of CTL:Treg), and that these changes within the tumor 
microenvironment may  be predictive of response.  
 
2) To examine the role of PD-L1 and CSF-1R expression as pharmacodynamic and prognostic biomarkers. 
 Please see sections 1.2 and 1.3 for relevant background. Immunohistochemistry will be 
performed on pre- treatment biopsy material and serially compared with a paired “on treatment” 
biopsy performed after cycle 4 (in patients with disease that is amenable to  biopsy). We 
anticipate that pre-treatment PD -L1 and CSF-1R expression may be associated with a response 
to therapy. Treatment is anticipated to deplete CSF -1R expressing cells, including LAM.  
 
3) To examine the abundance of “exhausted” T cells in the peripheral blood as a pharmacodynamic and prognostic biomarker. 
 T cells that are chronically stimulated by [CONTACT_859368] “exhausted” [45]. T-cell exhaustion is characterized by [CONTACT_859369], loss of 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium    Clinical Study Protocol  
    BTCRC-HEM16-085 
20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 37 of 84 effector functions, sustained upregulation of inhibitory receptors (e.g. PD- 1), and altered gene 
expression and metabolic reprogramming [ 45, 46].  
 
Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_859332] T cells will be performed by [CONTACT_4133]. The abundance of “exhausted” T cells will be determined by [CONTACT_137766][INVESTIGATOR_859333] (but are not limited to):  PD -1, LAG-3, CTLA-4, TIM-3, TIGIT, and 
2B4. We anticipate that therapy will decrease the frequency of exhausted T cells and that this may be associated with response.  
 
4) To evaluate the feasibility and utility of minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring as a pharmacodynamic and prognostic biomarker. 
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_859334] T-cell antigens, expression of the T- cell receptor (TCR) is  retained in 
>90% of PTCL, NOS (reviewed in [ 47]). This observation suggests that the TCR may play a 
pathogenic role in PTCL. In fact, we have found that TCR engagement in primary malignant T cells leads to widespread changes in gene expression and the activation of important transcription factors, including NF-κB and GATA-3 (data not shown). Furthermore, TCR  
engagement promotes growth, survival, and resistance to chemotherapy (data not shown). These selective pressures apparently favor maintenance of TCR expression in PTCL and suggest that the TCR is an attractive candidate for MRD monitoring by [CONTACT_5019]-throughput sequencing (HTS). HTS of the third complementarity determining region (CDR3) of the TCRβ or TCRγ genes is able to identify and quantify the relative frequency of clonal T cells in T-cell lymphomas[ 48-52].  
 High throughput screening of CDR3 of the T cell receptor β or γ genes will be used to identify  
and quantify the relative frequency of clonal T cells in patients who achieve a CR. We will also use stored samples from these patients collected at time points prior to frank relapse to determine whether MRD monitoring can be used as a predictor of relapse. We anticipate that detection of MRD in patients with CR will b e predictive of future relapse.  
 
5) To evaluate the role of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) as a pharmacodynamic and prognostic biomarker. 
 MDSC are not a discrete subset of myeloid-derived cells, but are a heterogenous population of 
immature myeloid cells functionally defined by [CONTACT_859370]. In humans, 
MDSC express the common myeloid marker CD33, are CD11b+HLA- DR-/low and generally 
lineage negative (Lin -) (37-39). They  may also variously express the granulocytic marker 
CD15[53] or the monocytic marker CD14 [ 54, 55], suggesting the presence of both granuloc ytic 
and monocytic MDSC [ 22, 56]. MDSC (or at least cells with an identical immunophenotype) 
comprise only a s mall percentage of (~0.5%) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in normal 
humans [22, 57]. During a systemic inflammatory state, as may be observed in malignancy , 
MDSC greatly expand in response to both tumor- and stromal- derived factors and accumulate 
within the bone marrow, peripheral blood, spleen, lymph nodes, liver and tumors [ 22, 54, 58-67].  
 The mechanism of MDSC immunosuppression is mediated by a number of factors including expression of arginase (ARG1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iN OS) [68-70], transforming 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium    Clinical Study Protocol  
    BTCRC-HEM16-085 
20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 38 of 84 growth factor beta (TGF-β ) [71, 72], IL-10[73], cyclooxygenase -2 (COX2) [74], sequestration of 
cysteine [75], and induction of Treg [ 76].  
 
Recently, MDSCs were shown to correlate with clinical outcome of patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] [77, 78] or other immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_859335] -2 [79] or antitumor vaccines 
[80]. These studies highlight the potential role of MDSCs as a valuable biomarker for response to 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_859336], as is possible with CSF1-R blockade, can lead to improved responses to such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [ 81].  
 To evaluate the role of MDSC in PTCL patients treated with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], we will quantify the proportion of circulating MDSC and  myeloid dendritic cells in patients pre and post 
treatment by [CONTACT_4133]. We anticipate that treatment will result in depletion of circulating 
MDSCs and will be predictive of response.   
6) To biobank diagnostic biopsy specimens and other biologic specimens or blood for future correlative studies which may include somatic mutation testing and/or immune cell and cytokine analyses. 
8.1 Source and Timing of Biospecimen Collections

9. CRITERIA FOR DISEASE EVALUATION  
Response evaluations will be performed  in accordance with the provisional Lugano lymphoma response 
to immunomodulatory therapy criteria (LYRIC) which incorporates a new response category, 
indeterminate response (IR) [82]. See Section 17.5. 
 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors, have demonstrated impressive activity in a broad range of lymphoma histologies. However, these agents may be associated with clinical and imaging findings during treatment suggestive of progressive disease (PD) despi[INVESTIGATOR_859337] (eg, tumor flare or pseudoprogression). Considering this finding as PD could lead to patients being prematurely removed from a treatment from which they actually stand  to benefit. This phenomenon has been well described 
with checkpoint blockade therapy in solid tumors and anecdotally seen in lymphoma as well. To address this issue in the context of lymphoma immunomodulatory therapy, a workshop was convened to provide provisional recommendations to modify current Lugano response criteria in patients receiving these and future agents in clinical trials. The criteria are largely in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_859338][83]  but the term “indeterminate response” (IR) was introduced within the LYRIC criteria  to 
identify such lesions until confirmed as flare/pseudo-progression or true PD by [CONTACT_128931].   The term IR does not make direct reference to the underlying mechanism, recognizing that a delayed response and an immune mediated flare can both occur in the early treatment period and may be difficult to distinguish from progression by [CONTACT_859371]. Moreover, the term provides the flexibility to allow patients  to continue treatment past IR in some circumstances with a mandatory 
subsequent response evaluation to confirm or refute true PD.   IR categories are defined as:  
• IR1: Increase in overall tumor burden (as assessed by [CONTACT_859372] [SP D]) 
of ≥ 50% of up to [ADDRESS_1197549] 12 weeks of therapy, without clinical deterioration. 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium    Clinical Study Protocol  
    BTCRC-HEM16-085 
20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 40 of 84 • IR2: Appearance of new lesions or growth of one or more existing lesion(s) ≥50% at any time 
during treatment; occurring in the context of lack of overall progression (<50% increase) of overall tumor burden, as measured by [CONTACT_61904] 6 lesions at any time during the treatment.  
• IR3: Increase in FDG uptake of 1 or more lesion(s) without a concomitant increase in lesion size or number. 
 It is possible that, at a single time point, a patient could fulfill criteria for both IR1 or IR2 and IR3. F or 
example, there could be a new  FDG avid lesion in the absence of overall progression (IR2),  and, at the 
same time, increase in FDG  uptake of a separate lesion (IR3). In such cases, the designation IR1 or IR2  
should take priority (i.e.  IR2 in the above example).  
 As a secondary endpoint, patients will also be evaluated for response by [CONTACT_415580] 2014 criteria (Section 17.6).  
9.[ADDRESS_1197550] target nodes, nodal masses, or extranodal  lesions that are measurable in two 
diameters (longest diameter [LDi] and shortest diameter [SDi]) should be identified from different body 
regions representative of the patient's overall disease burden and include mediastinal and retroperitoneal 
disease, if involved. Measurable extranodal disease (eg, hepatic, splenic, renal, or pulmonary nodules) 
may be included in the six representative, measured lesions.  A measurable node must have an LDi greater than 1.[ADDRESS_1197551] an LDi greater than 1.0 cm. All other lesions (including nodal, extranodal, and assessable disease) should be followed as nonmeasured disease (eg, cutaneous, GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites).  
9.[ADDRESS_1197552] Overall Response 
Based on definitions provided in section 17.5  9.3 Definitions for Response Evaluation – LYRIC criteria  
See section 17.5 for table outlining response criteria including indeterminate response (IR) criteria.  
 In patients categorized as having IR (described in section 9), it is  mandatory to obtain a repeat imaging 
after an additional 8 weeks (or earlier if clinically indicated). At that time, response should be re -
evaluated, and the patient should be considered to have true PD if the SPD of target lesion has increased further, with the considerations below:  
• In the case of  IR1, the comparison should be between the first IR1 and the current SPD, with an 
increase of ≥10% constituting PD. In addition, there should be an increase of ≥5 mm (in either dimension) of ≥1 lesion for lesions ≤2 cm and 10 mm for lesions >2 cm, to be consistent with the Lugano classification. The 10% threshold is empi[INVESTIGATOR_859339] f or variability in 
measurement,  especially wh en taken along with the minimum increase. If the target SPD 
increase is <10%, the respons e would still be categorized as IR1 , and the patient could continue 
treatment until a subseq uent scan shows either true PD ( ≥10% increase from first  IR1 time point 
and an increase of >5 mm in either dimension of ≥1 lesion) or response (≥50% decrease from 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium    Clinical Study Protocol  
    BTCRC-HEM16-085 
20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 41 of 84 baseline). In this situation, repeat imaging in 8 weeks of the original IR1 time point to ensure 
absence of significant further increase.  
• In the case of IR2 , the new or growing lesion(s) (unless biopsy proven to be benign) should be 
added to the target lesion(s), up to a total of no more than 6 total lesions. If the SPD of the newly 
defined set of target lesions has increased ≥50% from their nadir value (which may precede the IR time point), the patient should be considered to have PD. 
• In the case of IR3 , because inflammatory responses may result in an increase in the standardized 
uptake value of a lesion, the patient will not be considered to have PD unless there is evidence of PD by [CONTACT_859373], as noted above. 
 If a patient is assessed as having IR and then “true” PD at a subsequent time point (without an intervening objective response between IR and PD), the IR assessment should subsequently be corrected to PD for reporting purposes to the date of the prior designation of IR.

10.1.[ADDRESS_1197557] common adverse events reported with cabiralizumab monotherapy include periorbital, facial, local and peripheral edema, pruritus, rash, and elevated lab values (CK, LDH, AST, ALT).   Hypersensitivity and/or infusion reaction is the most common toxicity with the use of monoclonal antibodies. There have been no infusion reactions or hypersensitivity reactions reported from any patients treated with cabiralizumab monotherapy to date while one patient in FPA008-[ADDRESS_1197558] been noted, macrophages play a role in innate immunity, and treatment with cabiralizumab may be associated with increased susceptibility to infections. Patients should be routinely monitored for signs and symptoms of infections during cabiralizumab treatment according to the clinical protocol.  
 In combination with nivolumab, the adverse event profile (other than infusion reactions as noted above) is similar to each agent individually.  
10.2 Nivolumab 
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS -936558, MDX1106, or ONO-4538) is a human monoclonal 
antibody (HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets the programmed death-1 (PD -1) 
cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes.1 Binding of PD- 1 to its lig ands, programmed 
death–ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. 
Inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen-specific T -cell responses to both foreign anti gens as well as  self-antigens. 
 Nivolumab is approved in the [LOCATION_002] for use in melanoma, non- small cell lung cancer, renal cell 
carcinoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma.  
10.2.1 Supplier/How Supplied  
Bristol-Myers Squibb will supply nivolumab at no charge to subjects participating in this clinical trial.  
At the end of the study period, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company will not continue to supply study drug to subjects/investigators unless the Sponsor-Investigator chooses to extend their study. The investigator is responsible to ensure that the subject receives appropriate standard of care or other appropriate treatment in the independent medical judgement of the Investigator to treat the condition under study.   
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium    Clinical Study Protocol  
    BTCRC-HEM16-[ADDRESS_1197559] in accordance with the protocol and any applicable laws and regulations. 
10.2.2 Preparation  
Nivolumab injection is to be administered as an IV infusion through a 0.2-micron to 1.2-micron pore 
size, low-protein binding (polyethersulfone membrane) in- line filter at the protocol-specified doses and 
infusion times. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. Nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted (10 mg/mL) or diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to protein concentrations as low as 0.35 mg/mL.   During drug product preparation and handling, vigorous mixing or shaking is to be avoided. Care must be taken to assure sterility of the prepared solution as the product does not contain any antimicrobial preservative or bacteriostatic agent. Nivolumab infusions are compatible with polyvinyl chl oride (PVC) 
or polyolefin containers and infusion sets, and glass bottles. 
10.2.[ADDRESS_1197560] be stored at 2ºC to 8ºC (36 ºF to 46ºF) and protected from light and 
freezing. 
 
The administration of nivolumab infusion must be completed within 24 hours of preparation. If not used immediately, the infusion solution may be stored under refrigeration conditions (2°C to 8°C, 36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours, and a maximum of 8 hours of the total 24 hours can be at room temperatur e 
(20°C to 25°C, 68°F to 77°F) and room light. The maximum of [ADDRESS_1197561] common adverse events include pneumonitis, colitis, diverticular perforation, hepatitis, endocrinopathies (hypophysitis, thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency), pancreatitis, asymptomatic amylase/lipase elevations,

11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1 Adverse Event  (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence whether or not considered related to the study drug that 
appears to change in intensity during the course of the study. The following are examples of AEs:  
• Unintended or unfavorable sign or symptom 
• A disease temporal ly associated with participation in the protocol 
• An intercurrent illness or injury that impairs the well-being of the subject 
 Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests    Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129297] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) should not be recorded as an AE.  
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) 
An SAE is an adverse event that : 
• Results in d eath. NOTE: Death due to disease progression should not be reported as a S AE, 
unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_3987](s) 
• Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] >24 hours or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
NOTE: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693937], central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, ma y jeopardize the subject or may require intervention (e.g., medical, 
surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above). Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
• Is an overdose (defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that is considered by [CONTACT_859374].) All occurrences of overdose must be reported as an SAE.

    BTCRC-HEM16-085 
20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 46 of 84 • Although pregnancy, overdose, potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI), and cancer are not 
always ser ious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs. 
11.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  
For this study, an AE is considered unexpected when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current IB, package insert, or wh en it is not included in the informed 
consent document as a potential risk. Unexpected also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or are anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but 
are not specif ically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
 
11.1.4 Relatedness  
AEs will be catego rized accordi ng to the likelihood that they are related to the study drug(s). 
Specifical ly, they will be categorized using the following terms: Relatedness

    BTCRC-HEM16-085 
20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 50 of 84 12.3 Sample Size, Accrual , and Interim Futility Anal ysis 
We propose a two -stage design with co -primary endpoints of complete response (CR) and overall 
response (OR), testing a “both-and” null hypothesis against an “either-or” alternative hypothesis. 
Specifically, we posit that a CRR of 30% or ORR of 60% is achievable (note that CRR refers to the marginal CRR, that is, the complete response rate without respect to overall response status, and not the 
conditional  CRR, which would be the complete response rate among any responders). Initially, 17 
eligible patie nts will be followed for response. At this point, if fewer than 3 patients demonstrate CR 
(<18%) and fewer than 7 patients demonstrate OR (<41%), the trial will be stopped for futility.   Otherwise, we will enroll an additional [ADDRESS_1197566] 7 patients (out of 33 total) demonstrate CR (21%) or at least 17 patients demonstrate OR (52%).   We will also formally incorporate three Grade 4+ adverse event (AE) threshold s that will activate at 
the interim analysis. First, if the number of patients with any Grade 4 AE is greater than or equal to 7 
(7/17=41%) by [CONTACT_145864], enrollment will stop. Second, if the number of patients with 
Grade 4 AEs that require discontinuation of study treatment, as specified in section 6.3, is greater 
than or equal to 3 (3/17=12%) by [CONTACT_145864] , enrollment will stop. Third, enrollment will 
stop at the interim analysis for any Grade 5 AE attributable to drug.  To demonstrate the operating characteristics of this design, we simulated repeated trials under a grid of 
different true values of CRR , ORR, and Grade 4+ AE rate. When the true CRR and ORR are 
simultaneously no greater than 10% and 30%, respectively, and the true Grade 4+ AE rate is 32%, this 
design will successfully conclude with probability less than 0.05 (one-sided type I error) and stop ( for 
futility or safety collectively) at the interim analysis with probability about 0.75.  When the true CRR is 
at least 30% or the true ORR is at least 60%, this design will successfully conclude with probability at 
least 0.62 (power) and stop at the interim analysis with probability at most 0.34. The schematic in Figure 
1, immediately below, gives the full operating characteristics over all considered combinations of CRR 
and ORR when the true Grade 4+ AE rate is 32%. The blue-purple region denotes the true generating 
scenarios satisifying the ‘either -or’ hypothesis, wherein at least one of the efficacy thresholds is met or 
exceeded. The green region denotes satisifying neither the null nor the alternative hypothesis, wherein both efficacy rates exceed their null values but neither meets the alternative. The red region denotes the ‘both-and’ null hypothesis.

To demonstrate the effect of our toxicity stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], Figure 2 below gives the operating 
characteristics of our design when the true Grade 4+ AE rate is 50%. The entire region is shaded red, 
because the treatment regimen is unacceptably toxic. The probability of declaring success, even wh en 
one of the efficacy thresholds is satisfied in truth , is always less than 0.16, and the trial stops at the 
interim analysis with probability at least 0. 83.

12.6 Data Analysis Plans 
The primary analysis will compare the observed OR and CR rates to posited null values of 30% and 
10%, respectively. We will calculate score-based confidence intervals for binomial proportions. At the critical values of 17/33 and 7/33, the confidence intervals for the ORR and CRR would be (35.2%, 67.5%) and (10.7%, 37.8%), respectively.The analyses of secondary safety objectives will be conducted using tabulations of adverse events, stratified by [CONTACT_859377].   The analyses corresponding to secondary efficacy endpoints ( PFS, DCR, DOR, TNT ) will be 
summarized with typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] ‘time -to-event’ analyses.  
 With regard to the exploratory objectives, we will evaluate pre-post changes in LAM, Treg,CTL, “exhausted” T cell, and MDSC  densities, as well as lymphoma cell and tumor microenvironment 
expression of PD-L1 and CSF-1R. We posit that changes in some or all of these biomarkers will correlate with response, thus demonstrating potential as prognostic biomarkers. We will als o evaluate 
MRD status in patients achieving CR and hypothesize that patients with CR but detectable MRD will predict relaps.  We will quantify these associations using visual and statistical summarization.

17.1 Management of toxicities 
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Site Investigator and may be supplemented by 
[CONTACT_859386]. The guidance applies to all immuno-oncology (I -O) agents 
and regimens. A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according 
to standard medical practice. Non -inflammatory etiologies should be considered and appropriately 
treated. Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno-oncology drug- related adverse events. The 
oral equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with low- grade 
toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids. Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, is recommended. The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by [CONTACT_70744]-oncology agent or regimen being used.

20SEP2019 rev. Confidential Page 62 of 84 17.1.1 Gastrointestinal toxicity  management 
 
Gastrointestinal  Adverse Event  Management  
Rule out noninflammatory  causes. If a noninflammatory  cause is identified,  treat accordingly  and continue nivolumab  therapy. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]/narcotics  may 
mask symptoms  of perforation.  Infliximab  should not be used in cases of perforation or sepsis. 
Grade of  Diarrhea/Colitis  Management  Treatment  and Follow-Up 
Grade 1: Diarrhea:<4  stools/day  
over baseline; Colitis: 
asymptomatic  – Continue cabiralizumab  and nivolumab  
therapy per protocol 
– Symptomatic treatment – Close monitoring for  worsening symptoms  
– Educate patient to report worsening immediately  
If worsens: 
– Treat as Grade 2 or 3/4 
Grade 2: Diarrhea: 4–6 stools 
per day over baseline; IV fluids 
indicated <24 hours;  not 
interfering  with ADL; Colitis: 
abdominal  pain; blood in stool – Delay cabiralizumab  and nivolumab  
per protocola 
– Symptomatic treatment If improves  to Grade 1 ≤4 days: 
– Resume cabiralizumab  and nivolumab therapy per protocol  
If persists ≥5–7 days or recurs: 
– 0.5–1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or oral equivalent 
– When symptoms  improve to Grade 1, taper steroids over at least 1 
month, consider prophylactic antibiotics  for opportunistic 
infections,  and resume cabiralizumab  and nivolumab therapy per 
protocol 
If worsens or persists >3-5 days with oral steroids: 
– Treat as Grade 3 or 4 
Grade 3– 4: Diarrhea (G3): ≥7 
stools per day over baseline; 
incontinence;  IV fluids ≥24 
hours; interfering  with ADL; 
Colitis (G3): Severe abdominal  
pain, medical intervention  
indicated,  peritoneal  signs 
 
Grade 4: Life-
threatening,  perforation – Delay or Discontinue  cabiralizumab  
and nivolumab  therapy per 
protocolb 
– 1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone IV 
or IV equivalentc 
– Add prophylactic antibiotics for 
opportunistic  infections  
– Consider lower endoscopy  if clinically  
indicated If Grade 3 AE improves  to Grade 1 or baseline within 28 days: 
– Taper steroids over at least 1 month 
– Resume dosing of cabiralizumab  and Nivolumab 
If Grade 4: 
– Permanently  discontinue  cabiralizumab  and Nivolumab 
– Continue steroids until Grade 1, then taper steroids over at least 1 month 
If persists >3-5 days, or recurs after improvement:  
– Add infliximab  5 mg/kg (if no contraindications)  
– Follow up until resolution 
– Note: Infliximab  should not  be used in cases of perforation or sepsis 
a. If the AE requiring dose delay was  due to one of the study drugs, the non-offending drug may be continued,  taking into  account the safety  and clinical 
benefit to the patient 
b. If the AE requiring discontinuation  was due to one of the study drugs, the non-offending drug may be continued,  if there is timely resolution  of AE and 
clinical benefit is shown by [CONTACT_4676] 
c. Patients on IV steroids may be switched to an equivalent  dose of oral corticosteroids  (e.g. prednisone)  at start of tapering or earlier, once sustained clinical 
improvement  is observed.  Lower bioavailability  of oral corticosteroids  should be taken into account when switching to the equivalent  dose of oral 
corticosteroids.

Study Design
E2006 -G000 -304 is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, active comparator (ZOL), 
parallel -group study of 2 dose levels of lemborexant for 30 nights in approximately 950 subjects 55 years or 
older with insomnia disorder. Subjects will be males 65 years or older or females 55 years or older. 
Approximately 60% of the subjects will be age 65 years or older. (revised per Amendment 03)
The study will have 2phases :The Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase. The 
Prerandomization Phase will comprise [ADDRESS_1228433] up to a m aximum of 35 days: a Screening Period, 
a Run-in Period, and a Baseline Period. The Randomization Phase will comprise a Treatment Period during 
which subjects are treated for 30 nights ,and a minimum 14-day Follow -up Period before an End of Study 
(EOS) Visit. (revised per Amendment 02)
Throughout the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase, all subjects will undergo routine safety 
assessments at specified visits, including questioning regarding adverse events (AEs), 12-lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs ), vital signs, weight, height, clinical hematology and chem istry analysis and 
urinalysis ,and s uicidality . 
Screening Period
The Screening Period will begin no more than 35days before the subject is randomized.  At the first visit, 
informed consent will be obtained after the study has been fully explained to each subject and before the 
conduct of any screening procedures or assessments.  A medical, psychiatric, and sleep history interview will be 
conducted, and will include confirm ation that the subject meets diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder, and 
further that the subject complains of difficulties with sleep maintenance and/or early morning awakening.
Screening assessments will include the ISI, as well as the Epworth Sleepin ess Scale (ESS), STOPBang, 
Internation al Restless Legs Scale (IRLS), and Munich Parasomnia Scale (MUPS), collectively called the Sleep 
Disorders Screening Battery (SDSB). Other assessments administered will include the FSS and EQ-5D-3L.  
Additional eligib ility criteria will be assessed and safety assessments including the electronic Columbia -Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) will be conducted.   (revised per Amendment 02)
Eligible subjects will be provided with an electronic device on which they will complete the Sleep Diary.  
Subjects will be trained in the use of thisdevice .  Site staff will instruct subjects to complete the diary each 
morning within [ADDRESS_1228434] 7 consecutive mornings ,and provided that the Sleep

FINAL : (v7.0), 05Feb2018ConfidentialPage 4of 109Diary entries indicate continued eligibility with regard to sleep timing, duration of time spent in bed, and 
frequency of nights with symptoms of insomnia , subjects will undergo the second screening visit.  (Subjects 
who are not eligible based on Sleep Diary entries will return to the clinic for debriefing purposes and to return 
study equipment.) This visit must occur between Day -17 and Day  -10.  On this and all n ights on which PSG is
recorded, subjects will arrive atthe clinic in the evening with sufficient time before bedtime to comple te check -
in procedures, any scheduled assessments, and preparations (eg, electrode montage placem ent) for the PSG 
recordings. In addition, at check -in before all visits at which PSG is to be recorded, subjects will undergo a 
urine drug test. (revised per Amendment 02)
After check -inhas been completed, study personnel will familiarize subjects with the postural stability 
assessment (Cognitive Drug Research [CDR ]posture assessment ) and will also conduct a minimum of 2 
training sessions forthe cognitive performance assessment battery (PAB).  Subjects will then undergo an 
8-hour PSG recording, to start at the median habitual bedtime (MHB) as calculated from the Sleep Diary 
entries .  The PSG recording will include channels in the electrode montage to screen for symptoms of sleep 
apnea and periodic limb movement disorder.   Within [ADDRESS_1228435] posture and 
PAB assessments will be administered under the same conditions (eg, timing of assessments relative to 
waketime, ambient lighting), as will be employed during the testing sessions .  The CDR posture and PAB 
assessments at this time are for familiarization purposes only.  At 1.5 hours after waketime , subjects will rate 
their morning sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_347209].  ThePSG will be reviewed for exclusion criteria related to symptoms of sleep 
apnea and/or periodic limb movement disorder .  Subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will then 
be dispensed PBO tablets (single -blind) and will enter the Run -in Period.
Run-in Period
The Run-in Period will begin when eligible subjects are dispensed PBO tablets and will continue until the 
Baseline Period on Day 1.  During the Run-in Period subjects will take PBO each night immediately (ie, within 
5 minutes) before bedtime (defined as the time the subject intends to try to fall asleep ).  They will be reminded 
that they must remain in bed for at least [ADDRESS_1228436] continues to report sWASO 
≥[ADDRESS_1228437] posture and 
PAB assessments, willcomplete the Sleep Diary , and willrate their morning sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_879314] 1.5 hours after 
waketime . (revised per Amendment 01)  The PSG recording will be reviewed for continued eligibility and

Efficacy Assessments
Polysomnography (PSG)
Each PSG recording will include an electrode montage with electroencephalography (EEG), electromyograph y 
(EMG), electrooculography , and ECG channels, for scoring of sleep param eters and sleep architecture via 
standard sleep scoring criteria.  In addition, the first PSG will include channels for assessment of symptoms of 
sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder .
Trained PSG scorers w ill score PSG records in [ADDRESS_1228463] criteria.   The PS Gat the 
second screening visit will be used only to calculate the Apnea-Hypopnea Index and the Periodic Limb 
Movements with Arou sal Index for evaluation of eligibility criteria; sleep parameters and sleep architecture will 
not be evaluated from this PSG.  The 2 PSGs obtai ned during the Run-in Period will be used to a) determine 
eligibility and b) derive baseline PSG parameters for those subjects who are randomized.
All PSG param eters will be obtained separately for each PSG recording and averaged across the pairs of 
consecutive PSG nights.
The follow ing parameters will be derived from all PSGs:
LPS:  minutes from lights off to the first epoch of 20 consecutive epochs of non -wakefulness
SE:  proportion of time spent asleep per time in bed (TIB), calculated as TST/interval from lights off until 
lights on
WASO :  minutes of wake from the onset of persistent sleep until lights on 
WASO2H :  minutes of wake during the interval from 240 minutes after lights off until lights on 
TST:  minutes of sleep from sleep onset until terminal awakening 
Mean duration of long awakenings (DurLongAw ):  average duration of all long awakenings (with long 
awakening defined as 10 or more consecutive epochs [ie, 5 minutes or longer] scored as wake or N1, 
initiated with at least one epoch of wake, after onset of persistent sleep, and including any terminal 
awakening)
Additional sleep architecture parameters will also be calculated from each PSG, including:
Sleep onset latency : minutes from lights off to thefirst epoch of any stage of sleep (N1, N2, N3, REM)
(revised per Amendment 01)
 Number of awakenings after persistent sleep, with an awakening defined as at least 2consecutive epochs

Electronic Sleep Diary
The Sleep Diary will be completed within an hour of morning waketime on each morning of the study from 
Screening through the end of the study.  Sleep Diary entries may be maintained in paper format as a backup to 
the electronic Sleep Diary, if necessary.  This Sleep Diary will yield several self -reported measures of sleep that 
will be used to determine eligibility, as well as to assess efficacy and safety.   In addition, the Sleep Diary will 
include questions that relat e to morning sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_879324].   (revised per Amendment 02)
Sleep parameters :
Subjective Sleep Onset Latency (sSOL) :  estimated minutes from the time that the subject attempts to sleep 
until sleep onset 
Subjective Wake After Sleep Onset (sWASO) :  sum of estimated minutes of wake during the night after 
initial sleep onset until the time that the subject stopped trying to sleep for the night
Subjective Total Sleep Time (sTST) :  derived minutes of sleep from sleep onset until the time the subject 
stopped tryi ng to sleep for the night
Subjective Sleep Efficiency (sSE) :  proportion of sTST per subjective time spent in bed, calculated as the 
interval from the time the subject report edattempt ingto sleep until the time the subject stopped trying to 
sleep for the night , and time spent asleep derived from subjective time spent in bed minus sWASO
Quality of Sleep:
The Sleep Diary will also be used to assess the subject’s perception of the quality of sleep on the previous night 
with the following question , “How  would you rate the quality of your sleep last night?”  Subjects will rate the 
quality of th eir sleep on a scale from 1 to 9 with 1 being extremely poor and 9 being extremely good .
Morning Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] :
The Sleep Diary will also be used to assess subjective ratings of morning sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_879325]: “How sleepy/alert do you feel this morning?”  Subjects will rate their sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]/alertness level on a 
scale from [ADDRESS_1228464] to be discharged from the clini c.
Alcohol Consumption:
The Sleep Diary will include questions to askwhether the subject consumed alcohol the previous day within 3 
hours before bedtime, or exceeded the daily maximum of 2 alcoholic drinks, or both. (revised per 
Amendment 01)
Insomnia Severity Index 
The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity and impact of insomnia. The 
dimensions evaluated are severity ofsleep onset, sleep maintenance, early -morning awakening problem s; sleep 
dissatisfaction; interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of the sleep problems 
by [CONTACT_2312]; and distress caused by [CONTACT_238797]. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (from  
0= no problem to 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score from 0 to 28.

The FSS is a self-report scale on which subjects are instructed to choose a number from 1 to 7 that indicates 
their degree of agreement with each of 9 statements about their fatigue where “1” indicates strongly disagree 
and “7”, strongly agree. The FSS score is the sum of all responses to the [ADDRESS_1228465] posture device measures directional trunk movements (ie, body sway) through 
a cord placed around the subject’s waist and connected to the ataxiameter.  On the evening of the Screening 
PSG visit, subjects will be introduced to the CDR posture assess ment.  Subjects will stand on a firm surface 
with feet comfortably apart, either barefoot or wearing socks .  The standing position (inside heel-to-inside heel 
distance) and barefoot/socks conditions will be documented to ensure they remain the same for a given subject 
at each postural stability assessment timepoint.  They will be instructed to stand as still as possible with eyes 
closed for 1minute.  (revised per Amendment 01) On the morning after the Screening PSG, subjects will 
complete a CDR posture assessment session for familiarization purposes only; no data from this session will be 
used for analyses.  This session must be conducted under the same conditions (eg, starting within 5 minutes of 
morning waketime, at bedside) as during the testing session s at subsequent visits.
Body  sway is detected through the cable around the subject’s waist by [CONTACT_879414] a laptop. Body  sway is measured in units of 1/3° of the angle of arc. For ease in reporting these 
will be called arbitrary units, with a higher number indicating more body sway (less postural stability). 
Cognitive Performance Assessment Battery
A computerized PAB will be administered on a laptop computer after the postural stability test.  (revised per 
Amendment 01)  While completing the PAB, subjects will be in bed and am bient lighting will be maintained at 
a level of 80 –[ADDRESS_1228466]’s eye level.   On the evening of the Screening PSG visit, before bedtime, 
subjects will be intro duced to the PAB tasks and will undergo a minimum of 2 training sessions. If subjects 
cannot adequately perform  the tasks during the training sessions, they will be excluded from further 
participation.   On the morning after the Screening PSG, subjects willcomplete a session of the cognitive PAB 
for familiarization purposes only; no data from this session will beused for analyses .  This session must be 
conducted under the same conditions (eg, lighting, subject in bed) as during the testing sessions at subsequent 
visits.
The PAB comprises 9tasks including Simple Reaction Time, Choice Reaction Time, Digit Vigilance, 
Immediate Word Recall, Delayed Word Recall, Numerical Working Mem ory, Spatial Working Mem ory, Word 
Recognition, and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_879326].  The full PAB will take approximately 18to 30minutes to complete .  
Four composite domain factor scores are calculated by [CONTACT_879415].  
The four domain factor scores are Power of Attention, Continuity of Attention, Quality of Mem ory, and Speed 
of Memory Retrieval.
Power of Attention
oA composite score from the speed scores of 3 tests of attention

(Score = 2).  The sum of r esponses will be the subject’s score. (revised per Amend ment 02)
Other Assessments
EQ-5D-3L
The EQ-5D-3L is a generic instrument that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care, 
and to collect data on quality of life and preference s/utility. The instrument comprises questions on mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, and a visual analogue scale from 0 (“Worst 
imaginable health state”) to 100 (“Best imaginable health state”).
Patient Global Imp ression –Insomnia 
The PGI-Insomnia is a self-report assessment asking about subjects’ perception sof the effects of the study 
medication on their sleep relative to their sleep before entering in the study.  As such, the PGI-Insomnia does 
not have a baseline and the outcome is not change from baseline, but rather the global impression of the study 
medi cation’s effects at the end of treatment. The PGI-Insomnia has 3 items related to study medication effects 
(a)helped/w orsened sleep, (b)decreased/increased time to fall asleep, (c)increased/decreased total sleep time,
and [ADDRESS_1228467] 3 items are answered on 
a 3-point scale (1=positive medication effect, 2=neutral medication effect, 3=negative medication effect) and 
the last item on a different 3 -point scale (medication: 1=too strong , 2=just right, 3=too w eak).
Bioanalytical Methods
Plasma concentrations of lemborexant and its metabolites (M4, M9, and M10) and zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] (as needed ), will 
be measured using validated liquid chromatography -tandem  mass spectrometry assay methods.
Statistical Methods
All statistical tests will be based on the 5% level of significance ( 2-sided ).

The LPS change from baseline (the mean of Days 1 and 2, and the mean of Days 29 and 30) will be analyzed 
using the mixed effect model repeated measurement analysis (MMRM) on the FAS. The model will include all 
data and will be adjusted forthe corresponding b aseline value (the means from the 2 PSG recordings during the 
Run-in Period), region , age group (55<65years; 65 years or older), treatment, time (Day s 1/2, and Days 
29/30), and the interaction oftreatment by [CONTACT_5586](revised per Amendment 04).  Since LPS is known to be non-
norm ally distributed, a log-transformation will be used in the analysis. An unstructured covariance matrix will 
be used, and if the model fails to converge, then an autoregressive matrix willbeused.The missing values will 
be imputed using a pattern mixture model utilizing multiple imputation s(MI) assuming the missing values are 
missing not at random (MNAR) utilizing the complete case missing value pattern (CCMV -subjects who 
completed prim ary efficacy assessments without missing values) (revised per Amendment 04).  The missing 
values for a given visit will be im puted using all available values including the retrieved measurement from the

7.1 Indication 
7.1.1 Current Therapeutic Options 
Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by  [CONTACT_879425], sleep maintenance, 
or early morning awakening, in association with a complaint of impairment during the 
daytime.  Insomnia is a widespread problem in industrialized nations, with approximatel y 
30% of the population having symptoms and at least 6% meeting diagnostic criteria for 
insomnia meriting treatment .  Currentl y available pharmacological treatments used for 
insomnia include benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], non-benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] γ-aminobuty ric acid (GABA)
receptor agonists (GABAergics), a recentl y approved dual orexin receptor antagonist 
(DORA), sedating antidepressants, melatonin and melatonin agonists, antihistamines, and 
other prescription and non -prescription medications with sedative properties .  
The current commercial environment is generic, with the non-benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ,zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] 
(Ambien®),leading in prescriptions in the US. Other so-called “z-drugs” including zaleplon 
and eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123], contribute substantially  to market share as well.   However, there are 
efficacy  and safety  concerns associated with the use of z-drugs, particularly  zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], 
particularl yinolder patie nts.  This limite defficac yis characteristic ofshort -acting non-
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_879343] t unmet medical need, as sleep 
maintenance insomnia is the most prevalent type of insomnia experienced in aging. Up to 
50% of individuals over age 55 report difficulty maintaining sleep.   The recentl y approved 
DORA, suvorexant, was show nin clinical trials to significantly  improve sleep maintenance 
insomnia, but at the starting dose approved for use, showed suboptimal efficacy .
7.1.2 Lemborexant (E2006)
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action
Lemborexant, E2006, (1R,2S)-2-{[(2,4 -dimethy lpyrimidin -5-yl)oxy]methy l}-2-(3-
fluorophen yl)-N-(5-fluoropy ridin -2-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide belongs to the 
pharmacologic class of orexin receptor antagonists .
Orexin neuropeptides (orexin -A and orexin -B) have been recognized as critica l upstream 
controllers of most wake -promoting neurotransmitters via twoGprotein -coupled receptors, 
the orexin -[ADDRESS_1228506] recently  emerged as a new class of chemical compounds 
that represents a novel alternative approach to treat insomnia disorder. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Experience with Lemborexant
[IP_ADDRESS].1 PHASE 1
E2006 -A001 -001 (Study 001):  single ascending dose study .  This study included healthy 
subjects and otherwise healt hy subjects with primary  insomnia.  In addition to determining 
Clinical Study Protocol
Per Amendment 04E2006 -G000 -304
Eisai
FINAL : (v7.0), 05Feb2018ConfidentialPage 33of 109the safet y and tolerability  of single doses, the study  provided preliminary  evidence of 
efficacy  in the target patient population.
E2006 -A001 -002 (Study 002):  multiple ascending dose study .  This study  enrolled healthy 
adult and elderl y subjects, each of whom was dosed with lemborexant or placebo at night.  In 
addition to determining the safet y and tolerability of multiple doses, the study  also provided 
preliminary  evidence of a lack of importa nt differences in exposure between adult and 
elderl y subjects.  
E2006 -A001 -003 (Study 003):  A multiple dose study  to bridge pharmacokinetics (PK) , 
pharmacod ynamics (PD), safet y and tolerability  between Japanese and white healthy 
subjects .  This study  provided evidence of a lack of important differences in exposure and 
safet y between Japanese and white subjects.
E2006 -A001 -004 (Study  004):  metabolism -based inducer/inhibitor study .  This study  
provided data demonstrating (1) strong inhibitors of CYP3A lead to higher plasma 
concentrations of lemborexant ; and (2) strong inducers of CYP3A lead to notably  lower 
plasma concentrations of lemborexant . The study  also demonstrated a weak effect of 
lemborexant on CYP2B6 activity  and no effect on CYP3A activity .
E2006 -A001 -005 (Study  005):  relative bioavailability  study of capsules vs tablet 
formulations.  This study  demonstrated that the capsules and tablets provided similar 
exposure (maximum observed concentration [Cmax]and area under the concentration -time 
curve [ AUC]), thus allowing the tablet formulation to be used in future clinical trials.
E2006 -A001 -007 (Study 007):  human mass balance absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion study  to characterize the route and extent of excretion of lemborexant . This 
study  demonstrated that elimination takes place by [CONTACT_122686] (57%) and urinary  excretion (29%) 
based on total recovery (86.5%) of radioactivity  following a single dose of radiolabeled 
lemborexant . In addition, there were no human -specific metabolites and the only major 
(12%) metabolite was M10.   The blood -to-plasma ratio was approximately  0.65.
E2006 -A001 -008 (Study 008):  food effect study .  This study  demonstrated a mild food 
effect.  The Cmax was decreased by  23% and the area under the concentration -time curve from 
zero time extrapolated to infinite time (AUC [0-inf])was increased by 18% following 
consumption of a high fat meal .
E2006 -A001 -107 (Study 107):  This Phase 1 study  was conducted to evaluate the effects of 
the 5 and 10 mg doses on next-morning residual sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_879344].  The study  design was randomized, double -blind, and placebo (PBO) -controlled
with a 3-way crossover.  Next-morning residual sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_879345] a modified 
multi ple sleep onset latency  test (M-MSLT).  An active comparator, flurazepam 30 mg, was 
included to confirm assay sensitivity .  Results showed that for neither 5 mg nor 10 mg was 
the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the treatment difference in change

[IP_ADDRESS].2 PHASE 2
A dose-finding study  (E2006 -G000 -201; Study 201) was conducted in subjects who had
insomnia disorder, with the primary  objectives of identify ing doses that resulted in efficacy 
but did not result in significant next-day residual sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. The doses evaluated were 1, 
2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 25 mg, administered once daily for 15days.Thestudy  was stopped early 
for efficacy  after the prespecified success criterion for sleep efficiency  (SE) was achieved 
without unacceptable next-day residual sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_879346] (KSS) .
As measured by [CONTACT_25899]  (PSG), improvements in sleep were also demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_879426], and by [CONTACT_879427] (LPS) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) .  These changes 
were largel y maintain ed over 15days of treatment with lemborexant as compared with 
placebo.  Subjective measures derived from sleep diary  entries yielded results largel y 
comparable to PSG-derived results .  Further, there was no evidence of rebound insomnia 
after treatment was completed, as measured either by  [CONTACT_879428] .
At doses up to 10mg, changes from baseline in next-day sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], as measured by [CONTACT_879429],did not differ from those after placebo.  At the highe st doses of 15and 25 mg, the 
increase in KSS from baseline was statistically  significantly  different from placebo at some
time points , but the increases in KSS were of small magnitude (ie, less than 1 unit on 
average) .  Although there was approximately  a two-fold accumulation of lemborexant in 
plasma over the 15-day Treatment Period , next-day sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_879347] .

E2006 -G000 -304 is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, active 
comparator (ie, ZOL), parallel -group study  of 2 dose level s of lemborexant for 30 nights in 
approximately  950 subjects 55 years or older withinsomnia disorder.   Subjects will be m ales
65 years or older or females 55 years or older.  Approximately  60% of the population will be 
age 65 years or older.   (revised per Amendment 03)
The study  will have [ADDRESS_1228512] up to a maximum of 35days: a 
Screening Period, a Run-in Period, and a Baseline Period. The Randomization Phase will 
comprise a Treatment Period during which subjects are treated for 30 nights followed by a 
minimum 14 -day interval before an End of Stud y(EOS) Visit.  (revised per Amendment 02)
Throughout the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase , all subjects will 
undergo routine safety  assessments at specified visits , including questioning regarding AEs, 
12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs ), vital signs, weight, height, clinical hematology  and 
chemistry  analysis and urinaly sis, and s uicidalit y.  
Estimates for End of study are as follows:

TheScreening Period will begin no more than [ADDRESS_1228515] screening visit (Visit 1), informed consent will be obtained after the study  has been 
fully explained to each subject and before the conduct of any screening procedures or 
assessments.  A medical, psychiatric, and sleep history  interview will be conducted, and will 
include confirmation that the subject meets diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder, and 
further that the subject complains of difficulties with sleep maintenance or early morning 
awake ning, or both. Screening assessments will include the ISI, as well as the Epworth

the Munich Parasomnia Scale (MUPS), collectively  called the Sleep Disorders Screening
Battery  (SDSB). Additional eligibility  criteria will be assessed andsafety assessments will
be conducted as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and summarized in Table 4.(revised per 
Amendment 02)
Subjects will be provided with an electronic device on which they will complete the Sleep

which PSG is to be recorded, subjects will arrive at the clinic in the even ing with sufficient 
time before bedtime to complete check -in procedures, any scheduled assessments, and 
preparations (eg, electrode montage placement) for the PSG recordings.   In addition, at 
check -in before all visits at which PSG is to be recorded, subjects will undergo a urine drug 
test.  (revised per Amendment 02)
After check -in has been completed, study  personnel will familiarize subjects with the 
postural stability  assessment (CDR posture assessment ) and will also conduct a minimum of 
2training sessions for the cognitive performance assessment battery  (PAB).  Subjects will 
then undergo an 8-hour PSG recording, to start at the median habitual bedtime (MHB) as 
calculated from the Sleep Diary  entries.  The PSG recording will include channels in the 
electrode montage to screen for symptoms of sleep apnea and periodic limb movement 
disorder .  Within [ADDRESS_1228517] posture and PAB assessments 
will be administered under the same conditions (eg, timing of assessments relative to

recordings will be used to further screen for eligibility , and will serve as baseline values for

9.2.3 Efficacy Assessments
The study  uses objective (PSG) as well as subjective (Sleep Diary) assessments of efficacy .  
Both assessments have been widel y used in registration trials evaluating treatments for 
insomnia disorder.  While PSG indicates that a measurable physiological effect ofthe study 
drug has occurred, Sleep Diary outcomes indic ate the magnitude of the effect for the patient.  
(revised per Amendment 03)
Another focus of this study  is on WASO2H, a measure of sleep maintenance in the second 
half of the night.  The rationale for the selection of this endpoint is based on the loss of effect 
of ZOL on sleep maintenance at the end of the sleep period.  However, any benefit on 
WASO2H observed with lemborexant must not be due to a worsening of sleep latency  or 
continuity  at the beginning of the night.  Therefore, analy ses of both LPS and total WASO as 
well as other PSG variables (eg, total sleep time [TST], number and duration of awakenings) 
will be conducted to confirm the efficacy  of lemborexant on sleep onset and sleep 
maintenance.   (revised per Amendment 03)

formulation of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] (Allain, et al., 2003 , Mets ,et al.,2010 ,and Boyle,et al.,2009 ;

zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_879352]  1.[ADDRESS_1228532] of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_879353]  (Stranks and Crowe ,2014 ).  
With regard to postural stability  as measured in this study , zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_879354] 4.5 hours after dosing (Wesnes, et al., 2000 ).  
Further, there is consistent evidence that the effects on postural stability of hypnotic drugs 
are larger after the first one or two nights of dosing and dissipate thereafter, which has been 
explained as due tobehaviora ltoleranc e(Mets ,etal.,2010 ).For this reason, thekey 
secondary  objective for the current study  is to compare the effects of lemborexant to those of 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_879355], in the morning shortly  after 
waketime on Day 2 and Day 3.  Whether there are differential effects of lemborexant and

While the lower age is not the typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 65years defining “elderl y,” it is physiologicall y 
meaningful, as insomnia incidence increases at middle age in both men and women, with a 
particularl y steep increase in incidence in women at menopause.   In addition, the 
homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep are disturbed in many  older individuals, which 
manifests most frequently as sleep maintenance insomnia in the second halfof the night, and 
early morning awakening.  The preponderance of sleep maintenance issues in the second half 
of the sleep period is clear from the literature as well as supported by [CONTACT_879433]  201.   (revised per Amendment 03)

FINAL :  (v7.0), 05Feb2018Confidential Page 53of 1099.4.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
At Baseline, subjects will be randomized, in a double -blind manner, to receive LEM5, 
LEM10, ZOL, or PBO in a 5:5:5:4 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_879435] (55to 64 years; 65 years or older).  Randomization to study  treatments will be 
based on a computer -generated randomization scheme that will be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_879436].  The randomization scheme and identification for each subject 
will be included in the final clinical study  report for this study .
Randomization will be performed centrall y by [CONTACT_76692] 
(IxRS).  The IxRS or clinical supply vendor will generate the randomized blister card 
identification numbers.  At enrollment (and after successful completion of study  procedures 
the morning of Day 1), the investigator or designee will call the IxRS to register the subject 
information.  At Randomization (morning of Day 1), the IxRS will assign each subject a 
unique [ADDRESS_1228554] primary objective of balancing significant efficac y 
as measured by [CONTACT_879437][INVESTIGATOR_879367].  The second primary  objective was also achieved, as there 
were no significant increases in the KSS at 1 hour after waketime at the end of treatment.  
However, there were dose-related increases in the KSS at both the beginning and end of 
treatment, and the rate of AEs of somnolence also increased with increasing dose level.  
In Study  201,lemborexant 5 mg and 10 mg showed significant efficacy  measured by [CONTACT_288483], as 
well as decreases in sleep onset latency .  These effects were maintained across the 15-day 
Treatment Period .  For sleep maintenance, lemborexant 10 mg showed significant decreases, 
and while the magnitude of decreases in WASO was less for 5 mg, there was a significant 
proportion of subjects whose WASO decreased substantiall y, providing evidence for clinical 
benefit of 5 mg on sleep maintenance as well.  
Because of the observed dose -related increases in subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_879368]  201, Study  107 was conducted to obtain additional information about the risk of 
clinicall y meaningful morning residual sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].  The study  assessed average sleep onset 
latency  on the M-MSLT after a single dose of LEM5 or LEM10 versus PBO .  The results 
indicated that the pre-specified threshold for a clinicall y meaningful decrease in average sleep 
onset latency  was not met by [CONTACT_28261] 5 mg or 10 mg dose level of lemborexant, supporting 
their use in the Phase 3 clinical trials.  Taken together with the efficacy  and safety results for 
lemborexant 5 mg and 10 mg in the Phase 2 study , these dose levels were selected for the 
current study .

[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS].1 POLYSOMNOGRAPHY
Each PSG recording will include an electrode montage with electroencephalography  (EEG), 
electrom yograph y (EMG), electrooculograph y, and ECG channels, for scoring of sleep 
parameters and sleep architecture via standard sleep scoring criteria.  In addition, the 
screening PSG will include channels for assessment of sy mptoms of sleep apnea and periodic 
limb movement disorder .
Trained PSG scorers will score PSG records in 30-second epochs according to standard 
criteria.   The PSGat the second screening visit will be used only to calculate the Apnea -
Hypopnea Index and the Periodic Limb Movements with Arousal Index for evaluation of 
eligibility  criteria; sleep parameters and sleep architecture will not be evaluated from this 
PSG.  The 2 PSGs obtained during the Run-in Period will be used to a) determine eligibility 
and b) derive baseline PSG parameters for those subjects who are randomized.
All PSG parameters will be obtained separately  for each PSG recording and averaged across 
the pairs of consecutive PSG nights.
The following parameters will be derived from all PSGs:
LPS:  minutes from lights off to the first epoch of 20 consecutive epochs of non -
wakefulness
SE:  proportion of time spent asleep per TIB, calculated as TST/interval from “lights off” 
until “lights on”
WASO :  minutes of wake from t he onset of persistent sleep until lights on 
WASO2H :  minutes of wake during the interval from 240 minutes a fter lights off until 
lights on
TST:  minutes of sleep from sleep onset until terminal awakening 
Mean duration of long awakenings (DurLongAw) :  average duration of all long 
awakenings (with long awakening defined as 10 or more consecutive epochs [ie, 
5minutes or longer] scored as wake or N1 , initiated with at least 1 epoch of wake , after 
onset of persistent sleep, and including an y terminal awakening

relationship to study  drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the 
subject signs the study  ICF through the last visit.  Serious adverse events (SAEs )will be 
collected for [ADDRESS_1228570] dose.
Abnormal laboratory  values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibility  of the 
investigator to review all laboratory  findings in all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory  abnormality should be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory  abnormality 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Abnormal ECG (QTc F) results, if not otherwise considered part of a clinical sy mptom that is 
being reported as an AE, should be considered an AE if the QTcFinterval is more than 
450msec and there is an increase of more than 60msec from baseline.  Any ECG 
abnormality  that the investigator considers as an AE should be reported as such.
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to review the results of the eC-SSRS in all subjects 
and determine if any result constitutes an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether an isolated suicidality  rating scale response should be 
classified as an AE (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]   for a description of the eC-SSRS ). 
AEs in clinical investigation subjects include any change in the subject’s condition.  This 
includes symptoms, physical findings, or clinical syndromes.  All AEs encountered during 
the clinica l study  will be reported on the eCRF .  
All AEs must be followed for [ADDRESS_1228571]’s last dose, or until resolution,

ASSESSING SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS
AEs will be graded on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in the detail 
indicated on the eCRF.  The definitions are as follows:
Mild Discomfort noticed, but no disr uption of normal daily  activity
Moderate Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily  activit y
Severe Incapacitating, with inability  to work or to perform normal daily  activity

PATIENT GLOBAL IMPRESSION –INSOMNIA 
The PGI-Insomnia questionnaire is a self-report assessment asking about a subject ’s 
perception of the effects of the study  medication on their sleep relative to their sleep before 
entering in the study .  As such, the PGI-Insomnia does not have a baseline and the outcome 
is not change from baseline, but rather the global impression of the study  medication’s 
effects at the end oftreatment. The PGI-Insomnia has 3 items related to study  medication 
effects (a:  helped/worsened sleep, b: decreased/increased time to fall asleep, and c: 
increased/decreased TST) and [ADDRESS_1228575] 3 items are answered on a 3-point scale (1=positive 
medication effect, 2=neutral medication effect, 3=negative medication effect) and the last 
item on a different 3 -point scale (medication :  1=too strong, 2=just right, 3=too weak).  Each 
item will be reported separatel y.  This scale was used in studies of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] (Roth et al., 
2006 ; Walsh et al., 2008 ).

The scheduling of stud y procedures and assessments is shown in Table 4.
9.5.[ADDRESS_1228577]’s rating of sleep qualit y each 
night and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]/alertness level in the morning.  The ISI has been widely  used to evaluate 
the subjective impact of insomnia sever ity on psy chosocial functioning, which is one type of 
daytime functioning impairment experienced by [CONTACT_879450].  The FSS 
measures fatigue, which is another t ype of day time impairment that is often a consequence of 
insomnia.  This scale has been employ ed primarily  in clinical trials of cognitive and 
behavioral treatments for insomnia disorder. Because theobjectives of this study  include 
assessing the response to lemborexant of both nighttime sleep and daytime impairment 
complaints, the ISI and the FSS will be evaluated for changes from baseline.  The PGI-
Insomnia and EuroQoL assessment (version EQ-5D-3L)will also be employ ed.  Both 
measures have been used in studies evaluating the impact of treatment for insomnia on the 
patients’ global perceptions of sleep quality  and quality  of life. Together these measures will 
provide a broad evaluation of the effects oflemborexant on each patient’s sleep, daytime 
functioning, and quality  of life.
The CDR posture and cognitive PAB will assess whether there are residual effects of study  
drug on morning postural stability  and cognition.  There are documented effects of hypnotic 
drugs, including zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], on postural stabilit y and certain cognitive domains in the morning 
hours.  These effects are associat ed with an increase drisk of falling and other negative 
effects on functioning in the morning hours.  The measures to be employ ed to evaluate the 
effects on postural stability  and cognition have been widely  used in clinical trials of drugs in 
older individ uals, including clinical trials of treatments for insomnia disorder. 
9.5.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, Pregnancy, and Events Associated 
with Special Situations
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, regardless of their relation ship to study treatment, 
must be reported on a completed SAE form by [CONTACT_3202] 24 hours from the time the investigator becomes aware of theevent.   (revised

For urgent safety issues please ensure all appropriate medical care is administered to the 
subject and contact [CONTACT_354568] y team member listed in the I nvestigator Study  File.
It is very important that the SAE report form be filled out as completel y as possible at the 
time of the initial report.  This includes the investigator’s assessment of causality .
Any follow -up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 24 hours of its 
receipt.  (revised per Amendment 01)If the follow -up information changes the investigator’s 
assessment of causality , this should also be noted on the follow -up SAE form.
Preliminary  SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by [CONTACT_3582][INVESTIGATOR_3103], autops y reports, and other documents requested by 
[CONTACT_456].
The investigator must notify  his/her IRB/IEC of the occurrence of the SAE in writing, if 
required b y their institution.  A cop y of this communication must be forwarded to the sponsor 
or the responsible CRO, to be filed in the sponsor’s Trial Master File.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug Through Breastfeeding
Although the female subject population will be postmenopausal, in the event that a 
pregnancy  does occur, investigato rs will c apture and report such events .
Any pregnancy  in which the estimated date of conception is either before the last visit or 
within [ADDRESS_1228579] be reported.
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy  is suspected to be related to study  drug exposure, this 
should be reported regardless of the length of time that has passed since the exposure to stu dy 
treatment.
A congenital anomal y, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous 
abortion are considered to be an SAE and should be reported in the same time frame and in 
the same format as all other SAEs (see Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
[Section [IP_ADDRESS] ]).
Pregnancies or exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding must be reported by [CONTACT_3208] 24 hours after the time the investigator becomes

of the outcome.   (revised per Amendment 01)
A subject who becomes pregnant must be withdrawn from the stud y.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Events Associated wit h Special Situations
Adverse events associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error 
refer to AEs associated with uses of the study  drug outside of that specified by [CONTACT_760].  
Overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error are d efined as follows:
Overdose Accidental or intentional use of the study  drug in an amount higher 
than the protocol -defined dose
Misuse Intentional and inappropriate use of study  drug not in accordance with 
theprotocol
Abuse Sporadic or persistent intent ional excessive use of study  drug 
accompanied b y harmful physical or ps ychological effects
Medication error Any unintentional event that causes or leads to inappropriate study 
drug use or subject harm while the study  drug is in the control of site
personne lor the subject.  
All AEs associated with overdose , misuse, abuse, or medication error should becaptured on 
the Adverse Event CRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) even if the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  
Investigators should report whether one or both study  drugs had been taken incorrectl y. 
Abuse is alway s to be captured as an AE.  If the AE associated with an overdose, misuse, 
abuse, or medication error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the 
SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form 
and the Adverse Event eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Expedited Reporting
The sponsor must inform investigators (or as regionall y required, the head of the medical 
institution) and regulatory authorities of repor table events, in compliance with applicable 
regulatory  requirements, on an expedited basis (ie, within specific time frames).  For this 
reason, it is imperative that sites provide complete SAE information in the manner described 
above.

All studies that are conducted within any  European country  will comply  with European Good 
Clinical Practice Directive 2005/28/EC and Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC.  All 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported, as required, to the 
competent authorities of al l involved European member states.
9.5.5 Completion/Discontinuation of Subjects
For purposes of entering subject disposition in the eCRF, a subject will be considered to have 
completed the study  per protocol after the End of Study  visit has been completed. (revised 
per Amendment 01) For analysis purposes, asubject will be considered to have completed 
the study  once the assessments on the morning after the last dose of study  drug have been 
completed .  All subjects will be required to return to the clinic at least 14, but not more than 
18 day s later for an End of Study  (EOS )visit. 
The investigator or subject may  elect to discontinue thesubject’s participation in the study  at 
any time for any reason.  Subjects who discontinue study  drug prematurel y at any time after 
randomization at Visit 5(Baseline) will be encouraged to return to the site as soon as 
possible (preferably  within 7 days)toundergo an early termination (ET)Visit, as described 
in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 4). 
If the investigator or sponsor discontinues the study  prematurel y, the investigator will 
promptly  explain to the subject involved that the study  will be discontinued for that subject 
and will provide appropriate referral for medical treatment and other necessary  measures for 
the subject.  A subject who has ceased to return for visits will be followed up by  [CONTACT_2319], phone, 
or other means to gather information such as the reason for failure to return, the status of 
treatment compliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses of signs and 
symptoms.  This information will be recorded in the eCRF.
Subjects who discontinue early from the study  will be discontinued for one of these prima ry 
reasons:  AE(s), lost to follow -up, subject choice, lack of therapeutic effect, or 
administrative/other.  Discontinuations due to non-compliance with study  drug, time spent in

allowed the rational design of new strategies for immunotherapy of tumors, including 
melanoma. It has been known for some time that engagement of the T cell antigen receptor 
by [CONTACT_485349] T cell activation; a second co -stimulatory signal is required 
for induction of IL -2 production, proliferation and differentiation to effector function of 
naive T cells. Abundant data now indicate that the primary source of this costimulation is 
mediated by [CONTACT_485350]28 o n the T cell surface by [CONTACT_151189] B7 family on 
the antigen -presenting cell (APC).1 (Figure 1.)  
Expression of B7 has been shown to be limited to “professional” antigen presenting cells; 
that is, specialized cells of the hematopoietic lineage, including  dendritic cells, activated 
macrophages, and activated B cells. It has been suggested that this sharply -defined 
restriction of B7 expression is a fail -safe mechanism for maintenance of peripheral T cell 
tolerance, insuring that T cell activation can only b e stimulated by [CONTACT_485351].[ADDRESS_623562] 
in pursuing this as an approach to tumor immunotherapy. As demonstrated in vivo in 
murine tumor models, the utility of B7 expression as a vaccination approach is limited by 
[CONTACT_15006]:  (1) B7 -expressing tumor cell vaccines are only effective when the 
tumor cells have a high degree of inherent immunogenicity; (2) while B7 -expressing 
vaccines have been shown in many cases to be effective in inducing protective immune 
responses, th ey have demonstrated only limited utility in inducing responses to established 
tumors; and (3) inactivation of tumor cells by [CONTACT_485352] -enhancing activity of the B7 gene product.5,[ADDRESS_623563] few years it has become apparent that co -stimulation is even more complex than 
originally thought. After activation, T cells express CTLA -4, a close homologue to CD28. 
CTLA -4 binds members of the B7 family with a much higher affinity than 
CD28.7Although there was initially some c ontroversy as to the role of CTLA -4 in 
regulating T cell activation, it has become clear that CTLA -4 down -regulates T cell 
responses.8    
This was initially suggested by [CONTACT_485353]: (1)  blockade of CTLA -
4/B7 interactions with antib ody enhanced T cell responses; (2)  cross -linking of CTLA -4 
with CD3 and CD28 inhibited T cell responses; and (3)  administration of antibodies to 
CTLA -[ADDRESS_623564] spontaneously activated T cells evident at approximately 1 week after birth, followed 
by [CONTACT_485354]. These mice die at approximately 3 
weeks of age, either as a result of polyclonal T cell expansion and tissue destruction or as 
a result of toxic shock resulting from lymphokine production by [CONTACT_941] T  cells. Since 
thymocyte differentiation and se lection proceed normally in CTLA -4-deficient mice, the 
rampant T cell expansion that occurs in the mice indicates that CTLA -4 plays a critical role 
in down -regulating T cell responses in the periphery.12 
 
 15 Cancer immunotherapy rests on the premise that tumors can be recognized as foreign rather 
than as self and can be effectively attacked by [CONTACT_20397]. An effective 
immune response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveillance of tumor 
antigens expressed on  cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune response 
and cancer cell death. This functions by [CONTACT_485355]/or caus ing tumor shrinkage where it is present. Meanwhile, tumor progression may 
depend upon acquisition of traits that  allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and 
an effective immune response.  This evasion may occur by [CONTACT_485356] t hat control the regulatory immune response, including display of antigens and 
control of co -stimulatory pathways that affect the proliferation of cells involved in 
immunity. Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to break the apparent tolerance of the 
immun e system to tumor cells and antigens by [CONTACT_485357] - 
either directly by [CONTACT_20401] T and  
B cells or indirectly by [CONTACT_20402]. T -cell stimulation is a complex process  
involving the integration of numerous positive, as well as negative, costimulatory signals 
in addition to antigen recognition by [CONTACT_941] T -cell receptor (TCR). 2 Collective ly, these signals 
govern the balance between T -cell activation and tolerance to antigens.1  
 
Programmed death receptor -1 (PD -1, CD279), a 55 kD type I transmembrane protein, is a  
member of the CD28 family of T -cell costimulary receptors that also includes C D28, 
CTLA -4, ICOS, and BTLA.2 PD -1 contains an intracellular membrane proximal 
immunoreceptor tyrosine  inhibitory motif (ITIM) and a membrane distal immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based switch motif  (ITSM). Two ligands specific for PD -[ADDRESS_623565] been identified: 
PD-L1 (B7 -H1/CD274) and PD -L2 (B7-DC/CD273). PD -L1 and PD -L2 have been shown 
to down -regulate T -cell activation upon  binding to PD -[ADDRESS_623566] shown that blockade by [CONTACT_4002] -1 by [CONTACT_485358] (mAbs) can enhance the anti -tumor immune response and result in tumor 
rejection.   Antitumor activity by [CONTACT_4002] -1 blockade functions in PD -L1+ tumors as well as in 
tumors that are  negative for the expression of PD -L1.13,14,15,16,17,[ADDRESS_623567] mechanisms  (ie, expression of PD -L1 in antigen -presenting cells) limit the antitumor 
response. Consequently,  both PD -L1 positive and negative tumors may be targeted using 
this approach. In humans,  constitutive PD -L1 expression is normally limited to 
macrophage -lineage cells, although  expression of PD -L1 can be induced on other 
hematologic cells as well, including activated  T cells. However, aberrant expression of PD -
L1 by [CONTACT_66846] a number of  human 
malignanc ies.19,20,21,22,23,24,[ADDRESS_623568] that tumor over -expression  
(as measured by [CONTACT_4658]) of PD -L1 may permit immune evasion by [CONTACT_15198]. In renal cell 
carcinoma,  high surface expression levels of PD -L1 on tumor cells are related to tumor 
aggressiveness.20,24   Subjects with high tumor and/or lymphocyte PD -L1 levels are 4.[ADDRESS_623569] a worse overall survival rate compared  to low expression levels of PD -L1.27  
 
Nivolumab is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype, mAb that binds PD -1. Blockade of the 
PD-[ADDRESS_623570] by [CONTACT_448278] (M LR). 
PD-[ADDRESS_623571] of nivolumab on antigen -specific recall response was 
investigated using a  CMV -restimulation assay with human peripheral blood mononuclear 
 
 17 cells (PBMCs), and was  evaluated by [CONTACT_6428].  
 
These data indicated that nivolumab, versus an isotype -matched control antibody, 
augmented  IFN-α secretion from CMV -specific memory T -cells in a dose -dependent 
manner. PD -1 blockade  by [CONTACT_195717] a promising 
immunotherapeutic option.  
 
1.3 Summary of Results of Investigational Program  
1.3.1  Pharmacology  of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485247] a human immunoglobulin G (IgG1)κ anti -CTLA -4 monoclonal antibody 
(mAb). In vitro studies were perfo rmed with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485248] -4, actively inhibits CTLA -[ADDRESS_623572] trimester thr ough delivery, at dose levels either 2.6 or 
7.2 times higher than the clinical dose of 3 mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (by [CONTACT_12265]). No treatment -
related adverse effects on reproduction were detected during the first two trimesters of 
pregnancy. Beginning in the third t rimester, the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485249], stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth 
weight), and higher incidences of infant mortality in a dose -related manner compared to 
controls.  
Genetically engineer ed mice heterozygous for CTLA -4 (CTLA -4+/-), the target for 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], appeared healthy and gave birth to healthy CTLA -4+/- heterozygous 
offspring. Mated CTLA -4+/- heterozygous mice also produced offspring deficient in 
CTLA -4 (homozygous negative, CTLA -4-/-). The CTLA -4-/- homozygous negative 
offspring appeared healthy at birth, exhibited signs of multiorgan lymphoproliferative 
 
 18 disease by 2 weeks of age, and all died by 3 –4 weeks of age with massive 
lymphoproliferation and multiorgan tissue destruction.  
Complete information on the pre -clinical toxicology studies can be found in the 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_121002] (IB). Non -clinical t oxicity assessments included in vitro 
evaluation for the potential of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485250] -dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (CDCC) or antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and toxicology 
assessments in cynomolgus monkeys alone and in the presence of vaccines.  
The in vitro studies demonstrated that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485251] - or 
(CD)3 -activated h uman T cells.  However, low to moderate ADCC activity was noted at 
concentrations up to 50 ug/ mL. These data are consistent with the requirement of high 
levels of antigen expression on the surface of target cells for efficient ADCC or CDCC. 
Since ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103955] a human IgG1, an isotype generally capable of mediating CDCC and 
ADCC, the lack of these activities is likely due to a very low expression of CTLA -[ADDRESS_623573] that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485252] T cells in  vivo. Indeed, no depletion of T cells or T cell subsets 
were noted in toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys.  
No mortality or signs of toxicity were observed in three independent 14 -day intravenous 
toxicology studies in cynom olgus monkeys at multiple doses up t o 30  mg/kg/dose. 
Furthermore, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485253] -chronic and chronic toxicology studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys with and without Hepatitis B (HepB)  Vaccine and Melanoma 
Vaccine. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485254]. There were 
no significant changes in clinical signs, body weight values, clinical pathology values or T 
cell activation markers. In addition, there were no significant histopathology changes in 
the stomach or colon.  
 
Preclinical Summary of Nivolumab combined with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485255] -1 and CTLA -4 receptor blockade may  
improve antitumor activity. In vitro combinations of nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251359]-α production 2 - to 7-fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. 
Increased  antitumor activity of the combination was also observed in 3 of 5 syngeneic 
murine cancer  models. In a murine melanoma vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA -
4 or PD -1 antibodies  increased the proportion of CTLA -4 and PD -1-expressing CD4/CD8 
tumor infiltrating T effector  cells, and dual blockade increased tumor infiltration of T 
 
 19 effector cells and decreased  intratumoral T regulatory cells, as compared to either agent 
alone.  
Preclin ically, a 4 -week toxicity study of nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485256] -dependent gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Histologic findings 
include d inflammatory changes in the large intestine, which increased in incidence and 
severity in a  dose-dependent manner. GI toxicity/colitis was not observed in cynomolgus 
monkeys  administered nivolumab alone, but was observed in monkeys receiving 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Nivolumab  in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485257]/or medulla of the thymus and with acinar cell 
degranulation in the pancreas. Additional  findings included interstitial mononuclear cell 
infiltrates  in the kidneys, portal mononuclear cell  infiltrates in the liver and myeloid 
hypercellularity in the bone marrow. Nivolumab in  combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485258]-dose level (ie, 50 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively)  was associated with the death of 
[ADDRESS_623574].  
 
1.3.3  Clinical Pharmacology  
1.3.4 Mechanism of Action  
CTLA -4 is a negative regulator of T -cell activation. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_120967] -4 and 
blocks the interaction of CTLA -4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA -4 has 
been shown to augment T -cell activation and proliferation. The mechanism of action of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]’s effect in patients with melanoma is indirect, possib ly through T -cell mediated

degradation  of monoclonal antibodies is to small peptides and amino acids via biochemical 
pathways that are  independent of cytochrome P450 enzymes.   
The population PK of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485260] 785 subjects and demonstrated that PK 
of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485261] 
0.3 to  10 mg/kg, and the mo del parameters are time invariant. Upon repeated dosing of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  administered every three weeks, minimal systemic accumulation was 
observed by [CONTACT_485360] 1.[ADDRESS_623577] dose. The ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485262] 16.8 mL/h 
from population PK analysis is  consistent with that determined by [CONTACT_411212]. The

ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323355] a weight normalized regimen. Additional details are  provided in 
investigator brochure.  
Nivolumab Monotherapy  
Single -dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was evaluated in subjects with multiple 
tumor  types in MD1106 -01 whereas multiple dose PK is eval uated in subjects in 
CA209003. In  addition, a preliminary population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model has been 
developed with data  from 
  350 subjects from MDX1106 -01, MDX1106 -02 and 
CA209003.   
Single -dose PK of nivolumab was evaluated in 39 subjects with multi ple tumor types in 
study  MDX1106 -01 in the dose range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. The median Tmax across single 
doses  ranged from 1.6 to 3 hours with individual values ranging from 0.9 to 7 hours. The 
PK of  nivolumab is linear in the range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg with dose proportional increase 
in Cmax and  AUC(INF) with low to moderate inter -subject variability observed at each 
dose level (ie, CV  ranging from 7 to 45%). Geometric mean clearance (CL) after a single 
 
 21 intravenous (IV) dose  ranged from 0.13 to 0.19 mL/h/kg, while mean volume of 
distribution (Vz) varied between 83 to  113 mL/kg across doses. The mean terminal T -
HALF of nivolumab is [ADDRESS_623579] model ing using data 
from  350 subjects from MDX1106 -01, MDX1106 -02 and CA209003. The body weight 
normalized  dosing produces approximately constant trough concentrations over a wide 
range of body  weight, and hence is appropriate for future clinical trials of nivo lumab. 
Clearance of nivolumab  is similar in all tumor types studied and is independent of dose 
range studied (0.1 to 10 mg/kg).  
 
1.3.6  Clinical Safety   
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485264]010 -20, the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482463] 3 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485265]  3 weeks for four doses. In this arm, there were 79% drug related adverse events, with 
21% being  Grade 3/4 and 3/131 (2%) Grade 5. The most frequent adverse events of interest 
were rash  (30%), pruritis (33%), diarrhea (33%), colitis (8%), endocrine di sorders (9%), 
AST/ALT  increased (2%), and hepatitis (1%). Any grade immune related adverse events 
were 60% and the  Grade 3/4 immune related adverse events for the same cohort was 13% 
with the most frequent  adverse events being diarrhea (5%), colitis (5%), rash (2%), and 
endocrine disorders (3%).  
Additional details on the safety profile of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], including results from other clinical  
studies, are also available in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162549].  
Nivolumab Monotherapy  
One study has contributed most to the clinical experience with nivolumab monotherapy in  
subjects with melanoma and other solid malignancies. CA209003 is an ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_623580] previously treated 
advanced solid  tumors, including melanoma , RCC, NSCLC, colorectal cancer, and 
hormone -refractory prostate  cancer. Subjects received nivolumab at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 
or 10 mg/kg intravenously every  2 weeks, up to a maximum of 2 years of total therapy. As 
of 03 -Jul-2012, a total of  107 melanoma  subjects were treated with nivolumab in the dose 
 
 22 range of 0.1 -10 mg/kg.  
No maximal tolerated dose was identified in CA209003. The incidence, severity and 
relationship  of AEs were generally similar across dose levels and tumor types. Nivolumab 
related AEs of any  grade occurred in 72.4% of subjects. The most frequent nivolumab 
related AEs occurring in  5% of subjects included: fatigue (25.7%), rash (13.5%), diarrhea 
(11.8%), pruritis (10.2%),  nausea (7.9%), decreased appetite (7.9%), hemoglobin 
decreased (5.9 %) and pyrexia (5.3%).   The majority of events were low grade, with grade 
3-4 drug related AEs observed in 14.8% of  subjects. The most common Grade 3 -4 drug -
related AEs occurring in 
  1% of subjects were:  fatigue (1.6%), lymphopenia (1.3%), 
abdominal pain (1%), diarrhea (1%), hypophosphatemia (1%) and pneumonitis (1%). At 
least one SAE was reported for 150 (49.3%) of the 304 subjects  at all dose levels. Grade 
3-4 SAEs were reported for 23 subjects (7.6%). Drug -related SAEs  occurred in 11.5% of 
subjects. Gra de 3-[ADDRESS_623581] 2 subjects  included: diarrhea (3 
subjects, 1.0%), pneumonitis (3 subjects, 1.0%), pneumonia (2 subjects,  0.7%) and lipase 
increased (2 subjects, 0.7%). Additional select treatment -related AEs have  occurred with  
low frequency (< 5%) but are considered clinically meaningful, as they require  greater 
vigilance for early recognition and prompt intervention. These AEs include: ALT  increased 
(4.3%), AST increased (3.6%), pneumonitis (3.3%), hypothyroidism (3.0%),  
hyper thyroidism (1.3%), renal failure (1.0%), adrenal insufficiency (0.7%) and colitis 
(0.7%).  Grade 3 -4 events of pneumonitis were reported in 3 subjects (1.0%) as described 
above (1 event  was Grade 4). Grade [ADDRESS_623582] increas ed 
were reported in  2 subjects (0.7%) each. Grade [ADDRESS_623583] (0.3%) each. Treatment -
related AEs leading to  discontinuation were reported in 18 (5.9%) of the [ADDRESS_623584] were pneumonitis 
(4 subjects; 1.3%) and hepatitis  (2 subjects; 0.7%). There were 3 (1%) drug related deaths; 
each occurred after development of  pneumonitis.  
Preliminary new non -clinical safety findings of adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant 
losses in  the absence of overt maternal toxicity have been reported.44 The findings of 
increased late stage  pregnancy loss and early infant deaths/euthanasia in nivolumab 
exposed pregnant monkeys  suggest a potential risk to human pregnancy if there is 
continued treatment with nivolumab  during pregnancy.    
Additional details on the safety profile of nivolumab, including results from other clinical  
studies, are also available in the BMS -936558 (nivoluma b) IB.  
 
 [ADDRESS_623585] been studied 
concomitantly  with ascending doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485266]. In  each arm in this multi -arm study, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485267] 3 weeks for 4 doses  with nivolumab administered once every 3 weeks for 8 
doses. Starting at week 24, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485268] 12 
weeks for 8 doses. The three initial  dose-escalation  cohorts consisted of Cohort 1 
(nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg;  n=14), Cohort 2 (nivolumab 1.0 mg/kg 
plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n=17) and Cohort 3  (nivolumab 3.0 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 
mg/kg; n=6). Later, the study was amended to include  Cohort  2a which evaluated 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg (n -16).  The following DLTs were observed 
in Cohort [ADDRESS_623586]/ALT ([ADDRESS_623587]); in  Cohort 2 - Grade 3 uveitis ([ADDRESS_623588]) and Grade [ADDRESS_623589]/ALT ([ADDRESS_623590]) and in  Cohort 3 - Grade 4 elevated 
lipase (2 subjects) and Grade 3 elevated lipase ([ADDRESS_623591]). Based on  these data, Cohort 2 
was identified as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and Cohort [ADDRESS_623592] one AE regardless 
of causality  has been reported in 98% of subjects treated. The most common (reported at > 
10% incidence)  treatment related AEs (any Grade %; Grade  3-4 %: 93; 53) are rash (55; 
4), pruritus (47; 0),  vitiligo (11; 0), fatigue (38; 0), pyrexia (21, 0), diarrhea (34; 6), nausea 
(21, 0), vomiting (11, 2),  ALT increased (21; 11), AST increased (21; 13), lipase increased 
(19; 13), amylase increased  (15, 6) , headache (11, 0), and cough (13, 0).  
The majority of AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality) were Grade 3 or 4  
(reported in 11 of 53 subjects, 21%). Grade [ADDRESS_623593] been  
developed for suspected p ulmonary toxicity, GI, hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathy, skin 
toxicity,  neurological toxicity and renal toxicity. Prompt interventions are recommended 
 
 24 according to the  management algorithms and in addition include ophthalmologic 
evaluations for any visual  symptoms in order to evaluate for nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485269].  
Given the nature of the study and in order to standardize the management of adverse events 
the recommendations are to follow the BMS -936558 (nivolumab) adverse event algorithms  
and not the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485270].  
The algorithms recommended for utilization in CA209067 are contained in Appendix B. 
As of [ADDRESS_623594] developed opportunistic infections (2 cases of Aspergillus pneumonia, 
and 1 case of  Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) after receiving prolonged treatment with 
high dose steroids  for nivolumab -related adverse events. Details of these cases are available 
in the Investigator  Brochure. Because o f the potential for opportunistic infections with 
prolonged high dose  corticosteroids administration, the following recommendations should 
be considered for subjects  with inflammatory events expected to require more than 4 weeks 
of corticosteroids or other  immunosuppressants to manage the adverse event:  
 Antimicrobial/antifungal prophylaxis per institutional guidelines to prevent opportunistic  
infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci and fungal infections.  
 Early consultation with an infectious disease sp ecialist should be considered. Depending 
on the presentation, consultation with a pulmonologist for bronchoscopy or a 
gastroenterologist  for endoscopy may also be appropriate.  
 In patients that develop recurrent adverse events in the setting of ongoing or  prior  
immunosuppressant use, an opportunistic infection should be considered in the differential  
diagnosis.  
Additional details on the safety of nivolumab, including results from other clinical studies, 
are available in the IB.  
1.3.7  Clinical Efficacy: Melanoma Program  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485271], a completed Phase 3 study (MDX010 -20) has demonstrated a clinically  
meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit in pre -treated advanced melanoma. 
The study compared the overall survival (OS) of ipil imumab plus a melanoma -specific 
vaccine  (gp100) to that of gp100 alone. A second comparison defined the OS of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
 
 25 alone vs.  gp100 alone. Both comparisons demonstrated statistically significant 
improvements in OS  (p = 0.0004 and 0.0026, respectively). The 1 -year survival for the two 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -containing  groups, respectively, was 44% and 46% respectively, compared to 
25% for the gp100 control  group. The 2 -year survival was 22%, 24% and 14% respectively. 
The median survival was  10, 10.1, a nd 6.4 months, for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195657]100, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_470286], and gp100  monotherapy, respectively.  
Nivolumab Monotherapy  
In CA209003, the clinical activity of nivolumab was demonstrated in a variety of tumor 
types,  including melanoma, RCC, and NSCLC. C linical activity was noted across a range 
of doses   (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg).  
In CA209003, as of the clinical cut -off date of [ADDRESS_623595] been evaluated for clinical activity. A response of 
either CR  or PR, as determined by [CONTACT_485361] , has been reported at all dose levels. No responses (CR or PR) have been 
reported in subjects with  colorectal carcinoma or castrate -resistant prostate cancer.  
Among 106 patients with advanced melanoma who received nivolumab and were evaluable 
for response, the preliminary objective response rates were 6/17 (35%), 5/18 (28%), 11/34 
(32%),  7/17 (41%), and 4/20 (20%) for melanoma subjects tr eated at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 
mg/kg,  respectively. Duration of response range from 3.6 to 11.2, 1.8 to 9.2, 1.9 to 24.9, 
9.2 to 22.4, and  17.0 to 25.7 months in the melanoma subjects treated at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 
10 mg/kg,  respectively. Stable disease 
  24 weeks occurred in an additional 1/18 (6%), 
4/34 (12%),  1/17(6%) melanoma subjects at 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg, respectively. Finally, the 
PFS-24 week was  41%, 33%, 48%, 55%, and 30% in melanoma subjects treated at 0.1, 
0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg,  respectively.  
Nivolumab Combined with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485272] 15 -Feb-2013 clinical cut -off in CA209004, of the 52 subjects evaluable for 
response,  21 subjects (40%) had an objective response by [CONTACT_485362] (mWHO)  criteria. In an additional [ADDRESS_623596] s (4%) there was an unconfirmed 
objective response. In Cohort  1 (0.1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), 3 out of 14 
evaluable subjects had an objective  response by [CONTACT_143884] (21%); 1 CR and 2 PRs with an 
additional PR by [CONTACT_44859] -related mWHO  criteria (irPR).  55 In Cohort 2 (1 mg/kg 
nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), 9 out of 17 evaluable  subjects had an objective response 
by [CONTACT_143884] (53%; 3 CRs (18%), 6 PRs (35%) with two  additional subjects experiencing 
immune -related SD (irSD). In Cohort 2a (3 mg/kg nivolumab +  
1 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), 6 out of 15 response evaluable subjects had an objective response 
rate by  [CONTACT_143884] (40%; 1 CR (7%), 5 PRs (33%) with 2 additional uPRs (13%) and 2 irSDs 
and 1 irPR).   In Cohort 3 (3 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), 3 out of 6 evaluable 
subjects had an  objective response by [CONTACT_143884] (50%; 3 PRs (50%) with 1 additional irPR 
and 1 irSD.  
Preliminary analysis revealed 16 of the 52 evaluable subjects (31%) had > 80% reduction 
in the  size of target tumor lesions by [CONTACT_68069] 12 evaluation.  This is compared to < 2% for 
 
 26 3 mg/kg  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143721]184020 (N=540) and < 3% for nivolumab 
monotherapy  based on CA209003 (N=94, 0.1 -10 mg/kg).  
1.3.7. a Rationale  for Using Immune -Related Tumor Assessment Criteria 
(irRC)  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485273] i mmuno -stimulating antibody with evidence of anti -cancer activity 
(durable objective response and stable disease) in subjects with advanced melanoma, 
including subjects with established brain disease. Observations of clinical activity defined 
by [CONTACT_485363] (eg, mWHO) may be 
inadequate to realize the kinetics and magnitude of clinical benefit achieved with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
Histopathologic evidence has demonstrated ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485274]. Therefore, early increases in lesion size detected 
radiologically or upon gross examination could be misinterpreted as progressive tumor 
growth and precede objective tumor shrinkage. In addition the appearance of new lesions 
may have categorized a subject to have progressive disease using conventional tumor 
assessment criteria despi[INVESTIGATOR_485275] -
existing lesions and a net reduction in global tumor burden that includes the new les ions.  
Hence the appearance of new lesions in and of themselves may not necessarily constitute 
progressive disease. The immune -related response criteria (irRC) were developed as a tool 
to gauge tumor response using the changes in global tumor burden. In add ition, the irRC 
may be useful to inform a physician’s decision to continue dosing in subjects who may 
receive benefit from additional ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224]. The ir -response assessment is based 
solely on objective measurements (SPD) of index and new lesions. N on-index lesions are 
not considered.  
1.3.7 .b MDX010 -20 (Phase 3, 3 mg/kg, previously treated melanoma)  
MDX010 -20, a randomized (3:1:1), double -blind, double -dummy study included 
676 randomized subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma previously tr eated with 
one or more of the following: aldesleukin, dacarbazine, temozolomide, fotemustine, or 
carboplatin. Of these 676 subjects, 403 were randomized to receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3  mg/kg 
in combination with an investigational peptide vaccine with incomplete  Freund’s adjuvant 
(gp100), 137 were randomized to receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3 mg/kg, and 136 were randomized 
to receive gp100 alone. The study enrolled only subjects with HLA A2*0201 genotype; 
this HLA genotype facilitates the immune presentation of the inves tigational peptide 
vaccine. The study excluded subjects with active autoimmune disease or those receiving 
 
 27 systemic immunosuppression for organ transplantation. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/placebo was 
administered at 3 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 do ses. 
Gp100/placebo was administered at a dose of 2 mg peptide by [CONTACT_485364] 3 weeks for four doses. Assessment of tumor response was conducted at Weeks 12 
and 24, and every 3 months thereafter. Subjects with evidence of objective tum or response 
at 12 or 24 weeks had assessment for confirmation of durability of response at 16 or 28 
weeks, respectively.  
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  + gp100 
arm compared to that in the gp100 arm. Secondary  efficacy outcome measures were OS in 
the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] + gp100 arm compared to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772], OS in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485276]100 arm, best overall response rate (BORR) at Week 24 between each 
of the study arms, and duration of response.  
Of the randomized subjects, 61%, 59%, and 54% in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] + gp100, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
and gp100 arms, respectively, were men. Twenty -nine (29%) percent were  65 years of 
age, the median age was 57 years, 71% had M1c stage, 12% had a history of previously 
treated brain metastasis, 98% had ECOG performance status of 0 and 1, 23% had received 
aldesleukin and 38% had elevated LDH level. Sixty -one (61%) percent of subjects 
randomized to either ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -containing arm received all 4 planned doses. The median 
duration of follow -up was 8.9 months.  
The OS results are shown in Table 5 and Figure 2.

continued to receive maintenance ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485281],  for a median of 4 and 2  doses, 
respectively. The number of patients who received all 8 dacarbazine doses was 12.2% in 
the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772], and 21.5% in the placebo arm.  
The study met its primary end -point of prolonging overall survival in patients treated with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (HR 0.72 (95% CI, 0.59 – 0.87), median OS 11.2 vs 9.1 months, p  = 0.0009).

1.3.7. d  10 mg/kg Dosing with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485285], Phase 3 studies show improved survival at both 3 mg/kg (study 
MDX010 -20) as well as with 10 mg/kg (study CA184024). Several additional conducted 
trials studied the efficacy and safety of 10 mg/kg dosing, and additional information gained 
from these trials is lis ted below:  
 A dose of 10 mg/kg is necessary to ensure a blockade of the CTLA -[ADDRESS_623600]: in vitro  
a concentration of 20 g/mL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485286] -4 to B7.1 and B7.2. With a dose of 3 mg/kg q3 w 30% 
achieved a trough concentration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485287] 20 g/mL, compared to 
95% of subjects treated at 10 mg/kg q3w.  
 In addition, in all ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485288], mean Absolute Lymphocyte 
Count (ALC) increased after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485289] t throughout the 12 -week induction -
dosing period, in a dose -dependent manner. In an analysis of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 0.3, 3, or 
10 mg/kg in melanoma studies CA184007, CA184008, and CA184022 combined, the 
rate of change in ALC after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485290] (p = 0.0003), with the largest rate at 10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Moreover, the rate of 
change in ALC over the first half of the induction -dosing period was significantly 
associated with clinical activity in these studies (p = 0.009) , where clinical activity was 
defined as CR, PR, or prolonged SD (ie, SD lasting at least [ADDRESS_623601] dose). 
Although these analyses alone could not determine whether the rate of change in ALC 
was specifically associated with clinical activity in r esponse to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777], 
as opposed to being generally prognostic, these results do suggest a potential benefit to 
higher rates of ALC increase after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777]. Among the 3 doses evaluated, 
10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485291]. 
 In the 3 primary studies conducted in advanced melanoma (CA184007, CA184008, 
and CA184022), subjects treated with 10 mg/kg during the induction period had the 
 
 [ADDRESS_623602] response, disease control rates, median OS as well as 1 -year and 2 -year survival 
rates compared to other doses. The CA184022 data are summarized in Table  8.

Source:  Reference 16-[ADDRESS_623603] immune  cell phenotype rendering them more susceptible to 
alternate checkpoint inhibitors and thereby  [CONTACT_104094] -tumor activity. Specifically, 
nivolumab increased peripheral CTLA -4+ and  regulatory T cells in subjects without 
clinical response in CA209006.48 In a preclinical  melanoma model, anti -CTLA -4 therapy 
increased PD -1+, PD -L1+ and CTLA -4+ tumor  infiltrating T cells.49 In addition, in the 
Phas e 2 ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485295]184004,  increases in tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) and interferon -α-inducible genes were  observed following treatment 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and PD -L1 positive tumor cells co -localize with  both TILs and IFN-α 
expression  in metastatic melanoma.50, 51,52  
The preliminary clinical evidence has demonstrated a higher frequency of patients with  
substantial tumor burden reduction for the combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. 
 
 35 Improved  overall survival associated with substanti al tumor burden reduction has been 
noted with  immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. For instance, improved overall survival has been noted in 
metastatic  melanoma subjects obtaining a complete response to IL -2.53 If this observation 
is also applicable  to treatment with nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485296].  
Dose and Schedule Rationale  
In CA209004, the 3 mg/kg nivolumab and 3 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485297]. In CA209004, while both Cohort 2 (1 mg/kg 
nivolumab + 3 mg/kg  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) and Cohort 2a (3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) had similar clinical  activity, a dose of 3 mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43852] 3 weeks 
for a total of four do ses and 1 mg/kg  nivolumab every 3 weeks for four doses followed by 
[CONTACT_20382] 3mg/kg every 2 weeks until  progression was chosen. Exposure -response 
analysis of nivolumab monotherapy across dose  ranges of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg reveals 
similar clinical activity while exposure -response analysis  of 0.3 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 
mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485298] 2 study CA184022.54 Therefore, theoretically the  selection of 3 mg/kg 
of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Coh ort 2) may be more clinically impactful than selection of  3 mg/kg of 
nivolumab (Cohort 2a) .   
The combination arm has a similar dose and schedule as that in CA209004 for the first [ADDRESS_623604] that the approved  schedule for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_448153] 3 weeks for a total 
of four doses in the FDA and EMA  approved label dosing section, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485299] 3 weeks for a total of  4 doses. Nivoluma b monotherapy treatment 
every two weeks until progression was studied in  CA209003 and is implemented program -
wide across the nivolumab monotherapy Phase 3  registrational trials.  
 
Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensively studied in a number of tumor type s 
including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 
and colorectal  cancer (CRC) with body weight normalized dosing (mg/kg). Nivolumab 
pharmacokinetics (PK)  and exposures of subjects in these studies have been characterized  
by [CONTACT_485368] (PPK) analysis of data collected in these studies, together 
 
 [ADDRESS_623605] shown that the PK of nivolumab are linear, wi th dose 
proportional exposures over a dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, and are similar across 
tumor types. Nivolumab clearance  and volume of distribution were found to increase with 
increasing body weight, but the increase  was less than proportional, indicating that a mg/kg 
dose represents an over -adjustment for the  effect of body weight on nivolumab PK. Given 
the relationship between nivolumab PK and body  weight, a flat dose is expected to lead to 
lower exposures in heavier patients, relative to the  exposures in lighter patients.  
Using the PPK model, nivolumab steady -state trough, peak and time -averaged 
concentration  (Cminss, Cmaxss, and Cavgss, respecti vely) were predicted for a flat 
nivolumab dose of 240 mg  Q2W and compared to those following adminis tration of 3 
mg/kg Q2W in NSCLC, melanoma,  and RCC subjects. A dose of 240 mg nivolumab is 
identical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for subjects  weighing ~ 80 kg, which is the approximate 
median body weight of subjects in the Phase 2 and 3  BMS clinical studies of ni volumab 
monotherapy. From the simulations, the geometric mean  values of Cminss, Cmaxss, and 
Cavgss with flat dosing are slightly (< 15%) higher than that  produced by a 3 mg/kg dose, 
and the coefficient of variation (cv%) in these measures of  exposure are o nly slightly (< 
10%) greater than that of 3 mg/kg dosing. Given the similarity of  nivolumab PK across 
tumor types and the similar exposures predicted following administration  of a 240 mg flat 
dose compared to 3 mg/kg, it is expected that the safety and eff icacy profile of  nivolumab 
following a flat dose will be similar to that of 3 mg/kg nivolumab dose.  
Across the various tumor types in the BMS clinical program,  nivolumab has been shown 
to be safe and well tolerated up to a dose level of 10 mg/kg, and the r elationship between 
nivolumab  exposure produced by 3 mg/kg and efficacy has been found to be relatively flat. 
Taken together,  the PK, safety, and efficacy data indicate that the safety and efficacy profile 
of flat nivolumab  dose every 2 weeks will be simil ar to that of a 3 mg/kg nivolumab every 
2 weeks. In this study  after completion of the combination portion of the study, all subjects 
will receive flat dose 480  mg nivolumab every 4 weeks (Q4W), which provides a more 
convenient dosing regimen for  subjects.  Based on PK modeling and simulations, 
administration of nivolumab 480 mg Q4W will  be started after steady state is achieved 
with the combination regimen. While 480 mg Q4W is  predicted to provide greater 
(approximately 20%) maximum steady state concentrati ons and  lower (approximately 
10%) steady state trough concentrations, these exposures are predicted to  be within the 
exposure ranges observed at doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W used in the Phase [ADDRESS_623606] similar 
efficacy and  safety profiles to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W.  
Hence, doubling the dose of nivolumab from [ADDRESS_623607] Ca ses of  
Progressive Disease  
Accumulating clinical evidence indicates some subjects treated with immune system 
stimulating  agents may develop progression of disease (by [CONTACT_121021]) 
before  demonstrating clinical objective responses and/or stable disease. This phenomenon 
was observed  in approximately 10% of subjects in the Phase [ADDRESS_623608] 1.1 defined progression if they are assessed to  be deriving clinical benefit 
and tolerating study drug.  
  
1.4 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment  
There continues to be a significant unmet  need for patients with previously untreated,  
unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma.  
Nivolumab monotherapy has demonstrated clinical activity across several tumor types, 
including  advanced prior treated melanoma, with objective response rates of 20 - 41% in 
[ADDRESS_623609] common AEs included fatigue, rash, 
pruritis, diarrhea, and  nausea.  
 
 38 The combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485300]. Preliminary 
analysis of the  evaluable CA209004 subjects revealed that approximately 33% of the 
subjects had >80% tumor  reductions in target lesions by w eek 12. This compares favorably 
to < 2% for 3 mg/kg  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485301]184020 (N=540) and <3% 
for nivolumab  monotherapy based on the CA209003. However, the combination of 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485302]. The most common (reported at  > 10% incidence) treatment related AEs are fatigue, 
rash, pruritus, diarrhea, lipase increased,  pyrexia, ALT increase, AST increased, amylase 
increased and vitiligo. Although the preliminary  data suggests an increase in adverse event 
frequency of nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485303], there were no unexpected  adverse events noted in the 
combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. In addition, ma ny of the  Grade [ADDRESS_623610] common type of primary malignant melanoma in the body.  It represents 
five to six percent of all melanoma diagnoses.  The incidence of uveal melanoma in the  
world is approximately 4,800 persons per year with nearly 2,000 cases diagnosed in North 
America annually.  Metastasis is via vascular spread, and approximately 40 -50% of 
patients with uveal melanoma will ultimately develop distant disease.  The liver is involved 
in up to 95% of individuals who develop metastatic disease.  The clinical course of patients 
with uveal melanoma is determined by [CONTACT_485369].  Once 
metastatic disease is identified, the median survival of patients with  liver metastases is six 
 
 39 to seven months, despi[INVESTIGATOR_116175], with a dismal one -year survival of approximately 10 -
15%.25, 26, [ADDRESS_623611] in 
cutaneous melanoma but their relevance in mela nomas of rare subtypes, including uveal 
melanoma, remains unstudied in a prospective fashion.  Anecdotal reports from expanded 
access programs and case reports of uveal melanoma patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485304] 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg  demonstrate mode st clinical activity at best with responses no 
more than 6% , CA184 -[ADDRESS_623612] prospective ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485305].  After enrollment of 20 patients however, no 
documented responses were noted at both  3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg.   
 
Because of rationale behind combination checkpoint blockade inhibition and the notable 
clinical activity in cutaneous melanoma with a 1 -year overall survival approaching that of 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (69% 1 -year OS presented by [CONTACT_485370]. ASCO 2014), it is possible 
that monotherapy checkpoint blockade may not be enough to overcome tumor progression 
in uveal melanoma  and that combination immunotherapy is in fact the necessary approach .  
Indeed , reports of small series of uveal melano ma patients on monotherapy anti-PD-[ADDRESS_623613] failed to demonstrate any responses (nivolumab, MK -3475) .   
Combination checkpoint blockade with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485306] a prospective fashion for metsatatic uveal 
melanoma patients.   
The overall risk -benefit ratio for patients entering this protocol is therefore at least 
comparable to and possibly better than alternative options , specifically for uveal 
melanoma, where no standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35734].  Therefore, this protocol is at least 
comparable to the consensus recommendations for this population to enroll on some form 
of a clinical trial.  
1.6 Study Rationale  
Metastatic uveal melanoma is uniformly fatal and median overall survival with current 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_485307] (6 months) with 10 -15% of patients surviving at one year.  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485308] . Anti PD -[ADDRESS_623614] one  measureable lesion will be treated 
with nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485309].

Section 4.  If all criteria are met, the patient will sign consent and be reg istered into the 
central database, Clinical Oncology Research System (CORe).   
3.2 Study Schema  
This is a Phase II study of nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485310].

 42 3.3 Treatment  
Nivolumab is to be administered as a 60 -minute IV infusion, using  a volumetric pump 
with a 0.2/0.22 micron in -line filter at the protocol -specified dose. The drug  can be 
diluted with 0.9% normal saline for delivery but the total drug concentration of the  
solution cannot be below 0.35 mg/ml. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus  
injection. At the end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal 
saline.  
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_186704] a 90 -minute IV infusion, using a  volumetric pump with 
a 0.2 to 1.2 micron in -line filter at the p rotocol -specified dose. The drug  can be diluted with 
0.9% normal saline or 5% Dextrose Injection to concentrations between  1 mg/mL and 4 
mg/mL. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. Care must  be taken to 
assure sterility of the pre pared solutions, since the drug product does not contain any  
antimicrobial preservatives or bacteriostatic agents. At the end of the infusion, flush the 
line with  a sufficient quantity of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution.  
 
When both study drugs are to  be administered on the same day, separate infusion bags and 
filters  must be used for each infusion. Nivolumab is to be administered first. The nivolumab 
infusion  must be promptly followed by a saline flush to clear the line of nivolumab before 
starting th e ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182].  
 
Baseline weight will be used to calculate all induction doses unless weight varies by +/ - 
10% from baseline.  In that case, actual weight will be used.  
  
3.2.1.a Induction Phase  
During the induction phase, patients will be treated with nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg  (+/- 7 days) for a total of four doses (w eek 1, 4, 7, 10) .  The ind uction 
phase continues through w eek 12.  
During the induction phase, patients w ill also have a mandatory biops y of tumor tissue for 
exploratory immune biomarker studies. This biopsy can occur any time after cycle 1 until 
the end of cycle 4 (weeks 4 -12). 
3.2.1.b Maintenance Phase  
For patients who have not experienced disease progression , or un manageable  toxicity by 
[CONTACT_5875] 12, a maintenance phase will begin.   Maintenance treatment consists of nivolumab 
 
 43 monotherapy 480 mg/ every [ADDRESS_623615] the option to 
undergo an additional biopsy of tumor tissue for exploratory biomarker studies.  
 
3.2.1.c General Treatment I nstructions  
 As durable disease stabilization and/or objective tumor response can be seen after 
early progression before w eek 12, it is recommended that, in the absence of 
dose-limiting toxicities (eg, serious immune -mediated adverse reactions ), all four 
doses of nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485311] [ADDRESS_623616]’s performance 
status remains stable.  
 All metastatic subjects who enter the induction  period, including those who may 
have discontinued treatment for drug -related AEs and/or who have evidence of 
clinical progression during the induction  period, should obtain a 12 -week tumor 
assessment.  
 Based on clinical experience in the ongoing and completed melanoma studies, the 
following recommendations apply for subj ect management in light of the w eek 12 
or later tumor assessments:  
 The appearance of new lesions in subjects with other stable or shrinking 
baseline tumor burden may be experiencing clinical benefit and should continue 
in follow -up and/or maintenance therapy before alternative anti -cancer agents 
are considered. These subjects can be seen to have continued tumor shrinkage 
in follow -up scans.  
 As long as overall tumor burden is stable or decreasing, subjects should remain 
in follow -up and/or maintenance (see below), even in the presence  of new 
lesions.  
 Clinical progression warranting alternative anti -cancer treatment should be 
considered only in subjects whose overall tumor burden appears to be 
substantially increased and/or in subjects whose performance status is 
decreased.  
 
3.4 Follow -up (duration of study)  
 Subjects who are  no longer receiving treatment  and are removed from the study 
because of unacceptable toxicity (refractory Grade  > 3 immune -mediated adverse 
reactions ) or due to investigator or  his designee judgment are manage d in 
follow -up. Efficacy assessments for these subjects during follow -up are as per the 
standard of care. Date of death is recorded.  
 Subjects who discontinue treatments should  be followed until death or the closure 
of the study (whichever is first).  
 
 44  Subjec ts who are no longer receiving treatment  because of clinical progression or 
who have switched to alternative treatment are not followed formally except to 
record the date of death.  
 All subjects who come off study for any reason will be followed for at leas t 60 days, 
which is equal to 4 half –lives of the  longest  drug.

10. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and fertile men with partners of 
childbearing potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid 
pregnancy throughout the study  and for up to  [ADDRESS_623624] dose of 
investigational produc t, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.   
WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not 
undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, 
or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not po st-menopausal. Post -menopause is defined 
as: 
 Amenorrhea  12 consecutive months without another cause, or  
 For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking  hormone replacement 
therapy (HRT) , a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
 35 mIU/mL.  
Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal 
products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products 
such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, 
spermici des) to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their 
partner is sterile ( e.g., vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing  
potential.  
WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 
25 IU/L or equiv alent units of βHCG) within  [ADDRESS_623625] be using an adequate method of contraception to 
avoid c onception throughout the study ( and for up to [ADDRESS_623626] dose

minimized.  
Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the 
course of the study, in a manner such that the risk of failure is minimized.  Before 
enrolling women of childbearing  potential in this clinical trial, investigators must 
review the guideline about study participation for WOCBP, which can be found in 
the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Manual for investigators. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_485313]:  
 
 general information  
 informed  consent form  
 pregnancy prevention information sheet  
 drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives  
 contraceptives in current use  
 guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy  
Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avo iding 
pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an 
unintentional pregnancy.  This discussion will be documented on the informed 
consent form required for study participation.   
In addition, all WOCBP or fertile men with partners of childbearing potential 
should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_485371] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time 
during st udy participation. If following initiation of study treatment, it is 
subsequently discovered that a trial patient is pregnant or may have been pregnant 
at the time of exposure to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], including during at least [ADDRESS_623627] be 
performed on the patient unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x -ray studies). 
Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if 
indicated. In add ition, the investigator must report to Bristol -Myers Squibb 
follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal 
and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed for a minimum of 8 weeks.

4.3 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) will monitor the progress of all clinical 
investigations being conducted under its IND and remain compliant under 
21CFR312.56(b ).  The clinical research monitor, who has not had a prior role in the conduct 
of the study, will be assigned  to monitor  the study and will discuss the frequency  of the 
chart review with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_485315].  For all s tudies, eligibility and informed 
consent documentation will be reviewed following enrollment of selected subjects .  With 
the exception of eligibility and informed consent review, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_485316]  [ADDRESS_623630] the s tandards for optimal data as delineated 
in the research protocol.  Investigator compliance with regulatory requirements and 
guidelines  for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) will be assessed.  
The clinical research monitor will complete a written monitoring repor t following each 
monitoring visit.  The report will include a summary of what the monitor reviewed, any 
significant findings , identified actions taken or to be taken by [CONTACT_5051], and/or 
actions recommended securing compliance.  Emphasis will be pl aced on clear and 
complete reporting of the findings.  Comments will be made regarding problems or 
concerns affecting the validity or accuracy of the data.   
The final report will be submitted to the MDACC IND Medical Monitor for review.  The 
original sign ed report will be kept in the IND folder within the IND Office.  A follow -up 
letter identifying unresolved issues will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_485317].  
In order to remain compliant with 21CFR312.56(b) any trial that is being conducte d under 
an MDACC -sponsored IND and is discontinued due to investigator noncompliance will 
have official notification set to the FDA.   
 
 49 5 STUDY THERAPY  
5.1 Nivolumab (BMS 936558)  
Nivolumab (BMS -936558) vials must be stored at a temperature of 2or for review.  The

stored in  the carton. Recommended safety measures for preparation and handling of 
nivolumab include  laboratory coats and gloves.  
Nivolumab Injection, 100 mg/10  mL (10 mg/mL) and 40 mg/4 mL (10 mg/mL)  
Vials of nivolumab injection must be stored at 2 °-8°C (36 °-46°F) and protected from 
light,  freezing, and shaking.   
 
Undiluted Nivolumab Injection and Diluted Nivolumab Injection in the IV Bag  
The administration of nivolumab infusion must be completed within 24 hours of 
preparation. If  not used immediately, the infusion solution may be stored under 
refrigeration conditions  (2°-8°C, 36° -46°F) for up to 24 hours, and a maximum of 4 hours 
of the total 24 hours can be at  room temperature (20 °-25°C, 68 °-77°F) and room light. 
The maximum [ADDRESS_623631] been observed.Nivolumab is to be 
administered  before ipi[INVESTIGATOR_188] a 60 -minute IV infusion, using a  volumetric pump with  
a 0.2/0.22 micron in -line filter at the protocol -specified dose. The drug  can be diluted with 
0.9% normal saline for delivery but the total drug concentration of the  solution cannot be 
below 0.35 mg/ml. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus . 
When the combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485318], separate infusion bags and filters must be used for each infusion. Nivolumab is to be 
administered first. The second infusion will always be ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485319] 30 minutes after completion of the nivolumab infusion. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485320] 0.9% Sodium Chloride Solution or 5% Dextrose solution. Nivolumab may be 
diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Solution.  
The dosing calculations should be based o n body weight. If the subject’s weight on the day 
of dosing differs by > 10% from the weight used to calculate the dose, the dose must be 
recalculated. All doses should be rounded up to the nearest milligram per institutional 
standard. There will be no dos e modifications allowed.

mg/mL. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. Care must  be taken to 
assure sterility of the prepared solutions, since the drug product does not contain any  
antimicrobial preservatives or bacteriostatic agents. At the end  of the infusion, flush the 
line with  a sufficient quantity of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution.  
When both study drugs are to be administered on the same day, separate infusion bags and 
filters  must be used for each infusion. Nivolumab is to be administered first. The nivolumab 
infusion  must be promptly followed by a saline flush to clear the line of nivolumab before 
starting th e ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182].

5.2.5 Immune -Related Adverse  Events ( irAEs )Reactions  and Immune -
mediated Adverse Reactions : Definition, Monitoring, and Treatment  
Blocking CTLA -4 and PD -1 function may permit the emergence of auto -reactive T  cells 
and resultant clinical autoimmunity. Rash/vitiligo, diarrhea/colitis, uveitis/epi[INVESTIGATOR_227], 
hepatitis , and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_228] -related, presumptive autoimmune events, now 
termed immune -media ted adverse reactions , noted in previous ipi[INVESTIGATOR_229].  
For the purposes of this study, an immune -related adverse reaction is defined as an adverse 
reaction  of unknown etiology associated with drug exposure and consistent with an 
immune phenomenon. Ef forts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, 
toxin or other etiologic causes prior to labeling an event an immune -related adverse 
reactions . Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data should be used to support 
the diagnosis  of an immune -related toxicity. Suspected immune -related adverse reactions 
must be documented on an AE or SAE form. Another term for an irAE is an immune -
mediate adverse reaction, as it is termed in the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_277]. 
Both terms may  be used in this protocol document.  
Patients should be informed of and carefully monitored for evidence of clinically 
significant systemic immune -mediated adverse reactions (e.g., systemic lupus 
erythematosus -like diseases) or organ -specific immune -mediated adverse reaction  (e.g., 
rash, colitis, uveitis, hepatitis or thyroid disease). If an immune -mediated adverse reaction  
is noted, appropriate work -up (including biopsy if possible) should be performed, and 
steroid therapy may be considered if  clinically necessary .   
It is unknown if systemic corticosteroid therapy has an attenuating effect on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485328]. However, clinical anti -tumor responses have been maintained in patients treated 
with corticosteroids and discontinued from ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b. If utilized, corticosteroid therapy 
 
 56 should be individualized for each patient. Prior experience suggests that colitis manifested 
as ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_623648] with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritis,  
arthralgias, hypo - or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 
infusion  reactions should b e reported within 24 hours to the BMS Medical Monitor and 
reported as an  SAE if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded according to 
NCI CTCAE  (version 4.0) guidelines.  
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on  local 
treatment  standards and guidelines as appropriate:  
For mild symptoms , Grade 1 (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; 
intervention not  indicated)  Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from 
symptoms. The following  prophyla ctic premedications are recommended for future 
infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg  (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen) at least 30 minutes before  additional nivolumab administrations. For 
moderate symptoms , Grade 2   
 (Moderate reac tion requires therapy or infusion interruption but  responds promptly to 
symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non -steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic  medications 
indicated for < 24 hours).  Stop the nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182], begin an IV 
infusion of normal saline, and treat the  subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or 
equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325  to 1000 mg  (acetaminophen); remain at bedside 
and monitor subject until reso lution of symptoms.  Corticosteroid or bronchodilator 
therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion  is interrupted, then 
restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms  resolve; if no 
further complications ensue af ter 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of  the 
original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur then no further 
nivolumab  or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_114569]. Administer 
diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_623649] be recorded on the 
electronic case report form (eCRF). The following  prophylactic premedications are 
recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg  (or equivalent) and/or 
paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered at  least 30 
 
 57 minutes before additional nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45782]. If necessary,  
corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or eq uivalent) 
may be  used.  
For severe symptoms , Grade 3 or Grade 4   
(Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_485329]/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of  symptoms following 
initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_485330]  [eg, renal 
impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life -threatening; pressor or ventilator 
support indicated).   
 Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Begin an IV infusion 
of norma l saline, and treat the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators,  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of  a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 
0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution  injected slowly for IV administration, and/or 
diphenhydramine 50 m g IV with  methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as 
needed. Subject should be monitored until the  investigator is comfortable that the 
symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485331]. 
Investigators should follow the ir institutional guidelines for the  treatment of 
anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms.  In 
the case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or  
generalized pruritis within 1 week a fter treatment), symptomatic treatment may be 
given  (eg, oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
5.2.6.a Treatment of  Nivolumab or  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -Related Isolated Drug Fever  
In the event of isolated drug fever, the investigator  must use clinical judgment to determine 
if the fever is related to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_241].  If a patient experiences 
isolated drug fever, for the next dose, pre -treatment with acetaminophen or non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory agent ( investigator  discretion) should be institute d and a repeated 
antipyretic dose at [ADDRESS_623650] dosing with an appropriate 
antipyretic, the infusion rate for subsequent dosing should be decreased to 50% of the 
previous rate. If fever recurs following infusion rate change, the investigator  should assess 
the patient’s level of discomfort with the event and use clinical judgment to determine if 
the patient should receive further ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
5.2.6.b Monitoring and Management of Immune -mediated Adverse 
Reactions  
Refer to Appendix B for algorithms recommended for utilization in CA18 4-187. 
 
 [ADDRESS_623651] (LFT) Assessments Required Before  
Administration of Nivolumab or Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485332] (AST, ALT, T. bilirubin) will be evaluated for every subject prior to 
administration of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Blood samples must be collected and analyzed 
at local or central labs within [ADDRESS_623652] be r eviewed by [CONTACT_28824] (or designee) to meet dosing criteria specifications:  2.[ADDRESS_623653], ALT and  [ADDRESS_623654] for T. bilirubin unless liver metastases are present in which case 
LFT  [ADDRESS_623655], ALT and T. bilirubin  3.[ADDRESS_623656]) p rior to dosing.   
If, during the course of treatment abnormal LFT values are detected, the subject must be 
managed using the hepatotoxicity algorithm section in Appendix B. 
5.3 Prohibited and Restricted Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_239981]  
5.3.1 Prohibited Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_485333] a component of the protocol regimen (including those for 
common medical conditions) for up to one month pre and post dosing with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] . 
Concomitant systemic or local anti -cancer medications or treatments are prohibited in this 
study while receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_225].   
Patients may not use any of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_226]:

 [ADDRESS_623658] a window of +/ - [ADDRESS_623659] will be every 4 weeks during Maintenance phase (every other visit).  
 
 
 
 
 61 6.2 Procedures by [CONTACT_485374].  
6.2.1 Study Procedures by [CONTACT_485375] (that is, all chemistry and all hematology 
results) must be obtained and reviewed by [CONTACT_485376][INVESTIGATOR_288] .  All induc tion period laboratory samples must be collected 
within a window of up to 7  days before administration of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The 
order set for infusion will require labs to be verified prior to administration.  Hold and 
notify MD parameters will be g iven on the order set.   
6.2.1.a  Screening/Baseline Visit  
Eligible patients will have a screening/baseline visit that may, in some instances, occur 
simultaneously with Treatment Visit 1.  During this visit, the patient will have: a review of 
his/her medical history; physical examination including vital signs; assessment of signs, 
symptoms,  concomitant medications, and adverse events; a review of common laboratory 
tests (CBC with differential, basic metabolic panel), a pregnancy test  (within [ADDRESS_623660] dose)  if applicable, liver function test (AST, ALT, T. bilirubin), and thyroid function 
test (TSH, free T4).  In addition, study personnel will review inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
tumor assessments, and review and sign the informed consent documen t with the patient.  
All screening evaluations with the exception of pregnancy test should be completed within 
28 days (+/ - 7 days) of start of protocol treatment.  
6.2.1.b Treatment Visits  
At each treatment visit  during the induction phase , the patient will  have a physical 
examination including vital signs, assessment of signs, symptoms, and adverse events, 
review of laboratory data  and a concomitant medication assessment. If the Baseline Visit 
occurs within [ADDRESS_623661] mandatory  biopsy of tumor tissue for 
exploratory studies. This biopsy can occur any time after cycle 1 until the end of cycle 4 
(weeks 4 -12). 
During the maintenance phase and at the end of study, patients hav e the option to undergo 
an additional biopsy of tumor tissue for exploratory biomarker studies.  
6.2.3 Exploratory Correlative Studies  
Tissues collected for exploratory correlates may be analyzed for immunological features 
using platforms included, but no l imited to immunohistochemistry (IHC) for T cells (CD3, 
CD4, CD8, CD68). Molecular analytes (e.g. DNA, m RNA, protein) may be extracted as 
available tissue allows and characterized  using a variety of analytic platforms, or the most 
efficacious method for a particular analyte at the time of analysis including whole 
transcriptomic profiling, RNASeg, Nanostring, Reverse Phase Protein Array, and next 
generation sequencing.  
6.2.4 Study Completion or Early Discontinuation Visit  
At the time of study early withdrawal, the reason for early withdrawal and any new or 
continuing adverse events  should be documented.  A concomitant medication assessment 
will also be performed.  
6.2.5 Study Drug Discontinuation  
If study drug administration is discontinued, the reason for discontinuation will be 
recorded.  
6.3 Details of Procedures  
6.3.1 Study Materials  
Bristol -Myers Squibb  (BMS) will provide nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485335] . 
6.3.[ADDRESS_623662], up to and including follow -up visits, will be reported. See Section 8: Adverse 
Event Reporting.  
 
 
 63 6.4 Criteria for Evaluation  
6.4.1 Safety Evaluation  
Safety will be evaluated for all treated patients using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov). Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse 
event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, physical examinations, and 
clinical laboratory tests.  
6.4.2 Efficacy Evaluation  
All efficacy evaluations will be conducted by [CONTACT_485377] (WHO). All subject’s 
results will documented in the subject’s eCRF.  
6.4.2 .a Definition of Measurable and Non -Measurable Lesions  
 Measurable Lesions  are lesions that can be accurately measured in two perpendicular 
diameters, with at least one diameter ≥ 20 mm and the other dimension ≥ 10 mm ([ADDRESS_623663]). The area will be defined as the product of the largest 
diameter with its perpendi cular. Skin lesions can be considered measurable.  
 Non-Measurable (evaluable) Lesions  are all other lesions, including 
unidimensionally measurable disease and small lesions (lesions without at least one 
diameter ≥ 20 mm), and any of the following:  
 Lesions o ccurring in a previously irradiated area (unless they are documented as 
new lesions since the completion of radiation therapy), bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses th at are not pathologically/cytologically 
confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_79377].  
 All measurable and non -measurable lesions should be measured at screening and 
at the defined tumor assessment timepoints  (see Section 5 , Table  2). Extra 
assessments may be performed , as clinically indicated,  if there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_485336].  
6.4.2.b Definition of Index/Non -Index Lesions  
All measurable lesions, up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and ten lesions in 
total, should be identif ied as index  lesions to be measured and recorded on the medical 
record  at Screening. The index  lesions should be representative of all involved organs. In 
addition, index  lesions should be selected based on their size (lesions with the longest 
diameters), their suitability for accurate repeat assessment by [CONTACT_15218], and how 
 
 
 64 representative they are of the patient’s tumor burden. At Screening, a sum of the products 
of diameters  (SPD) for all index  lesions will be calculated and considered the baseli ne sum 
of the products of diameters. Response criteria to be followed are listed b elow . The baseline 
sum will be used as the reference point to determine the objective tumor response of the 
index lesions at tumor assessment ( TA). 
Measurable lesions, other than index  lesions, and all sites of non -measurable disease, will 
be identified as non-index  lesions. Non-index  lesions will be recorded on the medical record  
and should be evaluated at the same assessment time points as the index  lesions. In 
subsequent assessments, non-index  lesions will be recorded as “stable or decreased 
disease ,” “absent ,” or “progression .” 
6.4.3 Definition of Tumor Response Using irRC  
The sum of the products of diameters at tumor assessment using the immune -related 
response criteria (irRC) for progressive disease incorporates the contribution of new 
measurable lesions. Each net Percentage Change in Tumor Burden per assessment using 
irRC criteria accounts for the size and g rowth kinetics of both old and new lesions as they 
appear.  
6.4.3.a Definition of Index Lesions Response Using irRC  
 irComplete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all index lesions. This 
category encompasses exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_941] m WHO criteria.  
 irPartial Response (irPR):  Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum 
of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index and all new 
measurable lesions (ie., Percentage Change in Tumor Burden). Note: the appearance of 
new measurable lesions is factored into the overall tumor burden, but does not 
automatically qualify as progressive disease until the SPD increases by ≥25% whe n 
compared to SPD at nadir.  
 irStable Disease (irSD):  Does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence of 
progressive disease.  
 irProgressive Disease (irPD):  At least 25% increase Percentage Change in Tumor 
Burden (i.e., taking sum of the products of all index lesions and any new lesions) when 
compared to SPD at nadir.  
6.4.3.b Definition of Non -Index Lesions Response Using irRC  
 irComplete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all non-index lesions. This 
category encompasses exactly the same subjec ts as “CR” by [CONTACT_270336].  
 irPartial Response (irPR) or irStable Disease (irSD):  non-index lesion(s) are not 
considered in the definition of PR, these terms do not apply.  
 
 
 65  irProgressive Disease (irPD):  Increases in number or size of non-index lesion(s ) does 
not constitute progressive disease unless/until the Percentage Change in Tumor Burden 
increases by 25% (i.e., the SPD at nadir of the index lesions increases by [CONTACT_453105]).  
6.4.3.c Impact of New Lesions on irRC  
New lesions in and  by [CONTACT_242840]. However their 
contribution to total tumor burden is included in the SPD which in turn feeds into the irRC 
criteria for tumor response. Therefore, new non -measurable lesions will not discontinue 
any subject from the study.  
6.4.3.d Definition of Overall Response Using irRC  
Overall response using irRC will be based on these criteria:  
 Immune -Related Complete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all tumor 
lesions (index and nonindex together with no new mea surable/unmeasurable lesions) 
for at least 4 weeks from the date of documentation of complete response.  
 Immune -Related Partial Response (irPR):  The sum of the products of the two largest 
perpendicular diameters of all index lesions is measured and capture d as the SPD 
baseline. At each subsequent tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the two 
largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions and of new measurable lesions are 
added together to provide the Immune Response Sum of Product Diameters (ir SPD). 
A decrease, relative to baseline of the irSPD compared to the previous SPD baseline, 
of 50% or greater is considered an immune Partial Response (irPR).  
 Immune -Related Stable Disease (irSD):  irSD is defined as the failure to meet criteria 
for immune complete response or immune partial response, in the absence of 
progressive disease.  
 Immune -Related Progressive Disease (irPD):  It is recommended in difficult cases to 
confirm PD by [CONTACT_242841]. Any of the following will constitute progressive disease:  
 At least 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index lesions over baseline 
SPD calculated for the index lesions.  
 At least a 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index lesions and new 
measurable lesions (irSPD) over the baseline SPD calc ulated for the index lesions.

6.4.3.e Immune -Related Best Overall Response Using irRC (irBOR)  
irBOR is the best confirmed irRC overall response over the study as a whole, recorded 
between the date of first dose until the last tumor assessment before subsequent therapy 
(except for local palliative radiotherapy for painful bone lesions) for the individual subject 
in the study. For the assessment of irBOR, all available assessments per subject are 
considered.  
irCR or irPR determinations included in the irBOR assess ment must be confirmed by a 
second (confirmatory) evaluation meeting the criteria for response and performed no less 
than [ADDRESS_623664], abdomen and pelvis is required a t screening 
(ie, baseline) and at each tumor assessment visit, regardless of the location of known 
metastases. Refer to Section 6.[ADDRESS_623665], abdomen and pelvis is required at baseline  and at Week  24 (+/ - 7 
days) and every 6 months thereafter (+/ - 7 days) until removal from or completion of study.

 [ADDRESS_623678] and entered into PDMS/CORe 
accordi ng to the following guidelines…  
An Adverse Event  (AE)  is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening 
of a pre -existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of investig ational product, whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product.  Any Adverse Events considered common 
for this disease process (uveal melanoma, metastatic uveal melanoma) or related to disease 
will be captured at the discretion of the att ending MD.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or m ore AEs.)  
8.1.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious AE (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:   
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the abili ty to conduct 
normal life functions.  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 
 
 72 Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatm ent in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
(21 CFR 312.32).  
 Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered ser ious adverse 
events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_195696], IND Office.  
 All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of  a SAE 
must be reported to the IRB and BMS in accordance with the timeframes and procedures 
outlined in “ The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review 
Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and 
Devices ”. Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must 
be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of 
knowledge of the event).  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_623679] 
as determined by a physician should be used:  
 Related:  There is a reasonable causal  relationship to investigational product 
administration and the adverse event.  
 Not Related:  There is not a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product 
administration and the adverse event.  
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is me ant to convey in general that there 
are facts (eg, evidence such as de -challenge/re -challenge) or other arguments to suggest a 
positive causal relationship.  
8.3 Collection and Reporting  
 All life -threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the study drug, 
must have a written report submitted within 24 hours  (next working day) of knowledge 
of the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
 Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for 
safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
 
 
 73  Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_623680] returned to baseline, progression of the event has 
stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
 Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after th e [ADDRESS_623681] be reported to the IND Office. This may 
include the development of a secondary malignancy.  
Reporting to FDA:  
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety Proje ct 
Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97102], Good Clinical 
Practices, the protocol guidelines, the s ponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review 
Board policy.  
Investigator Communication with Supporting Companies:  
All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a 
SAE must be reported to the IRB and BMS in accordance with the timeframes and 
procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center 
Institutional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated 
Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”.   Unless stated otherwise in the proto col, all 
SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of 
attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_623682]’s written consent to participate in the study, all S AEs must be 
collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. All 
SAEs must  be collected that occur within [ADDRESS_623683] be collected that relate to any later 
protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy). The investigator should notify 
BMS of any SAE occurring after this time period that is believed to be related to the 
investigational product or protocol -specified procedure.  
All SAEs whether related or unrelated to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], must be immediately reported to 
BMS (by [CONTACT_1719]) within [ADDRESS_623684] be kept on file at the study site.  
All SAEs should be faxed or emailed to BMS at:  
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_485342] -Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number:  [PHONE_188]  
Email: [EMAIL_178]  
For studies conducted under an Investigator IND , any event that is both serious and 
unexpected must be reported to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 7 
days (death or life -threatening event) or 15 days (all other SAEs) after the investigator’s 
or institution’s initial receipt of the information.  BMS will be provided with a 
simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed with the FDA.  The MDACC “Inter nal SAE 
Report Form for Prompt Reporting” will be used for reporting to the IRB Office and to 
BMS.  
All SAEs should simultaneously be faxed or e -mailed to BMS at:  
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_9611] -Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number:  [PHONE_188]  
Email: [EMAIL_178]  
Serious adverse events, whether related or unrelated to investigational product, must be 
recorded on the SAE page and reported expeditiously to BMS (or designee) to comply with 
regulatory requirements. An SAE report should b e completed for any event where doubt 
exists regarding its status of seriousness .  
All SAEs must be immediately reported by [CONTACT_204188] (fax) and 
mailing of the completed SAE page. In some instances where a facsimile machine is not 
available, overnight express mail may be used. If only limited information is initiall y 
available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up SAE reports should include the 
same investigator term(s) initially reported.) In selected circumstances, the protocol may 
specify conditions that require additional telephone reporting.  
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to the investigational product, but is 
potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy, 
or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specifie d in the narrative 
section of the SAE page.  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to the investigational product, a 
follow -up SAE report should be sent immediately to the sponsor. As follow -up information 
 
 
 75 becomes available it should be  sent immediately using the same procedure used for 
transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization.

8.3.2 Reporting to FDA  
Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Project Manager, 
IND office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
 
 
 76 8.3.3 Handling  of Expedited Safety Reports  
In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify investigators of all SAEs that are 
suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (ie, not previously 
described in the Investigator Brochure). In the Euro pean Union (EU), an event meeting 
these criteria is termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). 
Investigator  notification of these events will be in the form of an expedited safety report 
(ESR).  
  
In addition, suspected serious advers e reactions (whether expected or unexpected) shall be 
reported by [CONTACT_485379] (either as expedited and/or in aggregate reports).  
8.3.[ADDRESS_623685] review the guideline abou t study participation 
for WOCBP which can be found in the GCP Manual for Investigators. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_485343]:  
 General Information  
 Informed Consent Form  
 Pregnancy Prevention Information Sheet  
 Drug Interactions with Hormonal Contraceptives  
 Contra ceptives in Current Use  
 
 
 77  Guidelines for the Follow -up of a Reported Pregnancy . 
Before stu dy enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy during study  participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. T he subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  
All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_623686] be 25 IU/L or equivalent 
units of HCG. If the pregnancy test is positive, the subject must not receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485344].  
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and fertile men with partners of childbearing 
potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy 
throughout the study and for up to [ADDRESS_623687] they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any 
time during study participation.  
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a 
study subject is pregnant or m ay have been pregnant at the time of investigational product 
exposure, including during at least [ADDRESS_623688] will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, 
dose tapering if necessar y for subject safety). The investigator must immediately notify 
BMS of this event and record the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form (not an 
SAE form). Initial information on a pregnancy must be reported immediately to BMS, and 
the outcome informa tion provided once the outcome is known. Completed Pregnancy 
Surveillance Forms must be forwarded to BMS according to SAE reporting procedures.  
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be 
reported to the sponsor. Inf ormation on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.  
Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x -ray studies). Other appropri ate 
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the 
investigator  must report to BMS, and follow -up on information regarding the course of the 
pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed  for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_623689].  
9. Statistical  Methodology  
 
The trial originally used Simon’s two -stage design to target a response rate of 15% vs. a 
historical rate of 5%.  A total of [ADDRESS_623690] been enrolled in 
the second stage.  Given advancements in melanoma treatment, a 15% response rate is no 
longer considered interesting, and in 2017, the study has been changed to a single -stage 
design targeting a response rate of 20%.  A total of [ADDRESS_623691] been 
enrolled at the time of this change.  
 
 
A single -stage trial  design will be employed to enroll patients on the metastatic arm with 
the following a ssumptions:  
 Type I error rate of 5%, power of 80%  
 Null hypothesis of 5% response rate  
 Alternate hypothesis of 20% response rate  
 Response will be defined as those patients who achieve RECIST CR + PR.   
 Accounting for attrition (inevaluable patients, 25%) an d screen fails (5%), up to 39 
patients are needed to achieve a target enrollment of 27 evaluable patients.  
 If at least 4 of the 27 patients are responders, the null hypothesis of a 5% response 
rate will be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  
If the true probability of response if 5%, this design has a 4. 4% chance of incorrectly 
concluding that it is effective . If the true probability of response is 20%, the design has an 
18.2 % chance of incorrectly concluding that it is not effective.  
 
 
 [ADDRESS_623692] 
and a fter exertion and should be performed as noted in Table 10 Notes Baseline signs and 
symptoms are those that are assessed within 14 days prior to randomization. Concomitant 
medications will be collected from within 14 days prior to randomization through the  study 
treatment period.  
 
Baseline local laboratory assessments should be done within 14 days prior to treatment to 
include: CBC w/differential, LFTs (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase), BUN 
or serum urea level, creatinine, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, LDH, glucose, amylase, lipase, TSH, 
Free T4, Free T3, and Hep B and C testing only as clinically indicated  (HBV sAg, HCV 
Ab or HCV RNA). Pregnancy testing for WOCBP (done locally) must be performed within 
[ADDRESS_623693]’s 
status are acceptable.  
 
Adverse events and laboratory values will be graded according to the NCI -CTC AE version 
4.0.  
On-study weight and ECOG Performance status should be assessed on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 
3, 4 and 5 during cycles 1 and 2 (except Cycle 1 Day 1) and Day 1 of Weeks 1, 3 and 5 
starting from Cycle 3 and vital signs should be assessed at each on -study visit (except Cycle 
1 Day 1). Vital signs should also be taken as per institutional standard of care prior to, 
during and after dosing. Oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_485380] -study visit prior to d osing. The start and stop time of the 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_623694] exam, report changes on the ap propriate non -serious or serious adverse event page.  
 
On study local laboratory assessments should be done within 72 hours of dosing to include; 
CBC w/differential, LFTs (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase), BUN or 
serum urea level, creatinine , Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, LDH, glucose, amylase, lipase, TSH with 
Free T4, Free T3 on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13, then every 12 weeks . Additional 
measures including non -study required laboratory tests should be  performed as clinically 
indicated or to com ply with local regulations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
inducted liver enzyme elevations) will be monitored during the follow -up phase via on 
site/local labs until all study drug related toxicities resolve, return to baseline or are deemed 
irreversible.  
 
Oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_485381] a subject has any new or worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]. A reading at rest and on 
exertion should be obtained at each time point. The extent of the exe rtion should be based 
on the judgment of the investigator, but should remain consistent for each individual 
subject throughout the study. If the patient’s subject’s status changes, the investigator can 
alter the extent of exertion based on their medical ju dgment. If a subject shows changes on 
pulse oximetry or other pulmonary related signs (hypoxia, fever) or symptoms (eg, 
dyspnea, cough, fever) consistent with possible pulmonary adverse events, the patient 
subject should be immediately evaluated to rule ou t pulmonary toxicity. An algorithm for 
the management of suspected pulmonary toxicity can be found in the nivolumab 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
Some of the previously referred to assessments may not be captured as data in the eCRF. 
They are intended to be us ed as safety monitoring by [CONTACT_1963]. Additional 
testing or assessments may be performed as clinically necessary or where required by 
[CONTACT_53933].    
 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_623695], abdomen, 
and pelvis, and all known sites  of disease and should use the same imaging method as was 
used at baseline. Subjects will be  evaluated for tumor response beginning 12 weeks ( +/ 1 
week) from randomization and conti nuing  every 6 weeks ( + 1 week) for the first 12 months 
from randomization and every 12 weeks  (+/ 1 week) thereafter, until disease progression 
is documented or treatment is discontinued  (whichever occurs later). Tumor assessments 
for ongoing study treatmen t decisions will be  completed by [CONTACT_26309] 
(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)  1.[ADDRESS_623696] be conducted as described in the final approved protocol.  Documentation 
of approval signed by [CONTACT_485382](s) must be sent to  your BMS  
protocol manager .  
All revisions (protocol amendments, administrative letters, and changes to the informed 
consent) must be submitted to  your BMS  protocol manager . The investigator  should not 
implement an y deviation or change to the protocol without prior review and documented 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_195705], except where necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study patients.  
See also 21CFR for definitions of amendment and  requirements.  
 
 
 [ADDRESS_623697] important 
consid erations and should prevail over interests of science and society.  
 10.3 Records and Reports  
Case histories will be collected and recorded on all study patients and all data will be 
entered in the computerized Protocol Data Management System (PDMS) of the Division 
of Medicine at MD Anderson Cancer Center.  Patients must be registered in PDMS before 
a cycle of therapy can be given.  A brief explanation for required but missing data should 
be recorded as a comment.  The investigator is required to retain, in a confidential manner, 
the data pertinent to the study for the duration of the study or the maximum period required 
by [CONTACT_485383].  If the investigator 
withdraws from the study (eg, relocation, retirem ent), the records shall be transferred to a 
mutually agreed upon designee (eg, another investigator or IRB).  Documentation of such 
transfer must be provided to BMS.  
 10.4 Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical  Practice (GCP), as defined 
by [CONTACT_8639]  (ICH) and in accordance with the ethical 
principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the [LOCATION_002] Code 
of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50).  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any 
amendments and the subject informed consent will receive Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_485345] t he study.  
 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_623698] be reported to BMS and to the IND Sponsor -MD 
Anderson Cancer Center (Office of Research Education and Regulatory Management) 
immediately. A serious breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in  
connection with the study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, 
the safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the study or the scientific 
value of the study.  
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, 
and experience to perform their respective task(s).  This study will not use the services of 
study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been scientific 
misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medi cal licensure, debarment).  
Systems with procedures that ensure the quality of every aspect of the study will be 
implemented.  
 10.[ADDRESS_623699]/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IRB/IEC)  
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment 
materials/process (eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be provided t o 
subjects. The investigator should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigator 
Brochure or product labeling, information to be provided to subjects and any updates.  
The investigator should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other information 
(eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures  
10.[ADDRESS_623700] all observations and other data pertinent to the 
investigation (e.g. medical record ) for the maximum period required by [CONTACT_12723], or Institution procedures.  
 
If the investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records shall 
be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another investigator, IRB). 
Documentation of such transfer must be provided to BMS.  
 
 
 84 APPENDIX A: MANAGEMENT ALGORIT HMS  
These  general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be  
supplemented by [CONTACT_485384]. The guidance applies to all immuno -oncology agents and regimens.  
 
A general principle is that differential  diagnoses should be diligently evaluated  
according to standard medical practice. Non -inflammatory etiologies should be  
considered and appropriately treated.  
 
Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno -oncology drug -related  
adverse events. The oral e quivalent of the recommended IV doses may be  
considered for ambulatory patients with low -grade toxicity. The lower  
bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account when  
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.  
 
Consulta tion with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive  
diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, is recommended.

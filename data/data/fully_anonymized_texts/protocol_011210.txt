with multiple sclerosis  (MS) (S15-[ZIP_CODE])
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_83000]: November 20, [ADDRESS_90527] current  
stimulation (tDCS) combined with a cognitive training program, remotely-delivered using  a telemedicine  
protocol in n=85 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) and  in n=30  adults with Parkinson’s Disease. Overall, 
the enrollment goal for  this study shall be n=115.  The objective of this study  is to establish  a study  
protocol to use in clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of tDCS to ameliorate  two of the most debilitating 
symptoms of MS that remain without effective treatment: cognitive  impairment and fatigue.
We developed the protocol to be used  for this study at our former institution, Stony Brook Medicine,  and 
have published the results1. As described below, it has been tested  in n=20 adults with MS with over 192  
active sessions. The tDCS administered  in our protocol has been very well-tolerated (all sessions  
successfully completed, no side effects reported to be more  than moderate  level).
II. BACKGROUND
MS is a common disorder  associated with major costs.  MS is characterized by [CONTACT_83023],  
immune-mediated inflammation,  and neurodegeneration within the central  nervous  system2, 3. The most  
common subtype is relapsing-remitting and over  half of these individuals  transition to a progressive  
course; the remainder have a progressive course from the onset4. MS is the most common progressive  
neurologic disorder in adults of working-ag e5. It is estimated  to affect  more than  2.3 million people 
worldwide including over 400,000 individuals in the US costing  up to ~$52,[ADDRESS_90528]  used electrode  montages that  produce  some current  flow  across the frontal lobe 
(including any montage with  a supra-orbital “return”). A broad neuromodulation of the frontal pole may 
be consistent with  a general mechanism  of action for its activating effects, along  with a general increase   
in large-scale network connectivity12.
tDCS produces  current  intensities in the brain orders of magnitude below other stimulation  techniques  
such as transcranial  magnetic stimulation  (TMS)  or electroconvulsive  therapy (ECT) 13; tDCS  has none of 
the significant side-effects reported  with  these much more  intensive interventions.  Many subjects feel 
nothing or only mild  sensation during the main course of tDCS. Across studies, the most common side  
effect reported from  this technique  is a mild  tingling sensation 8, 14.
Though various  non-invasive  neuromodulation  technologies are available (e.g.,  transcranial  magnetic 
stimulation), tDCS has many advantages  compared to other stimulation  methods  including ease  of use,  
lower cost,  and better tolerability (e.g., it has not been associated  with development  of seizures15, 16). 
With an extensive  record of safety  and tolerability, the most common side effects  are specific to the
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_82998]-delivered (tDCS) combined  with  cognitive  training  in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) (S15-[ZIP_CODE])

11/20/2017electrode site and include itching, tingling, and burning17. Initial  studies have  found tDCS to be effective  
in a variety  of uses in healthy participants as well as in a range of clinical conditions18,8, 19, 20,21, 22 and may 
be preferred to drug treatment in special populations (such as pregnant women18) due to its safety  
advantages .
tDCS is considered  especially  promising for symptomatic treatment  in MS both  for its tolerability, 
deployability (based on our innovative  remotely-supervised approach), and presumed  
mechanism of action . While  there is emerging study  the cellular mechanisms of tDCS23, what is 
established is that sustained (minutes) of tDCS can produce lasting changes in brain excitability24 and 
that these changes are plastic and cumulative  with  repeated  sessions 25. One  of the largest and more  
reproducible effects in healthy volunteers is enhanced vigilance with an increased ability to engage  
selective attention23, 26-[ADDRESS_90529]  MS patients  to participate  in studies  requiring multiple consecutive  
clinic visits for treatment. Daily travel to a treatment facility is a real-world limitation  because it is not 
feasible for those with a full work and family schedule (requiring  time taken from meeting these other  
obligations), or limited  mobility and/or  restricted transportation  options (which can be especially  
burdensome for caregivers). For example, all but one study of tDCS in MS to date (treating symptoms  of 
pain, fatigue,  sensory  and motor  functioning 31, 35-40 ) has included  more than five sessions, and none have  
enrolled more than 31 participants  (and, in this largest sample  size, participants only completed one tDCS  
session31). To study  multiple applications  of tDCS in MS, participants must be able to access  these 
treatments from  home .
To address  this need, we have developed a remotely-supervised telemedicine  protocol to provide access  
to tDCS treatment to participants in their homes. Our protocol was developed following our group’s  
extensive experience with a remotely-supervised  cognitive  remediation program 41, and meets  
collaborative guidelines  and standards that  we established working with a diverse  group  of tDCS clinical 
investigators42. As detailed below,  our protocol  is opposed to self-directed home use, where  a patient  is 
given a device without  parameters and real-time supervision, which is not advisable due to both  safety  
concerns as well as problems with  uniformity and reproducibility of results. Instead,  we maintain clinical 
trial standards for safety and consistency with a specially-designed tDCS device (that “unlocks” one  
“dose” per code, controlled by a study technician) with extensive  checkpoints  and built-in safety features  
for study using remote supervision  through a telemedicine videoconferencing  platform .
Feasibility and safety  study for our telemedicine tDCS protocol Consistent with  the demonstrated  
safety and tolerability across hundreds  of clinical  trials in tDCS58,59, including a total of eight  published 
trials in MS43,35, 37, 38, 44, we found very high tolerability in our feasibility study. In less than five months

Page 3 of 33
11/20/2017we administered 192 active tDCS sessions  in n=20  MS patients receiving 10 open-label sessions  over 
two weeks  (approaching the combined  published  experience of tDCS in MS fatigue). Participants have 
ranged in age from 30 to 69 years and included individuals  with all subtypes (n=6 relapsing remitting,  
n=12 secondary progressive,  n=2 primary progressive), and a range of disability from mild to severe  or 
wheelchair dependent  disability (EDSS scores of 1.0 to 8.0). No adverse effects or side effects of severe  
intensity have been reported in any session,  and no session has been  discontinued. As seen in Figure 1, 
the most common  adverse event reported  was  skin tingling,  and this did not exceed  an intensity of 
“moderate.”
Due to both the novelty of tDCS and the option to participate remotely, we have met  great interest  in our 
MS patient  community with rapid enrollment , limited only by [CONTACT_83024] ([ADDRESS_90530] over a three-month period). Compliance has been near-universal and all but one participant 
(95%) completed at least 8 of the 10 study  sessions  (this study  discontinuation was due to personal  
family events unrelated  to tDCS or the study). Further, the majority of participants have reported  benefit 
from tDCS and requested to continue  past the study’s 10 sessions.
Figure 1: Frequency of side  effects reported across [ADDRESS_90531] debilitating symptoms of MS that  remain without 
effective treatment: cognitive impairment  and fatigue.
Cognitive impairment:
Cognitive impairment occurs frequently  in MS and is without  an effective treatment option: Cognitive  
impairment occurs in up to 70% of all patients45-[ADDRESS_90532] common deficits are in the area  of working memory (WM),  measured  by [CONTACT_83025], attention, and new  learning50-[ADDRESS_90533] not been  effective47, 54, 55. Disease-modifying medication possibly slows  
the progression of deficits, but does not improve functioning55-59 . Symptomatic medications  such as the

11/20/2017cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (trials completed  at our  center)60-[ADDRESS_90534] treatment63, 64 and can include safety  concerns (e.g.,  potential for abuse65).
•Neural plasticity-based computerized cognitive training (CT) programs  are promising:  There  has been 
limited study  of CT in MS. Traditional approaches (e.g., clinician-delivered compensatory strategies and 
drill-and-practice training) are costly  and difficult to uniformly  implement, with inconsistent benefit66-[ADDRESS_90535] from  
home, targeting  60 sessions over 12 weeks 41. The remote access  has resulted  in rapid enrollment  of >160 
patients in two years; in comparison, in the largest published  CT trial in MS, an outpatient  memory  
training program with10 sessions  in five weeks, required >7 years  to enroll n=[ADDRESS_90536] led to the 
established procedures  to be used in this study to deliver remotely-supervised  cognitive  remediation.
•tDCS can increase the benefit of CT: While  many  questions remain, pairing  tDCS with CT has increased  
learning and performance particularly in tasks depending on WM27-[ADDRESS_90537] leads  to leads  
to greater  gains in a neuropsychological  testing composite z score when compared to playing ordinary  
computer games (n=135,  program by [CONTACT_83026]82, p=0.02,  report in preparation; and n=20,  program  
by [CONTACT_83027], 0.46 ± 0.59 improvement vs.−0.14 ± 0.48 decline,  p = 0.02  41). However, the difference in 
average improvement of the composite z-score is relatively modest,  z-score  0.20±0.36 vs. 0.05±0.31,  
p=0.02 , Cohen’s d =0.43. The proposed research will take the first step towards determining whether the 
benefit of CT can ultimately be improved when  combined with  tDCS.
Fatigue :
Fatigue is the most frequent  debilitating  symptom of MS and remains without  an effective treatment: 
75% or more of patients report it is among their most disabling MS problem83, 84, and 55% indicate it to 
be the worst85, 86. Defined by [CONTACT_83028], there  are 
serious adverse health  care consequences linked to fatigue in general, and MS fatigue in particular. 
Fatigued MS patients leave the work force early, have  increased health care utilization, and are at risk for 
depression87. However,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_83001] (initially  with the Fatigue Severity Scale or FSS,  
developed by [CONTACT_83029]-I  [CONTACT_83073]), the etiology of MS fatigue remains poorly understood88. MS 
fatigue is neither consistently linked  to disease severity as measured by [CONTACT_83030]89 nor disease duration90, although it is generally  found  to be worse with individuals  with 
the secondary progressive subtyp e83, 90-[ADDRESS_90538] from sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_83002]93. Multiple factors contribute  to fatigue, including CNS demyelination and axonal loss94, 
immunological changes,  MS-related  problems (trigeminal neuralgia, spasms),  psychological and chronic  
illness factors (depression, pain,  poor sleep), and medications95, 96.
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_82998]-delivered (tDCS) combined  with  cognitive  training  in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) (S15-[ZIP_CODE])
11/20/[ADDRESS_90539] been  attempted for fatigue  in MS but there remains no accepted or 
standardized treatment88. Fatigue may improve  with disease  modifying  therapy but there  is no evidence  of 
consistent benefit97-99 . No symptomatic  medication, including  large trials  of modafinil100, amantadine and 
pemoline 101, has been found to be reliably  effective86, 102 , 103. Behaviorally-based management  programs (e.g. 
cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions),  exercise programs103 and comprehensive 
strategies to manage MS fatigue directly104 have also been studied. While  these   treatment efforts have had 
somewhat more success than medications,  they are costly in terms of clinician and  patient time, usually require 
weekly or more frequent clinic visits for therapy, and are not widely available.  Overall, fatigue in MS has 
remained frustratingly treatment-resistant. A consistently effective,  reliable and accessible fatigue treatment 
option is greatly needed.
Of the eight published trials of tDCS to  date, three have directly  targeted fatigu e35, 37, 38. As shown in Table 1, 
all three have used sham-controlled crossover designs, and found significant  improvement in fatigue  
following active treatment in either  the full group or subset analyses35, 37, 38. Each  of the three  studies varied 
in their montage with similar results.

IV. SPECIFIC AIMS
Specific Aim 1: To  test the feasibility of a randomized, controlled remotely-supervised tDCS clinical 
trial protocol developed specifically for use in MS. Participants  (n=85) will  be randomly  assigned to 
receive 40 x 20-minute sessions of either active (up to 2.5 mA) paired with cognitive remediation, to  
two separate control conditions. The first is  an active  tDCS condition  paired  with  non-adaptive, 
traditional puzzle and board  games and will act as this  study’s negative control. The  second control will 
act as the study’s positive control  and will be sham tDCS paired with cognitive remediation. Each study 
session, regardless  of study arm, will be followed by [CONTACT_33018]  [ADDRESS_90541] 80% or n=32of the 
targeted 40 sessions.  Secondary outcomes will be comparison  of tolerability  and participant- reported side 
effects between the two treatment arms.

11/20/2017 Page 5 of  33 Specific Aim 2: To test the preliminary  efficacy of tDCS to treat fatigue  and  to enhance outcomes of 
cognitive training. These data will inform the design of a large,  controlled clinical  trial.
The primary  outcome will be comparisons between the active and control conditions on measures of 
fatigue and cognitive functioning.
V. DESCRIPTION OF THE  PROTOCOL
The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_83003] a structured protocol for safe remotely-supervised delivery  
of 40 consecutive  tDCS sessions  (active  and  control conditions) to be used in a randomized, 
controlled double-blind clinical  studies in participants with MS .
a)Study Desig n: Participants will complete a total of 40 sessions across  eight weeks: training at baseline 
with a study technician and then monitoring  (through secure  online video) by [CONTACT_83031]-nine sessions. We will use the most common montage of bilateral  dorsolateral  
prefrontal cortex  (DLFPC) placement,  with the anodal electrode  placed on the left side. This offers  ease of 
reliable electrode  placement and wide  therapeutic applications. Dose will be up to the target  of 2.5 mA 
with reduction to 2.0, 1.5, or 1.0 mA based  on tolerability testing  at baseline.  At study end, participants in 
the sham condition  will be offered 10 open  label  active sessions.
x
b) Study Equipment : For the remotely-supervised sessions, participants will be given the specially- 
designed tDCS device and headset, study  laptop  computer for secure  video  monitoring  with study  
technician (must  have internet access),  a detailed reference  manual, and a training video. The Soterix  
mini-CT is uniquely designed for remotely-supervised delivery and requires a one-time use code  
provided by [CONTACT_83032]. The device will not 
operate without  correct headset placement  and has a single-button option to abort  the session.  The 
device will also automatically abort the session  if optimal  conditions are not maintained. It reports and 
records a completion code for each session.
c) Randomization:  Participants  will be assigned to each condition in a 1:1:1 Stratified randomization  
procedure. Participants will be matched according to the degree of cognitive  impairment  (Symbol Digit  
Modalities test or SDMT105 score) and neurologic (motor) impairment  (Expanded Disability Status Scale  
or EDSS89 score).  Participants will be randomized to either the active tDCS condition paired with  
cognitive remediation or one of the two control conditions. The  positive control condition will consist of 
cognitive remediation paired with sham tDCS and the negative control  condition  will  consist of  active 
tDCS with non-adaptive puzzle and board games using block randomization of permuted block sizes 3 and 
6, based on our experience in cognitive remediation  trials. SDMT  performance will be categorized 
compared to published  age-normative  means (>0.99 SD, 1 to 2 SD and 2 to 3 SD below  mean)  and EDSS 
score will be categorized as mildly or moderately  impaired  (0 to 3.0 vs. 3.5 to 8.0).
d)Outcome  Measures : Before  and after each session, participants  will complete  brief  measures to 
monitor for any stimulation-related  events as well as mood and fatigue. In  addition  a pain scale  will be 
administered during the session.  Participants will also complete  baseline  and study-end inventories  of 
mood and fatigue and complete  a brief battery of cognitive tests  including the Brief  International 
Assessment of Cognition in MS or BICAMS106, to help guide power  estimates  for the future trials.  A 
summary of outcome measures can be found in Table 2.

11/20/2017e)Analytic Plan :
Specific Aim  1 is to determine feasibility;  to be measured by [CONTACT_83034]. As would be 
expected, there is a high rate of compliance  for in-clinic tDCS administration and therefore  remotely-  
supervised administration should be designed to be similarly  compliant. Study  success will be defined by 
80% participants having  completed 80% sessions,  shown to be the target compliance for previous  tDCS  
studies107  . We will also determine  the effectiveness of our sham procedures to ensure blinding, as tested  
by [CONTACT_83035]. We will assess  whether the frequency  
or type of side  effects  differ between the active and control conditions and whether they occur at the 
same  rate as reported  from studies  of in-clinic administration. Secondary outcomes will be tolerability,  
participant-reported adverse  events,  and comparisons of active  and control conditions on these 
measures.
Specific Aim [ADDRESS_90542] pi[INVESTIGATOR_83005]-powered clinical  trial. For each participant, change  
scores will be calculated between baseline  and study end scores on measures of fatigue and cognitive  
functioning. These difference scores will then  be described  and compared between groups (t-tests and 
ANOVA related  analyses) to determine signals of efficacy for active  tDCS paired with cognitive  
remediation vs. active tDCS paired with non-adaptive puzzle and  board  games  vs. sham tDCS  paired 
with cognitive remediation.
VI. METHODS  AND PROCEDURES
All remotely-supervised sessions will be completed while  connected to a video session  with the study  
technician. The protocol  is designed to have a decision-tree series  of checkpoints that must be met in 
order to proceed at each step (Figure 2). These checkpoints address compliance  (attendance, ability to 
complete the procedures as instructed, following  the study guidelines) and tolerability (at any time,  if any 
predefined events  are reported).  Following state  of the art in tDCS  research, devices will be programmed  
in advance by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_83006]33, 
108. During a sham session, the device is programmed to ramp up to the desired intensity (target 2.5 mA)  
and ramp down  for the initial 60 seconds,  with no current delivery during the following 18 minutes of the 
session, and then  current is ramped  up and down  for 60 seconds at  the end of the session. These  brief 
periods of stimulation  serve to mimic the effects of a true stimulation session.  Both  participants  and 
study coordinator (who administers study  outcome measures) will be blinded, and will be asked to guess 
the assigned  condition  at study end.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_83007]. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_83008]-blinded study technician will 
preprogram devices according to  randomization and then provide to the study coordinator for each 
participant. That is,  the study coordinator and participant will be blinded  to which condition 
programmed to the assigned device. All procedures will be the same for all three  conditions.  Adverse 
events will be addressed  in either condition, and the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_83009].

11/20/17Figure 2. Study stop criteria
Screening :
Participants for all groups will be recruited from the NYU Langone  Medical Center  Multiple  
Comprehensive Care  Center. Once a potential participant is identified,  a screening phone call will take 
place to determine general  eligibility (See section  IX. Consent Process). Once a participant is deemed  
generally eligible,  the individual  will be scheduled for a visit at NYU  to review and sign consent and 
complete screening procedures, including a medical clearance. For those interested in study  
participation, once eligibility is confirmed  by a NYU MS Center clinician, their baseline  appointment will 
be scheduled.
Baseline Visit :
*Note clinician  assessment for medical  clearance may  occur either before or at the baseline visit
All women who  are of child-bearing age will complete a pregnancy test  (human chorionic gonadotrophin 
urine assay) to assure  they are eligible for all study procedures.  Women who receive a result denoting 
heightened hCG  levels  will be considered study screen failures.  
Prior to tDCS training, the tests  and evaluations  detailed in Table [ADDRESS_90543]:
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_82998]-delivered (tDCS) combined  with  cognitive  training  in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) (S15-[ZIP_CODE])
Page 9 of 33
11/20/17●tDCS Aptitude : Participants will first  complete an aptitude test to confirm that they have  
the cognitive and motor skills required  for headset  placement. With instruction of the study technician, 
they will be asked  to insert the sponges onto the headset  and place the electrodes into the sponges. The 
technician will determine whether  or not the participant is qualified  to proceed. Participants will not be 
allowed to proceed  if they are not able to correctly either 1) attach  sponges to headset  or 2) place 
electrodes into  the sponges.
tDCS Tolerability:  The study technician will next directly place the headset and then initiate a one-minute  
test session, with  [ADDRESS_90544] amplitude tolerated,  following 0.5 mA decrements  (2.0, 1.5., and 1.0 mA.) till finally a base 
1.0 mA stimulation is  offered. Once  the tolerable dose is established,  it will remain constant  throughout the 
study. If the participant cannot tolerate any of the offered stimulation levels, they are excluded  from the  
study.
Remotely Monitored  Study  Sessions 2 to 40: 
These sessions will be completed  from home with  remote  monitoring  by [CONTACT_40433]. For 
participants in the sham condition who elect [ADDRESS_90545] to study  staff  via a secure internet-based video program.
They will put on the tDCS headgear while being monitored, and tell study staff if the device  feedback  
indicates that the electrodes are acceptably  placed.  The participant will then receive  the activation code  
from the tDCS device. If the study staff observes the participant making  any errors  that  may cause the latter 
discomfort they can intervene with instructions for correction.
Safety notes:
The tDCS device can only operate if: 1) the headset  is correctly placed for adequate connection,  and 
2) the study technician provides a session code that unlocks the device for a one-time only 20 
minute period of use.
If the device loses adequate contact  [CONTACT_32446], the device will automatically discontinue the 
session. The session can only be reestablished  if another unlock code is provided  by [CONTACT_83036].
If the participant  wishes  to discontinue the session at any time,  they will be instructed to press the 
“abort” key which  ramps down  the current within 30 seconds to allow for headset removal.
Study End Visit:
Within three days of their last session (including same day), participants will have their final study end 
visit in clinic. The tests  and evaluations administered at baseline will be given to the participant again 
(Table 1).  The equipment that had been provided to the participant for this study will be returned on  this 
visit.

11/20/17Online/Telephone Survey:
One month  following  the study end visit, participants will receive an online  survey  to complete through

completed at follow-up,  as well as the Multiple  Sclerosis Neuropsychological  Questionnaire (MSNQ), 
PROMIS Measure of Fatigue, Mood  and Health-Related  Quality of Life, Neuro-Quality of Life measures, the 
Fatigue Impact Scale, the Fatigue Severity  Scale, and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS).  In 
addition to these 7 measures, participants will be asked  to assess their experience with the study:
“Overall, did you feel a benefit from participating in this trial? If so, how?  If so, has the benefit 
lasted?”

Vulnerable Subjects
Participants with MS may be considered as vulnerable subjects due to cognitive  impairment; however,  
those who  lack capacity  to consent will not be enrolled in this study. For all participants, we will confirm  
capacity to consent  with their care provided at the visit. We will also screen those with estimated overall 
cognitive impairment and reading  ability by [CONTACT_17801] a reading measure Wide Range Achievement  
Test 4 (WRAT-4). It will be clearly explained  and written for all potential participants that the study is 
entirely optional and there will be no negative consequences to their decision not to participate.
VIII. STUDY  LOCATION
Participants screening, baseline and study  end visits will be completed at the NYU MS Langone MS 
Comprehensive Care  Center, [ADDRESS_90549], 18th Floor, NY NY [ZIP_CODE], or the satellite location for the

For participants with limited mobility,  visits can be completed from the participant’s home.
IX. DATA ANALYSES AND DATA MONITORING
Database and Patient  Information
Data will be entered  in the HIPAA- compliant  NYU REDCap database designed specifically for this study.  
An anonymous  database number will be assigned to each participant and will be used for both the Data 
Entry Sheet and the Patient Follow-up Sheets. The original  front sheet, which includes the patient name 
[CONTACT_83070],  will be stored separately in a locked filing cabinet in a locked office. Access to this data 
will be restricted  to study personnel only. Research data will be entered  online through the secure  NYU  
database software REDCap and source  documents  will be kept  in a locked filing  cabinet in a locked office.  
Patient clinical data  will be entered directly into the Patient Registry (on-line entry). Participant data will 
be coded by [CONTACT_83042].
Additional Quality Assurance Measures
Development  of standard protocols to perform all data collection and follow-up activities.
Use of standardized forms.
Uniform criteria for patient recruitment.
Standardized  data  processing.
Regular communications between study staff and study investigators  to resolve questions.
Performance monitoring of data  collection and data processing activities,  as well  as preparation of 
periodic reports and analyses on performance monitoring.
Monthly  monitoring of recruitment statistics.
Monitoring
We will utilize operating procedures for reviewing patient safety data and source data  generated  from  
this study. This will include weekly  meetings between the PI. Co-investigators,  and study coordinator. At 
these meetings, the entire research team  will review  the clinical ratings, assessments,  clinical  course,  and 
medical records  for each subject. Consideration  of droppi[INVESTIGATOR_83010]. If after  the completion  of the first  10 subjects  the compliance is significantly less in one or 
more  arm  of the study  relative  to our previously  observed  compliance  rates , the study will be put on hold 
and reviewed. Based on the extensive body of literature  using tDCS across a range of conditions, and our initial  
participants studied  to date  (completed at Stony Brook Medicine, we have had >94% compliance in the active  
condition. Therefore, this  discrepancy in compliance  is not expected. We would define discrepancy  in compliance 
as >50% difference in mean  number of visits  completed and/or 50%  difference in number of “completers” in each 
condition (defined  by [CONTACT_9159] 50%  of n=5/10 sessions)  109.   If there is significantly poor compliance  in 
the active session,  we will be able to identify  reasons including  tolerability  as well as symptom  experiences.  
Tolerability is measured before, during and after  each session and all participants  will be monitored for all 
sessions. Safety is carefully  addressed in our protocol with a series  of stop criteria and clearly defined action items.
Specific attention will be given to data quality  and timeliness, HIPAA-complaint,  safe storage of data,  and 
data backup of electronic source data.  Attention  will also be given to participant  recruitment, accrual and 
retention, participant risk versus  benefit,  adverse events, and other factors that  can affect study outcome,  
including scientific or therapeutic developments that may have  an impact on the safety  of the participants 
or the ethics of the study.

11/20/17An adverse event is defined as any rating  (at any time) of pain  of greater than  “moderate” or side 
effects or sensations that arise preceding,  during, or following stimulation. Pain and tolerability are 
measured before, during and after each session.  As noted, there  is an extensive body of literature 
demonstrating the safety and tolerability of tDCS both in MS and in a range of clinical disorders. Our 
lab at Stony Brook Medicine  administered  >200 active tDCS sessions to MS participants  with no pain 
ratings of severe or greater and no discontinued session (for any reason, safety  or tolerability)109. 
Figure 3 below demonstrates  these  results.
Figure 3. Self- applied tDCS sessions across n=[ADDRESS_90551] deviations (SD)  will be 
compared between subgroups on the measures using  conventional cut-off points  for each of the 
symptoms will be compared.
Specific Aim 1 will be tested by [CONTACT_83043] (having  completed 80% sessions). We will also determine  the 
effectiveness of our sham procedures to ensure blinding, as tested  by [CONTACT_83044]. We will assess whether  the frequency  or type  of side effects  differ 
between the three conditions and whether they occur at the same  rate as reported from studies of in-
clinic administration.

11/20/17Specific Aim [ADDRESS_90552] pi[INVESTIGATOR_83005]-powered clinical  trial. For each participant, change  
scores will be calculated between baseline  and study end scores on measures of fatigue and cognitive  
functioning. These difference scores will then  be described  and compared between groups (t-tests and 
ANOVA related  analyses) to determine signals of efficacy.
Cognitive performance will be evaluated for those who  completed at least 18 sessions. We conservatively  
plan for comparison  of 15 participants in each group, allowing  for up to 33% dropout. While  both  
cognitive remediation groups  are expected to improve with cognitive training, we hypothesize that the 
active tDCS condition will gain one standard  deviation (of the published  normative mean) or more  in 
score than the sham condition and that the  group with active  tDCS paired with non-adaptive puzzle  and 
board games  will neither  improve nor decline.
Secondary outcomes  will be used to compare the groups in change in performance on the additional  
measures listed  in Table 2. These are the most  commonly-used outcome measures  in MS trials52, 106, 112,
113. While  important to include, they will not be the primary outcome due to strong susceptibility of 
improvement with practice effects  over  repeated administrations in MS samples52, 113-[ADDRESS_90553] been planned for the primary outcome will be performed for comparing the change  in these  
secondary outcomes between two groups.

X. SUBJECT RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT/ASSENT
Subject Identification,  Recruitment and Consent/Assent  
Method of Subject  Identification and Recruitment
The MS Comprehensive Care Center of NYU Langone Medical  Center has an extensive recruitment  base. 
Patients will be recruited to participate in studies from  all over [LOCATION_001] and the other continental 
[LOCATION_002].  Patients who are seen by [CONTACT_83046], who fit the 
eligibility criteria, will be referred  for the study  by [CONTACT_46575] [INVESTIGATOR_9814]-investigators. All physicians and 
medical staff at the MS Care Center  will be presented with the study description. A patient who is seeing 
one of  these  medical staff members as their treating physician will be introduced to the study  by [CONTACT_83047]. If the patient is interested  and agrees, then a member of the study staff  will contact 
[CONTACT_476]. Once a patient is identified, study  staff will meet  with the patient or call them  to provide additional 
information
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_82998]-delivered (tDCS) combined  with  cognitive  training  in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) (S15-[ZIP_CODE])
Page 10 of 33
11/20/17regarding study  participation. After  the patient has reviewed the consent form and asked all questions,  
and provides consent to participate, the patient  will be enrolled in the study.
Advertisements
An IRB approved flyer will be posted in local physician offices and waiting rooms and throughout NYU, 
the surrounding community, and on Long Island. A description of the study will be posted on MS related  
websites.
Process of Consent
All potential  participants  will complete  a screening interview to ensure general eligibility. The study staff  
member speaking to the subject  will provide the subject with  an overview  of the study and verbally 
receive their  permission, under a waiver of documentation of consent, to complete the general eligibility  
screening. This phone  screen is minimal  risk to the participant and collected  information will be 
maintained in secured, locked files.  De-identified  information (assigned a study  screening code) will be 
entered into  a secure, NYU approved  online screening database.  If a participant is not eligible, they will be 
considered a screen  fail. No additional information will be collected. PHI will be destroyed immediately if 
a participant is not eligible or does not return to sign written consent/authorization to participate. Only 
study staff will have  access to these records.
Once the participant  is generally eligible,  the PI, or one of the trained study team members  will review  
the consent form with the subject and explain the purpose of the study, the procedures, as well as risks  
and benefits.  All questions  will be addressed before acquiring the participant’s signed  consent.
[CONTACT_83073] will be responsible for assessing the capacity  to consent. An independent  assessor will 
not be utilized.  There is a large body of literature indicating no known safety or tolerability risk for use of  
tDCS. Further, tDCS  is currently being studied as an alternative  to relatively higher risk treatments  (such  
as medication)  in special populations such as pregnant women  and developmentally disabled  children.  
Published studies  in MS, including the work  in our lab at Stony Brook  Medicine, show tDCS to be a 
tolerable and safe treatment approach. [CONTACT_83074] and team at the MS Center are MS specialists with 
extensive experience  in the assessment of patients with MS, including cognitive capacity, and including 
capacity to consent  for numerous clinical  drug  trials where  there is a substantially greater potential  risk  
posed than  what are the known risks  for tDCS. Therefore, taken together, we do not believe that the use 
of tDCS represents a situation where an independent party would be needed.
[CONTACT_83074] is an internationally renowned expert of cognition in MS. She has the expertise  in MS and 
cognitive related  symptoms  of MS to specifically be capable of determining cognitive  capacity of potential 
participants. She is a professor  of neurology  and the director  of the NYU MS Center. She has over [ADDRESS_90554]. Krupp also served in the same medical 
monitoring role  for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_83011], where n=[ADDRESS_90555] successfully  
completed our study  protocol that has included over 200 active tDCS sessions.
Participants will be informed of the assessment  and consequences  of the assessment  – those who  refuse  
the capacity assessment  will not be enrolled.  The assessment involves a MS Neurological  Examination 
including EDSS, Physical  Examination summary to address General, HEENT, Lungs, COR, Abdomen,  
Extremities, and Skin. Additionally,  [CONTACT_83074] will base capacity to consent on the participants 
understanding of the following 4 items  a) that the activity described in this consent document constitutes 
research, not standard  treatment, b) the risks and benefits of this study c) the alternatives that  are 
available if s/he chooses not to participate, and d) that  the decision to not participate will be accepted  
without penalty, i.e., without jeopardizing  his/her  clinical care.

Page 10 of 33
11/20/17Process to Document Consent in Writing
After review of the consent  form and prior to the start of the first session, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_83012]- 
investigators will obtain written  consent with  a signature [CONTACT_83071]. All original 
signed consent  forms  will be maintained in the study file, separate  from the participant data.
Subject Capacity
All participants will be confirmed to have the capacity to provide consent by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lauren Krupp as 
described above.   Further, those participants with estimated premorbid intellectual functioning  and/or  
impaired reading  ability (as determined by [CONTACT_83048]-[ADDRESS_90556]), and those with severely  
impaired information processing speed  (as determined by [CONTACT_83049]) will be excluded.
Debriefing Procedures
No information will be purposely withheld  from  the subjects. A clinical neuropsychologist (PI) and the 
treatment team  will be available to answer  any questions concerning  the tests  and results, and provide  
initial feedback as warranted, including referral  for clinical neuropsychological assessment.
Consent Forms
Participants will receive a NYU consent form  to review and sign prior to participating in the study.
Documentation of Consent
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_83013]. An 
enrollment log will be maintained and consent forms will be kept  in secure  location separate from the 
participant’s data.
Costs to the Subject
There will be no cost to the participants.
Risk to Participants
As described above,  tDCS poses low  risks to participants and  our protocol  is well-tolerated. To our  
knowledge, hundreds of tDCS studies in the US have all been designated Non-Significant-Risk  (NSR) the 
lowest risk level  (devices that are not: intended as an implant with potential for serious  risk to health, 
safety, or welfare of subject; purported or represented to be for use in supporting  or sustaining  human 
life with a potential for serious  risks; for use of substantial importance in diagnosing curing, mitigating, 
treating disease  or otherwise preventing  impairment  of human health with  potential  for significant risk;  
otherwise presents  significant risk to the health,  safety, or welfare  of a subject). For these  reasons, the 
Soterix Mini CT, as used in this study, also  qualifies  as a NSR device.  While  tDCS remains an 
investigational technique (simply because no company has applied to the FDA for approval to market 
tDCS for any given indication), tDCS is a broadly reproduced and tested  techniques  that is considered  
effective in modulating brain excitability in a manner that may  support learning and with adverse  events  
(different than sham) limited to tingling, itching, and redness that dispel after stimulation stops. In a 
prior study of use in a vulnerable  population (developmentally disabled  children), the FDA issued  a NSR  
for tDCS  device (see attached letter). The letter provided as an example of the FDA’s designation of tDCS  
devices as IDE.  Because  of its prior designation of tDCS devices  as IDE, trials do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_83014]. In the letter  provided, [CONTACT_83075]  specifically sought FDA  review of the trial due to the 
use of tDCS in a vulnerable population  (developmentally disabled children).  To date, hundreds of trials 
have been designated as non-signficant-risk by [CONTACT_83050].  Results  of 
completed trials, including our own work in MS using this protocol, have supported the risk designation  
provided by [CONTACT_1202]. The Stony Brook Medicine  IRB confirmed the NSR and IDE status of tDCS for our study
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_82998]-delivered (tDCS) combined  with  cognitive  training  in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) (S15-[ZIP_CODE])
Page 10 of 33
11/20/17and others at the institution.  We have learned that the NYU IRB has also confirmed tDCS devices  
(including those manufactured by [CONTACT_83051]) as IDE for current ongoing  studies at this institution.
The safety of this technique has been  addressed  and tested by [CONTACT_83052] (e.g.,  Hummel, et 
al.117; Fregni,  et. al.19, 118; Nitsche, et al. 13, 24, 119; Priori, et al.120) who  have concluded that tDCS, as applied 
in a manner similar to our proposed protocol,  induces only temporary mood, cognitive / motor effects,  
and no negative side effects.  For example, researchers at the National  Institute of Neurological  
Disorders and Stroke  (NINDS), Iyer et al.19 conducted a safety study on tDCS, investigating 20-minute  
sessions of 1 mA and 2 mA current  stimulation  with healthy controls  (n=103). No negative  effects were  
identified. Nitsche and colleagues found  no measurable structural changes in brain tissue due to tDCS121. 
In a meta-analysis  of over 200  tDCS  studies conducted  from 1998 to 2010, 56% of studies  mentioned  
adverse events,  which  were generally minor. The most  commonly reported side effects included  itching, 
tingling, headache,  burning  sensation and discomfort limited to the scalp site where  the tDCS electrodes  
were applied. To date, there have been  no reports of seizures  induced by [CONTACT_32101]14. Importantly this is the 
case in normal volunteers,  but also  in different  populations of patients,  including patients with disorders  
where there  might be an increased risk of seizures (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease, recent stroke, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]).  A 
study from  NYU on the use of tDCS in patients  with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]122 encountered no increase in complications 
of tDCS in the patients as compared  with controls. Specifically,  there were no instances of seizures  
induced by [CONTACT_32101].
Participants in all groups may  find the questionnaires  time  consuming  and potentially  bothersome.  
Neuropsychological testing  and the computer training sessions may, in some individuals, be stressful  or 
anxiety producing. There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality. Participants will be assigned a study ID 
and their  name  [CONTACT_83072].  The program used  for brain training 
games will not collect  any personally identifiable  information. The results of these  data collected  may be 
used for publication but will not include the participants’ names. Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_83015], locked files and data  will be entered in a secure,  NYU approved  database
Benefits to Participants
Participants may have some benefit from  this study. The cognitive training sessions (brain training 
games) may  enhance cognitive  functioning for all groups. Additionally,  participants  in the active tDCS  
condition, as well  as those in the sham  condition  who elect  for [ADDRESS_90557] an increase in cognitive  functioning  through the use of the tDCS device. We hope the knowledge  
gained from this study will help  others with  MS in the future.
Payment for Participation
Participant will receive  up to $100 in total compensation. They will be compensated  $50 for the initial 
screening and baseline  visit, and $[ADDRESS_90558] the study technician by 
[CONTACT_83053].
XI.EXPLORATORY  AIM: FEASIBILITY IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE
Purpose
We have established the feasibility and safety  of the current protocol in MS and now  plan  to extend  its 
use to other  neurological disorders.  The purpose  of this additional aim is to test the feasibility  of the
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_82998]-delivered (tDCS) combined  with  cognitive  training  in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) (S15-[ZIP_CODE])
11/20/2017 page 20 of 
3131established remotely supervised in-home self-administered  tDCS combined with computerized cognitive  
activities in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients.
Background
Parkinson’s disease is the second leading neurodegenerative disease and affects near 5.[ADDRESS_90559] relatively low rates of success. Investigators face major challenges, 
mostly in recruitment  and retention of participants, largely due to the difficulty maintaining compliance 
from a patient suffering from PD. Common  symptoms in PD that  potentially interfere  with compliance 
include poor mobility, impaired equilibrium, fatigue, mood disorder, lack of motivation  (apathy) and fear  
of the potential adverse consequences/side effects of taking  part in clinical trials.
The safety profile, tolerability, and ease  of applicability of conventional tDCS are very well established  
and are promising technical strengths that could  lead to a complementary therapy in PD. Conventional 
tDCS therapy in PD has yielded promising results  improving executive function22, gait 123-[ADDRESS_90560] 25 participants128. Adequately powered, sham-controlled clinical  trials 
are needed to ascertain  real therapeutic applications and we hope  to establish a remotely-supervised  
protocol to guide future studies using  tDCS  in PD
For this Exploratory Aim, remote tDCS  feasibility  in Parkinson’s disease, the protocol will be open  label 
and mirrored for the active tDCS condition. We initially plan enrolling 30 participants with PD
Exploratory Aim
Exploratory Aim: We will test the feasibility  of remotely-supervised in-home  
self-administered tDCS combined  with computerized cognitive activities in 
Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Participants  (n=30) will be trained  to administer  active 
tDCS and complete a cognitive training activity in their home under remote  
supervision by [CONTACT_464].
Hypothesis 1: Remotely-supervised in-home delivery of the tDCS combined with  
computerized cognitive activity is a safe  and feasible treatment  for impairment 
in Parkinson’s disease.
Primary outcome will be number  of days of successful tDCS delivery. Secondary  
outcomes will be tolerability and participant-reported adverse  events, fatigue and 
mood.
Description of the protocol
Will mirror the exact protocol detailed  in section V, however this study will be an open  
label feasibility study,  with  all participants receiving active, open-label tDCS. There  will be no 
sham condition  for the PD aim.

Page 21 of 33
11/20/2017Methods and Procedures
Will mirror the exact methods detailed  in section VI, with  the exception that this study will 
be an open  label feasibility study, with all participants receiving active, open-label tDCS. The 
exploratory aim to test the methods  in a PD population  will also run for a shorter duration. The 
treatment will occur over  the course of [ADDRESS_90561] initial feasibility of the 
methods in PD. Participants will attend the initial baseline visit in clinic, with  the remaining  9 
sessions occurring from home with remote supervision.
PD Specific Outcome Measures: Before and after  each session, participants will complete brief 
measures to monitor for any stimulation-related events as well as mood and  fatigue. In addition,  a 
pain scale will be administered  during the  session. Participants will also  complete baseline and 
study-end inventories of mood and fatigue and complete a  brief  battery  of cognitive  tests,  to help 
guide power estimates for the future trials. A  summary of outcome measures can be found  in Table 3.

Study Location
Participants screening, baseline and study  end visits will be completed at the Fresco Institute for 
Parkinson’s Disease  and Movement  Disorders  at NYU Langone  Medical  Center,  [ADDRESS_90563], 20th Floor, NY, NY [ZIP_CODE];  or alternatively  at the 18th floor,  the NYU Langone MS 
Comprehensive Care  Center  ([ADDRESS_90564], 18 th Floor, NY NY [ZIP_CODE]). For participants with 
limited mobility,  visits  can be completed from  the participant’s home.
Data Analyses and Data Monitoring
These items will mirror  exactly the procedures detailed in section IX, with the exception  of the Statistical 
Analyses (detailed  below)
Statistical Analyses
Data analyses will be descriptive to inform protocol development for a larger  controlled clinical 
trial. To determine feasibility of number of days of successful administration will be calculated. 
Any participants who  fail either an aptitude or tolerability test at baseline  will be characterized  
with clinical and cognitive factors.
Subject Identification,  Recruitment and Consent/Assent  
Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment
The Fresco Institute  for Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders of NYU  Langone  Medical 
Center has an extensive  recruitment base. Patients  will be recruited to participate in studies from
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_82998]-delivered (tDCS) combined  with  cognitive  training  in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) (S15-[ZIP_CODE])
Page 26 of 33
11/20/2017all over [LOCATION_001]  and the other  continental  [LOCATION_002]. Patients who are seen by [CONTACT_83057],  who fit the eligibility criteria,  will be referred for the study by [CONTACT_83058] [INVESTIGATOR_9814]-investigators. All physicians and medical staff  at Fresco Institute  will be 
presented with the study description. A patient who is seeing one of these medical staff members  
as their treating physician will be introduced  to the study by [CONTACT_83059]. If the 
patient is interested and agrees, then a member of the study staff will contact [CONTACT_476]. Once a patient 
is identified, study staff will meet with  the patient or call them  to provide additional information  
regarding study participation. After  the patient has reviewed the consent form  and asked all 
questions, and provides consent  to participate, the patient  will be enrolled  in the study and 
medically cleared.
Advertisements
An IRB approved flyer  will be posted in local  physician offices and waiting rooms and throughout  
NYU, the surrounding  community, and on Long Island. A description of the study will be posted on 
Fresco Institute related  websites.
Process of Consent
All potential  participants  will complete a screening interview to ensure general eligibility. The 
study staff  member speaking to the subject will provide the subject with  an overview  of the study  
and verbally  receive their permission,  under a waiver of documentation  of consent, to complete 
the general  eligibility screening. This phone screen is minimal risk to the participant and collected  
information will be maintained in secured,  locked  files. De-identified information  (assigned a 
study screening code) will be entered into a secure, NYU approved online  screening  database. If a 
participant is not eligible, they will be considered  a screen fail. No additional information will be 
collected. PHI will be destroyed immediately  if a participant is not eligible  or does not return to 
sign written consent/authorization to participate. Only study staff will have access  to these  
records. . Once  the participant is generally  eligible, the PI, or one of the trained study team 
members will review the consent form with the subject  and explain the purpose  of the study, the 
procedures, as well as risks  and benefits. All questions will be addressed before acquiring the 
participant’s signed consent.
[CONTACT_83076] will be responsible for assessing the capacity to consent. An independent assessor will 
not be utilized.  There is a large body of literature indicating no known safety or tolerability risk for 
use of tDCS.  Further,  tDCS is currently being studied as an alternative to relatively  higher risk  
treatments (such as medication) in special  populations such as pregnant women  and 
developmentally disabled children. Published studies in MS and other neurological diseases,  
including the work in our lab at Stony  Brook  Medicine, show tDCS to be a tolerable and safe  
treatment approach.  Dr. DiRocco and team at the Fresco Institute for Parkinson’s  and Movement 
Disorders in the Department of Neurology at NYU are movement disorder specialists  with 
extensive experience  in the assessment  of patients with Parkinson’s disease, including cognitive  
capacity, and including capacity to consent for numerous clinical drug trials where  there is a 
substantially greater  potential risk posed than what are the known risks for tDCS. Therefore,  taken  
together, we do not believe that  the use of tDCS represents a situation  where  an independent party 
would be needed. Additionally, Drs. Biagioni  and Shashank will base capacity to consent on the 
participants understanding of the following 4 items a) that  the activity described in this consent 
document constitutes research, not standard  treatment, b) the risks  and benefits of
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_82998]-delivered (tDCS) combined  with  cognitive  training  in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) (S15-[ZIP_CODE])

11/20/2017this study  c) the alternatives that are available if s/he chooses not to participate, and d) that the 
decision to not participate  will be accepted without penalty, i.e., without jeopardizing his/her  
clinical care.

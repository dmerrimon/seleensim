Patients with Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation  
CIP  NUMBER  / 
REVISION   CS0934 Revision D  
PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE  To determine whether there is  valid scientific evidence that endocardial 
ablation using the FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation System  is both 
safe and effective for treating drug -resistant symptomatic PAF.  
PRIMARY CLINICAL 
HYPOTHES IS Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) created by [CONTACT_550310] – force -sensing 
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryoballoon ablation  (CBA) – in the 
treatment of drug -resistant symptomatic P AF. 
INVESTIGATIONAL 
DEVICES  
SECTION 2 FARAPULSE ™ Pulsed Field Ablation System  
• FARAWAVE ™ Pulsed Field Ablation Catheters and 
FARASTAR ™ Catheter Connection Cable  
• FARASTAR ™ Pulsed Field Ablation Generator, 
FARASTAR ™ Stimulation Module, FARASTAR ™ Recording 
System Module and associated cables 
• FARADRIVE ™ Steerable  Sheath  
INTENDED USE 
SECTION 2.[ADDRESS_722163] of care ablation with force-sensing RF catheters and cryoballoon catheters indicated for the treatment of PAF .  
Subjects with documented drug- resistant ( Class I to  IV) PAF who have 
had ≥ 2 PAF epi[INVESTIGATOR_42988] 6 months  of enrollment will undergo 
percutaneous endocardial ablation for PVI . Subjects with typi[INVESTIGATOR_169244]-
sided (isthmus- dependent) atrial flutter (AFL) may undergo ablative 
interruption of the cavo- tricuspid isthmus (CTI).  
Class I  / III antiarrhythmic  drugs ( AADs ) will be discontinued at Day 
60 ± 10, subject to Investigator discretion. 
Safety:  Subjects will be followed at 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months 
and 12 months for adverse events (AEs) . A composite device - and 
procedure- related serious adverse event ( SAE ) rate will be compared 
between randomization groups for non- inferiority . 
Effectiveness:  Subjects will be monitored with weekly scheduled plus 
symptom-driven event monitoring, as well as 6 and 12- month  Holter 
monitoring, for freedom from recurrent arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation 
[AF], AFL or atrial tachycardia [ AT]) after the Blanking Period (Days 
0 - 90). The proportion of subjects free of post-blanking recurrent arrhythmia  (AF, AFL or AT ), re- ablation or Class I / III  AAD use  will 
be compared between randomization groups for non- inferiority.  
SAMPLE SIZE 
SUMMARY  
SECTION 4.4 A maximum of 900 subjects may be enrolled in this study.  
Roll-In Subjects : Up to 105 subjects (the first 1 -3 Enrolled S ubjects at 
each site) will be treated with the FARAPULSE devices in a manner 
consistent with the randomized Pulsed Field Group  and will be 
analyzed and reported separately.  
ITT S ubjects:  An estimated 450 MITT Subjects will be required to 
support the proposed non- inferiority outcomes.  Interim sample size re -
estimation may decrease this number to 350 or increase it to a maximum of 750. Up to 45 additional subjects (6%) may be enrolled to 
compensate for those ITT Subjects who do not meet the criteria for the 
MITT Population. 
INVESTIGATIONAL 
SITES 
SECTION 4.5 Up to 35 investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002].  
No site may enroll more than 45 ITT Subjects ( excludes Roll -In 
Subjects and ITT Subjects who do not qualify for the MITT 
population) with an intended minimum of 10 subjects per site. Should interim sample size re-estimation lead to an increase in the number of 
MITT Subjects greater than 450, each site will be limited to 10% of the increased total.  
FARAPULSE  ADVENT  TRIAL  OCTOBER 13, [ADDRESS_722164] 600 
subjects (105 Roll-Ins plus 495 ITT Subjects) is estimated to take 1 8 
months and subjects will be followed for up to 13 months. There will 
be a 3 -month period of site close-out visits, for a planned study 
duration of approximately 40 months. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)- related disruptions and interim sample size re -estimation 
may alter this timeframe.  
Subject participation is anticipated to be 13 ± 1 months to allow for 
screening, pre- procedural diagnostic procedures, randomization, 
treatment and 12 ±[ADDRESS_722165] requires a 
Rescheduled Index Procedure, this may prolong participation by [CONTACT_8622] 2 to 3 months.

CS0934,  REVISION D  PAGE 5 
 INDEX PROCEDURE  
SECTION 5.2 Index Procedure  / Rescheduled Index Procedure:  All subjects will 
be screened for completion of a minimum of [ADDRESS_722166] prior to or at the 
time of the Index Procedure and will be rescheduled if these conditions 
are not met .  
PVI:  Subjects will undergo an attempt to isolate all PV s or their 
anatomic equivalent with the randomized devices: 
• P ulsed Field Group with the FARAPULSE Pulsed Field 
Ablation System  
• Thermal Group with either a study-approved RFA or CBA 
system . Sites will use either RFA or CBA exclusively to treat 
subjects randomized to the Thermal Group. 
CTI:  Subjects in either the Pulsed Field or Thermal Groups with a past 
history of CTI -mediated (typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) AFL , who manifest typi[INVESTIGATOR_550259] a procedure or within the Blanking Period, or who have 
inducible typi[INVESTIGATOR_382868], may undergo ablation of the CTI at the discretion of the Investigator using any approved RF catheter during the Index / Rescheduled  Index Procedure or any re-ablation procedure.  
Other Ablation : O
 ther ablation is not permitted under this protocol 
except  when the Investigator determines that subject welfare requires 
ablation for an accessory pathway , atrioventricular nodal reentrant 
tachycardia (AVNRT) , treatment -emergent left -sided AFL or incessant 
AT. 
RE-ABLATION 
PROCEDURES  
SECTION 5.4 Re-ablation under this protocol requires documentation of Detectable 
AF, AFL or AT. When performed, r e-ablation will be performed 
utilizing a n approved study ablation catheter (RFA or CBA) at 
Investigator discretion.   
Any re -ablation procedure for AF, AFL or AT during study follow -up 
constitutes a Treatment Failure . 
However, CTI ablation or re-ablation for right-sided typi[INVESTIGATOR_550260]- up and does not 
constitute a Treatment Failure . 
FARAPULSE  ADVENT  TRIAL  OCTOBER 13, [ADDRESS_722167]-procedure MRI until the study enrollment target of 
evaluable scans is met.  
The MRI will be performed using standardized parameters to elicit 
characteristics of silent cerebral  events (SCEs) and silent cerebral 
lesions (SCLs).  If a post -procedural SCE or SCL is confirmed, then the 
NAS subject will undergo a pre- discharge neurological assessment and 
a follow-up brain MRI during the 90 Day Assessment window. 
ANTIARRHYTHMIC 
DRUGS  
SECTION 5.9 Antiarrhythmic drugs ( AADs ), except for amiodarone , may be utilized 
during the Blanking Period at the Investigator’s discretion. On Day 60 ± [ADDRESS_722168] will be contact[CONTACT_550311]. 
Class I  / III AADs should be stopped at the Day 60 Assessment. 
However, at the Investigator’s discretion, Class I / III AADs may be continued up to Day 90 without creating a Treatment Failure . 
The use of amiodarone at any time during the study, except intra -
procedurally to control an arrhythmia, or the use of Class I / III AADs after Day 90, constitute a Treatment Failure.

2. The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life ( AFEQT ) 
instrument for the measurement of health -related quality of life  
RANDOMIZATION  
SECTION 9.2 Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be 
randomized using a 1:1 allocation ratio.  
Each site will utilize only one control modality – either RFA or CBA – 
and will use that modality for all subjects randomized to the Thermal Group. Site activation and enrollment will be monitored and when necessary controlled to maintain a minimum 40% pro portion of 
Thermal Subjects in either the RFA or CBA modality.  
POPULATIONS FOR 
ANALYSIS  
SECTION 9.4 Several analysis populations are defined for this study , including : 
• Safety Subjects 
• Modified Intent -to-Treat (MITT) Subjects  
• Per Protocol (PP) Subjects  
ASSESSMENT OF 
THE PRIMARY 
SAFETY ENDPOINT  
SECTION 9.5 The primary safety endpoint for this study is the Composite Safety Endpoint (CSE) which will be analyzed as a test of non- inferiority of 
the event rate at 12 months using a non- inferiority margin of 8%. 
Statistical methods are Bayesian.  
FARAPULSE  ADVENT  TRIAL  OCTOBER 13, [ADDRESS_722170] of non -inferiority of the event rate at 
12 months using a non- inferiority margin of 15%. Statistical methods 
are Bayesian.  
SAMPLE SIZE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
SECTION 9.[ADDRESS_722171] considerations are used to guide sample size 
selection . 
Parameter selection:  Published IDE studies with available 
information comparing new devices with approved control devices have all used non- inferiority designs with one -sided alpha of 0.05 and 
15% effectiveness margins and either 8% or 9% safety margins.  
Sample size requirements for safet y: The sample size for primary 
safety  was estimated  for a Farrington -Manning test with PASS 13 
indicates that, for 1:1 randomization, 90% power, alpha=0.05 (one -
sided), CSE rate in both Groups of 0.08 and non- inferiority margin of 
0.08. Assuming a 5% rate of loss -to-follow-up (LTFU), 450 subjects 
are needed. Uncertainty in the CSE rate motivates the use of a design wherein the sample size is adaptively determined, with possible sample sizes ranging from 350 to 750. 
Sample size requirements for effectiveness : The sample size required 
for the primary effectiveness endpoint was estimated  by [CONTACT_276757] 13  for 
1:1 randomization, 90% power, alpha=0.05 (one-sided) , success rates 
in each group of 0.65 and non- inferiority margin of 0.15. Assuming a 
10% rate of LTFU, 3 82 subjects are needed. U ncertainty in the 
Treatment Success rate motivates the use of a design wherein the 
sample size is adaptively determined, with possible sample sizes ranging from 200 to 550.   
Number of Enrolled Subjects : The primary population for the 
analysis of effectiveness is the MITT Population. The Safety  
Population should be similar but will not be smaller. Considering the 
joint sample size needs of the primary safety and effectiveness objectives, the primary analysis population may range from a minimum of 350 to a maximum of 750. 
To achieve a sample size of 750 MITT  Subjects , up to 900 subjects 
may be enrolled consisting of 750 MITT  and up to 105 Roll -In 
Subjects and up to 45 ITT  Subjects (6%) who do not meet the criteria 
for the MITT Population.

CS0934,  REVISION D  PAGE 11 
 ANALYSIS PLAN 
SECTION 9.8 This trial is designed using Bayesian statistical techniques.  The sample 
size will be  determined adaptively via a Goldilocks design, with 
possible sample sizes of N=350, 450, 550, 650, and 750.   
At each of the four interim sample size assessments, the predictive 
probabilit y that the trial will end in a determination of non- inferiority 
for both safety and effectiveness will be computed and compared to 
pre-specified thresholds.  A determination will be made to stop 
enrollment for predicted success, to stop enrollment for predicted 
futility, or to continue enrollment to the next larger sample size.  
Once subject accrual has stopped, all accrued subjects will be followed 
to 12 months, and then the inferential tests of non- inferiority will occur 
as described in Sections 9.5 and 9.6.

 1. Introduction  
1.1 Background and Rationale 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 
approximately 2.2 million people in the [LOCATION_002] and 4.5 million in the European Union.
1, 2. The incidence increases with advancing age, affecting 6% of the population 
over age 60 and 10% of the population over age 803, 4. Age -adjusted population 
trending projects [ADDRESS_722180] AF by [ZIP_CODE]. 
AF remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized societies . 
The annual risk of AF -related  stroke is 5% per year and 1 of every 6 strokes diagnosed 
occurs in the presence of AF.6 Therefore, patients with AF require long -term 
anticoagulation to prevent embolic events. Failure to manage AF may also lead to anatomic and electrical remodeling of the left atrium  (LA) , tachycardia-induced 
cardiomyopathy and reduced left ventricular function (heart failure). AF remains an extremely costly public health burden, with annual per patient cost of care approaching €3000 (approximately $3,200 U.S. )
7  
The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) 2017 Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation
8 defines several different stages of AF . Paroxysmal AF 
(PAF) is defined as AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days of onset.  
1.2 Irreversible Electroporation  
Al-Sakere 2007
9 described irreversible electroporation  (IRE) as a non -thermal tissue 
ablation technique in which intense short duration electrical fields are used to permanently open pores in cell membranes, thus producing non- thermal tissue ablation . 
Their study, using a mouse model, showed complete regression in 92% of treated tumors . IRE ablation has a tissue- specific mechanism of ablation . The tissue injury 
from IRE ablation occurs at the cellular level with loss of homeostasis leading to necrosis or apoptosis.
10, 11, 12, 13 IRE ablation typi[INVESTIGATOR_550263] , 
which facilitates  rapid wound healing.14, 15, 16, 17, 18 
Thomson 201119 reported a case -series study (N=38) assessing the safety of IRE for 
treating liver, kidney or lung cancers in humans. The first four patients showed signs of 
transient ventricular arrhythmia, so subsequent patients were all treated using electrocardiogram (ECG )-synchronized delivery of electroporation pulses. There were 
2 further arrhythmias  and 2 cases of inadvertent damage to neighboring organs . 
Approximately 68% of tumors were completely ablated . The authors concluded that 
IRE is safe for clinical use, provided  ECG-synchronized delivery is used.  
A research group led by [CONTACT_550315][INVESTIGATOR_550264] . Wittkampf 2011
20 (N=10) used a circular ablation catheter and showed 
that PVI was achieved in all animals, with no sign of stenosis at 3 -week follow-up. 
Van Driel 201421 (N=6) confirmed this result out to 3-month follow-up. Neven 201422 
(N=5) showed that electroporation lesion depth depended on the level of electrical energy applied, reaching 8 mm at 300 joules. 
FARAPULSE  ADVENT  TRIAL  OCTOBER 13, 2021 
CS0934,  REVISION D  PAGE 19 
 Van Driel 201523 (N=20) showed that electroporation could create deep lesions close to 
the phrenic nerve without damage to the nerve. Neven 201424 similarly showed that 
neighboring coronary arteries were undamaged by [CONTACT_151638] (N= 5). These 
animal studies suggest that IRE can safely create deep lesions in heart tissue without harming adjacent tissues . 
1.3 Summary of FARAPULSE Preclinical Studies  
FARAPULSE Inc. (hereinafter FARAPULSE) has performed multiple preclinical animal studies investigating the safety and efficacy of the FARAPULSE ™ Pulsed 
Field Ablation System . These studies demonstrate that pulsed field ablation (PFA) 
using the FARAPULSE technology reliably produces homogeneous, well- demarcated 
and transmural lesions in porcine atrial tissue. Seven - and 30-day studies show mild to 
moderate inflammatory and healing responses consistent with radiofrequency ablation lesions.  
Areas of critical interest that cannot be directly assessed in the clinical studies perform ed to date include:  
• Esophageal S paring : FARAPULSE performed a preclinical study
[ADDRESS_722181] of PFA application on the esophagus in a relevant preclinical porcine model. A cohort of swine underwent ablation of the esophagus, which was mechanically deflected to be in close apposition with the inferior vena cava 
(IVC) which contained the PFA catheter.  A control cohort, which underwent 
clinically representative radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was also assessed.  After 
a high- dose delivery of the PFA and RFA energies, the animal subjects were 
survived to 25 days.  
Pathological analysis demonstrated that no PFA subjects showed any gross or 
histological sign of ablation -related injury  to the esophageal tissues. However, 
all RF control subjects showed ablation- related injury  to the esophagus , ranging 
from mucosal lesions to esophageal fistula.  
• Phrenic Nerve Sparing : FARAPULSE performed a preclinical study
26 to 
assess the safety and efficacy of the PFA waveform  directly adjacent to the 
phrenic nerve. Right superior pulmonary vein ( RSPV ), inferior common 
pulmonary vein (IC PV) and  superior vena cava ( SVC) isolation were performed 
using the FARAWAVE Pulsed Field Ablation C atheter in a relevant preclinical 
porcine model.  
None of eleven porcine subjects showed any diminution of phrenic nerve 
function after treatment at the maximum (2.0  kV) and minimum (1.4  kV) 
voltages under investigation. 
• Pulmonary Vein Effects : FARAPULSE performed a preclinical study27 to 
assess the safety and efficacy of ablation using the F ARAWAVE Pulsed Field 
Ablation C atheter  in a relevant preclinical porcine model.  Six porcine subjects 
underwent ablation of the RSPV and ICPV at 2.0 kV and were then survived for 30 days.  
FARAPULSE  ADVENT  TRIAL  OCTOBER 13, 2021 
CS0934,  REVISION D  PAGE 20 
 Pathological analysis demonstrated that no subjects showed any degree of PV 
narrowing or flow impairment in the treated veins.  This study also investigated 
durability of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and histological transmurality  at 30 
days, showing that both assessments were present in 91.6% of the treated PVs. 
These results support the safety and performance of the system.  
1.4 Summary of FARAPULSE Clinical Studies  for PAF  
1.4.1 The IMPULSE  Study  
FARAPULSE, Inc. conducted a safety and feasibility study28 at Na Homolce Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_550265], Czech Republic and Hôpi[INVESTIGATOR_550266]- Leveque in Pessac, 
[LOCATION_009] under the “IMPULSE” Protocol, CS0188. This study was conducted using a 
version of the FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation System  which functioned 
similarly to the system which will be used in the IDE investigation  and the results are 
summarized below .  
Clinical investigation population : Adult patients with PAF  who provided informed 
consent to participate in the study.  
Methodology: In this pre -market, multi -center study, subjects who had signed the 
informed consent underwent baseline assessment, received treatment with the 
investigational device and were assessed prior to discharge, and at 30 days, 3 months, 
6 months and  12 months following the  index procedure. A remappi[INVESTIGATOR_550267] 3-month assessment . A core laboratory analyzed ECG data 
from the Event Monitors (EM s) and H olter monitors. Adverse events (AEs) were 
reviewed  and where necessary adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee (CEC) . 
Results: A total of 40 subjects enrolled and were treated in this study with a mean age of 58.2±9.1 years. A majority of subjects were male, 70% (28/40).  
The primary safety endpoint of the study was the incidence of early- onset (within 7 
days of the PFA ablation procedure) primary adverse events (AEs). One subject had a 
qualifying peri-procedural cardiac tamponade resolving with drainage, for a rate of 2.5% (1/40).  
The primary feasibility endpoint of the study was the proportion of subjects that 
achieved Acute P rocedural S uccess, defined as the percutaneous endocardial creation 
of electrically isolating lesions around the ostia of the PV s using the FARAPULSE 
Pulsed Field Ablation System.  The procedural success rate was 100% (40/40).  
Secondary safety endpoints, included the rate of all serious adverse events ( SAEs ) 
reported at the different follow -up time points, as adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741], with 7.5% 
(3/40) of subjects reporting an SAE between index procedure and 30 days (2 AF events, 1 cardiac tamponade), 0.0% (0/40) of subjects reporting an SAE between 30 days and 3 months, 7.5% (3/40) of subjects reporting an SAE between 3 months and 6 months (1 a rteriovenous fistula, 2 AT s) and 2.5% (1/40) of subjects reporting an 
SAE between 6 months and 12 months (1 urinary calculus).   
FARAPULSE  ADVENT  TRIAL  OCTOBER 13, 2021 
CS0934,  REVISION D  PAGE 21 
 No pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) , esophageal lesions or phrenic nerve impairment 
was observed in any subject. 
The secondary feasibility endpoint was long- term technical success, defined as 
electrical isolation of the PVs assessed during an electroanatomical mappi[INVESTIGATOR_550268] 3-months following the index procedure, with 41.2% (1 4/34) of 
subjects achieving technical success.   
For the 40 enrolled subjects, 156 veins were treated at the index procedure, 100% 
(156/156) were successfully isolated and 70% of ablated PVs remained isolated at the 
3-month remappi[INVESTIGATOR_124502] . Thirty -one (3 1) of 40 subjects (77.5%) remain ed free 
from post-blanking AF, atrial flutter (AFL ) or atrial tachycardia ( AT) after a mean 
follow -up of 356 days. 
Ten ( 10) device deficiencies were reported in [ADDRESS_722182] resolved with several others under ongoing investigation. 
Conclusion: These results support the safety and feasibility of the FARAPULSE 
Pulsed Field Ablation  System in the treatment of patients with PAF, with a low rate 
of primary AEs through 7 days, a high rate (100%) of procedural success and a rate of 
arrhythmia recurrence consistent with other technologies.  
1.4.2 The PEFCAT Study  
FARAPULSE, Inc. has completed enrollment in a two -center  single arm open label 
safety and feasibility study
29 of the treatment of PAF at Na Homolce Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_550269], Czech Republic and Hôpi[INVESTIGATOR_550266]- Leveque in Pessac, 
[LOCATION_009] under the “PEFCAT” Protocol, CS0267. This study was conducted using the 
FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation System, very similar in function to the system 
which will be used in the IDE investigation. 
Clinical investigation population : Subjects with documented drug- resistant 
(Class I to IV) symptomatic PAF who have had ≥ 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_42988] 6 months of 
enrollment.   
Methodology: In this pre -market, multi -center study, subjects who had signed the 
informed consent underwent baseline assessment, received treatment with the 
investigational device and were assessed prior to discharge, and at 30 days, 75 days, 
6 months and 12 months following the  index procedure. A remappi[INVESTIGATOR_550267] 75 -day assessment . A core laboratory analyzed ECG data from 
the EMs and H olter monitors. AEs were reviewed  and where necessary adjudicated 
by [CONTACT_15741]. 
Results: A total of 71 subjects enrolled and were treated in this study with a mean 
age of 57.2±10.5 years . A majority of study subjects were male, 78.9% (56/71).  
FARAPULSE  ADVENT  TRIAL  OCTOBER 13, [ADDRESS_722183] had a pericardial effusion following a protocol- specified remap procedure that included 
PFA, which resolved after drainage. The proportion of subjects with one or more 
composite safety events was 2.8% (2/71).  
The primary feasibility endpoint of the study was A cute Procedural Success, defined 
as the percutaneous endocardial creation of a complete, electrically isolating set of lesions around the ostia of the pulmonary veins (PVs ) using the FARAPULSE Pulsed 
Field Ablation  System during the first procedure, as clinically assessed by [CONTACT_550316]/or exit block performed ≥ [ADDRESS_722184] PVI lesion is made. The procedural success rate was 100% (71/71).  
Secondary safety endpoints included the rate of device or procedure- related SAEs at 
30 days, 75, days, 6 months and 12 months, with reported rates between 0.0% and 
4.2%. Additional secondary safety endpoint results at 12 months included: stroke/CVA (0.0% [ 0/71]), transient ischemic attack (TIA) (0.0% [0/71] ), major 
bleeding related to anticoagulation treatment (0.0% [0/71]), cardioversion (5.6% 
[4/71]) and arrhythmia -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (7.0% [5/71] ). 
No PVS , esophageal lesions or phrenic nerve impairment was observed in any 
subject. 
Chronic Procedural Success (CPS) was defined as persistent electrical isolation of all 
initially ablated PV s assessed during an electroanatomical mappi[INVESTIGATOR_550270] 75 days following the index procedure. The rate of Chronic Procedural Success was found in 74.2% (46/62) of treated and remapped subjects.  
Therapeutic Success was  defined as freedom from post-blanking AF, AFL or AT , or 
post-blanking ablation for AF, AFL or AT  using the study device, or ablation for AF, 
AFL or AT  with a non-study device at any time. The overall rate of Therapeutic 
Success was 67.6% (46/68) ; for subjects taking antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) the rate 
was 51.9% (14/27) and for subjects not taking AADs 78.0% (32/41). 
Sixty -eight (68) of [ADDRESS_722185] Day 90 and as of the cut- off 
date for this analysis 5 4/68 (79.4%) were free from recurrent arrythmia through a 
mean follow -up of 325 days.  
For the 71 enrolled subjects, 279 veins were treated at the index procedure and 100% 
(279/279) were successfully isolated. Of subjects that attended the 75-day remappi[INVESTIGATOR_124502], 90.9% (221/243) were durably isolated.  
Device performance was generally excellent, with [ADDRESS_722186] resolved with several others under ongoing investigation.

 Conclusion: These results support the safety and feasibility of the FARAPULSE 
Pulsed Field Ablation  System in the treatment of patients with PAF, with a low rate 
of acute and long-term primary safety endpoint events and a high rate (100%) of 
procedural success. 
1.4.3 The PEFCAT II Study  
FARAPULSE has completed enrollment in  the multicenter, single arm open label 
PEFCAT II expanded safety and feasibility study30 of the FARAPULSE Pulsed Field 
Ablation System as well as the FARAFLEX Pulsed Field Ablation  Catheter . Subjects 
were enrolled at both the Na Homolce Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_550271], Czech Republic and the ‘University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_550272] “PEFCAT II” Protocol, CS0571. This study investigated PVI and cavo -tricuspid isthmus ( CTI) ablation using the 
FARAWAVE  and FARAFLEX  Pulsed Field Ablation C atheters . 
Clinical investigation population : Subjects with documented drug- resistant 
(Class I to IV) symptomatic PAF who have had ≥  2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_42988] 6 months of 
enrollment.  
Methodology: In this pre -market, multi -center study, subjects who had signed the 
informed consent underwent baseline assessment, received treatment with the 
investigational device and were assessed prior to discharge, and at 30 days, 75 days, 
6 months and 12 months following the  index procedure. A remappi[INVESTIGATOR_550267] 75 -day assessment . A core laboratory analyzed ECG data from 
the EMs and H olter monitors. AE s were reviewed  and where necessary adjudicated 
by [CONTACT_15741]. 
Results: A total of 10 subjects enrolled and were treated in this study with a mean 
age of 56.0±14.2 years . There was equal number of males 50.0% (5/10) and females 
50% (5/10).  
The primary safety endpoint of the study was a CSE including early -onset and late-
onset events . No primary events occurred giving a rate of 0.0% (0/10).  
The primary feasibility endpoint of the study was acute procedural success, defined as 
above. The procedural success rate was 100% (10/10).  
Secondary safety endpoints included the rate of device or procedure- related SAEs, 
stroke, cardioversion and arrhythmia- related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] . The rates of these 
events were 0.0% (0/10). CPS – defined as persistent electrical isolation of all initially ablated PV s – was found 
in 77.8% (7/9) of subjects.  
Acute CTI Success – defined as the creation of bi- directional electrical block across 
the cavotricuspid isthmus – was found in 100% (4/4) of subjects undergoing CTI 
ablation. 
Therapeutic Success – defined as freedom from occurrence of AF, AFL or AT, or 
post-blanking ablation for AF, AFL or AT  using the study device, or  ablation for AF, 
AFL or AT  with a non-study device at any time – was 80.0% (8/10), 0.0% (0/1) in 
FARAPULSE  ADVENT  TRIAL  OCTOBER 13, 2021 
CS0934,  REVISION D  PAGE 24 
 subjects on AADs  and 88.9% (8/9) in subjects off A ADs, at a mean follow -up of 200 
days. 
For the 10 enrolled subjects, 39 veins were treated at the index procedure and 100% 
(39/39) were successfully isolated . For subjects that underwent the 75-day remappi[INVESTIGATOR_223117], 94.3% (33/35) of treated PVs were durably isolated. 
There have been no device deficiencies reported for this study through the analysis date.  
Conclusion: These results support the safety and feasibility of the FARAPULSE 
Pulsed Field Ablation System in the treatment of patients with PAF , with a rate of 
0.0% for acute and long- term primary safety endpoint events  and a high rate (100%) 
of procedural success.  
1.4.4 Clinical Sub -Studies  
Several investigator- initiated sub- studies were undertaken during the clinical 
investigations cited above.  
• Esophageal Assessment : Thirty -eight (38) subject s enrolled in the PEFCAT 
study underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy following ablation using the FARAWAVE Pulsed Field Ablation Catheter to isolate all PVs .
31  
None (0%) of these studies revealed any ablation -related findings.  
In another study of imaged PVs, Cochet et al compare post -procedure lesion 
imaging from subjects receiving FARAPULSE PFA, radiofrequency and cryoballoon ablation for PVI . Consistent with its underlying mechanism, 
FARAPULSE PFA demonstrated no gadolinium enhancement of the esophagus 
suggestive of injury (0/18 subjects). Radiofrequency (6/16 subjects) and cryoballoon (4/7 subjects ) ablation did create signals for esophageal injury on 
magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ).
32 
Phrenic Nerve Assessment : An analysis of the first [ADDRESS_722187] Pulsed Field Ablation Catheter  showed 100% of treated veins were isolated acutely . Pre- and post-
ablation phrenic functional testing was performed either by [CONTACT_550317][INVESTIGATOR_550273].  
No subject  (0% , 0/117) showed any diminution of phrenic function.
33 
• Pulmonary Vein Morphology:  Data regarding baseline and 3 -month computed 
tomography ( CT) imaging from IMPULSE and PEFCAT (PFA ablated PVs) 
and TOCCASTAR and HEARTLIGHT ( control subjects with RF ablated PVs) 
was re-analyzed and compared.34 
A total of 303 PVs showed that the average percent change in PV ostial 
diameters was reduced significantly more in RF subjects compared with PFA subjects (p < 0.001). When analyzed in standardized percentile change

 categories, the distribution of size changes was significantly worse in RF -
treated PVs compared with PF- treated PVs (p < 0.001).

and PEFCAT studies have undergone peri-procedural post- ablation brain MRI 
scans to assess for silent cerebral events ( SCEs) and/or silent cerebral lesions 
(SCLs).  
Two of these subject s (2/18, 11%) showed diffusion-weighted positive lesions 
(SCEs) at approximately one day post procedure. One of these subjects, with a 
prior history of TIA, experienced a possible TIA one day post procedure 
presenting as a complaint of 15 minutes of difficulty speaking that was inapparent to observing medical staff ; this event was captured in the AE  dataset

 1.6 Risks, Benefits and Mitigation  
1.6.1 Potential Risks  
As detailed in Section 1.4 , the risk profile associated with the FARAPULSE Pulsed 
Field Ablation System and the ablation procedure is expected to be consistent with 
similar devices currently in clinical use for percutaneous cardiac ablation for treatment of PAF .  
The FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation System  utilizes PFA  to produce continuous 
transmural cardiac lesions to treat AF  using an ablation procedure that is similar to 
other commercially available percutaneous ablation catheters. More specifically:  
• The device system is used during percutaneous endocardial ablation procedures 
like other commercially approved catheter systems.  
• The device system is composed of similar biocompatible materials.  
• The device uses standard percutaneous techniques for ablation procedures.  
• The device utilizes a specialized generator to deliver ablation energy.  
• The device has similar procedural properties as compared to the planned 
commercially approved control devices: 
o The device is similar to CBA devices in that it circumferentially ablate s an 
entire PV  during each delivery  
o The device can be manipulated in the same manner as RF A and CBA 
catheters  
o The device uses metal electrodes for ablation energy delivery (RF 
catheters) and sensing  (RFA and CBA catheters.)  
A difference between the FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation System  and other 
commercially approved thermal AF  ablation systems is that PFA  uses non- thermal IRE 
energy for tissue ablation, delivered through electrodes embedded in the FARAPULSE 
Pulsed Field Ablation Catheter for delivery of such energy in the PV s. 
Based on the available preclinical and clin ical data  and the substantial similarities to 
other approved ablation technologies , the anticipated risks are generally equivalent in 
type, severity and frequency to those associated with commercially released systems being used for percutaneous cardiac ablation procedures.  
1.6.[ADDRESS_722190] the following potential  benefits: 
• To provide treatment to subjects with PAF using an investigational device 
which has demonstrated the ability to isolate PV s endocardially , to reduce the 
subsequent occurrence of symptomatic AF in treated subjects and potentially to 
reduce the risk for severe ablation complications associated with thermal 
ablation such as phrenic nerve palsy or atrio- esophageal fistula. 
FARAPULSE  ADVENT  TRIAL  OCTOBER 13, 2021 
CS0934,  REVISION D  PAGE 27 
 • To provide information gained from the conduct of this study that may benefit 
other persons with the same medical condition.  
• To generate additional data demonstrating that the endocardial creation of 
electrically isolating lesions via PFA  applied using the FARAPULSE Pulsed 
Field Ablation System is a safe and effective treatment for drug -resistant, 
recurrent, symptomatic PAF. 
1.6.[ADDRESS_722191] designation, the FDA was required to find that 
FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation System: 
“… offers significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives, 
including the potential, compared to existing approved alternatives, to reduce or eliminate the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], improve patient quality of life, facilitate patients’  ability to manage their own care (such as through self-directed 
personal assistance), or establish long -term clinical efficiencies.”  
Based on the Sponsor’s evaluation of the investigational devices and their performance and the design of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_550275], the Sponsor has conducted an analysis of the benefits and risks of the FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation System  for the 
treatment of PAF. The conclusion of this review is that this investigation is justified 
because the overall potential benefit to the population outweighs the risks and foreseeable risks which have been mitigated  as fully described in this submission .

FARAPULSE  ADVENT  TRIAL  OCTOBER 13, [ADDRESS_722215]  (IRB)-approved informed consent form ( ICF) / electronic informed consent form 
(eICF ) before undergoing any study-related procedures. If electronic consent is utilized 
it will conform to the FDA Guidance Document “Use of Electronic Informed Consent, 
Questions and Answers”, dated December 2016 (or subsequent revised versions as applicable). 
Since it may become necessary during this study to access study -specific protected 
healthcare information from remote clinical sites, the ICF  / eICF will include this 
permission in the consent process.  
Subjects cannot be asked to sign the ICF  / eICF until the study has been fully approved 
by [CONTACT_8236]’s IRB and the Sponsor or their clinical research organization (CRO) 
representative has received and reviewed the IRB -approved ICF  / eICF . Subjects who 
meet the general eligibility criteria will be asked to sign an ICF  / eICF as approved by 
[CONTACT_550322] -specific tests or procedures are 
performed.  
The Investigator or a designated member of their staff should communicate with the 
subject to obtain written informed consent. As far as possible, non- technical language 
shall be used that is understandable to the subject. The background of the proposed 
study and the benefits and risks of the procedures and study should be explained. The subject should be provided with ample time to read the ICF  / eICF and discuss it with 
their family and physician. The subject shall be informed that their participation in the clinical investigation is confidential. The ICF  / eICF must be read and understood by 
[CONTACT_453220]’s questions answered. The ICF / eICF must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_550323] / designee overseeing informed consent prior to subject enrollment and before the subject undergoes any study -related procedures. All 
subjects are to receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_550277]  / eICF . A copy of the 
approved ICF  / eICF  along with a copy of each subject ’s signed ICF  / eICF  will be  
maintained by [CONTACT_37888] a designated clinical study administrative file  or 
electronic record system . Subjects may not be consented after receiving any medication 
that might alter their ability to comprehend the consent form ( e.g., sedatives, narcotics, 
etc.). Study personnel should explain that even if a subject agrees to participate in the study and signs the ICF / eICF , the subject may not be eligible to participate if the 
subject fails to meet the screening criteria.  
Written informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol-driven tests or any procedures that are not standard of care for a percutaneous ablation procedure that the subject is scheduled to undergo. Once written consent has been obtained, the subject will be entered on a Screening Log, which will be maintained at each site. All subjects who provide written informed consent will be entered into  the 
Screening Log regardless of whether they are enrolled in the study.

If one or more of the required pre -en
 rollment assessments – including cardiac CT/MRI, 
transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE), laboratory tests and ECG  – have not been 
obtained prior  to signing the ICF, then the enrollment is considered provisional until 
that assessment has been obtained and the criteria met.  
Regardless of the sequence of ICF completion and pre-procedural enrollment assess
ments, if study eligibility  criteria are not met , the subject is  a Screen Failure and 
is not enrolled. 
Study eligibility criteria are determined at the time of study entry. In the instance that 
information received after an Index Procedure / Rescheduled Index Procedure reveals that an inclusion or exclusion criterion – determined prior to the Index Procedure / 
Rescheduled Index Procedure to have been met – is found to have been incorrectly assessed, this does not change the enrolled status of the subject, who remains in the study. 
Each Enrolled Subject will be assigned a unique study identification code to protect 
each subject’s confidential health information. The unique study identification code will not include date of birth or subject’s first and last initials and will be used to link study data and other study information to the subject in lieu of the subject name. The Subject Name [CONTACT_550361]. This log will remain confidential and will not be provided 
to the Sponsor but only used for reference when monitoring at the study site.

Subjects excluding Roll -In Subjects – who are determined by [CONTACT_550324] -randomization inclusion and exclusion criteria , 
who have sign ed an ICF and who are scheduled for the Index Procedure – will be 
randomized. The study staff will confirm documented inclusion / exclusion success prior to requesting randomization.  
3.[ADDRESS_722218] medical care and a study termination/exit CRF will be completed, including the reason for exit.

of care ablation with force -sensing RF catheters and cryoballoon catheters indicated for 
the treatment of PAF. Subjects will undergo ablation for PVI with the randomized 
treatment and if indicated CTI ablation using an RF catheter . Subjects will be followed 
at 7 days (telephonic), [ADDRESS_722220]’s medical information . Subject names 
will not be captured on the CRFs . All subject identifiers except the unique 
pseudo-anonymous identifier should be redacted from any images or other data submitted from the participating site to the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designated reviewers for analysis.  All information concerning subjects or their participation in this 
study will be considered confidential. Only the authorized Sponsor, designated representative personnel, designated consultants and regulatory agencies will have access to these confidential files. 
 
4.4 Sample Size  Summary  
A maximum of 900 subjects may be enrolled in this study. 
Roll-In Subjects : Up to 105 subjects (the first 1  to 3 E nrolled S ubjects at each site ) 
will be treated with the FARAPULSE device s in a manner consistent with the 
randomized Pulsed Field Group and will be analyzed  and reported separately.  
ITT Subjects : An estimated 450 MITT Subjects will be required to support the 
proposed non- inferiority outcomes.  Interim sample size re -estimation may decrease this 
number to 350 or increase it to a maximum of 750. Up to 45 additional subjects (6%) 
may be enrolled to compensate for those ITT Subjects who do not meet the criteria for the MITT Population.

CS0934,  REVISION D  PAGE 44 
 4.5 Investigational Sites  
The clinical study will be conducted at up to 35 qualified investigational sites in the 
[LOCATION_002]. No site may enroll more than 45 ITT Subjects (excludes Roll -In Subjects 
and ITT Subjects who do not qualify for the MITT population) with an intended minimum of 10 subjects per site. Should interim sample size re -estimation lead to an 
increase in the number of MITT Subjects greater than 450, each site will be limited to 10% of the increased total.  
4.[ADDRESS_722221] 600 subjects (105 Roll-Ins plus 495 ITT Subjects) is estimated to take 1 8 months and subjects will be followed for up to 13 
months. There will be a 3-month period of site close-out visits, for a planned study duration of approximately 40 months. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)- related 
disruptions and interim sample size re -estimation may alter this timeframe.  
Subject participation is anticipated to be 13 ± 1 months to allow for screening, pre-
procedural diagnostic procedures, randomization, treatment and 12±[ADDRESS_722222] requires a Rescheduled Index Procedure, this may prolong 
participation by [CONTACT_8622] 2 to 3 months. 
4.7 Schedule  of Events and Assessments  
Subjects will complete the following visits and assessments as indicated below and as summarized in Table 3, (ITT Subjects) and Table 4, (Roll- In Subjects).  
Assessments that are stipulated as r emote may also be performed in -person at the 
investigational site at the Investigator’s discretion with subject agreement.  
All protocol -stipulated assessments below will be entered into the appropriate CRF s. 
Assessments are to be performed within the specified assessment windows.  
When COVID-19-related disruptions ( Section  6.3.8) interfere with the performance of 
protocol- stipulated follow -up assessments, study sites and Sponsor personnel will 
adjust procedures to optimize data acquisition while protecting the health, safety and 
welfare of all study participants. Study subjects , sites, IRBs and the FDA  will be 
informed of COVID-19- related changes in the study.  
This protocol does not specify how remote assessments should be performed, but these will be specified in related study documentation and may be modified as necessary during the conduct of the study. The method(s) used during the course of this study to interact with study participants and to acquire data remotely will be consistent with relevant FDA Guidance Documents and will be reported in the Clinical Study Report.

4.7.12 COVID- 19-Related Disruption of Study Assessments  
To avoid study disruptions or missing data related to COVID -19 impacts, such as 
COVID-19 illness or COVID-19 restrictions on movement, association or access to health care facilities, every effort will be made to gather study data by  [CONTACT_550327]. This includes use of communications media and 
the acquisition of health- related information from other health care facilities and 
providers. 
Telephonic and telemedicine assessments may be used. Important considerations for  
study visits through video conferencing include: 
• The Investigator or study personnel who will conduct remote visits should be 
trained on how to conduct telemedicine video conferencing visits. 
• Procedures should be put in place to maintain a study subject ’s privacy, as 
would be done for a clinical visit. 
• Both the Investigator and the study subject should confirm their respective 
identities with one another before engaging in a real- time video conference visit 
according to an identity verification plan developed by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The date and time of the real -time video interaction, the location of the study subject 
and the location of the Investigator or personnel conducting the remote visit should be documented in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
Every effort will be made to gather all available study data within the visit window, but if that is not possible data will be gathered outside of the visit window.  
Critical assessments to receive priority include:  
• Occurrence and characterization of AE s 
• Symptoms of arrhythmia recurrence  
• Cardiac CT or MRI scans 
• Brain MRIs  
• Follow-up a ssessment s of phrenic nerve function 
• Event monitoring 
• Holter monitoring  
For all such COVID-19- related missed or out of window assessments, specific 
information will be captured that explains the basis of the missing data and its relation to COVID-19 for missing information (e.g., from missed visits or subject discontinuations)

 4.10 Control of Systematic Error and Bias 
Subjects will be  randomized in this controlled study and key evaluators (CEC , 
Arrhythmia Core Laboratory [ ACL ] and Cardiac Imaging Core Laboratory [ CICL ]) for 
primary and secondary outcome assessments will be blinded.  
Error and bias are controlled by [CONTACT_550328], including a comprehensive set of 
study procedures as defined in the protocol which  ensure consistent management , site 
and data monitoring and outcome measure assessment. Follow -up Holter monitoring 
and event monitoring data, and all MRI/CT dimensions of PVs, will be assessed objectively and without knowledge of subject treatment status by [CONTACT_550329]. SAEs and the primary effectiveness and safety outcomes will be reviewed by [CONTACT_15731] ( Section  12.2.4).  
A complete Clinical Study Report and dataset will allow scientific and clinical reviewers to independently assess potential error and bias.

 5. Study Procedures  
5.1 Anticoagulation 
Anticoagulation will be guided by [CONTACT_941] 2017 Heart Rhythm Society  Expert Consensus 
Statement8 and the 2019 American Heart Association  / American College of 
Cardiology / Heart Rhythm Society Focused Update36 relating to this issue.  
Adjustments  for subject welfare may be made by [CONTACT_10670] s based on clinical 
judgment and do not constitute protocol deviations. 
Throughout the study:  
• Subjects with a CHA 2DS 2-VASc score ≥ 2 (men) or ≥ 3 (women) should receive 
oral anticoagulants throughout the study.  
• NOACs are recommended over warfarin for eligible subjects.  
• Subjects on warfarin should have at least monthly INR assessment.  
Peri-procedural:  
• Non-anticoagulated s ubjects will  be placed on therapeutic anticoagulation for a 
minimum of 3 weeks prior to an ablation procedure regardless of baseline 
CHA 2DS 2-VASc score. 
• Subjects taking warfarin should continue warfarin through the procedure. 
• Subjects taking a NOAC should have either continued NOAC (rivaroxaban) or a single dose interruption in NOAC with a restart shortly after the procedure , at 
Investigator discretion . 
• A heparin bolus will be delivered prior to or immediately following transseptal 
puncture. Procedural activated clotting times ( ACTs ) will be sampled regularly 
throughout the procedure and maintained at a minimum of [ADDRESS_722244]-ablation: 
• If the subject is not otherwise indicated for anticoagulation, suitable anticoagulation will be maintained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_722245]’s stroke risk and bleeding risk profiles.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_722246] will be rescheduled under the procedure defined in  Section 5.3. 
Subjects will undergo sedation / anesthesia according to institutional protocol. They 
will then be prepared in conventional sterile fashion for a cardiac catheterization procedure.  
Femoral vein access will be obtained via Seldinger technique.   
FARAPULSE  ADVENT  TRIAL  OCTOBER 13, 2021 
CS0934,  REVISION D  PAGE 59 
 Use of ultrasound guidance is recommended, but not required, for femoral venous 
access.  
A heparin bolus will be delivered prior to or immediately after transseptal puncture. 
Procedural ACTs will be regularly monitored and maintained at a minimum of 300 
seconds. 
Commercially approved diagnostic catheters may be placed before or after transseptal 
access is established at the Investigator’s discretion. Transseptal access to the LA will 
be obtained using commercially approved devices, establishing guidewire access to 
the LA . 
TEE within [ADDRESS_722247] s:  
The use of ICE is required for Pulsed Field Ablation procedures.  
The FARADRIVE Steerable Sheath will be prepared and advanced via guidewire to 
the LA . 
Esophageal temperature monitoring, esophageal cooling and esophageal deviation are 
unnecessary during ablation with the FARAWAVE Pulsed Field Ablation Catheter 
and should not be utilized. 
The FARAWAVE Pulsed Field Ablation Catheter  will then be prepared and 
advanced to the LA through the FARADRIVE Steerable Sheath . After confirming an 
ACT of 300 or greater, ablation of the PVs to achieve isolation will be performed according to the approved IFU  documents and institutional practice.
Ablation will be attempted in every clinically relevant PV, including any vein with an 
active muscular sleeve. Small anomalous PVs that are electrically silent need not be 
attempted.  
PVI ablation may be repeated at the Investigator’s  discretion. Each addressable PV 
will be ablated in turn. The isolating effect of the PVI ablation(s) will be checked periodically and then finally twenty (20) minutes after the last PVI ablation. 
Adenosine may be used for the final assessment but is not required. 
 
 At the conclusion of the PVI ablation procedure, the FARAWAVE Pulsed Field 
Ablation Catheter will  be undeployed and withdrawn from the FARADRIVE 
Steerable Sheath .  
The functional status of both phrenic nerves will be assessed before the study is 
concluded. 
Thermal Subject s:  
All Investigators at a given site must use only 1 of the 2 categories of Thermal Group 
technology for ablation, either a force-sensing irrigated RF A catheter or a CBA 
catheter, indicated for the treatment of PAF. A site’s Thermal Group technology will 
be determined prior to the initiation of enrollment at that site and maintained without 
exception throughout the study. 
A commercial ly approved sheath will be prepared and advanced via guidewire to the 
LA. Commercially approved diagnostic catheters may be placed via conventional 
technique at the Investigator’s discretion. A baseline 3D electroanatomical map may 
also be made at the Investigator ’s discretion.  
Esophageal protection (temperature monitoring, deviation or cooling) us ing the site’s  
customary method is required, unless subject welfare precludes such usage. 
The site’s predetermined technology ablation catheter will be prepared and advanced 
to the LA  through the sheath. Ablation of the PVs to achieve isolation will be 
performed according to the approved IFU  documents and institutional practice.  
Ablation will be attempted in every clinically relevant PV, including any vein with an 
active muscular sleeve. Small anomalous PVs that are electrically silent need not be 
attempted.  
PVI ablation may be repeated at the Investigator’s  discretion. The isolating effect of 
the PVI ablation(s) will be checked periodically and then finally twenty (20) minutes after the last PVI ablation. Adenosine may be used for the final assessment but is not required.  
At the conclusion of the PVI ablation procedure, the ablation catheter should be 
withdrawn from the sheath according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  
The functional status of both phrenic nerves will be assessed before the study is concluded. 
All Subjects:  
CTI ablation : Ablation of the CTI may be performed in both Pulsed Field Subjects and 
Thermal Group S ubjects using any approved catheter in subjects with a past history of 
cavo -tricuspid isthmus -mediated (typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) AFL , subjects who manifest typi[INVESTIGATOR_550290] a procedure or within the Blanking Period, or subjects who have inducible typi[INVESTIGATOR_382868].  Bidirectional block should be demonstrated after the last CTI ablation.  
 
 The CTI ablation data will be documented in the CRF and does not constitute a 
Treatment Failure . 
Other Ablation : O ther ablation is not permitted under this protocol except  when the 
Investigator determines that subject welfare requires ablation for an accessory pathway , 
AVNRT, treatment- emergent left AFL  or incessant AT , using any approved ablation 
catheter . This decision and the associated ablation data will be documented in the CRF 
and does not constitute a Treatment Failure. 
5.[ADDRESS_722248] their Index 
Procedure rescheduled to allow treatment of the thrombus, including a minimum of 3 weeks of continuous therapeutic anticoagulation consistent with Section 5.1. The 
Reschedule Index Procedure will follow the requirements of Section  5.2. 
This rescheduling is permissible and does not create an Acute Procedural Failure. For adjustment of follow -up assessments please see Section  5.5 below. References to 
“Index Procedure” in this protocol should be assumed when appropriate to include “Rescheduled Index Procedure” as well if not otherwise specified.  
5.4 Re-Ablation Procedure s 
Re-ablation under this protocol requires documentation of Detectable AF, AFL or AT. When performed, re- ablation will be performed utilizing a n FDA-approved study 
ablation catheter (RFA or CBA) at Investigator discretion.  
Any re -
ablation procedure for AF, AFL or AT  any time during study follow-up 
constitutes a Treatment Failure . 
 
However, CTI ablation or re-ablation for right-sided typi[INVESTIGATOR_550291]-up and does not constitute a Treatment Failure .  
 
Cardiac imaging: 
• For anticipated PVI re -ablations occurring Day 1-75, pre-procedural imaging is not 
required.  
• For anticipated PVI re -ablations scheduled for Day 76 or later, ensure the Day 90 
cardiac MRI/CT is performed before re- ablation  to assess the dimensions of the 
PVs. The Cardiac CT or MRI scan must be of the same type as the baseline scan 
obtained prior to the Index / Rescheduled Index Procedure. 
 
TEE within 48 hours of the procedure or ICE during the procedure will be utilized prior 
to transseptal puncture for exclusion of LA thrombus. If the study reveals atrial 
thrombus, the investigational procedure will not begin or will be terminated  and no 
ablation will be performed.  
 
 
 Re-ablation does not reset the Blanking Period or otherwise alter the Schedule of 
Events and Assessments ( Section  4.7). 
Remappi[INVESTIGATOR_456130]:  
• During any re- ablation procedure in which LA access is performed : 
o Sufficient mappi[INVESTIGATOR_550292].  
• During any re-ablation procedure in a subject who underwent CTI: 
o Sufficient mappi[INVESTIGATOR_550293] a previously treated CTI.  
5.5 Start Date, Blanking Period and Index Procedures  
The day of the Index Procedure or Rescheduled Index Procedure is the Start Date (Day  0) for follow -up scheduling. The Blanking Period consists of a subject’s Day 0 
through and including Day 90. During the Blanking Period, any oc currence of 
Detectable AF, AFL or AT  will be documented; however, occurrences of AF, AFL or 
AT during this time will not be considered Treatment Failure s.  
For subjects who undergo ablation at the Index Procedure, the follow- up intervals for 
safety and effectiveness are depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 9 below: 
Figure 9 Index Procedure Blanking and Follow -Up Intervals  
 
For subjects who undergo ablation at a Rescheduled Index Procedure the follow-up intervals for safety and effectiveness are depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 10  below. The follow -up 
intervals for effectiveness and safety are still based on the day of the ablation procedure (Day 0) . Pre-ablation AE s that occur between the Index Procedure and the day before 
the Rescheduled Index Procedure will not be included in the safety analyses, but will be documented and reported separately, with the day of occurrence being enumerated from the day of the Index Procedure that was deferred.

5.7 Blinding  
• I nvestigators : The treating physicians and site -based study personnel are 
necessarily exposed to a subject’s treatment assignment and cannot be blinded. 
As much as possible, site based study personnel who perform follow- up 
evaluations will remain blinded to subject treatment assignment.  

 
 • S ubjects: Study personnel will be trained to avoid disclosing treatment status to 
study subjects. Study subjects will sign an informed consent that states that they 
will not be informed of their treatment status until the conclusion of their participation in the s tudy. 
• Core Laboratories: The ACL, CICL and Brain Imaging Core Lab (BICL) will 
remain blinded to treatment assignment throughout the study duration. 
• CEC: The CEC will remain blinded as much as possible consistent with accurate 
adjudication.  
• Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DS MB) : In general, the DSMB will review 
unblinded results in order to perform their function of protecting the integrity of the study and the rights, safety and welfare of study subjects. 
• Study / CRO staff : M
 onitoring staff will be unblinded to perform their function. 
Other Sponsor and CRO staff will be unblinded on a documented need- to-know 
basis to allow conduct of the study. 
5.8 N eurologic Assessment Subjects  
Neurologic Assessment Subjects (NAS) are a subset of ITT Subjects who will undergo 
a post-procedural brain MRI following the ablation procedure. 
5.8.[ADDRESS_722251]- ablation will be established and designated as NAS sites. NAS sites will be 
selected to generate a minimum of 80 NAS Subjects, balanced approximately equally between RFA and CBA control sites . Total NAS enrollment will be limited to a 
maximum of 40 subjects in the PFA group and 40 subjects in the Thermal Group (RFA/CBA). 
• An approximately equal number of RF-control sites and cryoballoon- control sites 
will be targeted . 
• All ITT Subjects at NAS sites free of contraindications to MRI will be consented 
for post- procedure MRI until the study enrollment target of evaluable scans is 
met. 
• Roll-In Subjects are excluded  from participation in the NAS.  
5.8.[ADDRESS_722252]-Ablation Brain MRI Specifications  for NAS Subjects Only  
These specification are for the protocol -r
 equired brain MRIs of NAS Subjects only. 
• Standards and Quality Control: The BICL will establish specific standards for 
brain MRI performance, train participating sites and interact with sites to ensure 
that standards and scan quality remain within specification. 
• Timing :  Post index procedure (between [ADDRESS_722253]- ablation ) brain 
MRIs will be performed on each NAS subject . 
• Parameters:  The following scan parameters will be used: 
o 1.5-T scanners  
o 5mm slice thicknesses  
o DWI, FLAIR and ADC assessed for each scan  
o SCE = DWI + and ADC reduced  
 
 o SCL = DWI + and ADC reduced and FLAIR + 
5.8.3 SCE and SCL Analysis  
The frequency and type of SCE s and SCL s will be reported by [CONTACT_91727], 
along with potential predictor variables including CHA 2DS 2-VASc  status, duration of 
PAF, history of stroke/TIA, procedur e time, LA  dwell time and total ablation time, 
anticoagulation regimen and ACT levels, occurrence of cardioversion or air 
introduction, frequency of LA catheter exchanges and maximal sheath size.  
5.8.4 Follow- Up for Subjects with SCE or SCL Lesions  
• Subjects with a site -confirmed post- procedural SCE or SCL will undergo a 
pre-discharge neurologic assessment as specified in Section 4.7.3. 
• Subjects with a site- confirmed or BICL -confirmed post- procedural SCE or 
SCL will undergo a follow -up brain MRI using the parameters specified in 
Section 5.8.2 during the 90 Day Assessment  window. 
5.9 Antiarrhythmic  Drugs  
AADs , except for amiodarone, may be utilized during the Blanking Period at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  
On Day 60 ± [ADDRESS_722254] will be contact[CONTACT_550311].  
Class I  / III AADs (see Section 6.3.4) should be stopped at the Day 60 Assessment. 
However, a t the Investigator’s discretion, Class I  / III AADs may be continued up to 
Day 90 without creating a Treatment Failure . If AADs are required after Day 90 and 
Class I / III AADs are prescribed, the Investigator should document the reason for 
utilizing the medication in the eCRF.  Notwithstanding the impact on study outcomes, 
the use of Class I / III AADs for subject welfare as determined by [CONTACT_550330]. 
The use of amiodarone at any time during the study, except intra -
 procedurally to 
control an arrhythmia , or the use of Class I / III AADs after Day 90, constitute a 
Treatment Failure.

 9. Statistical Procedures  and Reporting  
A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) governs the analysis and reporting of the 
data from this investigation. This section summarizes the essential elements of that plan.  
9.[ADDRESS_722278] quantitative statistics: number of available observations, mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles and range (minimum and maximum observed values). The number of missing observations will also be reported. C ategorical variables will be 
summarized using classical frequency statistics: number of available observations and percentages by [CONTACT_10611]. Percentages will be calculated on the number of available observations. The number of missing observations will also be specified.  
A full data listing will be prepared. Data will be pooled from all study sites.  All related and resulting reports, documents and data will be produced and maintained 
in such a way as to ensure their control and the protection of subject privacy. Data files and analytic reports will be archived according to requisite regulatory standards.  
Data gathered regarding COVID-19 impacts – including missed, late or alternative 
assessments, COVID-19- related complications , subject withdrawals or Severe COVID-
19 status – will be used as required to address potential biases or to perform sensitivity 
analyses related to the impact of COVID-[ADDRESS_722279]’s participation and/or outcome may have been altered. COVID-19-related deviations to the sche dule, type of assessment and assessment 
windows will be aggregated and reported. 
9.2 Randomization 
Subjects meeting all pre -randomization inclusion and exclusion criteria who sign an 
ICF will be randomized. The study staff will confirm documented inclusion  / exclusion 
success prior to requesting randomization.  Randomization will be achieved by [CONTACT_190331] -based or phone-based system. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_550342] a permuted block design with 
randomly varying block sizes.  Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized using a 1:1 
allocation ratio . 
 
 Each site will utilize only one control modality – either RFA or CBA – and will use 
that modality for all subjects randomized to the Thermal Group. Site activation and 
enrollment will be monitored and when necessary controlled to maintain a minimum 40% proportion of Thermal Subjects in either the RFA or CBA modality. 
9.[ADDRESS_722280] Disposition  
The disposition of all subjects enrolled in the study will be described in tables and diagrams, including numbers screened, randomized, excluded, treated and assessed at each scheduled follow -up interval. Roll -In Subjects will be assessed separately. Severe 
COVID-19 Subjects will be noted and the potential impacts on the study results assessed in sensitivity analyses. Subjects who do not complete the study will be enumerated and the reason(s) for their discontinuation will be described. 
9.[ADDRESS_722281] of non- inferiority of the event rate 
at 12 months using a non- inferiority margin of 8%. The null and alternative hypotheses 
are presented below for primary safety : 
 H
0: Q T ≥ Q C + 0.08 versus H A: Q T < Q C + 0.08 
where Q T is the CSE proportion in the Pulsed Field ( Treatment) Group  and QC is the 
CSE proportion in the Thermal (Control) Group. The differences in the proportion of subjects with 1 or more CSE events between the Pulsed Field Group and the Thermal Group will be tested with a Bayesian statistical method  and the prior distributions for 
Q
T and Q C in these calculations are Beta (0.5, 0.5), which is the Jeffreys non-
informative prior. Q T will be deemed  to be non- inferior to Q C if it can be established 
that the posterior probability Pr(H A | data) > Ψ saf, where Ψ saf is a pre- specified threshold 
value that controls the one -sided type I error rate (under simulation) at level 0.[ADDRESS_722282] of non- inferiority of the event rate at 12 months using a non-
inferiority margin of 15%. The null and alternative hypotheses are: 
 H 0: PT ≤ P C – 0.15 versus H A: PT > P C – 0.15 
where P T is the Treatment Success rate at 12 months in the Pulsed Field Group and P C 
is the Treatment Success rate at 12 months in the Thermal ( Control) Group.  
This study is designed using Bayesian statistical techniques and the prior distributions 
for P T and P C in these calculations are Beta (0.5, 0.5), which is the Jeffreys non-
informative prior. P T will be deemed  to be non- inferior to P C if it can be established that 
the posterior probability Pr(H A | data) > Ψ eff, where Ψ eff is a pre- specified threshold 
value that controls the one -sided type I error rate (under simulation) at level 0.05 . In the 
absence of missing data, the posterior distributions for P T and P C would be conjugate 
Beta distributions . However, some missing data are expected . Therefore, Bayesian 
multiple imputation of 12 -month outcomes will be employed in the principal analysis . 
The imputation model accounts for primary outcome information up through the time 
of censoring. D etails on the modeling for this imputation are given in the SAP. 
9.7 Sample Size Considerations  
Please refer to the SAP for a full treatment of this topic.  
Parameter selection:  IDE pi[INVESTIGATOR_550302] -resistant 
symptomatic PAF are highly standardized and utilize nearly identical definitions of primary effectiveness and similar definitions of primary safety. Published IDE studies  
with available information comparing new devices with approved control devices have all used non- inferiority designs with one -sided alpha of 0.05 and 15% effectiveness 
margins and either 8% or 9% safety margins.  
Peer-reviewed  studies do not undergo the same scrutiny or utilize the rigor of 
FDA- supervised  studies and  therefore their estimates of effectiveness and safety are 
not entirely comparable to IDE  studies. The consensus regarding high quality 
randomized comparisons between currently approved technologies is that none are superior to another. Perhaps the largest  non- IDE study comparing RFA and CBA 
technologies (Fire and Ice
37) found no difference between the two and also reported 
very similar primary outcomes to IDE  studies. 
Sample Size Requirements for Safety:  
Although the pre- specified statistical analysis methods are Bayesian, standard 
frequentist considerations are used to guide sample size selection . The sample size for 
primary safety computed for a Farrington -Manning test with PASS 13 indicates that, 
for 1:1 randomization, 90% power, alpha=0.05 (one- sided), CSE rate in both Groups of 
0.08 and non- inferiority margin of 0.08, the study requires a completed sample size of 
214 subjects in each Group , for a total of 428. Assuming a 5% rate of loss -to-follow-up 
(LTFU), [ADDRESS_722283] on sample size requirements.  If the CSE rate is 0.07 in the Pulsed Field group but 0.08 in the Thermal 
 
 group, 326 subjects are required to achieve 90% power (344 after compensating for 5% 
LTFU).  If the CSE rate is 0.10 in the Pulsed Field group but 0.08 in the Thermal group, 690 subjects are required to achieve 85% power (727 after compensating for 5% LTFU ). 
This uncertainty in the CSE rate motivates the use of a design wherein the sample size is adaptively determined, with possible sample sizes ranging from 350 to 750. 
Sample Size Requirements for Effectiveness:  
Although the pre- specified statistical methods are Bayesian, standard frequentist 
considerations are used to guide sample size selection . The sample size required for the 
primary effectiveness endpoint obtained by [CONTACT_276757] 13 for 1:1 randomization, 90% 
power, alpha=0.05 (one-sided), success rates in each group of 0.65 and non- inferiority 
margin δ=0.15 is 172 subjects in each arm , for a total of 344 subjects.  Similar to the 
safety objective, there is uncertainty in the success rates, especially in the Pulsed Fi eld 
group.  If the success rate in the Pulsed Field group is 0.625 but 0.65 in the Thermal 
group, 502 subjects are required to achieve 90% power (558 after compensating for up to 10% missing data).  If the success rate in the Pulsed Field group is 0.70 but 0.65 in the Thermal group, only 186 subjects are required to achieve 90% power (207 after compensating for missing data).   
This uncertainty in the Treatment Success rate motivates the use of a design wherein the sample size is adaptively determined, with possible sample sizes ranging from 200 to 550.   
Number of Enrolled Subjects : 
The primary population for the analysis of effectiveness is the MITT Population. The 
Safety Population should be similar but will not be smaller. Considering the joint 
sample size needs of the primary safety and effectiveness objectives, the primary analysis population may range from a minimum of 350 to a maximum of 750. 
To achieve a sample size of 750 MITT  Subjects , up to 900 subjects may  be enrolled 
consisting of 750 MITT and up to 105 Roll -In Subjects and up to 45 ITT Subjects (6%) 
who do not meet the criteria for the MITT Population . 
9.8 Analysis Plan 
This trial is designed using Bayesian statistical techniques.  The appropriate sample 
size is determined adaptively via a Goldilocks design
38, with possible sample sizes of 
N=350, 450, 550, 650, and 750.   
The sample size determination algorithm is as follows.  At a pre-defined interim 
analysis point (e .g., when N=N i subjects have been accrued  into the MITT population; 
Ni = 350, 450, 550 and 650), four predictive probabilities are calculated:  
PPi[INVESTIGATOR_11731],saf   =  Predictive probability that the trial will establish non -inferiority for safety,  
once the current sample (N i) is followed to 12 months. 
PPmax,saf   = Predictive probability that the trial will establish non -inferiority for safety,  
assuming the maximum sample size (750) is attained and followed to 12 
months.   
 
 PPi[INVESTIGATOR_11731],eff    = Predictive probability that the trial will establish non -inferiority for 
effectiveness,  once the current sample (N i) is followed to 12 months. 
PPmax,eff   = Predictive probability that the trial will establish non -inferiority for 
effectiveness,  assuming the maximum sample size (750) is attained and 
followed to [ADDRESS_722284] accrual will stop 
because final success is unlikely.  In either case, follow -up continues to 12 months for 
all subjects, at which time the final analysis will oc cur. If neither of these conditions 
obtains, enrollment will continue to the next larger sample size (subject to the 
maximum of 750) .  These analyses are termed " Interim Sample Size Looks."  Further 
detail s on the calculation of these predictive probabilities and specification of the 
thresholds {W eff,i, Feff,i, W saf,i, Fsaf,i}are provided in the SAP. 
Once subject accrual has stopped, all accrued subjects will be followed to 12 months, 
and then the inferential tests of non- inferiority will occur as described in Sections 9.5  
and 9.6. This is the only time that non -inferiority is tested.  
9.9 Assessment of the Secondary Safety Endpoint  
One endpoint – Aggregate PV Cross- Sectional Area (Section 7.2) – will be formally 
tested as a secondary safety endpoint.   
The paired comparison of change in the Aggregate PV Cross- Sectional Area between 
baseline and [ADDRESS_722285] changes in Aggregate PV 
Cross -sectional Area (3 -month minus baseline) will be compared between Pulsed Field 
and Thermal groups via a Bayesian version of a t- test. The null and alternative 
hypotheses are:  
H0: μT – μ C = 0  versus H A: μT – μ C > 0,  
where μ T represents the change (3 months minus baseline) in area in the treatment 
(Pulsed Field) group, and μ C represents the corresponding change in area in the control 
(Thermal) group. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the posterior probability P(H A | 
data) exceeds a threshold value Ψ PV = 0.975, corresponding to a one- sided significance 
level of 0.025.   
The population for analysis will be M ITT Subjects with pre - and post-procedure PV 
dimensional data related to one or more protocol-specified ablation lesions. 
Supplemental analyses will be performed using MITT single procedure subjects and the PP population. 
 
 9.10 Assessment of the Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The secondary effectiveness endpoint is Treatment Superiority, which  is Treatment 
Success ( Section 7.4) tested for s uperiority  between  the Pulsed Field and Thermal 
Groups.  
The principal analysis population for the secondary effectiveness endpoint is the MITT 
P
opulation. Analysis in the PP population will also be conducted as a sensitivity 
analysis.  
The null and alternative hypotheses are provided below. 
H0: PT ≤ P C versus H A: PT > P C 
where P T is the Treatment Success rate at [ADDRESS_722286] of non -inferiority, and superiority will be concluded if the posterior 
probability Pr(H A | data) > Ψ eff,sup, where the threshold Ψ eff,sup is a pre -specified 
threshold value that controls the one- sided type I error rate (under simulation) at level 
0.025. In the absence of missing data, the posterior distributions for P T and P C would be 
conjugate Beta distributions. However, some missing data are expected, and especially so at the interim analysis . Therefore, Bayesian multiple imputation of [ADDRESS_722287] Blinding  
Subjects will complete a survey regarding their opi[INVESTIGATOR_550303] / Rescheduled Index Procedure discharge and at the [ADDRESS_722288]: 
• Will be  introduced to the use and importance of EMs at the Baseline visit  
• Will be f ully instructed on the use of an  EM at the Day [ADDRESS_722289] with less than 80% of weeks covered by [CONTACT_550343]-up will be considered a protocol deviation. 
The EM will be returned to the ACL or the site at the time of the subject’s exit from the study. ECG data from the EM will be analyzed by [CONTACT_550344]. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_722290]: 
• Will be introduced to the use and importance of the Holter monitoring at the 
Baseline visit and the use of the EM hardware for this purpose. 
• Will be fully instructed on the use of a 72-hour continuous ECG (Holter)

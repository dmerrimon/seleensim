2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
2.1 Primary  Objective  
 
• To determine  the sensitivity  and specificity  of 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT  to detect  foci of 
primary  prostate  cancer  using  whole  mount  step sections  of the prostate  as a 
reference  standard.  
(68Ga-RM2  is a Galium -68 labeled,  gastrin  releasing  peptide  receptor  RM2 [DOTA -4-amino -1- 
carboxymethylpi[INVESTIGATOR_119510] -D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH 2]). 
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
 
• To compare the findings on 68 Ga-RM2 PET/CT in the prostate with 
multiparametric  MRI. 
• To study  biological  correlates  for the increased  GRPr  (gastrin  releasing  peptide  
receptor)  expression  of prostate  cancer.  Correlation  of PET/CT  findings  with:

2.3. Exploratory Analysis 
• To obtain  preliminary  data on the ability  of 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT  to detect  lymph  
node  metastases.  Because  of the limited  number  of high risk patients  included  
(n=6)  we expect  only few lymph  node  metastases.  The ability  of 68Ga-RM2 PET 
to detect  these  metastases  will be reported  in a descriptive  fashion.  
• To obtain further descriptive data on the safety of 68 Ga-RM2. 
 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1 The Problem Being Addressed: 
 
In 2013,  an estimated  238,540  US men will receive  a diagnosis  of prostate  cancer  and 29,170  are 
expected  to succumb  to the disease  (1). If we compare  this to 1988,  the incidence  today  is 2.4 times  
higher  but the mortality  estimate  is the same.  The Swedish  randomized  trial of radical  prostatectomy  
versus  watchful  waiting  demonstrated  a 50% reduction  in metastasis  and cancer  specific  mortality  
(2). In our experience  of about  1700  patients  treated  with surgery  alone,  15-year estimates  for PSA 
progression  and death  from disease  were  26% and 7% respectively.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_594683],  perioperative  morbidity  (e.g.,  acute  surgical  and anesthetic  complications,  need  for 
transfusions,  incision  pain, and time away  from normal  activities)  is still too common.  While  some  of 
these  events  have improved  with minimally  invasive  surgery,  other  key outcomes  measures  such  as 
positive  surgical  margins,  urinary  incontinence  and erectile  dysfunction  remain  unacceptably  high.  A 
patient  with clinically  localized  cancer  who is unlikely  to harbor  an indolent  tumor  and is 
contemplating  surgery  must  have a clear  understanding  of the treatment  goal: complete  removal  of 
the prostate,  seminal  vesicles  and nodes  (if indicated)  with a negative  margin  and complete  
preservation  of continence  and potency.  This is no easy task. The operation  is technically  
challenging  and its outcomes  are highly  sensitive  to fine nuances  in the surgical  technique.  
Knowledge  of cancer  location,  aggressiveness,  size and extent  are essential  if treatment  is to be 
tailored  to individual  patients.  
 
The need  for individualized  therapy  of prostate  cancer  has been  underlined  by a large  multicenter  
study  on the mortality  of prostate  cancer  (3). In this study  the 15-year prostate  cancer  specific  
mortality  rate was estimated  at 7%, with poorly  differentiated  cancer  and seminal  vesicle  invasion.  In 
contrast,  patients  with Gleason  score  [ADDRESS_784569]  risk of prostate  cancer  specific  
mortality  (0.03%).  This data clearly  demonstrates  the wide range  risk spectrum  of prostate  cancer  
and forms  a strong  impetus  for a risk-adjusted  management  for prostate  cancer.  
 
Advances  in imaging  have potential  for achieving  the goal of individualized  treatment.  As most  
cancers  treated  today  are not palpable,  the information  from imaging  will help the surgeon  improve  
preoperative  staging  and deliver  a more  efficient  surgical  strategy.  Imaging  is also necessary  for 
focal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594684],  such  as radiotherapy  or focused  ultrasound  (4). 
 
Management  of patients  with these  low-risk tumors  could  be significantly  improved  by [CONTACT_594704]-invasive  
imaging  studies.  Current  active  surveillance  strategies  require  repeated  biopsies  in addition  to digital  
rectal  examination  and PSA testing  (5, 6). 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -146 A(5)  
Approval date: 05 -Sep-2018   
 
 
Thus  there  are four unmet  medical  needs  that could  be addressed  by [CONTACT_594705]:  (i) better  identification  of clinically  significant  prostate  cancers,  (ii) better  delineation  for 
prostate  cancer  for focal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  (iii) accurate  non-invasive  detection  of lymph  node  metastases  
and (iv) non-invasive  ways  to monitor  patients  during  active  surveillance.  The goal of this trial is to 
obtain  initial  clinical  data whether  PET/CT  with a new ligand,  targeting  the gastrin  releasing  peptide  
receptor  (GRPr)  can address  these  needs.  
3.2. Existing  Imaging  Modalities  in Prostate  Cancer  
 
The cross -sectional  imaging  modalities  that are used  to evaluate  prostate  cancer  include  transrectal  
ultrasound  (TRUS),  x-ray computed  tomography  (CT),  magnetic  resonance  imaging  ( MRI),  magnetic  
resonance  spectroscopy  (MRS)  as well as positron  emission  tomography  with fluorodeoxyglucose  
(FDG)  or choline.  
3.2.1  Computed  tomography  (CT) 
 
CT generally  cannot  detect  disease  that is confined  to the prostate  because  of the limited  
contrast  between  tumor  and normal  prostate.  In patients  with high risk disease  CT is used  to 
exclude  macroscopic  lymphadenopathy.  However,  the sensitivity  of CT to detect  lymph  node  
metastases  is limited,  because  metastases  frequently  do not cause  a significant  enlargement  of 
the node  at the time of diagnosis.  A meta -analysis  of [ADDRESS_784570] for detection  of lymph  node  metastases  was 42% at a specificity  of 82% (7). 
3.2.2  Transrectal  Ultrasound  (TRUS)  
 
Transrectal  ultrasound  was introduced  in the 1970s  and is used  to localize  areas  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_594685]  (8). TRUS  visualizes  the seminal  vesicles  and 
the ampulla  of the vas deferens.  TRUS  imaging  also allows  to differentiate  the peripheral  
hyperechogenic  zone  from the central  hypoechogenic  zone.  These  anatomical  features  are used  
to guide  systematic  transrectal  biopsies.  Prostate  cancer  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_594686].  However,  up to 50% of prostate  cancer  show  a similar  echogenicity   
than the peripheral  zone  which  limits  the sensitivity  of the technique  for prostate  cancer   
detection.  Biopsies  of prostate  cancer  guided  by [CONTACT_594706] a poor correlation  with 
the highest  Gleason  score  as determined  from systematic  biopsies  or prostatectomy  specimens.  
In a multicenter  study  including  almost  4000  patients,  prostate  cancer  was detected  in 25% of  
the hypoechogenic  and in 25% of the isoechogenic  lesions  (8). 
3.2.3  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  and spectroscopy  (MRI/MRS)  
 
Magnetic  resonance  imaging  has been  extensively  studied  for the detection  and staging  of 
prostate  cancer  as well as for differentiating  clinically  significant  prostate  cancers  from 
insignificant  cancers  (9). Commonly  used  MRI techniques  include  T2 weighted  and diffusion  
weighted  images  as well as contrast  enhanced,  T1 weighted  images.  The sensitivity  and 
specificity  for detection  of prostate  cancer  varies  with the used  techniques  and higher  diagnostic  
accuracy  is obtained  by [CONTACT_594707]  (multiparametric  MRI).  MRI 
provides  excellent  soft-tissue  resolution  and is the most  sensitive  anatomic  imaging  modality  
available  for the detection  and staging  of localized  prostate  cancer.  A standard  prostate  
examination  includes  at least multi-planar  T1 - and T2 -weighted  imaging  and diffusion -weighted  
MRI (DW-MRI).  These  sequences  are frequently  complemented  by T1 weighted  contrast

enhan ced study (dynamic contrast enhan ced MRI, DCE-MRI). On T2 weighted images, prostate 
cancer  usually  demonstrates  decreased  signal  intensity  within  the high-signal -intensity  peripheral  
zone.  However,  the detection  of prostate  cancer  can be hampered  by [CONTACT_594708],  such  as post-biopsy  hemorrhage  and chronic  prostatitis  (9). 
 
DW-MRI allows  for the measurement  of water  diffusivity.  The degree  of water  diffusivitiy  can be 
quantified  by [CONTACT_594709]ﬁ cient  (ADC),  a measure  of average  molecular  motion  in 
the intra- and extracellular  space  (10). Generally,  prostate  cancer  is detected  as an area of low 
ADC.  DCE-MRI involves  the assessment  of changes  in signal  intensity  over time after contrast  
injection.  During  DCE-MRI, the contrast  agent  gadopentetate  dimeglumine  (Gd-DTPA)  is  
injected  intravenously  and passes  from the intravascular  space  to the interstitial  space  at a rate 
that depends  on perfusion,  vascularity,  extracellular  volume  and vascular  permeability.  Prostate  
cancer  typi[INVESTIGATOR_594687].  The 
signal  from  DCE  MRI can quantified  by [CONTACT_594710]   a parameter  
describing  the transfer  of contrast  from the vascular  space  to the extracellular  space  and kep 
which  describes  the transport  from the extracellular  space  to the vascular  space  (9). 
 
Magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy  (MRS)  provides  maps  of the distribution  of choline,  creatine,  
citrate  and polyamines.  Prostate  cancer  typi[INVESTIGATOR_594688]  (9). 
 
While  multiparametric,  multiplanar  MRI is currently  the most  accurate  technique  to detect  
prostate  cancer,  sensitive  and specific  detection  of prostate  cancer  remains  challenging,  
especially  for tumors  with low Gleason  scores.  Furthermore,  MRI signals  do not accurately  
reflect  Gleason  scores.  
 
Detection  of lymph  node  metastases  on MRI is based  on the size of the lymph  node  and 
therefore  faces  similar  limitations  than CT. A meta -analysis  reported  a pooled  sensitivity  and 
specificity  of 39% and 82% (7). MRI is highly  accurate  for the diagnosis  of bone  metastases  of 
prostate  cancer  and is frequently  used  to corroborate  bone  scintigraphy  findings  (particularly  
when  the earliest  involvement  is thought  to be present  in the bone  marrow).  MRI is most  
sensitive  in the axial skeleton  and pelvis,  and is less effective  in the ribs, chest  wall, and skull.  
3.2.[ADDRESS_784571] to trauma,  infection  and non-physiologic  stress.  Consequently  the 
specificity  of radionuclide  bone  scanning  is low. In addition,  the common  occurrence  of the flare 
phenomenon  (a paradoxical  increase  in intensity  after successful  therapy  due to healing  of the 
bone  matrix)  complicates  the interpretation  of scans  on a serial  basis.  
3.2.5  Positron  Emission  Tomography (PET)  
 
PET has advantages  over other  imaging  methods  because  it quantitatively  assesses  biologic  
processes  in vivo and can assess  different  processes  using  specific  radiotracers.  Processes  that 
can be analyzed  with currently  available  reagents  include  glucose  and amino  acid metabolism  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Approval date: 05 -Sep-2018   
 
 
and proliferation,  blood  flow, and receptor  status  (i.e., androgen  receptor).  However,  most  
studies  have focused  on the accumulation  radiolabeled  choline  or choline  analogs  and FDG.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  FDG  PET 
 
During  the past decade,  investigators  at MSKCC  have shown  that PET imaging  in prostate  
cancer  can be tested  prospectively  using  rigorous,  carefully  controlled  standard  clinical  trial 
designs  traditionally  reserved  for therapeutics.  FDG PET has been  shown  to be clinically  
valuable  to differentiate  between  active  and inactive/treated  metastases  in castration  
resistant  prostate  cancer  (11, 12). FDG  PET was also found  useful  for monitoring  
chemotherapy  in patients  with metastatic  prostate  cancer.  However,  FDG  uptake  of primary  
prostate  cancer  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_594689], and the sensitivity  of FDG  PET for detection  of primary  
prostate  cancer  is therefore  limited.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Choline  PET 
 
11C-Choline  has recently  been  FDA approved  for detection  of recurrent  prostate  cancer.  11C- 
Choline  as well 18F labeled  choline  analogs  (fluoroethylcholine  and fluoromethylcholine)  are 
commonly  used  in Europe  for restaging  of prostate  cancer  in patients  with rising  prostate  
specific  antigen  (PSA)  levels  following  radical  prostatectomy  or radiotherapy  for prostate  
cancer(13,  14). Choline  PET has also been  studied  for detection  of primary  prostate  cancer  
and of lymph  node  metastases  at the time of initial  diagnosis.  While  initial  studies  reported  a 
high sensitivity  and specificity  for detection  of prostate  cancer,  more  recent  studies  have 
indicated  that choline  is also significantly  accumulated  by [CONTACT_594711]  (15). Systematic  studies  correlating  choline  uptake  in the prostate  with 
step-section  whole  mount  histology  found  only a low sensitivity  and specificity  for detection  of 
prostate  cancer.  Focal  choline  uptake  in regional  lymph  nodes  is quite specific  for metastatic  
disease  (specificity  94%),  but the sensitivity  was only 56% in a recent  study  including  more  
than 200 patients  with newly  diagnosed  prostate  cancer  (16). 
 
In summary,  a variety  of clinically  available  imaging  modalities  have been  studied  for imaging  of 
prostate  cancer.  Currently  MRI is the most  accurate  imaging  technology  for detection  and 
regional  staging  of prostate  cancer.  However,  even MRI demonstrated  significant  limitations  in 
the detection  and delineation  of prostate  cancer  as well as in the accurate  detection  of regional  
lymph  node  metastases.  Consequently,  there  is a clear  clinical  need  for novel  approaches  for 
prostate  cancer  imaging.  
3.3 Gastrin  Releasing  Peptide  Receptor  (GRPr)  in Prostate  Cancer  
 
An attractive  target  for a more  sensitive  and specific  imaging  of prostate  cancer  is the gastrin  
releasing  peptide  receptor  (GRPr),  a G protein  coupled  receptor  that is a member  of the bombesin  
receptor  family.  The bombesin  family  receptor  is named  after 14 amino  acid peptide  bombesin  which  
was initially  detected  in the skin of the toad bombina.  The bombesin  receptor  family  comprises  of 
four receptors,  the BB1 or neuromedin  receptor,  the BB2 or GRPr  receptor,  the BB3 receptor  which  
is not found  in humans  and the BB4 receptor  for which  the natural  ligand  is currently  unknown  (17). 
 
GRPr  and its human  ligand,  gastrin  releasing  peptide  (GRP),  are physiologically  expressed  in the 
central  nervous  system  and the gastrointestinal  tract (17). GRPr  overexpression  has been  observed  
in a variety  of malignant  tumors  including  breast  cancer,  small  cell lung cancer  and (17), but most

consistently  in prostate  cancer.  An autoradiographic  study  found  markedly  increased  binding  of 
radiolabeled  bombesin  by [CONTACT_594712][INVESTIGATOR_315801]  (PIN)  and all [ADDRESS_784572],  normal  and hyperplastic  prostate  tissue  demonstrate  no or very low 
binding  of bombesin  (18). 
 
The potential  of radiolabeled  peptides  in nuclear  medicine  to target  tumor  receptors  has been  
investigated  for many  years  and has been  proven  to be successful  especially  in the case  of 
somatostatin.  The radiotracer  [68 Ga]DOTA -D-Phe1 -Tyr3-Octreotid  (DOTATOC)  is used  for the 
diagnosis  of neuroendocrine  tumors  in clinical  routine  (19). Peptides  provide  excellent  
characteristics  for PET-imaging  because  they can easily  be synthesized,  have fast and specific  
targeting  features  and are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_594690].  In particular,  
peptides  targeting  G-protein  coupled  receptors  are effective  in accumulating  in tumors  in vivo. 
Peptides  can also easily  be labeled  with therapeutic  radionuclides  for radiopeptide  therapy  of 
metastatic  tumors.  This ―theranostic ‖ concept  has been  highly  successful  for imaging  and treatment  
of neuoroendocrine  tumors  with the combination  of 68Ga-DOTATOC  PET imaging  90 Y-DOTA -TOC 
therapy  (19). 
 
The physiologic  ligand  of GRPr  in humans  is gastrin  releasing  peptide  (GRP),  a [ADDRESS_784573] been  tested  in 
preclinical  models  of prostate  cancer  as well as in preliminary  clinical  trials  (20). However,  most  of 
these  ligands  demonstrated  high gastrointestinal  uptake  and insufficient  metabolic  stability  in-vivo. 
Furthermore,  GRPr  agonists  can cause  acute  side effects  (abdominal  cramps,  vomiting)  when  
administered  at higher  doses,  as needed  for radionuclide  therapy  (21). These  limitations  can 
potentially  be overcome  by [CONTACT_594713] . Non-radioactive  labeled  GRPr  
antagonists  have been  developed  as anti-cancer  agents,  since  GRP  is involved  in mitogenic  auto- 
and paracrine  signaling  loops  (17). These  compounds  were  found  to cause  only minimal  side effects  
in clinical  trials (22). 
 
Our group  has developed  several  radiolabeled  GRPr  antagonists  for imaging  and radionuclide  
therapy  of prostate  cancer.  In mice  these  tracers  showed  higher  tumor  uptake  than GRPr  agonists.   
In addition,  the antagonists  showed  rapid  clearance  from tissues  with physiologic  expression  
(gastrointestinal  tract and pancreas)  while  they were  retained  for more  than 24 h in GRPr  expressing  
prostate  tumor  xenografts  (23, 24). 
Of the studied  GRPr  antagonists,  64Cu-AR-CBC-TE2A  demonstrated  the most  favorable  
characteristics  with respect  to tumor  uptake  and tumor -to-organ -ratios  (23). Because  of the 64Cu 
label (T1/2=12.7  h) pharmacokinetics  of 64Cu-CBC-TE2A  can be studied  over several  hours.  Based  
on these  encouraging  characteristics  we selected  this compound  for initial  clinical  studies.  
 
In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 64Cu-AR-CBC-TE2A  biodistribution  and tumor  uptake  were  in 4 patients  with newly  
diagnosed  prostate  cancer  at the University  of Freiburg.  Patient  characteristics  are summarized  in 
table 1.

Table  1. Characteristics  of patients  studied  with 64Cu-AR-CBC-TE2A  
 
All 4 tumors  were  visualized  on the PET/CT  images.  Importantly,  good  contrast  between  the 
tumor  and normal  prostate  tissue  was achieved  with [ADDRESS_784574] injection.  These  
data therefore  indicate  that a long lived radionuclide  is not necessary  for PET/CT  imaging  of 
GRPr  expressing  tumors.  
For radiolabeling  of peptides  the positron  emitter  Gallium -68 (68 Ga) is particularly  attractive.  
68Ga can be produced  in radionuclide  generator  from the long lived parent  radionuclide  
Germanium -68. This a significant  advantage  when  compared  to 64Cu which  is produced  in a 
cyclotron  with an expensive  solid target  that is difficult  to handle.  64Cu is therefore  only 
produced  at a few centers  within  the US. The physical  half-live of 68 Ga is only 68 minutes  
which  results  in a low radiation  exposure  of the patients  as compared  to 64Cu  (physical  half- 
life 12 h). 68Ga labeling  of peptides  is performed  with the commonly  used  Chelator  DOTA  
(diethylentetraaminopentaacetat).  68Ga labeled  peptides  are in broad  clinical  use for imaging  
of neuroendocrine  tumors  in Europe.  
Because  of these  favorable  characteristics  we are evaluating  a 68 Ga labeled  GRPr  binding  peptide  
68Ga-RM2 for imaging  of prostate  cancer.  
3.4 Properties of 68Ga-RM2 (BAY 86-7548)  
3.4.1  Receptor  affinity  in-vitro  
 
In vitro, RM2 demonstrated  high and selective  binding  affinity  to the GRPr  (IC 50  7.7-9.3nM,  
K d  2.5-3.1nM)  whereas  no binding  was detected  to other  bombesin  receptor  subtypes  such  
as neuromedin  B (25). RM2 showed  antagonistic  properties  due to inhibition  of GRPr  
receptor  internalization  in GRPr -transfected  HEK-cells and Ca2+ mobilization  in PC-3 cells.  
No species  differences  in GRPr  binding  affinity  between  mouse,  rat and human  receptors  
was found  (25).

3.4.2  Tumor  uptake  and biodistribution  in mice  
 
High and specific  tumor  uptake  of RM2 was found  in mice  bearing  GRPr  expressing  human  
prostate  cancer  models:  the androgen -independent  PC-3 xenograft  (14%  ID/g at 1h p.i.) and 
the androgen -dependent  LNCaP  xenograft  (6% ID/g at 1h p.i.). Low uptake  in non-target  
organs  resulted  in high tumor -to-tissue  (T/T)  ratios  at 1h p.i. favorable  for PET imaging  (e.g. 
T/Blood  = 25, T/Muscle = 130 for PC3 tumors).  RM2 was mainly  excreted  via the urinary  
pathway  (~70%  ID after 1h, >80%  after 2h). (25) 
3.4.3  Pharmacokinetics  and Metabolism  in mice  
 
In vitro, it was shown  that the compound  has a high stability  in serum  and liver microsomes.  
Negligible  degradation  of [177 Lu]-labeled  RM2 was detected  in vitro when  incubated  in   
human  serum  over a time period  of 96 h as analyzed  by [CONTACT_186355] -HPLC.  After 96h incubation  
70% of the peptide  was still intact.  Microsomal  stability  of radioactive  RM2 tested  in human  
and mouse  liver microsomes  showed  minor  but cofactor -independent  degradation  of the 
tracer  after 60 min incubation  as analyzed  by [CONTACT_186355] -HPLC  (BAY  86-7548  investigators  
brochure).  Metabolic  profiling  of BAY 86-7548  showed  that 2 metabolites  in minor  amounts  
are generated  in the presence  of liver microsomes  and hepatocytes  of both rat and human.  
After intravenous  administration  of the non-radioactive  precursor  of 68Ga-RM2 in rat the 
compound  distributes  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_594691]-life of t 1/2 of 0.07 h and is 
also rapi[INVESTIGATOR_594692] a beta half-life of 0.19 h.  After intravenous  administration  of  
[68Ga] labeled  RM2 to mice  it was shown  that the radioactivity  is mainly  excreted  renally  via 
urine.  In vivo evaluation  of metabolism  of the radioactive  RM2 was performed  in mouse  using  
radio  HPLC.  In this study  minor  amounts  of polar  metabolites  were  found  in plasma.  In urine,  
one of these  polar  metabolites  was also identified  as dominant  degradation  product  which  
increased  over time,  while  intact  peptide  was still detected  in the urine  after 10-[ADDRESS_784575]  to studies  addressing  
effects  on the central  nervous  system  (integrated  into extended  single  dose  toxicity  study),  
cardiovascular  system  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_36517].  Since  the studies  were  intended  to address  
the effects of the chemical entity only, a mixture (500:1) of RM2 and stable Ga-RM2) which 
are the precursor  and the non-radioactive  analogue  of 68 Ga-RM2 was dissolved  in 0.9%  NaCl  
and given  to rats as a single  intravenous  injection.  Doses  were  0 (vehicle),  0.11,  1.05 and 
10.5 mg/kg.  The overall  results  of the in vivo safety  pharmacology  showed  no adverse  
effects  on central  nervous  system  function  and pulmonary  function  in rats. A transient  slight  
increase  in systolic  and diastolic  blood  pressure  was found  immediately  after administration  
of the high dose.  The no observed   effect  level (NOEL)  was 1.05 mg/kg  suggesting  a safety  
factor  of 300 to the planned  maximal  human  mass  dose  of 30 µg of the mixture  of RM2 and 
68Ga-RM2 per patient (conversion based on body surface area). 
3.4.5  Safety,  pharmacokinetics  metabolism  in humans  
 
The safety,  pharmacokinetics  and metabolism  of 68Ga-RM2 were  studied  in 5 male  
volunteers  (26). The 68Ga radioactivity  was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_594693]. Maximum  peak

uptake  of the total injected  radioactivity  was seen  in the urinary  bladder  contents  and the 
liver, with approximately  36% and 14%,  respectively.  The proportion  of intact  RM2 on total 
radioactivity  in venous  plasma  declined  over time,  and 3 metabolites  were  detected by [CONTACT_186355] - 
HPLC.  The proportions  of unchanged  68Ga-RM2 were  92%±9%,  68%±9%,  47%±6%,  
29%±6%,  19%±2%,  16%±4%,  and 15%±2%  at 1, 10, 20, 40, 65, 100, and 150 min after 
injection,  respectively.  The in vitro investigations  applying  human  hepatocytes  revealed  the 
metabolic  pathways.  Metabolite  M-1 (68 Ga-DOTA  chelate)  appeared  to be major,  and M-2 
(cleavage  of amide  bond  at alanine –valine)  and M-3 (hydrolysis  of glutamine  residue)  were  
minor  constituents  of total radioactivity.  
 
The unchanged  tracer  reached  maximum  plasma  concentration  after about  10 min and was 
eliminated  from the circulation,  with a terminal  half-life of about  80 min. The total clearance  
was estimated  to be about  55 L/h. No significant  changes  in vital signs,  EKG  and routine  
laboratory  parameters  were  observed  (26). 
3.4.6  Uptake  in human  prostate  cancer  
 
A recent  study  of 68Ga-RM2 in 11 patients  with newly  diagnostic  prostate  cancer  reported  a 
sensitivity  of 88% and a specificity  of 81% for detection  of prostate  cancer  foci in 132 
prostate  regions  (27). This study  did not include  detailed  comparisons  with multiparametric  
MRI and no detailed  correlative  studies,  such  as correlation  with ETS transcription  factor  
rearrangements,  was performed.  68Ga-RM2 also identified  tumor  recurrence  in two of three  
patients  with biochemical  recurrence  (27). 
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
Patients  with newly  diagnosed  prostate  cancer  scheduled  to undergo  radical  prostatectomy  
are eligible  to register  for this study,  providing  all other  eligibility  criteria  are met. Patients  can 
be co-registered  to therapeutic  clinical  trials,  but may not receive  any treatment  between  the 
PET study  and the prostatectomy.  6 patients  with low-risk, 8 patients  with intermediate -risk 
and 6 patients  with high-risk tumors  according  to NCCN  guidelines  (2.2014)  will be included.  
Patients  in ―very low‖, ―locally  advanced ‖, ―very high‖, and ―metastatic ‖ risk categories  of the 
NCCN  guidelines  will not be included  in this study.  We expect  the information  of RM-2 
PET/CT  to be most  clinically  relevant  in the ―low‖, ―intermediate ‖, and ―high risk‖ patients.  
The classification  of patients  as low, intermediate  and high risk is based  on Gleason  score,  
clinical  T stage  and serum  PSA level.  All of these  parameters  are routinely  known  before  the 
planned  surgical  procedure  and documented  in the patient‘s  medical  record.  We will create a 
spreadsheet  with the number  of patients  in each  risk group.  As soon  as the planned  number  
of patients  in a specific  risk group  has been  accrued  we will no longer  screen  for patients  in 
this risk group.  
The goal of this proposal  is to systematically  evaluate  a [ADDRESS_784576].

IRB Number: 14 -146 A(5)

The primary  objective  (specific  aim 1) is to determine  the sensitivity  and specificity  of 
PET/CT  with the GRPr  antagonist  68Ga-RM2 to detect  foci of primary  prostate  cancer.  
Approach : we will include  20 patients  with newly  diagnosed  prostate  cancer  (Gleason  score  
6 to 8) scheduled  to undergo  radical  prostatectomy.  Localization  will be defined  using  a total 
of 12 regions  within  the prostate.  To facilitate  correlation  of radiotracer  uptake  with histology  
and MRI findings,  PET/CT  images  will be coregistered  with a T2 weighted  MR images  of the 
prostate  (see specific  aim 2). Radiotracer  uptake  within  each  region  (expressed  as 
standardized  uptake  value,  SUV)  will be assessed  without  knowledge  of other  imaging  or 
clinical  patient  characteristics.  
Secondary  objective  1 (specific  aim 2) is to compare  GRPr  PET/CT  for localizing  prostate  
cancer  with MRI and to determine  if the combination  of 68 Ga-PET and MRI is more  accurate  
for detection  of prostate  cancer  than either  68 Ga-PET and MRI alone.  Approach:  MR imaging  
(established  as standard  of care at our institution)  will include  T2-weighted  as well as  
diffusion  weighted  imaging.  MR images  will be read (i) blinded  to the results  of GRPr  PET/CT  
and (ii) using  fusion  images  of MR and PET.  The level of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_594694] a 5 point  scale.  We will compare  the ROC  curves,  
sensitivity  and specificity  of GRPr  PET/CT,  MRI and GRPr  PET/MR  using  a McNemar‘s  test 
adjusted  for multiple  regions.  
Secondary  objective  2 (specific  aim 3) is to perform  exploratory  analyses  of histological,  
immunohistochemical,  genetic  and gene  expression  features  of the resected  tumors  in order  
to identify  factors  influencing  68Ga-RM2 uptake.  Appr oach:  we will correlate  68 Ga-RM2 uptake  
with Gleason  score,  GRPr  expression  (as determined  by [CONTACT_9064]),  as well as 
the presence  of ERG  and ETV1  rearrangements.  These  rearrangements  have recently  been  
shown  to be associated  with increased  GRPr  RNA expression  in patients  with prostate  
cancer,  but their relationship  to GRPr  protein  expression  and GRPr  ligand  binding  is currently  
unknown.  In order  to undertand  the relationship  between  AR signaling  and uptake  of 68Ga- 
RM2 we also determine  the correlation  between  AR staining  on immunohistochemistry  and 
an AR gene  expression  signature.  
In an exploratory  analysis  we will record  the frequency  of lymph  node  metastases  on 
histopathology  and the diagnostic  accuracy  of 68Ga-RM2-PET/CT  to detect  these  
metastases.  Analysis  will be performed  on the basis  of lymph  node  regions  that can be 
identified  on the PET/CT  images  to ensure  that findings  on PET are correctly  matched  with 
positive  nodes  on histopathology.  Lymph  node  regions  will include:  internal  iliac, obturator,  
presacral,  external  iliac, common  iliac (each  on the left and right side).  For each  of these  
anatomical  lymph  node  regions  an assessment  will be made  on the PET/CT  images  if there  
is focal 68Ga-RM2 uptake  (above  regional  background)  on PET in a lymph  node  identified  on 
CT. 
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
The intervention  is the administration  of a single  dose  of 150-200 MBq 68Ga-RM2 (mass  <= 
30 µg) for imaging  purposes.  This will be followed  by a 30-40 min PET/CT  study  after a 
waiting  period  of 60 min (+/- 10 min).  Prior clinical  experience  suggests  that imaging  can be 
performed  within  [ADDRESS_784577] injection  (27, 28). MR imaging  and prostatectomy  will be 
performed  as standard  of care at MSKCC.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -146 A(5)  
Approval date: 05 -Sep-2018   
 
 
If less than 150 MBq of 68Ga-RM2 are synthesized  due to technical  difficulties,  patient  can be 
injected  with that amount.  However,  only a limited  PET/CT  will be performed  over the region  
of interest,  over the pelvis  with acquisition  time per bed position  adjusted  to the lower  amount  
of injected  radioactivity.  
 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS

Approval date: [ADDRESS_784583].  The documentation  will include  administration  date/  time,  calibration  
date/time,  quantity,  patient  code,  lot number  and date of destruction.  The investigator  should  
maintain  records  that document  adequately  that the patients  were  provided  the dose  specified  in the 
protocol  and reconcile  the medication  received  for the study.  The label of each  vial will contain  the 
patient  code  and lot number,  patient  and radiopharmaceutical  information  will be entered  in the 
radiopharmacy  drug accountability  forms.  The investigator  may assign  some  or all of the 
investigator‘s  duties  for drug accountability  to an appropriate  individual  such  as pharmacist  or 
nuclear  medicine  technician  who is under  the supervision  of the investigator.  
9.2 PET/CT  imaging  
 
PET/CT  imaging  will be performed  within  two weeks  prior to the planned  prostatectomy.  
 
No specific  patient  preparation  is required  before  68Ga-RM2 injection.  One intravenous  
catheter  (Hep-Lock)  will be placed  by [CONTACT_594714].  
68Ga-RM2  preparation  
Radiolabeling  of 68Ga-RM2.  Labeling  will be performed  in accordance  with the IND. The 
study  will be performed  under  an FDA approved  IND for 68Ga-RM2; no studies  will be 
performed  until the IND is approved.  The final product  will contain  150-[ADDRESS_784584]  is to be used  
within  60 minutes  after manufacturing.  
 
Package  Labeling  and Formulation  
 
Each  vial will contain  the following  information  on the label:  
 
 
 
Images  will be corrected  for attenuation  and scatter  and adjusted  for system  sensitivity  and 
providing  parametric  images  in terms  of standardized  uptake  values  (SUV)  (= MBq found/gm  
tissue  / (MBq  injected/gm  body mass).  
PET scanning: In order  to provide  reproducible  clinical  data,  we will acquire  all [ADDRESS_784585] scanner  at MSKCC  (same  or a newer  generation  scanner).  
Intravenou s injection of 68 Ga-RM2 (maximum of 200 MBq) will be given as a bolus. A PET- 

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -146 A(5)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_784586] scan extending  from top of skull to mid thighs  will be performed  to determine  the 
biodistribution  60 min (+/- 10 min) after injection.  The low dose  CT portion  of the study  will 
utilize  80 mA. 
If less than 150 MBq of 68Ga-RM2 is acquired  and injected,  only a limited  PET/CT  will be 
performed  over the pelvis  and acquisition  times  per bed position  will be increased.  
 
Because  the diagnostic  accuracy  of RM2-PET/CT  for detection  of prostate  cancer  and 
prostate  cancer  metastases  is currently  not known,  the result  of the RM2 -PET/CT  will in 
general  have  no impact  on patient  management.  However,  in the special  case  of focal RM2 
uptake in the bone marrow (outside the field of view of the prostate MRI), a dedicated MRI of 
the involved  region  will be discussed  with the referring  clinician  and the patient.  Because  
bone  marrow  is a frequent  site for prostate  cancer  metastases  and studies  in normal  
volunteers  have  not shown  any relevant  RM2 uptake  in the bone  marrow,  focal RM2 uptake  
in the bone  marrow  has to be considered  as suspi[INVESTIGATOR_594696].  MRI 
is highly  sensitive  and specific  for bone  marrow  metastases  and is not associated  with an 
additional  risk for the patient.  If bone  marrow  metastases  are seen  on MRI, patients  are 
generally  no longer  treated  with radical  prostatectomy.  Because  radical  pros tatectomy  is 
associated  with significant  morbidity,  we would  therefore  consider  it as ethically  problematic  
not to further  evaluate  focal RM2 uptake  in the bone  marrow  by [CONTACT_9268]. 
9.3 PET/MR  coregistration  
 
Mirada  (www.mirada -medical.com)  provides  dedicated  software  to permit  manual  rigid and 
deformable  registrations  to align images  acquired  in separate  sessions.  We have used  this 
software  to register  PET and MR datasets  through  anatomical  co-registration  of the low-dose  
CT scan of the PET/CT  and MR data.  The resultant  transformation  was then applied  to the 
PET data.  This co-registration  capability  will allow  us to meet  our primary  objective  of 
determining  the distribution  of radiolabeled  bombesin  in the prostate  within  a ―sextant ‖ model  
used  previously  by [CONTACT_27156]  (29).  In this model  the prostate  is divided  in left/right  base,  
left/right  midgland  and left/right  apex.  Each  of these  sextants  is further  divided  into peripheral  
and transition  zones.  We acknowledge  the imperfect  nature  of the ―sextant ‖ approach  for 
localization,  particularly  on PET/CT  where  the normal  anatomy  is less well-delineated,  but 
co-registration  with MRI based  on anatomical  landmarks  such  as the urethra,  verumontanum  
and ejaculatory  ducts  should  minimize  localization  errors  and improve  imaging  to pathology  
correlation.  
9.4 Immunohistochemistry  and gene  expression  analysis  
 
The expression  of GRPr  by [CONTACT_594715]  (30, 31). Preliminary  data in prostate  tumor  xenografts  
treated  with androgen  deprivation  therapy  suggest  that GRPr  expression  is AR regulated  (32, 
33). Conversely,  GRPr  expression  can induce  androgen  independent  growth  of prostate  
cancer  cells (34). We will therefore  stain the tumors  for nuclear  AR as well as for PSA 
(positively  regulated  by [CONTACT_107285]) and PSMA  (negatively  regulated  by [CONTACT_107285], (35)) in order  to 
interrogate  the relationship  between  GRPr  expression,  in vivo 68Ga-RM2 binding,  and AR 
signaling.  Semiquantitative  assays  for AR and PSA are established  at the prostate  SPORE  
core lab. The relationship  of GRPr  and PSMA  expression  is also interesting  from an imaging  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -146 A(5)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_784587] shown  encouraging  results  in 
metastatic  prostate  cancer  (36-38). Staining  for PSMA  and GRPr  will allow  us to evaluate  
whether  PSMA  and GRPr  based  PET imaging  provide  complementary  information  about  
tumor  biology.  This is suggested  by [CONTACT_594716]  (18, 39). A 
recent  study  indicated  that GRPr  is a shared  target  gene  of two ETS transcription  factors  that 
are involved  in the development  and progression  of prostate  cancer  (ERG  and ETV1)  (40). 
ETS rearrangements  are considered  an early event  in prostate  carcinogenesis,  which  may 
explain  the overexpression  of GRPr  in PIN and low-grade  prostate  cancers.  Nuclear  
expression  of ERG  is a sensitive  and specific  marker  for the presence  of the TMPRSS2-ERG 
rearrangement  and ERG mRNA  expression  (41). We will therefore  stain the tumors  for 
nuclear  ERG  using  established  protocols  at MSKCC  (41) and correlate  the staining  with  
GRPr  immunohistochemistry  as well as in vivo 68Ga-RM2 binding.  Loss of PTEN  is closely  
linked  to aberrant  gene  expression  by [CONTACT_594717]  (42). Staining  
for PTEN  will therefore  also be included  in our analysis.  
FISH  analysis : In order  to further  investigate  the relationship  between  ETS and AR signaling,  
we will use FISH  for the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion  gene  (43) to assess  the type of 
rearrangement  (i.e., whether  it is by [CONTACT_594718]).  We will also use FISH  to 
assess  the tumors  for ETV1  rearrangements  and AR amplification  using  established  
protocols  at the prostate  SPORE  core lab. 
 
Gene  expression  analysis : We will determine  GRPr  mRNA  levels  of the tumors,  normal  
prostate  and benign  prostate  tumors  and correlate  those  with GRPr  immunohistochemistry  
and in vivo uptake  of 68Ga-RM2.  We will also determine  the RNA  expression  levels  for AR 
regulated  genes  including  PSA,  HK2 TMPRSS2, FKBP5,  STEAP  and PSMA  as a readout  for 
AR output.  This ―AR signature ‖ will be correlated  with uptake of 68Ga-RM2.  
 
 
10.0 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
Laboratory  Safety  Assessments  
 
Hematology  and blood  chemistry  assessments  (CBC,  PSA,  serum  BUN,  creatinine,  AST,  ALT, total 
bilirubin,  alkaline  phosphatase,  albumin,  blood  glucose  levels,  and serum  testosterone  level)  will be 
done  at the time points  described  in Table  2. Additional  blood  tests  may also be performed  at the 
discretion  of the investigator  for the purposes  of investigation  and follow -up of adverse  events.  
 
Physical  examination  
 
A physical  examination  including,  but not limited  to, general  appearance,  skin, neck,  eyes,  ears,  
throat,   lungs,  heart,  abdomen,  lymph  nodes,  extremities,  and nervous  system  will be performed.  
The physical  examination  will include  examination  of known  and suspected  sites of disease.  
Physical  examination  results,  height  and weight  will be recorded  at baseline  .

Image  data analysis  
 
PET and MRI exams  will be evaluated  by a nuclear  medicine  physician  (W. Weber)  and an 
experienced  radiologist  (H.A.  Vargas),  respectively,  blinded  to the findings  of the other  imaging  test, 
the biopsy  results  or any other  clinical  data except  for the fact that the patient  has prostate  cancer.  
PET/CT.  The reader  will record  the level of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_594697]  a 5-point  index  scale.  The minimum  intensity  of uptake  for a 
positive  lesion  (score  > 1 on the 5 point  scale)  will be defined  as mean  uptake  in normal  prostate  
tissue  plus two-times  the standard  deviation  in prostate  tissue  without  focal radiotracer  uptake.  Mean  
and maximum  standardized  uptake  values  will be recorded  for each  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_594698].  We 
will use ROC  analysis  to determine  the sensitivity/specificity  for prostate  cancer  detection  by [CONTACT_594719]  ―positivity ‖. Quantitative  thresholds  will be based  
on SUVs  as well as lesion -to-background  ratios.  In addition  to this analysis  of the prostate,  focal 
68Ga-RM2 uptake  in lymph  nodes,  bones  or other  organs  that is not explained  by [CONTACT_594720].  
MRI.  Standard  of care MRI studies  at the Department  of radiology  are performed  using  a 3T whole - 
body unit. Transverse  T1-weighted  and transverse,  coronal,  and sagittal  T2-weighted  fast spin-echo  
sequences  are obtained.  Diffusion -weighted  MRI is acquired  in the transverse  plane  using  a single  
shot spin-echo  echo-planar  imaging  sequence  with multiple  b-values  (b 0-1000).  Dynamic  contrast - 
enhanced  MRI is performed  using  a transverse  3D T1-weighted  spoiled  gradient -echo  sequence  
with a temporal  resolution  <7 seconds.  Images  are acquired  after i.v. injection  of 0.1 mmol/kg  body 
weight  gadolinium -DTPA  at a rate of 2 mL/s.Based  on these  images  the likelihood  of prostate  will be 
scored  on a 5-point scale  as described  in several  previous  publication  of the Department  of 
Radiology,  for example   (29).  Screening

each prostate region but now based on the combined information from the PET and MRI. This 
analysis  is performed  in order  to evaluate  if the combination  of PET and MR imaging  is more  
accurate  than PET and MR alone.  Since  combined  PET/MR  scanners  have recently  been  
introduced  it is clinically  relevant  to evaluate  if the combination  of 68 Ga-RM2-PET and MR is 
potentially  more  accurate  for detection  of prostate  cancer  than either   68Ga-RM2-PET/CT  or MR 
alone.  
 
11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Risks  
 
68Ga-RM2  PET/CT  Scans  
 
As part of this scan there  is radiation  delivered  from the [ADDRESS_784590] scan that 
are performed  as part of the PET/CT  for attenuation  correction  and co-registration.  Although  any 
exposure  to ionizing  radiation  has the potential  to cause  some  harm  to tissue,  the radiation  
exposures  in this study  are comparable  to the low-level exposures  associated  with common  
diagnostic  procedures  such as CT scanning.  There  remains  a low theoretical  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a 
cancer  at some  point later in life as a result  of the radiation  exposure  received  in this study.  This risk 
is much  smaller  than the clinical  risks posed  by [CONTACT_102]‘s  current  cancer.  Participants  should  not 
father  a baby  [CONTACT_120175].  Acceptable  birth control  methods  include  abstinence,  double  
barrier  method,  surgically  sterilized  patient  or partner.  
RM2 
 
A recent study of 6 8Ga-RM2 in 5 normal male volunteers reported no drug related adverse effects 
after administration  of up to 28 µg 68 Ga-RM2 (26) . There  were  also no drug related  adverse  effects  
in a study  of 14 patients  with prostate  cancer  imaged  with 68Ga-RM2 (27). Other  non-radioactive  
GRPr  antagonists  have been  studied  for treatment  of prostate  cancer  and were  well tolerated  at 
several  degrees  of magnitude  higher  doses.  In a phase  I study  the GRPr  antagonists  RC3095  was 
administered  at doses  ranging  from 8-96 µg/kg once  or twice  daily,  i.e. approximately  560 µg/day  – 
[ZIP_CODE]  µg/day.  In this study  the only discomfort  observed  was local discomfort  at the injection  site. 
There  is a potential  small  risk of infection  at the site of injection.

Safety  Outcome  Measures  (CTCAE  v4) 
Infusion  Reaction  
Patients  will be monitored  during  and after 68 Ga-RM2 infusion  for 120 minutes   after the infusion.  
The safety  and tolerability  of 68Ga-RM2 w i l l  be assessed  using  the following  primary  safety  
outcome  measure:  
 
• Incidence,   nature,  and severity  of adverse  events  up to 1 day following  peptide  
administration.  
• Change  in vital signs  during  administration

Primary  objective  (specific  aim 1) 
 
The primary  objective  of this proposal  is to estimate  the sensitivity  and specificity  of PET using  a 
gastrin  releasing  peptide  receptor  antagonist  for localizing  tumors  of the prostate.  Localization  will be 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -146 A(5)  
Approval date: 05 -Sep-2018   
 
 
defined  using  a total of 12 regions  within  the prostate:  right and left base,  midgland  and apex in both 
peripheral  and transition  zones.  The uptake  on each  region  will be assessed  by a radiologist  blinded  
to standard  of care imaging  and clinical  characteristics.  Histopathological  confirmation  will be used  
as the gold standard.  
 
Unit of analysis  will be region  and the correlation  between  regions  of the same  prostate  will be 
handled  statistically  using  a variance  inflation  factor  (VIF)  as described  before  (44). Primary  analysis  
will involve  an ROC  curve  for the uptake  and calculation  of the area under  it. We will also report  
sensitivity  and specificity  in selected  operating  points  from the ROC  curve.  With 20 patients  and a 
total of 240 regions  we will be able to estimate  the sensitivity  to within  approximately  +/- 11.4%  and 
specificity  to within  +/- 8.1%  with 95% confidence.  These  calculations  are informed  by a recent  
investigation  of the use of 3T DW-MR imaging  for the same  disease  at our institution  (29). 
Specifically  we used  presumed  values  of 65% and 80% for sensitivity  and specificity  respectively,  a 
VIF of 1.22 and a region -based  prevalence  of 40% which  corresponds  to approximately  100 tumor - 
bearing  regions.  
Secondary  objective  1 (specific  aim 2) 
 
We will construct  ROC  curves  separately  for PET and MR, based  on blinded  five-point  scale  
readings  using  histopathology  as the gold standard.  Curves  will be compared  using  the Obuchowski  
method  adjusted  for clustering.  We will also dichotomize  the readings  (0 and 1 as negative,  and 2 or 
up as positive)  and compare  sensitivity  and specificity  of standard  of care MR imaging  with PET 
using  a McNemar‘s  test adjusted  for multiple  regions.  The same  comparisons  will also be made  for 
the joint analysis  of PET and MR imaging  vs. PET alone  and MR imaging  alone,  respectively.  
 
With [ADDRESS_784596]  approximately  80% power  to detect  an 
absolute  difference  of 10% (e.g. 65% vs 75%)  between  the sensitivities  and specificities  (45) while  
controlling  the Type  I error rate at 5%. 
Secondary  objective  2 (specific  aim 2) 
 
Because  of the limited  knowledge  on the relationship  between  uptake  of 68Ga-RM2 on the hand  and 
AR  signaling   and  ETS  rearrangements   on  the  other   hand,   we  will  perform   descriptive,  
hypothesis  generating  analyses  for this aim. Specifically,  we will determine  the 68Ga-RM2 SUVs  for 
tumors  with and without  ETS rearrangement,  AR amplification,  AR gene  expression  signature,  and 
PTEN  loss in a descriptive  fashion.  We will also study  the relationship  between  SUVs   and 
semiquantitative   immunohistochemical   parameters,  such   as  GRPr   and  nuclear   AR  expression  
levels  using  Spearman  rank correlation.  
Exploratory  analyses  
 
Detection  of lymph  node  metastases  
 
The frequency  of lymph  node  and distant  metastases  in the studied  patient  population  is expected  to 
be small  (a total of 20 patients  will be studied,  only 6 of whom  will be high risk patients).  Therefore,  
sensitivity  and specificity  for detection  metastatic  disease  will only be recorded  in a descriptive  way 
and not further  analyzed.  
Safety  and tolerability  of 68Ga-RM2  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -146 A(5)  
Approval date: 05 -Sep-2018   
 
 
The safety  and tolerability  of 68Ga-RM2 will be assessed  using  the following  primary  safety  outcome  
measures:  Incidence  and nature  of DLTs;  incidence,  nature,  and severity  of adverse  events;  and 
change  in vital signs  and clinical  laboratory  results.  Incidence  and severity  of DLTs  and adverse  
events  will be estimated  with sample  proportions  and 95% confidence  intervals  while  changes  in 
vital signs  and laboratory  parameters  will be tested  using  the signed -ranks  test and summarized  with 
descriptive  statistics.

16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The data and safety  monitoring  (DSM) plans  at MSKCC  were  approved  by [CONTACT_594723]  2001.  The plans  address  the policies  set forth by [CONTACT_594724] , which  can be found  at http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/clinicaltrials . The DSM  
plans  at MSKCC  were  established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  The 
MSKCC  DSM  plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:  
http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/html/[ZIP_CODE].cfm . 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  safety,  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff  
education  on clinical  research  quality  assurance)  and departmental  procedures  for quality  
control,  and there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the 
activities  of our clinical  trials  programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  
Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  
Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the MSKCC  Research  Council  and 
Institutional  Review  Board.  
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed,  
and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.

the suspected  relationship  to the study  drug.  Any SAE occurring  more  than 30 days after the 
PET/CT  scan must  be reported  if a causal  relationship  is suspected.  
 
When  accounting  for many  tests  per year,  the radiation  doses  (on the order  of 20 mSv)  lie well 
within  the ―low-dose ‖ range —well below  the threshold  doses  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_594701] 1000  mSv 
or greater)  for any known  deterministic  effects.  A detailed  description  of the expected  dosimetry  
from the 68Ga-RM2 has been  published.  The dose  of 68 Ga-RM2 per administration  (150-200 
MBq)  gives  the lowest  amount  that would  be consistent  with the research  goal. Lower  doses  of 
radioactivity  would  limit image  quality  and will limit the detectably  of prostate  cancer  on PET.  
17.3.2  Grading  Severity  
 
All adverse  events  will be graded  for intensity  on a scale  of 0 to 5. Severity  grades  will be 
recorded  and based  on the CTCAE  v4.0. 
17.3.3  Attributing Causality 
 
The investigator  will evaluate  the potential  relationship  between  all clinical  AEs, abnormal  
laboratory  values,  and the 68 Ga-RM2, and categorize  the relationship  according  to the 
descriptions  in Table  5. Abnormal  laboratory  values  of clinical  significance  that were  present  at 
baseline  and did not change  in either  severity  or frequency  during  the experimental  therapy  or 
intervention  and/or  that can obviously  be attributed  to the underlying  disease  will be evaluated  by

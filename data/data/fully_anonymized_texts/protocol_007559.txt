Veterans 
 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_2267] H. Dillon, Ph.D. 
 SPONSOR/FUNDING SOURCE:  HSR&D SPRINT Planning Grant  
 Purpose The goal of this research is to develop, refi ne, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-test a mobile interpretation bias 
modification intervention to reduce cognitions that contribute to elevated suicide risk and to assess the impact of reductions in suicide cognitions and hostile interpretation bias on suicide risk and functioning.  Background and Significance According to the fluid vulnerability theory, suicide risk fluctuates as a function of chronic and acute vulnerability factors.
1 One of the factor s that contributes to persistent 
vulnerability is what is known as a “suicidal belief system”.[ADDRESS_441286], thwarted belong ingness, unlovability, and 
unbearability were uniquely related to prospecti ve attempts over a two-year period, 
above and beyond other well-es tablished risk factors.4 Suicide cognitions are 
conceptualized as enduring, chronic vulnerabilit y factors that predispose individuals to 
suicidal crises. Therefore, modification of these beliefs may reduce suicidal thoughts 
and behaviors.  
 
In addition to suicide cognitions, another potent ially modifiable risk factor for suicide is 
anger. Recent research (including from our team) has demonstrated a strong, 
consistent relationship between anger and suicidal thought s and behaviors in civilian 
and veteran samples.7-[ADDRESS_441287]. 
Dillon has developed an app to deliver her hostile interpretation bias modification 
intervention with ~[ADDRESS_441288] of this intervention as well as the 
hostile interpretation bias intervention on su icide risk and daily functioning will be 
examined.  
Mobile Intervention for Suicide Cognitions 
Research Protocol, Version Date: 3/27/23      Page 2 of 18 Aims 
Aim 1(a). Develop a mobile interpretation  bias modification intervention entitled 
Mobile Intervention for Suicidal Thought s (MIST) to reduce cognitions that 
contribute to elevated suicide risk.  We will develop content to target cognitive factors 
that contribute to suicide risk and program th is content into a mobile application similar 
to an existing app developed by [CONTACT_354251], entitled 
MIRA.  
 
Aim 1(b). Use a suc cessive cohort design to refine the MIST intervention among 
Veterans with PTSD, problematic ange r, and elevated suicidal ideation. To refine 
the intervention developed in Aim 1(a), t he app will be tested in two cohorts (each n = 5) 
of Veterans with problematic anger, and suici dal ideation. After each cohort uses the 
MIST application for four weeks, a quant itative and qualitative evaluation will be 
conducted with each Veteran. Revisions wil l be conducted before the next cohort is 
treated. Then, a third cohort ( n = 4) will be recruited to test  a web-based version of the 
MIST intervention delivered via Qualtrics. 
 
Aim 2. Assess the impact of  reductions in suicide cognitions and hostile 
interpretation bias on suicide risk and functioning. After using the MIST intervention 
for four weeks, participants will use the MARI  intervention for another four weeks. For 
the duration of the study (all eight weeks of  treatment), EMA data  will be collected to 
evaluate the impact of both interventions  on suicide risk and daily functioning.  
Design The proposed research project has two aims: 1) to develop and refine the MIST mobile 
intervention; and 2) to assess the impact of reductions in suicide cognitions and hostile 
interpretation bias on suicide risk and func tioning among Veterans with problematic 
anger, and elevated suicidal ideation. The project has been designed in order to 
complete both aims simultaneously. The first st ep is to develop traini ng scenarios for the 
MIST intervention. [CONTACT_2337] has already started developi[INVESTIGATOR_354237]: unbearability ( I can’t tolerate being this upset ), unlovability ( I am unworthy of 
love), unsolvability ( Nothing can solve my problems ), thwarted belongingness (I do not 
belong), perceived burdensomeness ( Others are better off without me ), and 
hopelessness about the future ( Things will not improve ). Unique scenarios will be 
developed for 28 treatment sessions (daily  sessions for four weeks). When the 
scenarios have been developed, they will be reviewed by a team of experts (i.e., doctoral level psychologists with experience working with this Veteran population) who 
will rate them on how relevant they are fo r the Veteran population. They will also share 
comments and suggestions for refining these sc enarios. Each scenario will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_354252]. Scenarios with low rele vance will be revised before inclusion in 
the app. These are the same procedures used to develop the content for the MARI app.  
 
In order to refine the MIST mobile intervention, a successive cohort design11 will be 
used. Successive cohort design utilizes an it erative process for by [CONTACT_354253]. 
Qualitative and quantitative data collected by [CONTACT_354254], Version Date: 3/27/23      Page 3 of 18 cohorts is used to inform these revisions. Accordingly, we will be refining the treatment 
approach with two successive cohorts of n= [ADDRESS_441289] cohor t uses the applicati on, a qualitative and 
quantitative evaluation will be conducted. Revisions will then be made based on these evaluations before another cohort of n  = [ADDRESS_441290] cohort ( n=4) using 
the web-based version of the MI ST intervention delivered via Qualtrics. This intervention 
will include the same MIST treatment scenarios and EMA questionnaires delivered via 
Qualtrics links directly to the Veterans’ phones. 
 Procedures:  All study procedures can be completed remotely using video conferencing 
services and mailings to minimize potential COVID-[ADDRESS_441291] to revi sions includes IBM content (e.g., topi[INVESTIGATOR_354238]). After t he final cohort is completed, the MIST intervention will be 
finalized.   Measures:  The following self-report measures wil l be administered at pre-treatment, 
post-MIST, and post-MA RI assessments: suicide cognitions  will be assessed with the 
Suicide Cognitions Scale4, Beck Hopelessness Scale12, Interpersonal Needs 
Questionnaire13; hostile interpretation bias  will be assessed with the Word Sentence 
Association Paradigm-Hostility14; suicide risk  will be assessed with the C-SSRS15 and 
the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation; anger  will be assessed with the Dimensions of 
Anger Reactions16; functioning and quality of life will be assessed with the Brief 
Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (IPF)[ADDRESS_441292] for DSM- 5, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and a 
Mobile Intervention for Suicide Cognitions 
Research Protocol, Version Date: 3/27/23      Page 4 of 18 brief questionnaire to assess their self-eff icacy at managing suicidal thoughts and 
anger. On a 1-5 Likert scale they will be asked to rate: “how confident are you with your 
ability to cope with suicidal thoughts?” and “ how confident are you with your ability to 
cope with anger?”. At the pos t-MIST and post-MIRA assessm ents, they will complete 
the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire. 
 EMA assessments will also be conducted for the duration of the time  that participants 
are engaged in the MIST and MARI intervent ions (8 weeks). T here will be one random 
alarm-prompted diary entry during the day  and a nightly diary using established 
procedures from our team.
19,20 The EMA diary will include assessments of: suicidal 
ideation; and functioning and health re lated quality of life  using the brief IPF21 and items 
from the WHOQOL-BREF18. EMA entries will also ask about affect and alcohol and 
substance use.

Mobile Device Use 
Study participants will access the MI ST, MARI, and EMA interventions and 
assessments using their personal mobile devic es. They will receive Qualtrics links to 
access the treatment sessions and EMA diary entries. These data will be collected via the VA instance of Qualtrics.    
Risk/Benefit Assessment 
Mobile Intervention for Suicide Cognitions 
Research Protocol, Version Date: 3/27/[ADDRESS_441293] udy at any time. Regarding 
qualitative data, participant s will be informed that a ll published results will be 
anonymized, including any mention of city/medical center/clinic to protect the identity of 
participants.  Potential risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_354255]/exclusion criteria, closel y monitoring symptom levels, and following 
established laboratory procedur es. To ensure confidentiality,  all records will be identified 
by [CONTACT_2299]’s identification number, not by [CONTACT_2300]. All raw hard copy data will be 
kept in a locked file cabinet in a lock ed room. Data files will be stored on secure, 
password-protected com puters. Finally, all project staf f will complete educational units 
required by [CONTACT_354256].   While participants may benefit from using t he mobile intervention, there are no 
guaranteed benefits to the individual participant and no i mmediate benefits of the 
proposed research to others. T here are potential benefits to others from the information 
generated that potentially will be helpful in increasing reach of treatments to target suicidal ideation and anger and developi[INVESTIGATOR_354239], PTSD , and problematic anger. In our opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the anticipated 
benefits of this study out weigh the potential risks. 
 Selection of Subjects 
We will screen up to 30 participants for the projec t for a desired total sample size of 14.

Mobile Intervention for Suicide Cognitions 
Research Protocol, Version Date: 3/27/23      Page 6 of 18 training videotapes, and co-rating training with  an experienced rater. Across previous 
studies, interrater reliability based on vi deotapes of participant interviews has been 
excellent (kappa = .96). 
 Subject Recruitment Participants will be recruited using a Data Access Request Tracker (DART) request to identify Veterans with PTSD diagnoses from Regional and/or Corporate Data Warehouse. Potential participants will be sent an introductory letter that describes the 
study and informs them that they will be call ed regarding participati on. In the letter, 
potential participants will be gi ven an “opt-out” number to call in order to decline 
participation and/or further c ontact regarding participation.  Seven business days after 
the mailing, Veterans who have not called the toll-free number to decline participation will be contact[CONTACT_426] a study team member to request their participation in the research study.   We will also recruit veterans from the Traumatic Stress and Health Laboratory’s 
“Contact [CONTACT_2302],” IRB #1080; this database contains information about previous lab 
study participants who have agreed to be cont acted about other studies for which they 
may qualify.   Clinicians in clinics throughout the medica l center will be provided information about 
study eligibility and basic procedures (see brochure), and will be asked to refer potentially eligible veterans. Clinicians have r eported that Veterans often indicate that 
they prefer that their names and contact [CONTACT_68799].  
We’d like to make it easy for interested Ve terans to get involved in research, while 
protecting the privacy of those Veterans w ho are not interested in research. Towards 
that end, we would like to allow a clinician to  refer a participant directly to our clinic by 
[CONTACT_2306] [INVESTIGATOR_354240] c oordinator as a co-signer to a note in CPRS in which the 
clinician has documented that the participant wishes to be contact[CONTACT_2307].  Any Veteran who contacts or is contact[CONTACT_2308], and they may choose not to answer any questions that they find too sensitive. Also, Veterans will be told t hat their participation will not affect their 
care at the VA. The study team member will explain the study in detail, including 
compensation. No study proc edures will begin until formal, wr itten informed consent and 
HIPAA authorization have been obtained.  
 Study Interventions Two interventions will be studied in the current project, the MARI and the MIST 
interventions. The MARI intervention has already been developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dillon (IRB # 
2168). The MIST intervention is going to  be developed in a similar manner. The 
interventions will be very similar except for the content of the treatment sessions. Below, 
we explain the layout of the MARI inte rvention and then the changes that will be made 
for the MIST intervention.  
Mobile Intervention for Suicide Cognitions 
Research Protocol, Version Date: 3/27/23      Page 7 of 18 MARI Intervention.   
The IBM intervention. The IBM 
treatment works as follows (see Figure 
6). Participants are shown ambiguous, anger-relevant scenarios and instructed to imagine themselves in the described situation. For example, “You speak to someone and they do not respond.” Next, another sentence appears that offers a benign, non-threatening interpretation of the scenario. For example, the sentence following this particular scenario reads, “This person is unaw_re.” The participants fill in the missing letter of the word, forming the word “unaware,” and assigning the benign inte rpretation. This interpretation is then 
reinforced by [CONTACT_354257] “yes” or “no” to a 
comprehension question (i.e., “Did this person hear  you?”). In this example, they must 
answer “no” to proceed. Across treatment  sessions, unique scenarios are presented 
(i.e., participants do not see the same sc enario twice). Scenario s have been developed 
to capture a wide range of different themes that are likely to be anger-provoking. 
Themes include: physical aggression, drivin g situations, irritating traits of 
others, thinking you are being ignored by [CONTACT_2312], feeling argued with or 
criticized, thinking someone is stealing from you, having people block you, thinking that 
others have hostile feelings, feeling disr espected, thinking that people will not help 
you, thinking that others do not appreciate y ou, and thinking that situations are unfair. 
See Figure [ADDRESS_441295] been reviewed by  9 PTSD experts in the field and 

Mobile Intervention for Suicide Cognitions 
Research Protocol, Version Date: 3/27/23      Page 8 of 18 individuals with PTSD to confirm the content is relevant to this patient population. 
Additionally, the reading level has been asse ssed using an online readability calculator 
(“Readability Formulas”) and all scenarios are at a 6th grade reading level or less. 
Qualtrics will time stamp use by  [CONTACT_354258]. 
   MIST Intervention 
The MIST intervention will be identical to the MARI intervention. The only difference is 
that the treatment sessions  will include the scenarios t hat are being developed (see 
Design section) to target su icide cognitions.  For example,  “You make a mistake.” Next, 
another sentence appears that offe rs a resolution to the scenario that is incompatible 
with the suicide cognition being targeted (in this example, unsolvability). The sentence 
following this particular scenario reads, “I t can be fi_ed.” The participants fill in the 
missing letter of the word, forming the word “fixed,” and resolving the scenario in a way 
to change the targeted suicidal cognition. This is then reinforced by [CONTACT_354259] “yes” or “no”  to a comprehension q uestion (i.e., “Are 
things permanently damaged?”). In this exampl e, they must answer “no” to proceed. 
 
Staff Readiness to Handle Potential Disruptive Behavior Principal investigators in the Traumatic Stress and Health Research Laboratory have 
been working with Veterans with PTSD since t he mid-1990s, and much of their clinical 
and research work has involved providing anger  interventions to these Veterans. Our 
laboratory currently has three other studies in  which we provide anger interventions to 
Veterans with PTSD (IRB #s 1731, 2063, and 2168). Over the course of those studies, 
we have not had any need to report any disruptive behaviors or contact [CONTACT_2316]. [CONTACT_2337], recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_354241]-based hostile interpretation bias intervention (IRB # 2136) and is currently conducting another study of the mobile hostile interpretation bias intervention (IRB # 2168). She has not had any Veterans express anger regarding the intervention.  
 Senior staff members are well trained in utilization of counseling techniques such as 
active listening, which helps to minimize the likelihood of angry outbursts. Study staff members are asked to attend levels 2 and 3 of the VA’s Preventio n and Management of 
Disruptive Behavior (PMDB) training, which is the VA’s workplace violence prevention 
program. This level of training is the highest offered to  VA employees in outpatient 
settings. Finally, office areas that are used for clinical interventions, interviews, etc. are 
equipped with panic alarms, and staff are trained in how/when to use the alarms.   Costs and/or Payments to Subjects The study involves up to three visits. Pa rticipants who are screened and found ineligible 
for the study will receive $40 for their time. Eligible participants will receive $[ADDRESS_441296] visit, $[ADDRESS_441297] visit, $[ADDRESS_441298] scenarios, and $[ADDRESS_441299]-MIRA visit. They 
will also be paid for completing the EMA monito ring for the 8-week dur ation of the study. 
Mobile Intervention for Suicide Cognitions 
Research Protocol, Version Date: 3/27/23      Page 9 of 18 They will receive $30 for each week that they do the EMA monitoring (8 weeks total) 
plus a $[ADDRESS_441300] 2/3rds of the prompted diaries. Participants can receive up to $625 for completion  of the study.  
 Data and Safety Monitoring The PI [INVESTIGATOR_354242] r data safety and monitoring. There will be 
several ongoing mechanisms for monitoring and reporting of AEs: 1) ongoing participant 
contact [CONTACT_2317], 2) a toll-free number provided to participants to report concerns related to study participation; 3) weekly meetings between the PIs and study 
personnel. Study-related serious adverse event s (SAEs) for participants in this project 
are not expected, but should t hey occur, they will be reported to the Durham VA Health 
Care System Institutional Review Board in accordance with local human protections 
program guidelines.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_354243] w eekly with study personnel to discuss participants’ reactions 
to the intervention, proper delivery of the intervention,  and any adverse events or 
unanticipated problems. Monthl y meetings between the investigators and the project 
manager will allow for ongoing pr ogress reports, including the number of participants 
currently involved in the study, attriti on rates, and scheduled data collection from 
participants, as well as notification and review  of any AEs. Safety monitoring for AEs will 
be conducted in real time by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or  project manager. The following information 
about adverse events will be coll ected: 1) the onset and re solution of the AE, 2) an 
assessment of the severity or intensity (u se existing grading scales whenever possible), 
3) an assessment of the relati onship of the event to the study (definitely, probably, 
possibly or not related), and 4) action taken (e.g., none, referral to physician, start or 
increase concomitant medication). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_2279], will 
assign attribution to the event, and will monitor the event until its resolution. Any adverse events will be reported to the IR B in accordance with the local Human 
Research Protection Program’s Standards of Practice. All research projects conducted 
at the Durham VAHCS are required to have yearly IRB review. Reports of non-serious 
AEs are required as part of these progre ss reports. Additionally, any changes to the 
project between review periods must be app lication by [CONTACT_2318]. 
 Withdrawal of Participants The PI [INVESTIGATOR_354244] y, or unwillingness, to complete study 
procedures or attend appointments.  COVID-19 Temporary Study Procedures The informed consent process will occur ov er the phone or via an approved telehealth 
platform. Potential participants will be mail ed the consent and HIPAA authorization, and 
a study staff member will call them to di scuss the consent and HIPAA. Participants will 
be asked to return the signed consents by [CONTACT_2319]/UPS.   Study visits will be completed via an approved telehealth platform, with phone as a back-up measure. If the study staff member has access to Audacity via 
CAG,he/she/they will record the interviews (think-aloud and post-treatment qualitative 
Mobile Intervention for Suicide Cognitions 
Research Protocol, Version Date: 3/27/23      Page 10 of 18 interview) directly to the VA secured server (in lieu of videorecording with an external 
device). If telehealth visits are done using VA’s  instance of WebEx, audiorecordings will 
be done to the VA WebEx cloud and moved as soon as possible to the VA secured 
server. Questionnaires will be completed ora lly, by [CONTACT_2319], and/or via MyHealthyVet.  
 We would like to ask participants to complete  measures related to stress, trauma, and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_2281]. New par ticipants will complete these measures 
at their first visit, and ongoing participants will complete them at their next study visit. 
We are adding the CAIR Pandemic Impact Questionnaire (Lang, 2020; https://www.nlm.nih.gov/dr2/CAIR-PIQ_scoring.pdf ), and another measure, COVID 
Core Questions, with variables of interes t. If a participant endorses any item marked 
with an asterisk on the COVID Core Questions measure, we will ask them to complete a 
PTSD Checklist [ADDRESS_441301] not added them to the 
consent form. Instead, participants will be info rmed verbally re: t he measures, and will 
be told that they can refuse to answer them.  Safety Concerns.  Study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_354245] c ontact for the participant to be used 
only in true emergencies (e.g., medical cris is, high risk suicidal ideation). If any 
participant expresses suicidal or homicidal i deation (SI and HI, respectively), study staff 
will respond using a standard of practice that has been used successfully in our lab’s past telehealth-based trials. The study staf f member responsible for the call will be 
instructed to gather more information from the participant, including information about 
plan, means, intent, intended vi ctim (in the case of HI) and history of suicidal and 
homicidal behavior. Any participant who expr essed SI will be provided with the suicide 
hotline number. The parti cipant will be informed t hat the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2283]/her to talk 
more about his/her SI or HI. The study coordinator will obtai n current contact 
[CONTACT_2320], who will contact [CONTACT_2321]. In cases of imminent homicidality or suicidality, 
which are not anticipated, we will seek gui dance from the Psychia tric Emergency Clinic 
on best strategies for follow-up, which coul d include, but is not limited to, self-
presentation at the VA’s em ergency room with the help of an emergency contact, calling 
911, or calling local police  for a wellness check.  
 Study Communication. For any participant who indica tes that they are willing to 
receive study communications via email, we will use Azure to send secure 
communications to them re: appointment scheduling, missed appointments, etc. 
Content from the study’s  IRB-approved letters will be included in the emails. 
Data Analysis and Statis tical Considerations 
Rapid turn-around analysis of the qualitative interviews wil l be conducted according to 
methods described by [CONTACT_134012].
[ADDRESS_441302] app, feedback 
on the content of the scenar ios, usability of the app, perceived strengths and 
weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_354246].  
Mobile Intervention for Suicide Cognitions 
Research Protocol, Version Date: 3/27/23      Page 11 of 18 Recognizing that it is inappropriate to examine efficacy in a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], we will focus 
on feasibility and acceptability objectives.24 As appropriate for this  stage of treatment 
development and evaluation, analysis and interpretation will focus on describing the primary outcomes: acceptability of the inte rvention and feasibility of  the trial approach. 
Additionally, although we will not be able to  statistically analyze changes in suicide 
cognitions and hostile interpretation bias , we will describe the changes including 
whether they were observed in the expected directions.  Data will be analyzed using SAS. In the event that required SAS modules are not 
available at VINCI, deidentified data will be mo ved to Duke University Medical Center 
for analysis. Any data movement outside the protected VA env ironment will be 
accomplished using a VA-issued and own ed FIPS-140-[ADDRESS_441303] access; data are encrypted at rest.  Multilevel modeling (MLM) will be used to analyze  the EMA data. MLM is a technique 
for analyzing repeated observations of data acro ss multiple individuals. Unlike repeated-
measures ANOVA, MLM can incorporate time -varying and time-invariant predictors to 
model between-person differences in withi n-person relationships. MLM can also 
accommodate imbalanced data and unequal vari ances. To examine the association 
between app use on suicide risk and functioning (Aim 2), three models will be analyzed 
in which each of the continuous outco me variables recorded during EMA will be 
modeled via MLM during each of the 4-week intervention periods as a function of 
frequency of app use.

4. Location of Data and/or Specime ns, and Data Retention Plan:   
A. Data and/or Specimen Location:  Data will be stored electronically in 
\\VHADURFPC02B\groups1\Nicotine Res earch\Study Information\Study 
Logbooks\Kirsten SPRINT and \\VHADURFPC02B\groups1\Nic otine Research\Study 
Information\Study Databases\Kirsten SPRINT.  Data that will be stored electronically 
include name, address, phone number, social  security number, amount of study 
payment earned, and date of visits (in St udy Logbooks location). The study logbook will 
contain the key connecting PHI and the study identification number. Paper records of 
data include study consent form and HIPAA authorization (identifi ed), questionnaire 
responses, and interview notes (coded). Audi o recordings will be made using Audacity 
or WebEx. Any recordings made using WebE x will be transferred from the cloud to the 
“Study Logbooks” location listed above for l ong term storage, audio recordings may be 
moved to an encrypted DVD that is passwor d-protected. Any encrypted DVDs will be 
stored in a locked filing cabinet in a lock ed office.  Transcriptions from the study 
interviews will be stored electr onically at the Study Logbooks location listed above. Data 
will also be stored within VA Qualtrics, which is FedRAMP approved for collection and storage of PHI and sensitive information, and has an Authority to Operate (ATO) within 
VA. Data will be moved from Qualtrics \\VHADURFPC02B\groups1\Nicotine Research\Study Information\Study Databas es\Kirsten SPRINT for permanent storage.  
  Data will be also be placed at the VA Info rmatics and Computing Interface (VINCI; 
http://vaww.vinci.med.va.gov/v incicentral/VINCIWorkspace.aspx ). The VA Informatics 
and Computing Infrastructure is a partner ship between the VA Office of Information 
Technology and the Veterans’ Health Admi nistration Office of Research and 
Development.  Researchers and operations staff can use VINCI to access data and 
statistical analysis tools in a virtual wo rking environment through a certified VHA 
network computer using the VA Intranet or Virtual Private Network (VPN).  
B. Data Retention Plan 
 Research records will be maintained and destroyed according to the National 
Archives and Records Administration, Records Schedule Number:  DAA-0015-2015-
0004.  Records destruction, when authorized, will be accomplished using the then current requirements for the secure disposal  of paper and electronic records.  Currently, 
destruction of research records (see D AA-0015-2015-0004, sect ion 7.6 “Research 
Investigator Files” for mate rials included in research records) is scheduled for 6 years 
after the cut-off (the cut-off is the completion of the rese arch project) and may be 
retained longer if required by  [CONTACT_2326].  Records will not be destroyed 
without pre-notification to the facility records manager. 
  Other data retention plan, describe:

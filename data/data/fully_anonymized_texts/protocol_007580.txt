General Information  Protocol Title: Safety, Efficacy, and Changes in Traditional and Novel Biomarkers of Kidney Function in Patients with Hepatitis C and Chronic Kidney Disease treated with Viekira Pak or Mavyret  Date: 9/25/19  Primary Investigators: Raymond Chung, MD Associate [CONTACT_697177], Hepatology, [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [EMAIL_13318] [PHONE_14498]  Meghan Sise, MD, MS Instructor Harvard Medical School Division of Nephrology, [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [EMAIL_13319] [PHONE_14499]    Section 2.  Background information  Rationale and Background Information: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected individuals. Between 55-85% of HCV infected patients with cirrhosis have some form of glomerular disease on kidney biopsy.[1, 2] It is well established that HCV increases the risk of progressive CKD; patients with HCV are 34-68% more likely to develop end-stage-renal disease (ESRD) than non-infected patients.[3-5] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_697164] [ADDRESS_946317] on historical and novel biomarkers of CKD and renal inflammation. Historically, achieving sustained virologic response (SVR), with pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy has been shown to improve kidney function and decrease the rate of progression of CKD.[6-10] The mechanism behind the link between HCV infection and CKD progression is not fully understood, but likely involves promotion of insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and the potential for immune complex deposition in the glomerulus of the kidney. The new era of DAA therapy allows for the opportunity to better characterize the mechanisms that promote CKD by [CONTACT_697170]. We hypothesize that patients with advanced CKD will demonstrate improvement in proteinuria and eGFR after viral eradication with either Viekira Pak or Mavyret per current standard of care guidelines found at HCVguidelines.org.  
The new era of HCV therapy allows us to test the reversibility of the association between HCV infection and CKD. Our data in patients with cryoglobulinemia shows that patients with active glomerulonephritis treated with novel direct antiviral agents (DAA) had a 70% reduction in proteinuria and a 12.6mL/min improvement in eGFR by [CONTACT_41573]12 [11]. Reduction in proteinuria is an important component of the definition of clinical remission in treatment of glomerular diseases and a widely accepted surrogate for CKD progression.[12, 13] Cystatin-C based eGFR estimates have been shown to outperform creatinine-based estimates in terms of predicting cardiovascular events and mortality; this is likely related to the fact that in addition to measuring kidney function, serum cystatin-C also reflects the inflammatory milieu.[14-18] Urine studies, such as albuminuria and proteinuria are heavily relied on by [CONTACT_697171]. Albuminuria is common in HCV infection, however it is typi[INVESTIGATOR_697165], nor routinely monitored in patients with HCV infection undergoing therapy.[19, 20] Citations for the rational for measuring novel CKD biomarkers are listed below.  It is well established that HCV infection is a risk factor for CKD progression. We propose that this data could serve as the basis to support further study into the role of HCV eradication to slow CKD progression in patients with HCV. If HCV is a reversible risk factor for progressive CKD, then the implications of this finding will be far-reaching. Slowing progression of kidney disease is a critical goal in the field of nephrology, as the increasing incidence and prevalence of advanced CKD and ESRD places significantly increased health burden on patients and tremendous costs on our health-care system.    Section 3. Core Protocol  3.1 Study Objectives and Purpose:  The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of HCV eradication with Viekira Pak or Mavyret for adults with CKD with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 15-60 ml/min that are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-6, to determine the effect of treatment on traditional and novel markers of kidney function and cardiovascular disease risk in patients with advanced CKD. During the course of this prospective, single arm treatment trial, we will measure currently accepted markers of kidney function and novel biomarkers of CKD progression to determine if they improve with eradication of HCV.    Aim 1. Determine the effect of HCV eradication with Viekira Pak or Mavyret on traditional and novel makers of CKD progression in 10 patients with CKD (eGFR 15 - 60) who are pre-dialysis who undergo therapy of HCV infection. Measure novel biomarkers of incident and progressive CKD and liver disease to determine if eradication of HCV infection changes measures of chronic inflammation associated with progressive end-organ disease. Repeated measures will be taken at baseline and regular study intervals.  Aim 1. Determine the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and effect on quality of life of Viekira Pak or Mavyret in 10 patients with CKD (eGFR 15 – 60mL/min) who are pre-dialysis. Patient visits at baseline, week 2, 4, 8, 12, and SVR 12 to assess safety, adverse reactions, and perform measurements for Aim 1.  We hypothesize that that traditional and novel markers of CKD will improve with HCV eradiation and that Viekira Pak or Mavyret will be safe and effective and lead to improvement in quality of life in patients with advanced CKD.  
 3.2. Study Design  This will be a single arm, open-label experimental trial conducted at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. There will be no control or placebo arm. [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697166] (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 15mL/min and 60mL/min. We expect [ADDRESS_946318] stage 3b or 4 CKD (GFR 15-45) and [ADDRESS_946319] stage 3A CKD (eGFR 45-60). Due to the fact that the vast majority of patients with eGFR < 20mL/min are referred for kidney transplant evaluation and strongly encouraged to undergo transplantation from HCV infected donors prior to receiving DAA therapy in order to dramatically shorten transplant waitlist time, this pool of patients is largely left untreated at the request of our transplant center. This significantly limits our ability to recruit patients whose GFR is approaching 20mL/min. Thus, in order to complete this study in a timely fashion, we propose including patient with eGFR up to 60mL/min to improve our ability to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_697167]. Futhermore, stage 3A and 3B CKD are the stages where interventions such as eradicating HCV are most likely to be able to slow eGFR decline this is an important population to study.

Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized using standard descriptive methods and will include age, sex, and self-identified race/ethnicity. Baseline characteristic data will include body mass index, HCV RNA level (log10 IU/mL), genotype HCV infection, and additional comorbidities (cirrhosis, diabetes, hypertension, HIV infection). The number (proportion of subjects) in each genotype stratum and response to prior HCV therapy will be summarized. With N = [ADDRESS_946332] (baseline vs. SVR12 measurement). Changes from baseline to all follow-up visits of the levels of all markers in Table 1 will be assessed using a maximum-likelihood, mixed-effects repeated-measures model (MMRM) with all longitudinal observations included. The model will include terms for baseline and all subsequent visits (on-treatment, short-term and long-term follow-up). Means and 95% confidence intervals will be presented for change in markers from baseline through each follow-up visit. Analyses 
will be performed using PROC MIXED with denominator degrees of freedom estimated by [CONTACT_697175]. Covariance structure will be determined using the lowest Akaike information criterion. P values will be presented for each post-baseline visit as well as for all follow-up visits combined. In order to determine the kinetics of marker reduction, we will determine the average time in weeks until nadir. Outcomes will be checked for normality to meet the assumptions of parametric testing; appropriate transformations or non-parametric tests will be utilized. As an exploratory analysis, we will determine which pathway is the most influential on renal recovery. I will correlate improvements in eGFR and proteinuria with changes in novel biomarkers.

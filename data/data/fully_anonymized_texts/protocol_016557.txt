Research Question and Aims  
Hypothesis:  Vagal nerve stimulation improves outcomes in patients with post- COVID syndrome.  
 Aims, purpose, or objectives: 
1. To evaluate the impact of vagal nerve stimulation in the treatment of post- COVID  syndrome 
 
Background:  
 Post- COVID syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that persist greater than 28 days after the initial onset of 
symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.(1) The constellation of symptoms bears a striking resemblance to the “central sensitization syndromes”, a group that includes fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).(1, 2) This syndrome is likely to occur in upward of 10% of the population who has been infected with COVID -19, likely affecting hundreds of millions across the world.(2, 3) 
The etiology of this condition is poorly understood at this time, but it has been linked to immune dysregulation, which likely mediates its effects via neuroinflammation,  as demonstrated by [CONTACT_88344].(3 -7)  
 At this time, we have no effective treatment options for post- COVID  syndrome. Sympathetic hyperactivity has 
been a reliable feature of these central sensitization conditions and many of our treatment modalities are directed at reducing the sympathetic drive.(8) Parasympathetic nervous system activation thereby [CONTACT_88345].   The Gammacore vagal nerve stimulator has been used in several clinical settings and has demonstrated decreased frequency and severity of headaches . Some studies have also shown a decrease in fatigue. (9-11) We 
hypothesize that VNS may also decrease post- COVID  symptoms, particularly fatigue. If this proves beneficial, 
these findings could drive an individualized approach to treating post-COVID syndrome.   
Whereas multiple studies have previously described common Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) findings in 
acute COVID -19, to date no description has been made of POCUS findings in the post-COVID syndrome. In 
the acute setting, POCUS has been shown to perform similarly to CT for diagnostic and prognostic purposes 
both in COVID-[ADDRESS_96439]- COVID

Study Design and Methods  
Methods:   
 
[ADDRESS_96441]- COVID  Care Clinic (PCOCC) at the Mayo Clinic in [COMPANY_002]ster. After 
providing informed consent to this study as well as our post- COVID  patient registry and biorepository, patients 
will perform baseline clinical questionnaires including the Post-COVID Functional Status Score, PHQ- 9, GAD -
7, PROMIS-F, and COMPASS and have a blood sample taken for analysis for cytokine panel including high sensitivity IL -6, DHEA, and am cortisol.  A Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) will be performed , if one has 
not been performed clinically within the previous two weeks,  and e nrollees will have PET -CT of the brain 
performed to evaluate brain metabolism.   They will then be randomized to either receive VNS treatment or not to receive VNS treatment. For those randomized to use t he Gammacore, the device will be applied to the neck  (by [CONTACT_87755]) for 2- minute  
intervals , two sets , administered three times daily. The people who contact [CONTACT_88346]-up as part of 
the PCOCC treatment program (nurses and health coaches) will be blinded, but patients will not be blinded in this open- label  study. All  patients will complete the above questionnaires at 2, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_96442] Information

Data Analysis  
Data Analysis Plan:  
 Data will be collected and stored in a de- identified RedCAP database. Data to be abstracted from the electronic 
health record  includes demographics, medical history, and laboratory results. Experimental data will be added 
to the database as generated.   Outcomes will be compared across groups. Changes from baseline to week 12 will be analyzed using analysis of covariance, with the baseline value included as the covariate.  Distributional assumptions will be assessed and transformations or nonparametric methods used as appropriate.

 The treatment comparison for the change from baseline at Week 4 was estimated using a Mixed 
Model Repeated Measures (MMRM), which included the baseline score as a covariate; treatment 
group, visit (week), and the treatment-by-visit (week) as fixed effects; and a repeated structure that acknowledged the visits within a subject using an unstructured covariance structure. The 
Kenward-Rogers (1997) approximation was used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. The estimate, standard error, 90% CI, and associated p-value (2-sided) were presented.

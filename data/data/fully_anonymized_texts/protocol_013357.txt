Background:  
 
The team at OHSU is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a smartphone based application to provide decision support for 
patients with type 1 diabetes taking multiple daily injections and using continuous glucose 
monitoring (CGM). This smartphone application, DailyDose, will recommend changes to insulin 
doses to the user, such as adjusting the patient’s insulin to carbohydrate ratio.  The goal s of this 
study are: 1) to assess the impact of physician -driven insulin setting changes. Data gathered from 
this study will inform how much improvement in time in range can be expected over a 7 day 
period after an appropriate insulin dose change.  This information will be used to power a future 
study assessing DailyDose (a decision support tool that incorporates diabetes management 
strategies to minimize hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, especially after exercise including 
hypoglycemia the night foll owing exercise)  and 2) the collection of paired multiple daily 
injection data and CGM data in the context of everyday life and with structured exercise 
sessions. Creation of such a dataset will be extremely valuable for the ongoing development of 
the recom mendation algorithms that function within DailyDose.  
 
The recent commercialization of Inpen, which captures short -acting insulin doses, and the 
availablility of GoCaps  and Clipsulin , FDA -cleared device s, which capture multiple types of 
insulin doses inclu ding from a Lantus Solostar pen, has enabled the conduct of this type of study. 
The availability of devices such as a FitBit  or Apple Watch  allows for tracking of activity level. 
As a component of this study, subjects will wear the FDA -approved Dexcom G5  or G6 CGM 
system. The CGM values will be accessible via the Dexcom Clarity portal, which will allow 
study investigators to make insulin dose recommendations. Subjects will also wear an 
investigational Dexcom G6 sensor that includes a temperature logger that  has been developed by 
[CONTACT_720434]. (See Appendix D for letter referencing IDE).

 Primary Objective  
 The primary objective is to assess if weekly insulin dose changes by [CONTACT_720435] (Dexcom G5  or G6  CGM 70 -180 mg/dL) and decreases time in 
hypoglycemia (Dexcom G5  or G6  CGM <70 mg/dL).  
 
Study Hypothesis:  
 The study hypothesis is that weekly insulin dose changes by [CONTACT_720436].  
 
Endpoints  
Because the main purpose of the study is to refine methods and inform a formal trial, we are 
interested in point estimates (as an indication of feasibility) and within - and between -subje cts 
variability in the endpoints listed below.  
 
Primary Endpoints:  
 Time in range (70 -180 mg/dl): measured on Days 1 -7 as compared to Days 22 -28 based 
on the Dexcom G5  or G6  CGM data.  
 Time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl): measured on Days 1 -7 as compared to Days 22 -28 
based on the Dexcom G5  or G6  CGM data.  
*Note that data from Day 1 and Day 28 will not contain 24 hrs of data. The hours will be 
matched such that if for example if data on Day 1 is available starting at 10 am, data from 
Day 22 will be taken star ting at 10 am. Similarly, if data from Day 28 ends at 5 pm, the data 
from Day 7 after 5 pm will be excluded to allow for an equal comparison.  
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
 Time in significant hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dl): measured on Days 1 -7 as compared to 
Days 22 -28 based on the Dexcom G5 or G6 CGM data.  
 Mean glucose measured on Days 1 -7 as compared to Days 22 -28 based on the Dexcom 
G5 or G6  CGM data.  
 Standard deviation of glu cose measured on Days 1 -7 as compared to Days 22 -28 based 
on the Dexcom G5  or G6  CGM data.  
 Additional within -subject time effects in glucose control measures (time in range and 
time in hypoglycemia): daily variation over the 28 days of study; means for wor k 
compared to non -work days; means for days 15 -21 vs 1 -7; and in the four hours after 
initiation of exercise.  
 Sensor accuracy of the investigational Dexcom G6 sensor: mean absolute difference 
when reference capi[INVESTIGATOR_412572] ≤75 mg/dL and mean ab solute relative 
difference when reference capi[INVESTIGATOR_412572] >75 mg/dL.  
 Completeness of the investigational Dexcom G6 sensor data: Number, length, and timing 
of intervals of missing data.  
 Sequence effect: Evaluate for a trend in the intervention ef fect from the first to last 
subject.

 Study Type  
This is a single center randomized prospective study comparing time in range and time in 
hypoglycemia before insulin dosing changes as compared to after three weekly dose adjustments 
made by [CONTACT_1758] i nvestigator.  
 
Study Population  
Study population will be adults with type 1 diabetes, ages 18 – [ADDRESS_983670] in the adult population. Twenty 
four subjects will be recruited to participate in studies.   
 
Power Analysis  
A formal power analysis was not conducted. The purpose of this study is to enable an accurate 
power analysis for a subsequent study using DailyDose.  
 
Protocol Summary:  
Subjects will be on study for 28 days.  Sensor glucose, exercise, insulin and meal data  will be 
collected during this time. Subjects will wear the Dexcom G5  or G6  and G6 with temperature 
logger CGM systems and a FitBit Ionic (or similar FitBit)  or Apple Watch  physical activity 
monitor for the entire 28 days. The Dexcom G6 with temperature lo gger CGM is an 
investigational device (See Appendix D for letter referencing IDE) and will be inserted on Days 
1 and 14. Insulin data will be collected using the InPen for aspart insulin and GoCaps  or 
Clipsulin  for the long acting insulin . Subjects will co mplete 2 exercise visits in -clinic, on Days 9 
(window of days 9 -14) and 16 (window of days 16 -20). Subjects will be asked to exercise an 
additional 4 times while an outpatient: 1) Days 2 or 3, 2) Days 4 or 5, 3) Days 23 or 24 and 4) 
Days [ADDRESS_983671] s will use the T1 DEXI mobile app created by [CONTACT_720437] 28 day period. These images may be 
fed in later to Bitesnap, an application for food analysis. Subjects will be randomized to aer obic, 
anaerobic or high intensity interval exercise sessions for 30 minutes each. During the in -clinic 
exercise visits, subjects will check capi[INVESTIGATOR_30135] (CBG) before exercise, every 10 
minutes during exercise, at the end of exercise and every 15  min for an additional 30 min at the 
end of exercise. While at home, subjects will check CBG two times daily and before and after 
exercise, for symptoms of hypoglycemia, and for Dexcom G5  or G6  alarms for sensor <70 
mg/dL and >300 mg/dL. Subjects will use the Inpen dose calculator using Dexcom G5 /G6 or 
CBG values to determine aspart insulin doses for meals and correction of hyperglycemia. 
Physicians will review CGM and insulin data every [ADDRESS_983672] in the Inpen dose calculator. See Figure 1  below 
for a diagram of the study flow.  
      
A physician or nurse practitioner will be on campus for all in -clinic exercise sessions. The study 
investigators retain the authority to modify any aspects of the protocol at his/her discretion if 
he/she believes the subject’s safety is a concern.

insertion/exercise visit (Visit 2).  All screening visits will take place at O HSU’s Oregon Clinical 
Translational Research Institute (OCTRI) outpatient clinic , the Biomedical Engineering Point of 
Care (BME POC) Laboratory  or at the Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center. The subject will 
be sent the consent form prior to the screen ing by [CONTACT_720438]. Upon arrival at the clinic and prior to 
any procedures, study staff will explain the study, give the subject ample time to ask questions 
and consider participation, and ensure that subject voices understanding of the informed consent 
and study requirements. To minimize the possibility of coercion and to ensure that subject is 
signing the appropriate version of consent, an informed consent che cklist will be used by [CONTACT_38992]. After the subject has signed the consent, a copy of the consent/authorization form will be 
given to the subject. The original will be kept for the source document.

 VO 2max testing will take place at the Human Performanc e Lab, which is located within OHSU 
and is attached to the main hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. A code cart is on site within the Human Performance Lab 
and a code team is available by [CONTACT_412601]. Subjects will be asked to fast before the 
screening visit for 3 hours. A ca pi[INVESTIGATOR_30135] (CBG) will be obtained and measured by a 
Contour Next glucose meter and recorded after consenting. Prior to measurement of any blood 
samples, the meter will undergo quality control testing with two different glucose levels, one 
high a nd one low, and both values must fall within the accepted range for a meter to be used. 
After the CBG is obtained, the study investigator may adjust the subject’s basal insulin rate as 
necessary in preparation for VO 2max testing to avoid hypoglycemia.  
 
Study personnel will review medical history, and medications. Height, weight, pulse, and blood 
pressure will be obtained.  A study investigator will perform a physical examination, excluding 
breast and pelvic exams. Females of child -bearing potential will tak e a urine pregnancy test, 
which must be negative to participate.  A venous blood sample will be taken for the following 
tests: hemoglobin A1C, complete blood count, complete metabolic set (including creatinine, liver 
set, and electrolytes.  If subjects have had any of the aforementioned labs performed within the [ADDRESS_983675]. An EKG will be completed. A study investigator will assess 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and review the subject’s medical record for clarification as needed.   
A three -digit subject ID number will be assigned to the subject.   
 
Subjects will undergo VO 2max testing at the end of the screening visit if all inclusion criteria are 
met and no exclusion criteria are met, with the exception of blood test results which will not be 
immediately available. A study investigator will be present for the entire VO 2max testing 
procedure. Additional CBG samples will be taken immedia tely before and after completion of 
the VO 2max test. Subjects will be given juice and the VO 2max test will either be delayed by 
[CONTACT_3450] 1 hour for CBG values of <80 mg/dL, or rescheduled for a different day.  Subjects 
will be given 15 -20 grams of car bohydrates for CBG values of <70 mg/dL at any point during 
the screening visit. CBG values will be reviewed by [CONTACT_588763] a snack after VO 2max testing as needed to avoid post -testing hypoglycemia. Subjects that 
scree n fail by [CONTACT_588764] 2max test will not 
complete the VO 2max test. The VO 2max test can be completed at a separate visit after the initial 
screening visit but before the Dexcom G6 sensor insertion if ne eded to accommodate the 
subject’s schedule.  This visit will take approximately 2.5 hours.  
 
Dexcom G6 Sensor Insertion Visits:  
Dexcom G6 sensor insertion visits will be on Days 1 and 14. After arrival at the OHSU OCTRI 
outpatient clinic , the Biomedical Engineering Point of Care (BME POC) Laboratory  or Harold 
Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center clinic, women of childbearing potential will receive a urine 
pregnancy test if the last pregnancy test performed was more than [ADDRESS_983676] two glucose sensor s inserted at this visit, a commercial G5 or G6 glucose 
sensor and an investigational G6 with temperature logger sensor. Subjects will receive training 
on how to insert  the commercial Dexcom G5  or G6  system  according to the manufacturer’s 
directions . Subje cts will be instructed how to connect the transmitter to the Dexcom app on an 
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v 17   Date: April 18 , 2019

 iPhone that will be returned at the end of the study. Subjects will be instructed how to calibrate 
and change out the sensor according to the manufacturer’s directions. If subjec ts are given a 
Dexcom G5, they will be asked to calibrate the sensor every [ADDRESS_983677] the 
commercial sensors if they fail or become dislodged. Trained study personnel or a Dexcom 
representative will insert the G6 with temperature logger after appropriate preparation of the 
abdominal skin as per the m anufacturer’s directions. An adhesive overlay may be placed over G5 
and/or G6 sensors to prevent dislodgement. The subjects will not be able to view the Dexcom G6  
with temperature logger sensor  values. The wire glucose sensors are sterile and will be used for 
single use only as directed by [CONTACT_3455].    
 
The G5 /G6 CGM alerts will be set at 70 mg/dL and 300 mg/dL. Subjects will be given a Contour 
Next meter for measuring their capi[INVESTIGATOR_720430]. Subjec ts will be instructed to check a CBG for symptoms of hypoglycemia and for CGM 
alarms indicating sensed glucose is less than 70 mg/dL. Subjects will be instructed to discontinue 
the use of acetaminophen for all periods when wearing the Dexcom G5 sensor. Subjects will be 
asked to collect the time, date and location of all G6 sensor insertions while at home.  
 
For the first sensor insertion visit on Day 1, subjects will be given a FitBit  or Apple Watch  to 
wear. Subjects will also be provided with Novolog cartr idges for use in the Inpen and Lantus 
Solostar or Tresiba insulin pens for Days [ADDRESS_983678] was using Humalog or Api[INVESTIGATOR_720431], the insulin doses will generally be kept the same given these short -acting insulin 
formulations are equivalent to Novolog. The investigator will review the patient’s current long 
acting insulin and their medical history to determine if the subject should use Tresiba or Lantus 
during the study. Subjects will use GoCaps or Clipsulin to track their long acting  insulin dose. If 
subjects are switching  their long-acting insulin, the investigator will review the insulin dose with 
the subject and determine an appropriate dose of Lantus  or Tresiba .  
 
Subjects will be instructed on the use of these devices along with the mobile app T1 DEXI. 
Meals and exercise can be scheduled for specific times each week within the app. The app will 
alert the user with pre - and post meal reminders on the day of and the day after exercise. Subjects 
will be instructed to take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_720432] T1 DEXI app every day for the [ADDRESS_983679] study staff for any issues with the de vices. This instruction on Day 1 should take an 
additional 30 minutes.  
 
For the second sensor insertion visit on Day 14, study staff can insert the new G6 with 
temperature logger sensor before staff remove s the previous G6 sensor  to facilitate a quicker 
discharge . The sensor site will be inspected for signs of irritation or infection. In addition, the

We plan to install the OHSU AirWatch Agent / Container on the iPhones.   Upon enrollment, 
subjects will be assigned with a three -digit code that will be used instead of their name, medical 
record number or other personally identifying informat ion. The key associating the code and the 
subjects personnal identifying information will be restricted to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6012]. The key 
will be encrypted and kept secure on a restricted OHSU network drive in a limited access folder. 
The iPhones will be registered to the study partic ipants’ unique study ID number and all of the 
data stored on the iPhone will be associated with this ID .   
Two In -Clinic Exercise Visits:  
The in -clinic exercise visits will be conducted in the Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center, 
the Biomedical Engineering Point of Care (BME POC) Laboratory  or the OCTRI outpatient 
research unit. After arrival at the clinic, women of childbearing potential will receive a urine 
pregnancy test if the last pregn ancy test performed was more than [ADDRESS_983681] be 
negative before further participation is allowed. A code cart is on site at all locations and a code 
team is available by [CONTACT_412601]. The exercise visits will be on Days 9 (window of  days 9 -
14) and 16 (window of days 16 -20). The subject will be asked to check his/her CBG before 
driving to the clinic and to bring a snack in the car in case hypoglycemia does occur (in which 
case, the subject must park and treat the hypoglycemia).   
 
Subjects will be randomized to either aerobic, anaerobic or high intensity interval exercise 
sessions. Exercise sessions will be approximately [ADDRESS_983682] of exercises to b e performed is provided in 
Appendix E. Subjects will be given a Polar heart rate strap to wear during the in -clinic exercise. 
A capi[INVESTIGATOR_30135] (CBG) will be obtained and measured by [CONTACT_720440].  For subject  safety, CBG must be 80 mg/dl or higher to begin 
exercise. Subjects will be given 15 grams of carbohydate (such as 4 oz of juice) for values <120 
mg/dL at the start of exercise or for values of <70 mg/dL at any point after the start of exercise. 
For subjec ts who require carbohydrate treatment  for values < 70 mg/dl , a CBG will be repeated 
in 15 minutes and exercise will be resumed once CBG is 70 mg/dL or higher. A study 
investigator will be contact[CONTACT_720441] >250 mg/dL to determine if the subject requires a d ose of 
short -acting insulin  and serum ketones will be checked  by [CONTACT_720442] . 
The exercise visit will be cancelled  if ketones are greater than 0.6 mmol/L . The subject will be 
discharged with a bottle of water along with instructi ons from the investigator for checking 
glucose at home . Subjects will be taken to the emergency room for ketone levels > 3.0 mmol/L. 
The PEAK recommendations, guidelines from a collaboration of researchers through the 
Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) for exercising with Type 1 diabetes, specify that 
it is safe to exercise if ketones are below this threshold [1]. Oral temperature will be taken with a 
thermometer just before and at the end of exercise and recorded. During exercise visits, for 
comp arison with the CGM readings, CBG will be checked before exercise, every 10 minutes 
during exercise, at the end of exercise and every 15 minutes for an additional 30 minutes at the 
end of exercise.  
 
During the exercise period, there will be defined rules for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_99492], including:  
1) If the subject feels unwell,  
IRB [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v 17   Date: April 18 , 2019  
   
11 | P a g e  
 2) If the subject develops hypoglycemic symptoms, such as excessive sweating, 
shaking/tremors, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], feelings of dread or panic, light -headedness, nausea, 
difficulty concentrating or the l ike, 
3) If the subject develops chest pain/pressure,  
4) If the subject develops undue shortness of breath (SOB),  
5) Signs of poor perfusion: light -headedness, confusion, ataxia, pallor, cyanosis, nausea, or 
cold and clammy skin  
6) For patient preference.  
 
At-home Study Exercise Sessions:  
Subjects will be asked to complete four at -home exercise sessions consistent with the assigned 
type of exercise, on Days 2 or 3, Days 4 or 5, Days 23 or 24 and Days 25 or 26.  Instructions for 
the exercise will be provided via vide o links and will be the same set as instructions for the in -
clinic visits (see Appendix E). Subjects will be instructed to check a CBG before initiating 
exercise to ensure safety. Subjects will be instructed to consume a snack if glucose is <120

will be instructed to use the InPen app to calculate if a correction dose is needed and delay 
exercise until glucose is <250 mg/dL. Subjects will enter information about ex ercise into the T1 
DEXI app. Subjects will receive reminders via phone or text to complete their exercise and to 
monitor adherence to protocol. Participants may also receive reminders to enter activity 
information through the T1DEXI app. Subjects will also  be instructed to check a CBG after 
exercise and consume a snack if needed.  
 
 
Study Investigator review of CGM data:  
The study investigator will review the subject’s insulin and CGM data online approximately 
every 7 days (Days 7, 14, and 21) and  make insu lin dose recommendations by [CONTACT_648]. Subjects 
will confirm the settings were changed appropriately by [CONTACT_41680] a screen shot of the change and 
sending the pi[INVESTIGATOR_520735] a study phone. The study investigator will make a note of why any changes 
were made.   
 
Day 28  Study Completion visit:  
At this visit, the insulin pens and other devices will be turned in for download. The subject’s 
weight will be collected at this visit. The study investigator will consult with the subject 
regarding appropriate insulin dosing for t he remainder of the day. The FitBit  or Apple Watch  and 
Dexcom sensor(s) will be removed from the subject. The sensor site will be inspected for signs 
of irritation or infection. In addition, the sensor will be inspected for the possibility of breakage 
or fracture. If there is any evidence of sensor breakage, it will be recorded. If an area of 
inflammation of [ADDRESS_983683]. Subjects 
will be given oral carbohydrate for values below 85 mg/dl, and will be instructed to give an 
injection of aspart insulin if deemed a ppropriate by [CONTACT_54851] 150 
mg/dl.

 If a study visit is stopped prematurely the subject will be asked if they can repeat the study visit 
that was terminated early with additional compensation provided. Repeating the study visit will 
be optional.  
 
Cleaning and Disinfecting  
All devices will be cleaned and disinfected between subjects. The smart phone, Dexcom G5 and 
G6 transmitters and FitBit  or Apple Watch  will be cleaned by [CONTACT_464].   Technicians who are 
disinfecting un its will wash hands thoroughly and wear gloves. All items will undergo 
intermediate -level disinfection using SANI -CLOTH AF3 Germicidal disposable wipes.  The 
disinfectant will be applied and allowed to air dry . After disinfection, when the units are 
comple tely dry, they will be placed in a sealed bag labeled with  subject information.  
 
Statistical methods   
Data will be analyzed using generalized estimating equations, which takes into account 
correlated data and repeated measures.  Data will be analyzed usin g an intention -to-treat analysis 
and missing sensed glucose values will be interpolated for up to 20 min segments.   
    
Confidentiality and Protection of Human Subjects  
RISKS and BENEFITS  
Risks:  The risks of the protocol procedures are considered minor. Subjects will be managing 
their own blood glucose as they normally would with recommendations for insulin dosing from 
the study investigator. A study investigator will be on campus during all exer cise visits.  
 
Risks from exercise include falls, sprains, bruises, very low risk of bone fractures and head 
trauma. The likelihood of significant harm is quite low.  
Rarely, there can be allergic responses to insulin such as skin redness, hives, itching o f the skin, 
swelling of the mouth, or breathing difficulties. The se reactions are considered very unlikely.  
 
There is a small risk of sensor fracture, and in such a case, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_54811]. For this reas on, the study investigator will inspect each removed 
sensor for the possibility of breakage or fracture. Any evidence of sensor breakage will be 
recorded and reported to FDA and the sensor company . 
 
Benefits:  The subject may not directly benefit from being in this study; however, their 
participation may help to advance automated insulin decision support software.  
 
COSTS :   
Subjects will receive $ 700 for completion of all study visits.  If subjects withdraw early from the 
study, compensation will be given as follows: $[ADDRESS_983684] will also receive $1 75 for the partial week.  There is no 
compensation for the screening visit. If a subjec t is asked to repeat an in -clinic exercise study 
visit due to technical problems, he/she will receive an additional $75.

 Monitoring Procedures:  
This protocol is written in accordance wit h the principles established by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical 
Assembly General Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and amendments and clarifications adopted by [CONTACT_941] 
29th (Tokyo, 1975), 35th (Venice, 1983), 41st (Hong Kong, 1989), 48th (Somerset West, South 
Africa, 1996), 52 nd (Edinburgh, 2000), 53rd (Washington, 2002), 55th (Tokyo, 2004), 59th 
(Seoul, 2008), and 64th (Brazil, 2013) General Assemblies. The investigator will ensure that the 
study described in this protocol is conducted in full conformance with those principles , the 
protocol, current FDA regulations, ICH Good Clinical Practices (GCP) guidelines, Good 
Laboratory Practices (GLP) guidelines, local ethical and regulatory requirements, including the 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, U.S. applicable Code of Federal  Regulations (title 21), 
any IEC requirements relative to clinical studies.  
Should a conflict arise, the investigator will follow whichever law or guideline affords the 
greater protection to the individual subject. The investigator will also ensure thorou gh familiarity 
with the appropriate use and potential risks of use of the study device, as described in this 
protocol, prior to the initiation of the study.  
Unanticipated problems will be detected by [CONTACT_720444] e vents and risks in the IRB -approved research protocol and the current IRB approved 
consent form, any underlying disease or conditions of the subject experiencing the adverse event, 
a careful assessment of whether the adverse event is related or possibly re lated to the subject’s 
participation in the study.  
 
Triggers for reporting unanticipated problems are seizure, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death or any other 
occurrence considered serious by [CONTACT_978]. If ongoing monitoring of the closed -loop studies reveals 
studies rep eatedly being terminated because of unresponsive hyperglycemia or repeated serious 
hypoglycemia (resulting in altered mental status, loss of consciousness, or seizure) believed not 
amenable to revisions in control system parameter tuning, then the study wi ll be discontinued 
immediately. If studies in two subjects are stopped for severe hypoglycemia or severe 
hyperglycemia, then the entire study will be halted. In addition, if there is any unexpected event 
such as death or patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the studie s will be stopped until the root cause is 
evaluated.  
 
Any adverse event (AE) and/or unanticipated problem (UP) will be reported to the investigator 
monitor immediately by [CONTACT_54858]. Hypo - and hyperglycemia will not be 
considered AEs unless subject has positive ketones or displays symptoms of hypoglycemia such 
as: loss of consciousness, slurred speech, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54812].  One of the 
investigators will always be on -call during the closed -loop studies and will write up a description 
of the adverse event/unanticipated problem. All reportable new information (RNI) will be 
reported to the IRB within five calendar days after the PI [INVESTIGATOR_54813]. RNI is any 
information t hat might meet the regulatory definition of an unanticipated problem involving risks 
to subjects or others or serious or continuing noncompliance that might impact the criteria for 
IRB approval. The report will be submitted to the IRB by [CONTACT_720445]. A summary of all UP's and adverse events, including those that do not meet the 
requirement for RNI, will be submitted with the continuing review.

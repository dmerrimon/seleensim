SUMMARY:  
 
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common  endocrine disorder among reproductive 
age women with a prevalence as high as 15% . The clinical symptoms of PCOS including 
menstrual dysfunction, inferti lity, hirsu tism, alopecia, acn e, and the possible increased risk of 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease have been reported to be significant contributors to 
psychological morbidity and impact health -related quality of life . For women wi th PCOS, the 
changes in physical appearance and th e associated mood disorders appear to be deleterious for 
sexual function.  
Vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml serum concentration of 25[OH]D), which affects from 67% to 
85% of women,[ADDRESS_572458] evaluated the outcomes of treatment for PC OS upon sexual and 
subjective health status of women.  
The goal s of this study are:   
1. To evaluate the prevalence of sexual dysfunction (SDy) in women with Polycys tic Ovarian 
Syndrome (PCOS)  
 
 
Version 3, 08-20-2020   2 
 2. To determin e the effects of Vitamin D therapy, with and witho ut hormonal contraceptives, on 
SDy in women with PCOS in the absence of depression.  
 
METHODS : 
 
The study will enroll 60 women diagnosed with PCOS and reporting SDy at the Wright State 
Physicians  (WSP)  OB-GYN Practice  and the WSP Family Medicine Practice .  
All p articipants will tak e vitamin D 600IU/day and will choose between hormonal and non -
hormona l contraceptive methods  (target of 30 participants in each group) . Participants will 
complete three study visits (Initial, Month 3, and Month 6). Vitamin D leve ls will be drawn at 
the beginning of the study and again at 3 and 6 months after initiation of v itamin D therapy. Each 
participant will be asked to complete the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI) prior to initiation  of treatment and again at 6 months.

BACKGROUND : 
 
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common  endocrine disorder among reproductive 
age women with a prevalence as high as 15% using  Rotterdam diagnostic criteria.[ADDRESS_572459] health -related qual ity of life 
(HRQoL)4,5 including depression and anxiety,6,7 suicide attempts,8 body dissatisfaction,9 eating 
disorders,10 lower overall health -related quality of life11 and diminished sexual satisfaction.12,13 
 
For women with PCOS, the changes in physical appearance and the associated mood disorders 
appear to be deleterious for sexual function.6 Previous research in this area is scant, and what has 
been done reveals a large number of women with PCOS (60%) reporti ng sexual dysfunction and 
that the domains of  desire and arousal are most commonly affected (in 98% - 99% of cases). 
Using the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ), others have reported that 
women with PCOS were similar to control women in th e number of sexual thoughts and 
fantasies and  in the frequency of sexual intercourse, but differed significantly with lower 
orgasm/completion scores than control women.[ADDRESS_572460] of depression and psychotropic medications on 
sexual dysfunction.  
 
Vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml serum concentra tion of 25[OH]D), which affects from 67% to 
85% of women,[ADDRESS_572461] shown that 
lower 25[OH]D levels are associated with insulin resistance, ovulatory and menstrual 
irregularities, lower pregnancy suc cess, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, obesity, and elevated 
cardiovascular disease risk factors14 as well as decreased HRQoL and depression in select 
 
Version 3, 08-20-[ADDRESS_572462] 
been proposed to explain the association between vitamin D and depression.  
 
The role of calcitriol or 1,25 dihydroxy cholecalciferol, the bioactive form of vitamin D, in brain 
tissue has been confir med by [CONTACT_449296] D receptors (VDRs) and hydroxylases in 
various brain regions. One area where VDRs and hydroxylases have been found in the amygdala, 
the center of the limbic system, where behavior and emotions are regulated.[ADDRESS_572463] of treatment using oral contraceptives with Vitamin D on SDy in absence of depression. 
We anticipate this may provide a new treatment strategy in SDy issues for women with PCOS.  
 
 
OBJECTIVES:  
 
1. To evaluate the prevalence of sexual dysfunction ( SDy) in women with Polycys tic Ovarian 
Syndrome (PCOS)  
 
2. To determine the effects of Vitamin D therapy, with and without hormonal contraceptives, on 
SDy in women with PCOS in the absence of depression.  
 
 
METHODS : 
 
The study will enroll 60 women diagnosed  with PCOS and reporting SDy at the Wright State 
Physicians  (WSP)  OB-GYN Practice  and the WSP Family Medicine Practice .  
 
All p articipants will tak e vitamin D 600IU/day (as recommended by [CONTACT_5052]'s Office of Dietary Supplements) a nd will choose between hormonal and non -hormonal 
contraceptiv e methods  (target of 30 participants in each group) . Participants will complete three 
study visits (Initial, Month 3, and Month 6). Vitamin D levels will be drawn at the beginning of 
the study an d again at 3 and 6 months after initiation of vitamin D thera py. Each participant will 
be asked to complete the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI) prior to initiation of treatment and again at 6 months.

4) Have any contraindications to hormona l contraception  
 
Recruitment:   
Participants will be recruited from the Wright State Physicians Obstetrics and Gynecology and 
Family Medicine practice offices. The opportunity to be involved in this research project will be 
approached at their clinic visit with the physician if the  patient meets selection criteria. A consent 
form will be given and the study will be discussed.  
 
In addition,  print advertisements will be placed in the local Reach magazine  to recr uit patients in 
the Dayton area .  
 
Stipends : 
Participants  will receive a stipend  in the form of a MasterC ard gift card  for their time and travel . 
After each completed study visit the participant will be provided with a gift card -in the amounts  
as follows:  $50 at Visit 1 and Visit 3, and $35 at Vis it 2 for a maximum  per patient compensation 
of $1 35. 
 
HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION:  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_449294]. This protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_449298]. Only subjects who meet study eligibility criteria will be 
enrolled. All eligible participants will have the study explained to the m. The informed consent 
process will be conducted appropriately and the informed consent will be obtained prior to 
proceeding with any study procedures.  
 
The primary physician or the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_449295] o btaining informed consent from patients. They will be uniform in their explanations 
of the nature of the study to all patients who fit the selection criteria. Those patients interested in 
 
Version 3, 08-20-2020   7 
 participating will be given time to read over the informed consent. The patients will be asked 
either in the clinic to be involved in the study. After the informed consent is reviewed by [CONTACT_449299].   
 
Adverse events will be reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_16817].  In the event that 
any additional diagnoses are obtained during this study, the primary physician for the patient will 
be notified. It  will be their responsibility to notify the patient of these diagnoses and any changes 
to management that may result.    
 
Subjects’ confidentiality will be protected.  Participants will be assigned a unique identification 
(ID) number for the study that will  be used on data collection forms rather than subjects’ names.  
Only the minimum data necessary to conduct the study and meet  the objectives will be collected. 
Data will be stored in a secure database (REDCap19) that uses a unique username [CONTACT_449300].  Data will be de -identified prior to  analysis .      
 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY IN RELATION TO HUMAN HEALTH  (BENEFITS) : 
  
PCOS is the most common reproductive endocrine disorder that has a number of health quality 
of life issues.  The ben efit of this study will be to identify SDy which is often overlooked and 
may potentially  be helped with Vit D and/or birth control.  
 
POTENTIAL HAZARDS (RISKS) : 
 
The study questionnaires may evoke stressful feelings taking a psychosocial questionnaire.  In 
addition, there are rare potential risks related to OCPs including deep venous thrombosis, and 
stroke. 
 
Serious side effects of vitamin D  include allergic reactions, swelling of the face, throat, and 
tongue, dizziness, irregular or racing heart beat, dry m outh, headache, vomiting, weakness and 
lack of energy, and fatigue  
 
The risks of taking blood incl ude pain, a bruise at the point where the blood is taken, redness and 
swelling of the vein and infection, and a rare risk of fainting.  
 
ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TI ME TO COMPLETE STUDY : 
  
We estimate data collection, data analysis, and abstract writing to requir e approximately 18 -24 
months.  Preparation of the manuscript will require an additional 6 -9 months.

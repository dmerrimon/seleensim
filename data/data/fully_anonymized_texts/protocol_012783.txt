Official Title:  A Comparison of Two Forms of Intensive Voice Treatment for Parkinson's Disease   
 
NCT : NCT0370068 4 
 
Document Date: April 10, 2023  
 
 
  
Background  
 
Motor impairment is a hallmark feature of P arkinson ’s disease (P D). The motor -based symptoms are 
characterized by [CONTACT_447738] a nd coordinating 
movement . An important functional consequence of these motor -based impairments  is a marked reduction 
in speaking intensity. This condition, known as hypophonia, is estimated to effect approximately 75% of 
patients in some stage of th e disease process . 
 
Our two  current, evidence -based treatments for hypophonia, LSVT LOUD® and the SpeechViveTM, use 
high effort speech tasks to increase motor output across the speech mechanism. While LSVT LOUD® 
and the SpeechViveTM share the same therapeutic target (increased speec h intensity), they differ 
substantially in the type of cueing used in therapy. LSVT LOUD® targets louder speech using internal, 
self-initiated cues. The SpeechViveTM, in contrast, elicits louder speech using a naturalistic, external 
noise cue. While data show that LSVT LOUD® and the SpeechViveTM both yield significant 
improvements in sound pressure level (SPL)/vocal inte nsity , the supportive physiologic adjustments used 
by [CONTACT_447739]. Our long -term goal is to improve voice rehabilitation for persons 
with PD. Our objectives are to determine the influence of treatment on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_447725], and to identify the 
perceptions of physical and mental effort associated with each form of therapy. Our central hypothesis is 
that treatment strategy will differentially impact the physiologic systems that support louder speech and 
mediate speaker perceptions of effort. We plan to objectively test our central hypothesis and, thereby, 
attain the objective of this application by [CONTACT_319880]:  
 
Aim 1 : To examine physiologic adjustments in respi[INVESTIGATOR_447726] (LSVT LOUD®) and external cueing (SpeechV iveTM) strategies. Based on 
published research and preliminary data, we hypothesize that the external cueing treatment will elicit 
more efficient respi[INVESTIGATOR_447727], in comparison to the internal 
cueing treatment.  
 
Aim 2: To assess participants’ level of perceived physical and mental effort associated with LSVT 
LOUD® and SpeechViveTM therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. We hypothesize that speakers with PD will assign lower ratings 
of perceived physical and mental effort for SpeechViveTM therapy,  in comparison to LSVT LOUD®. 
This hypothesis is predicated on programmatic differences in training intensity level and cognitive load.  
 
Methods  
 
Participants : Thirty -six individuals with a neurological diagnosis of idiopathic PD will be enrolled for 
study in West Lafayette, Indiana (and surrounding areas) and in Amherst, [LOCATION_005] (and 
surrou nding areas). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: LSVT LOUD® (n=12), 
SpeechViveTM (n=12), non -treatment PD control (n=12). Participants assigned to the non -treatment 
control group will be sampled at the same time points as the experimental groups. The sample size has 
been chosen to detect a [ADDRESS_569342] difference with a study power of 0.8 and significance level of 0.05. 
Inclusionary criteria include: (i) problems with speech volume as determined by [CONTACT_447740] -certified 
speech -language  pathologist, (ii) unaided hearing in at least one ear (to accommodate the 
SpeechViveTM), (iii) non -smoking in the past 5 years, (iv) no recent history of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375]; (v) no 
neurological conditions other than PD and no history of neurosurgeries, ( vi) free of depressive symptoms 
(Beck Depression Inventory score < 19) , (vii) no voice therapy or voice therapy maintenance within the 
last six months, ( viii) negative laryngeal pat hology as determined by a videolaryngoscopic examination. 
Participants who present with normal vocal fold closure or incomplete vocal fold closure will be included 
for study. Patients with vocal fold lesions, hyperadduction, or other laryngeal pathology wi ll be excluded 
and referred for treatment.  
 
Methods and Analysi s: LSVT LOUD® and SpeechViveTM follow a standardized treatment protocol 
which will ensure treatment fidelity across sites.  The research personnel responsi ble for administering 
treatment will be LSVT LOUD® -certified and trained in the SpeechViveTM protocol. Data will be 
collected at three time points for each group: pre -treatment, m id-treatment, and immediately post -
treatment. In accordance with specific aim 1, outcomes measures will include sound pressure level (SPL), 
utterance length, respi[INVESTIGATOR_447728], and laryngeal aerodynamic patterns. Pre -to-post 
treatment changes in SPL will serve as a primary indi cator on the effectiveness of each intervention 
technique. SPL and utterance length will be captured and analyzed during a two-minute  monologue task . 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_447729] . 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_447730] a monologue  and reading  task.  Laryngeal aerodynamic 
data will be captured during a sentence -level task (‘‘Buy pop or pop a papa”) using a circumferentially -
vented pneumotachograph mask. In accordance with specif ic aim 2, a  modified version of the National 
Aeronautics and Space A dministration Task Load Index (NASA -TLX) [46] will be used to examine the 
participants’ perceived level of physical and mental effort associated with LSVT LOUD® and 
SpeechViveTM therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Following each treatment session, participants will be instructed to compl ete 
the computerized NASA -TLX scale and assign a visual analogue rating for the Mental Demand (how 
much mental and perceptual activity was required) and Physical Demand (how much physical activity 
was required) domains. Higher scores reflect speakers’ perc eptions of increased effort.  
 
For specific aim 1, t he sta tistical approach will involve a repeated measures analysis of variance for each 
outcome variable : SPL, utterance length, respi[INVESTIGATOR_447731] , and laryngeal aerodynamic 
measures.  The within -subject factor will be Session (pre, mid, post) and the between -subject factor will be 
Group (LSVT LOUD®, SpeechViveTM, and non-treatment  control). Participa nt will be included as a 
random effect in the model to account for expected inter -subject differences in response to treatment. If 
the measures exhibit strong skewness or outlying values, we will compare the groups using appropriate 
non-parametric methods.  Bonferroni -adjusted p -values will be used to reduce Type I error. For specific 
aim 2, each domain score  of the NASA -TLX  will be statistically analyzed using a separate, repeated 
measures analysis of variance. Treatment session will be included as a factor in each analysis. The model 
will include random effects to account for wi thin-subject correlation. If the measures exhibit strong 
skewness or outlying values, we will compare the groups using non -parametric methods. Bonferroni -
adjusted p -values will be used to reduce Type I error.

Page 2 of 5  control group, you are not eligible for voice treatment. Si nce this is a treatment study, we will ask you to not 
engage in other form of therapy (surgical, pharmacological , or behavioral) for the duration of the study. As a 
research participant, you are ask to attend [ADDRESS_569344] be asked to i) complete a depression inventory 
to assess your mood, ii) pass a cognitive screening inventory,  and iii) participate in a laryngeal examination. 
As part of the cognitive screening, you will be asked a series of questions related to orientation of place and 
time, remember a sequence of words for a short period of time (e.g. a few minutes), name [CONTACT_272755], and follow 
a series of short commands. The laryngeal examination w ill be conducted by a trained member of the research 
team. For this examination, you will be seated and a Velcro strap will hold a mi crophone comfortably on the 
side of your neck. You will be asked to stick out your tongue, which will be held by [CONTACT_447742]. An endoscope will then be slowly inserted towa rds the back of your mouth so that a video recording 
of your larynx (voice box) can be made . The endoscope is a straight blunt metal rod (about the diameter of a 
“pi[INVESTIGATOR_186394]”) with a tiny camera lens at the end. Ne ither the endoscope nor the Velcro strap will interfere 
with your breathing. You will say an “ee” sound and then  the endoscope will be rem oved. The endoscope will 
be disinfected after each use.  
 
Based on the results of these tests, you may be deemed ineligible to participate. In such instances, you will be 
compensated for the time you participated at a prorated rate of $10 per hour. 
 
If you are deemed eligible to participate, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire that focuses on your 
medical history which includes questions about your Parkinson’s disease, general health, medications, and 
any speech and voice problems you may be experien cing. You may skip any question that you feel 
uncomfortable answering. We will also ask you to re lease a test score from your neurologist to us which 
indexes the severity of your Parkinson’s disease. You do not need to agree to this rele ase to participate in the 
study. In addition, you will undergo a brief heading screening which requires you to listen for tones and 
raise your hand when you hear the tone. 
 
In addition, you will be asked to wear a microphone a nd perform a variety of speaking tasks including, but 
not limited to reading sentences, short passages, and/ or citing a monologue. You will also be asked to 
perform different breathing exercises while wearing nose clips including breathing in and out as much as 
you can into a cardboard mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. The nose clips and mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_447733]. You will also be fitted with elasticized bands that  are worn on the outside your clothing around your rib 
cage and abdomen. The bands do not impede your ability to breathe. We will ask you to breathe quietly, to 
breathe in and out as much air as you can, and to move your abdomen in and out. You will also be asked to talk about a topic of interest for several minutes. Lastly, we will place a mask over your mouth and nose. The mask will measure the air as it comes out of your mouth. A small tube will be placed between your lips and behind your teeth. It will not impede your ability to talk. We will ask you to read a sentence several 
times with the mask in place. The mask and tube will be disinfected after each use. You may take breaks as 
needed or cease participation at any time. You have just completed your pre-treatment lab session. You will be asked to perform these tasks again in week 4 (mid-treatment) and week 8 (end of treatment). 
 
This is a research study that involves questions re lated to sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_447734]. As 
researchers, we do not provide mental health services and we will not be following up with you after this 
study. However, we want to provide every participant in this study with contact [CONTACT_447743], should you decide you need assistance at any time. In a serious emergency, remember that you can also call [ADDRESS_569345]/Purdue University.

6. WHAT ARE MY BENEFITS OF BEING IN THIS STUDY? 
Your participation in the study will advance our knowledge of what treatment approaches may help 
alleviate the speech and voice problems commonly reported by [CONTACT_8335] w ith Parkinson's disease. 
 
7. WHAT ARE MY RISKS OF BEING IN THIS STUDY ? 
We believe there are minimal physical risks associated  with this research study. A possible risk to you 
however, might include fatigue. To lower the risk of fatigue, you will have periods of rest throughout each 
laboratory session. You may also request a break at anytime. There is also a risk of a breach of 
confidentiality. To minimize this risk, you will be assigned a unique identifier which will be assigned to 
your records and collected voice samples. Your consen t form, which contains identifying information, 
will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in a secu red room, only accessible to key research personnel for a 
period of three years. After three years, all st udy records will be destroyed. Should a breach of 
confidentiality occur you will be immediately informed  of the breach verbally and in writing. There is 
also a minimal risk of infection. To minimize this risk, all instruments used during data collection are 
sterilized with medical grade disinfectant prior to  use. The nose clips and mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_447735]. The mask and tube will be disinfected after each use. During the examination of the larynx, 
some people find that they gag temporarily if the endoscope touches the back of their tongue or throat. 
The sensation is similar to what you may have e xperienced while brushing your tongue with a tooth 
brush. In addition, there may be a remote chance of damage to teeth and dental work. A trained member 
of the research team will guide the endoscope usi ng techniques designed to minimize this risk. The 
endoscope will be disinfected after each use.  
 
As a participant in this study, you will be asked to provide sensitive information about your physical and 
mental well-being and demographic da ta (age, gender, height, weight, race/ethnicity). You may refuse to 
answer any question without repercussion. There is a low psychological risk that you may be upset by 
[CONTACT_447744]-related issues.  We can provide you with a list of mental health 
professionals in your community, if th is information would be helpful. 
 
8. HOW WILL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION BE PROTECTED? 
The following procedures will be used to protect the confidentiality of your study records. The researchers 
will keep all study records in a locked file cabinet in a secure room  accessible only to project staff. 
Electronic data files will be stored on a password protected computer in a secure room accessible only to project staff. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_447736] a HIPAA and HITECH compliant data 
sharing platform. All records will be labeled with a unique code. A master key which links participant 
names with their unique codes will be maintained  in a separate and secure location accessible to key 
research personnel. The master key and data files will be  destroyed 3 years after the close of the study. At 
the conclusion of this study, the researchers may pub lish their findings. Information will be presented in 
summary format and you will not be identified in any publications or presentations. 
 
9. WILL I RECEIVE ANY PAYMENT FOR TAKING PART IN THE STUDY? 
You will be compensated $10/hour for e ach laboratory session you participate in.

Treatment Overview: You could have been placed into one of three groups: LSVT LOUD® treatment, 
SpeechViveTM treatment, or non-treatment control group. You have been placed in the LSVT LOUD® 
treatment group . As a part of the study, you will be asked to  participate in [ADDRESS_569350] the da y and time of your vocal practice. In the home 
maintenance program, you will be asked to practice the vocal exercises 4 days per week for 4 weeks. A 
homework DVD will be provided which provides an overvie w of the vocal exercises to be completed. The 
LSVT LOUD® treatment will be provided by [CONTACT_447748]-certified practitioner. Since this is a treatment study, we will ask you to not engage in other form of therapy (surgical, pharmacological, or behavioral) 
for the duration of the study.

Number of Days of LSVT Maintenance: 5 days per week  
Number of Weeks for LSVT Maintenance: 4 weeks  
  
Data Collection:  In the first visit to the lab, you will be asked to complete several screening tasks in order to 
be certain that you are appropriate to participate in th is study. The first part of the screening was completed 
with the questions you answered over the phone. To confir m eligibility, you will first be asked to i) complete 
a depression inventory to assess your mood, ii) pass a cogn itive screening inventory, and iii) participate in a 
laryngeal examination. As part of the cognitive screeni ng, you will be asked a series of questions related to

In addition, your participation in the study will advance our knowledge of what treatment approaches may 
help alleviate the speech and voice problems commonly reported by [CONTACT_447752]'s disease.  
  
7. WHAT ARE MY RISKS OF BEING IN THIS STUDY ?   
We believe there are minimal physical risks associated  with this research study.  A possible risk to you 
however, might include fatigue. To lower the risk of fa tigue, you will have periods of rest throughout each 
laboratory session. You may also request a break at anytime. There is also a risk of a breach of 
confidentiality. To minimize this risk, you will be assigned a unique identifier which will be assigned to 
your records and collected voice samples. Your consen t form, which contains identifying information, 
will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in a secu red room, only accessible to key research personnel for a 
period of three years. After three years, all st udy records will be destroyed. Should a breach of 
confidentiality occur you will be immediately inform ed of the breach verbally and in writing.   
  
During the examination of the larynx, some people find that they gag temporarily if the endoscope touches 
the back of their tongue or throat. The sensation is  similar to what you may have experienced while 
brushing your tongue with a tooth brush. In addition, there may be a remote chance of damage to teeth 
and dental work. A trained member of the research team will guide the endoscope using techniques 
designed to minimize this risk. The endoscope will be disinfected after each use. The audiometer headphones will be disinfected before and after you use them in order to minimize the slight risk that you 
will come into contact [CONTACT_447753] b acteria. The nose clips and mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_447735]. The mask and tube will be disinfected after each use.

 speaking the noise will turn off so it does not interfere with your ability to listen during a conversation. 
Since this is a treatment study, we will ask you to not engage in other form of therapy (surgical, 
pharmacological, or behavioral) for the duration of the study.  
 
Number of Days to Wear Device : 5 days per week 
Number of hours to Wear Daily : 2-4 hours/day 
Number of Weeks to Wear Device : [ADDRESS_569359] be asked to i) complete a 
depression inventory to assess your mood, ii) pass a cognitive screening inventory, and iii) participate in a 
laryngeal examination. As part of the cognitive screening, you will be asked a series of questions related to 
orientation of place and time, remember a sequence of words for a short period of time (e.g. a few minutes), 
name [CONTACT_272755], and follow a series of short commands. The laryngeal examination will be conducted by a 
trained member of the research team. For this examination, you will be seated and a Velcro strap will hold a 
microphone comfortably on the side of your neck. You will be asked to stick out your tongue, which will be 
held by [CONTACT_447757]. An endoscope will then be slowly inserted towards the back of 
your mouth so that a video recording of your larynx (voice box) can be made. The endoscope is a straight 
blunt metal rod (about the diameter of a “pi[INVESTIGATOR_186394]”) with a tiny camera lens at the end. Neither the 
endoscope nor the Velcro strap will interfere with your breathing. You will say an “ee” sound and then the 
endoscope will be removed. The endoscope will be disinfected after each use. Based on the results of these 
tests, you may be deemed ineligible to participate. In such instances, you will be compensated for the time 
you participated at a prorated rate of $10 per hour.   
 
If you are deemed eligible to participate, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire that focus es on your 
medical history which includes questions about your Parkinson’s disease, general health, medications, and 
any speech and voice problems you may be experiencing. You may skip any question that you feel 
uncomfortable answering.  We will also ask you to release a test score from your neurologist to us which 
indexes the severity of your Parkinson’s disease. You do not need to agree to this release  to participate in 
the study. In addition, you will undergo a brief heading screening which requires you to listen for tones and 
raise your hand when you hear the tone.    
 
In addition, you will be asked to wear a microphone and perform a variety of speaking tasks including, but 
not limited to reading sentences, short passages, and/or citing a monologue. You will also be asked to 
perform different breathing exercises while wearing nose clips including breathing in and out as much as 
you can into a cardboard mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. The nose clips and mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_447737]. You will also be fitted with elasticized bands that are worn on the outside your clothing around 
your rib cage and abdomen. The bands do not impede your ability to breathe. We will ask you to breathe 
quietly, to breathe in and out as much air as you can, and to move your abdomen in and out. You will also 
be asked to talk about a topic of interest for several minutes. Lastly, we will place a mask over your mouth 
and nose. The mask will measure the air as it comes out of your mouth. A small tube will be placed between 
your lips and behind your teeth. It will not impede your ability to talk. We will ask you to read a sentence 
several times with the mask in place. The mask and tube will be disinfected after each use. You may take 
breaks as needed or cease participation at any time. You have just completed your pre-treatment lab session. 
You will be asked to perform these tasks again in week 4 (mid-treatment) and week 8 (end of treatment).

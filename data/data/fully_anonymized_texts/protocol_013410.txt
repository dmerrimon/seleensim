3 BACKGROUND  
3.1  Nasal Endoscopy  
The paranasal sinuses are 4 pairs of air-filled bony spaces that surround the nasal cavity and are 
lined with mucous membrane densely covered with cilia that facilitates mucociliary clearance and 
drainage into the nasal cavity. Infection of sinuses, or rhinosinusitis (RS), is caused when 
mucociliary functionality is compromised and/or the sinus ostia is compromised causing the 
sinuses to become congested and eventually blocked. RS is a severely debilitating quality of life 
condition, which is characterized by [CONTACT_5927], purulent nasal 
discharge, and nasal obstruction. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic disease that involves 
long-term inflammation of the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa with a minimum duration of 12 
weeks. CRS causes not only physical suffering, but also impacts psychological wellbeing and 
daily functioning.  CRS is an extremely common condition, affecting 29.2 million (14.2%) US 
adults. 
Nasal endoscopy is the most important diagnostic tool currently available to otolaryngologists to 
diagnose sino-nasal disorders [1]. Current endoscopes perform well at allowing otolaryngologists 
to evaluate the nasal cavity. When anatomy is favorable, endoscopes also visualize regions 
externally adjacent to the sinus ostia, but do not allow visualization, culture, or lavage of the sinus 
cavity without extensive prior surgical opening.   
The endpoints of nasal endoscopy include the ability to diagnose the patient’s condition and obtain 
a nasal culture that has some correlation with the sinus cavity contents [2]. The limitations include 
the inability to steer into or around narrow anatomy, to obtain an intra-sinus culture, and to 
visualize the sinus cavity.  
A CT scan is required when diagnosing chronic sino-nasal disorders like CRS. A CT scan 
provides information as to whether the sinus is clear or opacified, but is often limited in providing 
information as to what is opacifying the sinus cavity [3]. Most importantly, CT scan is associated 
with radiation exposure harmful to the patient and should be avoided if possible.  
Sinusway, a flexible, steerable endoscope, overcomes current technological limitations by 
[CONTACT_5928], and irrigation. Sinusway does not pose any risk additional to the 
minor risks already associated with current sino-nasal endoscopy; furthermore, the risks of 
bleeding, pain are reduced due to the flexibility and small profile of the device which minimizes 
contact [CONTACT_5929].  The risk of infection is eliminated as the intra-nasal component of the 
device is a one-time single use disposable and does not require re-sterilization between patients. 
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page 10 of 29 
   3.2 Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) and Balloon Sinus Dilation (BSD) 
The objective of FESS is to open the natural pathways to the sinuses. Once an improved drainage 
system is achieved, the diseased sinus mucosa has an opportunity to return to normal. FESS 
involves the insertion of endoscope into the nose for a direct visual examination of the openings 
into the sinuses.  Diseased or obstructive sinus tissue may be removed resulting in improved 
natural sinus drainage. 
There are several sinus surgery options that can be performed in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5897]’s office. Balloon sinus dilation (BSD) is a minimally invasive surgery that can be 
performed in both settings. A small balloon is inserted into the nose; once in the right spot, it is 
inflated to open and drain blocked sinus pathways. The goal of balloon sinus surgery is to unblock 
sinus pathways and improve symptoms, reduce infections, minimize sinus headaches and restore 
quality of life. When performed in the doctor's office, it offers faster recovery times and may allow 
eligible patients to have a lower out-of-pocket cost. 
3.[ADDRESS_5201] may use the device in an operating room (OR) or an office setting, for 
visualization and for irrigation at anatomic landmarks, including the sinuses cavities, currently 
inaccessible by [CONTACT_5930].  
3NT endoscopy system (See figure 1 below) includes: 
1. A Multi-use handle accessory (re-processible and auto-clavable) – engages the single-use 
endoscope component and allows the user to mechanically control its articulation through 
dedicated levers. (see Figure 1, Reusable Handle) 
2. A Single-use flexible endoscope (provided sterile) – includes a distal tip CMOS imager and an 
integrated working channel which allows irrigation through a single channel. It is the only part that 
comes in contact [CONTACT_5931]. (see Figure 2, 
Disposable Endoscope). 
3. A Camera control unit (CCU) – includes a video processor and a white LED light source. The 
CCU includes an attachment cable which connects to the single-use endoscope, receives video 
images from the endoscope, and delivers LED light to the endoscope. 
 
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_5202] endoscope contains an articulation mechanism that supports angulation of 125˚ and 
advancement of the insertion tube over the angulated section and beyond it, effectively keepi[INVESTIGATOR_5898] (See Figure 3). 
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_5203]-operative nasal bleeding, faster 
recovery time, shorter duration of prescription medication use and short term symptom improvement 
than traditional FESS. [4] 

 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_5204] endoscope was evaluated during eleven (11) functional endoscopic sinus surgeries 
(FESS) occurring in the operating room under general anesthesia. Six (6) cases were performed in 
two sites in Israel: Assuta M.C.(3) and Rabin M.C.(3).  Five cases were performed at the 
University of Ghent, Belgium. Mean Subject age was 44.3 Years [23-60 yrs], [ADDRESS_5205] in patients in 
terms of access and visualization of the nasal anatomy and paranasal sinuses, usability (alone and in 
conjunction with balloon dilation instruments), visualization quality, and irrigation. 
For this study, up to [ADDRESS_5206] 
before and as part of balloon dilation in the operation room (OR) or office setting (Office). Additional 
endoscopes as available in the procedure room and as commonly used by [CONTACT_5932]. 
4.1 Safety assessment  
Safety assessment will be based upon monitoring the adverse device effects, which will be collected 
throughout the procedure. 
All adverse events and serious adverse events will be reported in accordance with reviewing Ethics 
Committee  /Institutional Review Board (IRB), FDA and Competent authority requirements. 
4.2 Performance assessment 
1. Ability to access the nasal anatomy and paranasal sinuses: Ability to access and visualize 
anatomic landmarks, including the maxillary, frontal and sphenoid sinuses, will be recorded. 
Successful access will be confirmed by [CONTACT_5933]. 
 
2. Usability evaluation 
 
3. Irrigation evaluation  
4. Nasal cavity and sinuses inflammation evaluation  
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page 14 of 29 
    
5. Patient pain score and tolerability, when applicable  
4.3 Study End Points 
 Primary - Safety 
All adverse device effects will be captured and summarized as defined in Section-8.   Adverse device 
effects (type, frequency, severity) are expected to be similar to those reported in literature for Nasal 
Endoscopy (section 8).  
For this study, the Safety comparison with the data of Nasal Endoscopy reported in literature will be 
descriptive with no statistical endpoints.   
 Secondary - Performance 
 To evaluate the ability to access and visualize the nasal anatomy including the maxillary, 
frontal, and sphenoid sinuses (according to physician discretion).  This ability will be verified 
by [CONTACT_5934] (as Done/Not Done/Failed). 
 
 To evaluate usability and user satisfaction-  by [CONTACT_5925] a usability questionnaire regarding the 
device, including assessment of visualization quality. Will be completed by [CONTACT_5935] – Performance 
 To evaluate irrigation of the nasal anatomy (as Done/Not Done, which sinus was irrigated)  
 To evaluate nasal cavity inflammation and sinuses inflammation using Lund Mackay CT score 
and Lund Kennedy Endoscopic scoring 
 Patient tolerability and Pain assessment will be recorded by a 0-10 scale (when applicable ) 
 
 
[ADDRESS_5207] Enrollment 
a)  Patients who appear to be eligible will be asked if they would like to participate in this study.  
b) Written informed consent will be obtained from each participating patient prior to collecting a 
patient history or other testing. The patient will be counseled concerning the research nature of this 
study, and the risks and possible benefits to participation. Participation is fully voluntary.  
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_5208] 
2. Patient age: adult (>18 years old) 
3. Patients in general good health in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_5899] 
4. A patient who is able to understand the requirements of the study, is willing to comply with its 
instructions and schedules, and agrees to sign the informed consent 
5.4 Exclusion Criteria 
1. Known history of any significant medical disorder, which in the investigator’s judgment 
contraindicates the patient's participation 
2. Patients with known current or previous bleeding disorder receiving anticoagulants (e.g., chronic 
Coumadin treatment) 
[ADDRESS_5209], will be tested in a single group of adult patients, male or females. 
The rationale behind this feasibility study is to show that access and visualization of the nasal anatomy 
and paranasal sinuses (Maxillary, Frontal and Sphenoid sinuses) in conjunction with Balloon Sinus 
Dilation in patients suffering from symptoms attributable to sinusitis is feasible in the office and 
operating room settings; This is an essential step in the development of a combined dilation and 
visualization system that will allow visualization, dilation and lavage of the sinuses via their  natural 
ostia during an office visit, and minimize radiation exposure, antibiotic use, multiple office visits, and 
cost. 
This study is proposed after completing a series of clinical cases, which demonstrated that the system is 
safe and performed well to physician's satisfaction (detailed information on the studies is provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure). 
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page 16 of 29 
    Measures to Minimize Bias 
No control groups and no randomization will be utilized in this study since its primary objectives are to 
obtain information on safety, tolerability and usability which may serve as a basis for modification (if 
required) and future controlled studies. 
6.2 Study Procedures 
 Visits 1: Screening 
 Screening will take place within 1 day-30 days before the procedure. 
 Patients potentially qualifying for the study will be offered an Informed Consent to sign prior to 
further evaluation.   Any patients not qualifying will be exited from the study as screening 
failures and will not be included in the safety/effectiveness analyses.   
 The following screening assessments will be performed at pre-study for each patient: 
- Medical history (including concomitant medications) 
- Sino-Nasal outcome test (SNOT-20)  
- Vital signs (optional) 
- CT 
- Laboratory blood work within 6 months including Hematocrit, White Blood Cells , PT, PTT, 
INR, Creatinine and Glucose (optional, only if done prior to surgery)

undergo the Sinusway evaluation. 
  
 Visit 2: Procedure and Study Termination 
 Before the procedure: 
- Eligible subject/s will attend the Medical Center at the day of procedure and will be inquired by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_5900]. If at this point it is 
determined that the patient does not meet all Inclusion and Exclusion criteria and cannot be 
treated, the patient will be exited from the study.  These patients will be considered screening 
failures, and will not be included in any of the safety or efficacy endpoint analyses.   
 Endoscopy: 
1. Patients may undergo BSD under local anesthesia, intravenous sedation and local anesthesia or 
under general anesthesia, at physician discretion.  
2. The Sinusway device will be prepared for use per its instructions for use. 
 
3. Evaluation of the patient with physician’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_5901](s). Visualization of the 
sinuses (frontal, maxillary, sphenoid) will be recorded as performed/failed and an Image of the 
anatomic landmark will be taken.  
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page 17 of 29 
   4. Following the Evaluation with physician’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_5901](s) the evaluation will be 
repeated using the Sinusway endoscope. Access to the sinuses (frontal, maxillary, sphenoid) 
will be recorded as performed/failed and an Image of the anatomic landmark will be taken. 
Nasal Cavity and sinuses inflammation score will be captured using the Lund Mackay CT and 
endoscopy score. 
5. BSD procedure will be performed with either endoscope.  
6. Irrigation of the nasal anatomy will be performed and recorded as Done/Not Done and which 
sinus was irrigated. 
7. Following the BSD procedure, repeated evaluation of patient's sinuses and nasal cavity will be 
performed using the Sinusway endoscope 
8. Usability assessment will be completed by [CONTACT_5936]. 
9. If applicable, patient pain assessment using a 0-10 pain Scale and patient tolerability will be 
captured (Office procedures only) 
 After the procedure: 
- The patient will recover from the procedure per physician’s common practice. Before patient's 
release, recording of AE, if any, will be performed. Patient will exit the study.

   7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND SAMPLE SIZE 
Statistical Considerations 
No statistical analysis will be used as this is a feasibility safety study. 
Sample Size 
Up to Fifteen (15) patients are expected to complete the study at all sites 
[ADDRESS_5211] device has been conducted as part of FDA 510k submission (K162916).  
This risk analysis is applicable to the proposed clinical investigation.  The potential risks described 
below will be explained to the subject in the informed consent process. 
8.1 Potential risks – (Sinusway): 
Endoscopy is a minimally invasive, diagnostic medical procedure.   Overall, nasal endoscopy is a safe 
and low risk procedure. Nonetheless, potential complications such as mucosal trauma and bleeding may 
occur, particularly in susceptible patients with increased risk of bleeding, such as those receiving aspi[INVESTIGATOR_5902] (i.e. Plavix, Coumadin, etc.). In addition, adverse reactions to the 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_5903].  
Since the Sinusway endoscope will be used in conjunction with balloon sinus dilation, the following 
risks which are associated with BSD and/or endoscopic sinus surgery are presented. 
Risk associated with Endoscopic Sinus Surgery  
Surgeons performing routine endoscopic interventions are faced with minor complications in 5% and 
major complications in 0.5–1% [21] 
 Infection-  A patient with sinusitis is at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_5904] (abscesses, meningitis, etc.) 
Infection risk increases with the invasiveness of the intervention. The rate of intracranial infections 
where the intervention is maximized is 1.6% and the rate of infection-related mortality is 0.125%. 
It is comparable to the one of transcranial surgeries not involving the use of an endoscope [5,6,7]. 
The Risk of Infection following Sinusway use is mitigated since the Sinusway endoscope is a 
disposable intended for single use only.   
 Bleeding- Bleeding may occur, particularly in susceptible patients with increased risk of bleeding, 
such as those receiving aspi[INVESTIGATOR_5905] (i.e. Plavix, Coumadin, etc.) 
[20]. The rate of peri- or postoperative bleeding is around 2% altogether; transfusions were 
required in about 0.2% of cases [8,9]. 
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page 20 of 29 
    Nasomucosal injury- Nasomucosal injury may occur during transnasal endoscopy. Nasomucosal 
injury was assessed in 1569 patient that underwent unsedated transnasal 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), at termination of the procedure. Normal mucosa was 
observed in 68% of cases, redness of mucosa was observed in 19% of cases, oozing hemorrhage 
was observed in 12% of cases and overt bleeding was observed in 2% of cases. The hemorrhage 
was self-limiting and no patient required nasopharyngeal treatment [10].  
 CSF leakage - Small and isolated CSF fistulas, which are treated at once successfully, are 
considered as minor complication in sinus surgeries [11]. These particular incidents are not rare – 
in a survey, 25% of American otorhinolaryngologists had experienced at least one unexpected 
CSF fistula intraoperatively during endoscopic sinus surgeries within 5 years [12]. The rate of 
unexpected dura exposure is reported with a percentage of 0.2% [8]. The number of minimal, 
temporary and occult leakage of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_5906], is significantly higher [13]. Once a small cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_5907], 
references recommend conservative treatment to begin with [12, 14, 15, 16]. In a few cases lumbar 
drainage was solely carried out [17]. However, in case of a persisting leak encountered during 
routine sinus surgeries or e.g. after rhino-neurosurgical procedures, surgical treatment should be 
pursued even with small defects.  
 Orbital hematoma -  The incidence of orbital hematomas is around 0.1% in all procedures [18, 19]. 
Visual loss and blindness have been reported but are extremely rare. Another uncommon problem 
is damage to the muscles that  move the eye, leading to double vision, which can be temporary or 
permanent. In certain circumstances, there may be a change in the function of the tear ducts 
causing excessive tearing. Since the eye is in close proximity to the sinuses, a major orbital 
complication or blindness could possibly occur even without surgery for patients with severe or 
refractory sinus infections. 
 Voice changes - One of the functions of the sinuses is to affect resonance, therefore, there is a 
potential change in the voice after sinus surgery. 
 Impaired sense of taste or smell - The sense of smell usually improves after the procedure because 
airflow is restored, although in sporadic cases it could worsen depending on the extent of swelling, 
infection, or allergy. This impairment is often temporary but can be prolonged. 
 Nasal obstruction, dryness and pain - Although preventative measures are performed by [CONTACT_5938], the cartilage may move after the surgery which may rarely lead 
to persistent blockage. Surgery typi[INVESTIGATOR_5908], but in some patients, it may not 
improve or rarely may worsen. Small scar bands may also occur in the nose and require removal 
by [CONTACT_5939]. Over-aggressive resection of the turbinate structures may 
leave some patients with the sensation of being overly dry or even cause chronic pain. 
  Adverse reactions to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_5909]. Thus, before administering these topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910], patients’ allergies should be verified 
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_5212] (ADE) 
 An "Adverse Device Effect" is an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical 
device.  
 This includes any adverse event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions 
for use, the deployment, the implantation, the installation, the operation, or any malfunction of 
the investigational medical device. 
 This includes any event that is a result of a use error or intentional misuse. 
 "Adverse Events" are defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury 
or any untoward clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, users or 
other persons whether or not related to the investigational medical device. 
 This includes events related to the investigational device. 
 This includes events related to the procedures involved (any procedure in the clinical 
investigation plan). 
 For users or other persons this is restricted to events related to the investigational medical device. 
 All Adverse device effects must be recorded in the CRF. A description of the event, including 
the start date, resolution date, action taken, and the outcome should be provided. 
 
All adverse events will be graded for severity as follows: 
 Grade Degree Description  
1 
Mild Symptom(s) barely noticeable to patient or does not make patient uncomfortable; 
does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily 
needed for relief of symptom(s) but may be given because of personality of patient.  
2 
Moderate Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make patient uncomfortable; performance of 
daily activity is influenced; patient is able to continue in study; treatment for 
symptom(s) may be needed.  
3 
Severe Cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or significant impact on 
patient’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of treatment with study device; 
treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].

the AE relative to the test procedure / device is reasonable; the AE could have been due 
to another equally likely cause;  
Probably not There is evidence of exposure to the test procedure / device; there is another more 
likely cause of the AE  
Definitely not The patient did not receive the test procedure / device; or temporal sequence of the AE 
onset relative to test procedure / device is not reasonable; or there is another obvious 
cause of the AE.  
 
Action taken  - whether or not the adverse event caused the subject to be discontinued from the 
study. 
Clinical Outcome  – whether the adverse event was resolved or ongoing. 
All adverse events, including a worsening of physical examination findings, in comparison with 
baseline values, must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is 
otherwise explained, or the patient is lost to follow-up. 
 
 Anticipated adverse events  
Anticipated adverse device effects include Infection, Excessive Bleeding, Nasomucosal injury, 
CSF leakage, Orbital hematoma, Voice changes, Impaired sense of taste or smell, Nasal 
obstruction, dryness and pain and Adverse reactions to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_5911]. Please refer to section 8.[ADDRESS_5215] (SADE) 
A "Serious Adverse Device Effect" is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A "Serious Adverse Event” is an adverse event that: 
a)  led to a death (Note: In the event of subject death during the conduct of the study, efforts 
should be made to perform an autopsy.) 
b)   led to a serious deterioration in health that either: 
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page 23 of 29 
   1)   resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, or 
2)   resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 
3)  required in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
4)  resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or injury 
or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function   
c)   led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
 This includes device deficiencies that might have led to a serious adverse event if a) 
suitable action had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if 
circumstances had been less fortunate. These are handled under the SAE reporting 
system. 
 A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912]-existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_5941], without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered 
to be a serious adverse event.

8.6 Adverse Event Reporting 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all treatment related and device related 
Adverse Events (ADE’s), which occur during the course of the study.  All ADEs will be recorded 
on the adverse events page of the CRF. Severity and relationship to study device will be assigned 
by [CONTACT_5943]. ADEs will be recorded after the subject has 
been admitted to the clinic Visit-2. 
Any SAE, whether deemed device-related or not, must be reported to the site Ethics Committee 
and to the sponsor as soon as possible after the investigator has become aware of its occurrence 
even if not all the information is available at the time of initial contact. 
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_5218] complete a SAE Form, and send it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event. Accompanying documentation, such as copi[INVESTIGATOR_5913], autopsy report, and other documents when applicable, should be sent as soon as they are 
available. 
The site’s Ethics Committee must also be duly notified and dealt with, according to the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5914]/Ministry of Health regulations. Subjects who have had a SAE must be followed 
clinically until all parameters (including laboratory) have either returned to normal or are 
stabilized.  
[ADDRESS_5219] will be recorded in source data and transmitted to case report forms (CRFs) 
supplied by [CONTACT_1034]. The data will be inserted manually and quality check for errors and omissions 
will be performed to ensure the accuracy of the entered data. 
The source data should be completed during the study by [CONTACT_5944]. All data must be filled out 
using ball pens (not pencils), accurately and promptly following each relevant step of the study. The 
CRF should be completed in full, i.e., no fields should be left blank once the subject has completed the 
study. CRFs entries corrections must be made only by [CONTACT_5945] (single line) incorrect data and writing 
in the revisions. All corrections must be initialed and dated by [CONTACT_5946]/recording the 
correction. If the reason for the change is not obvious, an explanation for the change should be recorded 
and attached to the CRF. Blacking out or using correction fluid or an eraser is not allowed to correct or 
eliminate data. The investigator must review the CRFs for completeness and accuracy and must 
sign/date the forms where indicated. 
The investigator will retain originals of CRFs, subject consent forms, and study data as permanent 
records for a period of 2 years or until the data is no longer required for regulatory purposes (the longest 
between these two). 
[ADDRESS_5220] of this study. The Clinical Monitor’s responsibilities 
include maintaining regular contact [CONTACT_5947]/email contact [CONTACT_5948]-site visits, to ensure that:  
 The trial is conducted according to FDA, ICH-GCP and EN ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 requirements;  
 The Investigational Plan is followed;  
 Complete, timely, and accurate data are submitted;  
 Problems with inconsistent or incomplete data are addressed;  
 Complications and unanticipated adverse effects are reported to the Sponsor and the IRB;  
 The site facilities will be monitored to stay adequate to meet the requirements of the study.  
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_5221] monitoring visit will usually be made as 
soon as possible after enrollment has been initiated. At this visit and all monitoring visits, the Clinical 
Monitor will compare the data entered onto the CRFs with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_893] (source 
documents). Source documentation must be available to substantiate proper informed consent 
procedures, adherence to protocol procedures, adequate reporting and follow-up of AEs, and device 
procedure information. Findings from the review of CRFs and source documents during a monitoring 
visit will be discussed with the PI. Completed paper CRFs will be reviewed prior to data closure at each 
visit. The dates of the monitoring visits will be recorded in a Log to be kept at the clinical site. During 
monitoring visits, the Sponsor expects that the study coordinator and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5915], the source 
documentation will be available, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of Study related 
documents.   
Monitoring procedures will follow the Sponsor SOPs. 
[ADDRESS_5222] be approved by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB prior to implementation. 
No protocol amendments should be adopted without prior written approval from the IRB except  in the 
following cases: 
 In order to eliminate immediate hazard to the subjects 
 Changes involving only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. 
The investigator should document and explain any deviation from the approved protocol and to file 
waivers received from the sponsor, if applicable. The reasons for it, and, if appropriate, the proposed 
protocol amendments should be submitted to: 
1. The Sponsor for agreement 
2. The EC/IRB 
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_5223] devices and imaging/recording system for the 
duration of the study. The systems will be marked “for investigational use” and the investigator is 
responsible for storing the systems in a secure place to avoid unauthorized use. 
Immediately upon completion of the study all systems and unused items will be returned to 3NT 
Medical. 
[ADDRESS_5224] (IRB), Ethics 
Committee, FDA may receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_5916]. 
[ADDRESS_5225] WITHDRAWAL OR DISCONTINUATION 
Any patient will be informed of his right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. 
The Investigator or Sponsor may withdraw a patient from the study at any time if he considers that 
remaining in the study compromises the patient’s health or the patient is not sufficiently cooperative. 
The reasons for any patient withdrawal will be recorded on the study completion form of the CRF.  
The investigator will inform the Sponsor in writing of the subject's early withdrawal for any reason. 
If withdrawal is caused by [CONTACT_5949], 
it will be reported to the EC/IRB and to the Sponsor. 
18 SUSPENSION OR PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for any reason based on (but not 
exclusively) the following criteria: 
 
3NT Medical - Confidential  Page 27 of 29 
    Technical problems in the device. 
 Unanticipated Serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) 
 The Principal Investigator's or the Ethics Committee recommendation 
 Poor performance or compliance of the clinical site 
 Company considerations 
In case of premature termination of the study, the Ethics Committee will be duly informed according to 
the local regulations.

Health Systems IncJustification:  We are aiming to include participants 
who can benefit from the treatment to reduce postoperative 
pain at home and have seen that there is a time lag in pain 
which potentially increases after discharge. Therefore, we are 
amending the final inclusion criteria from Postop pain VAS ≥ [ADDRESS_608474], to VAS >[ADDRESS_608475]. 
2)  Revising the subject demographics questionnaire
Justification: We have added 'Procedure to be Performed, 
Physician performing procedure, Tissue to be Operated On and 
Additional procedure details (such as splints, etc.)' to the 
demographic form to capture additional information that will 
allow us to segment results of the primary endpoint of acute 
change in peak postoperative pain
3)  Updated Post-op timelines day [ADDRESS_608476]-surgeries to accommodate change in patient 
and clinic scheduling that occur for varying reasons 
4) Updated Study Population to expand scope to include 
patients electing for functional nasal surgery, common among 
patients requiring functional rhinoplasty or reconstructive 
surgery  
5) Rephrasing Compensation language 
V1.1 1.17.2024 Increased recruitment numbers from 100 to 130.
Justification: due to high drop-out rate post randomization; 
there is the need to increase the recruitment numbers to reach 
the target of 60 completed participants.

The opi[INVESTIGATOR_474862], addiction, and overdose. 10.[ADDRESS_608481]-operative pain after sinus surgery. The microcurrent study device has yielded auspi[INVESTIGATOR_474863] a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_474864] (FESS). We hypothesize that daily use of the self-administered, handheld, microcurrent study 
device will reduce patients’ pain levels following functional nasal or sinus surgery, thereby [CONTACT_474873].

2.  DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY DEVICE
The study device is a handheld micro-current TENS emitter intended to be used for the relief of 
postoperative pain after functional nasal or sinus surgery .  The device uses an average current that is 
several orders of magnitude smaller than that of TENS devices used in the facial area. The design of the 
study device was optimized to provide transcutaneous nerve stimulation to the regional areas associated 
with the sinuses.
The pear-shaped device is held in the hand, with the rounded tip of the device applied to the facial skin in 
the region of skin overlying the sinus passages for [ADDRESS_608482] with the device. 
If the calculated impedance is above an impedance threshold, the device is in “Detection” mode. 
Conversely, when the impedance falls below the impedance threshold, the device enters a “Treatment”

Health Systems Incmode. The impedance threshold is calculated dynamically by [CONTACT_474874].
The user is instructed to glide the tip of the device along the skin along the cheek, nose and under brow 
bone. When a low-impedance point is detected, the device signals the user via a slight haptic (vibration) 
feedback. The user is instructed to hold the device in place until the Treatment period has passed as 
indicated by [CONTACT_474875].
Once the Treatment period ends, the device resets to Detection mode. The user is instructed to glide the 
device along an indicated path until reaching the next low-impedance area.
The user may adjust the current setting of the device (low, medium, high) if they prefer more or less 
current intensity. The default setting for the device is low.
The study device emits a 14.7 Hz frequency and has previously shown to be safe and well-tolerated in an 
IRB-approved 4 person pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688]. The study device is configured to emit alternating current in 
the microampere range, significantly less energy than has been safely used in TENS treatment of the face 
for pain [1-3].

The sham device appears and operates identically to the active device, including indicator lights and haptic 
vibration, however it emits a weak direct current that is non-therapeutic.

device on postoperative days 0-[ADDRESS_608485] total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) will be administered for each enrolled 
subject. Standard TIVA is as follows: anesthetic induction will be performed using propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg 
and remifentanil 2-5 mcg/kg, with neuromuscular blockade used to facilitate endotracheal intubation only 
if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_474880] (ETT). Anesthesia will be 
maintained using propofol 30-50 mcg/kg/min, remifentanil 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min and nitrous oxide 50-
70% titrated based on hemodynamics to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60-[ADDRESS_608486] dose of 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone prior to the start of surgery, and 4 
mg ondansetron prior to emergence. Vital signs, anesthetic technique (i.e., bolus and infusion drug totals, 
end tidal gas concentrations, narrative comments), and inputs and outputs for the case will be recorded 
to control hemodynamic differences between subjects. No new imaging will be obtained as part of the 
study. In PACU phase II, subjects will report their visual analog scale (VAS) for pain to confirm eligibility 
for the study.  Subjects will complete their first study device treatment in the PACU phase II and study 
staff will record their VAS for pain before treatment and [ADDRESS_608487] their VAS for pain at 2 hours and 4 hours after treatment at home.
The day after surgery, subjects will be reminded by [CONTACT_474881]-administer the 
treatment with the device. Subjects will glide the device over the periorbital skin for 2.5 minutes per side 
of the face (five minutes total) three times every [ADDRESS_608488]-op, whichever 
comes sooner with additional administrations as needed. When in pain, subjects will be instructed to use 
the device and wait ten minutes before using oxycodone 5 mg or acetaminophen 325 mg as rescue pain 
medication if needed. Subjects will complete a daily pain diary (either paper or online via REDCap) 
documenting their pain on a visual analog scale of 0-[ADDRESS_608489] the time and dose of all medications used (either paper or online

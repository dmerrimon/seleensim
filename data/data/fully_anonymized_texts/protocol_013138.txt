1. INTRODUCTION  
This document describes the rules and conventions to be used in the presentation and analysis of 
efficac y, safety , immunogenicity  data for Protocol 1302.3  INVICTAN®-3. It 
describes the data to be summarized and analyzed, including specifics of the statistical analyses to be 
performed.  
The document pertains to : 
 Preliminary  analysis:  the analysis  that will  be performed at the time point of the primary analysis of 
trial 1302.5 , 
 Final analysis:  the final analysis at the end of the trial. 
This trial statistical analysis plan (TSAP) is based on Protocol version 6.0, dated [ADDRESS_553412] bevacizumab (comme rcially available Avastin®, herea fter referred to 
as Avastin®) as soon as it is available at the respective clinical site. Limited safety data (adverse events, 
immunogenicity ) will be analysed for the post -switch period.  
2. TRIAL  OBJECTIVES  
2.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective  of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BI 695502 in combination 
with leucovorin/5 -fluorouracil/oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) and as maintenance therapy (when applicable).  
2.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives are to evaluate  the following efficacy parameters:  
 Progression -free survival (PFS),  
 Objective response (OR) rate (proportion of subject s with complete response [CR] or partial 
response [PR]),  
 Overall survival (OS),  
 Duration of response (DOR),  
 Time to progression (TTP).

2.3. Further Objectives  
The other  objectives of the trial are: 
o To evaluate the presence of anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antidrug 
antibodies ( nADA ). 
3. TRIAL  DESIGN  
3.1. General Description  
This is a Phase IIIb, open -label, multicenter, multinational, single -arm trial. The trial will investigate the 
safety, efficacy,  immunogenicity of BI 695502 (corresponding to the trial medication) in subject s 
with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), who will receive BI 695502 in 
combination with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy every 2 weeks until disease progression, death, 
unacceptable toxicity or  the end of the trial  (See protocol Section 8.6 for ‘end of the trial’  definition) , 
whichever occurs earlie st. Based on subject  tolerability, at least [ADDRESS_553413] s should 
continue to receive infusional 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) +leucovorin  with BI [ADDRESS_553414] . The efficacy analysis will be 
based upon t he evaluation of tumor imaging as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) 1.1 [1] and as assessed by [CONTACT_370381].  
Per t he sponsor ’s [ADDRESS_553415] , bevacizumab  (commercially available Avastin®, hereafter referred to as Avastin®), as 
soon as it is available at the respective clinical site.  The Switch Visit is defined in Section 6.5.  If Avastin® is 
not immediately available, the investigators may temporarily allow continuation  on BI  695502.  
Each s ubject  will continue the study with the same visit schedule as described in the protocol.  
 
Subject s who discontinue treatment with chemotherapy or BI 695502  or Avastin®, but do not have 
disease progre ssion and have not started a new anticancer therapy, will continue in the trial in the non -
treatment period until disease progression or initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs 
first. 
All subject s who receive at least one infusion of BI 695502 will attend a Follow -up visit 30 days (30-day 
FU) after the last BI [ADDRESS_553416] Avastin® dose is administered  whichever occurs later.  
Subjects will attend a long -term Safety Follow -up (SFU) visit [ADDRESS_553417]  continues to receive  treatment with Avastin® beyond [ADDRESS_553418] BI 695502 dose, then no SFU visit will  be performed.

After the long -term SFU visit or discontinuation of Avastin® (whichever occurs later),  all subject s will be 
monitored for survival every [ADDRESS_553419]  assigned 
to trial medication has the 30 -day FU visit  has el apsed , whichever occurs earlier . 
Further details of the trial design can be found in the protocol Section 3.1. 
3.2. Schedule of Events  
Schedule of events can be found in Section s “Flow Chart 1.1 – Cycle 1 to Cycle 13” and “Flow Chart 1.2 
– Cycle 14 Onwards ” of the protocol.  
3.3. Changes to Analysis from Protocol  
The protocol Section [IP_ADDRESS] defines that  a sensitivity analysis  for the objective response (OR)  secondary 
efficacy endpoint  will be performed  using the investigator -assessed  OR. As the OR rate based on the 
investigator  assessment is not defined as an endpoint in protocol Section 5.1 it will be defined as an other 
efficacy endpoint.  
In addition, “further” safety endpoints are defined in protocol Section 5.1.3. These endpoints will be 
renamed to “other” safety  endpoints.  
In protocol Section 7.3, only the treated set, a ll subjects  treated with at least one dose of trial medication , 
is defined.  
Observed value thresholds that define observed dose reductions and increases for Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin 
and 5FU were specified and any dose classified per the definition will be classified as an important 
protocol violation  (See section 13 ). 
Censoring rul es for PFS are defined in protocol Table 7.5.1:1. For harmonization with 1302.5 analysis, a 
more detailed version of censoring rules table will be used compared to the table available in the protocol 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). This more detailed version of the censoring rules table will lead to some deviations 
from the protocol:  
- In case of no baseline assessment: per protocol, the subject ’s PFS time  should be censored at the 
date of first administration of trial medication. However, if the subject died  on or before the second 
planned tumor assessment , e.g. on or before the assessment of a progressive disease would have 
been possible if a baseline assessm ent would have been available, then the subject ’s PFS time  won’t 
be censored and the date of death  will be the date of the event.  
- In case of consecutive missed radiological assessments: per protocol, the subject ’s PFS time  should 
be censored at the date of  last radiological assessment of measured lesions. For the purpose of the 
analysis, “consecutive missed radiological assessments” will be defined as two or more consecutively 
missed tumor radiological assessments . In addition, for the censoring date, the d ate of last

radiological assessment prior to missed tumor assessments will be used.  
- In case of new anticancer therapy  started: per protocol, the subject ’s PFS time  should be censored at 
the date of last radiological assessment of measured lesions. However,  the subject ’s PFS time  will be 
censored only if the new anticancer therapy is initiated before PD and the date of last tumor 
assessment before initiation of new anti -cancer therapy  will be used as censoring date.  
Per protocol Section 5.1.1, the AEs selected for primary safety endpoint include the category “All 
haemorrhages and pulmonary h aemorrhages”. For more clarity, this category will be renamed as “All 
haemorrhages including pulmonary h aemorrhages.  
 
In the protocol, the definition of enrolled subjects is not clear. Per the first paragraph of the  protocol  
Section 3.3, enrolled subjects are subjects who have signed informed consent, while in the second 
paragraph, it is stated that subjects considered screen failures won’t be enrolled in this trial. However , 
screen failures subjects should also have signed an informed consent. Due to this contra diction in the 
protocol and to avoid any confusion in the analysis, the wording “screened” will be used for subjects who 
have signed an informed  consent.  
 
 
 
The following additional analyses will be performed , compared to the analyses planned in the protocol :  
- Section 4.1: Preliminary  analysis  (selected safety parameters) .  
4. PLANNED ANALYSES  
The foll owing analys is will be performed for this trial: 
o Preliminary  Analysis   
o Final  Analysis  
The preliminary  analysis  and final analys is described in this TSAP will be performed by

some important background i nformation . The analysis will be based on treated set (TS)  and will be 
indicated specifically in the table of contents of the output shells.  
This preliminary  analysis will take place at the time point of 1302.5 primary analysis, and the  data cut-off 
for this supportive analysis will coincide with the data cut-off for the primary analysis of 1302.5.  Details 
of the cut -off date used for 1302.3 can be found in APPENDIX 5 . 
For the purposes of this supportive analysis, all  safety data  observed prior to the  cut-off date will be 
cleaned.  
No Clinical Trial Report  (CTR) will be produced for this preliminary analysis , rather a selection of 
display s that will be identified in the table of contents . 
4.2. Final  Analysis  
The final analysis will be performed at the end of the trial.  
This final analysis  will include all analyses specified in the TSAP on the global population. That is to say, 
the analyses of the primary safety , as well as , all secondary and other efficacy endpoints and safety, 
immunogenicity ,  background information data. The analysis  will be based on the TS, SWS   
  
The final analysis will take place after the last treated subject in the trial will have received his / her last 
treatment  and completed the relevant follow -up, e.g. at time of last subject last planned visit (including 
non-treatment period [NTP] and follow -up visits) .  
For efficacy analysis , data for switched subjects will be considered censored at the switch visit.  There 
will be no analysis  of efficacy or laboratory data post -switch.  
Post-switch data will only be tabulated where specified in the relevant sections below. All availabe post -
switch data will be listed.  
For safety analysis post -switch, AEs that started  on the Switch Visit  up to the 30 -day follow -up visit will 
be handled as treatment emergent . 
   
 All data will be cleaned and evaluated and the results summarized in the CTR.  
5. ANALYSIS SETS 
A data review meeting will be set up to decide on the final allocation rules to assign subjects to the 
analysis sets.

5.1.  Screened Set [ SCR] 
The screened  (SCR ) set will contain all subjects who  provide informed consent for this trial. 
5.2. Treated  Set [ TS] 
The treated  set (TS) will contain all subjects who signed informed consent and who receive at least one 
dose of trial medication.  
If there is any doubt as to whether a sub ject was treated or not  (for example, a subject with date of 
administration of trial medication and/or start dose available but the information on the total dose 
administered is missing) , he/she will be assumed treated for the purposes of analysis.  
5.3. Switched  Set [SWS] 
The Switched Set (SWS) will contain all subjects who provided verbal informed consent to switch to 
commercial Avastin® and who received at least one dose of Avastin® post-switch.  
The SWS is applicable for the post -switch period  (see Section 6.7 for definition)  analyses . 
Note that d ata for subjects who had completed treatment, or were no longer in the study at the time of 
the switch will be analysed to the extent available. These subjects will not have performed a Switch 
Visit, and to disti nguish from the Switched Set are referred to as ‘non -switched’ subjects. Data for ‘non -
switched’ subjects will be analy zed to the extent available and corresponds to the pre -switch period only 
(see Section 6.7 for definition).

6. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
6.1. Reference Start Date and Study Day  
Study Day will be calculated from the reference start date, and will be used to show s tart/stop day of 
assessments and events .  
For the pre -switch period , the reference start date (Study Day 1) is de fined as the date of the first dose 
of trial medication . For subjects assigned  to trial medication but not treated , it is the day of assignment  
to trial medication  (as recorded on electronic Case Report Form [ eCRF ] page “Eligibility”) . This will be 
applied for all endpoints except for DOR  where the first documented CR or PR date will be used as 
reference start date . 
For the post-switch period  (see Section 6.7 for definition) , the reference start date (Study Day 1) is 
defined as the day o f first dose of Avastin® post-switch.  This is applicable for SWS . 
Reference start date or study day will appear in every listing where an assessment date or event date 
appears.  
If the start date of the event is on or after the reference start date then:  
o Study Day = (start date of event – reference start date) + 1.  
If the start date of the event is prior to the reference start date then:  
o Study Day = (start date of event – reference start date).  
In the situation where the event date is partial or missing, Study Day,  and any corresponding durations , 
will appear as partial or missing in the listings.  For tables, the imputation rules from APPENDIX [ADDRESS_553421] non -missing measurement taken prior to 
reference start date (including unscheduled assessments). In the cas e where the last non -missing 
measurement (date  and time, whenever time is recorded)  and the reference start date /time  coincide, 
then that measurement will be considered as baseline . Adverse Events (AEs) a nd medications 
commencing on the reference start dat e will be considered  as happening on-treatment .

6.4. Windowing Conventions  
This section describes the windows used for the  statistical analysis  of tumor assessment  in this trial.  
For the analysis of PFS , TTP , DOR  and ORR  the following windows will be used : 
    
Tumor Assessment Windows : 
Assessment Number    Window  
Tumor assessment 1 ( Cycle 5)  from Day 1* to Day 84 
Tumor assessment 2 ( Cycle 9) from Day 85 to Day 140  
Tumor assessment 3 ( Cycle 13) from Day 141 to Day 196  
Tumor assessment 4 (Cycle 17) from Day 197 to Day 252 
Tumor assessment 5 (Cycle 21) from Day 253 to Day 308 
Tumor assessment 6 (Cycle 27) from Day 309 to Day 392 
… … 
From Cycle 28 onwards, the tumor assessments should be performed at every  12 weeks  (meaning every 84 days).

Section 6. 7 for definition) .  
6.5. Switch V isit  
The Switch Visit is defined as the visit on which commercial Avastin® was administer ed for the first time.  
The assessments to be performed at the switch (prior to Avastin® administration) are specified in the 
Protocol (Flow Chart 1.2).  
6.6. Safety Follow  Up Visit 
All subjects  are required to return for a Saf ety Follow Up (SFU)  Visit [ADDRESS_553424] continues to receive treatment with Avastin® beyond [ADDRESS_553425] dose 
of trial medication in the pre -switch period  (See Section 6. 7 for definition) , then no SFU will be 
performed.  
After the SFU Visit or discontinuation of Avastin® (whichever occurs later) subjects will be monitored for 
survival every [ADDRESS_553426] survival inform ation is retrieved from the eCRF page “Survival Information” for the last visit 
performed in the Survival period.  
6.7. Definition  of Pre -switch and Post -switch P eriod  
The pre -switch period  is defined as the period up until the Switch Visit. For non -switched su bjects , this

15.2.1.  Secondary Efficacy Variables & Derivations  
To analyze tumor response, one may need to determine the date of tumor assessment. If there are 
more than one tumor assessment in a given  tum or assessment window, then the data for the scan with 
the most recent date, i.e., the last tumor ass essment in that window will be used.  
The date of disease progression is defined as  the date of radiological diagnosis  of PD  for subject s 
progressed according  to central review assessment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  PROGRESSION -FREE SURVIVAL  
Progression -free survival ( PFS) time is defined as the time from first administration of  trial medication   
until disease progression as assessed by [CONTACT_436799]  1.1 or death from 
any cause  for the Pre -Switch Period  (as collected on ‘ End of Treatment’, ‘Safety Follow -up’ and 
‘Survival Information’ pages of  eCRF) , whichever occurs first . 
For non -switche d subjects, PFS time will be censored on the date of the last adequate tumor 
assessment for subjects who do not have an event ( PD or death) or for subjects with an  event after two 
or more subsequent missing response assessments . 
For the SWS, PFS time will be censored at the last tumor assessment at or prior to the Switch Visit  for 
subjects who do not have an event (PD or death) for the pre -switched period . 
Subjects who do not have a baseline tumor assessment or who do not have any  post-baseline tumor 
assessment  will have PFS time  censored at first administration of trial medication  time unless death 
occurred on or before the time of the second planned tumor assessment in which case the death will be 
considered as an event.

[IP_ADDRESS].  OBJECTIVE RESPONSE RA TE 
The objective response of  each subject will be classified according to the following  RECIST 1.1 
categories based on  independent central review, irrespective of protocol violations or missing data:  
 Complete response (CR),  
 Partial response (PR),  
 Stable disease (SD),  
 Progressive disease (PD),  
 Not applicable (NA),  
 Not evaluable (NE).  
The OR rate is  defined as  the proportion of subject s achieving a n unconfirmed  CR or PR after the start 
of treatment.  
OR will be evaluated  for each subject separately  from the date of first administration of trial medication  
(i.e. Study Day 1)  until either : 
 Progression  according to RECIST 1.1 based on independent central re view,  
 Unacceptable toxicity defined by [CONTACT_436800]  
 Death as reported in the eCRF  
 Switching treatment  
 End of trial  without switching treatment , 
whichever occurs first.

[IP_ADDRESS].  ANALYS IS OF PROGRESSION -FREE SURVIVAL  
The PFS  will be analyzed descriptively using Kaplan -Meier (KM)  estimates .The 1-year PFS rate and 
median PFS  time will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals and will displayed in a summary table. 
The CI for 1 -year PFS rates will be determined using Greenwood’s variance estimate  [2]. The CI for the 
median  PFS time  will be calculated according to the Brookmeyer  and Crowley method [3]. 
In addition,  the KM survival  rate will be presented graphically. The number of subjects at risk, as well as 
the number of events, the 1 -year PFS rate and median PFS  time will also be provided in  the same figure.  
This figure will also be provided by [CONTACT_6496].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  ANALYSIS OF  DURATION OF RESPONSE , TIME TO PROGRESSION A ND OVERALL 
SURVIVAL  
The DOR, TTP and OS will be analyzed descriptively using KM estimates , in the same manner as for the 
PFS (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The 1 -year rate will not be calculated for the DOR.  
Kaplan -Meier estimates of duration of follow -up will also be presented, with the ‘event’ defined as the point 
at which the subject was ce nsored for the original survival analysis.  For this analysis, subjects who died 
are considered to be censored at the time at which the death occurred.

B Cell Induction in Pediatric Lung Transplantation                         Version 4.0-July 16, 2018   1. Study Hypothesis/Objectives 1.1. Hypothesis Rituximab induction along with standard of care immunosuppression will improve outcomes following pediatric lung transplantation by [CONTACT_692462] (DSA) and to lung expressed self-antigens and by [CONTACT_66252] T-cell autoimmunity and alloimmunity without compromising patient safety. 1.2. Primary Objective To determine whether rituximab induction along with standard of care immunosuppression will improve outcomes following pediatric lung transplantation. 1.3. Secondary Objectives 1. To determine the effects of rituximab induction on post-transplant immunity in pediatric lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 2. To assess the safety and tolerability of rituximab. 3. To assess the feasibility of a phone based intervention to decrease tacrolimus trough level variability.

Further, data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) supports that while survival has improved marginally, improvements in short-term survival account for this difference2. In addition, outcomes in both pediatric and adult lung transplantation are significantly worse than outcomes following transplantation of other solid organs. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_692378] T-cell depleting induction therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 5-year survival has not been significantly impacted1. Five year survival has only increased incrementally from 51% to 53% in the most recent report.  Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and morbidity/mortality  BOS is the primary and most significant cause of long term morbidity and mortality after human lung transplantation (LTx) and reports from two large centers have shown the prevalence of BOS is 60% to 80% in [ADDRESS_939140] recent statistics show 14% of pediatric patients develop bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) within the first year after transplantation, which is unchanged from 5 years ago1,7. The incidence of BOS within 4 years of transplant ranges from 31% in infants < 1 year at transplant to 54% in children > 12 at transplant and up to 80% between 5 and 10 years in adults 1,7-9. Between 25 and 40% of lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_692379] 1,3. While retransplantation for late lung allograft failure is feasible, limited organ availability can preclude rapid retransplantation and, more importantly, the survival after a second pediatric lung transplant is significantly worse than the primary transplantation particularly if performed within one year of the primary transplant 10-13. Immunologic basis for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome BOS is a fibroproliferative process leading to obliteration of tubular structures in the organ 9,14. Putative etiologies of BOS include acute rejection, infection, reperfusion injury, drug toxicity, and lung denervation. However, the bulk of evidence suggests BOS is caused by [CONTACT_692463][INVESTIGATOR_171518] 15. Current understanding, derived from animal models of skin, heart, islet, tracheal and more recently, heterotopic lung transplant rejection, are that allograft injury, including many forms of chronic allograft injury, are T cell dependent16. Together this body of literature indicates both naïve and memory T cells, either directly recognizing donor allogeneic MHC or indirectly recognizing donor derived allogeneic (and or minor antigenic, mH) peptides expressed in the context of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_692380]16-18. Increasing experimental evidence further indicates that transplantation-associated inflammation can by[CONTACT_692464]-tolerance mechanisms resulting in expansion of autoreactive T (and B cells) that contribute to allograft injury19-22. T cells reactive to heart-expressed cardiac myosin (CM) participate in murine heart transplant rejection and T cells reactive to lung-expressed type V collagen (ColV) mediate lung transplant injury.  In addition to the antigen specificity, the frequency of responding CD4 and CD8 T cells and their induced effector functions (including cytokine profiles and cytotoxic potential) contribute to the pathogenicity of the transplant-induced immune response23,24. 
CTOT-C Confidential Page [ADDRESS_939141] comprehensive analysis of T cell immunity in children ever reported.  Preliminary findings reveal donor reactive T cells, as well as kα1T-reactive T cells, are detectable in a significant minority of children prior to and following lung transplantation.  It is essential to note that T cells function optimally in the context of interactions with other immune cells, including B cells.  T-B interactions are bidirectional.  T cell expressed CD154 interactions with B cell expressed CD40, along with T cell derived cytokines, provide helper signals for B cells to undergo an isotype switch (e.g. from IgM to IgG). The resultant antibodies to mismatched donor-MHC and or autoantigen are key contributors to acute and chronic allograft injury16.  Work from Mohanakumar and colleagues showed that antibodies to kα1T and ColV are strongly associated with lung transplant injury in adults29,30.   Antibodies to MHC as well as autoantibodies can cause obliterative airway disease in mice.[ADDRESS_939142] disease (OAD) in a transgenic murine model 32. Recently his group has also shown that antibodies to kα1T when given intraperitoneally following syngeneic lung transplantations in a murine model of orthotopic left lung transplantation can result in OAD (abstract presented at ISHLT, Prague, 2012). Potential mechanisms of antibody mediated injury at the effector site, largely derived from studies in animals, include complement mediated injury, macrophage/NK cell mediated injury via FcR binding, and direct stimulation of the target cell by [CONTACT_118520].   Vascular rejection and development of anti-HLA antibodies were associated with chronic allograft rejection in humans 33,34. Mohanakumar and colleagues showed anti-HLA is associated with development of BOS after LTx in adults [ADDRESS_939143] recognition, production of cytokines and  secretion of allo-Ab 36-38. Mohanakumar’s studies demonstrated T-cells from LTx recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (LTxR) with BOS can recognize donor HLA-I & II peptides 36,39,40. Moreover, this work showed anti-HLA can activate human airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (AEC) resulting in growth factor production which play an important role in BOS 41.  Independent of antibody production, B cells are also found within the lung at sites of inflammation/rejection and were shown to be associated with the late development of BOS.  Intriguingly, while mice administered anti-MHC developed OAD associated with an increased number of lung infiltrating B cells (2.3±0.6x106 vs. 0.9±0.4x106cells, p<0.05), mice lacking B cells did not develop OAD following administration of anti-MHC antibodies.31,42  Testing whether B cell depletion prevents B cell infiltrates in the lung and thereby [CONTACT_692465]. B cells also process and present donor antigen with appropriate costimulatory signals to T cells, raising the intriguing hypothesis that B cell depletion could prevent T cell activation by [CONTACT_2869] a key antigen presenting cell (APC) in cellular immune responses.  Experiments performed in mice43,[ADDRESS_939144] of B cell depletion on outcome and T cell alloimmunity respectively.   While the above discussion focuses on the pathogenic role of T-cells and B cells, both T-cells and B cells can function as regulatory/suppressor cells to control pathogenic immunity.  Regulatory T-cells (Treg) have many phenotypes with the principal one being CD4+CD25+Foxp3+.  These regulatory cells exert control over other T cells through multiple mechanisms including CTLA4 induced inhibition of APCs, secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines (TGFb, IL-10) and adenosine metabolism via CD39. Regulatory, IL-[ADDRESS_939145] been reported to function in part by [CONTACT_48937]/propagating Treg.

Rituximab has been safely used in pediatric patients In pediatrics, rituximab is safe when used for multiple indications including B-cell leukemia/lymphoma, relapsing minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, calcineurin-dependent nephrotic syndrome and progressive IgA nephropathy.[ADDRESS_939150]-transplant lymphoproliferative disease in solid organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_692384].62  Further, rituximab has been reported in limited numbers of pediatric lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_692385], AMR and capi[INVESTIGATOR_53076].63,64 Several protocols for hematopoietic stem cell transplant report safely using rituximab as adjunctive therapy to T-cell depleting induction; this is similar to the proposed intervention arm but in a novel population, pediatric lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The safety of rituximab in pediatric transplantation is underscored by a recent review of 42 pediatric children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692386] 30% of pediatric rituximab use is in pediatric transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].65 Rituximab has been used with some efficacy in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_692387]-existing antibodies.  In adult transplantation, trials evaluating rituximab as induction in sensitized kidney recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], unsensitized kidney (RESTARRT) and heart recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (CTOT-11) are ongoing.  Induction with rituximab was successfully reported in a double-blind, placebo controlled study of adult kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_692388]-transplant infection.[ADDRESS_939151]-transplant nephrotic syndrome recurrence (mediated by [CONTACT_692468]) with rituximab.[ADDRESS_939152]-transplant anti-HLA antibodies were randomized to receive 2 (adults) or 4 (children) doses of rituximab or placebo to assess for differences in chronic allograft function (CTOT-02).  Data from kidney transplantation suggests that at least 2 doses are needed to achieve effective B-cell clearance. 69,70  Use in adult pre-transplant desensitization and adult lung transplantation antibody therapy While isolated B-cell depleting induction (without T-cell directed induction) was found to be inadequate with increased risk of acute T-cell mediated cellular rejection in one study,[ADDRESS_939153] DSA and self-antigens (Ka1T and colV) rituximab was used as part of an antibody depleting regimen.  Patients who cleared either DSA or self-directed antibodies were less likely to progress to BOS than patients with persistent antibody.76,[ADDRESS_939154]-transplant period is critical for the development of adaptive immunity (both cellular and humoral).  Therefore depletion of the B-cell population during this period will reduce or eliminate the development of adaptive humoral responses to donor antigens and exposed cryptic lung self-proteins and add to the reduction in cellular immunity by [CONTACT_692469] B-cells available to serve as APCs.  We considered other potential interventions to affect antibody mediated pathology including intravenous immunoglobulin or bortezomib (which depletes plasma cells); however, rituximab was chosen due to the established safety profile in pediatric transplant patients coupled with the greatest potential biological impact (i.e. prevention of antibody development via depletion of specific B-cell subsets as opposed to strategies directed at antibody removal).    Thus our primary hypothesis is that induction with rituximab (in combination with Thymoglobulin) will improve outcomes following pediatric lung transplantation through a decrease in antibody development post-transplant.   The regimen of 375mg/m2 was chosen based on manufacturer labeling for current indications, safety profile and historical pediatric experience with rituximab.  In light of the information from prior studies using a single dose of rituximab a second dose is scheduled at day [ADDRESS_939155]-transplant consistent with the study design of the adult heart transplant study (CTOT-11). We will assess the level of B cell reduction in the first 8 participants using flow cytometry to ensure B cell reduction in this patient population is equivalent to B cell reduction obtained in other studies.   2.3. Preclinical Experience In the murine model for OAD previously established in the Mohanakumar lab, non-complement fixing MHC class I Abs were administered intra-tracheally to wild type mice and complement factor C3 knock out (C3KO) mice. Both groups developed OAD as evidenced by [CONTACT_692470] (Figure 1).  This was associated with development of T-helper (Th)-17 type immune responses to ColV and Kα1T and up-regulation of profibrotic cytokines and growth factors.  This indicates complement activation is not necessary in the pathogenesis of chronic rejection following lung transplantation.

The team has laboratory results on 36 patients thus far. While positive class I (3%) or class II (0%) DSA pre-transplant were rare, significant numbers developed class I and class II DSA within [ADDRESS_939157]-transplant (Figure 2).    Autoantibodies to ColV and kα1T were detectable prior to transplant in 33% and 44% of subjects, respectively. Post-transplant, de novo DSA and autoantibodies to both self-antigens occurred frequently, with kα1T most common.  Correlations between antibodies and outcomes have not been assessed to date.  These results indicate both allo- and autoantibodies develop frequently and early following pediatric lung transplantation supporting our contention that induction therapy targeting B cells will be required to prevent and or eliminate these antibodies. We analyzed recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] T cells for reactivity to donor antigens (when donor tissue was available) and to ColV and kα1T as putative autoantigens.  We observed 9/26 (35%), 2/36 (6%) and 21/36 (58%) of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_692390]/or autoantigens (ColV and Kα1T) posttransplant, respectively.   To expand upon these techniques to test for IL-17 production (IL-17 has been associated with BOS in recent adult transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]25) with limited available cells from pediatric patients we developed a 2 color IFNg/IL-17 ELISPOT assay (Figure 3).   CTOTC-03 tested for respi[INVESTIGATOR_692391] a potential trigger for immune activation.

CTOT-C Confidential Page [ADDRESS_939160] on the development of BOS:  Since 2006, the Washington University adult lung program and the Mohanakumar lab instituted serial analysis for development of Abs to donor mismatched HLA during the post-transplant period. All adult LTxR had negative donor cross-matches. Of 116 patients serially analyzed, 65 developed DSA (56%), with [ADDRESS_939161] the hypothesis that antibodies contribute to late graft injury, the Mohanakumar group used IVIG (500 mg/kg x 6 monthly doses) and rituximab (375 mg/m2 x 1 dose) for desensitization. Of the 44 patients treated, 27 (61%) cleared the DSA, and 17 (39%) had persistent DSA. An additional 17 patients were treated with IVIG alone and 11 (65%) cleared the DSA.  More importantly, patient and graft survival was significantly better in successfully desensitized patients (Figure 4) providing strong correlative evidence that DSA participate in the development of allograft injury.78   A critical role for Abs to self-Ags in the pathogenesis of BOS:  Among adult LTxR who developed DSA (n=57) and subsequently cleared DSA following Ab directed therapy (n=34), [ADDRESS_939162] of these individuals, strongly implicating pathogenic roles for Abs to self-Ags. As shown in Figure 5, the LTxR who cleared both Abs to HLA and self-Ags demonstrated improved freedom from BOS in comparison to patients that cleared only DSA but not Abs to self Ags.  Taken together, these preliminary results strongly support our hypothesis that Abs to self–Ags play a critical role in the pathogenesis of BOS and our proposed study will assess both the impact of intervention and further determine significance and mechanisms of antibodies to self-antigens.  Successful post-transplant desensitization of Abs to self-Ags in adult LTxR:  To determine whether a post-transplant desensitization regimen for DSA with rituximab and IVIG has an impact on the Abs to self-Ags, we analyzed 123 LTxR who developed DSA.  Forty-five LTxR had Abs to kα1T and 31 had Abs to ColV prior to desensitization. Following treatment 46.7% of the kα1T+ and 48.4% of the ColV+ became negative and another 25% demonstrated a significant decrease. This study demonstrates that rituximab-based desensitization of Abs to self-Ags is feasible.  Figure 4: Improved survival following clearance of DSA.

We analyzed sera from three groups of patients: group I DSA and Abs to self-Ags present (prior to therapy), group II cleared DSA but Abs to self-Ags persisted and group III cleared both DSA and Abs to self-Ags. Results presented in Figure 6 demonstrate that group I patients who had both DSA and Abs to self-Ag (n= 23) as well as group II that cleared DSA but persisted Abs to self-Ag (n=9) had high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, group III cleared DSA and Abs to self-Ags (n=25) and did not develop BOS had decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (namely IL-1β (3.2 fold decrease), IL-17 (3.0), and IFN-γ (2.3)) and increased IL-10 (3.7 fold, p<0.01 for all) within 6 months. These results support persistent immune responses to self-Ags can lead to a pro-inflammatory milieu that can                                                               facilitate the development of BOS.   Increased frequency of B cell with autoimmune phenotype in BOS:  Data from mouse models and humans with autoimmune diseases suggest an important role for a specific subset of B cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases79-81.  These B cells express CD11c, produce autoantibodies and can be induced to proliferate in response to TLR stimuli.  To determine whether this subpopulation of B cells is increased in adult LTxR with BOS we determined the frequency of the autoimmune B cells (AIB) with phenotype of CD19+, CD11c+ B220+ in peripheral blood of LTxR with BOS and Abs to self-Ags. Results presented in Figure 7 demonstrate a five-fold increase in the AIB (9.6±2.8% of B cells) over normal (1.6±0.7% of B cells). To determine whether those B cells are present in the lung allografts, BAL cells were characterized. Results demonstrate that the BOS(+) LTxR who had Abs to self-Ag demonstrate a 3.5 fold increase over BOS(-) LTxR (9.3±2.1% vs. 2.8±1.2% of B cells, n=6). It is of interest that BOS(+) anti self-Ag(-) LTxR showed similarly low frequency of AIB as in BOS(-) LTxR (data not shown). These results strongly favor our contention that AIB may play a role in immune responses to self-Ags and development of BOS, which will be tested in the mechanistic study. Circulating B cells in BOS(+) LTxR augment the frequency of self-Ag specific Th17 cells: To determine the role of B cells to activate self-Ag specific T cells , T cells isolated from BOS(+) self-Ab(+) or BOS(-) self Ab(-) LTxR were cultured with sub-optimal concentrations of kα1T or ColV (100ng/ml) with or without B cells. At the end of 2 weeks, the frequency of Th17 cells was analyzed by [CONTACT_15236].

Mechanistic Endpoints The following mechanistic endpoints will be assessed: 1. Incidence and kinetics of DSA and autoantibodies, specifically Collagen V (ColV) and k-alpha-1 tubulin (kα1T); 2. Frequency, kinetics, phenotype and function of peripheral B cells;  3. Frequency, kinetics and cytokine profiles of allo- and auto reactive T cells; 4. Incidence and quantity of B cells and B cell proximity to other cells in the graft tissue. 3.5. Stratification, Randomization, and Blinding/Masking This is a double-blinded study; therefore, medication assignments will be blinded to the study participants as well as to the site clinical personnel.  Only the site research pharmacist will have access to the unblinded randomization schedule for that site.  In the event the subject undergoes a life-threatening reaction, then study subject and treating physician will be unblinded to the treatment assignment.  In the event the subject undergoes repeat severe infusion or hypersensitivity reactions, despi[INVESTIGATOR_301977], then study subject and treating physician will be unblinded to the treatment assignment.   IND safety reports will be reported to the FDA, DSMB, and IRBs in an unblinded fashion.

B Cell Induction in Pediatric Lung Transplantation                         Version 4.0-July 16, 2018   5. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Participants 5.1. Risks of rituximab (Rituxan®) No dose-limiting effects were observed in Phase I/II studies.  Reported adverse events including fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, asthenia, and hypotension, occurred primarily during rituximab infusions and typi[INVESTIGATOR_598329] a slower rate.   Fatal Infusion Reactions:  Severe and fatal cardiopulmonary events, including angioedema, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock, have been reported.  These severe reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_27803] 30-120 minutes. Cardiac Events:  Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, including arrhythmia and angina, have had recurrences of these cardiac events during rituximab infusions. Tumor Lysis Syndrome:  Tumor lysis syndrome, some with fatal outcome, has been reported and is characterized in patients with a high number of circulating malignant cells (≥25,000 ul) by [CONTACT_334230], renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Renal Events:  Rituximab has been associated with severe renal toxicity including acute renal failure requiring dialysis, and in some cases has led to death.  Renal toxicity has occurred in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (≥25,000/mm2) or high tumor burden who experience tumor lysis syndrome and in patients administered concomitant cisplatin.  Mucocutaneous Reactions:  Severe bullous skin reactions, including fatal cases of toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_223865], have been reported in patients treated with rituximab.  The onset of reaction has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following rituximab exposure. Nervous System:   a. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS):  Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported. Signs and symptoms include visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires confirmation by [CONTACT_14548]. The reported cases had recognized risk factors for PRES/RPLS, including hypertension, immunosuppressive therapy and/or other concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  b. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML):  PML is a rare disease caused by [CONTACT_223917].  Immunosuppression allows reactivation of the JC virus which causes demyelination and destruction of oligodendrocytes resulting in death or severe disability.  Rare cases of PML, some resulting in death, have been reported in patients with hematologic malignancies who have received rituximab.  The majority of these patients had received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  Cases of PML resulting in death have also been reported following the use of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The reported cases had multiple risk factors for PML, including the underlying disease and long-term immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy.  Most cases of PML were diagnosed within [ADDRESS_939174], brain MRI, and lumbar puncture should be considered as clinically indicated.  In patients who develop PML, rituximab should be discontinued and reductions or discontinuation of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should be considered. Hematologic Events:  In clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients treated with rituximab; these include: lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).  The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1 to 588 days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 to 116 days).  A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following Rituximab therapy were reported.  In addition, there have been a limited number of postmarketing reports of prolonged pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, and late onset neutropenia.  Infectious Events:  Rituxan® induced B cell depletion in 70% to 80% of patients with NHL and was associated with decreased serum immunoglobulins in a minority of patients; the lymphopenia lasted a median of 14 days (range, 1-588 days).  Infectious events occurred in 31% of patients: 19% of patients had bacterial infections, 10% had viral infections, 1% had fungal infections, and 6% were unknown infections.  Serious infectious events (Grade 3 or 4), including sepsis, occurred in 2% of patients. Hepatitis B Reactivation:  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported in some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab.  The majority of patients received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  The median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately four months after the initiation of rituximab and approximately one month after the last dose. Participants with pre-existing Hepatitis B infection will not be eligible to participate in this study. Other Serious Viral Infections:  The following additional serious viral infections, either new, reactivated or exacerbated, have been identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. The majority of patients received Rituxan® in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. These viral infections included JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]), cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C. In some cases, the viral infections occurred up to one year following discontinuation of Rituxan® and have resulted in death. Bowel Obstruction and Perforation:  Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some cases leading to death, were observed in patients receiving Rituxan® in combination with chemotherapy for DLBCL. In post-marketing reports, which include both patients with low-grade or follicular NHL and DLBCL, the mean time to onset of symptoms was 6 days (range 1−77) in patients with documented gastro-intestinal perforation. Complaints of abdominal pain, especially early in the course of treatment, should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment. Immunogenicity:  Patients may develop a human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) response with rituximab treatment.  The clinical significance of this is unclear. Pregnancy:  B cell lymphocytopenia generally lasting less than 6 months can occur in infants exposed to rituximab in utero.

B Cell Induction in Pediatric Lung Transplantation                         Version 4.0-July 16, 2018   Immunization:  Response rates may be reduced with non-live vaccines. Additional Safety Signals:  The following serious adverse events have been reported to occur in patients following completion of rituximab infusions: arthritis, disorders of blood vessels (vasculitis, serum sickness and lupus-like syndrome), eye disorders (uveitis and optic neuritis), lung disorders including pleuritis and scarring of the lung (bronchiolitis obliterans), that may result in fatal outcomes, and fatal cardiac failure. See the rituximab Investigator Brochure for additional details regarding safety experience with rituximab. 5.2. Risks of Immunosuppression Medications The safety and effectiveness of immunosuppression medications in pediatric patients is not established in controlled trials. However, the dose, efficacy and adverse event profile are not thought to be different from adults based on studies in the literature.  5.2.1 Thymoglobulin® [Anti-thymocyte globulin (rabbit)] Risks associated with Thymoglobulin® include immune-mediated reactions, infections, reactivation of infection, malaise, dizziness, sepsis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and increased incidence of malignancies, including lymphoma or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Occasional reactions are observed at the infusion site including pain, swelling and erythema. The majority of pediatric lung transplant centers reporting to the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) registry use antibody based induction immunosuppressive therapy. 5.2.2 CellCept® (Mycophenolate mofetil-MMF) CellCept® (Mycophenolate mofetil - MMF) is approved (in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids) as an immunosuppressive agent for renal, cardiac, and hepatic solid organ transplantation. Adverse events reported in > 30% of renal, cardiac or liver transplant patients receiving MMF were pain, fever, headache, asthenia, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, urinary tract infection, hypertension, hypotension, peripheral edema,  hypercholesteremia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, increased creatinine and BUN, cough, hypomagnesaemia, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], dyspnea, lung disorder, pleural effusion, tremor and insomnia.   There is an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_153201], particularly of the skin. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving MMF 1 - 1.5 mg BID. Severe neutropenia developed in up to 2% of renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_692396] 1.5 mg BID. MMF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, and pure red cell aplasia have been reported in patients treated with MMF. Gastrointestinal bleeding (requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) has been observed in approximately 3% of renal, in 1.7% of cardiac, and in 5.4% of hepatic transplant patients treated with MMF 1.5 g BID.   Use of CellCept® during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, and kidney.    Females of reproductive potential will receive contraceptive counseling and use acceptable birth control during the study, and for 6 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_588206]®, unless the participant chooses abstinence (she chooses to avoid heterosexual intercourse completely).   
CTOT-C Confidential Page 36 of 92 
B Cell Induction in Pediatric Lung Transplantation                         Version 4.0-July 16, 2018    For those females using CellCept® at any time during pregnancy and those becoming pregnant within 6 weeks of discontinuing therapy, the investigator or healthcare practitioner should report the pregnancy to the Mycophenolate Pregnancy Registry.  The investigator or healthcare practitioner should strongly encourage the patient to enroll in the pregnancy registry.  Risks and benefits of CellCept® should be discussed with the patient.  When appropriate, consider alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryofetal toxicity.  In certain situations, the patient and her healthcare practitioner may decide that the maternal benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus.  If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.  Additional information about MMF can be found in the package insert.  5.2.2 Prograf® (Tacrolimus) Side effects of Prograf® (Tacrolimus) include hypertension, glucose intolerance, peripheral neuropathy, renal insufficiency, abnormal liver function studies, seizures, nausea, vomiting, confusion, hypomagnesaemia, tremulousness, neurotoxicity, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), interstitial lung disease, BK nephropathy, and increased risk of secondary malignancies. Additional information about Tacrolimus can be found in the package insert. 5.3. Risks of Study Procedures  5.3.1 Risk of Blood Draw (Venipuncture)  The amount of blood that may be drawn from pediatric subjects for research purposes will not exceed 3cc/kg per day or 7cc/kg per six week period.  All blood samples for the mechanistic study will be obtained at the time of scheduled blood draws, so there will be minimal additional risk associated with obtaining the study samples.  The subject may experience some discomfort at the site of the needle entry, bruising, swelling, redness, fainting, or local infection. The additional amount of blood could contribute to the development of anemia.  The subject’s clinical condition will be taken into consideration to determine whether research blood tests can be performed. 5.3.2. Risk of Bronchoalveolar Lavage and Bronchoscopy Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be obtained during standard of care bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_692397].  The risks associated with BAL collected for this study are no different than routine management. 5.3.3. Risk of Tacrolimus Standard Deviation Threshold Non-adherence may be identified during the intervention.  If non-adherence is identified, this may negatively affect the participant’s candidacy for a second transplant.   The initial call for the intervention will be facilitated by [CONTACT_692473].  During this call the team at ICMMS will ask the participant or parent/guardian to provide contact [CONTACT_692474].  Any PHI shared with ISMMS may be disclosed.

B Cell Induction in Pediatric Lung Transplantation                         Version 4.0-July 16, 2018   6. Investigational Agent  6.1. Rituximab (Rituxan®) Rituximab is a is a genetically engineered, chimeric, murine/human monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant pre-B and mature B cells.  The antibody is an IgG1 κ immunoglobulin containing murine light-and heavy-chain variable region sequences and human constant region sequences.  Rituximab is composed of two heavy chains of 451 amino acids and two light chains of 213 amino acids (based on cDNA analaysis) and has an approximate molecular mass of 145 kD.  Rituximab has a binding affinity for the CD20 antigen of ~8.0 nM. 6.1.1. Rituximab (Rituxan®) [IP_ADDRESS]. Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling Rituximab® is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid concentrate for intravenous (IV) administration. Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in either 100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single-use vials. The products are formulated for intravenous administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, and Sterile Water for Injection. The pH is adjusted to 6.5.   The vials provided to the pharmacy will have occluded, study-specific investigational agent labels. [IP_ADDRESS]. Dosage and Preparation Rituximab will be given as an intravenous infusion.   2 Doses: 375 mg/m2 on Day 0 (within 12 hours of return to ICU following transplant) and Day 12 (+/- 2 days). Rituximab should be prepared using appropriate aseptic techniques. Withdraw the necessary amount of Rituximab or Rituximab Placebo and dilute to a final concentration of 1 to 4 mg/mL into an infusion bag containing either 0.9% Sodium Chloride, USP, or 5% Dextrose in Water, USP.  Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.  Rituximab or Rituximab Placebo should be given as a slow intravenous infusion.  It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.  Do not infuse rituximab concomitantly with another IV solution or other IV medications.  Rituximab infusions should be made through a dedicated line.  Participants will be premedicated using:  • Tylenol® (Acetaminophen), 15 mg/kg (to a maximum of 1 gram) should be administered (by [CONTACT_1966], enteral or rectal administration) 30 to 60 minutes prior to the start of an infusion; and  • Benadryl® (Diphenhydramine) by [CONTACT_1966] 30-60 minutes prior to the start of an infusion as described in Table 1 or by [CONTACT_24636] 1 mg/kg (to a maximum of 50 mg) 30 minutes prior to the start of an infusion.

Since transient hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medications 12 hours prior to rituximab infusion. [IP_ADDRESS]. Administration Guidelines First infusion (Day 0):  Rituximab should be administered within 12 hours of returning from the ICU following transplant, based on hemodynamic stability.  Rituximab should be administered intravenously through a dedicated line at an initial rate of 0.5 mg/kg/hr (to a maximum rate of 50 mg/hr) for the first hour.   If hypersensitivity or infusion-related events do not occur, the infusion rate will be escalated by 0.5 mg/kg/hr every 30 minutes, to a maximum rate of 400 mg/hr.   If a hypersensitivity or infusion-related reaction event develops, the infusion rate should be temporarily slowed or interrupted.  The infusion can continue at one-half the previous rate upon improvement of patient symptoms.  Subsequent Infusion (Day 12 +/- 2 days):  A second dose of rituximab will be administered to subjects considered stable enough to receive the infusion. Individual Subject Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: Individuals who meet any of the criteria listed below will not receive the second dose of rituximab. 1. Serious adverse event causally related to the rituximab infusion; 2. Acute pulmonary infectious process with evidence of graft dysfunction; 3. Positive blood culture, sepsis or other disease process with hemodynamic instability; 4. Renal insufficiency requiring hemodialysis or ultrafiltration; 5. Inability to obtain intraveneous access; 6. Use of an investigational drug after the first dose of placebo or rituximab; 7. Any other event which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_692362].  If the first infusion was well tolerated, the subsequent infusion may be administered intraveneously through a dedicated line at an initial rate of 1.0 mg/kg/hr (to a maximum rate of 100 mg/h) for the 
CTOT-C Confidential Page [ADDRESS_939175] hour.   If hypersensitivity or infusion-related events do not occur, the infusion rate will be escalated by 1.0 mg/kg/hr (maximum rate of 100 mg increase per hour) every 30 minutes, to a maximum rate of 400 mg/hr.  If hypersensitivity or infusion-related event develops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted.  The infusion can continue at one half the previous rate upon improvement of patient symptoms. If hypersensitivity or infusion-related events occurred during the first infusion, the subsequent infusion should be administered in the same manner as the first infusion.  6.1.2. Rituximab Placebo [IP_ADDRESS]. Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling Rituximab placebo is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid concentrate for intravenous (IV) administration. Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in either 100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single-use vials. The product is formulated for intravenous administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, and Sterile Water for Injection. The pH is adjusted to 6.5.  The vials provided to the pharmacy will have occluded, study-specific investigational agent labels. [IP_ADDRESS]. Dosage, Preparation, and Administration Rituxmab placebo will be administered according to the guidelines for rituximab outlined in section [IP_ADDRESS]. 6.2. Infusion Supervision (Rituximab and Rituximab Placebo) Rituximab and rituximab placebo should be administered in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692398].  Rituximab and rituximab placebo may be administered on an outpatient basis however patients may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25642].   The infusion will be supervised by [CONTACT_49885] (i.e., clinical nurse, physician) at the participating institutions.  A history of each infusion and any adverse side effects will be recorded and reported to the SACCC using the appropriate case report forms. Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) and standard laboratory testing (CBC, basic metabolic panel) will be obtained prior to the start of each rituximab or rituximab placebo infusion.  The local investigator will determine whether to hold the infusion due to lab abnormalities.  Vital signs will be monitored every [ADDRESS_939176] 1 hour following the infusion to enable the administration of drugs, if necessary.  Additional vital signs may be obtained as clinically indicated.  Fluid resuscitation will be provided as needed for changes in vital signs suggesting hydration would be beneficial.

Drug Accountability Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) the investigator will maintain adequate records of the disposition of the investigational agent, including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispensed (participant-by-participant accounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed. Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by [CONTACT_3452].  A drug-dispensing log will be kept current for each participant.  This log will contain the identification of each participant and the date and quantity of drug dispensed. All records regarding the disposition of the investigational product will be available for inspection. Any unused study drug (unopened or within expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]) may be returned to the manufacturer at the end of the study. 6.4. Toxicity Prevention and Management Patients enrolled in this study will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory tests before and during their participation in this study.  Safety evaluations will consist of medical interviews, recording of adverse events, physical examinations, blood pressure, and laboratory measurements.  Subjects will be evaluated for adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events requiring study drug interruption or discontinuation at each study visit for the duration of their participation in the study.   6.5. Modification or Premature Discontinuation of Investigational Agent Rituximab (Rituxan®) and Rituximab Placebo may be modified or prematurely discontinued for any participant for any of the following reasons: v General Infusion-Related Reactions.  If an infusion-related reaction develops, the infusion rate should be temporarily reduced or interrupted.  The infusion may be continued at one-half the previous rate upon improvement of the patient’s symptoms. v Life-Threatening Reaction.  In the event of a life-threatening reaction, the infusion should be discontinued and the patient should receive medical treatment.  Patients who experience a life-threatening reaction will not receive additional Rituximab/Placebo, and will remain in the study, and be included in the ITT analysis. The study treatment assignment will be unblinded to the site personnel and the study participant. (Protocol section 3.5.1) v Severe Infusion Reaction.  The infusion should be interrupted for severe reactions, and supportive care measures should be instituted as medically indicated (e.g., IV fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen). The infusion should not be restarted until all the symptoms have disappeared.  On the restarting of the infusion, the rate should be half of that which precipi[INVESTIGATOR_692399]. Patients who experience repeat severe infusion reactions, despi[INVESTIGATOR_301977], will not receive additional Rituximab/Placebo, and will remain in the study, and be included in the ITT analysis.

Hypersensitivity reactions (non-IgE-mediated reactions) may respond to adjustments in the infusion rate and in medical management.  The infusion should be interrupted for severe hypersensitivity reactions and can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 100 mg/hr to 50 mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved.  Treatment of these symptoms with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen (or their equivalents) is recommended; additional treatment with bronchodilators or IV saline may be indicated.

The following caveats to the grading scheme will be used.   • Absence of infiltrates on chest radiograph is Grade 0, even if PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 300.  • If the subject is on nasal cannula for oxygen of FiO2 < 0.3, the subject is graded as [ADDRESS_939186] radiograph.   • Any subject on extracorporeal oxygenation is Grade 3.   • Any subject mechanically ventilated with FiO2 > 0.[ADDRESS_939187] (FDA 1572) will conduct a face-to-face meeting with the study candidate to review all required elements of informed consent.  The potential study participant and/or parent/guardian will sign an informed consent form before undergoing any screening study procedures. Age of assent will be determined locally.  Once the informed consent process is complete, the participant is considered enrolled in the study. All enrolled participants will be assigned a unique participant number and their disposition must be accounted for at the end of the study. 8.2. Screening/Baseline Visit At the time of listing, potential participants will be entered on a site specific screening log.  Age at listing, diagnosis and reason the patient was not enrolled into the study, if applicable, will be captured on the screening log.  If the patient and/or parent(s)/guardian(s) are in agreement to participate in the study then the informed consent document should be obtained while the participant is on the wait list.    During the screening period study personnel will review the subject’s medical record for previous and current medical history, perform a physical examination, and record the subject’s demographic information (age, gender, and race).  Blood specimens will be obtained for screening and mechanistic studies as specified in Appendix 1.  Pre-transplant blood may be collected up to [ADDRESS_939188] be recollected every 60 days until the transplant occurs. The baseline visit will occur at the time of transplant.  During the baseline visit, donor demographics (age, gender, and race), cause of death, HLA, Blood Type, serum creatinine, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein - Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV information will be collected.  8.3.

All events will be reported using a designated electronic case report form (eCRF). Chronic allograft dysfunction, relisting for transplant and death data will be collected up to [ADDRESS_939191] and interpretations recorded on electronic case report forms (eCRFs).    Tacrolimus Standard Deviation Marker Variability of tacrolimus will be monitored continuously starting [ADDRESS_939192] deviation (SD) of tacrolimus levels.[ADDRESS_939193]-transplant will be used.  In order to ensure the validity of tacrolimus trough levels, clinical sites will agree on quality control measures for obtaining trough levels.  A rolling SD will be calculated for every patient using 1-year of tacrolimus levels (at least 3 trough levels).  A SD of 2.0 or more (Shemesh et al. manuscript in preparation), an undetectable level or the absence of a tacrolimus trough level for 3 months will trigger a phone call among the site coordinator, the participant, parent(s)/guardian(s) and trained personnel at ISMMS to address barriers to adherence.   Individuals who meet the criteria listed below will not participate in the phone calls for the tacrolimus standard deviation marker:  1. Inpatient status  2. Any condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may impact the quality or interpretation of the data obtained from the intervention. The frequency of the calls is described in the table below.

The team at the call center will determine when the participant will return to the schema outlined in Table 10. With the consent of the participant, information obtained during the intervention will be shared with the participant’s parent(s)/guardian(s) and clinical team. Neurological Assessment All participants who receive at least 1 dose of Rituximab (Rituxan®) or placebo will undergo a screening neurological exam at the time points specified in Appendix 1. Subjects who have objective findings will be evaluated by [CONTACT_692479]. 8.5.

Only the research pharmacist will receive a communication identifying the treatment assignment. 8.7.2. Blinding This is a double-blinded study; therefore, medication assignments will be blinded to the study participants as well as to the site clinical personnel.  Only the site research pharmacist will have access to the unblinded randomization schedule for that site.  In the event that the subject undergoes a life-threatening infusion reaction, then the study subject and the treating physician will be unblinded to treatment assignment.  Safety events that do not occur during an infusion of the study drug, but that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_692408].   IND safety reports will be reported to the FDA, DSMB, and IRBs in an unblinded fashion. 8.7.3. Unblinding Authorization Emergency unblinding of a participant for safety purposes is to be handled through the site Investigators, the medical monitor, and the site pharmacist.  Whenever possible the medical monitor should be notified prior to and involved in the decision to unblind.  In all cases, including when the medical monitor is not notified prior to the decision to unblind, prompt notification and reporting is required.  Except in the case of a life threatening infusion reaction, a request to unblind a study subject should be based on the belief that knowledge of the treatment assignment is necessary in order to treat the patient appropriately.  In the case of a life-threatening infusion reaction every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_692480], however ultimately the site Investigator must act in the study subject’s best interest.  8.7.4. Reporting Unblinding Events Any unblinding event will require a full report on the Study Treatment Unblinding eCRF.  The information captured on the eCRF will include 1) a brief description of the medical events which led to the decision to unblind, 2) whether the NIAID medical monitor was notified 3) the date and time of unblinding, and 4) the reason for unblinding the subject.  If the unblinding occurred in a situation other than the infusion of the study drug, the eCRF should include how knowledge of the treatment assignment was expected to influence therapeutic decisions.  All unblinding information will be reported to the DSMB and will be included in the final study report to the FDA. During site visits, the site monitor must verify that the medical monitor of the trial was notified and that a written account (described above) was completed.    
CTOT-C Confidential Page [ADDRESS_939196]. Louis, MO (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_692409], MD) 9.1.1. Antibodies to Mismatched Donor HLA We will measure serum anti-HLA antibodies using standardized reagents and protocols developed within the CTOTC/CTOT consortium.85 [CONTACT_557402]’s laboratory will function as the core lab for this work and has been an integral participant in the cross validation studies performed by [CONTACT_97677].  Serum will be screened by [CONTACT_692481] (PRA) and if positive, tested for reactivity to single antigen beads.  We will also perform flow crossmatch testing using donor cells as targets.  This latter approach is important because it will permit us to assess whether there are donor reactive antibodies that are undetected by [CONTACT_692482].  Such antibodies may react to HLA molecules which may be under represented in the beads (e.g. some of the HLA C alleles, or DP, DQ alleles) or may react with non-HLA antigens.  As part of the mechanistic analysis, we will determine whether donor specific antibodies (DSA) are complement fixing using complement dependent lymphocytotoxicity assay against the donor cells86   We will perform analyses/correlations with outcome using any alloantibody, donor specific alloantibody and either class I reactivity or class II reactivity as test variables.  All assays are standard in the Mohanakumar lab and have been adapted to conform with CTOT/CTOTC mechanistic studies procedures.

If we find that the autoantibody containing serum specifically induces epi[INVESTIGATOR_692416], we will isolate the autoreactive fraction of the IgG using (for example) kα1T conjugated beads and repeat the assays. 9.3. Molecular Immunology Studies The Molecular Immunology Core Laboratory is located at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in [LOCATION_001], NY (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_692417], MD). RNA obtained from peripheral blood collection in PAXgene RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX, a Qiagen/BD Company) will be used for both mRNA Profiling/Gene Expression (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_692417], MD) and IgG VDJ Region studies (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_692418], MD).  The Molecular Core Laboratory will isolate the RNA and aliquot a portion for both studies.  9.3.1. Gene Expression Profiles, mRNA Profiling in Blood and the Bronchoalveolar Lavage RNA will be stored at the Heeger laboratory and used for gene expression studies (RNA, miRNA).  We will assess the transcriptional profile associated with rituximab based immunosuppression using array technology.

The PBMCs will be used to perform T-Cell Function assays (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_692417], MD) and the plasma will be shipped to the Washington University in St. Louis (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_692409], MD) and used for humoral immunology assays.   For T-cell autoreactivity, PBMCs collected longitudinally immediately prior to transplant, and then post-transplantation and will be tested for their reactivity against self-antigens collagen V, Kα1Tand col IV as control. (All of these proteins are available as reported above and are endotoxin free).  Because cellular immunity to autoantigens is anticipated to be relatively low frequency, we will use the highly sensitive cytokine ELISPOT as an initial approach for detection and enumeration of frequency of cells secreting specific cytokines following stimulation with various self-antigens described above.  We have the ability to perform 2 color IFNg/IL17 ELISPOT assays for autoantigen reactivity, which will permit us to maximize our ability to obtain information from small amounts of blood (Figure 3 above).

Using these published methods multicolor IF staining for B cells (CD20), T-cells (CD4, CD8), Treg (CD4, foxp3), and macrophages (CD68) will be performed on representative histology slides.  Computer assisted image analysis will be used to determine the numbers of each cell type within the area being studied and to assess correlations among cell subsets. Examples demonstrating feasibility are shown in Figure 11.         Results will be correlated with the graded score of the biopsy, the presence or absence of AMR features (capi[INVESTIGATOR_53076], C4d capi[INVESTIGATOR_692426]) and outcome, including effects of treatment for acute rejection and the long term development of BOS. 9.6.

Biospecimen Storage and Future Use Biological specimens obtained under this protocol may be used in future assays to reevaluate biological responses as additional research tests are developed over time. These specimens will be collected at time points already scheduled for the core mechanistic studies outlined in the Schedule of Events (Appendices 1 and 2), in order to allow specimens to be stored for use in new assays that have yet to be optimized or conceived, or assays performed by [CONTACT_692494]-C  members for cross-validation studies.  Appropriate informed consent will be obtained for both the collection and storing of samples.  The specimens from these evaluations may be stored beyond the funding period. During the funding period, samples will be identifiable, which means samples will be coded with a subject ID number that could be directly linked to the subject and the subject’s medical record. When the funding period is over, samples will be anonymized, which means a sample that was previously identifiable, has had all identifiers removed and can no longer be linked back to the subject or the subject’s medical record by [CONTACT_61076]. Study participants will be informed that they may be approached about additional clinical evaluations or studies that have received the full approval of the NIAID as new evaluations are identified.  If additional evaluations are determined to be desirable, this protocol (and other appropriate study documents, e.g., the informed consent and the statistical analysis plan) will be amended and submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities, ethics committees, and IRBs for approval.  Each participant’s signature [CONTACT_692512].  The specimens from these evaluations may be stored up to the end of the grant— approximately 5 years, or longer if the grant is extended.

Appropriate notifications will also be made to site principal investigators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and health authorities.  Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, ICH Guideline E-6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, 21CFR Parts 312 and 320, and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html. 12.2 Definitions 12.2.1 Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research (modified from the definition of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on Harmonization E-6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice) (from OHRP "Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and Adverse Events (1/15/07)" http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2)  For this study, an adverse event will include any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with:   • Study therapy regimen: Rituximab or Rituximab Placebo • Study mandated procedures:  o Bronchoscopy:  Any AE occurring within 24 hours after a study related bronchoscopy. o Blood Draw:  Any AE occurring within 24 hours after a study related blood draw. [IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational drug [or investigational study therapy regimen] caused the adverse event. For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)). 12.2.2 Unexpected Adverse Event  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or package insert or is not listed at the specificity, severity or rate of occurrence that has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the IND.

B Cell Induction in Pediatric Lung Transplantation                         Version 4.0-July 16, 2018   “Unexpected” also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Investigator Brochure or package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation (21 CFR 312.32(a)] 12.2.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or DAIT/NIAID, it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)): 1. Death. 2. A life-threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or DAIT/NIAID, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. 5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. The NIAID medical monitor will review each SAE and assess the relationship of the event to the study procedure.  Events meeting serious criteria that occur outside of these parameters should also be reported if the investigator deems a possible association with a protocol mandated procedure.  Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_453541]. 12.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events 12.3.1 Grading Criteria The study site will grade the severity of adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_692495]’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.   This document (referred to herein as the NCI-CTCAE manual) provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events. The NCI-CTCAE has been reviewed by [CONTACT_692496] [INVESTIGATOR_692431].    
CTOT-C Confidential Page 64 of 92 
B Cell Induction in Pediatric Lung Transplantation                         Version 4.0-July 16, 2018   Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the NCI-CTCAE manual: Grade 1 = mild adverse event. Grade 2 = moderate adverse event. Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event. Grade 4 = life-threatening or disabling adverse event.  Grade 5 = death. Events grade [ADDRESS_939208] rituximab infusion will be collected and reported to the sponsor.  Outside of this period, hematologic cytopenias meeting grade 3 and higher will be collected and reported to the sponsor.   For grading an abnormal value or result of a clinical or laboratory evaluation (including, but not limited to, a radiograph, an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram etc.), a treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as an increase in grade from baseline or from the last post-baseline value that doesn’t meet grading criteria. Changes in grade from screening to baseline will also be recorded as adverse events, but are not treatment-emergent. If a specific event or result from a given clinical or laboratory evaluation is not included in the NCI-CTCAE manual, then an abnormal result would be considered an adverse event if changes in therapy or monitoring are implemented as a result of the event/result. 12.3.2 Attribution Definitions The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study therapy regimen or study procedure(s) will initially be determined by [CONTACT_623002]/SAE eCRF.  Final determination of attribution for safety reporting will be determined by [CONTACT_73884]/NIAID.  The relationship of an adverse event to study therapy regimen or procedures will be determined using the descriptors and definitions provided in Table 14.

Timely reporting of adverse events is required by 21 CFR and ICH E6 guidelines.  Site investigators will report all serious adverse events (see Section 12.2.3, Serious Adverse Event), regardless of relationship or expectedness within 24 hours of discovering the event. For serious adverse events, all requested information on the AE/SAE eCRF will be provided.  However, unavailable details of the event will not delay submission of the known information.  As additional details become available, the AE/SAE eCRF will be updated and submitted. 12.5.2 Reporting to Health Authority After an adverse event requiring 24 hour reporting (per Section 12.5.1, Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Sponsor) is submitted by [CONTACT_692497]/NIAID, there are two options for DAIT/NIAID to report the adverse event to the appropriate health authorities:

Note that all adverse events (not just those requiring 24-hour reporting) will be reported in the Annual IND Report. [IP_ADDRESS] Expedited Safety Reporting  This option, with 2 possible categories, applies if the adverse event is classified as one of the following: Category 1:  Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction [S[LOCATION_003]R] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS], Suspected Adverse Reaction and Section 12.2, Unexpected Adverse Event and 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)i).  The sponsor shall report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  The sponsor shall report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event, such as: 1. A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); 2. One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture); 3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  Category 2: Any findings from studies that suggests a significant human risk   The sponsor shall report any findings from other epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], analyses of adverse events within the current study or pooled analysis across clinical studies or animal or in vitro testing (e.g. mutagenicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity) that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug that would result in a safety-related change in the protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure or package insert or other aspects of the overall conduct of the study.   DAIT/NIAID shall notify the FDA and all participating investigators of expedited Safety Reports within 15 calendar days; unexpected fatal or immediately life-threatening suspected adverse reaction(s) shall be reported as soon as possible or within 7 calendar days.

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Temporary Suspension of enrollment and drug dosing for ad hoc DSMB Safety Review  A temporary halt in enrollment, randomization and administration of rituximab/rituximab placebo will be implemented if an ad hoc DSMB safety review is required.  In the event a study participant has already received the first dose of rituximab/rituximab placebo, every attempt will be made to expedite review such that a prompt decision can be made regarding the appropriate management for these subjects.

All randomized subjects who receive at least a portion of the initial rituximab/placebo infusion will constitute the ITT sample.  This sample will be used for evaluation of the primary and secondary clinical endpoints. Subjects will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomized, regardless of compliance with the protocol or withdrawal from the study. Per-Protocol (PP) Sample. Subjects from the ITT sample who complete the full induction protocol, with complete administration of the prescribed dose at both the initial and subsequent infusions, will make up the PP sample. This sample will capture subjects who both tolerate rituximab well and recover as expected from their transplant. Safety Sample.  All subjects from the ITT sample will constitute the safety sample. 13.4.2 Primary Analysis of Primary Endpoints /Outcomes We will use competing-risks Cox proportional hazards models to compare treatment groups on the time to endpoint, right-censored at the end of the two-year follow-up period or at time of loss to follow-up. This model, as opposed to a time-to-first-event model, will allow us to estimate a separate hazard function for each type of outcome as well as the overall outcome, and thus assess whether the effect of rituximab is the same for all outcome types100. Our focus will be on the estimates of these hazard ratios (HR) and their two-sided 90% confidence intervals, with HR < [ADDRESS_939216] one epi[INVESTIGATOR_692443]-sided 90% confidence interval. The absolute risk difference with 90% confidence interval will also be estimated. These methods assume no, or very low rates of, death and re-transplant in the study period. However, if meaningful numbers of subjects have these outcomes, the risk ratio for each incidence endpoint can be estimated through a Cox proportional hazards model with the incidence endpoint as the outcome and right-censoring at death, re-transplant, or other loss to follow-up, following the modeling process described above for the primary endpoint. Among subjects who are identified as qualifying for and agreeing to participate in the TVI, we will compare the rituximab and control groups on change in standard deviation of tacrolimus levels following the TVI (described in sections 5.3.3 and 8.4) using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, in which the standard deviation of tacrolimus levels following intervention is the outcome, and study group and pre-intervention standard deviation of tacrolimus levels are the predictors. The group effect with its 90% confidence interval will be estimated. For safety outcomes, we will analyze each type of infection separately (bacterial, fungal, or viral, including RVI, CMV, and EBV), as well as for all types of infections combined. We will first determine the incidence of bacterial, fungal and viral infections in the rituximab and control groups. ‘Incidence rate’ will be the number of infections per patient-month, and we will focus on the estimates and associated 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of such rates (RR), where RR > 1.[ADDRESS_939217] independence of events, greater proportions of patients will experience more epi[INVESTIGATOR_692444]. Accordingly, a Poisson regression models offset for months of follow-up and adjusted for overdispersion will be used to compare groups on the rate of each type of infection and any infection.  Serious adverse events related to rituximab will be reported by [CONTACT_692502] 90% confidence intervals.  Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], with 90% confidence intervals. 13.4.5 Analyses of Exploratory Endpoints We will correlate pre and/or post-transplant serum reactivity to each autoantigen and to donor HLA with our primary endpoint to prospectively and independently test the hypothesis that autoantibodies can be used as predictors of incipi[INVESTIGATOR_692445]. We will also correlate the presence of serum antibodies with positive C4d staining of the graft tissue (to be collected as part of the clinical component of the study).  To test the hypothesis that rituximab prevents induction of de novo autoantibodies and or DSA, we will compare titers of autoantibodies (or DSA) between the rituximab and control groups. Development of antibodies to either DSA or self-antigens or both and the kinetics of antibody development (time course following transplantation) will be correlated with clinical evidence of AMR and BOS as determined in the 
CTOT-C Confidential Page 75 of 92 
B Cell Induction in Pediatric Lung Transplantation                         Version 4.0-July 16, 2018   clinical part of study described above and the ISHLT criterion. While the absolute numbers of patients in each group with preexisting autoantibodies or DSA is anticipated to be small (thus limiting power) we will compare and report pre vs post-transplant titers in each case to determine if rituximab impacts preexisting antibody.  The results will be analyzed for development of PGD, development of DSA, diagnosis of AMR and BOS. In addition we will also determine any correlation which may exist between the strength of antibodies detected for DSA, HLA and each antibody to self-antigens either alone or cumulatively and clinical outcomes such as PGD, AMR and BOS.  We will analyze DSA and each type of antibody separately. The DSA and autoantibody data will consist of binary (positive/negative) or ordinal (negative/weak positive/strong positive) responses measured repeatedly at scheduled and unequally-spaced intervals. With these features of the data and at this sample size, it may not be feasible to obtain estimates of treatment effect at each time-point using a single statistical model with rituximab and time main effects and their interaction as covariates. Therefore we will describe the treatment effect over the course of the follow-up period.   The hazard ratio for the association between development of antibodies and clinical outcomes (the endpoint and its components, and the secondary incidence endpoints) will be estimated with its 90% confidence interval using a Cox proportional hazard model with presence or absence of antibodies as time-dependent repeated measures covariates, stratified by [CONTACT_1570]. We will model the association of each antibody on each outcome separately and in combination.  We will also estimate odds ratios with 90% confidence intervals for the associations between each of the various serum antibodies and C4d staining of the graft tissue. We will estimate these odds ratios at each time point between each pair of antibodies and each antibody and C4d result, both cross-sectional, and cumulative, in which case we would treat any subject with a current or prior positive result as positive for that particular antibody.

However, as described in section 12.8.2., the DAIT Transplant DSMB will periodically review safety data in open and/or closed sessions. 13.6 Sample Size Considerations  Planning this study indicates a sample-size analysis that is congruent with our focus on estimates and confidence intervals. Accordingly, simulated study data using a Weibull distribution with parameters chosen to match our expectation that the outcome rate in the control group will be 74% at one year and 53% at two years, with hazard ratios of 0.[ADDRESS_939219] size is reasonable.  Sample-sizes between N = 25 + 25 and N = 30+ 30 are feasible, as argued elsewhere. We also looked at N = 35 + 35, but acknowledge this probably not obtainable.  5000 individual trials were run for each combination of total sample size (N = 50, 60, 70) and true hazard ratio (0.40, 0.33). Each trial’s dataset was analyzed using a standard Cox proportional hazards model and the estimated log (HR) and its standard error were obtained. Using the criteria given in Table 21, each trial’s estimate and upper confidence limit was rated as being “excellent,” “good,” “fair,” or “lacking” in supporting the rituximab efficacy. The obtained proportions are given in Table 22. Table 21: Criteria for Estimating Upper Confidence Limit Evidence for Efficacy  Estimated Hazard Ratio  Upper 90% Confidence Limit  “Excellent”  <0.55  <0.85  “Good”  <0.60  0.85 – 1.10  “Fair”  <0.70  1.10 – 1.20  “Lacking”  Any  >1.20   Table 22: Upper 90% Confidence Limits by [CONTACT_692503] 25[PHONE_14400][PHONE_14401]+[ADDRESS_939220] Ratio 0.04 0.33 0.04 0.33 0.04 0.33 Evidence for Efficacy      “Excellent” 0.39 0.50 0.46 0.59 0.51 0.64 “Good” 0.22 0.21 0.23 0.21 0.24 0.20 “Fair” 0.07 0.06 0.06 0.05 0.06 0.04 “Lacking” 0.[ADDRESS_939221] indicates that 25 subjects in each group will provide greater than 80% power to detect a HR of 0.[ADDRESS_939222] information, visits consultations, examinations and other information are recorded.

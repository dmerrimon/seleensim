PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Title:  A Phase 1/2 Study of the Combination of Indoximod and 
Temozolomide for Adult Patients with Temozolomide -Refractory 
Primary Malignant Brain  Tumors  
 
Primary Objective : 
Phase  1 To determine the recommended phase 2 doses of indoximod and 
temozolomide in combination for treatment of progressive high - 
grade glioma (including glioblastoma multiforme) or  gliosarcoma  
 
Phase  2 To evaluate efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_173265] -month progression -free 
survival (PFS) of indoximod plus temozolomide (with or without 
bevacizumab or stereotactic radiation therapy SRS) in patients with 
progressive glioblastoma multiforme  (GBM)  
 
Population : Adult patients (16 years and older) with histologically  proven  
intracranial glioblastoma or gliosarcoma (phase 2) or any high -grade 
glioma (phase 1). There must be imaging confirmation of tumor 
progression or regrowth. Patients must have completed a course  of 
radiation therapy and at least 2 adjuvant cycles of temozolomide (phase 
2). 
Sample Size : 
 
Phase  1: 12-18 subjects (depending on dose  escalation)  
 
Phase  2: Up to 132  subjects  
Cohort 2a: 68 subjects who will receive indoximod with 
temozolomide (for those  that are naïve to bevacizumab)  
Cohort 2b: 24 subjects who will receive indoximod with 
temozolomide and bevacizumab in patients currently receiving or 
having previously received and failed bevacizumab  
Cohort 2c: 40 subjects who will receive indoximod with 
temozolomide and stereotactic radiosurgery  
 
Investigational  Drug : Indoximod (1 -methyl -D-tryptophan, D -1MT)  
 
Dosage/Treatment:  
 
Phase  1: Table below summarizes dose levels of indoximod and 
temozolomide for the Phase 1 portion of the  study.  
 
Dose Level  Indoximod DOSE (oral)  Temozolomide Dose (oral)  
1 600 mg BID x 28 days  150 mg/m2 x 5 days  
2 1000 mg BID x 28 days  150 mg/m2 x 5 days

This protocol will be conducted in the adult population and children age 16 years or older. A 
companion study for a pediatric population (brain tumors) will be opened after the completion of 
the Phase 1 portion of this study.   
 
 
 
Phase 2:  During Phase 2 portion of study, Indoximod will be administered 
at RP2D. The dose of indoximod will be determined in the phase 1 
portion of the  trial. 
 
Patients  will be separated  into three  different  cohorts,  based  on their 
prior therapy (bevacizumab -naïve  or bevacizumab -failure) and 
current potential indication for stereotactic  re-irradiation.  
Cohort 2a: Indoximod with temozolomide (for patients naïve to 
bevacizumab)  
Cohort 2b: Indoximod with temozolomide and bevacizumab (for 
patients currently receiving o r having previously received and 
failed bevacizumab)  
Cohort 2c: Indoximod with temozolomide and stereotactic 
radiosurgery

Recently, bevacizuinab has been approved os a standard thelapy foi ieciuient GBM based on 
single arm oi iandoinized phase 2 sttidies. Cun’ent clinical practice varies, tailored to individiml 
patients, so not all patients receive bevacizuinab. In the ciurent study, patients who me akeady 
receiving bevaciziunab and hove progressed on theiapy will not stop bevacizuiuob.  
 
Key cellular and molecular immune system mediators in the context of bi‘ain tumors have been 
identified end include TGF -§, cytotoxic T cells, T1’egs, CTLA -4, PD - I and IDO. New and 
promising inununotheropeiitic drugs as well as conibinotoriol strategies that focus on the 
simultaneous  inhibition  of inununosuppi’essive  checkpoints,  both in innnune  and brain  tulnor  cells: 
will open new avenues fo1 the ti’eatment of hiph grade  glio s.  
 
In this study, we will conduct o phose 1/2 trial in recurrent (teinozoloinide resistant) glionia 
patients.  The overall  poal of this study  is to provide  a foimdation for  fittue  sttidies  with indoximod 
tested in newly diagnosed glioblostoma patients with iadiotion and telnozolomide, or in 
combination with vaccine  theiapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
2.2 Indoximod l -Methyl -D-tryptophan,  hSC  
IND 
 
 
Indoximod  was developed  to inhibit  the indoleomine  2, 3 dioxygenase  (IDO)  enzymatic  pathway, 
which is important in the natural ie ilotion of immune responses. This potent immune 
suppi’essive mechanism hos been implicated in preserving tissue allografts, most dramatically in 
preventing T cell-mediated iejection of pateioally -derived fetal silo-antigens in pregnancy  2. IDO 
also repulotes iininime responses in infection, autoiininime syndromes, and malignant states 
(reviewed in ref 3)3. Indoximod inhibits the IDO pathway end inipi’oves onti -tiunor T cell 
responses,   slowin g  the  m’owt h  of  tuino’i s4 ’.  This  IDO-pathway   inhibito r  wcs  subsequently 
developed for clinical rise via NCI’s RAID program md is currently on the list of priority agents 
for continued development by [CONTACT_630195] (CTEP) 6. Initial work 
showed that the D -enantiom er was more effective in shrinking hunols than either the L - 

NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/2015

enantiomer or the racemic mixture. Indoximod has very good oral bioavailability and favorable 
pharmacokinetics with twice daily dosing. In addition, the drug was well tolerated in preclinical 
animal studies.  
 
Phase 1 trials of indoximod (IND#[ZIP_CODE] and #781 89) have been conducted and enrolled [ADDRESS_840588],  colon,  melanoma,  sarcoma,  pancreatic, 
and lung cancer.  The maximum  dose of indoximod  administered  was 2000  mg PO BID given  for 
28 day cycles. No maximum tolerated dose was established because the drug demonstrated good 
tolerability. Five patients achieved prolonged stabilization of their disease (longer than six 
months), and other patients experienced mixed responses during th e trial. No objective  responses 
were achieved by [CONTACT_630196]. Three patients, who had been previously treated with 
experimental immunotherapy, experienced autoimmune hypophysitis when started at the lowest 
dose level of indoximod. Subsequently, s imilar patients were excluded from the study, and no 
additional cases of hypophysitis were documented. Correlative studies showed elevations in 
serum  C-reactive  protein  levels  and tumor -specific  autoantibodies.  In conclusion,  indoximod  was 
well tolerated, showed biological activity, and had modest anti -tumor activity as  monotherapy.  
 
2.3 Temozolomide  (Temodar®) 
 
Temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent with good penetration of the central nervous system, has 
been evaluated in patients with glial malignancies. Ini tial studies evaluated the efficacy of 
temozolomide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and anaplastic glioma. A large,  randomized 
phase 2 study by [CONTACT_630197]7 treated patients with recurrent glioblastoma with either 
temozolomide (200 mg/m2 da ys 1-5 of a 28 -day cycle) or procarbazine (150 mg/m2 28 day - on, 
28-day off schedule). The study demonstrated only a modest objective response rate for both 
regimens (approximately 5%), but a superior 6 -month progression -free survival rate for 
temozolomide  (21% vs. 9%) was  found.  
 
In a phase 3 trial performed by [CONTACT_295524], patients with newly diagnosed 
glioblastoma  were  randomized  to receive  either  radiation  therapy  alone  or concurrent  radiation  and 
temozolomide followed by 6 months of adjuvant temozolomide8. The study demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in median survival for the combination treatment arm (12.1 
vs. 14.6 months) as well as a significant increase in 2 -year survival  (10% vs. 26%). This chemo - 
radiation regimen has been widely accepted as the new standard of care for patients with newly 
diagnosed glioblastoma. However, Temozolomide has demonstrated limited efficacy in recurrent 
glioma patients who previously have rece ived adjuvant therapy with  temozolomide9. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_840589] of care for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has not been clearly 
established. GBMs are highly vascularized brain tumors and growth has been shown to be 
angiogenesis dep endent, thus stimulating interest in developi[INVESTIGATOR_630151].  
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/[ADDRESS_840590]  not substantially  changed  overall  survival.  The development  of targeted  therapy  based 
on tumor vascular blockade led to the approval of bevacizumab for  recurrent or progressive 
glioblastoma,  since  it was proven  that this offers  a new opportunity  for patients  suffering  from  this 
malignancy. Bevacizumab is a recombinant antivascular monoclonal antibody binding to 
circulating Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) preventing this cytokine from reaching 
its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on endothelium. This results  in an inhi bition of endothelial 
cell proliferation  and vessel  sprouting.  In addition  to its role as a regulator  of angiogenesis,  VEGF 
has been found to mediate immunosuppression. VEGF impairs maturation of dendritic cells, 
resulting in diminished antigen -presenting function, but also suppresses T cell function through a 
number of proposed mechanisms10. In vivo, inhibition of VEGF after the administration of 
bevacizumab with adoptive cell transfer results in a significant infiltration of T cells, presumably 
due to nor malization of tumor vasculature, as well as significant tumor growth  inhibition11. 
 
Recent  intriguing  data have  been  obtained  by [CONTACT_630198][INVESTIGATOR_630152] (EGFRvIII) peptide, reproducing a specific epi[INVESTIGATOR_630153].  
 
Survival in patients with recurrent GBM is poor regardless of which treatment strategy is 
employed. Median progression free survival is 2.[ADDRESS_840591] chemotherapy regimens. 
Indoximod is a potent an d selective inhibitor of IDO in phase 1/2 development in solid tumors. 
Temozolomide is FDA approved for the treatment of front line and recurrent glioblastoma and 
forms  the basis  for the combination  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_630154].  Development  of a well-tolerated  and active 
combination of these two drugs has the potential for further improvement in the treatment of 
refractory GBM. Substantial preclinical data support using this  combination.  
 
Indoximod (1 -Methyl -D-Tryptophan) synergizes with a number of different chemother apy drugs 
in multiple tumor models4, 5. Recent animal studies conducted at GRU Cancer Center in [CONTACT_630279]’s  laboratory  suggest  a survival  benefit  in mice  with glial tumors  using  either  D- 
1MT or DL -1MT in combination with a standard treatment platform of alkylator chemotherapy 
(cyclophosphamide or temozolomide) plus radiation. These studies also suggest enhanced 
inflammatory effects (intratumoral complement activation) when 1MT is added to chemotherapy 
(temozolomide)  or chemo -radiation  treatments.  In addition,  widespread  target  IDO expression  has 
been documented in both the glioma tumor cells and in surrounding host astrocytes using this 
model13. In other  studies,  a low-dose metronomic  TMZ regimen  reduced  the number  of circulating 
Tregs in vivo14.

IDO as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma:  
IDO is expressed by [CONTACT_630199] a large proportion (50 -90%) of primary glioblastoma biopsy 
samples15 (and unpublished data, Johnson and Munn). In human glioma patients, IDO expression 
appears to be an independent prognostic factor, as its upregulation is associated with poor 
prognosis16. In addition, Wainwright et al have recently used an in vivo mouse g lioma model 
(GL261)  to demonstrate  the critical  role of IDO in promoting  GBM  survival  and progression16. In 
this study they also showed the importance of IDO in recruiting regulatory T cells into brains of 
tumor -bearing mice16. Thus, in this preclinical mo del, the IDO -pathway appears to play a pi[INVESTIGATOR_630155] T cell responses against glial tumors and promoting their  progression.  
 
Immunologic effect of stereotactic radiation:  
Hypofractionated stereotactic radiation plus concomitant TMZ followed b y TMZ is a feasible 
treatment option associated with potential survival benefits and low risk of complications in 
selected patients with recurrent malignant glioma. The potential advantages of combined chemo - 
radiation schedules in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas is currently under evaluation. 
Recent  reports  of stereotactic  radiation  in combination  with immune -modulatory  drug ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
(anti-CTLA -4) describe  systemic  tumor  regression  following  local  irradiation  of single  lesions17, 
18. This effect is consistent with an immune -activating effect of stereotactic radiosurgery, which 
has been predicted from preclinical models.  
 
Study rationale:  
The aim of this study  is to identify  the safety  profile  and the recommended  dose for phase  2 study 
of the combination  of indoximod  (portion  1, phase  1b study).  We will then evaluate  the tolerability 
and the preliminary activity in patients with recurrent GBM in three different  situations:  
• Combination of indoximod and temozolomide (bevacizumab -naïve patients)  
• Combination of indoximod and temozolomide in patients currently receiving or having 
received and failed  bevacizumab  
• Combination of indoximod and temozolomide with stereotactic radiation.  
Ancillary  studies  will be conducted  to assess  the correlation  between  intra-tumoral  IDO expression 
or serum biomarkers (immune monitoring) and treatment  efficacy.  
If the current study s hows an acceptable safety profile and suggests preliminary evidence of 
activity,  this will provide  the justification  for subsequent  randomized  phase  2 studies  in refractory 
GBM.  
This study  conducted  in adults  will be expanded  to include  pediatric  patients  in a linked  companion 
protocol that will be initiated after the completion of the phase 1 portion in  adults.

indoximod in combination with teiuozolomide, it is necessary to determine the attiibiition o f all 
toxicities. Howevel,  when  telnozolomide  is administered  as standard  regimen,  it is associated  with 
sipnificont toxicities that may confound efforts to define the tiue toxicity of new agents added to

and response.  
 
In the presence of clinical neuro -deterioration, a brain MRI will be performed to evaluate 
the presence  of tumor  progression  versus  tumor  necrosis  (and  brain  edema).  If the diagnosis 
remains questionable, MR Spectroscopy will be performed, as usually  recommended.  
 
If temozolomide is discontinued due to toxicity, patients may continue to receive indoximod

The initial dose of indoximod will be 600 mg BID. If a RLT is reported at Dose Level 1, a lower 
dose may be added after consultation between the Investigators, Medical Monitor and Sponsor, 
depending on the cumulative safety data. The protocol will be amend ed at that time accordingly.

longer than [ADDRESS_840610] to follow -up. Further therapy will be at the d iscretion of the treating  physician.  
 
 
6.12 Criteria for Removal from Study  Therapy  
 
Patients  will be removed  from  study  therapy  when  any of the criteria  listed  in Section  6.9 applies. 
If rapid life -threatening disease progression happens, or unacceptable adverse event(s) occur, or 
patient decides to discontinue the study, or patient becomes pregnant or starts breast -feeding, the 
patient will be removed from the study therapy. T he reason for study removal and the date the 
patient was removed must be documented on the Case Report  Form.  
 
7.0 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  
 
7.1 Temozolomide  (Temodar®) 
 
First Cycle: Temozolomide will be started at a dose of 150 mg/m2/day. Patients that had already 
been on temozolomide pre -study at a dose of 100 mg/m2/day due to temozolomide toxicity (i.e., 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, etc.) can start the study at 100 mg /m2/day at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  
 
Second  Cycle:  If patients  tolerate  the first cycle  of combination  therapy  without  any temozolomide 
related toxicities, the patient may be dose escalated up to 200 mg/m2/day at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  The dose of temozolomide  will be modified  according  to: (1) non-hematologic 
AE during the preceding treatment cycle, as well as (2) the worst ANC and platelet counts. 
Recalculation of BSA and temozolomide doses is required if the patient has a 10% or greater 
weight change (+/ -) from baseline or from the last weight  used to calculate BSA and drug  doses.  
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/2015  
Confidential  25  
  
 
Delay: On day 1 of each cycle (within the prior 72 hours), ANC 1.5 x 109/L, platelet count 100 x 
109/L and all grade 3 or 4 non -hematologic AEs (except for alopecia, nausea, and vomiting) must 
have res olved (to grade 1).  
 
If AEs persists, treatment should be delayed by [ADDRESS_840611] still not resolved: then any further treatment with temozolomide 
should be stopped.  
 
Dose  Reductions:  If, during the first cycle,  all non-hematologic  AEs observed  were  grade  2 (except 
alopecia, nausea and vomiting) and with platelets > 100 x 109/L and ANC > 1.5 x109/L: then the 
temozolomide dose should remain the  same.  
 
Dose  reductions:  If any non-hematologic  AE observed  was grade  > 2 (except  alopecia,  nausea  and 
vomiting)  and/or  if platelets  < 50 x 109/L and/or  ANC  < 1 x 109/L, then the dose should  be reduced 
by [CONTACT_30560]  (table  2). Patients  who require  more  than two dose reductions  will have  treatment 
stopped.  
 
If any treatment -related non -hematologic AE observed was grade 4 (except alopecia, nausea and 
vomiting) then temozolomide treatment should be stopped.  
 
Subsequent cycles: Any dose reductions of temozolomide will be determined according to: (1) 
non-hematologic AE during the preceding treatment cycle, as well as (2) the lowest ANC and 
platelets observed. No dose escalation should be attempted. The same dose reductions as for the 
second cycle should be applied. Importan t: If the dose was reduced or delayed for AEs, there will 
be no dose escalation in subsequent treatment cycles.

In general, indoximod was very well tolerated in previous phase 1 trials and seldom required any 
dose reductions. If a dose reduction is deemed necessary due to intolerance from taking the 
required number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_630171] 3 -4 nausea, one dose reduction by  200 mg is permitted. 
Indoximod will not be restarted at full dose after a dose reduction. If this dose reduction is not 
tolerated then discontinuation of the study treatment is required.

• Gastrointestinal perforations (gastrointestinal perforations, fistula formation in the 
gastrointestinal tract, intra -abdominal  abscess)  
• Wound dehiscence and wound healing complications requiring medical  intervention.  
• Serious hemorrhage (i.e., requiring med ical intervention)  
• Severe arterial thromboembolic  events.  
 
At the discretion  of the treating  physician  if it is thought  to be the best possible  course  of treatment, 
subjects may be able to stay on temozolomide plus indoximod or indoximod alone after 
temozolomide/bevacizumab treatment if they do not go on to other treatment  regimens.  
 
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse  event  (AE)  monito ring and reporting  is a routine  part of every  clinical  trial. The following 
list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine 
whether the event requires expedited reporting in addition to routine  reporting.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_840612] common adverse reactions ( > 10% incidence) are: fatigue, nausea, anorexia, anemia, 
diarrhea, lymphopenia, neutropenia, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, rash, vomiting, 
constipation, thrombocytopenia, headache, and alopecia.  
 
The most  common  Grade  [ADDRESS_840613]  developed  during 
treatment with indoximod are: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and  lymphopenia.

8.[ADDRESS_840615]  data accrued  on this study  will be reported  in accordance  with Code  of Federal  Regulations 
Title 21 (21CFR)  312.32.  
 
This study will utilize the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_840616] access to a copy of the CTC AE version 4.03. A copy 
of the CTCAE version 4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  
 
The Site P.I. will notify the IRB and NewLink Genetics (Study Sponsor) who in turn will notify 
the FDA and other regulatory agencies of al l serious adverse events as required by [CONTACT_550765]. All participating investigators will be notified of IND Safety Reports by [CONTACT_630203].  Serious  Adverse  Event  (AE)  Reporting  by [CONTACT_630204]. 
 
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures ar e considered to be adverse events if 
the abnormality:  
• results in study  withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse  event  
• is associated with clinical signs or  symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic  tests 
• is considered by [CONTACT_630205]/Attribution to the use of the drug: There is a reasonable  possibility (more likely than  not) 
that the experience may have  been caused by [CONTACT_630206].  
 
Attribution Categories:  
Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT related to the intervention. 
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related to the  intervention.  
Possible  The AE may be related to the intervention. 
Probable  The AE is likely related to the intervention. 
Definite  The AE is clearly related to the  intervention.  
 
A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacit y

Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events (21CFRPart312)  
 
Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY  serious adverse events within  
24 hours of learning of the SAE, whether or not they are considered related to the 
investigational agent(s)/intervention (21CFR312.64)  
 
An adverse events is considered SERIOUS if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:  
1. Death 
2. A life -threatening adverse  event  
3. An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_630172] > [ADDRESS_840617]

8.4 Reporting Requirements for Baseline Adverse  Events  
 
A pertinent positive finding identified on baseline a ssessment is to be documented as a Baseline 
Adverse  Event  using  CTCAE  terminology  and grade  on the provided  Baseline  CRF.  An expedited 
AE report is not required if a patient is entered on to the study with a pre -existing condition (e.g., 
elevated  laborator y value,  diarrhea).  The baseline  AE must  be re-assessed  throughout  the trial and 
reported if it fulfills expedited AE reporting  guidelines.  
1) If the pre-existing  condition  worsens  in severity,  the investigator  must  reassess  the event 
to determine if an expedited report is  required.  
2) If the AE resolved  and then recurs,  the investigator  must  re-assess  the event  to determine 
if an expedited report is required.  
3) No modification in grading is to be made to account for abnormalities exis ting at 
baseline.  
 
8.5 Adverse Event Case Report  Form  
 
All adverse events (regardless of grade and attribution) observed while on study and for [ADDRESS_840620] dose of treatment, only adverse events that are attributed to the study drug/combination 
(possible, probable, or definite) are required to be recorded on the adverse event  forms.

9.2 Temozolomide  (Temodar®)  
 
Please refer to the package insert for comprehensive information.  
 
Formulation Other Names: Methazolastone; Temozolomide is supplied in white opaque, 
preservat ive-free, two -pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], hard gelatin capsules of the following p.o. dosage strengths: [ADDRESS_840623] 5 mg based on 
surface area. Each capsule contains drug substance in combination with lactose,  anhydrous NF, 
colloidal silicon dioxide NF, sodium starch glycolate NF, tartaric acid NF, and stearic acid NF. 
The capsule shells contain gelatin NF, titanium dioxide USP, and sodium lautyl sulfate NF.  
 
Mode of Action : Alkylating agent of imidazotetrazino ne class.  
 
Storage and Stability : The capsules are packaged in amber glass bottles and should be stored at 
25°C. Temperature excursions between 15 and 30°C are permissible. Refer to the commercially 
labeled bottles for expi[INVESTIGATOR_22626].  
 
Pharmacokinetics : Temozolomide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_295508]; 
peak plasma concentrations occur in 1 hour. Food reduces the rate and extent of temozolomide 
absorption. Mean peak plasma concentration and AUC decreased by 32% and 9%, respectivel y, 
and Tmax increased 2 -fold (from 1.1 to 2.25 hours) when temozolomide was administered after a 
modified high -fat breakfast.  
 
Temozolomide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_32833] a mean elimination half -life of 1.8 hours and exhibits 
linear kinetics over the therapeut ic dosing range. Temozolomide has a mean apparent volume of 
distribution of 0.4 L/kg (%CV=13%). It is weakly bound to human plasma proteins; the mean 
percent bound of drug -related total radioactivity is 15%.  
 
Metabolism and Elimination: Temozolomide is spo ntaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH to 
the active species, 3 -methyl - (triazen -1-yl) imidazole -4-carboxamide (MTIC) and to 
temozolomide acid metabolite. MTIC is further hydrolyzed to 5 -amino -imidazole -4-carboxamide 
(AIC), which is known to be an interme diate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis and to 
methylhydrazine,  which  is believed  to be the active  alkylating  species.  Cytochrome  P450  enzymes 
play only a minor role in the metabolism of temozolomide and  MTIC.  
 
Relative to the AUC of temozolomide, the exposure to MTIC and ACI is 2.4% and 23%,  
h LG2102  Version 3: 08/27/20lfi   
  
 
respectively. About 38% of the administered teniozolonude tots radioactive dose is iecovered 
over 7 days; 37.7% in urine and 0.8% in feces. The majority of the 1’ecoveiy of radioactivity in 
urine is os unchanged temozoloinide (5.6%), AIC (12%), temozolomide acid metabolite (2.3%), 
and unidentified polai metabolites(s) (170/»). Oveiall clearance of teinozoloini de is about 5.5

In addition to a baseline scan, patients should be re -evaluated every 8 weeks (or every 2 cycles) 
after starting study treatment until response is n oted.  
 
12.1 Criteria for Evaluation of Therapy  Effectiveness  
 
Tumor response and regrowth can frequently be difficult to measure directly. Serial neurological 
exams and MRI scans may provide a guide to the actual course. Time interval to progression will 
be mea sured from registration until deterioration is documented by [CONTACT_630214].  
• Overall  survival  will be measured  from  the start of GBM  treatment  on protocol  until death.  
• Progression -free survival will be measured from the start of GBM treatment on protocol 
until the first occurrence of progression on protocol or  death.  
• The quality of survival will be measured by [CONTACT_630215].  
• Toxicities will be measu red using the CTCAE criteria, version  4.03 
 
12.2 Response  Criteria  
 
For this study we will be utilizing the RANO criteria (See Table 7):  
 
Complete Response  
Complete response requires all of the following: complete disappearance of all T1 gadolinium 
enhancing me asurable and nonmeasurable disease sustained for at least 8 weeks; no new lesions; 
stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions; and patient must be off corticosteroids or 
on physiologic replacement doses only, and stable or improved clinically. In t he absence of a 
confirming scan at least [ADDRESS_840628] indication of an objective response is noted, this 
response will be considered only stable disease.  
 
Partial Response  
Partial  response  requires  all of the following:  > 50% decrease,  compared  with baseline,  in the sum 
of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable T1 gadolinium enhancing lesions 
sustained  for at least 4 weeks;  no progression  of nonmeasurable  disease;  no new lesions;  stable  or 
improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared 
with baseline scan; and patient must be on a corticosteroid dose not greater than the dose at time 
of baseline  scan and is stable  or improved  clinically.  In the absence  of a confirming  scan at least [ADDRESS_840629] indication  of an objective  response  is noted,  this response  will be considered  only 
stable disease.  
 
Stable Disease  
Stable disease occurs if the patient does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or 
progression  (see next section)  and requires  the following:  stable  nonenhancing  (T2/FLAIR)  lesions 
on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared with basel ine scan and clinically stable  status. 
In the event that the corticosteroid dose was increased for new symptoms and signs without 
confirmation of disease progression on neuroimaging, and subsequent follow -up imaging shows 
that this increase  in corticostero ids was required  because  of disease  progression,  the last scan 
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/2015  
Confidential  39  
  
 
considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was 
equivalent to the baseline dose.  
 
Progression  
Progression is defined by [CONTACT_39132]: >25% increase in sum of the products of 
perpendicular  diameters  of enhancing  lesions  (compared  with baseline  if no decrease)  on stable  or 
increasing doses of corticosteroids; a significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesions on 
stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after 
initiation of therapy, not due to comorbid events; the appearance of any new lesions; clear 
progression of nonmeasurable lesions; or definite clinical deterioration not attributable to other 
causes apart from the tumor, or to decrease in corticostero id dose. Failure to return for evaluation 
as a result of death or deteriorating condition should also be considered as  progression.  
 
The apparent increases in tumor burden that sometimes precede responses (pseudo -progression) 
in patients receiving immune t herapy may reflect either continued tumor growth until a sufficient 
immune response develops or transient immune -cell infiltrate with or without edema (Wolchok 
CCR 2009). In the absence of overt clinical deterioration, patients with apparent radiographic 
disease  progression  in the first two months  of therapy  will be re-scanned  8 weeks  later to evaluate 
progression, as long as they remain clinically stable (Taal et al, Cancer  113:405 -410, 2008). In 
addition, a brain Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) may be performed (per investigator’s 
decision) to differentiate tumor progression versus tumor  necrosis/inflammation.  
 
Nonmeasurable enhancing lesion increased to measurable en hancing disease  
Patients  with non-measurable  enhancing  disease  whose  lesions  have  significantly  increased  in size 
and become measurable (minimal bidirectional diameter of > [ADDRESS_840630], 5 mm a part with 0 -mm skip) will also be considered to 
have experienced progression. Ideally, the change should be significant (>5 mm increase in 
maximal diameter or >25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of 
enhancing  lesions).  In general , if there  is doubt  about  whether  the lesion  has progressed,  continued 
treatment and close follow -up evaluation will help clarify whether there is true  progression.  
 
12.3 Special circumstances 
Non-target  lesions  
All other  lesions  (or sites of disease)  should  be identified  as non-target  lesions  and should  also be 
recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the maximum 
numbers  per organ  or total of all involved  organs  as well as non-measurable  lesions.  Measurements 
of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout 
follow -up. 
 
Steroid dose:  
Increase  in corticosteroid  dose alone,  in the absence  of clinical  deterioration  related  to tumor,  will 
not be used as a determinant of progression. Patients with stable imaging studies whose 
corticosteroid dose was increased for reasons other than clinical deterioration related to tumor do 
not qualify for stable disease or progression. They should be o bserved closely. If their 
corticosteroid dose can be reduced back to baseline, they will be considered as having  stable  
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/2015  
Confidential  40  
  
 
disease;  if further  clinical  deterioration  related  to tumor  becomes  apparent,  they will be considered 
to have progressio n. The date of progression should be the first time point at which corticosteroid 
increase was  necessary.  
 
Clinical deterioration  
Determination of clinical deterioration is left to the discretion of the treating physician, it is 
recommended that a decline in the KPS from [ADDRESS_840631] 7 days, be 
considered neurologic deterioration unless attributable to comorbid events or changes in 
corticosteroid dose. Similarly, a decline in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and WHO 
performance scores from 0 or 1 to 2 or 2 to 3 would be considered neurologic deterioration.  
 
Uncertainty regarding progression  
The patient may continue on treatment  and remain under close observation (e.g., evaluated at 4 - 
week intervals). If subsequent evaluations suggest that the patient is in fact experiencing 
progression, then the date of progression should be the time point at which this issue was first 
raised.  
 
Multifocal Tumors  
 
Progressive disease is defined as > 25% increase in the sum of products of perpendicular 
diameters of all measurable lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurements after 
initiation of therapy. The appearance of a new lesion or un equivocal progression of nontarget 
lesions will also be considered progression.  
 
Partial response is defined as >50% decrease, compared with baseline, in the sum of products  of 
perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks with stable or 
decreasing corticosteroid  doses.

Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic  deterioration.”  Every  effort  should  be made  to document  the objective  progression, 
even after discontinuation of treatment. In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish 
residual disease from normal  tissue.  
12.5 Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response 
Confirmation  
To be assigned  a status  of PR or CR, changes  in tumor  measurements  must  be confirmed  by [CONTACT_630216]. In the 
case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study e ntry 
and at a minimum interval of eight weeks (see section  12.2).  
 
Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR 
or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that rec urrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). The duration of overall CR is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met fo r CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively 
documented.  
 
Duration of Stable Disease  
Stable  disease  is measured  from  the start of the treatment  until the criteria  for progression  are met, 
taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment  started.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_840633] criteria. The purpose of tumor 
measurements will be to assess benefit to the patients f rom treatment and to determine 
appropriateness for continuing on study. For the purposes of this study, patients should be re - 
evaluated according to the study guidelines and undergo imaging studies as highlighted in the 
study calendar. Following documenta tion of an objective response, confirmatory scans will also 
be obtained a minimum of eight weeks later.

NewLink Genetics (sponsor) will perform on -site monitoring visits as outlined in the Monitoring 
Plan for this clinical trial. The dates of the visits will be recorded by [CONTACT_413774] a trial cent er 
monitor visit log to be kept at the site. The first routine monitoring visit will usually be made 
approximately 4 weeks after enrollment has begun at that site. At these visits the monitor will 
verify the data entered onto the CRFs with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40961] (source documents).  
 
At a minimum, source documentation must be available to substantiate patient eligibility and 
participation, proper informed consent procedures, adherence to protocol procedures, record of 
safety  and efficacy  parameters,  adequate  reporting  and follow -up of adverse  events,  administration 
of concomitant medication, drug receipt/dispensing/return records, study medication 
administration information, and date of completion and  reason.  
 
Specific items required as source documents will be reviewed with the investigator prior to the 
study. Findings from this review of CRFs and source documents will be outlined in a Site Visit 
Report  and discussed  with the investigator.  The sponsor  expects  that, during  monitoring  visits,  the

Participation of Children  
A study to evaluate the efficacy of indoximod in children (< 16 years of age) is planned once p art 
[ADDRESS_840639]'s tumor, their overall survival might be 
improved.  
Given  the safety  demonstrated  by [CONTACT_630230],  and the poor prognosis  of 
this patient  population,  it is believed  that the possible  benefits  from  improved  survival  probability 
far outweigh the risk to the patient. The information obtained in this study may be extremely 
valuable  in the treatment of malignancies in the future. The chance of this experimental treatment 
to provide clinical benefit is unknown. All possible benefits and risks will be carefully explained 
to all subjects  and the Informed  Consent  Document  will be signed  by [CONTACT_630231].  
There are no new anticipated severe adverse side effects to the treatment approach technique 
employed in this study. Theoretical risks may include the induction of unanticipated autoimmune 
disease and/or liver, kidney, lung, heart and CNS damage and/or coagulopathy and bleeding as a 
result of excessive activation of the complement system. Expected risks and discomforts to the

that they can withdraw  or decide  against  treatment  at any time without  adverse  consequences.  The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_630184] c onsent process and a

Recruitment Strategy  
Patients, their physicians or family members may contact [CONTACT_630232]. Information 
about the clinical trial can be obtained at clinicaltrials.gov. Given the number of patients with 
glioblastoma and the limited therapy available, we believe e nrollment for this trial will be 
completed in less than [ADDRESS_840641]  practices  will be

14.0 STATISTICAL  METHODS  
 
14.1 General statistical  considerati ons 
 
This is an open -label phase 1b/[ADDRESS_840642] deviation, median, 
and range (minimum/maximum); categorical variables will be presented as frequency counts and 
percentages; and time -to-event variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier medians and 
survival plots. Data listings will be create d to support each table and to present all data.  
The data will be tabulated and analyzed with respect to patient enrollment and disposition, 
demographic and baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant medications, efficacy and safety 
measures on a per cohort basis for phase 2, and on a per dose level for phase 1. The efficacy 
analysis will be conducted on the Efficacy Evaluable Population and safety analysis will be 
performed on the Safety Population as described in section 14.5.  
Maximum tolerable dose for indoximod with temozolomide will be estimated based on the data 
by [CONTACT_2329] a formal statistical inference procedure based on the percentage of RLT per dose. RP2D 
will then be determined based on the estimated MTD, which should not exceed 1/6 of RLT.  
In the phase  2 trial, the observed  6-month  progression  free survival  (PFS),  overall  survival,  overall 
response rate, duration of response, toxicity and tolerability will be summarized and compared 
with those  reported  in the literatures  for standard -of-care treatment.  PFS and OS will be calculated 
starting at the initiation of indoximod. Historical control was chosen in place of active control  for 
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/[ADDRESS_840643],  separately.  
The correlation of risk factors pertinent to patients’ outcome or response will be assessed in an 
exploratory fashion when sample size allows.  
14.2 Sample  Size 
Phase 1  
Up to 18 evaluable patients with high -grade glioma will be enrolled in the trial . The actual number 
of patients will depend on the RLT and MDT as described in in Section 6.2.  
 
Phase 2  
 
The sample size will be based on the primary end point of 6 -month PFS. PFS will be calculated 
starting at the initiation of indoximod therapy. A modified Fleming procedure by A’Hern (2001) 
for single stage phase -II clinical trial will be used and implement ed by [CONTACT_276757]12 software (NCSS, 
LLC).  The sample  sizes  for cohorts  2a, 2b, and 2c are based  the following  information  of standard 
of care (SOC) and experimental combination therapy (ECT) of percent of patients with 6 -month 
progression free  survival:  
Cohort 2a : 0.[ADDRESS_840644] (22) 
Cohort 2b: 0.[ADDRESS_840645] (23) 
Cohort 2c: 0.[ADDRESS_840646] (24) 
 
Due to differences in expected rates of enrollment between the phase 2 cohorts (Cohort 2a being 
expected to enroll more readily) as well as the desire to more accurately inform a potential 
randomized trial focusing on the patients eligible for inclusion in  Cohort 2a, the statistical 
stringency for Cohort 2a will be higher than that for 2b and 2c.  
 
The minimum required sample sizes estimated are 68, 24, and 40 for cohort 2a, 2b, and 2c, 
respectively.  
 
The sample size for each cohort is estimated to provide 9 0% power at significance level 2.5% for 
Cohort 2a and 80% power at significance level 10% for Cohorts 2b and 2c.  
 
14.3 STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS 
Phase 1b portion  
➢ Primary  endpoint:  
The recommended phase 2 dose will be based on dose escalation method provided in secti on 
6.2, Table 1.  
 
➢ Secondary  endpoints:  
• The adverse events will be listed along with identification of the regimen -limiting 
toxicities (RLT) of indoximod plus temozolomide in combination  therapy

Confidential  48  
  
 
• The overall dose of temozolomide delivered and timing of administration will be 
compared to historical control using  T-test. 
 
Phase 2 portion  
 
➢ Primary  endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is defined as the rate of 6 -month progression free survival (PFS) starting at 
the initiation  of indoximod  among  all participants.  The study  has three  cohorts  of patients  (2a, 2b, 
and 2c). 
 
The following definitions of the parameters ap ply to all the cohorts:  
P0 = the maximum proportion of the 6 -month PFS under SOC.  
P1 = the minimum response proportion of PFS under the new Combination Therapy. 
If the number of responses ≥ R+1, P 0 is rejected  
If the number of responses ≤ R, P 1 is rejected .

Cohort 2a:  
A total of up to sixty -eight  (68) evaluable  patients  with intracranial  glioblastoma  or gliosarcoma  and 
not currently on bevacizumab will be enrolled into cohort 2a of phase 2. By [CONTACT_2671] 6 -months 
follow  up period,  a decision  will be made  if the proportion  of patients  with PFS,  P, is ≤ 0.25 or ≥ 0.44. 
If the number of patients with PFS is 25 or more, the hypothesis that P ≤ 0.25 is rejected with a target 
error rate of 0.025. If the number of patients with PFS is 10 or less, the hypothesis that P ≥ 0.44 is 
rejected with a target error rate of 0.10 (beta  =1-power).  
 
Cohort 2B:  
A total of up to twenty -four (24) patients with previous  bevacizumab treatment will be enrolled 
into cohort 2b and receive bevacizumab in addition to indoximod with temozolomide. If a patient 
has been taken off bevacizumab after progressing on bevacizumab prior to entry into the study, 
the patient will be consi dered with Cohort 2b but may receive temozolomide / study drug alone. 
By [CONTACT_2671] 6 -months follow up period, a decision will be made if the proportion of  patients 
with PFS, P, is ≤ 0.42 or ≥ 0.65. If the number of patients with PFS is 14 or more, the  hypothesis 
that P ≤ 0.42 is rejected  with a target  error  rate of 0.10.  If the number  of patients  with PFS is 13 or 
less, the hypothesis that P ≥ 0.65 is rejected with a target error rate of 0.20 (beta  =1-power).  
 
Cohort 2C:  
A total of up to forty (40) patients with current potential indication for stereotactic re -irradiation 
will be enrolled into cohort 2c and be treated with indoximod with temozolomide and stereotactic

radiosurgery. By [CONTACT_2671] 6 -months  follow up period, a decision will be made if the 
proportion  of patients  with PFS,  P, is ≤ 0.40 or ≥ 0.58.  If the number  of patients  with PFS is 21 or 
more, the hypothesis that P ≤ 0.40 is rejected with a target error rate of 0.10. If the number of 
patient s with PFS is 20 or less, the hypothesis  that P ≥ 0.58 is rejected  with a target  error  rate of 
0.20 (beta =1 -power).  
 
➢ Secondary  endpoints:  
• The Overall Response Rate (ORR), overall survival, and tolerability of indoximod plus 
temozolomide  will be evaluated  for patients  with progressive  GBM  using  methods  listed 
in the section  14.1.  
 
• The Overall  Response  Rate (ORR)  and tolerability  of indoximod  plus temozolomide  and 
bevacizumab  will be evaluated,  for patients  with GBM,  whose  disease  progressed  during 
therapy with a bevacizumab -based regimen, using methods listed in the section  14.1.  
 
• The Overall  Response  Rate (ORR)  and tolerability  of indoximod  plus temozolomide  and 
stereotactic radiotherapy will be evaluated, for patients with GBM patients who may 
reasonably benefit from tumor debulking, using methods listed in the section  14.1.  
 
14.4 Treatment Randomization and  Blinding  
 
This is an open -label; single arm, phase 1/2 study; thus, randomization and blinding are not part 
of the study design.  
14.5 Study Populations and analysis  datasets  
The definitions of study populations are as follows:  
1) Enrolled (Intent -to-Treat): This population will comprise all patients who were enrolled in 
the study whether or not the study drug was  administered.  
2) Safety: This population will comprise all patients who receive at least one infusion of 
indoximod and temozolomide. This population will be analyzed for  safety.  
3) Efficacy  Evaluable  - This population  will comprise  all patients  who receive  at least one dose 
of study  drugs,  indoximod  with temozolomide,  and either  undergo  at least one post-baseline 
assessment  or die before  any evaluation.  For sensitivity,  analyses  the efficacy  endpoints  may 
be repeated in subsets of this  population.  
No adult group (except patients with cognitive impairment) is being excluded from 
participation. Patients of both genders, from all racial and ethnic groups are eligible for this 
study. There is no information suggesting differences in absorption, metaboli sm, or 
disposition or disease response to the study drug among racial or ethnic groups or between 
the genders.  Efforts  will be made  to extend  the accrual  to a representative  population,  but, in 
a study  accruing  small  numbers  of patients  such as this one, the enrollment  diversity  may not 
be optimal.  
Pediatric patients (<16 years of age) are excluded from evaluation in this study for safety 
considerations.

Appendix C: Neuro -Oncology Consent Process 
Neuro -Oncology Consent Process  
Our program offers clinical trials for patients with brain tumors at different stages of disease. We  
offer  clinical  trials  to patients  who are newly  diagnosed  with a brain  tumor,  as well as patients  who 
had disease progression or recurrent brain tumors. We believe that these clinical trials are a good 
option  for patients  with incurable  cancer  and strive  to offer  a clinical  trial as a treatment  option  for 
each of our patients. Furthermore, many patient s with recurrent disease have no FDA approved 
effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55328], so the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial for these patients 
provides an important therapeutic option. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the majority of brain tumor patients with 
sufficientl y good  performance  status  to participate  in clinical  trials  will have  the cognitive  capacity 
to understand  and provide  consent  to participate  in a clinical  trial and sign the appropriate  consent 
documents. However, some patients are capable of understanding and providing consent, yet  they 
have  a neurologic  deficit  as a result  of disease  or treatment  that causes  the inability  to write  or sign 
their name [CONTACT_1639] a document. Occasionally, there ar e patients who are not capable of providing 
consent independently due to cognitive impairment or communication deficits related to disease 
or treatment that they have received for their disease. Our process for obtaining consent is as 
follows:  
 
1. Patients with a brain tumor with full cognitive and physical ability will independently 
provide consent with a signature [CONTACT_630265].  
2. Patients with a brain tumor with full cognitive ability, but neurologic impairment who 
cannot provide a signature, will provide full consent verbally  using the consent document, 
make  a mark  if they can, and then have  a witness  sign the consent  attesting  that the patient 
consented willingly after a full consent process. A family member can act as a witness in 
this situation or anyone outside of the study team can witness this process. A witness 
signature [CONTACT_630266].  
3.  If the inves tigator  has determined  that the patient  has significant  cognitive  impairment  and 
cannot independently provide consent, an LAR will be required. Verbal assent will be 
obtained,  but written  assent  may not be possible  depending  on the level  of physical  and/or  
cognitive impairment. If written assent is possible, the participant will provide assent by 
[CONTACT_630237]. The LAR will be informed of their 
obligation  as a surrogate  decision  maker  to determine  the patient’s  wishes  or what  is in the 
best interest of the patient. The entire consent process will be well documented in the 
research records and include the Investigator’s assessment of the participant’s ability to 
provide consent independently or the need for an  LAR . 
 
The investigators will assess each patient and determine if the patient is competent to 
independently consent to a clinical trial based on their ability to express understanding of the 
information  presented  regarding  the treatment  options  and expression  of their desire  to participate 
in the clinical trial. In some cases, use of a patient advocate or neuro -cognitive testing may be 
included  in the process  to help determine  if patient  is able to give consent  themselves  or if the LAR  
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/2015  
Confidential  56  
  
 
is more  appropriate.  In situations  in which  patients’  ability  to give consent  themselves  is not clear, 
the LAR  process  will be utilized.  The investigator’s  assessment  will be documented  in the consent 
documentation  notes  that are kept in the research  chart  along  with the original  consent  forms.  (See 
attached).  
 
Justification for Including Cognitively Impaired Individuals  
 
Our target population is patients with brain tumors. Not all patients who have brain tumors are 
cognitively  impaired.  However,  for those  individuals  who are cognitively  impaired,  we would  like 
to offer them the same opportunity to participate in our clinical trials and to do it in a way that is 
consistent with the regulations for obtaining consent in human subjects. Exclusion of cognitively 
impaired patients would be discriminatory, and as described above, many of these patients have 
no proven effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55328], so participation in a clinical trial is the best opportunity 
they have for treatment with potentially effective novel  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Greater than Minimal Risk/Risk and Benefit  
 
The clinical  trials  that are being  conducted  for the treatment  of primary  brain  tumors  are more  than 
minimal risk trials. Participation in a clinical trial for an incurable brain tumor offers the prospect 
of direct benefit to an  individual.  
 
Cognitively impaired individuals may be at greater risk for non -compliance on a clinical trial and 
may not be able to completely report adverse events or side -effects of treatment. All cognitively 
impaired individuals must have a LAR who acts as a caregive r to ensure compliance, including 
drug administration and reporting of toxicities in some cases. The benefit for including these 
patients is that they may have an opportunity to receive a treatment on a clinical trial that would 
not otherwise be available to them.  
 
Additional Consent Considerations  
 
As it is expected that some brain cancer patients will have cognitive impairment, it is appropriate 
to include adults with impaired decision making capacity.  
 
Patients may be able to provide consent independentl y at the time of enrollment, but may have 
cognitive decline while on a study. If there is noticeable decline that includes loss of ability to 
understand  or communicate  effectively,  and patient  is going  to continue  on trial, then consent  from 
an LAR may be appropriate to continue participation in a clinical  trial. 
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/[ADDRESS_840650] one of the following consent processes that will be followed for the above patient.  
 
◻ The patient has full cognitive and physical ability to independently provide consent  with 
a signature [CONTACT_630267]. 
 
◻ The patient has full cognitive ability and is able to provide verbal consent to participate in 
this clinical trial ; however, s/he is not physically able to provide a signature [INVESTIGATOR_378028] a 
neurologic impairment. If possible, the participant will “make their mark” on the consent 
document. I, as the investigator, attest that the patient has provided verbal consent to 
partic ipate in this trial, and the process has been witnessed by [CONTACT_102]’s family 
member or a representative outside of the study  team.  
 
◻ The patient has significant cognitive impairment and is unable to independently provide 
consent. I, as the investigator, believe that participation in the clinical trial is a good 
treatment option for this patient. I attest that this has been discussed with the patient’s 
Legally Authorized Representative (LAR), who understands his/her obligation as a 
surrogate decision maker . The LAR has agreed to participation in the clinical  trial.

INTRODUCTION  
Before agreeing to participate in this research study, it is important that you read and understand the 
following explanation of the proposed procedures. This document descri bes the purpose, procedures, 
benefits,  risks,  discomforts  and precautions  of the study.  It also describes  the alternative  procedures  that are 
available  to you and your right  to withdraw  from  the study  at any time.  No guarantees  or assurances  can be 
made  as to the results  of the study.  You must  be completely  truthful  with your study  doctor  regarding  your 
health history, including past and present usage of both prescription and non -prescription medications, 
including herbals. If you are not complete ly truthful with your study doctor you may harm yourself by 
[CONTACT_4907]. This form tells you about a research study. Research studies are voluntary and 
include only those who wish to participate. We may learn about new things that make you want to stop 
being  in the study.  If this happens,  you will be informed.  You can then decide  if you want  to continue  to be 
in the  study.  
 
The study doctor may remove you from this study for any reason. Any new information about the study 
medicine will be given to you so you may decide to continue in the study or leave it.  
 
You may be taken out of the study if:  
1. Staying in the study would be  harmful.  
2. You need treatment not allowed in this  study.  
3. You fail to follow  instructions.  
4. The study is cancelled.  
5. Your disease  progresses.  
 
If you should decide to leave the study, you should tell the study doctor or study staff. They will make sure 
that proper procedures are followed and a final visit is made for your safety  
 
Why is this research study being done?  
This study is being done to test the feasibility of combining the approved drug therapy temozolomide 
(Temodar) with an experimental drug called indoximod. “Experimental” means the drug has not been 
approved by [CONTACT_630238], including the US Food and Drug  Administration 
(FDA).  
 
Temozolomide is an oral medicine that is approved for commercial use as a prescribed drug by [CONTACT_630239]. The experimental (study) drug, indoximod, is an oral medication that 
blocks an enzyme (a type of  protein that affects other proteins in the body) called IDO. Doctors think that 
tumors  use IDO to escape  attack  by [CONTACT_39625]’s  immune  system.  By [CONTACT_630240],  indoximod 
may help your body attack the tumor cells more effectively. Indoximod given along with various 
chemotherapy agents such as temozolomide may increase the effectiveness of the  chemotherapy.  
 
Why am I being asked to take part in this study?  
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have brain cancer.  
 
How many people will take part in the study?  
This study will have two parts, a dose -escalation phase (the first part of the study) and then later, a dose - 
expansion  part (the second  part of the study).  Enrollment  for the first part of the study  is now complete  and 
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/[ADDRESS_840652] to take part?  
It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you decide not to participate in the research stud y, 
your decision will not affect the medical treatment and care you are entitled to receive. If you do decide to 
take part after reading  this Informed  Consent  Form,  you will be asked  to indicate  your consent  to participate 
in this study by [CONTACT_630241].  
 
If you decide to take part, you are still free to withdraw from study procedures and/or study treatment at 
any time. If you do not want to take part in the study, your study doctor will discuss different options that 
are available to you. These options may  include:  
• Treatment with other chemotherapy drugs such as temozolomide  alone;  
• Treatment with medications that will make you feel more comfortable, but have no effect on your 
cancer;  
• Other experimental  treatments;  
• No treatment  
 
What will happen if I take part in this study?  
Indoximod will be given to you orally twice a day for [ADDRESS_840653] cycle. In Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles, you will attend the clinic every 
other week as long as you are receiving the treatment. Your doctor will tell you the dose of Indoximod 
before you begin study treatment.  
 
Subjects will be treated in one of the two phases of this study: dose -escalation or dose -expansion. The 
dose-escalation phase occurs first and enrollment has been completed for this portion of the study. You 
are being asked to participate in the dose expansion phase of the  study.  
 
Screening  
The screening period is held within [ADDRESS_840654] given consent to participate in this  study:  
 
• Medical history, including information about you and your cancer, previous treatments for your 
cancer and other medications you are taking or have taken. Certain medications are not allowed to 
be taken during the study  treatment.  
• Complete physical exam inc luding vital signs (heart rate, temperature, breathing rate, blood 
pressure, height and  weight)  
• Performance Status (questions about your ability to perform everyday  activities)  
• Your tumor size will be measured by [CONTACT_9268] [Magnetic Resonance Image; combines a s eries  images 
taken from many different angles and computer processing to create cross -sectional images of the 
brain].  
• Standard blood tests, using up to 6 teaspoons of blood, to measure your liver and kidney function, 
white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, your blood sugar and blood electrolytes and if you 
are female and able to become pregnant, to confirm you are not pregnant. You will not be  allowed 
to enter the study of you are pregnant or  lactating.  
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/2015  
Confidential  60  
  
 
• Research blood tests will be  taken to monitor how your body will be affected by [CONTACT_33641]. These 
initial  tests will serve  as a guide  to see how your body  reacts  after you have  received  the study  drug 
throughout the  study.  
• An ECG to determine if your heart is healthy enough for treatment.  
• Additionally,  3 ½ teaspoons  of blood  will be drawn  and stored  for future  testing  of an enzyme  that 
is released in tumors, called IDO enzyme (this is an immune suppressing enzyme released by  [CONTACT_630242]). This is an optional test that may help us better 
understand who will respond to study treatment with indoximod. You will sign a separate consent 
for this  testing.  
 
On Study Procedures  
 
• Approximately [ADDRESS_840655] will be performed once every 6 months during your follow up  visits.  
• At week  1 of each Cycle,  approximately  3 ½ teaspoons  of blood  will be drawn  and stored  for future 
testing  of an enzyme  that is released  in tumors,  called  IDO enzyme  (this is an immune  suppressing 
enzyme  released  by [CONTACT_630243]).  This is an optional  test 
that may help us better understand who will respond to study treatment with indoximod. You will 
sign a separate consent for this  testing.  
• ECG – An electrocardiogram will be taken [ADDRESS_840656] courses of treatment. If there is any extra preserved tissue from the 
biopsy remaining after it has been used to make a diagnosis, a small portion of the tissue will be requested 
as part of this study to look fo r the presence of the IDO/TDO enzyme. A separate biopsy will not be done 
for research purposes alone. It is not required for participation in this study, and you do not have to agree 
to provide the tumor sample. If you say no, you can still participate in the main study. This testing will 
not benefit you directly or change how your disease is  treated.  
I agree to have left over tumor tissue provided for this study to test for IDO and TDO expression.  
 
   YES   NO   Initials  
 
 
 
Treatment regimen  
If you continue to be eligible for study participation after screening, you will begin taking 6 capsules of 
indoximod  (study  drug)  two times  per day. Indoximod  comes  in 200mg  capsules.  No food should  be taken 
for at least [ADDRESS_840657] 
swallow the capsules whole with a full glass of water and not chew them. It is very important that you 
follow these instructions listed above because they could change the safety and how well the study drug 
works.  
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/[ADDRESS_840658] bring  your dosing diary and 
indoximod bottle(s) back to the clinic at regular intervals so the study staff can make sure you are taking 
your indoximod as you should. The study staff will review the dosing diary with you to ensure accuracy 
and assess  compliance.  
 
Temozolomide (Temodar) will be taken orally for [ADDRESS_840659] any side effects during the treatment period, you and your doctor will decide if  you should 
continue in the study.  
 
DOSE -EXPANSION PHASE : 
Subjects  participating  in this phase  of the study  will receive  one of the dose levels  of indoximod  determined 
from the dose -escalation phase plus additional treatment as outlined below. This was determined to be 
1200mg twice daily. There are 3 groups in this part of the  study.  
 
1- Indoximod  and Temozolomide:  In this group  you will be getting  temozolomide  and indoximod  (at 
1200 mg twice  daily)  
2- Indoximod,  Bevacizumab  and Temozolomide:  If you are getting  a standard  brain  tumor  medication 
called bevacizumab (Avastin) and your disease progresses, you will continue to take the Avastin, 
along with temozolomide and indoximod (at 1200 mg twice daily). If you have previously taken 
bevacizumab and your disease progressed and your physic ian stopped the bevacizumab, you will 
only take the temozolomide and indoximod.  
3- Indoximod,  temozolomide  and radiation:  If you are a candidate  for radiation,  you will be getting  it 
along with temozolomide and indoximod (at 1200 mg twice  daily).  
 
You will return  to your doctor’s  office  at regular  intervals  so that your disease  can be monitored  and routine 
blood  tests and safety  evaluations  can be carried  out. Please  tell your study  doctor  or study  staff if you have 
any unusual symptoms. You will be closely monitored for any side effects and you should report any 
changes  in the way you feel to your study  doctor.  If you experience  any side effects,  your study  doctor  may 
instruct  you to stop the study  drug temporarily  and restart  at the same  or lower  dose after the side effect  has 
resolved.  
 
How long will you be asked to be on the study?  
 
You may continue to receive the study treatment as long as your cancer does not get worse. Your 
participation in the study may end at any time if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest to stop or you 
decide you do not wish to receive any more study  treatment. Even if you decide to stop study treatment 
you may continue to be followed by [CONTACT_630244] [ADDRESS_840660] to you for the supply of the study drug (indoximod) during 
your participation  in the study.  You will not be charged  for any of the tests and procedures  performed  solely  
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/2015  
Confidential  62  
  
 
for research purposes. All study -related testing (tests performed for research purposes only) will be 
provided to you by [CONTACT_630245]. Tests and procedures that are standard of care for your disease 
(not part of this research  study)  will be billed to your insurance  or Medicare.  Tests  and standard  procedures 
that are routine  care for your disease  that are not paid for by [CONTACT_1758],  and will be charged  to your insurance 
or Medicare,  if applicable.  This includes  medications  that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_630185]  (such  as temozolomide  and/or  bevacizumab).  You will be responsible  for all co-pays.  You 
or your insurance company will be charged for standard medical care and for any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. It is  
possible that your insurance or Medicare will not pay routine care charges because the treatment is taking 
place within a research study. If this happens, you will be responsible for these charges. A member of the 
research team will contact [CONTACT_630246]. Your study doctor will inform you of the potential cost to  you. 
You will not be paid to take part in this research study . 
 
Even  though  it probably  won’t  happen,  it is possible  that the manufacturer  may not continue  to provide  the 
indoximod to the study site for some reason. If this would occur, other possible options  are: 
 
• You might be able to get the indoximod from the manufacturer or your pharmacy, but you or your 
insurance company may have to pay for  it. 
 
• If there  is no indoximod  available  at all, no one will be able to get more  and the study  would  close.  
 
If a problem with getting indoximod occurs, your study doctor will talk to you about these options.  
 
What are the potential benefits if you take part in the study?  
 
We do not know if you will get any health benefits by [CONTACT_96428]. We do not know if the 
experimental study treatment will help you. That is why we are doing this study. We hope that what we 
may learn can benefit you and others in the future.  
What are the risks if you take part in the study?

• Headache  
• Hair loss  (alopecia)  
 
Rare : Likely to happen to less than 10%  
• Dizziness

Autoimmune Events  
Autoimmuni ty is a term that describes when your immune system begins to attack normal cells in your 
body. Two patients out of [ADDRESS_840661]. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_630186] “master gland” which coordinates the function of your other 
glands such as your thyroid, adrenals, and gonads (ovaries/testicles). If it does function properly (pi[INVESTIGATOR_12978]) you may experience symptoms of  
• weakness  
• fatigue  
• loss of libido (lack of interest in  sex) 
• You may need to take hormone replacement therapy to treat these or other  symptoms.  
 
Another hormone called ACTH (a hormone secreted by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_304]), excites the adrenal gland (a 
gland situated above the kidneys) to make steroids, particularly cortisol. If there is a decline in ACTH 
(ACTH deficiency) you may experience  
• weight  loss 
• lack of appetite  (anorexia)  
• weakness  
• nausea  
• vomiting  
• low blood pressure  (hypotension).  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_630187], but there is a risk of chronic autoimmune disease requiring treatment for longer 
periods  of time.  We will monitor  you closely  for any signs of autoimmune  conditions  and treat you for them 
if necessary.  Prior  experience  with other  immunotherapy  agents  seems  to indicate  those  who do develop  
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/[ADDRESS_840662] a higher likelihood of their cancers responding to tr eatment, but it is 
not known if this is the case with indoximod.  
 
Note:  Indoximod  in combination  with other  agents  could  cause  an exacerbation  (worsening)  of any adverse 
event currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may result in events never 
previously associated with either agent.  
 
Possible Side Effects and Risks of the Temozolomide (Temodar)  
 
During the study you will receive an anti -cancer drug called temozolomide (Temodar). This drug is 
approved by [CONTACT_1622]. This drug is also given orally for 5 days every 28 days. This drug, like m any other 
anti-cancer drugs, has side effects which include:  
 
Most common side effects (occur in 10% or more of patients):  
• Low white blood cell levels – increases risk of infection (Pneumocystis jirovecii 
pneumonia)  
• Low platelet levels – increases risk of  bleeding  
• Nausea/  Vomiting  
• Diarrhea  
• Generalized fatigue or  weakness  
• Hair loss  
• Fluid retention in ankles or  abdomen  
• Headache  
 
Less common side effects (occur in <10% of patients):  
• Allergic -type reaction, may include flushing, rash,  itching.  
• Abnormalities in liver function levels as determined by [CONTACT_630247] 
• Muscle  pain 
• Joint pain  
• Low red blood cell levels – increases risk of anemia and the need for blood  transfusions  
• Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_630188]  
• Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].  
 
Rare side effects (<1% of patients):  
 
• Elevated liver  enzymes.  
• Secondary malignancies like leukemia.  
 
To avoid the problem of pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, your study doctor may ask you to take an 
antibiotic while taking temozolomide.  
 
Unknown Risks  
 
You might have side effects or discomforts that are not listed in this form. Some side effects may not be 
known yet. New ones could happen to you. Tell the study doctor or study staff right away if you have any 
problems.  
 
Risks associated with standard care and alternative treatment:  
NLG2102  Version 3: 08/27/[ADDRESS_840663] 
common temporary side effects for some chemotherapy drugs may include:  
 
• Nausea and  vomiting  
• Loss of  appetite  
• Hair loss  
• Mouth  sores  
• Higher risk of infection (du e to decreased white blood  cells)  
• Bruising or  bleeding  
• Fatigue (feeling  tired)  
• Changes in your menstrual cycle if you are female (e.g. irregular periods to symptoms of 
menopause [end of  menstruation])  
 
A more complete listing of side effects for other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_630189]. 
Please talk with your study doctor about the risks of both this experimental therapy and any alternative 
methods of treatment that are available.  
 
We will tell you as soon as we can, if we find out more information about the side effects that are 
caused  by [CONTACT_630248].  During  the course  of this study,  we may find out more  information  that 
could be important to you. This includes information that, once learned, might cause you to change your 
mind  about  your willingness  to be in this study.  We will notify  you as soon  as possible  if such information 
becomes available.  
Is there any risk to your unborn children if you take part in this study? 
For Females:  
If you are pregnant, you may not participate in this study, because there may be risks to you and your unborn  
baby. Breastfeeding (nursing) mothers will not be included in this study, since it is not known whether the 
drugs in this study will be passed on to the baby [CONTACT_630249]’s milk. If you are currently breastfeeding 
and wish to continue, your study doctor may recommend another treatment.  
 
If you are a female of chi ldbearing potential (able to become pregnant), you will be given a pregnancy 
test at no cost to you before beginning any study treatment.  
 
Tell one of the study doctors right away  if: 
• You are  pregnant  
• You get  pregnant  
• You are  breastfeeding  
 
If you are male : 
We do not know  what  the study  drug will do to your sperm.  Should  you get a woman  pregnant,  there  could 
be harm to the unborn baby. You and your partner should use at least one effective birth control method 
(two are preferable when possible) if you are having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing 
potential.  
 
For males and females:  
Whether you are male or female, there may be risks to your unborn children. If you take part in this study, 
you must use at least one effective birth control method (two are preferable when possible) as discussed 
with your study doctor. Examples of accepta ble birth control methods include:  
• Oral birth control  pi[INVESTIGATOR_630190]2102  Version 3: 08/27/2015  
Confidential  66  
  
 
• Birth control  patch  
• Implanted (injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as intrauterine  device)  
• Barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms,  spermicidal)  
• Tubal ligatio n or vasectomy  
• Abstinence  
 
Certain birth control methods may not be a good choice for you (for example some patients with breast 
cancer  should  not use birth  control  methods  that contain  hormones).  You should  discuss  the method  of birth 
control which is bes t for you to use both during study treatment and for a period of time after study 
treatment.  Also,  if you are a sexually  active  male  or premenopausal  female,  the study  staff will review  your 
birth control use at each study visit. Use of contraception or abstinence should continue for a minimum of 
one month after completion of the  study.  
 
Please place your initials in the appropriate box below:  
 
 
I am surgically  sterile  (hysterectomy,  tubal  ligation  or vasectomy)  or have  gone  through  menopause 
(no period for 24 consecutive  months).  
 
 
I understand and agree to use contraception during study treatment and for the time recommended 
by [CONTACT_630250].  
 
 
Whether  you are female  or male,  you should  tell your study  doctor  immediately  if you become  pregnant  or 
if your partner becomes pregnant. The long -term effects of the study treatment on fertility are unknown. 
This means that it is unknown if study treatment with these medications will affect your ability to have 
children in the  future.  
 
Compensation for injury  
 
If you become ill or are hurt while you are in the study, get the medical care that you need right away.  
 
Sponsor Compensation  
 
Your safety is the major concern of every member of the research team. If you experience physical inj ury 
or illness as a result of participating in this research study, the sponsor will reimburse you for reasonable

Addendum to the Consent  
Consent to take and store additional blood samples  
 
The use of ‘you’ throughout this document refers to the research subject as an adult or child. If the research subject is les s than 
[ADDRESS_840667]’s parent or legal guardian must provide written consent for the child to participate in this study.  
 
 
We are asking  you to allow  us to take and store  an additional  sample  of your blood.  This is an optional  test 
that may help us better understand who will respond to treatment with  indoximod.  
 
This means we will take an additional 18 mL (about 3½ teaspoons) of blood to be stored for subsequent 
(later)  geneti c analysis  of an enzyme  that is released  in tumors,  called  IDO enzyme.  The IDO enzyme  is an 
immune suppressing enzyme released by [CONTACT_630261].  
 
These samples may be stored at NewLink Genetics Corporation within a clim ate controlled, restricted 
access area requiring key cards for entry. These samples will be used for future research to help us better 
understand who may respond to treatment with indoximod.  
 
These samples will only have subject identifiers consisting of your initials followed by [CONTACT_630262] (XX -111). No one except your physician or clinical research team will be able to connect your 
coded health information to you.  
 
You can decid e if you want us to store and use your samples for this future analysis of the IDO enzyme.  
 
You do not have to agree to these optional samples of blood in order to take part in the study that has been 
previously explained to you.

Title of Study:  
A Multicenter, Open -Label, Extension Study Intended to Evaluate the Long- term Safety  of Ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835306]’s Syndrome 
Study center(s): Approximately 60 sites in US, Canada and EU  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_349580]: TBD  
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: 3Q2019 
Estimated date last patient completed:  2Q2023, or until NDA 
approval or until development is discontinued by [CONTACT_429], whichever is sooner Phase of development:  
2b 
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long- term safety and tolerability of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835307] (aged ≥6 to ≤ 18 years at Baseline) with Tourette’s Syndrome (TS) that 
were previously enrolled in the EBS-101- CL-001 study (Phase 2b) and completed the Phase 2b study.  
The secondary objective is to evaluate the durability of effect of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835308] (aged 
≥6 to ≤ 18 years at Baseline ) with TS.  
Methodology:  
This is an international, multicenter, open -label, long-term extension study evaluating the safety of 
ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835309].  Subjects who 
completed the Phase 2b, randomized double-blind efficacy and safety study (EBS -101- CL-001) and 
who continue to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study will be eligible to participate in 
this study.  All subjects will be  titrated to a target dose of 2  mg/kg/day as subjects participating from 
previous studies will be tapered off of study medication to mainta in the blind. Subjects will complete 
study visits  every month for [ADDRESS_1159881] dose of 
study medication.  Study Visits may be completed in locations other than clinic  and/or safety and 
efficacy assessments required at these visits will be made available for remote administration  due 
to restrictions as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic or other qualifying event.   
Safety will be monitored throughout the study at all visits by [CONTACT_835356] (AE) monitoring, 
vital signs, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS), the Abnormal Involuntary 
Movement Scale (AIMS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) and Children's Depression Rating Scale- Revised (CDRS -R).  In addition to these 
assessments, a t Baseline, Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 safety will also be monitored by [CONTACT_835357], and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring.  In addition to the scales 
aforementioned, the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), Clinician Global Impression of

5.1. Background  on Tourette’s Syndrome  
Tourette’s Syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by [CONTACT_612409] (see box below with the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual for Mental Disorders – 5th Edition [DSM-5] diagnostic criteria).  The tics are brief in 
duration, occur spontaneously, and do not show a regular temporal pattern.  Further, the tics are not caused by [CONTACT_6589], other medical reasons, or confirmed neurological abnormality.  They 
can be consciously suppressed for some time  and are exacerbated by [CONTACT_174120].  Males are more 
susceptible than females , with a ratio of about 4.1 to 3.  Motor tics can include such things as 
eye-blinking, facial grimacing, mouth movements, head jerks, shoulder shrugs, and ar m/leg 
jerks.  In more severe cases , gyrating, bending, pi[INVESTIGATOR_778600], and dystonic movements are possible.  
Vocal tics are fast meaningless sounds or noises, and include such things as sniffing, throat 
clearing, grunting, barks, and squealing.  Complex vocal tics can include shouting out of single 
words, whole sentences or repeating words (echolalia).  In small numbers of subjects , explosive 
obscenities (coprolalia) are possible.
1,2  Diagnosis of TS is complicated because it often co -exists 
with other psychiatric illnesses.  Common co-morbid conditions include attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, and 
depression.
[ADDRESS_1159898] a variable 
course, with severe bouts interspersed with complete absence of symptoms.  Onset of tics  is seen 
early in childhood (average approximately 7 years) and peaks in the teenage years.  Vocal tics 
appear several years after the onset of motor tics.  For most subjects, the period of worst- ever tic 
severity is between [ADDRESS_1159899] into adulthood and require treatment.  Complete remission of tics is reported in approximately 50% of subjects.  Severe tics are thought to occur only in about 10% 
of the cases.

 DSM -V Diagnostic  Criteria  For Tourette's  Syndrome  
 
  Note: A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent,  nonrhythmic,  stereotyped motor movement  or 
vocalization.  
A. Both multiple  motor and  one or more  vocal  tics have been  present at some  time during the  
illness,  although  not necessarily  concurrently.  
B. The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than [ADDRESS_1159900] tic onset.  
C. The onset  is before  age 18 years.  
D. The disturbance  is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. Cocaine) 
or another medical condition (e.g. Huntington’s disease, postviral encephalitis).

Confidential  Page 22 of 76 Natural History of Tics  
 
Approaches to the treatment of tics include: education, behavioral therapy, pharmacological 
therapy, and treatment of comorbid conditions (attention deficit disorder [ADD], OCD).  Approximately, 20% of subjects do not need treatment.  Counseling and behavioral therapy may 
be sufficient with mild symptoms.  Medications should be considered when tics interfere with 
peer relationship s, social interactions, job or school performance, or activities of daily living.  
Medications should be started at low doses, titrated up slowly to lowest effective dose, and 
tapered slowly during non-stressful periods.  Medication therapy incudes: dopami ne receptor 
blocking agents, dopamine depleting agents, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], low dose dopamine agonists, 
botulinum toxin, and neurosurgical treatment.  Non -selective dopamine receptor blocking agents 
have been the mainstay of treatment and are the most effecti ve.  They suppress tics in 70-80% of 
patients.  Many patients eventually discontinue due to adverse events (AEs), including extrapyramidal disorders, somnolence, blood glucose changes, weight gain, and effects on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  
A selective D1 dopamine receptor blocking agent may mitigate against some of these AEs and 
has the potential to offer a safer alternative option.  
5.1.1. Disrupted Dopamine Systems in Tourette’s Syndrome  
The underlying mechanism responsible for TS is unknown.  Although the disease tends to run in 
families, there have been no definitive genetic mutations identified.
4  Research to date has 
indicated that dopamine circuits in the central nervous system (CNS) are intimately involved 
based on the following observations.5,6,7 
• Dopamine-rich areas of the brain (e.g., striatum) are believed to control motor tics . 
• Clinical neuroimaging studies of TS patients  implicate dopamine -rich brain areas . 
• Dopamine antagonists can ameliorate tics .

Clinical Summary: Legacy Schering -Plough Studies in Indications other than TS 
The earlier clinical program for ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612336]-Plough investigated the safety 
and effectiveness of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612337], cocaine addiction , and schizophrenia 
in adults.  These comprised 30 Phase 1 studies; seven Phase 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], 5 in subjects with schizophrenia and 2 (including 1 extension study) in subjects with cocaine addiction; and 1 completed Phase 2 and 3 discontinued Phase 3 studies in subjects with a primary diagnosis of moderate to severe obes ity.  
The Phase 1 studies examined ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612313]'s pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, bioavailability, distribution, food-effects on absorption, interactions with other drugs, bioequivalence of different

The results of these studies demonstrate that ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612338] -tolerated with no clinically 
significant changes in physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory 
tests, electroencephalograms  (EEGs) , neurological examinations, or liver function tests (LFTs) .  
Most of the reported AEs were mild to moderate in intensity.  The most commonly reported AE 
in Phase 1 clinical studies were somnolence.  Other commonly reported AE s in Phase 1 clinical 
studies were headache, fatigue, nausea, and insomnia. 
In a Phase 2 study (C197-184), 279 subjects with cocaine dependence in 3 dose groups (10-, 25-, 
and 100 mg/day) were exposed to ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835317] [ADDRESS_1159901] common AEs reported among all subjects in the cocaine addiction 
studies were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia, and somnolence.  Fatigue and somnolence appeared to be reported more often in subjects treated with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612364].  Somnolence 
appeared to occur in a dose-related fashion, occurring in 28% (26/94), 31% (29/94), 43% 
(39/91), and 20% (19/93) of subjects treated with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612327]  10-, 25-, and 100 mg/day, and 
placebo, respectively.   
Five open- label safety, tolerability  and Phase [ADDRESS_1159902] commonly 
reported AE s were somnolence (21%, 12/56), headache, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness (each 
reported in 14%, 8/56 subjects), insomnia (9%, 5/56), dyspepsia (7%, 4/56), and anxiety (7%, 
4/56).  
In a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (C/I98-271), 185 subjects with a primary 
diagnosis of moderate to severe obesity were treated with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612327] (10 -, 30-, or 100 mg 
PO, once per day) for [ADDRESS_1159903] commonly reported AE s by [CONTACT_835359][INVESTIGATOR_612343], 19% (36/185); viral infection, 19% (36/185); somnolence, 18% (34/185); insomnia, 9% (17/185); and nausea, 9% (16/185).   
In three Phase 3, double-blind, placebo -controlled studies (P00359, P00396, and P00741), obese 
subjects including type 2 diabetic subjects were treated with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612327] (50 or 100 mg PO,

Following acquisition of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835319] S chering-Plough, two Phase 1 studies, one 
study in Lesch- Nyhan Disease (LND) subjects aged ≥6 years old (PSY101) and one study of the 
pharmacokinetics of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835320] v olunteers (PSY401), 
were completed.   
One Phase 2a study in adult subjects with pathological gambling (PSY201) was also completed.  
In addition, a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 3-period crossover study with an 
open-label extension in subj ects with LND (≥ 6 years old) (PSY102) was discontinued before 
completion for financial (non- safety related) reasons.  
In the Phase1 LND study (PSY101), in which [ADDRESS_1159905] commonly 
reported AE s were sedation (3 subjects), dystonia (2 subjects) and nausea (2 subjects). 
In a Phase 2a, single-blind (the subjects were blinded to treatment assignment), nonrandomized study, 28 subjects with pathological gambling (PSY201) received placebo (1-2 tablets/day orally 
depending on their urge to gamble) for 1 week and then ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612327]  (1-2 50- mg tablets/day 
orally depending on their urge to gamble) for [ADDRESS_1159906] commonly reported AE s 
(incidence ≥5%) were drowsiness (11%), fatigue (11%), anxiety (11%), vomiting (11%), 
headache (7%), f ever (7%), depression (7%), and rhinorrhea (7%).  
A Phase 3 study (PSY102) of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612350]-injurious behaviors in LND subjects was done.  A total of 9 pediatric subjects were enrolled before the study was terminated 
for non- safety rel ated reasons.  Ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835321] 50  mg/day (<20 kg 
body weight) or 100 mg/day (>20 kg body weight).  In the PSY102 LND study, [ADDRESS_1159907] dopaminergic systems, it is believed these AE s are 
uniquely seen in this population and are unlikely to occur in subjects without this disorder.

Study PSY301  
In a Phase 2a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study, 18 adult subjects with TS (PSY301) 
were given ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612327] 50 mg for 2 weeks followed by 100 mg for 6 weeks.  The primary 
outcome measure was Yale Global  Tic Severity Score (YGTSS).  After ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612312], 
YGTSS total score, motor tics score, phonic tics score, and overall impairment were all 
significantly decreased from baseline to endpoint, which indicated that the severity of tics was 
decreased.  The most commonly reported AE s (incidence≥20%) were sedation (33%), insomnia 
(33%), fatigue (33%), somnolence (28%), headache (22%), muscle twitching (22%), and anxiety (22%).

In a Phase 2b multicenter, double blind, randomized, crossover study (PSY302), 40 children/ 
adolescents (ages 7 -17 years) were given ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835322] 50 mg/day (if <75 lbs) or 
100 mg/day (if >75lbs) for 4 weeks.  The primary endpoint was the YGTSS Total (MP) Scores 
which were the sum of the motor and phonic subscales of YGTSS.  In the Intent -to-treat ( ITT) 
population, the mean (±  standard deviation [ SD]) YGTSS Total (MP) Scores at baseline were 
32.8 (±7.1) prior to ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612353] 33.7 (±6.7) prior to placebo treatment.  On Day 16 of the treatment period, YGTSS Total (MP) Scores decreased by 5.1 (±8.5) points on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835323] 2.1 (±4.7) points on placebo.  On Day 30, YGTSS Total (MP) Scores decreased by 5.6 (±8.7) points on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 3.4 (±5.8) points on placebo. Similar results were observed in the Evaluable population.  
In the ITT population, least square ( LS) means (± standard error [ SE]) of the difference between

Day 30.  The treatment differen ce was more obvious in the Evaluable population for both days 
(on Day 16, p=0.0155, and on Day 30, p=0.0435). 
With respect to secondary endpoints, the changes of subscale scores were similar to YGTSS 
Total (MP) Scores results.   The secondary endpoints were not ranked in a hierarchical order and 
multiplicity was not taken into account.  In the ITT population, the mean (±SD) motor, phonic, 
impairment, and global scores (the sum of motor, phonic and impairment scores) at baseline 
were 18.4 (±3.3), 14.4 (±4.9), 28.0 (±10.7), and 60.8 (±16.5) prior to ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612313]; and 18.3 (±3.4), 15.4 (±4.5), 27.5 (±9.3), and 61.2 (±14.0) prior to placebo, respectively.  Af ter 30  days of 
treatment, the decreases in scores compared to baseline were 3.3 (±4.2), 2.3 (±4.9), 7.0 (±11.6), and 12.6 (±18.7) on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612313]; and 1.6 (±3.3), 1.8 (±3.6), 3.0 (±9.1), and 6.4 (±13.4) on placebo, respectively.   Similar results were observed in the Evaluable population. 
In the ITT population, after 30 days of treatment, Clinician Global Impression ( CGI) Severity 
Scores decreased  by 0.8 (±0.7) points on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 0.2 (±0.9) points on placebo.  Also, after 
ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612312], the percentages of subjects with much improved, minimally improved, no 
change, minimally worse CGI Improvement ratings were 40.00%, 15.00%, 20.00%, and 12.5%, 
respectively;  while the percentages on placebo were 20.00%, 27.50%, 32.50%, and 12.50%, 
respectively.   Similar re sults were observed in the Evaluable population.  These data suggest that 
the subjects’ disease severity decreased and that they had greater improvement while on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612313].  
In the ITT population, the mean (±SD) DuPaul ADHD rating scale at baseline was 20.2 (±11.6) 
points prior to ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 22.1 (±11.3) points prior to placebo.  On Day 30, ADHD Scores 
decreased by 1.9 (±5.2) points on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 2.7 (±6.6) points on placebo.  ADHD scales were almost unchanged after ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612312]. Similar results wer e observed in the Evaluable

A consideration of the potential of risks that TS subjects may be exposed to, approaches to reducing any such risks, and the possible benefits that they may derive from their participation in EBS-101-OL-[ADDRESS_1159910] received treatment with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612359], including 1667 with obesity, 279 with cocaine addiction, 56 with 
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and schizophreniform disorder, 28 with pathological 
gambling, 1 adult with LND, 18 adults with TS, 40 children/adolescents with TS and [ADDRESS_1159911] shown that ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612360] (e.g., sedation, insomnia, psychiatric changes such as

vomiting). 
In subjects with TS, ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612361], one study in adult subjects with 
TS and one study in children/adolescents with TS.  In the pediatric TS study, overall, adverse 
events were more common in ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612362].  There were no serious adverse 
events (SAEs) and only one subject discontinued treatment due to an adverse event in the ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612363].  Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. Adverse events in the 
Psychiatric Disorders , Central Nervous System Disorders and Gastrointestinal Disorders 
categories were more common with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612364].  Notably, more subjects experienced 
adverse events of somnolence, insomnia, sedation, restlessness, irritability, nausea and vomiting 
with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612365].  There were no AEs of extra pyramidal symptoms in the 
pediatric study.  A higher percentage of subjects on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612366] 5 pounds or more during 
the study than with placebo (17.5% compared to 15%).  Orthostatic blood pressure assessments 
were not done (or not reported).  A table of weight changes was provided for the open- label 
extension study (PSY302A) and almost all of the children gained weight after 3, 6, [ADDRESS_1159912] commonly reported adverse events (incidence ≥20%) were sedation (33%), insomnia (33%), fatigue (33%), somnolence (28%), headache (22%), muscle twitching (22%) and anxiety (22%).  Two subjects developed adverse event of akathisia and one 
developed an adverse event of tremor, both of which are extrapyramidal reactions.  Three of 18 
subjects (16.7%) also discontinued study drug due to an adverse event. 
For the older obesity and cocaine dependence program, there were subjects who experienced 
adverse events of weight gain, suicidal ideation, diabetes, extrapyramidal reactions, somnolence, 
insomnia, hypotension and sexual side effects.  There was no raw dat a on orthostatic blood 
pressure.  In a table of all adverse events during the whole program, the adverse event of 
dyskinesia is listed but is not in any of the data tables.  When reviewing the large Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 studies in obesity and the other indications, the rate of tardive dyskinesia appears to be extremely low (or absent) and the rate of other extrapyramidal reactions (akathisia, tremor, etc.) 
appears at rates that are largely less than what is seen with D1/D2 antagonists.  Data for shifts in 
fasting glucose or lipi[INVESTIGATOR_612367]’s Brochure prepared by a previous sponsor 
and comments were made that there were no significant laboratory changes.  There did not 
appear to be a high rate of increased blood glucose or lipi[INVESTIGATOR_612368].  Additionally, data on orthostatic blood pressure changes were not documented but no adverse events of orthostatic hypotension were observed. 
5.3.2. Assessment of Benefit  
A review of the efficacy evaluations for ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612313] i n the two studies conducted in subjects with 
TS reveals improvement on the YGTSS scores and other measures of illness severity from 
baseline to end point.

Ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835305] 7.0, Amendment 6, 17 November 2021 
 
Confidential  Page 29 of 76 In a Phase 2a, open -label, non-randomized study (PSY301), the activity and safety of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612370] 18 adult subjects with TS was evaluated.  Subjects were to receive ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612327] 50 mg for 
2 weeks followed by 100 mg for 6 weeks.  The primary outcome measure was the YGTSS Total (MP) score. After ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612312], the YGTSS Total score, motor tics score, p honic tics 
score and overall impairment decreased from baseline to endpoint, suggesting that the severity of tics was decreased ( Table 16, Investigator’s Brochure).  
In a Phase 2b double-blind, randomized crossover study in children/adolescents (ages 7-
17 years) with TS (PSY302), 40 subjects were enrolled and 38 (95.0%) completed the study.  
The primary endpoint was the YGTSS Total (MP) score.   
Ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612371] a numerical decrease in the YGTSS Total score relative to the 
placebo
 treatment, b ut the decrease was not statistically significant ( Figur

Brochure).  The least squares means (±SE) of the difference between ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835326] -2.8885 (±1.5282); 95% CI: -5.9822, 0.2053, p=0.0664) on Day 16 and -2.1366 
(±1.6551; 95% CI: -5.4871, 1.2139, p=0.2045) on Day 30.  
Based on
 the available safety data, there are some safety advantages for ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612372] 
D2 antagonists, but the full measure of differentiation will not be known until after a larger and 
longer Phase [ADDRESS_1159913] may not receive any therapeutic benefit from participating in an 
investigational study however, by [CONTACT_612412], others will be helped.  All subjects participating in the study will receive physical examinations, various laboratory tests,

5.3.3. Methods to Minimize Risks  
The following steps are incorporated in the protocol to minimize risks to subjects.  
• Subjects will be screened for appro priateness to participate in this study 
• All subjects will be evaluated for safety at monthly visits for one year.  Follow-up visits will be conducted [ADDRESS_1159914] dose of study 
medication.  
• All subjects will be evaluated using the following scales to assess possible worsening of other psychiatric symptoms or other side effects: 
− Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale 
− Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale  
− Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
− Children’s Depression Rating Scale- Revised  
− Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome Quality of Life Scale

evidence that it may be of therapeutic benefit to subjects  with TS.  There is also evidence that it 
is likely to have lower side effect burden  (for movement disorders, extrapyramidal  symptoms, 
tardive dyskinesia, etc., metabolic syndrome and elevated prolactin) than the currently used dopamine antagonists.  The protocol has processes to minimize potential risks from study 
medication that participants  may be exposed to such that risks from the study balance the 
potential benefits.

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is an international, multicenter, open-label, long-term extension study evaluating the safety 
of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835330] (aged ≥ 6 to ≤ 18 years  at Baseline) 
with TS.  Subjects who completed the Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, efficacy and safety study (EBS -101- CL-001) and who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study will be 
eligible to participate in this study.  All subjects will be titrated to a target dose of 2 mg/kg/day as 
participants rolling over from the Phase 2b double-blind efficacy and safety study will be tapered 
off of study medication to maintain the blind from that study.  Subjects will complete study visits  
every month for [ADDRESS_1159916] dose of study medication.  Study Visits may be completed in locations other than clinic 
and/or safety and 
efficacy assessments required at these visits will b e made available for remote administration due to 
restrictions as a consequence of the COVID -19 pandemic or other qualifying event.   
Safety will be monitored throughout the study at every visit by [CONTACT_835356] (AE) monitoring, vital signs, the C olumbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS), the Abnormal 
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) and Children's Depression Rating Scale- Revised (CDRS -R).  In 
addition to these assessments, at Baseline, Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 safety will also be monitored 
by [CONTACT_835360], and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring.  In addition to 
the scales aforementioned, the YGTSS, CGI Tourette Syndrome of Severity (CGI- TS-S), and 
Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome –Quality of Life Scale for Children and Adolescents (C&A -GTS -
QOL)  will also be assessed at Baseline, Months 1, 3, 6, [ADDRESS_1159917] cleared the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be administered ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835331] a target dose of 2 mg/kg/day. 
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
Doses will be adjusted based on the following weight bands to better achieve the 2 mg/kg/day  
target dose: ≥18 to ≤23 kg, >23 to ≤34 kg, >34 to ≤44 kg, >44 to ≤68 kg, >68 to ≤83 kg, >[ADDRESS_1159918] with a new positive response on questions 4 and/or 5 of the C- SSRS will be 
immediately discontinued and evaluated for risk.   Dosing may be restarted at the discretion of the 
Investigator following consultation with the Sponsor or its designee.  
Subjects who discontinue early from the study will be discontinued for one of these primary 
reasons: AE(s), lost to follow-up, subject choice, inadequa te therapeutic effect, and 
administrative/other.   In addition to the primary reason, the subject may have indicated 1 or more 
of these reasons as secondary reasons for discontinuation.  Study disposition information will be 
collected on the case report for m (CRF ).

ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835338] 25 mg/day until off of drug; signs of symptoms of 
withdrawal  will be monitored.  
Subjects with weight changes during the course of the study resulting in change in weight band may titrate to the dosing of the new weight band at the discretion of the Investigator and with the 
approval of the Medical Monitor.  If appr oved, the dose of study medication should be increased 
according to the titration scheme noted for the new weight band.

An ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835339] 2 mg/kg/day  with titration is targeted in pediatric subjects > 6 to 
≤18 years of age at Baseline using the dosage regimen proposed in Table 4.

This dosing regimen was chosen based on modeling and simulation with the results and 
important information summarized below:  
• In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 40 subjects with TS aged 7 to 
17 years  receiving ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835340] 50 mg (if <75 pounds) or 100 mg (if >75 pounds), 
after a titration, a post- hoc analysis  showed that t ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_835341] (Study PSY302); 
• 2 mg/kg targets a mg/kg dose that is above the median mg/kg dose in 75% of subjects in Study PSY302, with the remaining 25% of subjects having a mg/kg dose that is substantially below the 95
th percentile from Study PSY302; 
• The predicted plasma concentration -time curves for the median, 5th percentile, and 95th 
percentile are within the exposures studied in PSY302, and similar to other proposed dosing regimens; 
• The animal:human ratios for the active moieties (unconjugated parent plus active metabolite, SCH40853) are adequate based on the no-observed-adverse- effects -level 
(NOAEL) in the 3 -month GLP toxicology study for mice (30 mg/kg), the 3-month GLP 
toxicology study in rhesus monkeys at 12 mg/kg, and the 1-year GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys at 12 mg/kg, and do not differ from those in Study PSY302 (Table 5).  
• For rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys, the main toxicities observed at 12 mg/kg were 
decreased activity, decreased appetite,  and decreased defecation.  For cynomolgus 
monkeys, these AEs were reported during the first 1 to 3 weeks (hence, the need for 
titration in the proposed clinical study Protocol EBS-101-OL-001). 
• In Study PSY302, the TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., nausea, upper abdominal pain), general disorders and administrative site conditions (e.g., decreased 
appetite, fatigue), and nervous systems disorders (e.g., somnolence, headache, sedation).  
The current study will incorporate a 2-week titration which has the potential to improve tolerability.

Confidential Page 44 of 76 • While studying multiple dose levels is important in a Phase 2b study, a dose titration 
approach (instead of fixed 3-dose parallel design study) was chosen because the PSY302 
study suggested that doses lower than ∼ 1.4 mg/kg the 25th percentile would be unlikely to 
have substantial efficacy.  The exposure between ∼1.4 mg/kg and ∼ 2 mg/kg would have 
significant overlap in exposure (i.e., they would not be distinctly different doses), doses 
higher than ∼ 2 mg/kg may not be well tolerated, and doses higher than ∼ 2 mg/kg would 
result in animal:human exposures significantly lower than 1.

The Investigator (or pharmacist, as appropriate) must maintain records of the delivery of the 
study drug to the study site, the inventory at the site, use for each subject, and return of the study 
drug to a delegate of the Sponsor.  Total study site accountability will be conducted at the end of the study and the Investigator must explain all discrepancies.  
A Drug Dispensing Log must be kept current and should contain the following information:  
• Identification (subject number and initials as required by [CONTACT_427]) of subject to 
whom the study drug was dispensed 
• The dates and lot numbers for the study drug dispensed  
• Initial inventory on receipt of drug at the site  
• Final inventory on completion of the study  
All records and inventory must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_12935] 
(CRA).  
Due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_1159931] be available for monitoring, auditing, or inspection. 
10.8. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
Current ICH Good Clinical Practices (GCP) Guidelines require the Investigator to ensure that study drug deliveries from the Sponsor are received by a responsible person (e.g., pharmacist), and 
• That such deliveries are recorded  
• That study drug is handled and stored safely and properly 
• That study drug is only dispensed to study subjects in accordance with the protocol 
• That any unused study drug is returned to the Sponsor or standard procedures for the 
alternative disposition of unused study drug are followed.

Assessments may be completed in locations other than study clinic and/or via remote 
administration due to restrictions as a consequence of the COVID -19 pandemic or other 
qualifying event. 
11.1 Efficacy Assessments 
The YGTSS, CGI -TS-S, and C&A- GTS -QOL will be assessed at Baseline, Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 
12.  The CGI -TS-I will be assessed at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12. 
The YGTSS is  a clinician -complet ed rating scale  used  to quantify  overall tic severity as  well  as 
specific  subdomains of tic number, frequency, dura tion, intensity, and complexity.  E ach of th ese 
subdomains is s cored, on a 5 -point scale,  separately  for motor  and vocal tics and then summed 
across both motor  and vocal tics to yield a tic severity score ranging from  0 to 50.  The  YGTSS 
also provides for an  overall impairment rating  (0 = ‘‘none’’ to 50 = ‘‘severe’’).   The  YGTSS has 
demonstrated acceptable internal consist ency, good int errater reliability, and accept able 
conve rgent a nd div ergent validity.   Efficacy will be analyzed for both the YGTSS -TTS and 
Global YGTSS.  
The CGI consists  of 2 reliable and valid  7-item Likert  scales  used to assess severity  and 
change in clinical  symptoms.  The  scale ranges  from  1 = “very  much  improved” to 7 = very 
much  worse” for the CGI- TS-I.  The  CGI severity  scale  (CGI- TS-S) will be used at each 
study site visit and ranges  from  1 = “not ill at all” to 7 = “among  the most  extremely  ill.” 
Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome –Quality of Life Scale for Children and Adolescents ( C&A -GTS -
QOL ) is a patient -reported health related quality of life measure developed for children and 
adolescents.   Versions of the scale appropriate for subj ects 6 -12 years of age and 13-18 years of 
age will be provided.  Subjects who turn 13 during the course of the study should continue to be 
assessed using the version of the scale initially administered.

12.1. Safety Parameters  
Study Visits may be completed in locations other than clinic and/or via remote administration due 
to restrictions as a consequence of the COVID -19 pandemic or other qualifying event.  Safety 
will be monitored throughout the study at all  visit s by [CONTACT_835356] (AE) monitoring, 
vital signs, the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS), the Abnormal Involuntary 
Movement Scale (AIMS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS ), the Pediatric Anxiety 
Rating Scale (PARS) and Children's Depression Rating Scale- Revised (CDRS -R).  In addition to 
these assessments, at Baseline, Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 safety will also be monitored by [CONTACT_835363] (ECG) monitoring.  At the Follow Up visit, 
AE monitoring, the C- SSRS, clinical and labor atory evaluations and vital signs will be assessed.  
Laboratory evaluations will include hematology, chemistry, urine values and HbA1c.  A Follow 
Up phone call will be conducted [ADDRESS_1159932] dose of study medication to assess AEs.  
Additional assessment s (all visits  except the follow up visit) will include  the AIMS, the BARS , 
the CDRS -R and the PARS.  C- SSRS will also be assessed (all visits including  the Follow Up 
visit).    
The C-SSRS is  a low burden (approximately 5 minutes  for completion) instrument to  assess both 
suicidal behavior and ideation.  The scale is appropriate for subjects from  age 6 through to  an 
elderly population.  
The AIMS records the occurrences of tardive dyskinesia (TD) in subjects receiving neuroleptic 
medications.  The test is used to detect TD and to follow the severity over time. 
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) scale to assess the severity of drug -induced akathisia.  
Objective and subjective items in the scale measure the level of subject’s restlessness.  
Children's Depression Rating Scale- Revised (CDRS -R) is a clinically  validated  rating  scale 
designed to assess  psychiatric signs and symptoms  of depressions in children and adolescents . 
Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS)  is a clinician -rated instrument for assessing the severity 
of anxiety symptoms associated with common anxiety disorders and generalized anxiety in 
children and adolescents . 
Vital Signs:  
Vital signs will be  collected each clinic visit.  They include heart rate, blood pressure, orthostatic 
blood pressure and heart rate ( after being supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] 5 minutes and 3 minutes after standing), 
height and weight. 
Clinical Laboratory Assessments: 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be  performed  in a fasting state at Baseline, Months 1,

who are sexually active and male subjects who are sexually active must use a highly effective 
form of contraception throughout the study and for [ADDRESS_1159933] a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to the study 
Emalex Biosciences, Inc.   Protocol EBS-101- OL-[ADDRESS_1159934] (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG data, 
physical exami nation) should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets one of the 
following criteria:  
• Induces clinical signs or symptoms 
• Requires active intervention 
• Requires interruption or discontinuation of study medication  
• The abnormality or investigational value is clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_835343], enrolled, before treatment, during 
treatment, or within  [ADDRESS_1159935] be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_13668]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event  
A TEAE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a 
pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered casually related to the product.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE  is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., baseline, treatment, washout, or follow-
up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfils one or 
more of the following: 
• It results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• It results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
All SAEs that occur after any subject has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or 
within [ADDRESS_1159936] b e recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_13668]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Adverse Event  
Other AEs (OAEs) will be identified by [CONTACT_835364], also by [CONTACT_835365] , during the evaluation of safety data for the clinical study report.  
Significant AEs of particular clinical importance, other than SAEs and those AEs leading to 
discontinuation of the subject from the study, will be classified as OAEs.  For each OAE, a 
Emalex Biosciences, Inc.   Protocol EBS-101- OL-[ADDRESS_1159937] (AESI) are listed in Section  13.2.1. 
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE (Unrelated, Possibly Related, or Probably Related).  The 
Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “U nrelated.”  If there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect relationship 
between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “ Related.”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235].  Clinically significant cha nges in laboratory values, blood pressure, and 
pulse rate need not be reported as AEs per the Investigator’s judgement.  However, abnormal 
values that constitute an SAE or lead to discontinuation of administration of study drug must be 
reported and recorded as an AE.  Information about AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form until [ADDRESS_1159938] dose of study drug.  The 
S/AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible.  For each S/ AE, 
the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), 
intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue the study/study treatment. 
Inten sity will be assessed according to the following scale: 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity, 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468] [IP_ADDRESS].  An AE of severe intensity may not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy of a subject or partner occur, it must be reported and recorded on the 
Sponsor or its representatives’ pregnancy form.  Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE 
unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_835344] a contraceptive medication.   Reports of pregnancy must be submitted to Syneos

The outcome of all pregnancies (spontane ous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject  was 
discontinued from the study. 
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs.

Adverse Events:  
AEs, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be documented from the time of the 
first study medication administration from the open label study until the subject’s study 
participation is complete ( study discontinuation and up to 30-days follow-up).  All AEs that 
occur after the first study medication application and up to [ADDRESS_1159942]’s last study 
medication application will be considered TEAEs. 
Each AE will be reported with severity  (mild, moderate, severe) , seriousness, duration, 
resolution, action taken, and its relationship with the study medication  (related or not related) . 
Adverse events will be summarized using system  organ classification (SOC) defined by [CONTACT_3772] (MedDRA); the following AEs will be categorized as 
AESIs in this study (AEs fitting under these categories to be fully described in the SAP): 
• Extrapyramidal reactions (i.e. tardive dyskinesia, akathisia) 
• Metabolic changes (hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], weight gain) 
• Orthostatic hypotension

Emalex Biosciences, Inc.   Protocol EBS-101- OL-[ADDRESS_1159943] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject into the study, a representative of the Sponsor 
will visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Emalex or its representatives .  This will be 
documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Emalex and the Investigator. 
During the study, a monitor from Emalex or its representative will have regular contacts with the investigational site, for the following: 
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s) 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product accountability checks are being performed 
• Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the CRF s 
with the subject ’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records relevant to 
the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for each subject (e.g., clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Emalex. 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on the applicable CRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Emalex  and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the I nvestigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice. 
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Emalex, a regulatory authority, or an IEC/ IRB may visit the site to 
perform audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of an Emalex audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study- related activities  and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, ICH GCP , and any applicable 
regulatory requirements.  The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_835368] a regulatory agency about an inspection.

WMA DECLARATION OF HELSINKI – ETHICAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL 
RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS  
Preamble 
1.         The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research 
on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should 
be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2.         Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human 
subjects to adopt these principles. 
General  Principles  
3.         The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.” 
4.         It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well-being and rights 
of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician’s knowledge 
and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
5.         Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects. 
6.         The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic 
interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be 
evaluated continually through re search for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility 
and quality. 
7.         Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all 
human subjects and protect their health and rights. 
8.         While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal 
can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9.         It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the lif e, 
health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must 
Emalex Biosciences, Inc.   Protocol EBS-101- OL-[ADDRESS_1159952], 
incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating 
subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. 
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post- trial 
provisions. 
Research  Ethics  Committees  
23.       The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This comm ittee 
must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and 
any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws 
and regulations of the country or countries in which the res earch is to be performed as well as 
applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or 
eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
The committee must have the right to monitor o ngoing studies. The researcher must provide 
monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse 
events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by [CONTACT_612421], Inc.   Protocol EBS-101- OL-[ADDRESS_1159953] submit a final report to the committee 
containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. 
Privacy and Confidentiality  
24.       Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the 
confidentiality of their personal information. 
Informed  Consent  
25.       Participation by [CONTACT_54126]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or 
community le aders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a 
research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
26.       In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each 
potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any 
possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits 
and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post-study provisions and any 
other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse 
to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. 
Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential 
subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. 
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or another 
appropriately qualified individual must then seek the pote ntial subject’s freely -given informed 
consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being inform ed about the general 
outcome and results of the study. 
27.       When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must 
be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician 
or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by [CONTACT_612422]. 
28.       For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative. These 
individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them 
unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by [CONTACT_11275], the 
research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and 
the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.  
29.       When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable o f giving informed consent is 
able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that 
Emalex Biosciences, Inc.   Protocol EBS-101- OL-[ADDRESS_1159954]’s 
dissent should be respected. 
30.       Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that 
prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such 
circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised 
representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the 
study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving 
subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in 
the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent 
to remain in the resear ch must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally 
authorised representative.  
31.       The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a stu dy or the patient’s decision to withdraw 
from the study must never adversely affect the patient-physician relationship. 
32.       For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on 
material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed 
consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where 
consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the 
research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee. 
Use of Placebo  
33.       The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested 
against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the followi ng circumstances:  
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or 
Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention  
and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or 
no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of 
not receiving the best proven intervention. 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
Post-Trial  Provisions  
34.       In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should 
make provisions for post- trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified 
as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the 
informed consent process. 
Emalex Biosciences, Inc.   Protocol EBS-101- OL-[ADDRESS_1159955] been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with 
informed consent from the patient or a legally authorised representative, may use an unproven 
intervention if in the physician’s judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or 
alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, 
where appropriate, made publicly available

Confidential Page 69 of 76 CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Grou p’s recommendations related to contraception and 
pregnancy testing in clinical studies include the use of highly effective forms of birth control.  
These methods include the following: 
• Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with the inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal) 
• Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, or implantable)  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing  system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized male partner  
− Vasectomi zed partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that 
partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential study participant and that the vasectomi zed partner has received medical assessment of 
the surgical success.  
• Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of exposure associated with the study treatment). 
− In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective 
method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments.  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

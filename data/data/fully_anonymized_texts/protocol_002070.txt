9. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Overview  
This is a prospective, randomized , single-blinded (subject), two-parallel armed, comparison of 
a single postoperative intravesical instillation of [ADDRESS_996437] -operative UTIs.  
Midurethral sling surgery also increases the risk for UTI compared to a surgery without.  Additionally, 
our planned second site Kaiser Permanente performs relatively more transabdominal prolapse 
repairs than is done at UCSD.  Therefore we plan the following s trata with a 1:1:1:1 allocation 
between the strata: (1) transabdominal prolapse repair with midurethral sling, (2) transabdominal 
prolapse repair without midurethral sling, (3) transvaginal prolapse repair with midurethral sling, and 
(4) transvaginal prolapse repair without midurethral sling.  
 
Study Procedures/Activities  
A woman scheduled to undergo urogynecologic surgery will be informed by [CONTACT_729556]-of -care pre-operative appointment.  At that time, if  the 
patient wishes,  written informed consent will be obtained and the patient will be assigned a study 
identification (ID) number.   On the day of surgery, t he patient will  meet with her surgeon briefly again 
in the pre -operative area to confirmed continued design to participate in the study and to review the 
surgical plan.   Premenopausal subjects  (i.e. last menstrual period less than 1 year ago)  who have not 
previously undergone hysterectomy undergo a urine pregnancy test as part of their standard clinical  
care to assure non -pregnant status on day of surgery. The results of this test will be utilized to 
determine final study eligibility, i.e. those who are determined to be pregnant will be excluded from the study.
  Regardless of study group assignment, the subject will receive pre-operative intravenous 
prophylactic antibiotics, which is the standard of care per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361].   Once the subject is in the 
operating room and has undergone induction of anesthesia and placement of a transurethral catheter 
for clinical care, a urine sample will then be obtained at the start of the case.   A vaginal swab will also 
be obtained.   The process of obtaining these samples will take less than [ADDRESS_996438]’s standard clinical care,  if the patient has not had 
any intraoperative events that exclude her from the study, the surgeon will open the patient’s randomization envelop to determine study arm assignment (to gentamicin or no instillation group). After a final foley catheter is placed, for the subject’s standard clinical c are, another urine sample for 
microbiome analysis will be obtained, as will a vaginal swab for vaginal microbiome analysis.  Then,  if 
the patient is randomized to gentamicin, 80mg of gentamicin in 50 mL of normal saline will be infused 
into the patient’s bladder through the standard -of-care transurethral  catheter by [CONTACT_11065].  The 
surgeon will then clamp the catheter and label the catheter with the clampi[INVESTIGATOR_220580].  If the patient is 
randomized to no instillation, the surgeon will clamp the catheter and label the catheter with the 
clampi[INVESTIGATOR_220580].  The purpose of clampi[INVESTIGATOR_729549].   The subject  will then proceed

After surgery, as is part of routine care, the patients will call the surgeon’s office if they have 
UTI sy mptoms and these calls will be addressed in the usual fashion by [CONTACT_729557].  The patients will give catheterized  urine samples as indicated for UTI symptoms which 
will be processed at a UCSD laboratory.

surgery.

Study Procedures for Obtaining Research Material  
All research material will be stored labeled with subject study ID rather than identifying characteristics.  Al l material will be collected specifically for research purposes  and will not be saved 
for future use after the current study is concluded.  Urine samples will be collected by a transurethral 
catheter placed as part of the subject’s standard clinical care i mmediately before and after the 
surgery while the subject is still under general anesthesia.  Vaginal swabs will be collected at the 
same time.  Other study material will be collected by [CONTACT_729558].  No audio or video recording will be performed as a part of the study.  No questionnaires will be used for the study.
 
 
Data Collection  
An encrypted electronic database will be used to compi[INVESTIGATOR_729551].   All subjects will have a 
unique study ID linked to protec ted health information stored separately in a locked room at WPMC 
only accessible to study personnel. The data will be entered into the database by [CONTACT_40337].   
Baseline subject data will be collected including patient name, medical record number, date of 
birth, telephone call for phone follow up, age, body mass index (BMI), parity, race, ethnicity, prior 
hysterectomy, history of diabetes mellitus, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical 
Status Class, menopausal status, use of hormone replacemen t therapy within [ADDRESS_996446] the following information on an OR Form  
which will be later entered into the d ata base – procedures performed, procedure start and end time, 
number of cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], resident and/or fellow involvement and year of training, estimated blood 
loss, IV antibiotic received pre-operatively and whether or not it was appropriately re- dosed as  
indicated.   These OR forms will be kept in a secured box in the Women’s Pelvic Medicine Center with 
only co -investigators and study staff having access.   The OR forms will be labeled by [CONTACT_40337].  
The following information will be extracted from the patien t’s chart for the post -operative period 
- length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206762], length of initial immediate post -operative catheterization (in days), 
results of initial active voiding trial, need for continued postoperative catheterization after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729552] (and if so -, type of post -operative catheterization [indwelling or intermittent] and duration 
[in days]), post -operative UTI treatment and urine culture result if applicable, patient reports of 
dizziness, tinnitus, hearing loss, or vertigo, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715].  This information will be added 
to the electronic database.   
Results of intraoperative urinary and vaginal microbiome results will also be added to the 
electronic database.  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application 
Page [ADDRESS_996447] we will also monitor for ototoxicity including dizziness, vertigo, 
hearing loss, and tinnitus.   Study investigators will review the study database every 6 months to 
analyze incidence of adverse events.  If there is a 10% or greater incidence of serious adverse event 
among participants (i.e. unan ticipated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]), the research team will meet to discuss 
potential for serious adverse event to be related to intravesicular gentamicin, study modification, or 
termination.    
 
Data Analysis/Interpretation  
           Subjects’ data will be analyzed “as treated” . Preoperative and perioperative variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_729559].  To determine whether any significant baseline differences exist  between 
the study arms, preoperative and perioperative variables of the two study arms will be compared 
using chi -square test for categorical variables or Student t -test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for 
continuous variables.  
The primary outcome of the study, proportion of patients who are clinically treated for UTI , will 
be analyzed with a chi- squared test.  All adverse events will be listed with description of type and 
severity.  The proportion of patients with each type of postoperative adverse event (diarrhea, yeast infection, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729553], and death) in each arm will also be compared 
using a chi-squared test.  Statistical significance will be defined as α<0.05.    
In order to perform our sample size calculation, we first  wante d to baseline postoperative UTI 
rates according to the definition of our primary outcome at our institution. C hart queries were 
performed for all GIVE -IT candidates during 2-month time period (Jan -Feb 2019; N=41) at Kaiser 
San Diego (our FPMRS fellowship sister institution), as it is currently our practice at UCSD (but not at 
Kaiser) to prescribe oral antibiotic prophylaxis following SUI surgery, which could alter UTI rate. The 
UTI rate in this chart query was 17%. To detect a meaningful reduction in UTI from 17% in controls to 8% in intervention group (α  = 0.05, one-tailed) with 80% power (β = 0.2), [ADDRESS_996448] of 50% reduction as a meaningful outcome is derived from the similar effect of oral antibiotic post -operative UTI prophylaxis seen in a similar clinical trial.
3 Accounting for 20% 
dropout or loss to follow- up, we will recruit 200 subjects per arm.   Our benchmark for successful 
recruitment will be approximately 50% recruitment completed [ADDRESS_996449] is 
enrolled.  In order to complete enrollment more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], we anticipate adding Kaiser San Diego as a 
secondary study site.   
All of the patients in the study will be women. Based on a retrospective population -based 
cohort study of 149,554 American women, there was a n 11.1% lifetime risk of undergoing a single 
surgery for prolapse or incontinence by [CONTACT_654] 80.17   In another  population based cohort study  of 2270 
middle- aged and older racially diverse American women (44% white, 20% African American, 18% 
Asian, and 18% Latina or other), 19% of the Latina women, 7% of the Asian women, and 5% of the 
African American women reported bothersome prolapse.18   A study of the same cohort found that 
36% of Hispanic women, 25% of African American women, and 19% of Asian America women 
reported weekly urinary incontinence.19  The study will not specifically recruit or exclude minority 
ethnic groups.   Based on the clinical population at WPMC, approximately 30% of the subjects are 
expected to be Latina, 10% Asian, and 5% African American.

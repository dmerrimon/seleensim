1 Protocol Summary
 
1.1 Synopsis 
Title: Technology and Family Thriving Study (Thrive)  
Grant Number: 2 R42 AG063640-02  Study Description:   Objectives*:  Primary Objective: To test the impact of different forms of technology (virtual reality vs. video chat) on quality of life and family relationships in older adults who reside in senior living communities and an adult child who lives at a distance. The study will also investigate whether responses to the technology and quality of life outcomes depend on older adults' level of cognitive impairment (MCI/ADRD).  Endpoints*:  Primary Endpoint: Quality of life, thriving, mental health, loneliness, family relationships, caregiver guilt  Secondary Endpoints: Social, emotional, physical engagement during technology sessions  Study Population: Older adults (age 50+) with mild cognitive impairments (MCI) or mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease or related dementias (ADRD) who reside in senior living communities and an adult child who lives at a distance.  
Phase* or Stage:  Phase II Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:  Senior living communities in two regions of the U.S. 
Description of Study Intervention/Experimental Manipulation: Dyads (older adult + adult child) will be randomly assigned to participate together in 4 weekly technology sessions using either (a) Virtual Reality (treatment) or (b) Video Chat (active control). 
Study Duration*: Approximately 4 months 
Participant Duration: Approximately 4 months

where
 
the

Lost
 
to
 
follow-up,
 
where
 
participants
 
became
 
unreachable
 
and
 
did
 
not
 
complete
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
follow-up
 
assessments.
  Participants who missed one or more survey assessments but later completed subsequent surveys were 
classified
 
as
 
having
 
intermittent
 
missing
 
data.
 
These
 
cases
 
were
 
not
 
considered
 
lost
 
to
 
follow-up
 
and
 
were
 
retained
 
in
 
all
 
analyses
 
for
 
which
 
valid
 
data
 
were
 
available.
 
Reasons
 
for
 
missed
 
assessments
 
were
 
not
 
always
 
reported
 
but
 
were
 
presumed
 
to
 
reflect
 
temporary
 
nonresponse
 
rather
 
than
 
formal
 
withdrawal
 
or
 
disengagement
 
from
 
the
 
study.
 
In
 
addition,
 
in
 
rare
 
cases,
 
survey
 
data
 
were
 
lost
 
due
 
to
 
administrative
 
or
 
technical
 
errors
 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_58474].
 
These
 
cases
 
were
 
treated
 
as
 
missing
 
(administrative)
 
in
 
the
 
relevant
 
analyses.

2 Introduction
 
2.1 Study Rationale 
By
 
2030,
 
it
 
is
 
estimated
 
that
 
over
 
20%
 
of
 
U.S.
 
residents
 
will
 
be
 
age
 
60
 
or
 
older1
 
.
 
Since
 
people
 
are
 
living
 
longer,
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
people
 
with
 
Alzheimer’s
 
disease
 
(AD)
 
and
 
Alzheimer’s
 
disease-related-dementias
 
(ADRD)
 
is
 
expanding
 
exponentially,
 
affecting
 
approximately
 
5.4
 
million
 
Americans.

As
 
noted
 
in
 
the
 
strategic
 
directions
 
of
 
the
 
National
 
Institute
 
on
 
Aging
 
(NIA;
 
Goal
 
C),
 
scientists
 
have
 
made
 
remarkable
 
breakthroughs
 
in
 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_58475].
 
But
 
now,
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
ensure
 
quality
 
of
 
life.
 
Until
 
cures
 
for
 
the
 
dementias
 
are
 
discovered,
 
new
 
technologies
 
and
 
interventions
 
that
 
can
 
reduce
 
the
 
stress
 
and
 
emotional
 
burden
 
of
 
AD/ADRD
 
for
 
older
 
adults
 
and
 
their
 
family
 
members
 
(NIA’s
 
SBA-Approved
 
SBIR/STTR
 
Priority
 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102])
 
are
 
imperative.
 
Virtual
 
reality
 
(VR)
 
is
 
an
 
innovative,
 
noninvasive,
 
drug-free,
 
and
 
increasingly
 
affordable
 
tool
 
that
 
can
 
help
 
older
 
adults
 
and
 
their
 
family
 
members
 
manage
 
the
 
anxiety,
 
stress,
 
and
 
feelings
 
of
 
isolation
 
associated
 
with
 
dementia,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
promote
 
thriving.
 
In
 
addition,
 
adult
 
children
 
increasingly
 
do
 
not
 
live
 
near
 
their
 
parents
 
and
 
are
 
managing
 
dual
 
career
 
families
 
of
 
their
 
own,
 
making
 
it
 
incredibly
 
difficult
 
to
 
provide
 
care
 
from
 
a
 
distance.

Research
 
shows
 
that
 
adult
 
children
 
who

like
 
their
 
caregiving
 
is
 
inadequate.
3
 
These
 
experiences
 
are
 
even
 
more
 
difficult
 
when
 
their
 
loved
 
one
 
has
 
dementia
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
relentless,
 
heartbreaking
 
loss
 
of
 
the
 
person
 
they
 
used
 
to
 
know—the
 
loss
 
of
 
memories,
 
ability
 
to
 
learn,
 
and
 
identity.
 
COVID-[ADDRESS_63736].
 
Technologies
 
are
 
critically
 
needed
 
to
 
combat
 
these
 
adverse
 
effects.
  Rendever, with its innovative virtual reality (VR) platform, provides a solution to the unprecedented 
challenges
 
of
 
residents’
 
feelings
 
of
 
social
 
isolation,
 
enabling
 
and
 
enhancing
 
social
 
connections
 
with
 
family
 
even
 
when
 
physical
 
contact
 
[CONTACT_58510].
 
Rendever’s
 
advanced
 
communication
 
and
 
networking
 
technology
 
allows
 
multiple
 
people
 
to
 
travel
 
in
 
VR,
 
co-view
 
photos
 
and
 
videos,
 
and
 
engage
 
in
 
novel
 
activities
 
together,
 
all
 
while
 
sharing
 
stories
 
in
 
the
 
process,
 
even
 
if
 
they
 
live
 
in
 
different
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
world.
 
Our
 
Phase
 
I
 
data
 
indicate
 
that
 
Rendever
 
is
 
safe,
 
easy
 
to
 
use,
 
and
 
transformative
 
for
 
residents
 
and
 
family
 
members.
 
In
 
the
 
pages
 
below,
 
we
 
outline
 
the
 
positive
 
impact
 
Rendever
 
has
 
on
 
residents’
 
and
 
family
 
members’
 
mental
 
and
 
relational
 
health.
 
Our

and
 
that
 
they
 
loved
 
using
 
it,
 
regardless
 
of
 
their
 
level
 
of
 
cognitive
 
impairment.
 
Given
 
the
 
strong
 
evidence
 
of
 
the
 
feasibility
 
and
 
technological
 
merit
 
of
 
Rendever
 
from
 
Phase
 
I,
 
we
 
are
 
pursuing
 
Phase
 
II
 
with
 
the
 
goal
 
of
 
continuing
 
the
 
research
 
and
 
improving
 
the
 
efficacy
 
of
 
the
 
long-distance
 
features
 
of
 
Rendever
 
with

several
 
important
 
ways:
 
(1)
 
expanding

to
 
test
 
the

of

on
 
a

(2)
 
adding
 
an

(video

to
 
provide
 
a
 
rigorous

of
 
the

of

and
 
to

to
 
determine
 
if
 
the
 
potential

over

and
 
(4)

to
 
include
 
a

  Phase II: VR as a Relationship Maintenance Tool with Residents with Cognitive Impairments  Largely due to the lack of disease-changing treatments for AD/ADRD, there has been growing interest in

A
 
key
 
question
 
is:
 
what
 
does
 
VR
 
offer
 
beyond
 
what
 
is
 
already
 
available
 
in
 
these
 
existing
 
approaches?
 
 In this project, VR is viewed as a relationship maintenance mechanism that promotes positive 
engagement.
 
We
 
conceptualize
 
positive
 
engagement
 
as
 
emotional
 
connections
 
between
 
the
 
resident
 
and
 
adult
 
child,
 
engagement
 
in
 
conversations
 
with
 
each
 
other
 
while
 
in
 
the
 
VR,
 
engagement
 
in
 
the
 
technology
 
itself,
 
and
 
positive
 
affect
 
(e.g.,
 
joy,
 
excitement).
9
 
We
 
rely
 
on
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
tenants
 
of
 
the
  NIH Protocol Templa te for Beha vioral and Social Sciences Resear ch Involving Humans – v4.0 2018-12-12 7  
 Technology and Family Thriving Study (Thriv e) Version 1.0 Protocol NIH 13336607 16 March 2025  theory of resilience and relational load (TRRL) to explain why VR, as a relationship maintenance tool, 
fosters
 
positive
 
engagement.
 
As
 
the
 
TRRL
 
and
 
other
 
theories
 
(e.g.,
 
attachment
 
theory)
 
suggest,
 
people
 
want
 
to
 
feel
 
loved,
 
secure,
 
and
 
valued.
10
 
11
 
These
 
feelings
 
occur
 
across
 
the
 
lifespan,
 
but
 
are
 
especially
 
salient
 
at
 
the

argues
 
that
 
investing
 
in

builds

when
 
they

Positive
 
relationship
 
maintenance
 
involves
 
the
 
“prosocial,

experiences,

When

they
 
also

However,
 
VR
 
is
 
different
 
than
 
these

because
 
of
 
the
 
immersion

rather
 
than
 
simply

  Virtual worlds can also create a feeling of security for residents with dementia, who are anxious without

Social

is
 
a
 
“sense
 
of

in
 
a
 
virtual
 
environment.
19
 
It
 
allows
 
people
 
to
 
transcend
 
their
 
location
 
in
 
space
 
and
 
feel
 
as
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
with
 
each

Virtual

activates
 
the

in
 
the

when
 
people
 
are

A
 
component
 
of
 
social
 
presence
 
is
 
co-presence

“the

to
 
which

things
 
they
 
can

Because
 
of
 
the

Rendever
 
should
 
be
 
more

to
 
other
 
means,
 
such
 
as

In
 
Phase
 
II,
 
we
 
also
 
want
 
to
 
show
 
that
 
using
 
Rendever
 
has
 
a
 
longer-term
 
impact
 
beyond
 
the

might
 
not

that
 
last

Therefore,
 
our
 
first
 
aim
 
and
 
hypotheses
 
are:
 
 
 AIM1: Determine whether Rendever (vs. control) improves quality of life for residents and their adult 
children
 
who
 
live
 
at

:
 
Residents

(vs.

will
 
show
 
significantly
 
greater
 
improvements
 
in
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
(reductions
 
in
 
loneliness,
 
improvements
 
in
 
mental
 
health
 
and
 
thriving)
 
both
 
concurrently
 
and
 
over
 
time
 
(relative
 
to
 
baseline).
 
 
●
 
H1b:
 
The
 
positive
 
effects
 
of
 
the
 
VR
 
condition
 
(vs.

on
 
residents’
 
and
 
adult
 
children’s
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
will
 
be
 
mediated
 
by
 
(explained

increases
 
in
 
positive
 
engagement

while

emotional
 
closeness
 
with
 
the

A second aim of Phase II is to continue to determine the level of cognitive impairment for which 
Rendever
 
is
 
most
 
beneficial.
 
Virtual
 
reality
 
has
 
been
 
used
 
successfully
 
with
 
older
 
adults
 
with
 
MCI
 
and
 
mild
 
to
 
moderate
 
AD/ADRD
 
to
 
enhance
 
cognition,
 
navigation,
 
spatial
 
orientation,
 
attention,
 
spatial
 
memory,
 
mobility,
 
and
 
balance.
 
Research
 
with
 
residents
 
with
 
and
 
without
 
dementia
 
suggests
 
that
 
VR
 
is
 
enjoyable
 
and
 
can
 
induce
 
positive
 
affect.
 
For
 
instance,
 
virtual
 
environments
 
have
 
been
 
found
 
to
 
increase
 
joy
 
and
 
relaxation
 
in
 
residents
 
and
 
reduce
 
anxiety
 
and
 
sadness.

,
 
particularly
 
among
 
residents
 
with
 
dementia.
 
What
 
has
 
been
 
missing
 
from
 
VR
 
is
 
sophisticated
 
networking
 
and
 
livestreaming
 
functions,
 
which
 
Rendever
 
provides.
 
The
 
ability
 
for
 
residents
 
to
 
travel
 
back
 
in
 
time
 
to
 
their
 
childhood
 
home
 
and
 
other
 
memorable
 
places
 
with
 
their
 
adult
 
child
 
while
 
sharing
 
stories
 
together
 
should
 
facilitate
 
positive
 
engagement
 
for
 
both
 
of
 
them.
 
  We already demonstrated in Phase I that Rendever can be used safely with residents with MCI and mild 
to
 
moderate
 
AD/ADRD
 
and
 
that
 
residents
 
loved
 
the
 
experience,
 
regardless
 
of
 
their
 
level
 
of
 
cognitive
 
impairment.
 
Our
 
Phase
 
I
 
results
 
suggest
 
that
 
Rendever
 
is
 
beneficial
 
for
 
residents
 
with
 
MCI
 
and
 
mild
 
to
 
moderate
 
dementia,
 
especially
 
if
 
it
 
involves
 
reminiscence
 
therapy.
 
We
 
also
 
found
 
in
 
our
 
automated
 
and
 
human
 
coding
 
that
 
the
 
higher
 
the
 
MMSE-2
 
score
 
(or
 
the
 
less
 
dementia),
 
the
 
more
 
engaged

residents’
 
bodily
 
movements.
 
However,
 
dementia
 
might
 
enable
 
residents
 
to
 
become
 
more
 
immersed
 
in
 
another
 
world
 
than
 
if
 
they
 
have
 
MCI.
 
These
 
speculations
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
tested
 
with
 
a
 
larger
 
sample
 
in
 
Phase
 
II.
 
We
 
also
 
did
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
large
 
enough
 
sample
 
to
 
test
 
for
 
differences
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
groups
 
for
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
indices.
 
Therefore,
 
research
 
questions
 
are
 
posed
 
instead
 
of
 
hypotheses.
 
Phase
 
II
 
extends
 
the
 
literature
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58514]’
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
depends
 
on
 
their
 
level
 
of
 
cognitive
 
impairment,
 
primarily
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
engagement.
 
Likewise,
 
the
 
adult
 
child’s
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
might
 
also
 
improve
 
because
 
of
 
jointly
 
benefiting
 
from
 
engagement
 
in
 
the
 
VR
 
with
 
one’s
 
parent.
 
Finally,
 
Rendever
 
should
 
produce
 
greater
 
engagement
 
than
 
video
 
chat
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
shared
 
immersion
 
into
 
an
 
altered
 
reality.
 
Therefore,
 
our
 
second
 
aim
 
and
 
research
 
questions
 
are:
  AIM2: Determine whether the positive effects of Rendever (vs. control) on residents’  and their adult children’s quality of life depends upon residents’ level of cognitive impairment (MCI vs. 
mild
 
to
 
moderate
 
AD/ADRD).

level
 
of
 
cognitive

(MCI

concurrently
 
and

differences
 
in

Finally, having parents move into a senior living community can be stressful and anxiety-producing for 
adult
 
children.
 
We
 
focus
 
on
 
residents
 
of
 
senior
 
living
 
communities
 
and
 
their
 
adult
 
children
 
living
 
at
 
a
 
distance
 
because
 
the
 
distance
 
can
 
make
 
it
 
challenging
 
to
 
maintain
 
their
 
relationship
 
and
 
difficult
 
for
 
the
 
adult
 
children
 
to
 
feel
 
like
 
they
 
have
 
control
 
over
 
the
 
quality
 
of

Adult
 
children

To

and
 
ease
 
the
 
concerns
 
of
 
the

it
 
is
 
essential
 
that
 
the
 
senior
 
living
 
community
 
involve
 
the
 
adult
 
child
 
in
 
the
 
parent’s
 
care
 
and
 
provide
 
programming
 
that
 
allows
 
residents
 
to
 
experience
 
a
 
high
 
quality
 
of
 
life.
 
The
 
synergy
 
that
 
is
 
created
 
through
 
the
 
shared
 
VR
 
experiences
 
should
 
reduce
 
caregiver
 
guilt
 
for
 
the
 
adult
 
child
 
not
 
only
 
because
 
the
 
child
 
is
 
engaged
 
in
 
the
 
VR
 
with
 
their
 
parent,
 
but
 
also
 
because
 
they
 
see

the
 
positive
 
effects
 
that
 
it
 
has
 
on
 
their
 
parent’s
 
engagement
 
over
 
time.
 
Thus,
 
our
 
final
 
aim
 
and
 
hypotheses
 
are
 
posed:
  AIM3: Determine whether Rendever (vs. control) reduces caregiver guilt for adult children who live at a 
distance,
 
and
 
whether
 
these
 
effects
 
depend
 
on
 
the
 
adult
 
child’s
 
own
 
response
 
to
 
the

and
 
their
 
parent’s
 
response
 
to

older
 
adults
 
and
 
the
 
family
 
members
 
who
 
love
 
and
 
care
 
for
 
them.
 
New
 
technologies
 
are
 
essential
 
that
 
can
 
reduce
 
the
 
caregiver
 
burden
 
of
 
AD/ADRD
 
(NIA’s
 
strategic
 
plan).
 
Before
 
COVID-19,
 
family
 
members
 
were
 
already
 
concerned
 
about
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
care
 
provided
 
for
 
their
 
loved
 
one
 
with
 
dementia
 
in
 
senior
 
living
 
communities
 
and
 
these
 
concerns
 
have
 
been
 
amplified
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58517].
 
The
 
virtual
 
reality
 
(VR)
 
program,
 
Rendever,
 
provides
 
an
 
innovative
 
and
 
affordable
 
solution
 
to
 
these
 
challenges
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58518],
 
engage
 
fully
 
with
 
life,
 
and
 
reconnect
 
with
 
their
 
past,
 
regardless
 
of
 
physical
 
location,
 
through
 
its
 
advanced
 
networking
 
and
 
live
 
streaming
 
capabilities.
 
There
 
is
 
neurological,
 
behavioral,
 
and
 
physiological
 
evidence
 
that
 
virtual
 
environments
 
allow
 
people
 
to
 
feel
 
the
 
emotional
 
presence
 
of
 
others
 
in
 
ways
 
that
 
surpass
 
their
 
location
 
in
 
space.
 
Unfortunately,
 
little
 
research
 
has
 
examined
 
VR’s
 
impact
 
on
 
older
 
adults’
 
social
 
relationships,
 
primarily
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
networking
 
and
 
communication
 
capabilities
 
of
 
other
 
VR
 
programs. 
   In our Phase I study, we tested the feasibility of Rendever with residents with mild cognitive impairments 
(MCI)
 
or
 
mild
 
to
 
moderate
 
dementia
 
and
 
their
 
family
 
members
 
who
 
lived
 
at
 
a
 
distance.
 
Our
 
metrics
 
for
 
both
 
Aims
 
were
 
exceeded.
 
Data
 
collected
 
with
 
21
 
family
 
dyads
 
showed
 
Rendever
 
to
 
be
 
safe,
 
easy
 
to
 
use,
 
and
 
transformative
 
for
 
the
 
families.
 
Residents
 
and
 
their
 
family
 
members
 
reported
 
extremely
 
high
 
user
 
satisfaction,
 
enjoyment,
 
and
 
immersion.
 
Rendever
 
also
 
significantly
 
reduced
 
residents’
 
feelings
 
of
 
isolation,
 
increased
 
positive
 
affect,
 
decreased
 
negative
 
affect,
 
increased
 
quality
 
of
 
life,
 
and
 
improved
 
emotional
 
closeness
 
with
 
family
 
members
 
over
 
time
 
compared
 
to
 
baseline.
 
In
 
addition,
 
it
 
significantly
 
improved
 
mental
 
health
 
and
 
reduced
 
negative
 
affect
 
and
 
caregiver
 
guilt
 
for
 
the
 
family
 
member
 
over
 
time
 
compared
 
to
 
baseline.
 
Residents
 
with
 
MCI
 
and
 
mild
 
to
 
moderate
 
dementia
 
also
 
equally
 
enjoyed
 
the
 
VR.
 
In
 
Phase
 
II
 
(the
 
current
 
project
 
described),
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
refine
 
the
 
long-distance
 
features
 
of
 
Rendever,

We
 
also

2.3.1 Known Potential Risks 
Risks to psychological well-being:  Although the VR activities are designed to be pleasant and enjoyable, 
there
 
is
 
a
 
chance
 
that
 
participants
 
will
 
experience
 
emotional
 
distress
 
(sadness,
 
regret)
 
when
 
participating
 
in
 
some
 
of
 
them.
 
For
 
example,
 
some
 
residents
 
who
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
“Life
 
Story”
 
activity
 
might
 
feel
 
distressed
 
if
 
the
 
activity
 
makes
 
them
 
think
 
about
 
past
 
memories
 
that
 
are
 
painful
 
or
 
negative.
 
Looking
 
at
 
family
 
photos
 
through
 
the
 
VR
 
could
 
also
 
make
 
residents
 
think
 
about
 
their
 
mortality,
 
the
 
passing
 
of
 
a
 
spouse,
 
missed
 
opportunities
 
with
 
their
 
family,
 
and
 
conflicted
 
aspects
 
about
 
their
 
relationships.
 
They
 
might
 
also
 
feel
 
frustrated
 
if
 
they
 
cannot
 
remember
 
the
 
names
 
of
 
people
 
or
 
things
 
in
 
photos.
 
In
 
addition,
 
family
 
members
 
may
 
feel
 
sad
 
when
 
thinking
 
about
 
how
 
their
 
relationship
 
with
 
their
 
loved
 
one
 
has
 
changed
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
dementia
 
or
 
the
 
passage
 
of
 
time.
 
In
 
addition,
 
although
 
the
 
Rendever
 
platform
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
increase
 
social
 
engagement
 
and
 
connection,
 
difficult
 
family
 
dynamics
 
may
 
take
 
place
 
if
 
residents
 
and
 
their
 
family
 
members
 
behave
 
in
 
a
 
distant
 
or
 
unsupportive
 
manner
 
during
 
the
 
VR
 
activities.
 
Based
 
on
 
previous
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58479]
 
1
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58480],
 
these
 
experiences
 
will
 
likely
 
be
 
rare
 
and
 
mild
 
in
 
severity. 
  In the Phase 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], which included 21 resident-family dyads (42 individuals) and 63 VR sessions, 
there
 
were
 
minimal
 
reports
 
of
 
psychological
 
discomfort.
 
There
 
were
 
no
 
instances
 
of
 
negative
 
emotional
 
distress,
 
anger,
 
or
 
negative
 
interpersonal
 
dynamics
 
between
 
family
 
members.
 
When
 
residents
 
were
 
asked
 
if
 
the
 
VR
 
session
 
made
 
them
 
anxious,
 
57
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
63
 
times
 
they
 
said
 
“not
 
at
 
all”.
 
When
 
asked
 
if
 
the
 
VR
 
session
 
made
 
them
 
tired,
 
56
 
out
 
of
 
63
 
times
 
they
 
said
 
“not
 
at
 
all,”
 
and
 
when
 
asked
 
to
 
rate
 
how
 
“secure”
 
they
 
felt
 
during
 
the
 
VR
 
session,
 
their
 
mean
 
rating
 
was
 
9.1
 
on
 
a
 
10-point
 
scale
 
(10
 
indicating
 
“completely
 
secure”).
 
In
 
no
 
case
 
did
 
a
 
session
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
interrupted
 
or
 
suspended
 
due
 
to
 
emotional
 
or
 
social
 
distress,
 
and
 
in
 
no
 
case
 
did
 
a
 
resident
 
(or
 
family
 
member)
 
request
 
to
 
end
 
a
 
session.
 
Residents
 
and
 
family
 
members
 
greatly
 
enjoyed
 
the
 
VR
 
sessions,
 
and
 
many
 
wanted
 
to
 
continue
 
the
 
sessions
 
beyond
 
the
 
15
 
minutes
 
scheduled.
 
They
 
also
 
wished
 
there
 
were
 
more
 
sessions
 
and
 
many
 
residents
 
asked
 
if
 
they
 
could
 
do
 
the
 
study
 
over
 
again
 
with
 
another
 
family
 
member.
 
Sessions
 
where
 
residents
 
traveled
 
back
 
to
 
their
 
childhood
 
home
 
and
 
other
 
memorable
 
locations
 
(“Life
 
Story”)
 
lasted
 
anywhere
 
from
 
[ADDRESS_63747].
 
Nevertheless,
 
because
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
vulnerable
 
population,
 
careful
 
safeguards
 
(described
 
below)
 
will
 
be
 
in
 
place
 
to
 
minimize
 
and
 
mitigate
 
these
 
risks,
 
and
 
any
 
adverse
 
psychological
 
responses
 
will
 
be
 
managed
 
with
 
the
 
utmost
 
care
 
and
 
respect
 
for
 
residents
 
and
 
family
 
members.  
  Risks to confidentiality:  Participants may be uncomfortable sharing personal information with 
researchers
 
or
 
being
 
videotaped
 
for
 
research
 
purposes.
 
In
 
addition,
 
although
 
all
 
research
 
data
 
will
 
be
 
carefully
 
safeguarded
 
(and
 
identified
 
only
 
by
 
a
 
random
 
family
 
code),
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
small
 
risk
 
(as
 
with
 
any
 
digitally
 
stored
 
data)
 
that
 
data
 
security
 
will
 
be
 
breached
 
and
 
personally
 
identifiable
 
information
 
could
 
be
 
obtained
 
by
 
[CONTACT_105]-research
 
personnel. 
  
 NIH Protocol Templa te for Beha vioral and Social Sciences Resear ch Involving Humans – v4.0 2018-12-12 12  
 Technology and Family Thriving Study (Thriv e) Version 1.0 Protocol NIH 13336607 16 March 2025  Risks to autonomy:  Participants may feel pressured to join the study (or remain in the study) so that 
they
 
do
 
not
 
disappoint
 
the
 
researchers
 
or
 
their
 
family
 
members.
 
In
 
addition,
 
although
 
the
 
consent
 
process
 
will
 
take
 
place
 
with
 
very
 
careful
 
safeguards,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
small
 
risk
 
that
 
participants
 
with
 
cognitive
 
impairment
 
may
 
not
 
fully
 
understand
 
the
 
study
 
procedures
 
or
 
associated
 
risks.
 
Careful
 
safeguards
 
will
 
be
 
in
 
place
 
to
 
minimize
 
these
 
risks.  
  Risks to physical safety:  The VR activities pose some mild risk to the participants’ physical safety, 
particularly
 
the
 
older
 
adults. 
 
One
 
potential
 
risk
 
is
 
experiencing
 
dizziness
 
and
 
nausea
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
the
 
VR
 
experiences.
 
Because
 
some
 
participants
 
have
 
dementia,
 
they
 
could
 
be
 
at
 
risk
 
of
 
experiencing
 
hallucinations
 
or
 
becoming
 
aggressive
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
the
 
VR.
 
There
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
risk
 
of
 
mild
 
skin
 
irritation
 
around
 
the
 
eyes
 
and
 
nose
 
caused
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58519].
 
Finally,
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
current
 
COVID-[ADDRESS_63748]
 
to
 
minimize
 
and
 
mitigate
 
these
 
risks. 
 
In
 
the
 
Phase
 
I
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58480]
,
 
which
 
included
 
63
 
VR
 
sessions,
 
there
 
were
 
no
 
instances
 
of
 
hallucinations
 
or
 
aggression,
 
and
 
no
 
instances
 
of
 
physical
 
instability
 
following
 
the
 
VR
 
sessions. 
 
Of
 
the
 
63
 
sessions,
 
57
 
reported
 
“no
 
nausea
 
at
 
all,”
 
and
 
the
 
remaining
 
cases
 
reported
 
only
 
mild
 
nausea
 
(mostly
 
during
 
the
 
first
 
session
 
when
 
the
 
VR
 
experience
 
was
 
new). 
 
In
 
addition,
 
of
 
the
 
63
 
sessions,
 
“no
 
discomfort
 
at
 
all”
 
was
 
reported
 
in
 
54
 
of
 
them,
 
and
 
“no
 
eye
 
irritation
 
at
 
all”
 
was
 
reported
 
in
 
[ADDRESS_63749] of the Rendever platform (vs. video chat). We 
hope
 
that
 
participants
 
will
 
experience
 
personal
 
and
 
relational
 
benefits
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
their
 
participation. 
   Personal benefits: Senior residents in this study may experience improvements in emotional well-being, 
including
 
increases
 
in
 
positive
 
emotion,
 
subjective
 
vitality,
 
and
 
meaning
 
in
 
life.
 
Residents
 
often
 
lack
 
opportunities
 
for
 
exploration
 
and
 
novelty,
 
especially
 
for
 
those
 
with
 
limited
 
mobility
 
and
 
cognitive
 
impairments.
 
By
 
[CONTACT_58520],
 
residents
 
will
 
have
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
engage
 
in
 
novel
 
and
 
emotionally
 
meaningful
 
activities
 
that
 
are
 
socially
 
shared,
 
even
 
while
 
they
 
are
 
physically
 
separated
 
from
 
loved
 
ones. 
 
Family
 
members
 
may
 
also
 
benefit
 
in
 
numerous
 
ways. 
 
By
 
[CONTACT_58521],
 
they
 
may
 
experience
 
reductions
 
in
 
stress
 
and
 
worry
 
about
 
them,
 
or
 
guilt
 
about
 
not
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
see
 
them
 
in
 
person.
 
The
 
VR
 
activities
 
will
 
enable
 
family
 
members
 
to
 
interact
 
with
 
their
 
loved
 
ones
 
remotely,
 
but
 
in
 
a
 
positive
 
and
 
emotionally
 
meaningful
 
way.
 
Finally,
 
participants
 
may
 
experience
 
feelings
 
of
 
satisfaction
 
associated
 
with
 
their
 
contribution
 
to
 
scientific
 
research
 
on
 
healthy
 
aging,
 
and
 
as
 
a
 
function
 
of
 
building
 
a
 
familiar
 
and
 
caring
 
relationship
 
with
 
research
 
staff.  
   Relational benefits:  Residents and family members may experience improvements in their relationships 
with
 
each
 
other,
 
including
 
increases
 
in
 
intimacy,
 
emotional
 
closeness,
 
social
 
support,
 
and
 
healthy
 
communication.
 
Participants
 
will
 
have
 
structured
 
opportunities
 
for
 
social
 
connection
 
for
 
4
 
consecutive
 
weeks.
 
This
 
may
 
allow
 
residents
 
and
 
family
 
members
 
to
 
engage
 
in
 
positive
 
activities
 
that
 
build
 
emotional

The
 
VR/Zoom
 
activities
 
are
 
designed
 
to
 
be

the

will
 
provide
 
an
 
essential,

test
 
of
 
the
 
usability,
 
technological
 
merit,
 
and
 
impact
 
of
 
Rendever
 
in
 
this
 
population.
 
   The knowledge gained from this Phase II study will be a vital step toward determining if Rendever can be 
used
 
effectively
 
with
 
residents
 
with
 
dementia
 
and
 
remotely
 
with
 
both

to

technology
 
currently
 
available
 
(i.e.,

It
 
will
 
also
 
provide
 
a
 
much-needed
 
test
 
of
 
Rendever’s
 
software
 
and
 
remote
 
networking
 
capabilities.
 
Finally,
 
because
 
little
 
research
 
has
 
implemented
 
VR
 
with
 
residents
 
with
 
MCI
 
and
 
dementia
 
in
 
the

this

will
 
provide
 
critical

about
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
cognitive

for
 
which
 
VR/Rendever
 
might
 
be
 
best

If

will
 
be
 
wearing
 
the

which
 
they
 
often
 
did
 
in

4.1 Overall Design 
Purpose of the clinical trial: The virtual reality (VR) program, Rendever, enables older adults in senior 
living
 
communities
 
to
 
maintain
 
important
 
family
 
relationships,
 
engage
 
fully

Residents 
 
and
 
adult
 
children
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
interviewed
 
briefly
 
after
 
the
 
final

In
 
addition,
 
audiotapes
 
will
 
be
 
transcribed
 
and
 
subjected
 
to

to
 
assess

(16
 
dyads
 
per

Half
 
the

(n
 
=

will
 
be
 
located
 
in

A
 
power
 
analysis
 
using
 
simulation
 
methods
 
(for
 
multilevel
 
regression
 
models
 
and
 
structural
 
equation
 
models)
 
was
 
used
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
sample
 
size.
 
Whenever
 
possible,
 
effect
 
sizes
 
were
 
estimated
 
from
 
the
 
Phase
 
I
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58491].
 
The
 
attrition
 
rate
 
was
 
assumed
 
to
 
be
 
approximately
 
15%
 
across
 
the
 
4-
 
month
 
longitudinal
 
study.
 
The
 
results
 
of
 
the
 
simulation
 
study
 
reveal
 
that
 
a
 
sample
 
size
 
of
 
192
 
dyads
 
(96
 
in

condition,
 
96
 
in
 
control)
 
evenly
 
split
 
between
 
cognitive
 
impairment
 
groups
 
(MCI
 
vs.

will
 
achieve
 
a
 
high
 
level
 
of
 
power
 
(.85)
 
for
 
detecting
 
the
 
minimal

(conceptualized
 
as
 
effect
 
size
 
of
 
d=.2)
 
across
 
the
 
different
 
analytic
 
approaches
 
considered.
 
This
 
sample
 
size
 
will
 
provide
 
high
 
power
 
(85%)
 
for
 
detecting
 
even
 
relatively
 
small
 
effects
 
of
 
the

and
 
excellent
 
power
 
for
 
detecting
 
even
 
larger
 
effects,
 
which
 
are
 
anticipated.  
   Statistical analysis: Because data from resident-adult child dyads is dependent, and because the dyad is 
the
 
unit
 
of
 
analysis
 
for
 
assignment
 
to
 
experimental
 
conditions,
 
the
 
analysis
 
of
 
quantitative

will

4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
 
A key question we aim to address in this study is what unique benefits VR– specifically, Rendever’s VR– 
provides
 
beyond
 
existing
 
methods
 
for
 
enhancing
 
connection
 
across
 
distances,
 
reducing
 
loneliness,
 
and
 
improving
 
well-being.
 
Given
 
the
 
widespread
 
adoption
 
of
 
video
 
conferences,
 
particularly
 
during
 
the
 
COVID-19
 
lockdowns,
 
we
 
selected
 
Zoom
 
as
 
an
 
active
 
control
 
condition.
 
Video
 
calls
 
represent
 
a
 
commonly
 
used,
 
accessible
 
intervention
 
for
 
combating
 
loneliness,
 
making
 
Zoom
 
an
 
appropriate
 
benchmark
 
for
 
comparison.
 
THis
 
allows
 
us
 
to
 
isolate
 
the
 
specific
 
contributions
 
of
 
VR
 
–such
 
as
 
increased
 
immersion,
 
presence,
 
and
 
engagement–while
 
ensuring
 
that
 
all
 
participants
 
receive
 
some
 
form
 
of
 
social
 
interaction.
 
However,
 
we
 
acknowledge
 
potential
 
limitations
 
of
 
this
 
control,
 
including
 
differences
 
in
 
ease
 
of
 
use
 
for
 
the
 
family
 
member,
 
technological
 
familiarity,
 
and
 
the
 
extent
 
to
 
which
 
each
 
method
 
fosters
 
meaningful
 
social
 
experiences.
 
  
4.3 Justification for Intervention
 
The selected mode of intervention delivery–weekly ~20-minute VR sessions– was informed by [CONTACT_58527]
 
I
 
study,
 
which
 
demonstrated
 
feasibility
 
and
 
positive
 
engagements
 
with
 
this
 
schedule.
 
Limiting
 
sessions
 
to
 
approximately
 
[ADDRESS_63763]
 
sufficient
 
time
 
to
 
meaningfully
 
engage
 
with
 
the
 
experience. 
   This intervention schedule strikes a balance between collecting valuable data and minimizing participant 
burden,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
study
 
participation
 
remains
 
accessible
 
and
 
manageable.
 
The
 
structured
 
weekly
 
sessions,
 
each
 
featuring
 
a
 
different
 
activity
 
showcasing
 
Rendever’s
 
VR
 
product
 
offerings,
 
allow
 
us
 
to

 Technology and Family Thriving Study (Thriv e) Version 1.[ADDRESS_63764] 3 of the 4 sessions, 
ensuring
 
adequate
 
exposure
 
to
 
the
 
intervention
 
for
 
meaningful
 
analysis.
 
This
 
threshold
 
accounts
 
for
 
expected
 
variability
 
in
 
participation,
 
such
 
as

5.5 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention 
Planned distribution of subjects by [CONTACT_4321]/gender, race, and ethnicity: Participants will be 192 resident-adult child dyads recruited from 12 senior living communities 
(approximately
 
16
 
dyads
 
per
 
community).
 
Half
 
of
 
the
 
residents
 
(age
 
50+)
 
will
 
have
 
mild
 
cognitive
 
impairment
 
(MCI)
 
and
 
half
 
will
 
have
 
mild
 
to
 
moderate
 
Alzheimer’s
 
disease
 
and
 
Alzheimer’s
 
disease
 
related
 
dementias
 
(AD/ADRD).
 
Half
 
of
 
the
 
residents
 
will
 
be
 
recruited
 
in
 
[LOCATION_004]
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58528].
 
Residents
 
will
 
be
 
recruited
 
from
 
6
 
communities
 
in
 
or
 
within
 
30
 
minutes
 
of
 
Santa
 
Barbara
 
and
 
6
 
communities
 
near
 
[LOCATION_011].
 
Recruitment
 
efforts
 
will
 
be
 
extended
 
to
 
additional
 
communities
 
if
 
additional
 
participants
 
are
 
needed,
 
or
 
if
 
doing
 
so
 
would
 
increase
 
sample
 
diversity.
 
Adult
 
children
 
(age
 
18+)
 
will
 
participate
 
remotely,
 
and
 
may
 
reside
 
anywhere
 
in
 
the
 
world.
 
The
 
average
 
age
 
of
 
residents
 
across
 
the
 
[ADDRESS_63769]
 
precise
 
data
 
on
 
residents’
 
levels
 
of
 
cognitive
 
impairment,
 
but
 
it
 
is
 
estimated
 
that
 
29%
 
of
 
residents
 
have
 
MCI
 
and
 
40%
 
have
 
AD/ADRD. 
   The demographic makeup of the participating communities is majority female (approximately 70%) and 
majority
 
white
 
(approximately
 
85%),
 
with
 
small
 
percentages
 
of
 
Hispanic
 
(5.3%),
 
Black
 
(2.2%),
 
and
 
Non-Hispanic
 
Other
 
(6%)
 
groups.
 
Based
 
on
 
the
 
demographic
 
features
 
of
 
the
 
participating
 
communities,
 
the
 
planned
 
distribution
 
of
 
subjects
 
by
 
[CONTACT_4321],
 
race,
 
and
 
ethnicity
 
will
 
be
 
a
 
function
 
of
 
these
 
underlying
 
features
 
and
 
efforts
 
to
 
increase
 
the
 
diversity
 
of
 
our
 
sample
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58529]/or
 
members
 
of
 
under-represented
 
racial
 
and
 
ethnic
 
groups. 
   With respect to gender, because female residents outnumber male residents by [CONTACT_58530],
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
communities
 
participating
 
in
 
the
 
study,
 
we
 
anticipate
 
that
 
our
 
sample
 
will
 
include
 
more
 
female
 
than
 
male
 
residents.
 
We
 
plan
 
to
 
over-sample
 
male
 
residents,
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
planned
 
enrollment
 
of
 
[ADDRESS_63770] to race and ethnicity, the overwhelming majority of residents in senior living communities 
are
 
White,
 
both
 
in
 
national
 
statistics
 
(84%)
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
communities
 
participating
 
in
 
the
 
study
 
(85%).
 
Thus,
 
we
 
anticipate
 
that
 
our
 
sample
 
will
 
include
 
more
 
White
 
than
 
non-White
 
residents.
 
Increasing
 
the
 
ethnic
 
and
 
socioeconomic
 
diversity
 
of
 
the
 
sample
 
is
 
a
 
high
 
priority
 
for
 
this
 
study.
 
Through
 
outreach
 
efforts
 
(described
 
below)
 
we
 
plan
 
to
 
over-sample
 
residents
 
who
 
identify
 
as
 
members
 
of
 
minority
 
groups,
 
 NIH Protocol Templa te for Beha vioral and Social Sciences Resear ch Involving Humans – v4.0 2018-12-12 22  
 Technology and Family Thriving Study (Thriv e) Version 1.0 Protocol NIH 13336607 16 March 2025  resulting in a planned enrollment of 80 percent White, 20 percent (combined) Hispanic, Black, Asian, and 
other
 
non-Hispanic
 
White
 
residents.
 
The
 
participating
 
communities
 
in
 
[LOCATION_004]
 
have
 
slightly
 
higher
 
percentages
 
of
 
Hispanic
 
residents,
 
whereas
 
those
 
in
 
[LOCATION_011]
 
have
 
slightly
 
higher
 
percentages
 
of
 
Black
 
and
 
Asian
 
residents.
 
Together,
 
these
 
East
 
and
 
West
 
Coast
 
communities
 
will
 
allow
 
us
 
to
 
increase
 
the
 
overall
 
diversity
 
of
 
our
 
sample
 
and
 
improve
 
the
 
generalizability
 
of
 
our
 
findings. 
   With respect to adult children who will be recruited in tandem with their parents (residents), we assume 
that
 
their
 
racial
 
and
 
ethnic
 
makeup
 
will
 
be
 
similar
 
to
 
their
 
parents.
 
However,
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
gender,
 
our
 
Phase
 
1
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58492]
 
(57%
 
male,
 
43%
 
female)
 
with
 
their
 
(mostly
 
female)
 
parents.
 
Thus
 
we
 
estimate
 
that
 
roughly
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
adult
 
children
 
in
 
this
 
Phase
 
II
 
study
 
will
 
be
 
male,
 
and
 
that
 
their
 
racial
 
and
 
ethnic
 
identity
 
will
 
match
 
that
 
of
 
residents.
 
We
 
will
 
work
 
hard
 
to
 
recruit
 
a
 
diverse
 
set
 
of
 
families
 
through
 
special
 
outreach
 
efforts
 
to
 
adult
 
children
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
their
 
parents. 
 
 Rationale for selection of sex/gender and racial/ethnic group members: Targeted enrollment estimates are based on a joint consideration of the gender/racial/ethnic 
characteristics
 
of
 
the
 
communities
 
participating
 
in
 
the
 
study,
 
and
 
the
 
significant
 
recruitment
 
efforts
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
undertaken
 
to
 
over-sample
 
male
 
residents
 
and
 
members
 
of
 
under-represented
 
minority
 
groups.
 
With
 
these
 
efforts,
 
and
 
the
 
large
 
sample
 
size
 
for
 
this
 
study
 
(192
 
dyads,
 
384
 
individuals),
 
the
 
resulting
 
data
 
will
 
permit
 
us
 
to
 
explore
 
potentially
 
important
 
racial/ethnic
 
differences
 
in
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
(ease
 
of
 
use
 
and
 
satisfaction)
 
of
 
Rendever,
 
and
 
its
 
impact
 
on
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
and
 
caregiver
 
guilt. 
   Proposed outreach programs for recruiting sex/gender and racial/ethnic group members as subjects: Increasing the diversity of our sample will be a high priority. The following efforts will be made to 
increase
 
diversity:
 
(a)
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
will
 
work
 
closely
 
with
 
Directors
 
at
 
each
 
community
 
to
 
identify
 
eligible
 
residents
 
from
 
under-represented
 
groups
 
so
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
enhance
 
our
 
personal
 
outreach
 
efforts;
 
(b)
 
we
 
will
 
recruit
 
an
 
ethnically
 
diverse
 
research
 
team,
 
including
 
Spanish
 
speaking
 
staff
 
and
 
research
 
assistants
 
who
 
will
 
build
 
rapport
 
and
 
comfort
 
among
 
Spanish-speaking
 
families.
 
Likewise,
 
we
 
will
 
engage
 
in
 
special
 
outreach
 
efforts
 
for
 
Black
 
and
 
Asian
 
residents,
 
with
 
diverse
 
members
 
of
 
our
 
research
 
team,
 
to
 
create
 
meaningful
 
and
 
authentic
 
social
 
connections;
 
(c)
 
we
 
will
 
plan
 
special
 
meet-and-greet
 
sessions
 
at
 
Grace
 
Village,
 
the
 
affordable
 
housing
 
community
 
where
 
40%
 
of
 
residents
 
use
 
Spanish
 
as
 
their
 
primary
 
language,
 
and
 
10%
 
use
 
other
 
primary
 
languages
 
(including
 
Chinese
 
and
 
Russian).
 
We
 
will
 
have
 
recruitment
 
materials
 
translated
 
into
 
Spanish
 
(including
 
flyers,
 
letters
 
to
 
family
 
members,
 
and
 
consent
 
materials)
 
and,
 
if
 
needed,
 
other
 
languages.
 
(d)
 
We
 
will
 
host
 
culturally
 
sensitive
 
recruitment
 
events
 
and
 
prepare
 
culturally
 
sensitive
 
research
 
materials,
 
activities
 
(in
 
VR/Zoom),
 
and
 
tokens
 
of
 
appreciation.
 
(e)
 
Finally,
 
to
 
increase
 
the
 
socio-economic
 
diversity
 
of
 
the
 
sample,
 
we
 
will
 
provide
 
resources
 
to
 
facilitate
 
the
 
participation
 
of
 
lower-income
 
families
 
(e.g.,
 
Wi-Fi
 
hotspots
 
for
 
family
 
members). 
   In addition to these steps, we will broaden recruitment efforts to additional communities if doing so 
would
 
increase
 
the
 
diversity
 
of
 
the
 
sample.
 
As
 
noted
 
above,
 
we
 
already
 
have
 
permission
 
to
 
recruit
 
residents
 
from
 
[ADDRESS_63771] physical disabilities or visual impairments. 
Residents
 
with
 
physical
 
limitations
 
(who
 
need
 
the
 
assistance
 
of
 
wheelchairs,
 
walkers,
 
or
 
staff
 
to
 
move)
 
will
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
study
 
(and,
 
if
 
needed,
 
assisted
 
by
 
a
 
personal
 
caregiver
 
or
 
staff
 
member).
 
Residents
 
with
 
visual
 
impairments
 
will
 
be
 
screened
 
to
 
determine
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
see
 
images
 
in
 
the
 
VR
 
headset
 
or
 
on
  NIH Protocol Templa te for Beha vioral and Social Sciences Resear ch Involving Humans – v4.0 2018-12-12 23  
 Technology and Family Thriving Study (Thriv e) Version 1.0 Protocol NIH 13336607 16 March 2025  the Zoom screen. In the Phase I pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 3 of the participating residents were legally blind but were 
able
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
VR
 
images
 
(which
 
are
 
large
 
and
 
designed
 
for
 
seniors)
 
and
 
successfully
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
study. 
   Rationale for proposed exclusion sex/gender or racial/ethnic groups: No participants will be excluded based upon sexual identity, sexual orientation, gender, or racial/ethnic 
identification. 
   Recruitment Plan: Following successful recruitment procedures developed in the Phase 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the 
recruitment
 
process
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
in
 
several
 
steps.
   Step 1: Letters to the families of the residents will be emailed, describing the study and letting them 
know
 
that,
 
if
 
they
 
qualify,
 
their
 
family
 
might
 
be
 
invited
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
study
 
in
 
the
 
near
 
future.
 
The
 
letter
 
will
 
also
 
give
 
them
 
contact
 
[CONTACT_58531]. 
   Step 2: The Director at each community will announce the study to residents via email, flyers, and 
community
 
newsletters.
 
Directors
 
will
 
also
 
announce
 
the
 
study
 
at
 
large
 
gatherings
 
(e.g.,
 
monthly
 
community
 
meetings,
 
movie
 
nights),
 
where
 
researchers
 
will
 
be
 
present
 
to
 
introduce
 
themselves
 
and
 
answer
 
questions.
 
Residents
 
will
 
be
 
invited
 
to
 
contact
 
[CONTACT_58532]
 
(in
 
person,
 
via
 
phone,
 
or
 
email)
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
interested
 
in
 
learning
 
more.
 
THe
 
research
 
team
 
will
 
also
 
hold
 
community
 
meet-and-greet
 
events,
 
where
 
they
 
will
 
pass
 
out
 
flyers
 
(in
 
English
 
and
 
Spanish,
 
where
 
relevant)
 
and
 
gather
 
names
 
of
 
interested
 
residents. 
   Step 3: Directors and key staff of the communities will assist in identifying eligible residents (screening 
for
 
eligibility).
   Step 4: Once identified, potentially eligible residents will be invited to talk with the researchers (in the 
resident’s
 
room
 
or
 
apartment,
 
or
 
in
 
another
 
private
 
space
 
if
 
preferred)
 
to
 
determine
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
interested
 
in
 
participating,
 
and
 
verify
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
eligible
 
to
 
participate.
 
The
 
researchers
 
will
 
explain
 
the
 
purpose
 
and
 
procedures
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
gather
 
initial
 
verbal
 
consent
 
to
 
participate.
 
At
 
this
 
time,
 
researchers
 
will
 
administer
 
the
 
MMSE
 
to
 
verify
 
eligibility.
 
If
 
a
 
resident’s
 
ability
 
to
 
consent
 
is
 
uncertain,
 
the
 
researcher
 
will
 
complete
 
an
 
IRB-approved
 
screener
 
assessing
 
their
 
decision-making
 
capacity
 
to
 
consent,
 
and
 
consent
 
will
 
be
 
obtained
 
from
 
the
 
resident’s
 
legal
 
guardian
 
as
 
needed. 
   Step 5: Contact [CONTACT_58533].
 
If
 
the
 
resident
 
has
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
eligible
 
adult
 
child,
 
the
 
researcher
 
will
 
randomly
 
select
 
from
 
the
 
list
 
of
 
eligible
 
children.
 
Researchers
 
will
 
call
 
the
 
adult
 
child,
 
explain
 
the
 
study,
 
and
 
gather
 
initial
 
verbal
 
consent.
 
If
 
the
 
adult
 
child
 
declines
 
to
 
participate,
 
then
 
the
 
researcher
 
will
 
consult
 
with
 
that
 
child
 
(and
 
the
 
resident
 
if
 
needed)
 
and
 
will
 
contact
 
[CONTACT_58534],
 
if
 
available.
 
If
 
no
 
child
 
is
 
willing
 
and
 
able
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
study,
 
the
 
resident
 
will
 
be
 
offered
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
engage
 
in
 
a
 
virtual
 
reality
 
activity
 
just
 
for
 
their
 
enjoyment.
 
In
 
our
 
Phase
 
1
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58483],
 
there
 
were
 
only
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
instances
 
in
 
which
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
adult
 
children
 
were
 
unable
 
or
 
unwilling
 
to
 
participate
 
with
 
an
 
interested
 
resident. 
   Step 6: Once all initial verbal consents are received from the resident and adult child, the family dyad will 
be
 
enrolled
 
in
 
the
 
study.

 Technology and Family Thriving Study (Thriv e) Version 1.0 Protocol NIH 13336607 16 March 2025    Step 7: Residents and adult children will next complete the formal consent process. Residents will be 
given
 
written
 
consent
 
forms
 
to
 
sign.
 
In
 
addition,

moderate
 
dementia
 
(and
 
any
 
other
 
residents
 
who
 
request
 
it)
 
to
 
ensure
 
they
 
understand
 
the
 
study
 
procedures
 
and
 
associated
 
risks
 
and

Adult
 
children
 
will
 
be

If
 
applicable,
 
the
 
resident’s
 
legal
 
guardian
 
will
 
be
 
emailed
 
a
 
link
 
to
 
an
 
online,
 
digital
 
consent
 
form.
   Step 8: Continuing consent will be obtained from residents with mild to moderate dementia before 
beginning
 
each
 
of
 
the
 
VR/Zoom
 
sessions
 
using
 
a
 
verbal
 
consent
 
“check-list”
 
(created
 
and
 
approved
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58535])
 
whereby
 
[CONTACT_58536],
 
what
 
will
 
happen,
 
the
 
risks,
 
and
 
the
 
benefits
 
in
 
very
 
plain
 
language
 
and
 
asks
 
the
 
resident
 
if
 
they
 
understand
 
each
 
question.
 
If
 
the
 
resident
 
is
 
capable
 
and
 
competent
 
at
 
answering
 
the
 
questions,
 
and
 
is
 
alert
 
and
 
oriented
 
to
 
their
 
surroundings,
 
or
 
if
 
the
 
resident
 
reports
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
want
 
to
 
participate,
 
then
 
the
 
sessions
 
will
 
not
 
proceed
 
that
 
day.
 
The
 
researchers
 
will
 
speak
 
with
 
the
 
Director
 
of
 
the
 
senior
 
living
 
community,
 
adult
 
child,
 
and
 
later
 
with
 
the
 
resident
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
determination
 
whether
 
or
 
not
 
the
 
family
 
should
 
continue
 
the
 
study.
 
If
 
a
 
resident
 
or
 
adult
 
child
 
wants
 
to
 
stop
 
the
 
study,
 
they
 
may
 
do
 
so
 
at
 
any
 
time. 
   Retention: Participants will be asked to complete 5 weeks of study activities (T1 to T5), followed by 1-month and 
3-month
 
follow-up
 
surveys
 
(T6-T7).
 
The
 
first
 
week
 
(T1)
 
will
 
consist
 
of
 
consent
 
and
 
a
 
baseline
 
survey.
 
Next,
 
participants
 
will
 
engage
 
in
 
virtual
 
reality
 
(VR)
 
or
 
Zoom
 
activities
 
once
 
a
 
week
 
for
 
4
 
consecutive
 
weeks.
 
After
 
each
 
VR/Zoom
 
session,
 
participants
 
will
 
complete
 
a
 
brief
 
survey.
 
After
 
Session
 
4
 
(T5)
 
and
 
1-month
 
later
 
(T6)
 
they
 
will
 
also
 
complete
 
a
 
brief
 
interview.
 
Each
 
VR/Zoom
 
session
 
will
 
last
 
approximately
 
1
 
hour
 
(including
 
set-up,
 
20
 
minute
 
VR/Zoom
 
activity,
 
break,
 
and
 
survey/interview).
 
Some
 
sessions
 
may
 
last
 
longer
 
(up
 
to
 
1.5
 
hours)
 
if
 
residents
 
and
 
adult
 
children
 
want
 
to
 
stay
 
longer,
 
as
 
they
 
often
 
did
 
in
 
the
 
Phase
 
1
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58483]
 
(especially
 
for
 
the
 
Life
 
Story
 
and
 
Virtual
 
Photos/Videos
 
sessions).
 
Residents
 
will
 
complete
 
their
 
VR/Zoom
 
activities
 
in
 
a
 
private
 
room
 
in
 
their
 
senior
 
living
 
community;
 
adult
 
children
 
will
 
complete
 
their
 
activities
 
remotely
 
from
 
their
 
own
 
homes.
 
Follow-up
 
surveys
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
in
 
person
 
for
 
residents
 
and
 
via
 
online
 
surveys
 
for
 
adult
 
children.
   Retention of study participants will be a high priority. Building on successful procedures developed in the 
Phase

build
 
strong
 
rapport
 
with
 
participants

warm
 
and
 
welcoming
 
manner,

Second,
 
at
 
all
 
stages
 
in
 
the
 
research
 
process
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
will
 
be
 
sensitive
 
to
 
the
 
physical
 
and
 
emotional
 
needs
 
of
 
participants.
 
In
 
particular,
 
research
 
assistants
 
will
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
participants
 
are
 
comfortable
 
with
 
the
 
VR/Zoom
 
equipment,
 
that
 
any
 
physical
 
limitations
 
and
 
challenges
 
are
 
approached
 
in
 
a
 
sensitive
 
and
 
caring
 
manner,
 
that
 
emotional
 
responses
 
are
 
carefully
 
monitored
 
and
 
responded
 
to
 
as
 
needed
 
(e.g.,
 
allowing
 
participants
 
to
 
share
 
their
 
emotional
 
experiences
 
in
 
both
 
unstructured
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
structured
 
ways),
 
and
 
that
 
VR/Zoom
 
activities
 
are
 
pleasant
 
and
 
enjoyable.
 
For
 
example,
 
when
 
preparing
 
reminiscence
 
activities
 
(Life
 
Story
 
and
 
photos/videos),
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
will
 
work
 
with
 
family
 
members
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
these
 
activities
 
are
 
pleasant
 
and
 
meaningful
 
(e.g.,
 
selecting
 
photographs
 
and
 
locations
 
that
 
are
 
associated
 
with
 
positive
 
memories
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
resident’s
 
childhood
 
home
 
and
 
locations
 
they
 
loved
 
to
 
visit
 
from
 
their
 
past).

safety,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
instructed
 
to
 
remain
 
seated
 
when
 
using
 
the
 
VR/Zoom
 
equipment.
 
If
 
the
 
residents
 
have
 
MCI,
 
they
 
will
 
have
 
the
 
option
 
of
 
completing
 
their
 
surveys
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
(with
 
some
 
assistance)
 
or
 
having
 
a
 
research
 
assistant
 
read
 
the
 
surveys
 
to
 
them
 
and
 
record
 
their
 
responses.
 
If
 
the
 
resident
 
has
 
AD/ADRD,
 
the
 
survey
 
will
 
be
 
read
 
to
 
them
 
and
 
the
 
responses
 
will
 
be
 
recorded.
 
In
 
addition,
 
participants
 
with
 
AD/ADRD
 
(and
 
any
 
other
 
residents
 
who
 
request
 
it)
 
will
 
be
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58493].
 
If
 
a
 
resident
 
is
 
unable
 
(or
 
unwilling)
 
to
 
come
 
to
 
the
 
study
 
room,
 
they
 
will
 
have
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
VR/Zoom
 
sessions
 
from
 
their
 
own
 
room.
 
All
 
of
 
the
 
equipment
 
is
 
portable. 
   Another important tool for fostering retention will be to provide clear and effective study materials that 
guide
 
participants
 
through
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
reduce
 
burden.
 
Residents
 
will
 
receive
 
clear,
 
visually
 
appealing,
 
and
 
simple
 
study
 
reminder
 
sheet
 
listing
 
dates
 
and
 
times
 
of
 
their
 
scheduled
 
study
 
sessions,
 
and
 
contact
 
[CONTACT_58540].
 
It
 
will
 
also
 
include
 
photographs
 
of
 
the
 
researchers'
 
faces
 
to
 
enhance
 
visual
 
recognition.
 
The
 
residents
 
will
 
be
 
encouraged
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
schedule
 
on
 
their
 
refrigerator
 
or
 
somewhere
 
they
 
can
 
see
 
it.
 
Adult
 
children
 
will
 
receive
 
a
 
carefully
 
constructed
 
packet
 
guiding
 
them
 
through
 
each
 
VR/Zoom
 
session
 
and
 
providing
 
tips
 
and
 
reminders
 
for
 
each
 
week.
 
Rendever
 
will
 
also
 
assist
 
family
 
members
 
in
 
uploading
 
photos,
 
including
 
those
 
from
 
the
 
resident’s
 
childhood,
 
with
 
a
 
simple
 
“drag
 
and
 
drop”
 
interface
 
to
 
Rendever’s
 
secure,
 
online
 
portal.
 
For
 
adult
 
children
 
who
 
will
 
be
 
operating
 
the
 
equipment
 
remotely,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
will
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
VR
 
equipment
 
runs
 
smoothly,
 
that
 
a
 
research
 
team
 
member
 
responds
 
quickly
 
and
 
effectively
 
to
 
questions
 
and
 
troubleshooting
 
requests,
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
research
 
teams
 
are
 
mindful
 
and
 
appreciative
 
of
 
family
 
members’
 
time
 
and
 
schedule. 
   Another way that retention will be fostered is through flexible scheduling. VR/Zoom sessions will be 
offered
 
at
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
times
 
throughout
 
the
 
day
 
and
 
on
 
weekends
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
accommodate
 
the
 
schedules
 
of
 
busy
 
residents
 
and
 
families.
 
If
 
the
 
resident
 
has
 
AD/ADRD,
 
however,
 
we
 
will
 
not
 
schedule
 
them
 
later
 
in
 
the
 
afternoon
 
or
 
evening
 
to
 
prevent
 
Sundowning.
 
The
 
research
 
team
 
will
 
call
 
(and
 
email,
 
if
 
preferred)
 
residents
 
and
 
adult
 
family
 
member
 
reminders
 
a
 
few
 
days
 
before
 
and
 
then
 
again,
 
the
 
day
 
before
 
their
 
VR/Zoom
 
appointments
 
or
 
surveys/interviews.
 
Research
 
assistants
 
will
 
also
 
confirm
 
with
 
the
 
adult
 
family
 
member
 
that
 
he/she
 
is
 
able
 
to
 
take
 
part
 
in
 
the
 
VR/Zoom
 
session
 
that
 
day
 
(and
 
reschedule
 
if
 
needed).
 
Reminders
 
and
 
flexible
 
scheduling
 
are
 
essential
 
to
 
retaining
 
participants. 
   Continued participation will be encouraged by [CONTACT_58541],
 
and
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58542]’s
 
important
 
contribution
 
to
 
scientific
 
research
 
on
 
successful
 
aging.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
verbal
 
expressions
 
of
 
gratitude,
 
residents
 
and
 
family
 
members
 
will
 
be
 
given
 
small
 
tokens
 
of
 
appreciation
 
at
 
key
 
points
 
in
 
the
 
study.
 
For
 
example,
 
after
 
the
 
final
 
VR/Zoom
 
session,
 
residents
 
will
 
receive
 
a
 
handwritten
 
thank
 
you
 
note
 
from
 
the
 
research
 
team.
 
After
 
each
 
VR/Zoom
 
session,
 
residents
 
will
 
be
 
provided
 
with
 
juice
 
and
 
a
 
snack,
 
and
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
rest
 
and
 
chat
 
with
 
the
 
researchers.
 
These
 
gifts
 
and
 
snacks
 
will
 
follow
 
the
 
COVID-[ADDRESS_63774].
 
Small
 
measures
 
such
 
as
 
these
 
increase
 
participants’
 
enjoyment,
 
sense
 
of
 
purpose,
 
and
 
commitment
 
to
 
the
 
project.
 
It
 
is
 
also
 
hoped
 
that
 
these
 
measures
 
will
 
lead
 
participants
 
to
 
leave
 
the
 
study
 
feeling
 
that
 
their
 
participation
 
was
 
worthwhile
 
and
 
meaningful. 
   Finally, although the research team will work hard to retain participants in the study, researchers will be 
very
 
mindful
 
of
 
the
 
vulnerable
 
population
 
and
 
careful
 
to
 
avoid
 
any
 
sense
 
of
 
coercion.
 
The
 
research
 
team
 
will
 
be
 
respectful
 
and
 
considerate
 
to
 
any
 
participants
 
who
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
withdraw
 
from
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
will
 
refrain
 
from
 
any
 
efforts
 
to
 
pressure
 
them
 
to
 
continue.

mental
 
health
 
of
 
residents
 
and
 
is
 
particularly
 
useful
 
for
 
residents
 
with
 
AD/ADRD
 
because
 
they
 
often
 
recall
 
their
 
past
 
even
 
if
 
their
 
short-term
 
memory
 
is
 
tenuous.
 
Individualizing
 
the
 
VR
 
experience
 
and
 
focusing
 
on
 
the
 
residents’
 
past
 
and
 
on
 
nostalgic
 
experiences
 
should
 
increase
 
the
 
likelihood
 
that
 
it
 
will
 
induce
 
positive
 
emotions
 
and
 
be
 
enjoyable.
 
However,
 
because
 
some
 
research
 
shows
 
that
 
reminiscing
 
about
 
one’s
 
past
 
life
 
can
 
sometimes
 
produce
 
negative
 
emotions,
 
we
 
follow
 
the
 
recommendations
 
of
 
other
 
researchers
 
and
 
will
 
only
 
use
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58494]. 
   Preliminary testing of Rendever shows that it improves positive emotions, energy, and physical/mental 
health
 
in
 
older
 
adults
 
without
 
cognitive
 
impairments.
 
However,
 
the
 
feasibility
 
of
 
Rendever
 
for
 
residents
 
with
 
dementia,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
its
 
remote
 
capabilities
 
with
 
family
 
members,
 
has
 
not
 
been
 
tested
 
until

pi[INVESTIGATOR_58483].
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
next
 
step
 
in
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
testing
 
the
 
technology
 
where
 
we
 
can
 
show
 
that

has
 
a
 
positive
 
and
 
longer-term
 
impact
 
on
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
for
 
the
 
residents
 
and
 
their
 
adult
 
children. 
   Residents with dementia long to maintain connections to family, have control over their lives, and feel as 
if
 
their
 
lives
 
still
 
have
 
meaning.
 
VR,
 
through
 
the
 
Rendever
 
platform,
 
could
 
provide
 
an
 
important
 
means
 
through
 
which
 
they
 
maintain
 
their
 
relationships
 
with
 
their
 
children
 
and
 
reclaim
 
their
 
past.
 
The
 
Rendever
 
platform
 
could
 
also
 
benefit
 
adult
 
children
 
by
 
[CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_58495]'s
 
guilt
 
about
 
their
 
parent’s
 
quality
 
of
 
life.
 
This
 
study
 
is
 
an
 
important
 
next
 
step
 
toward
 
determining
 
if
 
Rendever
 
can
 
improve
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
of
 
residents
 
with
 
dementia
 
and
 
their
 
adult
 
children
 
living
 
at
 
a
 
distance.
 
If
 
this
 
Phase
 
II
 
study
 
is
 
successful,
 
it
 
will
 
provide
 
evidence
 
for
 
a
 
validated
 
and
 
more
 
marketable
 
product
 
that
 
residential

communities
 
can
 
confidently
 
adopt

incorporate
 
into
 
their

to
 
improve
 
quality
 
of

In
 
this

 Technology and Family Thriving Study (Thriv e) Version 1.0 Protocol NIH 13336607 16 March 2025    VR Sessions:  Dyads assigned to the VR condition will engage in four VR activities: (1) virtual adventures, 
(2)
 
virtual
 
travel
 
to
 
one’s
 
childhood
 
homes
 
and
 
other
 
memorable
 
destinations
 
(“Life

(3)
 
virtual
 
guided
 
travel
 
experiences,
 
and
 
(4)
 
virtual
 
family
 
photos
 
and
 
videos
.
 
In
 
VR
 
Session
 
1
 
(
virtual
 
adventures
),
 
the
 
dyad
 
will
 
choose
 
5
 
travel
 
adventures
 
(e.g.,
 
a
 
safari,
 
riding
 
in
 
a
 
hot
 
air
 
balloon,
 
boat
 
ride
 
in
 
Thailand)
 
among
 
25
 
possible
 
pre-programmed
 
adventures.
 
In
 
Session
 
2
 
(
virtual
 
Life
 
Story
),
 
research
 
assistants
 
will
 
take
 
the
 
residents
 
and
 
their
 
adult
 
child
 
back
 
to
 
8-[ADDRESS_63776]
 
(e.g.,
 
childhood
 
homes,
 
family
 
vacation
 
sites,
 
schools
 
they
 
attended,
 
where
 
they
 
were
 
married).
 
The
 
adult
 
child
 
will
 
input
 
the
 
addresses
 
into
 
the
 
Rendever
 
portal.
 
For
 
Session
 
3
 
(
virtual
 
guided
 
experiences
),
 
the
 
researchers
 
will
 
take
 
the
 
dyad
 
on
 
a
 
narrated
 
tour
 
of
 
a
 
chosen
 
destination.
 
They
 
will
 
be
 
provided
 
a
 
list
 
of
 
approximately
 
20
 
travel
 
destinations
 
and
 
will
 
be
 
allowed
 
to
 
choose
 
one
 
to
 
explore.
 
The
 
researcher
 
will
 
read
 
fun
 
facts
 
about
 
the
 
destination
 
while
 
they
 
are
 
seeing
 
it
 
inside
 
the
 
VR.
 
For
 
Session
 
4
 
(
virtual
 
photos
 
and
 
videos
),
 
the
 
adult
 
children
 
will
 
upload
 
20-25
 
family
 
photos
 
and
 
2
 
videos
 
with
 
a
 
simple
 
“drag
 
and
 
drop”
 
interface
 
to
 
Rendever’s
 
password-protected,
 
online
 
portal.
 
The
 
order
 
of
 
the
 
sessions
 
is
 
designed
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
first
 
session
 
does
 
not
 
require
 
any
 
extra
 
effort
 
of
 
the
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
adult
 
child;
 
it
 
allows
 
the
 
adult
 
child
 
enough
 
time
 
to
 
upload
 
photos,
 
videos,
 
and
 
addresses
 
before
 
sessions
 
#2
 
and
 
#4. 
   The resident will experience the VR sessions in a private room at the senior living community, 
accompanied
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58543]
 
a
 
control
 
tablet.
 
When
 
written
 
consent
 
is
 
gathered,
 
the
 
adult
 
children
 
and
 
older
 
adults
 
will
 
complete
 
three
 
brief
 
background
 
measures
 
that
 
assess
 
their
 
physical
 
health
 
(Promis-[ADDRESS_63777],
 
and
 
the
 
Lubben
 
social
 
isolation
 
index)
 
right
 
afterward
 
(this
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
the
 
week
 
before
 
the
 
baseline
 
survey
 
and
 
is
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
break-up
 
the
 
baseline
 
survey
 
in
 
two,
 
to
 
reduce
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
time
 
spent
 
on
 
any
 
one
 
survey).
 
The
 
baseline
 
survey
 
will
 
be
 
completed
 
the
 
week
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
first
 
VR
 
session.
 
A
 
research
 
assistant
 
(or
 
senior
 
personnel
 
if
 
the
 
older
 
adult
 
has
 
dementia)
 
will
 
administer
 
the
 
surveys
 
verbally
 
and
 
record
 
the
 
responses.
 
If
 
the
 
residents
 
have
 
MCI,
 
they
 
should
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
complete
 
their
 
own
 
paper
 
and
 
pencil
 
survey
 
with
 
assistance.
 
The
 
adult
 
child
 
will
 
be
 
emailed
 
a
 
link
 
to
 
a
 
Qualtrics
 
survey
 
to
 
complete
 
immediately
 
after
 
each
 
VR
 
session.
 
We
 
will
 
briefly
 
(15
 
min)
 
interview
 
residents
 
and
 
adult
 
children
 
separately
 
after
 
the
 
last
 
technology
 
session
 
and
 
at
 
the
 
1-month
 
follow-up.
 
Instead
 
of
 
interviews
 
at
 
the
 
follow-ups.
 
Interviews
 
with
 
the
 
adult
 
children
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
via
 
the
 
telephone.
 
Participants
 
will
 
be
 
asked
 
what
 
they
 
liked
 
and
 
did
 
not
 
like
 
about
 
the
 
technology
 
sessions
 
and
 
how
 
they
 
felt
 
doing
 
it
 
with
 
their
 
family
 
members. 
   The adult children will participate in the VR sessions from their own home. They will be mailed the VR 
headset,
 
along
 
with
 
a
 
pamphlet
 
containing
 
a
 
timeline,
 
an
 
outline
 
of
 
what
 
will
 
happen,
 
how
 
to
 
operate
 
the
 
equipment,
 
and
 
tips
 
for
 
having
 
a
 
successful
 
experience.
 
Rendever
 
will
 
contact
 
[CONTACT_58544].
 
A
 
research
 
assistant
 
will
 
also
 
call
 
the
 
adult
 
child
 
before
 
the
 
first
 
session
 
and
 
go
 
over
 
the
 
procedures.
 
The
 
adult
 
child
 
will
 
be
 
encouraged
 
to
 
talk
 
with
 
their
 
parents
 
about
 
what
 
they
 
are
 
experiencing
 
while
 
in
 
the
 
VR
 
together.
 
Based
 
upon
 
previous
 
research
 
on
 
reminiscence
 
therapy,
 
the
 
adult
 
children
 
will
 
be
 
encouraged
 
to
 
simply
 
let
 
their
 
parents
 
enjoy
 
the
 
photos
 
and
 
travel
 
experiences
 
naturally,
 
to
 
listen
 
to
 
them
 
share
 
their
 
memories,
 
and
 
not
 
to
 
force
 
memories
 
they
 
might
 
not
 
have
 
or
 
attempt
 
to
 
change
 
them. 
 
 
Zoom
 
Sessions:
 
Dyads
 
assigned
 
to
 
the
 
active
 
control
 
condition
 
will
 
follow
 
the
 
same
 
weekly
 
procedures
 
and
 
survey/interview
 
assessments
 
as
 
those
 
in
 
the
 
VR
 
condition,
 
except
 
that
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
engaging
 
in
 
video
 
chat
 
conversations
 
instead
 
of
 
VR.
 
During

session.
 
During
 
each
 
Zoom
 
session,
 
the
 
resident
 
and
 
adult
 
child
 
will
 
be
 
encouraged
 
to
 
talk
 
with
 
each
 
other
 
like
 
they
 
normally
 
would.
 
 
6.1.2 Administration and/or Dosing 
All residents will participate in their study sessions and surveys from a private room in their senior living 
community.
 
All
 
adult
 
children
 
will
 
complete
 
their
 
study
 
sessions
 
and
 
all
 
surveys
 
virtually.
 
Resident-adult
 
child
 
dyads
 
will
 
complete
 
a
 
consent
 
form
 
and
 
three
 
brief
 
background
 
measures
 
(on
 
physical
 
health
 
and
 
social
 
isolation),
 
a
 
baseline
 
survey
 
the
 
week
 
before
 
the
 
technology
 
sessions,
 
followed
 
by
 
4
 
virtual
 
reality
 
(VR)
 
or
 
Zoom
 
experiences
 
(described
 
below)
 
once
 
a
 
week
 
for
 
four
 
consecutive
 
weeks,
 
a
 
post-study
 
survey,
 
and
 
then
 
a
 
1-
 
and
 
3-month
 
follow-up
 
survey.
 
Each
 
VR/Zoom
 
session
 
will
 
last
 
approximately
 
30
 
minutes,
 
but
 
could
 
be
 
longer
 
if
 
participants
 
desire.
 
Surveys
 
will
 
occur
 
immediately
 
after
 
each
 
VR/Zoom
 
session,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
an
 
interview
 
after
 
the
 
last
 
VR/Zoom
 
session
 
(see
 
the
 
table
 
below).
 
All
 
residents
 
will
 
receive
 
the
 
same
 
surveys
 
and
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
adult
 
children
 
will
 
receive
 
the
 
same
 
surveys
 
(the
 
adult
 
children
 
have
 
slightly
 
different
 
measures,
 
such
 
as
 
caregiver
 
guilt,
 
which
 
residents
 
do
 
not
 
complete).
 
All
 
primary
 
outcome
 
measures
 
will
 
be
 
asked
 
at
 
four
 
key
 
time
 
points
 
(baseline,
 
1-week
 
post-intervention,
 
1-month
 
post-intervention,
 
and
 
3-months
 
post-intervention).
 
The
 
surveys
 
after
 
each
 
technology
 
session
 
will
 
be
 
much
 
briefer,
 
focusing
 
on
 
secondary
 
outcomes
 
including
 
experiences
 
with
 
the
 
technology,
 
affective
 
states,
 
and
 
how
 
they
 
felt
 
about
 
their
 
relationship
 
with
 
their
 
family
 
member
 
while
 
using
 
the
 
technology
 
and
 
during
 
the
 
past
 
week. 
 
After
 
the
 
study
 
is
 
completely
 
over,
 
the
 
adult
 
children
 
will
 
be
 
emailed
 
a
 
brief,
 
three-minute
 
commercialization
 
survey
 
that
 
asks
 
them
 
the
 
extent
 
to
 
which
 
they
 
would
 
use
 
the
 
product
 
at
 
home
 
if
 
it
 
were
 
available
 
and
 
how
 
much
 
they
 
would
 
pay
 
for
 
it.
 
   All of the VR/Zoom sessions with the residents will occur in person. All interviews will be audio-taped 
and
 
the
 
VR/Zoom
 
sessions
 
with
 
the
 
residents
 
will
 
be
 
audio
 
and
 
video-taped.
 
The
 
videotapes
 
will
 
be
 
coded
 
later
 
with
 
human
 
and
 
automated
 
coding
 
to
 
assess
 
residents’
 
bodily
 
and
 
conversational
 
engagement
 
while
 
using
 
the
 
VR.
 
All
 
of
 
the
 
audiotapes
 
will
 
be
 
transcribed.
 
The
 
follow-up
 
interviews
 
will
 
be
 
collected
 
face-to-face
 
with
 
the
 
residents
 
and
 
via
 
the
 
telephone
 
for
 
the
 
adult
 
children.
 
The
 
surveys
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
in
 
person
 
with
 
the
 
older
 
adult
 
residents.
 
The
 
adult
 
children
 
will
 
complete
 
all
 
of
 
their
 
surveys
 
online
 
through
 
clicking
 
on
 
a
 
Qualtrics
 
link
 
sent
 
to
 
their
 
email.
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_63779] TRAINING AND TRACKING 
To ensure consistent administration of the intervention, fidelity will be monitored through structured 
observation
 
of
 
the
 
sessions
 
(VR
 
and
 
Zoom)
 
and
 
standardized
 
procedures
 
for
 
survey
 
administration.
 
For
 
VR
 
sessions,
 
we
 
will
 
collect
 
information
 
to
 
confirm
 
adherence
 
to
 
the
 
session
 
protocol,
 
including
 
session
 
duration,
 
participant
 
engagement,
 
and
 
any
 
technological
 
challenges
 
encountered
 
(such
 
as
 
WiFi
 
outages
 
in
 
the
 
community
 
or
 
adult
 
child’s
 
home).
 
Resident
 
and
 
adult
 
child
 
surveys
 
will
 
be
 
monitored
 
for
 
completeness,
 
response
 
rates,
 
and
 
all
 
research
 
assistants
 
will
 
be
 
carefully
 
trained
 
in
 
survey
 
administration
 
to
 
ensure
 
accurate
 
data
 
collection.

6.4 Study Intervention/Experimental Manipulation Adherence
 
Participant adherence to the intervention will be tracked through weekly monitoring of technology 
session
 
attendance.
 
While
 
sessions
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
intended
 
schedule,
 
flexibility
 
is
 
allowed
 
for
 
health-related
 
absences
 
or
 
travel,
 
with
 
sessions
 
rescheduled
 
as
 
needed
 
to
 
maintain
 
engagement. 
   Survey completion is a required component of adherence monitoring. Residents will complete surveys 
with
 
researchers
 
to
 
ensure
 
data
 
accuracy.
 
Adult
 
children
 
will
 
be
 
verbally
 
reminded
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
session
 
to
 
complete
 
their
 
surveys.
 
Researchers
 
will
 
monitor
 
survey
 
completeness
 
and
 
provide
 
up
 
to
 
three
 
reminders
 
via
 
text,
 
call,
 
and/or
 
email
 
to
 
encourage
 
adult
 
child
 
participants
 
to
 
complete
 
their
 
surveys. 
   Study adherence records, including session attendance and survey completion tracking, will be 
maintained
 
to
 
assess
 
participant
 
engagement
 
and
 
intervention
 
adherence
 
throughout
 
the
 
study.

8 Study Assessments and Procedures
 
8.1 Endpoint and Other Non-Safety Assessments 
Screening and Eligibility Assessment Screening procedures will be conducted prior to enrollment to determine participant eligibility. The 
screening
 
process
 
will
 
include:
 
●
 
A
 
review
 
of
 
inclusion
 
and
 
exclusion
 
criteria
 
to
 
ensure
 
eligibility
 
●
 
A
 
cognitive
 
assessment
 
using
 
a
 
validated
 
tool
 
(e.g.,
 
Mini-Mental
 
State
 
Examination

8.3.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
Any adverse event that: (a) results in death, (b) is life threatening, or  places the participant at immediate 
risk
 
of
 
death
 
from
 
the
 
event
 
as
 
it
 
occurred,
 
(c)
 
requires
 
or
 
prolongs 
 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],
 
(d)
 
causes
 
persistent
 
or
 
significant
 
disability
 
or
 
incapacity,
 
(e)
 
results
 
in
 
congenital
 
anomalies 
 
or
 
birth
 
defects,
 
(f)
 
is
 
another
 
condition
 
which
 
investigators
 
judge
 
to
 
represent
 
significant
 
hazards.
 
8.3.3 Classification of an Adverse Event 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Event Events will be rated as either mild (symptoms are easily tolerated and are of minor type causing  no loss 
of
 
time
 
from
 
normal
 
activities;
 
symptoms
 
do
 
not
 
require
 
medical
 
or
 
therapeutic
 
intervention;
 
symptoms
 
are
 
transient),
 
moderate
 
(events
 
introduce
 
a
 
low
 
level
 
of
 
inconvenience
 
or
 
concern
 
to
 
the 
 
participant
 
and
 
may
 
interfere
 
with
 
daily
 
activities,
 
but
 
are
 
usually
 
improved
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58551]; 
 
may
 
cause
 
some
 
interference
 
with
 
functioning),
 
or
 
severe
 
(events
 
interrupt
 
the
 
participant’s
 
normal
 
daily
 
activities
 
and
 
require
 
systemic
 
psychological
 
or
 
medical
 
treatment;
 
usually
 
incapacitating)
 [IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Study Intervention/Experimen tal Manipulation All events will be assessed as to the likelihood that they are related to the study intervention  and/or 
participation.
 
Categories
 
are:
 
definitely
 
related
 
(the
 
adverse
 
event
 
is
 
clearly
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
investigational
 
procedure),
 
possibly
 
related
 
(the
 
adverse
 
event
 
follows
 
a
 
reasonable
 
temporal
 
sequence 
 
from
 
administration
 
of
 
the
 
intervention
 
but
 
could
 
readily
 
have
 
been
 
produced
 
by
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
other
 
factors),
 
not
 
related
 
(the
 
adverse
 
event
 
is
 
clearly
 
not
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
intervention,
 
another
 
cause
 
is
 
most
 
plausible;
 
and/or
 
a
 
plausible
 
temporal
 
sequence
 
is
 
inconsistent
 
with
 
the
 
onset
 
of
 
the
 
event
 
and
 
the
 
intervention
 
and/or
 
a
 
causal
 
relationship
 
is
 
considered
 
biologically
 
or
 
psychologically
 
implausible).
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Expect edness All AEs will be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or unexpected, meaning  not 
anticipated
 
based
 
on
 
current
 
knowledge
 
found
 
in
 
the
 
protocol
 
and
 
described
 
in
 
study
 
related
 
forms
 
and

Categories
 
are:
 
unexpected
 
-
 
nature
 
or
 
severity
 
of
 
the

is
 
not
 
consistent
 
with
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
under
 
study

8.3.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-Up 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study
 
personnel
 
during
 
study
 
visits
 
and
 
post-study
 
interviews. 
   Strict procedures will be followed for collecting and reporting of adverse events and unanticipated 
problems.
 
All
 
AEs,
 
SAEs,
 
and
 
unanticipated
 
problems
 
(UPs)
 
will
 
be
 
collected
 
on
 
an
 
Adverse
 
Event
 
Form
 
in
 
both
 
paper
 
and
 
electronic
 
format.
 
Paper
 
forms
 
will
 
be
 
completed
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58552] – v4.0 2018-12-12 34  
 Technology and Family Thriving Study (Thriv e) Version 1.0 Protocol NIH 13336607 16 March 2025  following the study session in which the event occurred, or immediately after the adverse event comes 
to
 
their
 
attention
 
(through
 
personal
 
communication
 
from
 
a
 
study
 
participant,
 
family
 
member,
 
or
 
residential
 
community
 
staff).
 
Information
 
on
 
the
 
paper
 
forms
 
will
 
then
 
be
 
transferred
 
to
 
the
 
digital
 
form
 
within
 
24
 
hours.
 
PIs
 
(Afifi
 
and
 
Collins)
 
will
 
receive
 
an
 
immediate
 
alert
 
whenever
 
an
 
electronic
 
Adverse
 
Event
 
Form
 
is
 
submitted.
 
Afifi
 
and
 
Collins
 
will
 
be
 
responsible
 
for
 
classifying
 
adverse
 
events
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
severity,
 
expectedness,
 
and
 
potential
 
relatedness
 
to
 
the
 
study,
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
recorded
 
on
 
the
 
Adverse
 
Event
 
Form. 
   PIs will record events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until the last 
day
 
of
 
study
 
participation.
 
At
 
each
 
study
 
visit,
 
researchers
 
will
 
carefully
 
monitor
 
for
 
any
 
AEs.
 
AEs
 
will
 
be
 
followed
 
for
 
outcome
 
information
 
until
 
resolution
 
or
 
stabilization.
 
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_63784]
 
(and
 
safeguards
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
implemented),
 
we
 
anticipate
 
that
 
AEs
 
will
 
be
 
rare
 
and
 
mild.
 
However,
 
if
 
we
 
discover
 
that
 
AEs
 
occur
 
with
 
greater
 
frequency
 
than
 
expected,
 
or
 
are
 
more
 
severe
 
than
 
expected,
 
then
 
we
 
will
 
classify
 
them
 
as
 
UPs,
 
which
 
will
 
trigger
 
expedited
 
reporting
 
and
 
collaboration
 
with
 
IRB
 
and
 
NIH
 
staff.
 
All
 
AEs
 
and
 
UPs
 
will
 
be
 
reported
 
to

and
 
in
 
the

9.2 Sample Size Determination
 
Power analysis approach: The approach to estimating power was to use simulation methods. Using this 
approach,
 
the
 
hypothesized
 
population
 
model
 
and
 
its
 
associated
 
model
 
parameters
 
are
 
used
 
to
 
randomly
 
generate
 
data
 
for
 
the
 
study,
 
including
 
sampling
 
variability.
 
Data
 
are
 
generated
 
thousands
 
of
 
times,
 
simulating
 
thousands
 
of
 
hypothetical
 
studies,
 
and
 
then
 
summarized
 
to
 
explore
 
how
 
many
 
of
 
the
 
simulated
 
studies
 
contain
 
the
 
parameter
 
of
 
interest.
 
The
 
proportion
 
of
 
time
 
each
 
individual
 
effect
 
is
 
significant
 
across
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
simulations
 
is
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
that
 
effect
 
or
 
the
 
expected
 
number
 
of
 
times
 
one
 
would
 
observe
 
that
 
effect
 
to
 
be
 
significant
 
if
 
an
 
alternative
 
hypothesis
 
was
 
true
 
in
 
the
 
population.
 
This
 
approach
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
way
 
to
 
estimate
 
power
 
in
 
this
 
study
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
complexity
 
of
 
the
 
statistical
 
models
 
needed
 
to
 
estimate
 
the
 
treatment
 
effects,
 
that
 
account
 
for
 
the
 
dyadic
 
relationship
 
(resident-adult
 
child)
 
and
 
the
 
longitudinal
 
repeated
 
measures
 
of
 
the
 
outcomes
 
of
 
interest
 
(7
 
time
 
points).
 
We
 
used
 
the
 
simulation
 
facilities
 
in
 
Mplus
 
(version
 
8.3)
 
to
 
estimate
 
the
 
models. 
   To address the proposed aims, which involve dyadic longitudinal models, some with mediation, the 
power
 
analysis
 
relied
 
heavily
 
on
 
the
 
Phase
 
[ADDRESS_63786]
 
(including
 
within-group
 
changes
 
in
 
well-being
 
over
 
time,
 
baseline
 
to
 
VR).
 
This
 
helps
 
provide
 
a
 
starting
 
point
 
for
 
the
 
simulated
 
datasets.
 
These
 
models,
 
however,
 
are
 
quite
 
complex
 
and
 
involve
 
model
 
parameters
 
for
 
which
 
the
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58498].
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58499]
 
a
 
control
 
group.
 
To
 
be
 
conservative,
 
the
 
power
 
analysis
 
used
 
conservative
 
estimates
 
of
 
effect
 
sizes
 
for
 
models
 
that
 
included
 
differences
 
between
 
VR
 
and
 
the
 
control
 
group
 
(e.g.,
 
d
 
=
 
0.2).
 
To
 
determine
 
power,
 
the
 
analysis
 
focused
 
on
 
power
 
of
 
the
 
treatment
 
impact
 
for
 
a
 
given
 
aim
 
(e.g.,
 
the
 
hypothesized
 
increase
 
in
 
 NIH Protocol Templa te for Beha vioral and Social Sciences Resear ch Involving Humans – v4.0 2018-12-12 37  
 Technology and Family Thriving Study (Thriv e) Version 1.0 Protocol NIH 13336607 16 March 2025  quality of life for those in the VR condition for Aim 1, both concurrently and over time), while varying 
other
 
model
 
parameters
 
that
 
affect
 
power
 
(e.g.,
 
standard
 
error
 
of
 
random
 
intercepts
 
and
 
error
 
variance)
 
and
 
exploring
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
sample
 
size.
 
That
 
is,
 
simulations
 
considered
 
different
 
sample
 
sizes,
 
variances,
 
and
 
standard
 
errors,
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
planned
 
sample
 
size
 
was
 
a
 
large
 
enough
 
sample
 
to
 
provide
 
sufficient
 
power
 
across
 
all
 
study
 
aims.
 
It
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
there
 
are
 
many
 
parameters
 
for
 
which
 
there
 
was
 
no
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58480],
 
so
 
conservative
 
parameter
 
estimates
 
(e.g.,
 
moderately
 
large
 
standard
 
errors
 
and
 
small
 
betas)
 
were
 
used
 
for
 
simulation
 
purposes
 
to
 
ensure
 
sufficient
 
power.
 
In
 
many
 
aims,
 
the
 
effect
 
of
 
the
 
treatment
 
includes
 
both
 
concurrent
 
comparisons
 
across
 
VR
 
and
 
the
 
control
 
(Zoom)
 
and
 
longitudinal
 
differences,
 
which
 
were
 
computed
 
using
 
random
 
effects. 
   Power analysis results: Sample size was determined by a joint consideration of the (a) expected range of 
effect
 
sizes
 
across
 
the
 
outcome
 
variables,
 
(b)
 
the
 
planned
 
data
 
analytic
 
strategy,
 
and
 
©
 
the
 
expected
 
attrition
 
rate.
 
Because
 
of
 
the
 
complexity
 
of
 
the
 
research
 
design
 
and
 
range
 
of
 
hypotheses
 
to
 
be
 
tested,
 
initial
 
sample
 
size
 
estimates
 
were
 
focused
 
on
 
ensuring
 
a
 
high
 
level
 
of
 
power
 
for
 
detecting
 
effects
 
of
 
the
 
experimental
 
manipulation
 
of
 
VR
 
versus
 
control
 
(Zoom)
 
on
 
the
 
outcomes.
 
Based
 
on
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58500]-being
 
of
 
resident-adult
 
child
 
dyads
 
(similar
 
to
 
the
 
procedure
 
in
 
the
 
current
 
study),
 
we
 
estimated
 
the
 
range
 
of
 
the
 
parameters
 
from
 
that
 
sample
 
when
 
possible. 
   The planned sample size needed to detect an effect size corresponds to the smallest of these effect sizes 
as
 
our
 
minimal
 
detectable
 
effect
 
of
 
interest
 
–
 
a
 
conservative
 
strategy
 
that
 
would
 
give
 
us
 
adequate
 
power.
 
Various
 
simulation
 
studies
 
were
 
run,
 
varying
 
sample
 
size,
 
effect
 
size
 
of
 
concurrent
 
differences
 
and
 
longitudinal
 
differences,
 
and
 
other
 
model
 
characteristics
 
related
 
to
 
power
 
(e.g.,
 
error
 
variance
 
and
 
variance
 
of
 
the
 
random
 
effects).
 
While
 
the
 
models
 
for
 
each
 
aim
 
vary
 
in
 
their
 
specific
 
effects,
 
there
 
are
 
similarities
 
across
 
them.
 
The
 
moderating
 
effects
 
of
 
cognitive
 
impairment
 
are
 
the
 
most
 
specific
 
effects,
 
which
 
would
 
lend
 
itself
 
to
 
lower
 
power.
 
Thus,
 
these
 
models
 
were
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
lower
 
bound
 
for
 
power
 
in
 
this
 
grant
 
and
 
guided
 
the
 
decision
 
on 
 
sample
 
size,
 
because
 
if
 
these
 
ML-SEM
 
models
 
with
 
moderation
 
had
 
sufficient
 
power,
 
we
 
can
 
be
 
confident
 
that
 
our
 
other
 
proposed
 
analyses
 
would
 
be
 
sufficiently
 
powered.  
   We specified a ML-SEM model that included a random effects regression model. We modeled the 
moderation 
 
by
 
[CONTACT_58554]
 
(4
 
conditions:
 
treatment
 
group
 
x
 
cognitive
 
impairment)
 
on
 
its
 
prediction
 
of
 
the
 
fixed
 
effect
 
of
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
for
 
the
 
Resident
 
in
 
T2-T5
 
and
 
T6-T7.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
estimated
 
concurrent 
 
differences
 
across
 
the
 
four
 
conditions,
 
conservatively
 
estimating
 
that
 
the
 
effect
 
was
 
small
 
across
 
time
 
(d
 
=
 
.2).
 
Using
 
parameter
 
constraints,
 
power
 
was
 
studied
 
for
 
concurrent
 
differences
 
between
 
VR
 
and
 
control
 
(e.g.,
 
at
 
a 
 
given
 
time
 
point)
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
sustained
 
gains
 
over
 
time
 
between
 
VR
 
and
 
Control.
 
 
We
 
computed
 
that
 
a
 
sample
 
size
 
of
 
192
 
dyads
 
(96
 
in
 
VR
 
condition,
 
96
 
in
 
control)
 
evenly
 
split
 
between
 
cognitive
 
impairment
 
(
MCI
 
vs.
 
dementia
)
 
will
 
achieve
 
a
 
high
 
level
 
of
 
power
 
(.85)
 
for
 
detecting
 
the
 
minimal
 
expected
 
effect
 
size
 
across
 
the
 
different
 
analytic
 
approaches
 
considered.
 
Assuming
 
an
 
attrition
 
rate
 
of
 
approximately
 
15%
 
across
 
the
 
4-month
 
longitudinal
 
study,
 
we
 
calculated
 
a
 
required
 
initial
 
sample
 
size
 
of
 
no
 
less
 
than
 
[ADDRESS_63787]
 
analyses
 
the
 
dyad
 
will
 
be
 
treated
 
as
 
the
 
unit
 
of
 
analysis
 
for
 
assignment
 
to
 
experimental
 
conditions
 
and
 
will
 
be
 
modeled
 
accordingly
 
in
 
all
 
statistical
 
analyses.
 
The
 
results
 
of
 
the
 
simulation
 
study
 
reveal
 
that
 
an
 
effective
 
sample
 
size
 
of
 
192
 
dyads
 
will
 
provide
 
high
 
power
 
(85%)
 
for
 
detecting
 
even
 
relatively
 
small
 
effects
 
of
 
the
 
VR
 
condition
 
over
 
control
 
(Zoom),
 
which
 
we

will
 
occur.

Populations
 
for
 
Analyses
 
 Participants will be older adults with mild cognitive impairments (MCI) or mild to moderate Alzheimer's 
Disease
 
or
 
related
 
dementias
 
(ADRD)
 
who
 
reside
 
in
 
senior
 
living
 
communities
 
and
 
an
 
adult
 
child
 
who
 
lives
 
at
 
a
 
distance.
 
Dyads
 
will
 
be
 
randomly
 
assigned
 
to
 
one
 
of
 
two
 
treatment
 
conditions
 
(video
 
chat
 
vs.
 
virtual
 
reality).
 
 
All
 
participants
 
who
 
are
 
enrolled
 
in
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
complete
 
the
 
baseline
 
assessment
 
will
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
primary
 
analyses
 
regardless
 
of
 
whether
 
they
 
complete
 
all
 
components
 
of
 
the
 
intervention.
 
 
 
9.4 Statistical Analyses
 
9.4.1 General Approach 
Primary analyses will be based on an Intent-to-Treat (ITT) approach in which all randomized participants 
will
 
be
 
analyzed
 
according
 
to
 
their
 
assigned
 
treatment
 
group,
 
regardless
 
of
 
completion
 
of
 
the
 
intervention.
 
Primary
 
analyses
 
will
 
be
 
performed
 
on
 
the
 
ITT
 
population
 
using
 
appropriate
 
statistical
 
models
 
to
 
compare
 
treatment
 
groups.
 
Secondary
 
analyses
 
will
 
evaluate
 
additional
 
outcomes
 
and
 
mediation

Missing
 
data
 
will
 
be
 
handled
 
using
 
appropriate
 
statistical
 
techniques
 
including
 
linear
 
models
 
with
 
maximum
 
likelihood
 
estimation.
 
Additional
 
exploratory
 
analyses
 
may
 
be
 
conducted
 
to
 
explore
 
trends,
 
identify
 
potential
 
moderator
 
variables,
 
and
 
generate
 
hypotheses
 
for
 
future
 
research.
 
These
 
results
 
will
 
be
 
interpreted
 
cautiously.
 
All
 
analyses
 
will
 
be
 
performed
 
using
 
validated
 
statistical
 
software
 
(SPSS,

9.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Endpoint(s) 
The longitudinal dataset including survey and observational data will enable both between and within 
participant
 
tests
 
of
 
the
 
hypotheses
 
outlined.
 
The
 
data
 
collected
 
will
 
have
 
three
 
levels
 
of
 
nestedness:
 
repeated
 
measures
 
over
 
time
 
(Level
 
1),
 
nested
 
within
 
person
 
(either
 
older
 
adult
 
or
 
adult
 
child;
 
Level
 
2),
 
nested
 
within
 
intervention
 
group
 
(VR
 
vs.
 
Control;
 
Level
 
3).
 
For
 
some
 
analyses
 
(e.g.,
 
Aim
 
1
 
and
 
2),
 
we
 
would
 
not
 
estimate
 
the
 
dyad
 
together
 
since,
 
for
 
example,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
specific
 
hypotheses
 
about
 
how
 
the
 
resident
 
and
 
the
 
adult
 
child
 
will
 
differ
 
from
 
each
 
other
 
over
 
time
 
and
 
because
 
the
 
parent
 
and
 
adult
 
child
 
will
 
complete
 
somewhat
 
different
 
measures.
 
Outcomes
 
related
 
to
 
Aim
 
1
 
and
 
Aim2
 
will
 
be
 
assessed
 
with
 
linear
 
mixed-models
 
and,
 
where
 
appropriate,
 
with
 
multilevel
 
structural
 
equation
 
modeling
 
(ML-SEM).
 
ML-SEM
 
merges
 
traditional
 
multilevel
 
modeling,
 
which
 
can
 
accommodate
 
hierarchical
 
data,
 
with
 
structural
 
equation
 
modeling
 
(SEM)
 
techniques,
 
which
 
can
 
accommodate
 
multiple
 
outcomes
 
and
 
mediators,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
latent
 
variables.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
analytic
 
approach
 
for
 
some
 
hypotheses
 
tests
 
(e.g.,
 
tests
 
of
 
mediation
 
and
 
tests
 
of
 
dyadic
 
models)
 
will
 
be
 
multilevel
 
structural
 
equation
 
modeling
 
(ML-SEM)
 
in
 
Mplus
 
(or
 
R)
 
to
 
simultaneously
 
estimate
 
a
 
within-
 
and
 
between-person
 
model,
 
accounting
 
for
 
individual
 
change
 
over
 
time
 
and
 
the
 
treatment
 
effect
 
at
 
the
 
between-person
 
level.
 
Using
 
parameter
 
constraints,
 
analyses
 
will
 
examine
 
concurrent
 
differences
 
between
 
VR
 
and
 
control
 
(e.g.,
 
at
 
a
 
given
 
time
 
point)
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
sustained
 
gains
 
across
 
VR
 
and
 
control
 
using
 
an
 
approach
 
similar
 
to
 
contrast
 
coding.

  [IP_ADDRESS] Consen t Proc edures and Documen tation 1: Once identified, potentially eligible residents will be invited to talk with the researchers (in person) to 
determine
 
if
 
they
 
are
 
interested
 
in
 
participating,
 
and
 
verify
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
eligible
 
to

The
 
researchers
 
will
 
explain
 
the
 
purpose
 
and
 
procedures
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
gather
 
initial

At
 
this
 
time,
 
researchers
 
will
 
administer
 
the
 
MMSE-2
 
to
 
verify
 
eligibility.
 
If
 
a
 
resident’s
 
ability
 
to
 
consent
 
is
 
uncertain,
 
the
 
researcher
 
will
 
complete
 
an

Researchers
 
will
 
call
 
the

will
 
be
 
valuable
 
because

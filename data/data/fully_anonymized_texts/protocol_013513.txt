Research Title:
 
  Effects of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) and Bio Electro -Magnetic Energy 
Regulation (BEMER) Therapy on neck pain in adults.  
Research Purpose: 
  The purpose of this project is to investigate the individual and combined effects of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) and Bio Electro -Magnetic Energy Regulation (BEMER) Therapy 
on neck pain in adults. 
Study Summary:
 
  
Neck pain is a prevalent complaint made by [CONTACT_292480] [1, 2]. Many treatment approaches exist depending on the specific etiology, however, there still remains a need for more conclusive evidence regarding many treatment strategies [3 -6]. 
Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) is commonly utilized for an array of musculoskeletal and various other complications including neck pain. Goals of this treatment strategy include myofascial tissue release, decreased pain, and increased range of mo tion. 
Bio Electro -Magnetic Energy Regulation (BEMER) therapy is a therapeutic modality that deploys 
a biorhythmically defined stimulus through a Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF), which leads to an increase in blood flow. The positive effects of BEMER on the circulation has been shown to result in significant increases in arteriovenous oxygen difference, number of open capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], arteriolar and venular flow volume, and flow rate of red blood cells in the microvasculature [7, 8]. BEMER with physiotherapy has shown reduction in pain and fatigue acutely in patients with chronic low back pain [9]. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials that investigated whether PEMF was effective in low back pain showed there was a decrease in pain intensity and improved functionality in individuals with different low back pain conditions [10].   
By [CONTACT_7652], it is plausible that the combination of OMT and BEMER therapy may help increase circulation to myofascial structures that influence neck restriction and pain. The purpose 
3 
 of this study is to investigate the individual and combined effects of OMT and BEMER therapy 
on neck pain.   
Review of Literature:  
Neck pain is estimated to have a prevalence of 30% annually and perhaps, affect 70% of patients 
at some point in their life [1, 2]. Neck pain has become a very important public health problem, and social issue due to its high prevalence, unsatisfactory treatment options, large medical burden, and reduction in quality of life [11]. In fact, neck pain ranks fourth worldwide as a cause of Years Lived with Disability [12]. Many complaints of acute or chronic neck pain are musculoskeletal in nature and present w ith significant muscular tension in the neck, which may restrict blood flow. 
Neck pain can result from a variety of etiologies, including postural, neurological and mechanical causes such as   muscle strains, joint damage, and nerve compression [2]. Several treatment options 
are currently available for the various causes of neck pai n such as nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory 
and steroid pharmacotherapy, surgery, and an array of more conservative treatments including Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT). Palpation of the posterior and anterior neck muscles for tissue texture changes and tender points can assist in the diagnosis of cervical dysfunctions [13]. The upper cervical and upper thoracic regions can contribute to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction through the continuity of fascia. The utilization of OMT on these somatic  
dysfunctions can be greatly beneficial to these patients. Dysfunction of the occiput and atlas is associated with the temporal bone and these tender points located between the ramus of the mandible and mastoid process can be effectively treated with counterstrain, which is an osteopathic manipulative technique [13]. 
There have been conflicting reports that investigated the effects of spi[INVESTIGATOR_197974] (an 
osteopathic manipulative technique) on neck pain [1, 14- 22]. For example, patients with acute and 
subacute neck pain who received treatment with spi[INVESTIGATOR_292457] 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks, proving to be more effective for both short and long term pain relief [1]. On the other hand, Fredin & Loras suggested that combined treatment consisting of manipulation therapy and exercise therapy does not seem to be more effective in reducing neck pain intensity at rest, neck disability or improving quality of life in adult patients with grade I -II neck pain, than exercise therapy alone [18]. These 
discrepancies may be explained by [CONTACT_292481], duration of the intervention, and characteristics of the sample population. It is clear that additional research investigating the effects of alternative treatments on neck pain is warranted.  
Specific OMT approaches have been studied for the treatment of patients presenting with neck pain, but substantially less than other general complaints such as lower back pain [3, 23, 24]. In one study, it was demonstrated that treating somatic dysfunction of the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_292458] [21].The authors concluded that OMT is a reasonable alter native to parenteral nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medication for 
patients with acute neck pain [21]. In addition, a specific osteopathic manipulative treatment called muscle energy has been shown to provide significant relief of neck pain and improve cer vical 
range of motion [20]. Although there is some evidence to suggest OMT may be an alternative to the treatment of neck pain [20, 21], there is a clear need to better understand the effects of OMT specifically on subacute and chronic neck pain.

 Bio-Electro-Magnetic- Energy-Regulation (BEMER) therapy is a therapeutic modality that 
deploys a biorhythmically defined stimulus through a Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF), 
which leads to an increase in blood flow. The positive effects of BEMER on the circulation has been shown to result in significant increases in arteriovenous oxygen difference, number of open capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], arteriolar and venular flow volume, and flow rate of red blood cells in the microvasculature [7, 8]. Although there has not been any studies on the effects of BEMER on neck pain, BEMER with physiotherapy has shown reduction in pain and fatigue acutely in patients with chronic low back pain [9]. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials that investigated whether PEMF was effective in low back pain showed there was a decrease in pain intensity and improved functionality in individuals with different low back pain conditions [10].  By [CONTACT_292482], it is plausible that the combination of OMT and BEMER therapy may help increase  
circulation to myofascial structures that influence neck restriction and pain. With promising evidence, there remains ample opportunity to study treatment modalities and the use of complementary techniques and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_292459] [4, 6, 16]. The purpose of this study is to investigate the individual and combined effects of OMT and BEMER therapy on neck pain.   
In summary, there is generally moderate and favorable evidence supporting the utility of OMT, 
and a growing body of evidence regarding BEMER therapy. However, plentiful literature also indicates the need for further exploration of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_292460], 
and their effect on neck pain. It is a goal of this project to further investigate the effects of individual and combined therapi[INVESTIGATOR_14953] a controlled, single-blinded study.

LECOM-Bradenton. 
4.
     Explanation of each Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) technique and 
screening tests  
a)     Myofascial release (MFR) is a system of diagnosis and treatment which engages 
continual palpatory feedback to achieve release of myofascial tissues [25]. MFR can be performed in a direct or indirect manner. If direct MFR is being performed the area of myof ascial tissue restriction is engaged for the myofascial tissues and 
the tissue is loaded with a constant force until tissue release occurs. If indirect MFR 
[ADDRESS_356901] obstruction until free movement is achieved. For this study, the student doctors will perform MFR in the suboccipi[INVESTIGATOR_292466]. 
b)
    Soft tissue (ST) is a system of diagnosis and treatment directed toward tissues 
other than bony or joint origins [25]. Soft tissue technique involves direct engagement of myofascial tissues and is applied with lateral stretching, linear stretching, deep pressure, traction and/or separation of muscle origin and insertion while monitoring tissue response and motion changes by [CONTACT_23302]. Soft tissue techniques will be applied to the cervical and thoracic regions in this study. c)
     Muscle energy (ME) is a form of osteopathic manipulative diagnosis and 
treatment in which the patient’s muscles are actively used on request, from a precisely controlled position, in a specific direction, and against a distinctly executed physician counterforce [25]. We will use muscle energy technique in the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_292467]. d)
    Counterstrain (CS) technique is a system of diagnosis and treatment that 
considers the dysfunction to be a continuing, inappropriate muscle/tendon/ligament strain reflex, which is stopped by [CONTACT_2931] a position of mild strain in the direction exactly oppos ite to that of the reflex; this is accomplished by [CONTACT_292486] [25].  We will screen for counterstrain tender points associated with medial 
pterygoid, sternocleidomastoid, Suboccipi[INVESTIGATOR_292468]. These muscles have attachments to the temporal bone, mandible, occiput, cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and clavicle and have been postulated to be a contributing factor to musculoskeletal causes of neck pain [26]. e)
     Articulatory treatment (ART) is a low -velocity-to high-amplitude technique 
where a joint is carried through its full motion with the therapeutic goal of increased 
freedom with range of movement. The activating force is either a springing motion or repetitive concentric movement of the joint through the restrictive barrier. The technique may be direct, indirect, or combined, and there can be a variation of 
rhythms, amplitude, or acceleration catered to the patient’s presentation. This technique is indicated when there is presence of articular or myofascial somatic dysfunction, as well as circulatory and lymphatic congestion [25]. In this study student doctors will use an articulatory technique to treat a 1
st rib elevation 
dysfunction. f)
     Spurling’s Test/Maneuver - This test will assess for cervical nerve root irritation 
or compression. The test is performed with the subject in the seated position. The evaluating student will then place the subjects head and neck in an extended and sidebent position towards one side. Once in this position, a gentle but deliberate 
compressive force will be applied from the top of the subjects head. If this maneuver produces a radicular pain in a distinct dermatomal pattern down the affected sides upper  extremity then the test is considered positive. A positive test 
will exclude the subject from the study. The test is performed bilaterally [10]. g)
    Wallenberg test - This test will assess for possible vertebral artery 
insufficiency.  The test is performed with the subject in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. The 
evaluating student will then place the subjects head and neck in an extended 
[ADDRESS_356902] complains of dizziness, visual changes, lightheadedness and/or the evaluating student notes eye nystagmus then this is considered a positive test. A positive test will exclude the subject from the study. 
The test is performed bilaterally [27]. 
E.
    Bio Electro -Magnetic Energy Regulation (BEMER) 
1.     Protocol 
a)     Subject will lay supi[INVESTIGATOR_292469], and place the B.Pad® on their 
cervical neck.   BEMER mat intensity 3 will be selected in week 1, intensity 4 for 
week 2, and intensity 5 for week 3.  B.Pad® will be set at Program [ADDRESS_356903] approximately 15-25 minutes. 
2.     Explanation of BEMER 
a)     BEMER is a therapeutic modality that deploys a biorhythmically defined 
stimulus through Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF).  This stimulus has a 
targeted effect on the microvasculature, and the primary effect is an improvement in tissue microcirculation [ 9]. The positive effects of vasomotion (i.e. opening of 
the blood vessels) on the microcirculation has been shown to result in significant increases in arteriovenous oxygen difference, number of open capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], arteriolar and venular flow volume, and flow rate of red blood cells in the microvasculature [7, 8]. Therefore, BEMER can potentially be used in the treatment of neck pain by [CONTACT_292487]. Last year we have successfully utilized the BEMER therapy without any adverse effects in a prior study on low back pain. 
F.
    Placebo 
1.     Placebo (Combined light touch and BEMER Sham): Treaters will place their hands 
lightly on the subject's cervical paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_292470], and on the subjects upper thoracic paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_292471] (approximately 5 minutes). However, no pressure or action will be done. In addition, the subject will lie down on the BEMER mat (as they would do during a BEMER session), but the device will not be activated. This treatment will be used as a control. 
G.
   The research assistants will individually coordinate experimental times with the 
subjects.  A licensed osteopathic physician will be in the vicinity of the treatment location 
at all times while treatments are being given.  
H.   OMT, BEMER, and placebo will be performed by [CONTACT_292488] a licensed osteopathic physician to ensure uniform technique.  A licensed osteopathic physician will be in the vicinity of the treatme nt 
location at all times while treatments are being given.  
I.
      All data collection logs will be de -identified of personal information and only contain 
the randomized participant ID number linking the participant to the data collected. J.
     The identifying information will be maintained by [CONTACT_39548][INVESTIGATOR_2993]cipal [INVESTIGATOR_2993]vestigator [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a locked 
cabinet, which they alone have access to.

Introduction 
You are invited to take part in a research study at LECOM -Bradenton. Researchers and medical 
students at LECOM -Bradenton are investigating the individual and combined effects of 
osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) and Bio Electro -Magnetic Energy Regul ation 
(BEMER) therapy on neck pain. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is a manual, hands -
on treatment provided by a licensed physician and/or supervised medical student for the treatment of miscellaneous ailments including musculoskeletal neck pain. BEMER therapy is a therapeutic 
modality that deploys very small electric pulses that cause blood vessels to open up, and leads to an increase in blood flow; you will not feel the electric pulses as they are very small. This study may yield information that will benefit future students and could extend benefits to other members of society, especially those with severe neck pain.   
Research Methods  
The length of the study is 3 weeks.  A sample of approximately 40 participants is anticipated.   If 
you decide to participate, you will be randomly assigned one of 4 treatments groups: OMT only, BEMER only, OMT+BEMER, or Placebo OMT+BEMER. Depending on the group you are assigned, you will receive OMT treatment [ADDRESS_356914] in the OMT+BEMER group will receive OMT 3 times per week and BEMER therapy 5 times per week for a p eriod of 3 weeks; placebo treatment 
schedule will mimic the OMT+BEMER schedule. All treatments will be performed during the span of three consecutive weeks.  You will complete brief questionnaires regarding neck pain and 
quality of life before the beginning of study and will complete the same questionnaires following the completion of the three week treatment. Each treatment session should last between [ADDRESS_356915] identification numbers will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in the PI’s office for three years. This de -identified information will be kept confidential to the extent legally 
possible. All electronic s ubmissions of de -identified data will be treated in the same manner as 
stated above regarding written information. Access to this Google Drive account is exclusive to the Principal Investigator, Principal Co- Investigator and designated medical students as identified 
in the IRB.  
Subject Risks 
All research studies have some degree of risk or discomfort. In this study, you may risk feeling slight discomfort during manipulative treatment. Following the treatment, it is possible that you will feel some muscle tenderness or generalized discomfort 24 -48 hours after the session. Much 
more rarely, more serious adverse effects include: substantial injury, excessive muscle soreness, loss of consciousness, vertigo, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, and any type of numbness and tingling in arms, leg, or neck. If you experience any of these symptoms they should be brought to the attention of the supervising physician immediately. Your treatment will be performed by [CONTACT_292493], supervised by [CONTACT_292494]. Medical students will disclose their true identity to avoid any misconception that they are licensed physicians. There is little empi[INVESTIGATOR_292476] “hazards” to patients of student -
performed procedures. However, absence of confirmatory data does not mean that a risk does not exist. Considering students' inexperience, student -performed procedures would be expected to 
carry a higher risk of complication to patients (Marracino, MD & Orr, MD, 1998). After OMT therapy, muscle tenderness and generalized discomfort may be noted 24- [ADDRESS_356916] (or to the fetus/embryo if the subject is or may become pregnant) are currently unforeseeable.  
  Although OMT and BEMER therapy may be helpful in alleviating neck pain, there are several alternative treatments such as medications, physical therapy, massage therapy, and acupuncture. Any significant new findings developed during the course of research that may relate to your willingness to continue participation in the study will be provided to you.

Voluntary Consent 
 You may choose to participate or may choose not to participate. If you choose not to participate in this study there will be no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. If you choose to participate in this study you may withdraw from further participation at any time by [CONTACT_189188]. If you withdraw, there will be no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Your participation will not provide any benefit/negative impact with respect to  your status at LECOM. 
  
Data Collection  
  Data will be retrieved through four surveys: -SF-12 Health Survey. This will be an online, de -identified survey given once weekly with the 
Neck Disability Index. You will answer questions regarding overall personal wellness. -Visual Analog Pain Scale. This will be a de -identified scale administered once weekly. You will 
rate your overall neck pain on a visual scale. -Neck Disability Index. This will be an online, de -identified survey given once weekly with the 
SF-12 Health Survey. You will answer questions regarding Neck Disability. 
-OMT evaluation data and diagnostic data (Spurling’s Test and Wallenburg Test). This data will 
be collected at every OMT or OMT -Placebo treatment. This data will not be collected for the 
BEMER-only group. This data will be collected by [CONTACT_292495]. This data will be de-identified.  
     
Compensation 
Should you choose to participate, you will be compensated for your time with a $[ADDRESS_356918] the following screening tests performed prior to participating in the study: 
• Spurling’s Test/Maneuver - This test will check for nerve irritation in your neck. The test 
will take place with you in the seated position. The evaluating student will then place your head and neck in an extended and sidebent position towards one side. Once in this position, 
[ADDRESS_356919] is performed on the left and right.  
• Wallenberg test - This test will check for the openness of the vertebral artery which is in 
your neck.  The test is performed with you lying on your back. The evaluating student will 
then slowly place your head and neck in an extended position and then rotate your head and neck to one side. This position will be held for 30 seconds. If at any time you complain of dizziness, visual changes, lightheadedness and/or the evaluating student notes abnormal eye movements then this is considered a positive test. A positive test will exclude the subject from the study. The test is performed on the left and right.

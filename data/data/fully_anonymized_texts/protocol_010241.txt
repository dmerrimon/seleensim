 1. Objective  
Our objective is to determine the effectiveness of varied outreach methods (e.g.  automated reminder calls/text 
messages with or without personalized calls/texts, MyChart messaging) to children age 12 -14 months, 4 years old, 
or 6-17 years old who are due for a WCC visit and don’t have one scheduled in the next 45 days on the outcomes o f 
appointment scheduling, appointment completion, and receipt of the MMR vaccination.  
 
Background  
The Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56038] 33,000 
children.  The Pediatric Primary Care Center (PPCC), Hopple Street Health Center (HPC) and Fairfield Primary 
Care (FPC) serves an underserved population.  Annually, these practices provide over 60,[ADDRESS_188422] included reminder phone calls and/or tex ts when patients were overdue for 
well child care (WCC).  These efforts were time and resource intensive, as they required personnel to manually 
complete and document attempts. Additionally, due to high resource needs to accomplish such efforts, there has 
been no outreach to those [ADDRESS_188423] speaking to the efficacy of automated reminder (i.e. notifying parents of needed 
immunizations) and recall (i.e. notifying parents of overdue immunizations) systems, including text messag ing 
systems.1,2,[ADDRESS_188424] effective and efficient.  Differences in the timing of reminders to schedule, as 
well as the message itse lf, has been shown to make a difference in the outcomes of reaching patients or scheduling 
appointments.4 However, there remains a need for research that identifies the degree to which combinations of 
patient reminder systems improve outcomes, especially the outcome of on -time immunization, and how these 
approaches differ by [CONTACT_56040].1 
 
Following the COVI D-19 pandemic shut -down in which thousands of well child appointments were cancelled or 
delayed, the importance of a systematic outreach process became more critical.  The traditional process is non -
standardized and the efficacy of the work is both unknown  and expensive.  Our objective is to determine the 
effectiveness of varied outreach methods (e.g. automated reminder calls/text messages with or without personalized 
calls/texts, MyChart messaging) to children age 12 -14 months, 4 years old, or 6 -17 years o ld who are due for a 
WCC visit and don’t have one scheduled in the next 45 days on the outcomes of appointment scheduling, 
appointment completion, and receipt of the MMR vaccination.  
2. Design/Method  
To achieve our objective , we will conduct a 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial.  Randomization is justified 
because 1) it is a rigorous approach to answer our question and 2) we do not have the resources or appointment 
availability to personally contact [CONTACT_162389].  
 
Patient Population :  
Patients are eligible for inclusion in this study if they are in one of four eligible groups:

Automated Message : Parents indicate their preferred mode of reminder (e.g.  call or text message) when they 
schedule appointments.  Cincinnati Children’s uses a HIPAA compliant platform called TeleVox to send automated 
calls and text reminders to parents according to their preferences which are recorded in the Electronic Health R ecord 
(EHR).

texts) 
3. Parent with activated MyChart account (Y/N) (rationale: not dependent on calling scheduling center to 
make appointment)  
Outreach Methods Study Protocol & SAP  
Version 1.1, 1 /14/22  
pg. 8 
 4. Access to appointment: Number of days to 3rd next available appointment at patient’s clinic at time their 
first automated message is  sent 
5. Patient receipt of any past immunizations (Y/N) (rationale: vaccine refusing parents will be unlikely to 
change even if they return for well child check)  
6. School -age vs. adolescent patient age (rationale: adolescents less likely to get yearly check -ups) 
7. Historical no -show rate  
8. Community rates of COVID based on 7 day moving average.  
 
 
Power/Sample Size  
 
Personal Contacts (12 -14 month & 4 -year -olds) Trial:  
We based our hypotheses (see table, below) on a systematic review’s pooled estimates of effect size for automated 
messages and personalized calls finding 37% and 40% of children, respectively, completed immunizations.[ADDRESS_188433] involved in making personal contacts, the minimal difference in outcome that would 
make it wo rth the effort is high.   
 
Hypotheses  % of children who receive MMR by 15 
months of age  
 1 automated 
message sent  2 automated 
messages sent  
0 personal attempts  20% C 35% B 
1 personal attempt  50% A 65% AB 
 
We calculated sample size needed per group to detect a difference for each of the contrasts below with alpha of 0.05 
and power of 80%.  
 
Contrast  Sample Size per 
Group  
A vs C  36 
B vs C  136 
A vs. B  167 
A vs. AB  167 
B vs. AB  40 
C vs. AB  16 
 
To fully power the 2 X 2 factorial trail, we estimate needing 167 per group X 4 groups = [ADDRESS_188434] to far exceed 
the required sample size  after 3 replications.  If needed, we could increase the number of replications of the trial to 
reach the targeted sample size.  We acknowledge that we are not powered to precisely estimate any interactions 
between interventions.  
 
MyChart Trial:  
In hypothesis testing for [ADDRESS_188435] 2 messages vs. 1 message, thus the type I error rate of  
0.05 is retained. Since the hypothesis testing of 2 messages vs. 0 message would be considered easier to achieve 
than the hypothesis testing of 2 messages vs. 1 message,  the power analysis for this trial should be based on the 
design of (standard message vs.  tailored message) by (1 message vs. 2 messages). We based our hypotheses (see 
table, below) on previous work indicating approximately 20% WCC appointment completion on automated text 
reminders.  We anticipate that a tailored message increases the WCC appointment completion rate by [CONTACT_20904] 10%.  
 
Hypotheses   % of children complete WCC within 8 
weeks

We assume no difference between A vs. B and thus not consider powering the comparison between these two 
groups, but we will explore non -inferiority analysis for this comparison in data analysis. To fully power the above 
contrasts, we estimate needing 293 p er group X 4 groups = [ADDRESS_188437] to exceed the required sample si ze after 2 replications. If needed, we could 
increase the number of replications of this trial to reach the targeted sample size.  We acknowledge that we are not 
powered to precisely estimate any interactions between interventions.  
 
Televox (6 -11yo) Trial:

size.

[ADDRESS_188443] dose of COVID vaccination (age 12 -17 years) within 
[ADDRESS_188444] waiver of consent such that there i s (1) potential, minimal, risks to the participant (see below), (2) de -
identification of PHI, and (3) participation in the study will not affect current/future care received through CCHMC.  
 
All identifying information will be removed once data collection i s complete. Data will be kept securely on a 
CCHMC computer that is password protected. Any hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_56039] a private office.  
 
Facilities and Performance Sites  
Data analysis will be done on the Main Campus of CCHMC and at the CCHMC pri mary care offices (PPCC, HPC, 
FPC, and SBHCs).  
 
Potential Benefits  
The results of this study will aid CCHMC pediatric primary care centers in improving and redesigning an outreach 
system to children behind on necessary preventative services who have gaps in needed primary care.  It will identify 
the most effective ways to  reach, engage, and schedule patients for care when appropriate.  This will enable the 
primary care offices to allocate the appropriate amount of resource to outreach efforts moving forward, ensuring 
high risk children receive reminders for care.  
 
Potenti al risks, discomforts, inconveniences, and precautions  
Outreach Methods Study Protocol & SAP  
Version 1.1, 1 /14/22  
pg. 11 
 The only significant risks are breach of confidentiality and potential discomfort/inconvenience associated with 
receiving texts or phone calls indicating that care gaps exist for a child.  As noted abo ve, personal health information 
(PHI) will be obtained via the electronic medical record.  After obtaining this information, patients will be de -
identified in the created database and securely stored.  
 
Risk/Benefit analysis  
While immediate benefit to any given individual or family is unknown, this study involves minimal risk.  
 
Cost of Participation  
 
There is no cost for participation.  
 
Payment for Participation  
There is no reimbursement for participation.  
 
Request for HIPAA Waiver  
The use or disclosure of the PHI involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of individuals based on the 
presence of the following elements:  
-We plan to protect health information identifiers from improper use and disclosure by [CONTACT_56051].  
-We have an adequ ate plan to destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent with conduct of the research.  
-We ensure the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to (shared with) any other person or entity, except as required by 
[CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research for which the use or disclosure of the PHI 
would be permitted under the Privacy Rule.  
•This research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration.  
•This research could not practicably be conducte d without access to and use of the PHI.

 The results of the Outreach Methods  study will be assess ed as described in this document. This statistical analysis 
plan begins with an overview of the key components of the study, including its design, objectives, and outcomes 
measures. This is followed by a detailed description of the statistical analyses that will be utilized to address study 
hypotheses.  
1. Overview of study: This study used a multi -arm randomized control trial to test the impact of autom ated 
text/telephone messages , with and without information about COVID -19 vaccine availability, on the scheduling 
and completion of adolescent well -care visits  (AWC) . We randomized e ligible patients to the Standard Message 
group, the COVID -19 Vaccine Messa ge group, or the Control Group. We generated random allocation 
sequence stratified by [CONTACT_162391] (with a block size of 3). Based on sample size 
calculations, w e planned to enroll a minimum of [ADDRESS_188446] (EHR) from three academic pediatric primary 
care practices.  
1.1 Study Objective:  Test the effectiveness of text and telephone message s, with and without information about 
COVID -19 vaccine availability, on the scheduling and completion of  adolescent well -care visit s (AWC)  in 
adolescents due for preventative services.  
Working  hypothesis:  Twenty percent of patients in the Standard Message group, 30% of patien ts 
in the COVID -19 vaccine group, and 2% of those in the control group will complete a n adolescent 
well-care visit  within 8 weeks.  
 
1.2 Outcome measure s 
Primary

2.2.2 Missing data  
We will use data obtained from patient’s electronic health record (EHR) to calculate our primary and secondary 
outcomes. Missing outcome data could occur for several reasons, such a s errors  of medical documentation or the 
patient no longer in the primary care  registry.  
2.3 Statistical Report Contents  
The following section outlines the contents of the final statistical analysis. For all analyses,  subjects who are 
enrolled in the study and are eligible will be analyzed in the groups to which they were allocated.  
2.3.1 Description of study population  
Sample size:  
The total number of subjects who are enrolled  will be given.  
Demographics and Clinical Characteristics, Patient and Parent:  
Demographic and clinical characteristics as measured at baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_159344]. Variables to be 
summarized are: adolescent age, adolescent sex, adolescent  race, adolescent ethnicity, insurance , parent 
communication preference  absence of past patient receipt of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or diphtheria, 
tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine as a proxy for childhood vaccine refusal, and patient lifetime 
historical institutional  no-show rate . Variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics appropriate for each 
type of data item.  
Baseline c haracteristics with large differences between groups will be included in analyses  as covariates .  
2.3.2 Primary outcome analysis  
Primary  o utcome: Adolescent well -care visit completed within [ADDRESS_188458] message sent or date of 
randomization for the control group.  
o Appointment completed  (yes or no) based on electronic health record documentation  
For the primary outcome, we will use a logistic regression model to examine appointment completion within [ADDRESS_188459] additional analyses adjusted for these variables.  
2.3.3 Secondary outcome analyses  
• Adolescent well -care visit scheduled within [ADDRESS_188460] additional 
analyses adjusted for these varia bles.

2  AN INFLAMATORY CHALLENGE USING ENDOTOXIN STUDY PROTOCOL  1. INTRODUCTION  Neuroimmune factors, expressed in neurons and glia, mediate neuroinflammation and modulate a wide range of brain functions, including neuronal activity, endocrine function, and CNS development. A growing body of literature suggests that systemic inflammation leads to neuroinflammation, and alcohol exposure increases both systemic- and neural markers of inflammation. Specifically, chronic alcohol consumption is thought to produce a sustained inflammatory state, such that individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) have increased inflammation throughout the brain. Alcohol-induced inflammation has been implicated in chronic alcohol seeking as well as the behavioral and neurotoxic effects of alcohol. In rodents, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation produces prolonged increases in alcohol consumption, and knocking out immune signaling genes attenuates alcohol preference and self-administration. Thus, elucidating the role of inflammation in AUD has significant implications, including opportunities for the development of novel and potentially more effective therapeutics for AUD.   The proposed study consists of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low dose endotoxin. The low dose endotoxin challenge induces a transient systemic inflammatory response with normalization of cytokine levels within hours. This “phasic” inflammation is distinct from chronic (“tonic”) levels of inflammation that may be present with AUD.   2. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  2.1. Inflammatory signaling appears to be a key component of alcohol use disorder.  Molecular and behavioral studies suggest a central role for the innate immune system in mediating the acute and chronic effects of alcohol and generally support an inflammatory hypothesis of alcohol use disorder. Neurotrophins, including glial (GDNF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are essential for synaptic plasticity, neuron survival, and basic cell signaling, including midbrain dopamine transmission. In rodent models of AUD, reductions in GDNF and BDNF expression underlie dysfunctional striatal dopamine signaling, increased motivation to consume alcohol, and heightened alcohol reward. Conversely, increases in GDNF and BDNF signaling restores mesolimbic dopamine function, reduces alcohol self-administration, and attenuates relapse to alcohol seeking. In preclinical studies, induction of inflammation produces prolonged increases in alcohol consumption, and knocking out inflammatory signaling genes attenuates alcohol preference and self-administration. Proinflammatory signaling also mediates acute alcohol-induced motor impairment, and chronic alcohol exposure produces long-lasting increases in systemic inflammation, which in turn is associated with sustained cognitive and behavioral impairment and brain damage. Furthermore, inflammation is thought to increase vulnerability to stress-induced drug seeking and relapse.   It is hypothesized that chronic alcohol consumption produces a sustained inflammatory state, and in turn, this alcohol-induced neuroinflammation contributes to the behavioral and neurotoxic effects of alcohol. Individuals with AUD are thought to have increased neuroinflammation throughout the brain, and elevated peripheral levels of proinflammatory cytokines have been

3  proposed as a biomarker for AUD. Nevertheless, there are contrasting findings such that a recent imaging study reported that individuals with AUD exhibit less activated microglia in the brain and blunted peripheral proinflammatory response than controls. In sum, the role of inflammation in AUD remains opaque, particularly in human/clinical studies.  2.2. The literature on inflammatory signaling and AUD is overwhelmingly preclinical and translation to human clinical samples is sorely needed.  To date, the vast majority of the research implicating alcohol and inflammation has been preclinical. Human studies, however, have recently shown a positive correlation between serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and alcohol craving. While these associations are intriguing, it is crucial for the field to progress from correlational to experimental models that can effectively probe the role of neuroinflammation in AUD phenotypes in humans. This is particularly relevant given recent evidence that genomic responses to inflammation and inflammatory disease in mouse models cannot be extrapolated to the human condition, which “supports higher priority to focus on the more complex human conditions rather than rely on mouse models to study human inflammatory diseases.” To that end, we propose to conduct an inflammatory challenge in a sample of non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers and a comparison sample of light drinkers to examine the effects of systemic increases in inflammation on cue-induced craving for alcohol in the laboratory. Such endotoxin-induced increases in systemic inflammation are reported to induce neuroinflammation with glial activation in humans. Specifically, we propose to experimentally provoke an inflammatory response using low dose endotoxin derived from E. coli (E. coli group O:113:BB-IND [ZIP_CODE] to MRI) and delivered intravenously. This reference endotoxin provided by [CONTACT_683805], socioemotional processes, and depression. The proposed study will leverage these resources for a safe, effective, and well-tolerated inflammatory challenge in order to experimentally probe the role of inflammation in alcohol craving among non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers. The scientific premise of this proposal is that if inflammation plays a causal role in inducing alcohol craving, heavy drinkers will experience greater cue-induced alcohol craving following an inflammatory challenge (via endotoxin) as compared to those given a placebo challenge. In addition to a human study showing a positive correlation between serum levels of cytokines and alcohol craving, a host of preclinical studies have shown that while endotoxin administration reduces effort, it actually boosts preference for high rewards, thus advancing craving as a plausible reward-based outcome for this study.  2.3. Significance of the proposed project hinges on the premise that while evidence is accumulating that the innate immune system and inflammation contribute to AUD, the evidence is largely preclinical and translation to human clinical samples is necessary.  The findings in humans have been mostly correlational while experimental approaches that can establish a causal link between inflammation and AUD phenotypes is lacking. The proposed study fills an important gap in the literature by [CONTACT_683806] a clinical sample of non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers and light drinking healthy controls. The successful completion of the proposed study will advance the field of alcoholism by [CONTACT_683807], a translational phenotype for AUD. Results from this study will inform an R01 application in which the combination of inflammatory challenge and alcohol cue-reactivity can be used in medications

4  development applied to novel neuroimmune modulators with therapeutic potential for AUD. Notably, this approach has been successful in the psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) field.  2.4. Preliminary studies conducted by [CONTACT_5051].    The investigative team brings together expertise in the areas of clinical neuroscience of AUD (Ray), psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) (Irwin, Eisenberger), experimental psychology (Ray, Eisenberger), and clinical psychiatry (Irwin, Miotto). The team is led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lara Ray who routinely employs behavioral pharmacology approaches including intravenous alcohol administration and medications in her research. [CONTACT_346230] has a growing interest in the role of inflammation in AUD. [CONTACT_156759] is a world-expert in PNI, including a strong publication record in the intersection between PNI, sleep, and AUD, and the use of endotoxin to probe inflammation-behavior relationships. [CONTACT_683836] is a neuroscientist with a program of research on the biological underpi[INVESTIGATOR_683790], including PNI mechanisms. [CONTACT_683837] is a physician scientist who has served as the medical director for [CONTACT_346230]’s studies for the past [ADDRESS_926055]. Ray’s laboratory has ample expertise applying cue-reactivity methods to AUD. For example, in a recent publication, [CONTACT_346230] and her team examined craving for alcohol during an alcohol administration (i.e., comparing I.V. alcohol vs. placebo control) as well as during a cue-reactivity paradigm (i.e., comparing water cue vs. alcohol cue) in individuals with AUD. As shown in Figure 1, there is a main effect of alcohol administration (vs. placebo) in eliciting craving as well as a main effect of alcohol cue (versus water cue). The cue-reactivity paradigm proposed herein is consistent with those successfully implemented in [CONTACT_346230]’s laboratory, including studies of cue-reactivity among individuals with AUD. Further, we have demonstrated the safety of these procedures, by [CONTACT_683808]. More recently, we have become interested in comparing treatment-seekers to non-treatment seekers in cue-induced craving. Preliminary analyses with a sample of 29 individuals with moderate-to-severe AUD showed no significant differences in cue-reactivity between treatment-seekers (N=15) and non-treatment seekers (N=14) (F(2,28)=0.42, p= .66) (see Figure 2).

[ADDRESS_926056] of studies using endotoxin to provoke an inflammatory response. Specifically, using low dose endotoxin derived from E. coli (E. coli group O:113:BB-IND [ZIP_CODE] to MRI) and delivered intravenously, Drs. Eisenberger and Irwin demonstrated reliable increases in plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines [i.e., Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α)] which peak at [ADDRESS_926057] infusion (see Figure 3). This reference endotoxin provided by [CONTACT_683809]. The proposed study will leverage these resources for a safe, effective, and well-tolerated inflammatory challenge in order to experimentally probe the role of inflammation in alcohol craving among non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers and light drinking controls.  2.7. Acute inflammation induces neural changes detectable by [CONTACT_95425]. Translating the role of inflammation in AUD from preclinical animal models to clinical populations has been slow. Because it is the only non-invasive technique to assay the living brain, neuroimaging represents an important tool to translate findings from preclinical studies to individuals with addictive disorders [39]. Neuroimaging provides objective quantifications of brain activation, beyond what can be gathered from subjective self-report data alone [40]. Critically, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms have been used to detect alterations in the neural signal induced by [CONTACT_683810] [13, 14, 41, 42]. In healthy individuals, acute inflammation induced by [CONTACT_683811] a monetary reward, which was further associated with increases in depressed mood [14]. Acute inflammation enhanced neural activation to both positive and negative social feedback, such that endotoxin increased amygdala activation to negative social feedback and increased reward-related activation (ventral striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) to positive social feedback [13]. These studies emphasize the complexities of the role of acute inflammation in reward processing, such that the neural response to positive social feedback is potentiated whereas it is attenuated to monetary reward.    Importantly, no studies have yet investigated the effect of acute inflammation on the neural response to alcohol cues in AUD or other addictive disorders. fMRI alcohol cue-reactivity paradigms have been commonly used to evaluate if pharmacological AUD treatments alter brain activation in circuitry associated with reward processing [43, 44], and as such are sensitive to biological changes in the body as would be present in an inflammatory state. Therefore, the proposed study will fill an important gap in the literature by [CONTACT_683812] a clinical sample of non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers and light drinking healthy controls. The successful completion of the proposed study will advance the field of alcoholism by [CONTACT_683807], a translational phenotype for AUD. Results from this study will inform an R01 application in which the combination of inflammatory challenge and alcohol

Notably, this approach has been successful in the psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) field [46, 47].  3. STUDY OBJECTIVES  3.1. Primary Aims  Primary Aim #1: To test whether low dose endotoxin (0.8 ng/kg of body weight) will increase cue-induced craving for alcohol in non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers, as compared to placebo and as compared to light drinking controls. Based on the correlational findings of a positive association between proinflammatory cytokines and alcohol craving (8, 9), as well as preclinical studies (16-18), we hypothesize that endotoxin will produce greater cue-induced alcohol craving than placebo infusion.  Primary Aim #2: To test whether low dose endotoxin (0.8 ng/kg of body weight) will increase depressed mood as compared to placebo. Based on recent work by [CONTACT_83650]-Is (13), we hypothesize that endotoxin will produce greater increases in depressed mood than placebo infusion.  3.2. Exploratory Aims  Exploratory Aim #1:  To test associations between plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF- α), depressed mood, and alcohol craving during the challenge.  Exploratory Aim #2:  To examine sex differences in responses to the endotoxin challenge.  Exploratory Aim #3: To determine the effect of low dose endotoxin (0.8 ng/kg of body weight) on neural alcohol cue-reactivity.  Exploratory Aim #4: To determine the effect of low dose endotoxin (0.8 ng/kg of body weight) on reward responsiveness.  4. STUDY DESIGN  4.1. Design Overview  The study design consists of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low dose endotoxin. The low dose endotoxin challenge induces a transient systemic inflammatory response with normalization of cytokine levels within hours. This “phasic” inflammation is distinct from chronic (“tonic”) levels of inflammation that may be present with AUD. A total of 38 non-treatment seeking heavy drinking men and women and 38 light drinking healthy controls will participate in the study. Recruitment will be monitored to ensure the two groups are matched by [CONTACT_547]. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single I.V. infusion of either low dose endotoxin (0.8 ng/kg of body weight) or placebo (same volume of 0.9% saline solution) at the UCLA Outpatient Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC). All participants will complete an alcohol cue-exposure paradigm [ADDRESS_926058] infusion, which is the time of expected peak cytokine response (13, 14). Participants will complete the fMRI alcohol cue reactivity paradigm [ADDRESS_926059] infusion. Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines [i.e.,

7  Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α)], mood, reward reactivity, and alcohol craving, will be assessed at baseline and then hourly for four hours post infusion.   5.

Screening Period  5.3.1. Telephone Screen  Individuals who call the lab (in response to flyers and advertisements) expressing interest in the study will receive detailed information about the study procedures, and if they remain interested they will complete a telephone screen performed by a trained research assistant for self-reported inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those who appear eligible will be invited to the laboratory for an initial in-person screening session.   5.3.2. Initial Screening Visit  Prior to conducting any research related procedures, research staff will conduct the informed consent process, which details the procedures to take place during the screening visit. The initial screening visit may take place in-person or virtually over Zoom.  At an in-person visit, informed consent will be a three-part process. First, participants will be asked to read and provide verbal consent for breathalyzer. If the breathalyzer is above 0.000, the visit will be stopped and the participant will not be compensated.  The participant will be given an opportunity to reschedule the visit for another day.  If the breathalyzer test is negative, the written informed consent form will be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_683813] V13, April 2023 PI: [INVESTIGATOR_683789], PhD   
[ADDRESS_926061] for drugs of abuse and pregnancy (if female), and will complete a series of individual differences measures (described in detail below). This visit should take approximately [ADDRESS_926062] not consumed alcohol or any illicit substances prior to the study visit. They will not provide breathalyzer or urine samples in a virtual visit, but these elements will be included in the medical screening visit if participants are otherwise eligible. In the event of a virtual screening visit, participants will be emailed a PDF copy of the initial visit consent form. After reviewing the consent form with study staff, participants will type their names onto a signature [CONTACT_683835]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_683791].  Following the initial screening visit, the study coordinator will meet with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_683792]/exclusion criteria. A second written consent form will be reviewed and signed in the presence of the study physician or nurse practitioner at the medical screening visit if the participant is found eligible to continue to that visit.  5.3.3. Medical Screening Visit  Those participants who appear to be eligible after the initial screening visit, will then be scheduled for a second screening visit.  This visit will be conducted in the research lab and CTRC by [CONTACT_5989] (MD) or nurse practitioner (NP) and will start with a breathalyzer test. If the breathalyzer is above 0.000, the visit will be stopped and the participant will not be compensated. The participant will be given an opportunity to reschedule the visit for another day. If the breathalyzer test is negative, the MD or NP will conduct the second written (experimental) consent; medical history interview and physical exam. In addition, a urine drug screen test will be repeated. At the CTRC, a blood specimen will be collected for a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Complete Blood Count to evaluate overall health; and will obtain an EKG to screen for medical conditions that could make study participation medically unsafe.  The MD or NP will review each participant’s medical history, vital signs, weight, review of systems, and laboratory tests, including liver function tests (LFTs), drug screen, chemistry screen, and urine pregnancy screen to determine if it is medically safe for the participant to take the study medication.   Any subject who is excluded from the study will be compensated for their time in the screening session and will be offered referrals for alcohol treatment in the community.  5.4. Experimental Visit  5.4.1. Randomization  Participants who are eligible after the physical exam will be randomized to an experimental condition (i.e., endotoxin vs. placebo) within an appropriate amount of time based on study physician discretion. Urn randomization will be used to balance the two groups by [CONTACT_683814]-II severity. The UCLA Research Pharmacy will manage the blind. The two treatment conditions will not be different in appearance or method of administration. However, it is 
Endotoxin Study Protocol V13, April 2023 PI: [INVESTIGATOR_683789], PhD   
[ADDRESS_926063] decided to exclude individuals who experience severe sickness symptoms as described below (which is expected to be less than 5% of the sample). If participants are withdrawn from the study due to sickness symptoms, their data will be retained for the purposes of reporting adverse events and safety data during the trial.  Additional subjects will be recruited to replace the withdrawn individuals.    5.4.2. Inflammatory Challenge (endotoxin or matched placebo)  Upon arrival to the CTRC, eligibility for the inflammatory challenge will be reviewed to ensure that none of the exclusion criteria have been met as described above.  A nurse, who will be blind to the condition, will insert a catheter with a heparin lock into the non-dominant forearm for drug administration and hourly blood draws. Each participant will be randomly assigned to receive either low-dose endotoxin (0.8 ng/kg of body weight administered) or placebo (same volume of 0.9% saline), which will be administered by [CONTACT_683815]. The endotoxin will be derived from Escherichia coli (E. Coli group O:113: BB-IND [ZIP_CODE] to M.R.I) and will be provided by [CONTACT_683816] a reference endotoxin for studies of experimental inflammation in humans. Participants will complete assessments as outlined below at baseline and every hour for [ADDRESS_926064]. Irwin, as needed to manage adverse events. In the event that significant medical problems are encountered, the blind will be broken and appropriate medical treatment will be provided. Individuals who meet the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_683793]-related data collection procedures (cytokine assays and cue exposure paradigm): a. >[ADDRESS_926065] possibly related to endotoxin administration b. >2 Grade 3 (severe) adverse events at least possibly related to endotoxin administration, based on the FDA Guidance Document “Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials”  5.4.4. Plasma Cytokine Assays  Whole blood samples will be collected in two lavender EDTA tubes at baseline and every hour for [ADDRESS_926066]-infusion. After collection, the samples will be centrifuged at 4°C, plasma will be harvested into multiple aliquots, and then stored in a -70 °C freezer until the completion of the study. Peripheral markers of inflammation (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFNγ) will be assessed using a multiplex assay.   5.4.5. Alcohol Cue Exposure  
Endotoxin Study Protocol V13, April 2023 PI: [INVESTIGATOR_683789], PhD   
11  Participants will complete an alcohol cue-exposure paradigm at baseline (T0) during the experimental visit and again approximately 2 hours after receiving intravenous endotoxin (or matched placebo). Alcohol cue exposure will follow well-established experimental procedures. Sessions will begin with a 3-minute relaxation period. Participants will then hold and smell a glass of water for 3 minutes to control for the effects of simple exposure to any potable liquid. Next, participants will hold and smell a glass of their preferred alcoholic beverage for 3 minutes. Order is not counterbalanced because of carryover effects that are known to occur. Participants (who are smokers) will be allowed a smoke break immediately prior to and immediately after the CR assessment. After every 3 minute period, participants will rate their urge to drink on the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire.  5.4.6. Neuroimaging  Approximately 3 hours after receiving the intravenous endotoxin or matched placebo, participants will complete a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. The scan will take place at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience. Participants will be asked to lie down on a padded table, with their head placed in the center of a large, metal doughnut-shaped magnet.  While the machine is running, the participant will hear loud banging noises and will be offered earplugs to reduce the noise made by [CONTACT_40427].  Head and back support will also be provided to minimize discomfort.  During the imaging session we will utilize several structural and functional scans. The structural protocol will consist of a high-resolution, matched-bandwidth (MBW) scan and a structural magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) scan. The functional scan will include a fMRI alcohol-cue reactivity paradigm previously reported to elicit blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in mesocorticolimbic regions (Schacht et al., 2011). The visual alcohol cue reactivity paradigm is a well-validated, with strong reliability and within-participant stability (1). The alcohol cues task consists of viewing alcohol, negative and neutral cues, modified from the work of Schacht and colleagues (2011). There are four types of visual cues: alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic (neutral) beverages, negative images, and a fixation cross. Stimuli are presented in six 120-s epochs (total scan duration: 12 minutes), with each epoch consisting of four 24-s blocks (one block of alcohol cues, one block of neutral cues, one block of negative images, and one block of fixation). During each 24-s block, 5 individual pi[INVESTIGATOR_49546] ~4.8 seconds each. Alcohol blocks will be specific to beverage type (beer, wine, or liquor), with two blocks of each beverage type. Each block will be followed by a 6-s washout period, which allows the hemodynamic response from the previous block to decline. Prior to scanning, participants will be shown how to provide ratings of their cravings using an optically isolated universal serial bus (USB) interface, which consists of a four-button (1= low to 4= high) response box. Subjects will provide ratings of their craving immediately following each cue block.  5.5.

Description of Assessments  6.2.1. Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  The study physician and/or nurse practitioner are responsible for the detection, documentation, classification, reporting, and follow up of events meeting the definition of an AE or SAE.  Adverse Events will be assessed at the experimental visit.  However, SAEs will be collected from the time of informed consent onward. General symptoms will be collected via an open-ended question: “How have you been feeling since your last visit or the last time we spoke?”  Adverse Events will be recorded on the AE Log using accepted medical terms and/or the diagnoses that accurately characterize the event. When a diagnosis is known, the AE term recorded on the eCRF will be the diagnosis rather than a constellation of symptoms. The MD or NP will assess all AEs for seriousness, relationship to study medication, and severity. When an event has not resolved by [CONTACT_138114], it will be documented on the AE Log as “ongoing”.  If a woman has a positive or borderline pregnancy test after enrollment, the pregnancy will be recorded as an AE. The site will contact [CONTACT_3970]’s status until the pregnancy has been terminated or completed. The outcome of the pregnancy (e.g., normal birth, death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn) will be recorded.  All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed by [CONTACT_683817] (the event either resolved or stabilized and is not expected to resolve in the near term).  All SAE’s will be reported per requirements.   [IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE) Definition 
Endotoxin Study Protocol V13, April 2023 PI: [INVESTIGATOR_683789], PhD   
[ADDRESS_926070] a causal relationship with the administered treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant laboratory abnormality), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the medication. Pre-existing conditions, diseases, or disorders are not considered AEs unless there is a change in severity or frequency.  [IP_ADDRESS].1. Classification of Adverse Event Intensity and Relationship to Study Medication  For each recorded AE or SAE, the MD or NP must make an assessment of severity based on the following criteria:  • Mild: An event that is usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and does not generally interfere with the subject’s daily activities. • Moderate: An event that interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. The event is usually ameliorated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. • Severe: An event that interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects clinical status. The event poses a significant risk of harm to the subject and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481911], and typi[INVESTIGATOR_683794]. • Life-threatening: An event that puts the subject into imminent risk of death without intervention.  The MD or NP must also make an assessment of relationship to the investigational product based on the following criteria:  • Unrelated: The subject did not receive the investigational product, the temporal sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is not reasonable, or there is another obvious cause of the AE/SAE. • Unlikely: There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product but there is another more likely cause of the AE/SAE. • Possible: There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, but the AE/SAE could have been due to another equally likely cause. • Probable: There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, and the AE/SAE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_218913]. • Definite: There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, the AE/SAE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_218913], and the AE/SAE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the investigational product or investigational product class.  [IP_ADDRESS].2. Outcomes and Actions Taken  
Endotoxin Study Protocol V13, April 2023 PI: [INVESTIGATOR_683789], PhD   
15  All unresolved AEs will be followed for a minimum of 14 days (unless the AE is an ongoing pregnancy which must be followed to conclusion) after the subject’s final study visit, unless the investigator’s judgment dictates otherwise, the event has resolved or stabilized prior to the 14-day period, or the subject is lost to follow-up. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects that occur following the follow-up period.  For each recorded AE or SAE, the investigator must make an assessment of outcome at the time of last observation, as follows:  • Fatal: The subject died. • Resolved without Sequelae: The AE or SAE has ended. • Resolved with Sequelae: The AE or SAE has ended but changes are noted from baseline. • Unresolved – Ongoing: The AE has not ended and is ongoing at the end of the reporting period (i.e., 14 days after the final Follow-up visit) and the investigator deems that further follow up is not medically required • Unknown – Lost to Follow-up: Lost to follow-up after repeated unsuccessful attempts to contact [CONTACT_423].  Actions taken with respect to study medication (discontinuation or not) will also be recorded. In addition, if the AE was treated (medications or other physical measures), this will also be recorded.  [IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition  An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that meets one of the following:  • Results in death • Is life-threatening (at the time of the event) • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  A serious and unexpected AE is an SAE that is not identified in nature, intensity, or frequency in the risk information included in the Product Label for the drug. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the study subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  6.2.2.

Adverse events, including signs of sickness will be collected in an open-ended way at each in-person study visit.  Vital signs will be monitored at multiple time points during the experimental study visit. Alcohol withdrawal will be monitored at each visit through administration of the CIWA, and any significant withdrawal, as indicated by a score of 8+ on the CIWA will be reported to the study physician and/or nurse 
Endotoxin Study Protocol V13, April 2023 PI: [INVESTIGATOR_683789], PhD   
22  practitioner immediately.  In the event that significant medical problems are encountered, the study blind will be broken and appropriate medical treatment will be provided.   7.2. Internal Quality Assurance Monitoring  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_683797]. These monitoring visits provide the opportunity to evaluate the progress of the study and to obtain information about potential problems. The monitor will assure that data are accurate and in agreement with any paper source documentation used, verify that subjects’ consent for study participation has been properly obtained and documented, confirm that research subjects entered into the study meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, verify that study procedures are being conducted according to the protocol guidelines, monitor review AEs and SAEs, and assure that all essential documentation required by [CONTACT_20148] (GCP) guidelines are appropriately filed.  At the end of the study, they will confirm that the site has the appropriate essential documents on file, and advise on storage of study records.  7.3. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  An independent DSMB of external advisors will meet prior to the start of the study, annually during enrollment and follow-up and at trial end to review safety data. The Board will be blinded to subjects’ actual randomized group assignments but may request at any time that the blind be broken, if concerns arise from the blinded data. In addition to annual meetings, the DSMB will meet after half of the subjects (38) have been randomized to review safety data and the integrity of the study (i.e., an evaluation of the dropout rate and impact on the planned statistical analysis of the data) and make a formal recommendation to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_683798]. Ad hoc meetings will be convened if SAEs occur that are considered at least possibly related to the study procedures.  8. STATISTICAL METHODS AND POWER CONSIDERATIONS  To confirm the efficacy of random assignment and to check for group equivalence across demographics, drinking history, and other relevant baseline measures we will perform one-way ANOVAs or Kruskal-Wallis tests on continuous variables and chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests on categorical items. Descriptive statistics will be computed for continuous variables, and frequencies/proportions for categorical variables to summarize the data. Transformations of the continuous outcome variables will be performed as necessary (i.e. when data do not meet the assumptions of parametric statistical tests).  8.1. Statistical Power  A power analysis was conducted for the study based on results from a previous human endotoxin challenge carried out in a control sample by [CONTACT_93583] (Eisenberger et al., 2010). Effect size was calculated based on Eisenberger et al.’s reported sample size of N = 39 and F-statistic of 8.13 for increase in negative mood at T2 after endotoxin infusion, yielding Cohen’s d = 0.4687. Power analysis was conducted according to Cohen’s guidelines to determine the sample size needed to achieve a power ≥ 0.80 (i.e. 80%) at an alpha level of .05. Using the program G*Power version 3.1 and selecting the repeated measures ANOVA, within-between interactions design, where alpha = .05, effect size f = 0.234, we arrived at a total N = 76 completers (38 heavy drinkers and 38 healthy controls). Specifically, we powered the study 
Endotoxin Study Protocol V13, April 2023 PI: [INVESTIGATOR_683789], PhD   
[ADDRESS_926077] differences from baseline to peak (T2) inflammatory response, given that the remaining data points post-peak tend to be similar and may obscure the effects of the inflammatory challenge. Individuals who experience severe sickness symptoms will be excluded (expected to be <5% of the sample).  8.2. Aim 1: To test that low dose endotoxin will increase cue-induced craving for alcohol in heavy drinkers as compared to light drinking controls, and as compared to placebo.  Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) will be conducted using PROC GLM in SAS Statistical Software. Specifically, in the repeated measures ANOVA models, Group (Heavy drinking versus light drinking) will be a two level between-subjects factor, Treatment (endotoxin vs. placebo) will be a two level between-subjects factor, and Cue (water cues versus alcohol cues) will be a between-subjects factor. The dependent measure will be self-reported alcohol craving captured by [CONTACT_683829]. Sickness symptoms and drinking history (i.e., drinks per day and drinks per drinking day in past year) will be used as covariates in these analyses.  8.3. Aim 2: To test whether low dose endotoxin (0.8 ng/kg of body weight) will increase depressed mood as compared to placebo.  Repeated measures ANOVAs in which Group (Heavy drinking versus light drinking) will be a two level between-subjects factor, and Treatment (endotoxin vs. placebo) is a two level between-subjects factor. The outcome measure is depressed mood (captured by [CONTACT_683830]). Sickness symptoms and drinking history will also be included as covariates in these analyses.  8.4. Exploratory Analysis: To test associations between plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-a), depressed mood, and alcohol craving during the challenge; and examine sex differences in responses to the endotoxin challenge.  Repeated measures ANOVAs will be used to capture the effects of Treatment (endotoxin vs. placebo) by [CONTACT_91241] (T0 to T2) for the proposed planned outcomes (i.e. proinflammatory cytokines, hourly craving scores) as well as models that include sex as a between-subjects factor. As with the primary aims, sickness symptoms and drinking history will be entered in these models as covariates.   8.5. Exploratory Analysis: To test the effect of low dose endotoxin on neural alcohol cue-reactivity  fMRI Data Processing: FSL 6.0 (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) will be used for the neuroimaging analyses. Motion correction will be carried out using the Motion Correction Linear Image Registration Tool (McFLIRT, Version 5.0) with the estimated motion parameters entered as covariates in the general linear model. Brain Extraction Tool (BET) will be used for non-brain tissue/skull removal. The images will be smoothed using a FWHM Gaussian kernel (5 mm) and high-pass filtered (100s cutoff) in the temporal domain with the FMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT, Version 6.0). The EPI [INVESTIGATOR_683799], then to the MPRAGE using affine linear transformations, and into standard MNI space. Registration to standard space will be refined by [CONTACT_683831]’s FNIRT nonlinear registration.

24  fMRI Data Analysis: Explanatory variables for the alcohol cues task will be created by [CONTACT_683832] (alcohol, non-alcohol, blurred, and fixation cues; 24-s duration) with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function in FEAT. Temporal derivatives will be included as covariates. A 2X2 ANOVA in which Group (heavy drinker versus light drinker) will be a two level between-subjects factor and Treatment (endotoxin vs. placebo) is a two level between-subjects factor. The main contrast of interest will be activation during alcohol vs. non-alcohol blocks (ALC vs. BEV). Z-statistic images will be thresholded with cluster-based corrections for multiple comparisons based on the theory of Gaussian Random Fields with a cluster-forming threshold of Z>3.1 and a cluster-probability threshold of p<0.05. Sickness symptoms will also be included as covariates in these analyses.  8.6. Exploratory Analysis: To determine the effect of low dose on reward responsiveness  Repeated measures ANOVAs in which Group (Heavy drinking versus light drinking) will be a two level between-subjects factor, and Treatment (endotoxin vs. placebo) is a two level between-subjects factor. The outcome measure is reward responsiveness (captured by [CONTACT_683833]). Sickness symptoms and drinking history will also be included as covariates in these analyses.  9. ETHICS  9.1.

TITLE: An Open-Label Non-Randomized, Multi -Center Phase -2 Study of Convection -
Enhanced Delivery (CED) of MDNA55 in Adults with Recurrent or Progressive 
Glioblastoma  
RATIONALE:  MDNA55 is a fusion toxin comprising a genetically eng ineered circularly 
permuted interleukin -4 (cpIL-4) fused to a modified version of the Pseudomonas  
aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE). MDNA55 binds to the IL -4 receptor (IL4R), over -
expressed by [CONTACT_342717] -malignant immunosuppressive cells of the 
tumor micro-environment (TM E), and delivers a potent cell -killing agent, PE. A 
large percentage of glioblastomas (GBs) and their TME ex press IL4R in 
relatively high amounts, making it a relevant target for MDNA55 . Intra- and 
peritumoral infusion minimizes systemic exposure to the fu sion toxin, while the 
image-guided CED technique enhances exposure of active drug throughout the 
target region.  
MDNA55 shares many properties with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], suc h as immune 
checkpoint inhibitors, including the possibility of response following a prol onged 
(> 3 months) period of pseudo -progression. Given acknowledged difficulties in 
determination of true progression in patients treated with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the 
determination of progressive disease (PD) will be informed by [CONTACT_342718]/o r biopsy prior to subject withdrawal.   
STUDY 
OBJECTIVES:  Primary 
To assess overall survival (OS)  
Secondary 
To assess the effect of IL4 -R status on overall  survival (OS)  
To assess the safety of MDNA55 following CED  
To determine the objective response r ate (ORR) per Response Assessment in 
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) -based criteria  incorporating advanced imaging 
modalities. 
To assess progression -free survival (PFS)  
Exploratory 
To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MDNA55 in periph eral plasma  
To assess serum anti-MDNA55 antibody titers and, if elevated, determine 
neutralizing antibody titers  
To determine the relationship between clinical outco mes and response 
assessment status by [CONTACT_342719] -based response criteria  
To perform additional ad hoc efficacy and safety analyses as needed based on 
the data acquired in this study  
To assess the performance of the Brainlab catheter du ring infusion in terms of 
distribution and convection of the infusate using real time MRI monitoring 
KEY ENROLLMENT 
CRITERIA: In order to be eligible to participate in this study, male and  female subjects 
≥ [ADDRESS_424435] primary ( de novo) GB that has recurred or 
progressed (per standard RANO criteria), a life expectancy >  12 weeks and a 
Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 70. Subjects must have tumor diameter 
of ≥ 1 cm x ≥ 1 cm (minimum) to 4 cm in any direction by [CONTACT_094] -interventional 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) within [ADDRESS_424436] features which ma ke the tumor a poor target for CED ( e.g. significant 
liquefaction or geometric features not conducive to CED ). IL4-R status of tumor 
will be determined based on archived biopsy from the  time of initial diagnosis.

ANALYSIS 
POPULATIONS:  Subject Populations  
Following quality review of study images mid -way through recruitment, local 
tissue reactions, inflammation, immune cell infiltration, edema and/or necrosis, 
subsequent to MDNA55 administration, was observed in some subjects and has 
been seen to be indistinguishable from possible tumor growth using the imaging 
techniques adopted from the outset of this study. Therefore, obtaining reliable 
imaging data for the primary efficacy analysis has been s hown to be 
confounded. Consequently, under protocol version 6.0, the surrogate endpoint 
Objective Response Rate (ORR) will be assessed as a s econdary outcome 
measure with the median Overall Survival (mOS) becoming t he primary variable.   
Intent to Treat (mITT)  
An ITT population will comprise all subjects who receive an y amount of study 
drug will be used for the primary efficacy  analyses.  
A modified ITT population for secondary response analyses (mITT, see below) 
will comprise all subjects who receive any amount of  study drug and have 
adequate imaging or clinical data for the ORR analysis. 
NOTE: Patients who expi[INVESTIGATOR_342682].   
Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The PP population will comprise all subjects in the mITT population who also 
have no major protocol violations during the study. This population will be 
finalized prior to the final database lock and primary analysis of the study data. 
Efficacy analyses will be  conducted on this population in support of the primary 
efficacy results.

Version: v.6. 1    CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 10  [19JUL2019]  IL4R Analysis Population  
The IL4R analysis population will be the same as the  ITT Population, excluding 
patients who do not have archived tissue or adequate tissue available for 
analysis, and will be used for efficacy analyses  in subgroups according to  IL4R 
expression status .  
Safety Population  
The Safety population will comprise all subjects trea ted on study. Safety 
analyses will be presented on this population.  
Analyses 
The primary efficacy analysis of OS will be assessed according to a single -arm, 
single-stage design on the ITT population. OS will be determined via Kaplan -
Meier estimation, with medians, quartiles, and 95% conf idence intervals (CIs) 
reported. mOS wi ll tested using a single sample one sided log -rank test on a 
10% significance level against historical control  with null hypothesis of mOS of 
8 months and alternative hypothesis of OS > [ADDRESS_424437] 46 evaluable ITT subjects there will be  over 80% power for the 
primary analysis. 
A secondary analysis of the primary variable will be conducted in the IL4 -R 
population according to IL4 -R status.  
Details of the planned analyses and methods will be published in the SAP 
(statistical analysis plan) prior to database lock.  
PFS will be determined via Kaplan -Meier estimation, with medians, quartiles, 
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reported. mPFS will be tested with a single 
sample one sided log-rank test on a 10% significance level against historica l 
control with null hypothesis of  mPFS 4 months and alternative hypothesis of OS 
> 4 months.  
Descriptive analysis of the OS and PFS at 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment 
will be based on the raw proportions of subjects surv iving (and progression -free) 
at those time points as well as Kaplan -Meier estimation. Further analyses will 
also be conducted by [CONTACT_8668]4R stratum, including examination of the treatment effect 
by [CONTACT_8668]4R level.  
Efficacy analyses may also explore subject subsets ( e.g. IL4R level, tumor size,  
KPS, gender, age, steroid use,) and response by [CONTACT_342720].  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for subject d emographics and disposition, 
safety, and exposure data and will include the number of observations, mean, 
standard deviation, med ian, and range for continuous variables and number and 
percent for categorical variables; 95% CIs will be presented where appropriate.

Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 17  [19JUL2019]  1 Introduction  
The study drug, MDNA55, is a fusion protein consisting of a targeting domain linked to a pro -
apoptotic cell -killing payload. It was discovered and developed by [CONTACT_6283]. Raj Puri ([LOCATION_002] 
[US] Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) and Ira Pastan (National  Cancer Institute “NCI”) and 
has been described by [CONTACT_342722] 50 publications. It is a therapeutic agent that 
selectively targets cancer cells that over -express the interleukin -4 receptor (IL4R).  
The targeting domain is an engineered circul arly permuted version of interleukin -4 (cpIL-4) which 
is genetically fused to potent payload comprised of a tru ncated version of the bacterial toxin, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  exotoxin (PE) A ( Kreitman et al., 1994). It was developed for the 
treatment of glioblastoma ( GB) and other adult and pediatric central nervous system (CNS)  
cancers including immunosuppressive cells of the glioblastoma tumor m icroenvironment (TME) 
that frequently over -express the IL-4 receptor (IL4R ; Puri et al., 1994; Kohanbash et al., 2013).  
The mechanism of action of MDNA55 is well documented ( Kreitman et al., 1994; Rand et al., 
2000; Puri et al., 2009) and is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1. MDNA55 binds to IL4R  overexpressed on the 
surface of tumor cells and the entire complex is endocytosed. Following cleavage and activation 
by [CONTACT_342723]-like proteases found in high concentrations in the endoso me of cancer cells, the catalytic 
domain of the truncated PE is released  into the cytosol where it induces cell death via adenosine 
diphosphate (ADP )-ribosylation of the Elongation Factor -2 and induction of apoptosis through 
caspase activation  (Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_342684], 2010 ). 
Figure 1: Schematic of MDNA55 Mechanism of Action 
 
 

Protocol # MDNA55 -05 
Version: v.6. 1    CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 18  [19JUL2019]  Many features of MDNA55 make it a rational choice for the treatment of  GB and other primary 
and metastatic tumors in the CNS: 
1. The majority of cancer biopsy and autopsy samples fr om adult and pediatric CNS tumors, 
including recurrent GB biopsies , have been shown to over -express the IL4R with little or 
no IL4R expression in normal adult and pediatric brain tissue ( Puri et al., 1996; Kawakami 
et al., 2002; Joshi, et al., 2001; Konanbash et al., 2013). Cells that do not express the 
IL4R target do not bind to MDNA55 and are , therefore, not subject to PE -mediated effects 
(Kawakami et al., 2002; Puri et al., 2005).  
2. Unlike chemotherapeutic agents and rad iation, MDNA55’s cell -killing ability is not growth -
rate dependent ( Li and Hall, 2010). Due to its mechanism of action, quiescent cancer stem 
cells and slower growing non -malignant cells of the TME may be as sensitive to MDNA 55 
as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_46548].  
3. O6-methylguanine -methyltransferase (MGMT)  positive cancer cells (harboring 
unmethylated MGMT promoters and therefore resistant to temozolomide) are sensitive to 
MDNA55. CNS and non-CNS cancer cell lines such as T98G (g lioblastoma), HT -29 (colon 
cancer), and Mia-Paca-2 (pancreatic cancer) are known to over -express MGMT and are 
resistant to alkylating agents such as temozolomide ( Huang et al., 2012; Kuo et al., 2007; 
Kokkinakis et al., 2003). However, these IL4R -expressing cell lines show pi[INVESTIGATOR_342685]55  (Puri et al., 1996; Kreitman et al., 1995; Shimamura et al., 2007), 
indicating that MDNA55 could provide a treatment option for MGMT positive GB patients .  
4. Furin-like proteases are required for cleavage of MDNA55 and activation of the PE toxin 
(Chironi et al., 1997; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_342684], 2010 ). High expression levels of furin in targeted 
glioma cells as opposed to normal cells ( Mercapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328], et al., 2002; Wick et al., 2004) 
provides additional tumor specificity and is also a contributory factor to the exceptional 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_342686]55.  
5. The pro-apoptotic domain of MDNA55 ( i.e., PE) is far more potent tha n chemotherapeutic 
agents (Li and Hall, 2010 ). It kills cancer cells by [CONTACT_342724] ( Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_342687], 2010 ), a mechanism not employed by [CONTACT_342725] -cancer agents.  
6. Internalization of MDNA55 into the target cell occurs via a mechanism that is independent 
of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), a membrane associated protein that is commonly used to 
transport chemotherapeutic drugs. Mutations in P-gp often lead to cancer cells becoming 
resistant to traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, a problem not ex pected with MDNA55 
Protocol # MDNA55 -05 
Version: v.6. 1    CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 19  [19JUL2019]  since it does not rely on P -gp for entry into the cell ( Strome et al., 2002; de Jong et al., 
2003).  
7. GB has a robust immunosuppressive TME and may compris e up to 40% of the tumor 
mass (Kennedy et al., 2013). Recently, it has been shown that malignant gliomas  have a 
T-helper cell type -2 (Th2) bias and are heavily infiltrated by [CONTACT_342726] (MDSCs) and tumor associated macrophages  (TAMs) and that the IL4/IL4R bias 
mediates their immunosuppressive functions  (Harshyne, et al., 2016). Furthermore, IL4R  
is up-regulated on glioma -infiltrating myeloid cells but not in the periphery or  in normal 
brain (Kohanbash et al., 2013). Thus, purging Th2 cells, MDSCs, and TAMs using 
MDNA55 may all eviate the immune block associated with cancer (in a manner similar to 
immunomodulators such as ipi[INVESTIGATOR_226139] , pembrolizumab or nivolumab), thereby [CONTACT_342727]-tumor immunity and aid in long -term disease control.  
Safety of MDNA55 has been adequately characterized in non-clinical studies. In addition, safety 
and efficacy of MDNA55, administered as a single dose by [CONTACT_342728]- and peritumoral infusion 
via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) h as been evaluated in a total of 72 adults with high grade 
recurrent gliomas (including 66 adults with recurrent GB) in thre e prior clinical studies. All 
nonclinical and clinical studies conducted to date are summarized in the  current Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
Although not designed for efficacy, the Phas e 1/[ADDRESS_424445] of tumor response on survival outcomes. 
Analysis of efficacy is provided in the  current Investigator’s Brochure.  
Results from prior studies show promising anti -tumor effects when MDNA55 is administered via 
CED. Thus, by [CONTACT_342729], a multi -center, single -arm, open-label 
study will be carrie d out in approximately 52 (at least 46 evaluable) patients with GB at recurrence 
or progression who will receive MDNA55  via intra- and peritumoral infusion  using CED. The 
efficacy of MDNA55 will be investigated with subjects having tumor diameter of ≥ 1 cm x ≥ 1 cm 
(minimum) to  4 cm in any direction, no more than 2 relapses, and a Karnofsky s core of ≥ [ADDRESS_424446] diagnosis of GB will be conducted to determine the role of the IL4R biomarker on 
treatment response and patient outcomes. In addition, the IL4R bi omarker and other

biopsy samples are available.  
Planning software will be utilized to optimize catheter placement ( Rosenbluth et al., 2012) and 
small diameter catheters with a stepped design will be used to significantly reduce reflux along 
the catheter tract  (Jahangiri et al., 2016; Krauze et al., 2005b) in order to im prove distribution of 
MDNA55. Furthermore, co -infusion of a surrogate tracer ( gadolinium-diethylenetriamine 
pentaacetic acid [ Magnevist®] [Gd-DTPA]) during CED  will enable effective real -time monitoring 
of drug distribution thereby [CONTACT_342730]55 ( Chittiboina et al., 2014; Jahangiri et al., 2016).  Use of the latest 
CED technologies and real-time imaging has the potential to improve MDNA55 distribution, its 
safety as well as patient outcomes .  
1.[ADDRESS_424447] -line treatment for primary GB includes surgical resection o f the bulk tumor to the 
maximal extent possible consistent with neurological preservation, followed by [CONTACT_114658], often 
in combination with temozolomide ( Stupp protocol; Stupp et al., 2005). When relapse or 
progression occurs in patients who have undergone the Stupp protocol , therapeutic options are 
unfortunately  limited and generally not effective.  
Surgery may be indicated in a minority of relapsed patients with disease that is symptomatic from 
mass effect, but it results in only limited prolongat ion of survival ( Keles et al., 2004). Survival may 
be improved by [CONTACT_342731] ® (carmustine) implant. However, the majority 
of patients with relapsed disease are not candidates for additional surgery ( Weller et al., 2013). 
The use of Gliadel is thereby [CONTACT_342732].  
Avastin® (bevacizumab)  has been seen to improve 6-month progression free survival (PFS) to 
42.6% and increase in median overall survival to 9.3 months in patients with recurrent GB . 
Genentech received accelerated approval from the US  FDA for Avastin , in patients with 
recurrent GB patients who had failed first -line chemotherapy, based on an overall response rate 
of 28% (Friedman et al., 2009).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_342688], t here is an urgent need for more effective targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_342689]. Intra - and peritumoral infusion via CED of targeted fusion toxin, such 
as MDNA55, is a promis ing novel tumor -specific therapeutic for the treatment of this disease.  
Protocol # MDNA55 -05 
Version: v.6. 1    CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 21  [19JUL2019]  1.[ADDRESS_424448] of highly potent 
bacterial or plant toxin moieties (payloads) fused to tumor -specific ligands (targeting domains). 
They represent a novel anti -cancer modality that may offer  several advantages over conventional 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. One such novel fusion toxin in development is MDNA55. Fusion toxins such as 
MDNA55 take advantage of the selective expression of  receptors (e.g., IL4R) on tumor cells, 
cancer stem cells (CSCs) and tumor micr oenvironment (TME) (safety and tolerability) with the 
effectiveness of potent toxins (anti -tumor efficacy). The function of the targeting domain of 
MDNA55 (i.e., IL-4) is “to guide” the toxin specifically to the tumor cells while sparing normal cells. 
Fusion toxins such as MDNA55, directed at tumor specific targets therefore, exhibit a relatively 
wide therapeutic index when compared to conventional chemotherapeutic agents.  
MDNA55 has the following unique characteristics:  
• Induces tumor shrinkage independent of growth rate. Quiescent CSCs, slow growin g cells 
of the TME and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_342690] 
(Hall et al., 1992) 
• Uses a multi -pronged approach to cancer therapy. MDN A55 is able to simultaneously 
target bulk tumor, deplete CSCs ( Merchant et al., 2015) and may also purge  TAMs and 
MDSCs, key components of the TME ( Bankaitis and Fingleton, 2015 ) 
New understandi ng of the role played by [CONTACT_342733]. With a multi -pronged approach, 
MDNA55 may therefore provide an overall m eaningful and durable long -term response in CNS 
tumors that over -express the IL4R.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_424449] been known to frequently over -express the IL4R and  available data 
demonstrate that a large percentage of GBs express the IL4R at relatively high levels  (Puri et al., 
1994; Puri et al., 1996; Joshi et al., 2001; Joshi et al., 2002). Detailed information on IL4R  as a 
drug target for GB including recent studies evaluating IL4R expression in matched biopsy samples 
of newly diagnosed and  recurrent GB obtai ned from the same patient are provided  in the current 
Protocol # MDNA55 -05 
Version: v.6. 1    CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 22  [19JUL2019]  Investigator’s Brochure. These data indicate that GB patients continue to expr ess the IL4R at 
recurrence and in some cases, at much higher levels.  
1.2.3 Convection Enhanced Delivery 
MDNA55 is a large fusion protein (53 kDa) and as suc h is not able to cross the blood brain barrier 
(BBB). In order to by -pass the BBB, localized delivery techniques such as convection enhanced 
delivery (CED) are being widely developed for CNS diseases. CED improves drug delivery to 
brain tumors intraparenchymal ly by [CONTACT_342734], or fluid convection, established as a result 
of a pressure gradient, rather than a concentration gradient ( Yin et al., 2011). As such, CED offers 
markedly improved  distribution of infused therapeutics within the CNS compared to direct injection 
or via drug eluting polymers, both of which depend on diffusion  for parenchymal distribution. 
Additionally, CED obviates the challenges of systemic a gents crossing the BBB  while minimizing 
systemic exposure and toxicity. ( Fiandaca et al., 2008; Yin et al., 2011; Vogelbaum and Aghi, 
2015). Advantages of CED over diffusion -based delivery include:  
• Expanded volume of distribution (Vd); volume of distr ibution being greater than the volume 
of infusion (Vi);  
• Uniform concentration of the infused therapeutic with in the target volume ;  
• Delivery of the vast majority of the infused therape utic within the target volume.  
CED distribution is enhanced by [CONTACT_342735] s within the brain’s perivascular spaces 
(Hadaczek et al., 2006). Additionally, better understanding of the complexities of the extracellular 
matrix and its effects on convection has led to improved  distribution (Hamilton et al., 2001; Neeves 
et al., 2007; Nguyen et al., 2001). For example, technical CED inf usion parameters, such as 
cannula size and shape, infusion rate , infusate concentration, and tissue sealing time, have been 
defined and refined to improve distribution of study agents while limiting potential toxicities and 
morbidities (Morrison et al., 1999; Chen et al., 1999; Wein et al., 2002; Krauze et al., 2005b; Healy 
and Vogelbaum, 2015 ; Lewis et al., 2016). 
1.2.4 Real-time Imaging of Convective Delivery  
A major advance in the safe and potentially efficaci ous use of CED in neurosurgery has been the 
development of real-time imaging of convective delivery (RCD), which utilizes magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize the CED process with th e aid of co-convected contrast 
agent (Krauze et al., 2005a; Fiandaca et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2003; Krauze et al., 2005b; 
Murad et al., 2006; Lonser et al., 2007; Chittiboina, et al., 2014; Lonser, et al., 2015). Use of RCD 
Protocol # MDNA55 -05 
Version: v.6. 1    CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 23  [19JUL2019]  allows physicians to directly monitor distribution of therapeutics within the brain. Thus, reflux along 
the CED catheter or leaka ge outside the target area, especially at higher flow rates, can be 
monitored and corrective  steps taken, such as retargeting the catheter or altering the rate of 
infusion (Fiandaca et al., 2008; Varenika et al., 2008).  
The RCD technique will be used in this study and represe nts an important advancement in drug 
delivery and distribution in the brain. Earlier clinical trials that did not utilize RCD did not achieve 
adequate distribution of the study drug,  which may have caused the studies to not meet their 
clinical endpoints  (Gill et al., 2003; Marks et al., 2010; Sampson et al., 2010). Use of RCD in this 
trial will enable direct visualization of the study drug dis tribution, permit uniform tumor coverage 
and enhanced contact [CONTACT_342736] (GB and TME) and MDNA55.  
In many studies using RCD, the surrogate tracer of choice has been gadolinium. Gd -DTPA 
(Magnevist®) is a contrast agent manufactured by [CONTACT_342737] , Inc., and 
has been used clinically for many years .  
Prior in vitro and in vivo studies (Mardor, et al., 2009; Ding et al., 2010) have shown that Gd -
DTPA is biocompatible and safe when co-administered with the MDNA55 (see current 
Investigator’s Brochure).  Gd-DTPA, in combination with fusion toxins, has also been safely 
administered intracerebrally to patients in multiple clinical studies  using CED (Lonser et al., 2007; 
Weber et al., 2003a; Weber et al., 2003b; Sampson, et al., 2011; Chittiboina, et al., 2014). 
Although gadolinium -based contrast agents are not approved for intracerebral administration , 
these studies support that Gd-DTPA can be safely administered via CED infusion in combination 
with locally administered therapeutics, such as MDNA55 .  
In 2017 the EMA  (EMA/457616/2017 ) and FDA (FDA Drug Safety Communication [5 -22-2017]) 
both conducted reviews of gadolinium safety following some evidence of low levels of gadolinium 
deposition in brain tissues following intravenous administration in animals. No evidence of harm 
to humans has been  described, nevertheless minimizing gadolinium exposure is recommende d 
as a precautionary measure . 
1.3 Experience with the Investigational Drug (MDNA55)  
1.3.1 Nonclinical Experience with MDNA55 
All non-clinical studies of MDNA55 alone or in combination with Gd -DTPA are summarized in the

All prior clinical studies conducted with MDNA55 are summarized in the  current Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
Multiple doses of MDNA55 have been  intratumorally administered to study subjects  in an 
investigator initiated study; Rand et al., 2000) where 9 subjects with histologically confirmed 
recurrent GB were infused with MDNA55. MDNA55 concentration and infusion volumes ranged 
from 0.2 to 6.0 µg/mL and [ADDRESS_424451] the hypothesis that mOS is improved to a clinically significant extent 
with MDNA55 administered via CED, as compared to current a vailable treatments for 
recurrent/progressive GB. The assumptions regarding response to current treatment are based 
on aggregated mOS  data from previou s clinical trials in patients with recurrent/progressive 
glioblastoma weighted according to consistency with the subject in clusion criteria in this trial . The 
current design is based on a null hypothesis that mOS is 8.[ADDRESS_424452] -
treatment imaging and the possibility of response following prolonged (> 3 months) pseudo -
progression (Weber et al., 2003a; 2003b ; Okada et al., 2015), both of which can confound the 
assessment of ORR  (Ellingson et al., 2017b) . The mode of action of MDNA55 includes initial 
inflammatory response  and necrosis  in areas of macroscopic and microscopic infiltrative tumor 
whereby [CONTACT_342738]ﬂammatory responses mimic radiological features of tumor  progression with 
increased enhancement and edema (Weber et al., 2003a; 2003b ). 
Protocol # MDNA55 -05 
Version: v.6. 1    CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 25  [19JUL2019]  Pseudo-progression is an increase in contrast enhancement on MRI without true underlying tumor 
progression and may be due to tumor necrosis associated with MDNA55’s known mechanism or 
local tissue reaction due to the CED  procedure. Subjects with pseudo -progression may develop 
brain edema, mass effect and other symptoms  that are clinically indistinct from typi[INVESTIGATOR_342691]. Failure to recognize this phenomenon may result in p remature subject withdrawals 
from the study, prior to  establishing evidence of clinical benefit . To minimize these confounding 
effects, the application of the RANO criteria in this study will include the use of multi -modality 
imaging assessments for response analysis and allowing of the designation of non -progression 
status to patients who have no subsequent signs of disease progression on imaging after initially 
being considered to have progressive disease  (PD). Multi-modality assessments include contrast -
enhanced MRI, diffusion MRI , perfusion MRI, spectroscopic MRI, TRAMs, clinical evaluatio n and 
tumor tissue biopsy to aid identification of pseudo -progression during  early progressive 
enhancement  on T1 images with contrast.  Furthermore, in determining PD, there will be less 
weight on T2-FLAIR images associated with edema. Worsening of clinic al symptoms attributed 
to edema or increased use of steroids to control edema will not automatically be registered as 
PD. 
For the same reason , sites will be strongly recommended that subjects remai n in the study for at 
least [ADDRESS_424453] treatment  unless unequivocal evidence of confirmed disease progression is 
agreed.

ventricular catheters used in previous GB studies ( Krauze et al., 2005b; Rosenbluth et al., 2011; 
White et al., 2011; Gill et al., 2013; Jahangiri et al., 2016). This has allowed for improved flow 
rates (see Section 1.4.5). 
In the US, there are essentially 2 step design catheter options  and both are being and/or have 
been used in CED studies; the Brainlab Flexible Catheter [510(k) K12 3605] and the MRI 
Interventions SmartFlow® Cannula [510(k) K102101]. The Brainlab  catheter is an MRI -
compatible flexible catheter that has a rigid stylet design for accurate positioning. This cathe ter 
can be left in-place post-surgery and will therefore be employed in this study as it allows continued 
post-surgical infusion . On the other hand, the SmartFlow® cannula is rigid and can  only be used

Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 28  [19JUL2019]  intra-operatively. Like the Brainlab catheter, it is a lso MRI compatible , has an identical tip design  
and is amenable for accurate placement.  Both catheters are intended for single use only and not 
intended for implantation. MDNA55 infusate (prepared in Elliotts B® solution  together with 0.02% 
HSA and 7mM of Gd-DTPA) has been tested and shown to be bio -compatible with the Brainlab 
catheter and other tubing components comprising the infusion assembly  and will therefore be 
used in this study.  
1.4.4 Rationale for Infusion Planning / Catheter Placement Planning  
The efficiency of CED in distributing a drug into a tumor depends on correct placement of 
catheters within the tumor, catheter diameter, flow rate, infusate characteristics, and tissue 
consistency of the treated area ( Wein et al., 2002; Sampson et al., 2007; Jahangiri et al., 2016). 
An incorrectly placed catheter can lead to the in fused drug exiting the tumor through sulci or taking 
a path of least resistance into the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF), resulting in limited drug exposure of  
the tumor, and lack of efficacy and potential toxicity.  
To ensure optimal placement  for maximal tumor coverage, Brainlab iPlan® Flow software wil l be 
used as the primary tool for  generating a pre -treatment plan for placement of catheters ( Sampson 
et al., 2007) prior to infusion. Using MRI of the tumor obtai ned prior to infusion, the software will 
be used to predict the optimal trajectory for placement of each catheter, making sure to avoid 
fissures, sulci, and other elements that can contribute to inade quate distribution. iPlan® software 
helps to predict the  placement of the catheter tip according to the catheter placement guidelines 
(see Section 6.3), to  optimize convection of the infusate as well as assist in ensuring safe 
placement of catheter s by [CONTACT_342739], etc.  
For this study , the iPlan®Flow software and MRI imaging  will be employed for pre-treatment 
catheter trajectory planning . Pre-treatment catheter trajectory planning will be performed with aim 
to place up to 4 catheters but a minimum of 2, depending up on the tumor size. Planning for 
catheter placement will only target the enhancing region of the tumor on MRI.  MRI perfusion 
imaging and other advanced imaging modalities may be used to inform on optimal placement of 
the catheter tip s in the active tumor and to support trajectory planning to avoid significant 
vasculature.  
All investigational sites selected for this study ha ve prior CED experience; nevertheless , all sites 
will be thoroughly trained in the correct use of the  catheter, infusion  planning, catheter placement 
and CED infusion with peer -to-peer support of early cases to ensure consistency across study 
sites.

Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 29  [19JUL2019]  1.4.[ADDRESS_424455] on the efficiency of CED. In 
previous clinical studies with MDNA55 , the infusion flow rate of 10  µL/min/catheter was evaluated 
(using large diameter ventricular catheters that were not designed for C ED) to administer large 
volumes of infusate over several days.  
As discussed above ( Section 1.4.3) smaller diameter catheters designed specifically  for CED of 
therapeutics into the br ain tumor have been developed, which permit higher flow rates with 
minimal back flow due to their step design  Krauze et al. (2005b) and Richardson et al. (2011) as 
well as recent studies at UCSF (Butowski et al., 2015), showed that 50  µL/min is a safe flow rate 
without reflux and affords better manipulation of the dynamics of infusion, allowing for better tumor 
coverage, especially with larger volumes. Further , Butowski et al. (2015) reported that for efficient 
CED in brain tumors, the maximum volume of drug should be infused in the shorte st possible 
time. In this study, flow rates will be individualized as use  of real-time MRI infusion monitoring will 
enable the Investigator to determine the optimal flow rate of infusate for each subject .  
Although the MDNA55 infusate has shown to be bio -compatible with the Brainlab catheters at 
flow rates of up to 50 µL/min, optimal flow  rate for effective intra - and peritumoral distribution of 
MDNA55 in vivo via the Brainlab flexible catheter is not established and may vary from patient to 
patient due to tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, the rate of infusion will be conse rvatively assessed 
with flow rate initiated at 3 µL/min/catheter and gra dually increased in a stepwise manner to a 
maximum of 10 µL/min/catheter  (see Section 6.3). The infusion flow rate can be adjusted at the 
discretion of the Investigator during  the real time monitoring period to check leakage, reflux  and 
functioning of all implanted catheters  (with subject maintained under anesthesia) . The flow rate 
should be established such that the duration of infusion is at least [ADDRESS_424456] awake. MRI will be performed upon completion of infusion as a  final evaluation of 
MDNA55 infusate distribution.  
The rate of infusion may be reduced by 50% or the in fusion stopped and restarted at the discretion 
of the Investigator if the subject shows signs of intolerance. Section [IP_ADDRESS] provides information 
relating to interruption or discontinuation of infusion.  Reduction to the maximum permitted rate of 
administration to see drug delivery sustained for up to 48 hours  may be considered, guided by

1.4.6 Rationale for Real-Time Imaging of Infusate Distribution  
NeoPharm conducted a study  from 2004 to 2006 using an IL -13-PE fusion protein  (cintredekin 
besudotox, CB), to target the IL -[ADDRESS_424457] recurrence in which CED was 
used to locally administer CB following surgical resection of the  tumor. The study drug did not 
show survival advantage when compared to Gliadel ( Kunwar et al., 2010).  
Several reasons have been proposed to explain the la ck of efficacy of CB ( Chandramohan et al., 
2012; Jarboe et al., 2007; Sampson et al., 2010). 
• The trial did not include real -time imaging to ascertain if the required amount of drug was 
delivered to the tumor site ( Sampson et al., 2010).  
• The estimated coverage of relevant target volu mes was low, so that only 20.1% of the 
penumbra surrounding the resection cavity was covered ( Chandramohan et al., 2012).  
• Post-trial analysis on catheter positioning revealed only 49.8% of catheters met all 
positioning crite ria (Chandramohan et al., 2012).  
Thus, even where IL -13Ralpha2 was present in the  tumor (Jarboe et al., 2007), delivery of the 
drug to the tumor target was suboptimal. These results highlight t he need for real -time imaging to 
assess catheter placement and drug distribution.  
The objective in this study will be to achieve maximal coverage of the tumor and peritumoral 
margin. Therefore, real -time imaging of drug distribution, through co -infusion of a tracer will be 
employed as a means of assessing infusate distribution.   
Preclinical studies using  MDNA55 were carried out to evaluate the effect of the imagi ng agent 
Gd-DTPA in combination with various concentrations of MDNA55 ( Ding et al., 2010) and human 
serum albumin (HSA) administered  by [CONTACT_342741]. Results showed that 
the addition of Gd -DTPA (7 µmol/mL) was well tolerated and that Gd -DTPA did not affect the 
potency of MDNA55.  Feasibility of safely co-infusing Gd-DTPA as a surrogate tracer has been 
demonstrated in a number of clinical studies ( Chittiboina et al., 2014; Lonser et al., 2007; 
Souweidane 2014 ; Weber et al., 2003a; Weber et al., 2003b). Therefore, in this study, co -infusion 
of Gd-DTPA (commercially available Magnevist®) will allow for depi[INVESTIGATOR_342692]. Notably, co -infusion of Gd -DTPA will enable 
Protocol # MDNA55 -05

Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 31  [19JUL2019]  continuous real -time monitoring of  MDNA55 distribution and permit real -time adjustment of 
infusate delivery by [CONTACT_342742] a non -convecting catheter, repositioning the catheter or 
adjusting the infusate flow rate).   
Under protocol versions 1.0, 2.[ADDRESS_424458] study (Phase 1) resection was only performe d in response to uncontrolled 
edema. In the second study ( Phase 2), the objective was to resect the tumor three weeks post -
infusion irrespective of the edema response.  
Tumor resection post -treatment neither affected disease outcome nor improved patient s urvival 
(see current Investigator’s Brochure for more detail). Histological examination o f resected tumors 
showed that by [CONTACT_342743] [ADDRESS_424459] of intra - and peritumoral administration of

following: 
• Confirmed disease progression ; before withdrawing a subject for disease progression, 
Investigators are encouraged to : 
o Ensure confirmatory imaging is obtained following a suitable interval once 
radiological disease progression is suspected  (i.e. PD is not confirmed if a 
subsequent scan shows disease control)  
o Use all available  diagnostic imaging modalities (e.g. perfusion MRI, PET scan,

5 Study Drug 
5.1 Investigational Agent: MDNA55  
Classification  
MDNA55 (IL -4[38-37]-PE38KDEL) is a recombinant fusion toxin, of approximatel y 53 kDa, 
consisting of an engineered  circularly permuted (cp) version of interleukin -4 (cpIL-4) which is 
genetically fused to potent payload comprised of a truncated version of the bacterial toxin, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  exotoxin (PE) A ( Kreitman et al., 1994).  
Mechanism of Action  
The mechanism of action of MDNA55 is well documented ( Rand et al., 2000; Kreitman et al., 
1994, Puri et al., 2009) and is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1. MDNA55 binds to IL4R overexpressed on the 
surface of tumor cells and the entire complex is endocytosed. Following cleavage and activation 
by [CONTACT_342723]-like proteases f ound in high concentrations in the endosome of cancer cells, the catalytic 
domain of the truncated PE is released into the cytosol where it induces cell death via ADP-
ribosylation of the Elongation Factor -2 and induction of apoptosis through caspase activa tion 
(Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_342684], 2010 ). 
MDNA55 is produced by a fed batch fermentation proces s using recombinant Escherichia coli . It 
is expressed intra cellularly in the form of inclusion bodies. Following cell lysis and solubilizat ion 
of the inclusion bodies, crude protein is purified using multiple chromatographic purification steps.

Storage and Handling  
Vials will be stored at -70°C (± 10°C); MDNA55 is known to be stable for at least [ADDRESS_424481] will be diluted in Elliotts B ® Solution to produce an infusate with a final 
concentration adjusted to ensure the delivery  of a total dose of  MDNA55 of up to 240 µg based 
on tumor size , with  HSA and  Gd-DTPA (commercially available Magnevist®; 469.1 
mg/mL;  D etails on the preparation of MDNA55 infusate are provided in  the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
Side Effects 
Complete and updated AE information i s available in the current version of the Investigator’s  
Brochure. 
6 TREATMENT PLAN  
MDNA55 will be administered at a fixed concentration.  For patients treated under protocol version 
5.0, this will be 6.0 µg/mL, unless advised otherwise by [CONTACT_456]’s medical representative on 
behalf of the SRC (see section 5.1) and detailed in an updated pharmacy manual. The study is 
designed to utilize a volume of infusion (Vi) to achieve maximal coverage of the tumor and 
peritumoral margin.  Use of a surrogate tracer (Gd -DTPA) during infusion of MDNA55 will aim to 
monitor the pattern of coverage of the tumor and peritumoral margin and estimate the volume of 
distribution (Vd).

 The total dose will not exceed 240 µg (the establish ed MTD).  
The study is designed to utilize a volume of infusio n (Vi) individualized for each subject based on 
tumor size in order to achieve maximal coverage of the tumor and peritumoral margin.  Use of a 
surrogate tracer (Gd -DTPA) during infusion of MDNA55 will aim to monitor  the pattern of coverage 
of the tumor and peritumoral margin and estimate the volume of distribution (Vd). The duration of 
infusion will be  at least 24 hours; however, infusion may continue to approximately  48 hours if 
required.   
In the event of any  concerns by [CONTACT_342753], 
reductions to the concentration, volume or rate of administration  may be advised via the Sponsor’s 
medical representative and detailed in an updated ph armacy manual.  Likewise, the SRC may 
permit usage of concentrations  up to 12 µg/mL (provided total dose does not exceed 240 µg 
(MTD) if ongoing data review suggests a positive bene fit-risk. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.2 Dose Administration  
Total volume of infusion (see section 6.1) will be administered via up to 4 catheter s surgically 
placed according to catheter placement guidelines (see Section 6.3).

Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 53 [19JUL2019]  Screening MRIs will be assessed for determination of d isease status , subject eligibility  and 
convectibility . These images will be evaluated at the site and transmitted  to the central reviewer  
to provide independent central assessment of objective tumor characteristics. All image reviews 
concerning study endpoints will be conducted in a blinded manner by [CONTACT_15034], 
without knowledge of the clinical condition or identi ty of the subject or the local site assessment. 
 
 
The following criteria will be utilized for independen t evaluation of objective tumor characteri stics 
for consideration in determination of eligibility as follows:  
• Tumor diameter of ≥ 1 cm x ≥ 1 cm (perpendicular dimensions), minimum, and a maximum 
size in any single dimension of  4 cm  
• Tumor location not infratentorial or involving brain stem 
• Exclude regions in the eloquent areas or close to eloquent areas of the brain. 
• Diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri (highly infiltrativ e T2 hyperintense tumor with ill -defined 
margins encompassing at least three lobes of the brai n) 
• Multifocal lesions and multicentric  lesions are discouraged, but allowable so long as all 
boundaries of any multifocal, measurable enhancing lesions are within a 4cm x 4cm area 
(maximum area covered by [CONTACT_342747]). Multifocal lesions are defined by >1 
measurable enhancing lesion (1cm x 1 cm perpendicular dimensions) separated by [CONTACT_2669] 
1cm with confluent T2 hyperintensity between the lesions. Multicentric lesions are defined 
by >1 measurable enhancing lesion (1cm x 1cm perpendicular dimensions) separated by 
[CONTACT_2669] 1cm with normal brain  between the lesions.  
Independent central review of screening MRIs will be expedi ted. No subject will be enrolled in the 
study without this central imaging assessment being performed and reviewed by [CONTACT_342757], as required, especially 
in regard to tumors considered not to be good candidat es for CED (see Section 4.2.2; exclusion

Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 54 [19JUL2019]  Follow up MRIs will be subject to local site review for lesion assessment including tumor 
measurements in order to ensure consistency in all lo cal tumor assessments (see Image 
Acquisition Guide).  
Follow up MRIs will also be subject to independent cent ral image review for determination of 
response/progression in cluding tumor volume and perfusion criteria at each follow up time point.  
7 Study Procedures  and Observations  
7.1 Efficacy Evaluation  
7.1.1 Survival 
After progression (on study or during follow -up), subjects will continue to be followed for survival 
and post-study treatment(s) for GB and imaging for GB, where possible, until death (or termination 
of data collection by [CONTACT_342744]).  
7.1.2 Tumor Response Assessment  
MDNA55 shares many properties with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], suc h as immune checkpoint inhibitors, 
including the possibility of response following a prolonged (>  3 months) period of pseudo -
progression. Given acknowledged difficulties in determination of true progression in patients 
treated with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the determ ination of progressive disease (PD) will be informed by 
[CONTACT_342758]/or biopsy prior to subject withdrawal.   
Tumor response  will be determined using RANO-based criteria (section 8.1.1) incorporating 
advanced imaging modalities .  
ORR, PFS, duration of response ( DOR), and duration of clinical benefit (DOCB) will be assessed 
based on the independent assessment.   
See section 8.1 for information on efficacy endpoints.  
7.2 Safety Evaluation  
Safety will be evaluated through AE monitoring, clinica l evaluations ( i.e., vital signs, physical 
examinations, electrocardiogram [ECG]), laboratory tests ( i.e., hematology, serum chemistries, 
and urinalysis), antibody (serum anti -MDNA55 antibody and neutralizing antibody where 
applicable) assessments, and plasma drug levels on PK samples from the signing of informed 
consent until the last study visit ([ADDRESS_424488] -CED infusion or termination).

their respective local certified laboratori es) at various time points for each subject (see Table 7). 
Required clinical laboratory tests for each panel wil l be as follows:  
• Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, and 
WBC differential;  
• Coagulation: prothrombi n time (PT)/PTT/INR (PTT, corrected, if necessary);   
• Serum chemistry: AST, ALT, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tot al bilirubin, indirect 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, sodium, potassium, chloride, 
carbon dioxide, calcium, phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid, 
and glucose;  
• Urinalysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, k etones, blood, leukocyte esterase, and 
nitrite. Microscopy required only to follow -up clinically significant abnormal findings; and  
• Pregnancy: Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at screening and at [ADDRESS_424490] CED infusion for all women of childbearing potential.  
The Investigator or a designated associate will revie w all clinical laboratory results, and clinically 
significant findings will be reported as AEs (see Section 8.2.2) and followed or treated according 
to institutional guidelines or the treating physician’s medi cal judgment.   
7.2.2  Safety Considerations  
Physical examinations will be performed at screening,  within 24 hours prior to catheter placement  
and following CED infusion on Da ys 1 or 2 (according to infusion duration), 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 
180, 240, and 360 (or early termination). The screening and Day 360 (or early termi nation) 
examinations will be complete physical examinations; other examinations should be focused, at 
the discretion of the Investigator, to assess changes from the pre vious examination. Clin ically 
significant changes in physical examination findings during or after treatment, including transient 
neurological symptoms, will be reported as AEs.  
Other safety assessments will include vital signs. Th e Investigator or a designated associate will 
review all vital sign results, and clinically significant findings will be reported as AEs (see  Section 
8.2.2) and followed  or treated according to institutional guidelines or the treating physician’s 
medical judgment. Triplicate twelve -lead ECGs are taken during screening and within 2 hours

(Table 7). If serum anti-MDNA55 antibodie s are present, further immunogenicity assessments will 
be carried out for determination of antibody neutralization potential . Other immune parameters 
may also be assessed.  
All collected blood samples will be processed accordi ng to a laboratory manual and s amples will 
be stored at -70°C until instructions are provided to the site to shi p the samples to the central 
testing laboratory (MicroConstants Inc., San Diego, CA).

viable tumor tissue from along the planned trajectory of the CED catheter(s) .  
Tissue sample archived from initial GB diagnosis and/ or tissue sample archived following 
recurrence will be utilized for retrospective analysis of IL4R expression using 
immunohistochemistry (IHC). The tissue sample may also be  subject to retrospective analysis of 
other biomarkers, including but not be limited to methylation status of the MGMT gene ( Section 
7.3.2).  
Biomarker analyses will be conducted to determine if there is a correla tion between IL4R 
expression and/or MGMT status and treatment response to MDNA55.  
Tissue samples from biopsi es taken at the time of MDNA55 infusion will be evaluated for disease 
status, including assessment of the immunological state of the tumor.  
Analyses on other tumor tissue samples obtained duri ng other surgical procedures or local 
evaluations of disease status ( e.g. samples from repeat resections  or biopsies taken to establish

exploratory analyses.  
7.3.1 Biomarker Analysis including IL4R Expression  
Archived tumor tissue specimens from subjects entering the study  will be processed by [CONTACT_342759] a 
CLIA certified laboratory (QualTek Molecular Laborator ies, Goleta, CA) for retrospective analysis 
of IL4R expression to determine if there is a correlation between IL4R e xpression and tumor 
response following MDNA55 treatment.  Instructions for processing and submitting archived tissue  
are provided in the Study Reference Guide .  
Tissue sections will be graded for IL4R expression by [CONTACT_342760] a blinded 
fashion for each specimen using a semi -quantitative scale of 0, 1+, 2+ , and 3+ (as well as H -
Score). Further quantitative assessment of IL4R staining may include standardized image 
analysis. Efficacy endpoints ( such as PFS, ORR, OS , DOR, DOCB) will be evaluated versus 
intensity of IL4R expression.   
In addition, pre -anesthesia blood sample as well as pre -treatment tumor tissue specimens (from 
subjects where viable tissue can be harvested at the time of catheter placement) will be processed 
by [CONTACT_342761] ( Woburn, MA) for exploratory retrospective analysis of the tu mor 
microenvironment by [CONTACT_342762] (ribonucleic acid) based immune profile. Instructions for 
processing and submitting the blood and biopsy samples  are provided in the Study Reference 
Guide. 
7.3.2 O6-Methylguanine-Methyltransferase Analysis 
MGMT-expressing cancer cells (harboring unmethylated MGMT promoters and therefore 
resistant to temozolomide) are sensitive to MDNA55.  
Thus, tumor tissue specimens from subjects will be pr ocessed at a CLIA certified laboratory for 
MGMT DNA methylation analysis using a quantitative methy lation-specific PCR technique. 
Primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed agai nst the MGMT methyla tion status.

distinguish between true and pseudo -progression and confirm response  in GB patients at earlier 
time points (Ion-Mărgineanu et al., 2017; Thomas et al., 2015; Boxerman et al, 2014).

[IP_ADDRESS] Interruption or Discontinuation of Infusion  
If a subject experiences a clinically significant Grade 3 or 4 AE considered by [CONTACT_342768], the infusion will be stopped. Infusion 
may be restarted at the Investigator’s discretion if  the AE responds to medical manag ement; 
otherwise, the infusion should be discontinued permanently.  
Should an interruption of the infusion be due to obs erved mass effect / increased intracranial 
pressure (ICP), treatment with mannitol is suggested (see  Table 3) with infusion resuming after 
recovery (if possible), such that it can be completed within th e maximum infusion duration window 
of approximately 48 hours.  
Treatment may be discontinued at the di scretion of the Investigator. In the unlikely event that all 
catheters are placed erroneously (not in line with placement guidelines in section 6.3) or cannot 
be used (e.g. catheters do not function/convect), the procedure will be halted  and no infusion 
given to the subject.

7.5.4 Early Termination Visit  
Subjects who discontinue before the Day 360 visit will undergo all the procedures scheduled for 
the Day 360 visit if early termination is between follow -up visit time points. A new / repeat MRI will 
not be required if the last MRI  performed was within [ADDRESS_424506] for the early term ination assessment. When 
early termination is within 2 weeks following study follow up visit time point (i.e. D ay 30, 60, 90, 
120, 180 or 240) that visit will be considered the early termination time point and no additional 
assessments beyond the respective visit date assessments will be required. In the event that a 
subject is withdrawn from the study prior to the Day [ADDRESS_424507]-study follow-up should ensue 
(see Section 7.5.5 below). 
7.5.[ADDRESS_424508]-Study Follow- Up 
Subjects who complete the Day 360 assessment without di sease progression o r discontinue early 
without disease progression will continue to be follo wed for disease status until progression where 
possible. After progression (on study or during post -study follow-up), subjects will continue to be 
followed (by [CONTACT_342773]/caregiver) , where possible, for survival, post -study treatment(s) for GB and imaging for 
GB until death (or termination of data collection by [CONTACT_342774]).

 7.6 Usage of Concomitant Medications  
All concurrent medical conditions and complications of the underlying malignancy will be treated 
at the discretion of the Investigator according to acceptable local standards of medical care. 
Subjects should receive anal gesics, antiemetics, antibiotics, anti -pyretics, and blood products as 
necessary. Although warfarin -type anticoagulant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_86042], careful monitoring of 
coagulation parameters is imperative to avoid complications of any possible drug interacti ons. All 
concomitant medications, including transfusions of blood products, will be recorded in the EDC 
system.  
Guidelines for treating certain medical conditions ar e discussed below; however, institutional 
guidelines for the treatment of these conditions  may also be used. The concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_342702].  
7.6.1 Antiemetic Medications  
Dexamethasone and a 5 -HT3 blocker ( e.g., ondansetron or granisetron) may be administered to 
subjects as pre -medications unless contraindicated for the individua l subject. Antiemetics will also 
be prescribed as clinically indicated during the study period.  
7.6.[ADDRESS_424509]’s participation in the study:  
• Other anti-neoplastic therapy, including cytotoxics, targeted agents, endocrine therapy, or 
other antibodies, including Avastin ® (bevacizumab)  with any treatment intent . NOTE: 
Low-dose bevacizumab  (Avastin®) (doses typi[INVESTIGATOR_342703], see section 6.2)  use is permitted  
• Radiotherapy  
• Any other investigational therapy

progression-free disease assessment prior to the date of any subsequent re current GB treatment.  
PFS will be determined by [CONTACT_95733] -based assessments, adopting the general approaches 
described for  the modified RANO (mRANO) assessment with the response rubric  of iRANO (for 
immunotherapy agents). Additional response assessments will incorporate the use of advanced 
imaging modalities (e.g. MRI perfusion / diffusion assessme nts) in the m/iRANO approach , to 
support differentiation of true vs. pseudo progression / response.  
8.1.3 Objective Response Rate 
Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the proportion of su bjects who achieved a complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR) out of all treated subjects.  
According to the modified RANO criteria, a responder is defined by [CONTACT_342775] (Ellingson et al., 2017a). CR and PR together with Stable Disease (SD) and initial and 
confirmed Progressive Disease (PD)  will be first assessed by [CONTACT_342776]  [e.g.  
diffusion weighted imaging, perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast  and/or Tumor 
Response Assessm ent Maps (TRAMs), etc.] where available . In addition, deterioration of 
Protocol # MDNA55 -05 
Version: v.6.1   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 73  [19JUL2019]  
 neurologic function and  increase in steroid use will be  used to determine PD provided it is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_342777]/or biopsy since extended duration of pseudo -progression is 
frequently observed following immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_342705] 55 (Weber et al., 2003a; 2003b ; 
Okada et al., 2015).  
For the purpose of study endpoints , Objective Response (OR) status should be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_342778] 4 weeks.  Patients who receive low -dose bevacizumab  
(Avastin) treatment to control edema, a preliminary OR observed at least [ADDRESS_424511] ion / de-bulking with no histological 
evidence of recurrent tumor will have a best OR of SD following surgery and will continue to be 
followed by [CONTACT_342779].  
Imaging assessment will be carried out using comprehensiv e imaging guidelines to help identify 
pseudo-progression where possible.  
A blinded central review  will be employed to provide independent assessme nt of response  or 
progression following treatment with MDNA55  according to RANO -based criteria ( Wen et al., 
2010; Ellingson et al., 2017a) incorporating advanced imaging modalities . To rule out pseudo-
progression, advanced imaging modalities and/or biopsy will be utilized . 
8.1.4 Other Time-to-Event Endpoints 
The time-to-event endpoints are defined in  Table 8.

 8.2.1 Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  
An AE (also known as an adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. More 
specifically, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the u se of a drug, without any judgment 
about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug ( e.g., off-label use, use in combination 
with another drug) and from any rout e of administration, formulation, or dose, including an 
overdose.  
Any condition present before the catheter placement,  including pre -existing conditions and pre -
study AEs, will be considered medical history and will not be repo rted as a treatment -emergent 
AE unless the condition worsens during or after cathet er placement.  Any worsening ( i.e., any 
clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition, 
which is temporally associated with the use of the Spo nsor’s product, is also an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Reaction 
An adverse reaction is defined as any AE caused by [CONTACT_342780] a drug. Adverse reactions are a 
subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug 
caused the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected 
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
indicates that there is evidence to suggest a causal rel ationship between the drug and the AE. A 
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse 
reaction. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
Death 
Life-threatening AE  
Protocol # MDNA55 -05 
Version: v.6.1   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 76  [19JUL2019]  
 o an AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered life -threatening if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate ris k 
of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233003] 
o applies if the reported AE requires at least a 24 -hour in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109], if in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], prolongs an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298]. A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342706] a routinely scheduled treatment is  not an SAE by [CONTACT_342781] a “procedure” or a “t reatment” is not an untoward medical 
occurrence. An emergency room visit of less than [ADDRESS_424512] 
normal life function  
Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o applies if a subject exposed to a medicinal (investigational) product gives birth to a 
child with congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised i n determining seriousness in other 
situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening, result 
in death, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subjec t or may require intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These events should be considered 
serious and subject to reporting procedures specified below in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
8.2.[ADDRESS_424513] will 
be recorded in the appropriate section of the EDC System and evaluated  by [CONTACT_342782].  
Minimum information required for each AE includes descr iption of the event, duration (start and 
end dates), severity,  assessment of seriousness, and causal relationship to study drug and 
delivery/infusion procedure.  
Protocol # MDNA55 -05 
Version: v.6.1   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 77  [19JUL2019]  
 If discernible at the time of completing the AE section in the  EDC System, a specific disease or 
syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_342783]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign, symptom, or clinically significant laboratory anomaly is not considered 
by [CONTACT_63033] a co mponent of a specific disease or syndrome, then it sh ould be 
recorded as a separate AE in the appro priate AE section in the EDC System (clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities are those that are identified as such by [CONTACT_11219]/or those t hat 
require intervention).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Relatedness of Adverse Events   
The Investigator will assign attribution of the possi ble association of the event with use of the 
investigational drug and, separately, for the surgical/infu sion procedure (i.e. AEs that occur duri ng 
catheter placement prior to start of infusion of study treatment versus AEs with onset after start 
of infusion). Relationship will be determined for each as follows:  
• Related:  There is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the drug and the 
AE, such as: 
o An event that is uncommon and known to be strongly as sociated with drug 
exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
o An event that is not commonly associated with drug ex posure, but is otherwise 
uncommon in the population exposed to the drug ( e.g., tendon rupture)  
• Unrelated:  Another cause of the AE is more plausible ( e.g., due to underlying disease or 
occurs commonly in the study population), or a temporal sequence cannot be established 
with the onset of the AE and  administration of the study treatment, or a causal relationship 
is considered biologically implausible.  
In general, AEs that are worsening of baseline or pre -existing conditions are considered 
unrelated, unless there is reason to believe that the worsening was attributable to the 
investigational drug. Further, if death occurs due to pr ogressive disease it is not considered 
attributable to MDNA55.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of AEs  will be graded and recorded by [CONTACT_342784] g the National Cancer 
Institute CTCAE version 4.0 guidelines. When specific AEs are not listed in the CTCAE 4.0 they 
Protocol # MDNA55 -05 
Version: v.6.1   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 78  [19JUL2019]  
 will be graded by [CONTACT_40608], mild, moderate or severe according to the following 
grades and definitions:  
Grade Definition  
Grade 0 No AE (or within normal limits)  
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnost ic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention (e.g., packing, cautery) 
indicated; limiting a ge-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL 
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5: Death related to AE  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow-up of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be followed with appropriate medical management u ntil resolved. Subjects withdrawn 
from study for unacceptable AEs will be followed until resolution or stabilization of  the AE. For 
selected AE for which administration of the investigational drug was stopped, a re -challenge of 
the subject with the investigational drug may be conducted if considered both safe and ethical by 
[CONTACT_737].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event Reporting   
Within 24 hours of becoming aware of any SAE (regardless of its relationship to  investigational 
product) that occurs during the course of the clinical study up until [ADDRESS_424514] notify the pharmacovigila nce vendor, ProPharma, within 24 
hours of discovery using a written repor t (SAE Report Form) via Fax or Email as outlined in table 
below (the SAE Report Form must be submitted by [CONTACT_11255] 24 hours even if it is 
incomplete). This ensures timely reporting of applicable rep orts to the applicable Health 
Authorities. The form  must be signed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_45277], and if not available, 
the unsigned report should be faxed/emailed for initial proce ssing and resubmitted after the 
Investigator’s signature [CONTACT_342811].

 Serious Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) Reporting to Sites:  
ProPharma will provide a S[LOCATION_003]R safety packet to all study Investiga tors at which point site must 
submit the S[LOCATION_003]R safety packet to their IRB/IEC according to their local requirements.  
Site must also observe the statutory reporting time frame for expedited reporting of all S[LOCATION_003]Rs

Fatal or life threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs:  
Not later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor has  information that the case reported fulfils the 
criteria for a fatal or life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]R, with any follow up information to be reported within 
a further 8 calendar days.  
All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs:  
Not later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor ha s information that the case fulfilled the criteria 
for a S[LOCATION_003]R.

responsible for recording in the subject’s source document a ny pregnancy during or within [ADDRESS_424515] be followed by [CONTACT_342785]. The outcome of the birth 
(health of infant) must be reported to the Medical Monitor.  
9 Statistical Methods  
The primary efficacy analysis of OS will be assessed according to a single -arm, single-stage 
design on the ITT population. OS will be determined via Kaplan -Meier estimation, with medians, 
quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reported. mOS will tested using a single sample one 
sided log-rank test on a 10% significance level against historical control . 
A secondary analysis of the primary variable will be conducted in the IL4 -R population according 
to IL4-R status.  
PFS will be assessed and summarized as OS.  
Protocol # MDNA55 -05 
Version: v.6.1   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Medicenna Therapeutics  Inc. Page 81  [19JUL2019]  
 Descriptive analysis of the OS and PFS at 6, 9, and 12 m onths after treatment will be based on 
the raw proportions of subjects surviving (and progression -free) at those time points as well as 
Kaplan-Meier estimation.  Further analyses will also be conducted by [CONTACT_8668]4R stratu m, including 
examination of the treatment effect by [CONTACT_8668]4R level.  
Efficacy analyses may also explore subject subsets (e.g. IL4R level, t umor size, KPS, gender, 
age, steroid use,) and response by [CONTACT_342720].  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for subject d emographics and disposition, safety, and 
exposure data and will include the number of observations, mean, standard dev iation, median, 
and range for continuous variables and number and percent for categorical variables; 95% CIs 
will be presented where appropriate.  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size is calculat ed for the primary analysis  and based on the following assumptions: 
uniform accrual over time, no loss to follow -up, exponentially distributed death times, use of the 
exponential MLE test, follow-up time [ADDRESS_424516] on a 10% significance  level. 
With a null hypothesis  of a median OS of [ADDRESS_424517] will be  over 80% with 46 evaluable subjects.   
9.2 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The primary analysis will occur when median survival is reached (> 50% of all subjects have died) 
or all subjects have completed the Day [ADDRESS_424518] deviation, median, and range for continuous 
variables; 95% confidence intervals ( CIs) will be presented as ap propriate. 
9.2.1 Randomization 
This study is a single -arm design. All subjects will receive active treatment. No randomization will 
be performed.  
Protocol # MDNA55 -05

 9.2.[ADDRESS_424519] through recruitment, local tissue reactions, 
inflammation, immune cell infiltration, edema and/or necrosis,  subsequent to MDNA55 
administration, was observed in some subjects and has been seen to be indistinguishable from 
possible tumor growth using the imaging techniques adopted from the outset of this study. 
Therefore, obtaining reliable imaging data for the p rimary efficacy analysis has been shown to be 
confounded. Consequently, under protocol version 6.0,  the surrogate endpoint Objective 
Response Rate (ORR) will be assessed as a secondary outc ome measure with the median 
Overall Survival (mOS) becoming the primary variable.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Intent to Treat (ITT) 
An ITT population will comprise all subjects who receive  any amount of study drug will be used 
for the primary efficacy analyses, other purely survival-based endpoints  and all safety analyses .  
A modified ITT population for secondary  imaging-based analyses, including PFS,  (mITT, see 
below) will comprise all subjects who receive any amount of study drug and have adequa te 
imaging or clinical data for the ORR analysis. NOTE: Patient s who expi[INVESTIGATOR_342707].   
[IP_ADDRESS] Per Protocol (PP) Population 
The PP population will comprise all patients in the ITT p opulation (or mITT for imaging -based 
endpoints) who also have no major protocol violations during th e study. This population will be 
finalized prior to the final lock and primary analysis of the study data. Efficacy analyses will be 
conducted on this population in support of the primary efficacy results.  
[IP_ADDRESS] IL4R Analysis Population 
The IL4R Analysis Population will be the same as the ITT Po pulation, excluding patients who do 
not have archived tissue or adequate tissue available for analysis,  and will be used for efficacy 
analyses in subgroups according to IL4R expression status  (Section 9.2.9). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Population 
The Safety population will comprise all patients treat ed on study. Safety analyses will be 
presented on this population.

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Variable 
OS will be defined as the time (in weeks) from start o f the CED infusion until death from any 
cause. Subjects not know to have died at the time of the analysis will be censored a t the time of 
last contact. 
OS and will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method and tested using a single sample one 
sided log-rank test on a 10% significance level with null hypothesis of OS 8 months and alternative 
hypothesis of OS > 8 months. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Variables 
Secondary efficacy variables will include OS variants, ORR  and PFS. 
ORR will be presented as the percentage of subjects with CRs or PRs by [CONTACT_342786] -based 
criteria, including those  incorporating advanced imaging modalities ; only confirmed responses will 
be presented (i.e., those observed on 2 consecutive MRI scans not less tha n 4 weeks apart and 
at appropriate interval following discontinuation of bevacizumab  if response was not obs erved 
prior to use of bevacizumab ).  
PFS will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method . PFS will be assessed using a single 
sample log-rank test (against historical control) at 10% significance level with null hypothesis of 
mPFS 4 months and alternative hypothesis of mPFS  > 4 months. PFS will be defined as the time

 (in weeks) from start of the CED infusion until radiologic or ne urologic disease progression or 
death from any cause. Subjects not know to have died or experienced disea se progression at the 
time of the analysis will be censored at the time of the las t radiologic assessment demonstrating 
lack of progression or, if during the follow -up period, the time of last contact [CONTACT_342787]. 
Graphical displays and incidence estimates will show PFS and OS at 6, 9, and 12  months. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Efficacy Variables and Analyses  
DOR will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method, including graphical displays. DOR will 
be calculated only for the subset of subjects with a respon se (CR or PR), and it will be defined as 
the time (in weeks) from first response until radiologic diseas e progression or death from any 
cause. Responders alive and progression -free at the time of the analysis will be censored at the 
time of the last radiol ogic assessment demonstrating lack of progression or, if during the follow -
up period, the time of last contact [CONTACT_342788].  
DOCB will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method, similar to DOR. DOCB will be 
calculated only for the subse t of subjects with a stable disease or better (CR, PR, or SD), and  it 
will be defined as the time (in weeks) from first res ponse until radiologic disease progression or 
death from any cause. Censoring will be performed in a fashion similar to DOR.  
Additional, exploratory, efficacy variables may include ORR and PFS based on the Investigator’s 
assessment of response and other time -to-event endpoints ( e.g., time to post -study treatment of 
GB). Analyses will also be conducted by [CONTACT_8668]4R stratum , including examination of the treatment 
effect by [CONTACT_8668]4R level.  
Efficacy analyses will also explore subject subsets ( procedural success, IL4R level, sequence 
number by [CONTACT_3725] [learning], tumor size, tumor coverage, time of infusion, maximum flow rate,  
number of catheters, percentage of planned infusate administered, KPS, gender, age, steroid 
use, immune status) and response by [CONTACT_342720]. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses 
comparing subjects included before and after protocol version 3.0 may be explored.

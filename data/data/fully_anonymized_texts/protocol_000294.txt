 Background and Rationale 
An important component in the pre-operative patient evaluation is to establish the 
duration of time a patient has been fasting in order to reduce the risk of pulmonary 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].1 An inadequate fasting time may prompt a change in anesthetic plans or 
result in the delay or cancellation of a case altogether. The risk of anesthetic-related 
pulmonary aspi[INVESTIGATOR_50494], with the incidence in 
adults cited around 0.05% or less.2, 3, [ADDRESS_52809] healthy, fasted 
patients can be up to 1.5 ml/kg.5  
Current guidelines recommend a minimum fasting period of 8 hours for fatty foods, 6 
hours for nonhuman milk and non-fatty solid foods, and 2 hours for clear liquids. 
Acceptable examples of clear liquids include water, black coffee or tea, carbonated 
beverages, and fruit juices without pulp.1 However, about 68% of adults in the United 
States consume coffee with add-ins such as cream and/or sugar.6 One study by [CONTACT_50499].7 found that adding up to 50% full fat milk to coffee led to no or minimal increase in 
gastric volume measured by [CONTACT_50500] [ADDRESS_52810] et al.8 
examined the addition of milk to tea and found no difference in gastric emptying times 
using the paracetamol absorption technique and ultrasound measurement of the gastric 
antrum. These studies provide some useful insight on gastric emptying times but are not 
generalizable to beverage consumption in the [LOCATION_002]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the volume of 
coffee consumed is larger than that in Europe and half and half is preferred to milk. Half 
and half is a mixture of milk and cream and has a fat content ranging from 10.5-18% 
compared to 3.25% fat in whole milk.9 Non-dairy coffee creamer is another popular 
addition to coffee, which consists of vegetable oil and corn syrup. This adds both fat and 
sugar to coffee. Therefore, the effects of larger quantities of coffee with the addition of 
high fat content milk products on gastric emptying is unknown. We propose a volunteer 
cross-over study in healthy individuals to assess the effects of milk additives to coffee 
and its effects on gastric emptying. In this study we will compare two separate additions 
to the coffee using half and half and liquid non-dairy coffee creamer.  
 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to compare gastric volume using bedside 
ultrasound in volunteers 2 hours after consumption of black coffee, coffee with half and 
half, and coffee with non-dairy creamer.

Study Design and Procedures (sometimes called “Methods”) 
This study is a randomized controlled crossover study with 3 arms. One arm is the 
consumption of a 12 ounce (354.8 ml) brewed black coffee. The second is a 12 ounce 
brewed black coffee plus 1 ounce (30 ml) of half and half. The third arm is a 12 ounce 
brewed black coffee plus 1 ounce (30 ml) of non-dairy coffee creamer. Each subject will 
participate in all [ADDRESS_52811] or negative consequence for 
participating or not. A total of 2 reminder emails will also be sent 1 week apart from 
each other and the initial recruitment email. No recruitment will occur in person to avoid 
potential pressure from a colleague/peer. 
Inclusion Criteria 
● Age between 18-65

 Exclusion Criteria 
● History of diabetes, delayed gastric emptying, previous gastric surgery, lactose 
intolerance, currently pregnant, consumption of solid/liquids in [ADDRESS_52812] deviation 
and statistical significance. We will also determine if the gastric volumes after 
consumption of coffee in each arm exceeds 1.5 ml/kg.

Study participants will be provided with information outlining the process of the study in 
the recruitment email. They will be fully informed that their participation requires the 
consumption of three different coffee drinks on three separate occasions along with 
ultrasound examinations by [CONTACT_50501]. They will be informed that 
the data collected will be de-identified. This is a minimal risk study and a waiver of 
documentation of consent is requested. The research involves no more than minimal 
risk to the subjects and the research involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context. 
 
Dissemination of Data 
Results of this study may be used for presentations, posters, or publications. The 
publications will not contain any identifiable information that could be linked to a 
participant.

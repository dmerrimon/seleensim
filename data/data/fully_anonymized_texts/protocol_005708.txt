Version Date: 10.24 .2018  A.  SPECIFIC AIMS  
The overall goal of this study is to investigate the signal intensity and relaxation rate characteristics of 
gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem, Guerbet , [LOCATION_003]) enhanced myocardium during rest and stress 
perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) compared to gadobutrol (Gadavsit)  to prove that 
Dotarem provides constantly high myocardial relaxation necessary for accurate quantitative perfusion 
evaluat ion. Within this overall goal, the following specific aims will be pursued:  
 Aim 1:  To test the hypothesis that the signal intensity enhancement during Dotarem 
myocardial stress/rest perfusion is relatively constant, providing linear and stable 
enhancement  in the myocardium, and is not inferior compared to gadobutrol (Gadavist).  
 Aim 2:  To test the hypothesis that the relaxation rate enhancement during Dotarem 
myocardial rest perfusion is uniform in the myocardium.  
 
B.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNI FICANCE  
Stress perfusion imaging is indicated in symptomatic patients suspected of coronary artery disease 
(CAD) with low or intermediate cardiovascular risk and typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/atypi[INVESTIGATOR_779874] -equivalent 
symptoms, as well as in asymptomatic patients with hi gh cardiovascular risk profiles, such as diabetics, 
or in patients with known CAD during follow -up.[ADDRESS_1071988] agent (CA) within the myocardium. Whereas the stress protocol used for both 
methods is similar, CMR offers the benefit of superior spatial and temporal resolution, and SPECT is 
associated with the negative effects of exposure to ionizing radiation.3, [ADDRESS_1071989] agents.11 This high stability is due to its molecular 
structure, which provides a significantly reduced dissociation rate (i.e. Release of free gadolinium  ions) 
compared to other agents.11 While the in vitro  relaxivity (3.4 mm-1s-1)[ADDRESS_1071990] that its high stability and extremely low dissociation rate provide constant 
signal intensity and relaxation rate enhancement during myocardial perfusion CMR, improving the 
accuracy and reliability of quant itative perfusion analysis.  
The efficacy of Dotarem enhanced late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging has been investigated 
and compared to gadobutrol (Gadavist, Bayer, [LOCATION_013]) to visualize and quantify myocardial scar.13 
However, a similar comparison for the assessment of myocardial ischemia by [CONTACT_779882] – an even more crucial step in a clinical CMR protocol – would further strengthen the value 
of Dotarem in cardiovascular imaging. While LG E is able to visualize irreversible myocardial injury, 
myocardial perfusion imaging has the ability to depi[INVESTIGATOR_779875].  
 
C.  PRELIMINARY STUDIES  
Our research group consists of clinical and research faculty who have extensive experience and a 
substantial publication record related to contrast enhanced cardiac  MRI and contrast agent 
characterization .14-[ADDRESS_1071991], o ur team developed an image a nalysis technique 
(detailed in Section D) that we will use in Aim 2 to investigate the relaxation profile of Dotarem.16

D.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS (INCLUDING D ATA ANALYSIS)  
D.1  IMAGE ACQUISITION  
This prospective study will include a total of 9 0 patients (Aim 1 + Aim 2) who present to the MUSC 
Radiology Department for a clinically indicated cardiac MRI  scan  over a 2 -year period . Patients will be 
imaged  using a state of the art 1.5T scanner (MAGNETOM Avanto, Siemens  Healthcare, Erlangen, 
[LOCATION_013]) system.  
Aim 1:  In this specific aim, a total of [ADDRESS_1071992] -enhanced stress perfusion protocol  (regadenoson 0.4mg 
bolus) detailed in Figure 1. Patients will be randomized into two groups prior to patient consenting : 
Group 1 (n=30)  will receive the clinically approved gadoterate meglumine  (Dotare m, 0.1mmol/kg ) as 
contrast agent for their clinical perfusion study, while Group 2 (n=30)  will receive the clinically 
approved gadobutrol  (Gadavist , 0.1mmol/kg ) as contrast agent.  The contrast agents will be 
administered at a flow rate of 5.0 ml/s for both groups.  In this study aim, all imaging protocols will 
comply with standard  of care  and only the perfusion data will be post -processed and analy zed. 
Aim 2 : In this specific aim, a total of [ADDRESS_1071993] enhanced 
cardiac MRI will be included. These patients will undergo a clinical viabili ty cardiac MRI protocol  with 
the administration of gadoterate meglumine  (Dotarem, 0.1mmol/kg ), except that a prototype MRI T1 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_779876] T1 maps during the first pass of the 
contrast agent. This first pass perfusion step will be performed in rest, no stress agent will be 
administered. The rest perfusion acquisition is part of the standard protocol, howev er, we will use this 
prototype pulse sequence for research purposes.

Version Date: 10.24 .2018  D.2  IMAGE ANALYSIS  
In Aim 1, we will generate s ignal intensity -time curves from the perfusion data and evaluate the 
characteristics of signal intensity changes and absolute myocardial blood flow using the MASS 
Research Software (LUMC, Leiden, Netherlands). The signal characteristics will be compared between 
the two contrast groups. Image quality will al so be subjectively rated by [CONTACT_779883].  
In Aim 2, we will generate e quilibrium T1 map s based on the  pre-contrast T1 and repeated inversion 
recovery  images during the perfusion of the CA. This technique allows the calculation of the pos t-
contrast T1 at every phase during the  first-pass perfusion of the CA . The uniformity of T1 and R1 
(inverse T1) will be evaluated using the MASS Research Software.  
 
D.3 STATISTICAL METHODS / SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIF ICATION  
All analyses and graphs will be performed by [CONTACT_779884] (MedCalc version 
12.7.2; SPSS version 21). Descriptive statistics will be provided as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for 
continuous variables and absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables . Normal data 
distribution will be assessed with a Kolmogorov -Smirnov test. For each group, comparisons of patient 
characteristics will be performed by [CONTACT_10540] χ² test for categorical variables and t -test or Mann -
Whitney -U-test for continuous variables a s appropriate.  Subjective image quality scores will be 
compared using  the χ² test with the Yates continuity correction for categorical variables and inter -
observer agreement for image quality will be calculated using Cohen kappa  statistics and interpreted  
as follows: ≤0.20 slight or poor agreement, 0.20 –0.40 fair agreement, 0.40 –0.80 moderate agreement,

E.1.b  Sources of Materials  
The research materials that will be obtained from living human subjects are: the MR images, report, 
injection report , progress notes, medication records, vital signs, medical history and demographics , 
and all other applicable clinical information.   
 
The Principal  Investigator, Sub -Investigator(s) and the Study Coordinator(s) will be the only personnel 
who will have access to subject identities, with the exception of an y regulatory personnel (MUSC IRB 
auditors, etc.). All subject identities will be removed prior to publication.  
 
Contrast and Drug Management  
Contrast agents (Dotarem and Gadavist) and stress agent (Regadenoson) will be ordered and 
dispensed from the MUSC inpatient pharmacy per clinical protocol.  
 
 
E.1.c  Potential Risks  
Vein puncture  
Patients could experience bruising, pain, and rare incidence of infection at the vein puncture site.  This 
is like a blood test. This puncture is used to inject the contrast agents. Care will be taken to avoid these 
possible risks. Skin or vein irritation, fainting, blood clot formation, bleeding at the injection site, or an 
infection could also occur.  
 
Adverse reactions caused by [CONTACT_779885], independently from the 
research component of the study. The research protocol will not increase the risk of contrast related 
adverse reactions in any of the research aims. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_779877] 
 
8 
Version Date: 10.[ADDRESS_1072000] material may cause further deterioration in renal function. Therefore, patients with decreased 
renal function (more than 1.50 mg/d L serum creatinine ) will be excluded from this study.   
 
Risks from Contrast Agent  Extravasation  
Although extremely rare, it is possible that an IV needle is not properly located within the vein or 
becomes dislodged when the patient lies down on the examination table. When contrast material is 
injected, it may then leak into the surrounding tissue. Th is can be painful and in very few instances has 
been reported to cause pressure on underlying nerves or vessels that needs to be surgically relieved. 
Usually, however, a contrast media extravasation is noticed early on by [CONTACT_779886]. However, even if a full dose of contrast material is injected in the tissue surrounding a vein, 
permanent damage is extremely unlikely. Usually the contrast material is fully absorbed by [CONTACT_779887] a day without any harmful effect. In addition, in our department we use the latest automated 
contrast media injector generation, which also comprises of an automated extravasation detection 
device attached to the arm of the patient. Since the implementation of this device we have not 
experienced any ma jor extravasation of contrast material.  
 
Adverse reactions caused by [CONTACT_779888] (Lexiscan): 
Myocardial ischemia, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal bl ock, hypotension, bronchoconstriction. 
The following adverse reactions associated with regadenoson are considered transient and are listed 
in the package insert: dyspnea or urge to breathe deeply, headache, flushing, chest discomfort, angina 
pectoris or ST  segment depression, lightheadedness/dizziness, chest pain, nausea, abdominal 
discomfort , impaired taste, feeling hot. In addition,  dyspnea can occur during stress myocardial 
perfusion imaging with associated arrhythmias such as hypoxia induced bundle bran ch block. The first 
signs of these rare side effects will cause the termination of the examination.  Note, that stress agent 
will not be administered for research purposes.  
 
Risk of metal objects in the body  
Patients may suffer bodily harm in the course of  the MR A examination from having metal objects in 
their clothing, from metal implants (e.g. pacemaker, implanted defibrillator, cochlear implants, 
cerebral aneurysm clips), or any other metal within the body (shrapnel, bullet or metal fragments). 
Before pa tients undergo the procedure, they will be prompted to take out any metal objects. Patients 
will be asked a series of detailed questions about any metal that they may have their body.  
 
Acquisition of patient information  
The risks associated with gathering this information are believed to be very low. This information will 
be stored on a password -protected computer and network server and in a locked office (ART Cardiac 
Imaging Research Office ). The data from this study will be accessible only to the team of researchers 
from this application.  
 
E.[ADDRESS_1072001] been referred for a  stress myocardial perfusion MRI (Aim 1) or myocardial viability 
MRI (Aim 2)  as part of a standard clinical evaluation determined by [CONTACT_1963](s) will be 
eligible for the study and recruited from the MUSC MRI schedule . The MRI technologist or member of 
the nursing staff will speak with potential subjects to ensure the ir willingness to be approached by a 
member of the research team . Willing patients will be approached and will undergo the informed 
 
9 
Version Date: 10.[ADDRESS_1072002] 
stress protocol (Aim 1) o r the modified viability  protocol  (Aim 2) .  
 
Patients will be screened by [CONTACT_779889] a HIPAA 
waiver.  Study eligibility determination and study enrollment will be assessed and performed b y and 
investigator in concert with a study coordinator delegated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_779878].  
 
The PI, Sub -I(s) or the Study Coordinator(s)  will obtain informed consent prior to enrollment into the 
study. The subject will be taken to a quiet/private area (which may include the scanning room, the 
patient bays or other private areas) and the study purpose, procedures, duration, risks/discomforts, 
benefits , alternatives, new information procedures and privacy statements will be explained to the 
subject.  
 
The subject will be asked to verbally repeat pertinent  study information to ensure subject understands 
the nature of the researc h. Subjects will be provided the opportunity to ask any questions they may 
have. Consent will be documented in the currently IRB approved version of the informed consent and 
will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_779890].  
 
E.2.b  Protection against Risk  
To minimize the risk of post -contrast nephropathy, patients with decreased renal function (creatinine 
>1.5 mg/dL ) will not be eligible for this study. To minimize the risk of allergic reactions to gadolinium  
contrast materi al, patients with a history of allergic reactions to gadolinium  contrast material will also 
be excluded.  
 
All subjects’ medical records will be confined in the usual medical health information office according 
to their policies and procedures. Each staff member that has approved access to electronic medical 
records will be given their own password and will be instructed not to reveal that password to anyone 
else. In addition, those copi[INVESTIGATOR_779879] (ART 2244) in a research specific folder  that will identify the 
subject on the outside of the folder  only by [CONTACT_10573], subject code (subsequent subject identifiers, i.e. 
001, 002, 003, etc., this number will not be  able to identify the subject), protocol name, and IRB study 
number ( Pro #). Any data that are used in publication, analyses, etc. will not identify the subject by 
[CONTACT_2300], etc.  Subjects will be monitored in clinic as per clinical standard practice for any po ssible side 
effects and treated as indicated.  
 
E.3  POTENTIAL BENEF ITS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO THE SUBJ ECTS AND OTHERS  
The subjects whose data, documents, and records will be reviewed are not likely to receive any benefit 
from the proposed research. Ho wever, the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of myocardial 
perfusion has an important role in patient diagnosis , therapy and prognosis. The improved and more 
reliable detection of myocardial perfusion defects may provide faster diagnosis and better patient 
management, as well as avoid unnecessary tests (including invasive procedures and radiation 
exposure). As of today, Dotarem is the only  gadolinium -based contrast agent without any reported 
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis case. Broadening the clinical use of Dotarem towards the cardiac MRI 
field would provide substantial benefit to patients, especially those who suffer from pre -existing rena l 
disease.

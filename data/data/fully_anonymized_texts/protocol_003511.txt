committee (i.e., Brown University Institutional Review Board (IRB)) approved before the trial 
began.  
 
The original protocol that was submitted to the Brown IRB on December 5, 2014 was a pi[INVESTIGATOR_424658] -BP Stage 1 Single Arm Clinical Trial funded by [CONTACT_156490]. In 
September 2015, t he study PI (Loucks) was awarded a five year  NIH UH2/UH3  grant ( 1 UH2 
AT009145 -01 entitled “Mindfulness Influences on  Self-Regulation: Mental and Physical Health 
Implications” ). With this funding, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_424659].  Data from the NIH -funded study are

Section A:  
Lay-Person Summary of Proposed Project  
  
 3 1 Specific Aims  
 
1. To formally develop a Mindfulness -Based Hypertension Therapy  (MBHT) intervention tailored to the 
needs for  hypertensive patients, util izing  a multi -disciplinary team of experts and patients, and 
incorporating a Delphi- like technique to adapt  protocols of a standardized mindfulness- based 
intervention dev eloped at UMass Medical School for patients with p rehypertension or hypertension.  
2. To determine the optimal dose of the intervention developed in aim 1. We will estimate the feasibility, 
acceptability  and safety of two different do ses of the MBHT intervention  in 60 patients (30 per dose 
arm) randomly assigned to a “low” or “high” dose of MBH T.  
3. To finalize the protocol of the MBHT intervent ion and design of the future  RCT . We will use the results 
of our developmental work (aim 1) and of the dosing study (aim 2) to make the final adjustments to the 
protocol of the intervention that will be tes ted for efficacy in our future RCT, incorporating the expertise 
of our interdisciplinary panel to optimize the de sign of the future RCT .  
[ADDRESS_536818] uncontrolled 
BP.3,4 This is despi[INVESTIGATOR_424664], obesity, 
physical activity, medication adherence and excessive alcohol consumption.5,6 Mindfulness interventions 
appear to improve self -regulation, self- care, and the ability to not respond to cravings  for hypertension risk 
factors such as  high caloric palatable foods and sedentary activities  (and resul ting obesity) .7-[ADDRESS_536819], a 2009 
Institute of Medicine report recommended prioritizing research to “Compare the effectiveness of mindfulness -
based interventions (e.g. yoga, meditation, deep breathing training) and usual care in treating… cardiovascular 
risk factors. ”12 Evidence -based mindfulness interventions including Mindfulness -Based Stress R eduction 
(MBSR) may have some effects, where a recent meta -analysis and systematic revie w of 4 randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated significant effects, but evidence of heterogen eity in effect sizes .[ADDRESS_536820] rigorous evaluation to date on 
whether MBSR customized to prehypertensive and hypertensive patients provides clinically relevant reductions 
in BP.  
3 Approach  
3.1 Initial Development of High and Low -Dose MBHT (Aim 1) 
We will assemble a team of e xperts in cardiology  (e.g. Dudley, Wu, Shimbo) , family medicine  (e.g. Eaton), 
physical activity  (e.g. William s, Davidson), diet  (e.g. McCaffery), medication adherence (e.g. Kronish) , 
mindfulness interventions  (e.g. Britton , Salmoirago -Blotcher, Brewer) , and patients with prehypertension or 
hypertension. With this team, we use an iterative, Delphi -like technique to adapt  protocols of a standardized 
mindfulness -based intervention developed at UMass Medical School, called MBSR , for patients with 
prehypertension or hypertension, to the unique safety and treatment needs of this population. Adaptions may include, for example, types of specific mindfulness exercise s, sequence in which they are introduced, and 
relative emphasis on hypertension education vs. mindfuln ess practice components.  
3.2 Study Population  (Aim 2)  
Participants will be recruited through cardiology and family practices via established relationships with 
physicians at Rhode Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (e.g. Sam Dudley, MD) , Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424665]  (e.g. C harles 
 4 Eaton, MD) , Providence VA M edical Center (e.g. Hank Wu, MD), amongst others . Furthermore, 
advertisements will be posted throughout Rhode Island inviting participants with pre -hypertension or 
hypertension to enroll. For Aim 2,  we anticipate n= 60 participants with equal proportions of males and females, 
and stratified across prehypertension/hypertension categories, including (1) pre -hypertension, (2) controlled 
hypertension, and (3) uncontrolled hypertension. This will allow for early indications of po tential differential 
effects of MBHT by [CONTACT_424887]/hypertension status.  
Inclusion Criterion: Hypertension/prehypertension (≥120 mmHg systolic, ≥80 mmHg diastolic pressure or 
taking antihypertensive medication).  
Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria follow standard guidelines :16 current regular meditation practice 
(>once/wee k); current substance abuse, suicidal ideation or eating disorder; history of bipolar or psychotic 
disorders or self -injurious behaviors.  
3.3 MBHT Intervention Group s 
High Dose:  MBHT is based on the standardized MBSR  intervention  described elsewhere ,17-[ADDRESS_536821] investigating 
associations of mindfulness w ith cardiovascular health .11,21,22 The unique areas of MBHT  are expected to be 
education on hypertension risk factors , hypertension health ef fects, and speci fic mindfulness modules focused  
on awareness of diet, phy sical activity, medication adherence, alcohol consumption, stress, and social support 
for behavior change. A preliminary manual has been created based on the standardized MBSR manual 
developed at UMass Medical School, and will be further developed through the Delphi -like approach described 
above, and sequentially revised based on participant feedback and preliminary findings.19,20 MBHT sessions 
contain instruction and practice in mindfulness meditation, and conversations about stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Students learn a range of mindfulness skills including body sca n exercises, meditation and yoga. Homework 
consists o f practicing skills for ≥45 min/day, 6 days/week . Booster sessions will be offered  (likely 2.5 -hour 
sessions every 2 months ).  
Low Dose:  Low Dose MBHT will be based on the High Dose intervention above, but instead prioritizing 
practices to fit within nine 1- hour weekly groups sessions. Through the aforementioned Delphi -like approach, 
the most salient parts of the high dose interv ention described above will be offered in  low dose MBHT.   
3.4 Measures of Compliance  
Participant Adherence:  Data on treatment protocol adherence will be collected weekly by [CONTACT_3647].  
MBHT  Instructor Competency and Treatment Fidelity: Treatment fidelity strategies will be performed in 
accordance with recommendations of the NIH Behavior Change consortium .23 
3.5 Blinding  
All study staff, including those  performing health assessments and contact[CONTACT_220379] t o schedule 
follow -up assessments , will be blinded to treatment alloc ation with the exception of the MBHT instructor  
(Loucks) and data manager (who performs randomization).  
3.6 Equipoise  
This study will be designed to disrupt clinical equipoise, defined as “no consensus within the expert clinical 
community about the comparative merits of the alternative [trial arms] to be tested .”[ADDRESS_536822]-intervention . Major assessment variables are shown in Table 1. Qualitative interviews 
(likely focus groups) will evaluate participants’ experiences such as usefulness of specific modules, duration of

Specific Aims and Methodology  
  
 [ADDRESS_536828] uncontrolled BP.3,4 This is despi[INVESTIGATOR_424666], obesity, physical activity, medication adherence and excessive alcohol 
consumption.5,6 Mindfulness interventions appear to improve self -regulation, self- care, and the ability to 
not respond to cravings for hypertension risk factors such as high caloric palatable foods and sedentary 
activities (and result ing obesity).7-[ADDRESS_536829], a 2009 Institute of Medicine report recommended prioritizing 
research to “Compare the effectiveness of mindfulness -based interventions (e.g. yoga, meditation, deep 
breathing training) and usual care in treating… cardiovascular risk factors. ”12 Evidence -based 
mindf ulness interventions including Mindfulness -Based Stress R eduction (MBSR) may have some 
effects, where a recent meta -analysis and systematic review of 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
demonstrated significant effects, but evidence of heterogen eity in effect sizes .[ADDRESS_536830] rigorous evaluation to date 
on whether MBSR customized to prehypertensive and hypertensive patients provides clinically relevant reductions in BP. These preliminary findings will set the stage for NIH applications, including R34 and 
R01 applications.   
2 Specific Aims  
1 To formally develop a Min dfulness -Based Hypertension Therapy (MBHT) intervention tailored to the 
needs for hypertensive patients, utilizing a multi -disciplinary team of experts and patients, and 
incorporating a Delphi- like technique to adapt protocols of a standardized mindfulness -based 
intervention developed at UMass Medical School for patients with prehypertension or hypertension.  
2 To determine the optimal dose of the intervention developed in aim 1. We will estimate the feasibility, 
acceptability and safety of two different doses  of the MBHT intervention in 60 patients (30 per dose 
arm) randomly assigned to a “low” or “high” dose of MBHT.  
[ADDRESS_536831]. We will use the 
results of our developmental work (aim 1) and o f the dosing study (aim 2) to make the final 
adjustments to the protocol of the intervention that will be tested for efficacy in our future RCT, incorporating the expertise of our interdisciplinary panel to optimize the design of the future RCT.  
4 Approach  
4.1 Initial Development of High and Low -Dose MBHT (Aim 1) 
We will assemble a team of experts in cardiology  (e.g. Dudley, Wu, Shimbo), family medicine  (e.g. 
Eaton) , physical activity  (e.g. Williams, Davidson), diet (e.g. McCaffery), medication adherence (e.g. 
Kronish) , mindfulness interventions (e.g. Britton, Salmoirago -Blotcher, Brewer), and patients with 
prehypertension or hypertension. With this team, we use an iterative, Delphi -like technique to adapt  
protocols of a standardized mindfulness- based intervention developed at UMass Medical School, called 
MBSR , for patients with prehypertension or hypertension, to the unique safety and treatment needs of 
this population. Adaptions may include, for example, types of specific mindfulness exercise s, sequence 
in which  they are introduced, and relative emphasis on hypertension education vs. mindfulness practice 
components.  
 11 4.2 Study Population (Aim 2)  
Participants will be recruited through cardiology and family practices via established relationships 
with physicians at Rhod e Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (e.g. Sam Dudley, MD), Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424665] (e.g. 
Charles Eaton, MD), Providence VA Medical Center (e.g. Hank Wu, MD), amongst others. Furthermore, 
advertisements will be posted throughout Rhode Island inviting participants w ith pre -hypertension or 
hypertension to enroll. For Aim 2, we anticipate n=60 participants with equal proportions of males and 
females, and stratified across prehypertension/hypertension categories, including (1) pre -hypertension, 
(2) controlled hypertension, and (3) uncontrolled hypertension. This will allow for early indications of 
potential differential effects of MBHT by [CONTACT_424887]/hypertension status. 
Inclusion Criterion: Hypertension/prehypertension (≥120 mmHg systolic, ≥80 mmHg diasto lic 
pressure or taking antihypertensive medication). All genders and racial/ethnic groups are eligible to be 
included.  
Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria follow standard guidelines and recommendations :1 (a) current 
regular meditation practice (>once/week); (b) serious medical illness precluding regular class 
attendance; (c) current substance abuse, suicidal ideation or eating disorder, (d) history of bipolar or 
psychotic disorders or self -injurious behaviors. These participants are excluded because they may 
disrupt group participation, require additional or specialized treatment, or are already participating in practices similar to the intervention. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_536832] protected, encrypted database on a different disk that 
the clinical data. Only the principal investig ator for the purposes of patient safety or monitoring by [CONTACT_137656], data safety monitoring boards or HIPPA compliance officer approved agents will be given access to 
identifiable personal information. 
Data which contains person -identifiers is considered highly sensitive.  Such data is, by [CONTACT_160572], only 
stored within the VMScluster at the Brown University Center for Population Health and Clinical Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623].  Access is controlled by [CONTACT_424890], allowing read -only access to a small 
group of specific  users and read -write access to an even smaller group.  Internet access (e.g., via a Web 
server) is disallowed for such storage areas.  Windows security controls are superceded by [CONTACT_424891], although Windows access is permitted since some data is acquir ed on Windows -specific media 
(e.g., CD -ROM).  All uses of privileged necessary to grant/revoke access to any data, as well as any 
other security -relevant event data, is continuously logged and analyzed in the context of both  the 
VMScluster and the Windows  Domain.  Network access is tightly controlled to allow anonymous access 
only to a small amount of read -only data; all “risky protocols” are disallowed from Internet access.  For 
any given study with person -identifying information, such data is stripped bef ore the data is made 
accessible to staff not authorized to access such identifiers.  In those cases where the data is longitudinal, a non -reversible encryption of the person ID is made in order to provide a unique person ID 
not traceable to the underlying person.  The specific algorithm used for any given set of data is stored in 
the same fashion and given the same security as the data itself.  To make data use simpler, hierarchical 
“trees” of directories are given consistent access controls tied to a uniqu e identifier, which is then granted 
to staff authorized to use such data.  Programming staff authorized to make individual -level data 
available to staff not authorized to access the person -identifying components routinely copy the 
“encrypted” versions from  the more -secured tree to a less- secured tree.  Security controls are thus 
relatively automatic, based on the propagation of rights based on the location of a file within the file system and the identity of the user attempting to access it.  
 
4.4 MBHT Intervention Groups 
High Dose:  MBHT is based on the standardized MBSR  intervention described elsewhere,17-[ADDRESS_536833] investigating associations of mindfulness with cardiovascular health.11,21,22 The 
unique areas of MBHT are expected to be education on hypertension risk factors, hypertension health 
effects, and specific mindfulness modules focused on awareness of diet, physical activity, medication adherence, alcohol consumption, stress, and social support for behavior change. A preliminary manual has been created based on  the standardized MBSR manual developed at UMass Medical School, and 
will be further developed through the Delphi -like approach described above, and sequentially revised 
based on participant feedback and preliminary findings .
19,20 MBHT sessions contain instruction and 
practice in mindfulness meditation, and conversations about stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Students learn a range of 
mindfulness skills including body sca n exercises, meditation and yoga. Homework consists o f practicing 
skills for ≥45 min/day, 6 days/week . Booster sessions will be offered  (likely 2.5 -hour sessions every 2 
months ).  
Low Dose:  Low Dose MBHT will be based on the High Dose intervention above, but instead 
prioritizing practices to fit within nine 1- hour weekly groups sessions. Through the aforemention ed 
Delphi -like approach, the most salient parts of the high dose interv ention described above will be offered 
in low dose MBHT.  
4.5 Measures of Compliance  
Participant Adherence:  Data on treatment protocol adherence will be collected weekly by [CONTACT_27329].  
MBHT  Instructor Competency and Treatment Fidelity: Treatment fidelity strategies will be performed 
in accordance with recommendations of the NIH Behavior Change consortium .23 
4.6 Blinding  
All study staff, including those  performing health assessments and contact[CONTACT_220379] t o 
schedule follow -up assessments , will be blinded to treatment alloc ation with the exception of the MBHT 
instructor (Loucks) and data manager (who performs randomization).  
4.7 Equipoise  
This study will be designed to disrupt clinical equipoise, defined as “no consensus within the expert 
clinical community about the comparative merits 
of the alternative [trial arms] to be tested .”[ADDRESS_536834]-intervention . Major 
assessment variables are shown in Table 1. 
Qualitative interviews (likely focus groups) will 
evaluate participants’ experiences such as usefulness of specific modules, duration of sessions, time burden, and overall intervention 
effectiveness.

Section D:  
Possible Risks to Participants 
 
    
 17 The fo llowing is a statement from NCCAM about the potential risks of meditation practice: “Meditation 
is considered to be safe for healthy people. There have been rare reports that meditation could cause or 
worsen symptoms in people who have certain psychiatric problems, but this question has not been fully 
researched. People with physical limitations may not be able to participate in certain meditative practices 
involving physical movement. Individuals with existing mental or physical health conditions should speak with their health care providers prior to starting a meditative practice and make their meditation instructor 
aware of their condition.”
285 
Discomfort during meditation:  Meditation -based interventions may results in discomfort with attention 
to unplea sant thoughts, feelings or body sensations. Some individuals may experience an initial increase 
in undesirable emotions with increased attention to them. In order to minimize risk, instructors encourage 
participants to be aware of their discomfort and to set their own limitations. Participants are encouraged to alter their postures, including standing, sitting in chairs, lying down, as needed in order to be 
comfortable. In addition, the curriculum of the training program is specifically geared towards addressing 
such discomfort.  
Psychological distress:  Research subjects participating in this study may have feelings of loss of 
privacy from being contact[CONTACT_424893], and possible psychological distress caused 
by [CONTACT_424894]. However, the 
resulting potential for injury to research subjects is judged to be minimal.  We have already contact[CONTACT_424895], with good responses from the participants. With regard to psychological distress from taking part in the MB HT intervention, given that screening questions will 
exclude participants with substantial mental il lness, and given the NCAAM statement above that 
“Meditation is considered to be safe for healthy people.”,
[ADDRESS_536840] that risk of psychological distress 
will be low. The risk of increased psychological distress from meditation will be clearly outlined in the 
consent form and participants will be encouraged to consult with both the course instructor and study staff in the case of any increased distress. One of the co -investigators ([CONTACT_425133] on) is a clinical 
psychologist. She will be available to advise on any psychological events that occur, and provide 
referrals for treatment if needed.  
Loss of confidentiality:  Likelihood: rare. Minimization: Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_412039], by [CONTACT_46767], and b y keepi[INVESTIGATOR_46741].   All 
information obtained from participants will be accessible only to research staff.  
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others : There may be no direct 
benefits from participating in this study. The potential benefits of participating in the proposed study 
include improved knowledge on stress reduction techniques and risk for hypertension.  Each participant 
will also be contributing to an important study which will answer questions on whether mindfulness- based 
stress reduction may influence health.   
  
 18  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
Section E:  
Informed Consent  
 
  
 19 Each potential participant will be fully informed about the nature of the study, its risks and benefits, 
and about his/her rights as a resear ch subject.  The person performing the consent will be either [CONTACT_425134] or a trained undergraduate trained research assistant. The participant will sign and receive a 
copy of the document stating that he/she has given his/her informed consent to participat e before 
interviewing is begun. In every instance, project personnel will verbally review the content of the consent 
form before participants sign.    
 
   
 [ADDRESS_536841] and met entrance criteria for having prehypertension or hypertension, or another cardiovascular risk f actor that could be 
influenced by [CONTACT_424896]. In order to assess the effects of these practices, you will be asked to 
complete some questionnaires, and a laboratory assessment before and after learning the mindfulness 
practices.  
 
1b.   Explanation of Pro cedures   
 
If you agree to participate, you will be asked to consent to the following:  
 
1) Participate in an interview in which you will be asked questions about past and present mental health, 
including depression and suicide.  
 
2) Complete questionnaires about  a wide range of topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], including your diet, physical activity, smoking, 
medication use, personality, emotions, attention and past experiences, including stressful or traumatic experiences. These questions will probe sensitive psychological areas, includi ng physical, 
emotion and sexual abuse. These questionnaires may take up to [ADDRESS_536842] the right not to a nswer any of the questions.  
 
3) Directly assessed blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference and hip circumference.  
 
4) You will be asked to perform some cognitive tasks. One of these tasks may involve computer -based 
tests of attention or decision -making. Together these tests may take as long as 45 minutes.  
 
5) You will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to enter one of two 9 week meditation 
programs.  
 
6) You will participate in the 9-week medi tation program, which consists of [ADDRESS_536843] of  practicing mindfulness exercises with the aid of a guided audio CD 
and completing worksheets related to stress, thoughts,  and common reactions to various types of 
events.  
 
 21 7) Class sessions will be audio taped so we can analyze the quality of the treatment you receive. The 
recordings will be transcribed so that we may analyze the text. The recordings will be identified by 
[CONTACT_5056], will only be heard by [CONTACT_424897].  
 
8) You will be asked to complete a few short questionnaires each week during the [ADDRESS_536844].  
 
9) After 9 weeks, you will be asked to complete a second packet of questionnaires and return to the 
laboratory to repeat the same procedures for a second day of testing.  
 
10) Three months  and six months after the end of the 9 week condition, you will be asked to return t o the 
laboratory to repeat the same testing procedures.  
 
Feedback:  
At the end of the study, you will receive individual feedback about the changes that occurred since the 
first assessment. Specifically, you will receive an individualized handout listing % change (increase or 
decrease) on scales of attention, stress, mood, health behaviors and blood pressure across the study.  
 2.  Discomforts and Risks  
The questionnaires are routine, standardized forms for epi[INVESTIGATOR_20851].  Certain questions may be upsetting as they may probe sensitive psychological areas and inquire about upsetting or traumatic events, including physical, sexual or emotional abuse and/or current psychiatric symptoms.  Since your 
participation is voluntary, you have the right to skip any questions that make you uncomfortable.  
 
Meditation -based interventions may results in discomfort with attention to unpleasant thoughts, feelings 
or body sensations. Some individuals may experience an initial increase in undesirable feelings with 
increa sed attention to them.  
 
3.  Benefits  
We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any direct benefits from this study.  
However, participation in the study creates the potential benefit of a) identifying effective treatments for 
elevated blood pressure, b) gaining knowledge of the effects of mindfulness practices, c) gaining first -
hand knowledge about the most current scientific methods in scientific research d) receiving information 
about your psychological and physical functioning.  
 
4.  Alternative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
A number of different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including antihypertensive medication, diet changes, physical activity, and reducing excessive alcohol consumption may also be beneficial for reducing blood pressure. Education about these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424667], but other forms of these alternative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424668].  
 5.  Confidentiality   
Your responses for this study will be kept confidential.  All data that we collect will be linked to a study 
ID# inst ead of your name.  All questionnaires in this study will be filled out through an online survey 
website (SurveyMonkey).  All of these questionnaires will be linked solely to your study ID#, so that your 
identity is protected and your answers are confidenti al.  Although these measures have been taken to 
protect your personal information, complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed when transmitting information over the internet.  
 
While your confidentiality is protected to the extent of the law, there are l imitations to confidentiality. If 
your questionnaire responses indicate that you pose a serious danger to yourself or to another person, 
then the PI, or a co -investigator (Willoughby [CONTACT_359039]) who is a clinical psychologist, may contact [CONTACT_424898] 
 [ADDRESS_536845] of children to the Department  of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF).   State law also requires researchers to report 
abuse or neglect of people age [ADDRESS_536846] that 
you cannot be identified. All personally identifiable information will be "de -identified" and only a unique 
code number will be used. Study records will be identified with a unique code number and initials. All 
study records and specimens will be stored in a secure storage area.  
Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_72058] : The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_424669].   
 
6.  Refusal/Withdrawal  
Participation is voluntary, and you may decide to opt out or refuse any part of participation, including not 
answering certain questions. If you decide now to participate, you can change your mind later and quit 
the study.  The decision to not participate or to withdraw from the study will not adversely affect current

[Date]  
 
Dear _____,  
 
Your physician [name [CONTACT_425105]] identified you as someone with p rehypertension or hypertension who 
may be interested in participating in a new study at Brown University that is desi gned to evaluate effects 
of an intervention called Mindfulness- Based Hypertension Therapy (MBHT). MBHT combines 
mindfulness practices such as meditation and mindful movements with education about hypertension 
management and prevention . The aim of MBHT is to create a skill set and supportive environment to 
help to reduce blood pressure, and improve overall well -being. Your involvement in this study could help 
us better understand if MBHT is effective, and how it could be improved . The MBHT intervention will  take 
place over [ADDRESS_536849] benefits from this study.  
However, participation in the study creates the potential benefit of a) identifying effective treatments for 
elevated blood pressure, b) gaining knowledge of the effects of mindfulness practices, c) gaining first -
hand knowledge about the most current scientific methods in scientific research d) receiving information 
about your psychological and physical functioning.  
 
If you are interested in participating in this stu dy, please call 401- 863-6283, or email

fruit or vegetables that were part of another dish, like a banana on cereal or vegetables in a stew. Also,

1. Please ensure the study documents are consistent throughout the entire protocol submission. 
The Board noted that the prot ocol, recruitment material, consent document, surveys, and focus 
group documents contained conflicting information, did not match each other, and referenced 
sections and procedures that were not included in other documents in the submission.  
RESPONSE:  Than k you, we apologize for the inconsistencies. Documents should now be consistent 
throughout.  
2. Please provide further description of the recruitment and consenting processes. The Board 
noted that the protocol contained too few details about these parts of th e study.  
RESPONSE: Please see increased information below.  
APPLICATION CHANGE (pg. 15):  
Participants will be recruited through cardiology and family practices via established relationships 
with physicians at Rhode Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (e.g. Sam Dudley, MD), Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424665] 
(e.g. Charles Eaton, MD), Providence VA Medical Center (e.g. Hank Wu, MD), amongst others. IRB approval will be obtained by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_424689], such as Rhode Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424690]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], invitation letters (example text shown in Section F) will be sent to 96  
eligible patients in each collaborative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Patient eligibility will be based on medical records of blood pressure and gender. Participants will be recruited in equal numbers based on hypertension status (i.e. pre-hypertensive, controlled hypertensive, and uncontrolled hypertensive), with equal proportions being male and female when possible. This approach will provide important recruitment and participation rate data for future studies. Furthermore, advertisements will be posted throughout Rhode Island inviting pa rticipants with pre -hypertension or hypertension to enroll (example 
advertisement shown in Section F).  
3. Please clarify how many participants you intend to enroll in the study. The Board was unsure if 
you would enroll the first [ADDRESS_536888] also questioned how the 60 
participants would be stratified across the three prehypertension/hypertension categories 
described in the protocol.  
RESPONSE : This has now been clarified. Please see change below.  
APPLICATION CHANGE (pg. 15):  
For Aims 1 -3, we anticipate n=60 participants with equal proportions of males and females, and 
stratified across prehypertension/hypertension categories, including (1) pre-hypertension, (2) controlled hypertension, and (3) uncontrolled hypertension. This will allow for early indications of potential differential effects of MBHT by [CONTACT_424887]/hypertension status. Likely substantially greater than [ADDRESS_536889] performed by [CONTACT_162829].
1 Specifically, Hughes et al.  showed, with mean baseline SBP of 
129.5 (6.3 SD) mmHg and DBP of 77.8 (5.5 SD) mmHg, at 8 weeks follow-up a net reduction of 4.2 mmHg SBP and 3.1 mmHg DBP for MBSR vs. active control group.
1 For a sample size of 35 
participants per group, power analyses show 80% and 90% power to detect differences of 4.3 and 4.9 mmHg SBP, respectively. This suggests adequate power for main effects analyses. At this time, Aim 4 anticipates 70 participants in the study (35 per treatment arm), of which we expect approximately 140 participants will need to be screened.  
4. Please further clarify when, where, and how participants will be asked to complete the screening 
and baseline surveys.  
RESPONSE: This information has now been clarified in Part 3.7.5 of Section C, as w ell as changes 
throughout Section G.

3.7.5  Timing and Locations of Assessments 
Phone-Based Screening: For people who indicate interest in the study, this screening will take 
place by [CONTACT_424910] (see Section 
G for questions): (a) current regular meditation practice (>once/week); (b) serious medical illness 
precluding regular class attendance; (c) current substance abuse, suicidal ideation or eating disorder, (d) history of bipolar or psychotic disorders or self-injurious behaviors. These participants are excluded because they may disrupt group participation, require additional or specialized treatment, or are already participating in practices similar to the intervention.  
In-Person Screening:  If participants remain eligible after the phone- based screening, they will 
attend an in -person screening for blood pressure and medication assessment. If mean blood pressure 
shows hypertension/prehypertension (≥120 mmHg systolic, ≥80 mmHg diastolic pressure or taking antihypertensive medica tion), participants will be invited to return for a second blood pressure 
reading. At that time, if the mean blood pressure across both assessment times is ≥120 mmHg systolic, ≥80 mmHg diastolic pressure, or the participants is taking antihypertensive medi cation, they will be 
invited to participant in the study.  
Baseline Assessments Completed at Home:  Questions about demographics, health behaviors, self 
control, depressive symptomatology, anxiety symptoms, mindfulness, sleep, childhood experiences, 
 [ADDRESS_536890] others will be assessed via internet -based Survey Monkey or via paper- based forms. Please 
see Section G for the questionnaires.  
Follow-Up Assessments at 8 Weeks and 3 Months Follow-Up: Identical assessments will take 
place at 8 weeks and 3 months follow-up, as done with the screening and baseline assessments 
described above.  
Focus Groups:  Focus group assessments of participants will take place following the final week of 
class. Descriptions of focus group topi[INVESTIGATOR_424691] G.   
5. Please clarify whether the data collected from the screening survey will be destroyed after 
eligibility is determined, since participants will not go through a consent process before 
completing this survey.

data.   
7. Please describe your and your undergraduate students' training and qualifications related to 
conducting the psychological assessments of the phone screen survey.  
RESPONSE:  
 
I am a social epi[INVESTIGATOR_424692]. I received training at the 
University of [LOCATION_005] Medical School on baseline assessment of participants prior to 
undergoing Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction. Similar questions are asked and discussed with 
 [ADDRESS_536892]. Willoughby [CONTACT_359039], who has screening questions identical or similar to these 
assessed in her Brown University Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy study entitled: "Dismantling 
Mindfulness: Contributions of attention vs. acceptance" (#[PHONE_8827]).” She will be available for 
questions that arise in the context of this survey. Student i nterviewer training includes high standards 
for selection of interviewers who are at ease with strangers, are culturally -sensitive  and able to readily 
establish professional rapport. Interviewers will be thoroughly trained in the administration of the 
structured interview, including the screening questionnaire. A Safety Plan has been developed, which 
will provide structure in cases of participants indicating mental distress, particularly related to suicidal 
ideation.

9. Please identify how data collected from Survey Monkey during the baseline survey will be 
linked to participants, and how participant e -mail addresses will not be linked with their data.  
RESPONSE: For online questionnaires, participants will be provided with a weblink to the survey. 
Upon going to the weblink, they will enter the survey. First, participants will be asked to enter their 
study ID #. There will be no opportunities for participants to enter their names, personal addresses or email addresses into the SurveyMonkey data collection forms. Data will then be downloaded and stored within the secure VMScluster at the Brown  University Center for Population Health and 
Clinical Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]. If participants prefer, they will be provided with a paper copy of the questionnaire that can be filled out. Study staff will then manually enter the responses, and the data will be stored  on the VMScluster.  
10. The Board was unsure  if the computer is the most effective data collection method for the types 
of questions in the baseline survey (for example, the lengthy "Medications" section).  Please 
provide a rationale for why this survey should be completed by [CONTACT_22123].  
RESPONSE: Thank you for pointing this out. The medications will be assessed in-person during the 
first screening assessment, as blood pressure medication use is one of the screening criteria. 
Medications will also be assessed dur ing the in -person assessments at 9 weeks and 3 months follow-
up. Please see Part 3.7.5 in Section C, as well as Section G, for more details.

Lay-Person Summary of Proposed Project  
  
 10 The World Health Organization reported that suboptimal blood pressure (BP) is responsible for more 
than half of cardiovascular disease mortality world -wide . Furthermore, greater than half of those with 
hypertension have uncontrolled BP. A 2009 Institute of Medicine report recommended prioritizing 
research to “Compare the effectiveness of mindfulness -based interventions (e.g. yoga, meditation, deep 
breathing training) and usual care in treating… cardiovascular risk factors.”   Evidence- based 
mindfulness interventions, including Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction, may have some effects on 
blood pressure, where a recent meta -analysis and systematic review of [ADDRESS_536894] sizes (range 0 -5 mmHg). Mindfulness- Based Stress 
Reduction (MBSR) has been customized to a number of disease processes, such as Mindfulness- Based 
Cognitive Therapy for patients with recurrent depression, and Mindfulness- Based Relapse Prevention for 
patients with substance use addictions. Effect sizes have been increased by [CONTACT_424913]. The sa me may be true for hypertension , however mindfulness 
interventions customized for prehypertensive/hypertensive patients have never been investigated . Until 
methodologically rigorous studies to evaluate customized interventions for hypertension are performed, 
we will not know if the observed preliminary effec ts of general mindfulness interventions on blood 
pressure reduction could be much more effective with a t ailored approach.  Consequently, we propose to 
conduct a stage I behavioral therapy intervention study to evaluate  whether MBSR customized to 
prehypertensive and hypertensive patients has the potential to provide clinically relevant reductions in BP. 
Consequently the specific aims are:  
 Stage 1a: Therapy Development/Manual Writing 1 To outline and evaluate key novel elements of mindfulness-based hypertension therapy (MBHT), customized from the evidence- based MBSR. We hypothesize that the most important novel element 
will be generation of mindfulness skills  specifically  applied to hypertension risk factors such as diet, 
physical activity, obesity, alcohol consumption and antihypertensive medication adherence. This aim will be achieved using (1) focus groups of participants undergoing the MBHT behavioral intervention, (2) discussion with experts (including cardiologists, epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543], mindfulness experts, mindfulness intervention instructors) prior to, and following pi[INVESTIGATOR_424693], and (3) clinical judgment of the investigators performing the intervention.  
2 To determine effectiveness of MBHT on primary outcomes (systolic blood pressure, retention rates, recruitment rates, and adverse effects) and secondary outcomes (hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical activity, obesity, and antihypertensive medication  adherence) in hypertension subgroups, 
specifically participants with (1) prehypertension, (2) controlled hypertension, and (3) uncontrolled hypertension. Initial decisions about the targeted sample based on hypertension status will be made.

 Stage Ib: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] 4 To determine whether a m indfulness-based hypertension therapy (MBHT) intervention, customized 
from the evidence- based MBSR, has promise to be an effective behavioral therapy for participants 
with hypertension and/or prehypertension. We will perform a randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] t rial for 
MBHT vs. enhanced usual care control. We hypothesize that MBHT will have  adequate recruitment 
rates (≥10% of prehypertensive/hypertensive participants invited from physicians’ offices), fairly low 
 11 drop out rates (<15%), and medium effect sizes (e.g. 5-10 mmHg systolic BP) for reduction in blood 
pressure.  
These findings will provide publishable pi[INVESTIGATOR_424694]-term changes in blood pressure vs. usual care and active control 
groups. If proven effective, MBHT could be offered as a complementary program in the 
prehypertensive/hypertensive patient population that contributes to over half of the cardiovascular 
disease mortality world -wide.

3.1 Study Population (Aim 2) 
Participants will be recruited through cardiology and family practices via established relationships 
with physicians at Rhode Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (e.g. Sam Dudley, MD), Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424665] 
(e.g. Charles Eaton, MD), Providence VA Medical Center (e.g. Hank Wu, MD), amongst others. IRB 
approval will be obtained by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_424689], such as Rhode Island Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424698]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], invitation letters  (example text shown in Section F) will b e sent to 96 eligible 
patients in each collaborative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Patient eligibility will be based on medical records  of blood 
pressure  and gender . Participants will be recruited in equal numbers based on hypertension status (i.e. pre-
hypertensive, controlle d hypertensive, and uncontrolled hypertensive), with equal proportions being male 
and female when possible. This approach will provide important recruitment and participation rate data 
for future studies. Furthermore, advertisements will be posted throughout Rhode Island inviting 
participants with pre -hypertension or hypertension to enroll (example adver tisement shown in Section F).  
For Aims 1 -3, we anticipate n=60 participants with equal proportions of males and females, and 
stratified across prehypertension/hypertension categories, including (1) pre-hypertension, (2) controlled 
hypertension, and (3) uncontrolled hypertension. This will allow for early indications of potential 
differential effects of  MBHT by [CONTACT_424887]/hypertension status. Likely substantially 
greater than [ADDRESS_536900] performed by [CONTACT_162829].1 Specifically, 
Hughes et al.  showed, with mean baseline SBP of 129.5 (6.3 SD) mmHg and DBP of 77.8 (5.5 SD) 
mmHg, at 8 weeks follow -up a net reduction of 4.2 mmHg SBP and 3.1 mmHg DBP for MBSR vs. active 
control group.1 For a sample size of 35 participants per group, power analyses show 80% and 90% power 
to detect differences of 4.3 and 4.9 mmHg SBP, respectively. This suggests adequate power for main 
effects analyses. At this time, Aim 4 anticipates 70 participants in the study (35 per treatment arm), of 
which we expect approximately 140 participants will need to be screened.   
Inclusion Criterion: Hypertension/prehypertension (≥120 mmHg systolic, ≥80 mmHg diastolic 
pressure or taking antihypertensive medication). All genders and racial/ethnic groups are eligible to be 
included.  
Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria follow standard guidelines and recommendations:17 (a) current 
regular meditation practice (>once/week); (b) serious medical illness precluding regular class attendance; 
(c) current substance abuse, suicidal ideation or eating disorder, (d) history of bipolar or psychotic 
 [ADDRESS_536901] protected, encrypted database on a different disk that 
the clinical data. Only the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_424699], data safety monitoring boards or HIPPA compliance officer approved agents will be given access to identifiable personal information.  
Data which contains person- identifiers is considered highly sensitive. Such data is, by [CONTACT_160572], only 
stored within the VMScluster at the Brown University Center for Population Hea lth and Clinical 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]. Access is controlled by [CONTACT_424890], allowing read -only access to a small 
group of specific users and read- write access to an even smaller group.  Internet access (e.g., via a Web 
server) is disallowed for such storage areas.  Windows security controls are superceded by [CONTACT_424891], although Windows access is permitted since some data is acquired on Windows- specific media (e.g., CD -
ROM). All uses of privileged necessary to grant/revoke access to any data, as well as  any other security -
relevant event data, is continuously logged and analyzed in the context of both the VMScluster and the Windows Domain.  Network access is tightly controlled to allow anonymous access only to a small amount of read- only data; all “risky protocols” are disallowed from Internet access.  For any given study 
with person-identifying information, such data is stripped before the data is made accessible to staff not authori zed to access such identifiers.  In those cases where the data is longitudinal, a non- reversible 
encryption of the person ID is made in order to provide a unique person ID not traceable to the underlying person. The specific algorithm used for any given set of data is stored in the same fashion and given the same security as the data itself. To make data use simpler, hierarchical “trees” of directories are given 
consistent access controls tied to a unique identifier, which is then granted to staff authorized to use such data.  Programming staff authorized to make individual- level data available to staff not authorized to 
access the person -identifying components routinely copy the “encrypted” versions from the more- secured 
tree to a less -secured tree. Security controls are thus relatively automatic, based on the propagation of 
right s based on the location of a file within the file system and the identity of the user attempting to access 
it. 
For online questionnaires, participants will be provided with a weblink to the survey. Upon going to 
the weblink, they will enter the survey. First, participants will be asked to enter their study ID #. There 
will be no opportunities for participants to enter their names, personal addresses or email addresses into 
the SurveyMonkey data collection forms. Data will then be downloaded and stored withi n the secure 
VMScluster at the Brown University Center for Population Health and Clinical Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]. If 
participants prefer, they will be provided with a paper copy of the questionnaire that can be filled out. 
Study staff will then manually enter the re sponses, and the data will be stored on the VMScluster.

unique areas of MBHT are expected to be education on hypertension risk factors, hypertension health effects, and specific mindfulness modules focused on awareness of diet, physical activity, medication adherence, alcohol consumption, stress, and social support for behavior change. A preliminary manual has 
 17 been created based on the standardized MBSR manual developed at UMass Medical School, and will be 
further developed through the Delphi-like approach described above, and sequentially revised based on participant feedback and preliminary findings.
20,21 MBHT sessions contain instruction and practice in 
mindfulness meditation, and conversations about stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Students learn a range of mindfulness skills including body sca n exercises, meditation  and yoga. Homework consists of practicing skills for ≥45 
min/day, 6 days/week. Booster sessions will be offered (likely 2.5-hour sessions every 2  months).  
MBSR Active Control Group: MBSR will consist of nine 2.5-hour weekly group sessions and an 8-
hour one-day session, led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Eric Loucks, who is has completed MBSR instructor training at UMass Medical School .
18,19 MBSR  sessions contain instruction and practice in mindfulness meditation, and 
conversations about stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Students learn a range of mindfulness skills including body scan exercises, meditation  and yoga. Homework consists o f practicing skills for ≥45 min/day, 6 days/week. 
Booster sessions will be offered (likely 2.5-hour sessions every 2 months).  
3.4 Measures of Compliance 
Participant Adherence:  Data on treatment protocol adherence will be collected weekly by [CONTACT_27329].  
MBHT  Instructor Competency and Treatment Fidelity: Treatment fidelity strategies will be performed 
in accordance with recommendations of the NIH Behavior Change consortium .24 
3.5 Blinding 
All study staff, including those performing health assessments  and contact[CONTACT_424914]-up assessments, will be blinded to treatment alloc ation with the exception of the MBHT /MBSR  
instructor (Loucks) and data manager (who performs randomization).  
3.6 Equipoise 
This study will be designed to disrupt clinical equipoise, defined as “no consensus withi n the expert 
clinical community about the comparative merits of the alternative [trial arms] to be tested .”[ADDRESS_536903]-intervention. M ajor assessment 
variables are shown in Table 1. Qualitative 
interviews ( focus groups) will evaluate 
participants’ experiences such as usefulness of specific modules, duration of sessions, time burden, and overall intervention effectiveness. Interviewer training includes high standards for 
selection of interviewers who are at ease with 
strangers,  are culturally -sensitive and able to 
readily establish professional rapport. 
Interviewers will be thoroughly trained in the 
administration of the structured interview, 
anthropometry, and blood pressure assessments.  
Routine quality control procedures will be in 
 [ADDRESS_536904] monthly to evaluate accuracy of technique, particularly for anthropometry and 
blood pressure assessment. Re- training will be implemented if needed . Data will be entered and cleaned 
in an ongoing matter to facilitate quality control and preliminary analyses.  
3.7.1 Primary Outcomes  
Clinic BP Assessment: Clinic-assessed systolic and diastolic BP remains the standard of care for 
monitoring hypertension treatment.4,6,7,26,27  Baseline clinic BP will be determined at two in -person 
screening visits ≥1 week apart, completed according to American Heart Association guidelines,26  
followed by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]- person assessments at all follow -up periods . BP will be assessed using a calibrated Omron 
HEM907XL Intellisense automa ted BP monitor with established validity.28  
3.7.2 Potential Mediators  
Examples of mediators to be assessed include: ( 1) Body Mass Index: height and weight directly 
assessed using  standard epi[INVESTIGATOR_19185]. (2) Physical activity : MET minutes per week, assessed 
using actigraphy, which enables the   qua ntification of physical activity.29-33  (3) Diet : diet assessed 
utilizing D ietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern score,34 measured via diet 
history food frequency questionnaire.35 (4) Perceived stress:  measured using Perceived Stress Scale.36 (5) 
Antihypertensive Medication Use : recorded  by [CONTACT_424915].  
3.7.[ADDRESS_536905] modifiers: (1) gender, (2) 
prehypertension/hypertension category. 
3.7.4 Qualitative Assessments 
Following completion of the MBHT intervention, participants will be asked to particip ate in a focus 
group discussion outlined in Box 1, shown below. The goal of the focus groups will be to adapt  MBHT  to 
the unique needs of this population. Adaptions may include, for example, types of specific mindfulness 
exercises, sequence in which they are introduced, and relative emphasis on hypertension education vs.  
mindfulness practice components. 
3.7.5 Timing and Locations of Assessments  
Phone-Based Screening: For people who indicate interest in the study, this screening will take place 
by [CONTACT_424911] (see Section G for 
questions): (a) current regular meditation practice (>once/week); (b) serious medical illness precluding 
regular class attendance; (c) current s ubstance abuse, suicidal ideation or eating disorder, (d) history of 
bipolar or psychotic disorders or self-injurious behaviors. These participants are excluded because they 
may disrupt group participation, require additional or specialized treatment, or a re already participating in 
practices similar to the intervention.  For participants excluded from the study at this stage, data will be 
destroyed, as participants will not have gone through a consent process prior to completing this survey.  
In-Person Screening:  If participants remain eligible after the phone -based screening, they will attend 
an in -person screening for blood pressure and medication assessment. If mean blood pressure shows 
hypertension/prehypertension (≥120 mmHg systolic, ≥80 mmHg diastolic pressure or taking 
antihypertensive medication), participants will be invited to return for a second blood pressure reading. At 
that time, if the mean blood pressure across both assessment times is ≥120 mmHg systolic, ≥[ADDRESS_536906] gone through a consent process prior to completing this survey. 
Baseline Assessments Completed at H ome:  Questions about demographics, health behaviors , self 
control, depressive symptomatology, anxiety symptoms, mindfulness, sleep, childhood experiences, 
 [ADDRESS_536907] others will be assessed via internet -based Survey Monkey or via paper- based forms. Please see 
Section G for the questionnaires.  
Follow- Up Assessments at 8 Weeks and 3 Months Follow-Up: Identical assessments will take place at 
8 week s and 3 months follow-up, as done with the screening and basel ine assessments described above, 
with the exception that questionnaires for which the answers should not change or be informative (i.e. 
introductory questions, age, race/ethnicity, education, childhood experiences) are not given at follow-ups.   
Focus Groups:  Focus group assessments of participa nts will take place following the final week of 
class. Descriptions of focus group topi[INVESTIGATOR_424691] G.   
 
3.8 Intervention Allocation 
Stratified randomization will be 
used.37,38 Variables used to create 
strata include gender (male vs. 
female), race/ethnicity (white vs. 
non-white), and prehypertension/ 
hypertension status (pre -
hypertension, controlled hypertension, uncontrolled hypertension). Simple random sampling will occur within each strata.   
3.9 Data Analysis 
Qualitative analyses will 
evaluate participant experiences such as usefulness of specific modules, duration of sessions, time burden, and overall intervention effectiveness. Quantitative analyses will incorporate generalized linear models (GLM) 
with properly chosen link functions, performed  using 
generalized estimating equations 
(GEE) with robust standard error 
estimators.

Section D:  
Possible Risks to Participants  
 
    
 21 The following is a statement from NCCAM about the potential risks of meditation practice: 
“Meditation is considered to be safe for healthy people. There have been rare reports that meditation 
could cause or worsen symptoms in people who have certain psychiatric problems, but this question has not been fully researched. People with physical limitations may not be able to participate in certain meditative practices involving physical movement. Individuals with existing mental or physical health conditions shoul d speak with their health care providers prior to starting a meditative practice and make 
their meditation instructor aware of their condition.”
41 
Discomfort during meditation:  Meditation -based interventions may results in discomfort with 
attention to unpleasant thoughts, feelings or body sensations. Some individuals may experience an initial increase in undesirable emotions with increased attention to them. In order to minimize risk, instructors encourage participants to be aware of their discomfort and to set their own limitations. Participants are encouraged to alter their postures, including standing, sitting in chairs, lying down, as needed in order to be comfortable. In addition, the curriculum of the training program is specifically geared towards addressing such discomfort.  
Psychological distress:  Research subjects participating in this study may have feelings of loss of 
privacy from being contact[CONTACT_424893], and possible psychological distress caused by [CONTACT_424894]. However, the resulting potential for injury to research subjects is judged to be minimal.  We have already contact[CONTACT_424916], with good responses from the participants. With regard to psychological distress from taking part in the MB HT intervention, given that screening questions will exclude participants with 
substantial mental illness, and given the NCAAM statement above that “Meditation is considered to be 
safe for healthy people.”,
[ADDRESS_536910] that risk of psychological distress will be low. The risk of increased 
psychological distress from meditation will be clearly outlined in the consent form and participants will be encouraged to consult with both the course instructor and study staff in the case of any increased distress. One of the co-investigators ([CONTACT_425138]) is a clinical psych ologist. She will be available to advise 
on any psychological events that occur, and provide referrals for treatment if needed.  
Loss of confidentiality:  Likelihood: rare. Minimization: Confidentiality will be maintained by 
[CONTACT_46766], by [CONTACT_46767], and by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_424701].   All information obtained from participants will be accessible only to research staff. 
The clinical data will be de -identified but linked. For electronic data, private information such as name, 
date of birth, and address for recontact[CONTACT_424917] a password protected, encrypted database on a different disk than the clinical data. Only the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_424699], data safety monitoring boards or HIPPA compliance officer approved agents will be given access to identifiable personal information. 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others : There may be no direct 
benefits f rom participating in this study. The potential benefits of participating in the proposed study 
include improved knowledge on stress reduction techniques and risk for hypertension .  Each participant 
will also be contributing to an important study which will answer questions on whether mindfulness-based stress reduction may influence health.   
  
 22  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
Section E:  
Informed Consent  
 
  
 23 Each potential participant will be fully informed about the nature of the study, its risks and benefits, 
and about his/her rights as a research subject.  The person performing the consent will be either [CONTACT_425134] or a trained undergraduate trained research assistant. The participant will sign and receive a copy 
of the document stating that he/she has given his/her informed consent to participate before interviewing is begun. In every instance, project personnel will verbally review the content of the consent form before participants sign.    
 
   
 [ADDRESS_536911] and met entrance criteria for having prehypertension or hypertension, or another cardiovascular risk factor that could be influenced by [CONTACT_424896]. In order to assess the effects of these practices, you will be asked to complete some questionnaires, and a laboratory assessment before and after learning the mindfulness practices. 
 
1b.   Explanation of Procedures   
 
If you agree to participate, you will be asked to consent to the following:  
 1) Participate in an interview in which you will be asked questions about past and present mental health, 
including depression and suicide. 
 
2) Complete questionnaires about a wide range of topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], including your diet, physical activity, smoking, medication use, personality, emotions, attention and past experiences, including stressful or traumatic experiences. These questions will probe sensitive psychological areas, including physical, emotion and sexual abuse. These questionnaires may take up to [ADDRESS_536912] the right not to answer any of the questions.  
 
3) Directly assessed blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference and hip circumference.  
 
4) You will be asked to perform some cognitive tasks. One of these tasks may involve computer- based 
tests of attention or decision- making. Together these tests may take as long as 45 minutes.  
 
5) You will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to enter one of two 8- week  meditation 
programs. 
 
6) You will participate in the 8-week  medi tation program, which consists of [ADDRESS_536913] of practicing mindfulness exercises with the aid of a guided audio CD and 
complet ing worksheets related to stress, thoughts, and common reactions to various types of events. 
 
 25 7) Class sessions will be audio taped so we can analyze the quality of the treatment you receive. The 
recordings will be transcribed so that we may analyze the text.  The recordings will be identified by 
[CONTACT_5056], will only be heard by [CONTACT_424897].  
 
8) You will be asked to complete a few short questionnaires each week during the 8 week  condition. 
 9) After 8 week s, you will be asked to complete questionnaires and return to the laboratory to repeat the 
same procedures for a second day of testing. 
 
10) Three months  after the end of the 8 week  condition, you will be asked to return to the laboratory to 
repeat the same testing procedures.  
 
Feedback:  
At the end of the study, you will receive individual feedback about the changes that occurred since the first assessment. Specifically, you will rec eive an individualized handout listing % change (increase or 
decrease) on scales of attention, stress, mood, health behaviors and blood pressure across the study.  
2.  Discomforts and Risks 
The questionnaires are routine, standardized forms for epi[INVESTIGATOR_424702].  Certain questions may be 
upsetting as they may probe sensitive psychological areas and inquire about upsetting or traumatic events, including physical, sexual or emotional abuse and/or current psychiatric symptoms.  Since your participation is voluntary, you have the right to skip any questions that make you uncomfortable.  
Meditation -based interventions may results in discomfort with attention to unpleasant thoughts, feelings 
or body sensations. Some individuals may experience an initial incr ease in undesirable feelings with 
increased attention to them.  
 
3.  Benefits  
We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any direct benefits from this study.  
However, participation in the study creates the potential benefit of a) ident ifying effective treatments for 
elevated blood pressure, b) gaining knowledge of the effects of mindfulness practices, c ) receiving 
information about your psychological and physical functioning.  
4.  Alternative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
A number of different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including antihypertensive medication, diet changes, physical activity, and reducing excessive alcohol consumption may also be beneficial for reducing blood pressure. Education about these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424667], but other forms of these alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424668].  
 
5.  Confidentiality   
Your responses for this study will be kept confidential.  All data that we collect will be linked to a study ID# instead of your name.  All questionnaires in this study will be filled out through an online survey website (SurveyMonkey)  or a paper version of the survey if you prefer .  All of these questionnaires will 
be linked solely to your study ID#, so that your identity is protected and your answers are confidential.  Altho ugh these measures have been taken to protect your personal information, complete confidentiality 
cannot be guaranteed when transmitting information over the internet.  While your confidentiality is protected to the extent of the law, there are limitations  to confidentiality. If 
your questionnaire responses indicate that you pose a serious danger to yourself or to another person, then 
 26 a collaborator [provide name] who is a licensed psychiatrist, may contact [CONTACT_424918] l to a  treatment provider. Questionnaire items that may warrant follow -up include 
endorsements of statements about hurting yourself, any high scores in depression, anxiety, or other 
clinically significant problems. You should also know that there are times when the law might require the release of your responses without your permission.  For example, State law requires researchers to report abuse or neglect of children to the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF).   State law also requires resea rchers to report abuse or neglect of people age [ADDRESS_536914] that you cannot be identified. All personally identifiable information will be "de -identified" and only a unique 
code number will be used. Study records will be identified with a unique code number and initials. All study records and specimens will be stored in a secure storage area.

Sample Text of Recruitment Letter (placed on [CONTACT_425135]’ letterhead):  
 
[Date]  
 Dear _____,   Your physician [name [CONTACT_425105]] identified you as someone with prehypertension or hypertension who may be interested in participating in a new study at Brown University that is designed to evaluate effects of an intervention called Mindfulness-Based Hypertension Therapy (MBHT). MBHT combines mindfulness practices such as meditation and mindful movements with education about hypertension 
management and prevention. The aim of MBHT is to create a skill set and supportive environment to  help 
to reduce blood pressure, and improve overall well-being. Your involvement in this study could help us better understand if MBHT is effective, and how it could be improved. The MBHT intervention will take place over [ADDRESS_536916] benefits from this study.  However, participation in the study creates the potential benefit of a) identifying effective treatments for elevated blood pressure, b) gaining knowledge of the effects of mindfulness practices, c) gaining first-hand knowledge about the most current scientific methods in scientific research d) receiving information about your psychological and physical functioning.  If you are interested in participating in this stu dy, please call [PHONE_8825], or email 
[EMAIL_8109].  Sincerely yours,

Safety Plan  
  
SAFETY PLAN  
 
If a participant’s interview or questionnaire responses indicate that he/she poses a serious 
danger to him/herself or to another person, then the safety plan described below will be triggered into effect.  
1 HOW QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE RISK  
1.1 Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI )  
 
The BAI was designed to measure clinical anxiety in a way that minimizes the overlap between 
depression and anxiety.1 A BAI score of 26 -63 represents severe anxiety.1 Questionnaires will 
be reviewed within one week  of completion. If participants score ≥[ADDRESS_536917] within 24 hours to determine need for a psychological consultat ion.  
1.2 Centers for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_424705] (CES D-R) Scale  
 
The 20 items in CESD -R scale measure symptoms of depression in nine different groups as 
defined by [CONTACT_424921], fourth 
edition.2 These symptom groups are shown below, with their associated scale question 
numbers.  
1. Sadness  (dysphoria): Question numbers 2,4, [ADDRESS_536918]  (anhedonia): Question numbers 8, 10  
3. Appetite:  Question numbers 1, 18  
4. Sleep:  Question numbers 5, 11, 19  
5. Thinking / concentration:  Question numbers 3, 20  
6. Guilt (worthlessness): Question numbers 9, 17  
7. Tired  (fatigue): Question numbers 7, 16  
8. Movement  (agitation): Question numbers 12, 13  
9. Suicidal ideation:  Question numbers 14, [ADDRESS_536919] within 24 hours to 
determine need for a psychological consultation.  
 
If participants respond having any suicidal ideation (CESD -R questions  14 or 15), this will trigger 
the safety plan where our collaborating clinical psychologist will be notified directly by [CONTACT_424922].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_424706].

The Board  requested the following: 
1. The Board noted that [CONTACT_425136] will act as the new clinical psychologist on the study and 
asked that you confer wit h her regarding the safety plan. The Board specifically requested that 
participant responses on the "Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_424708]" 
(CESD -R) be reviewed immediately, since the proposed plan details a potential nine -day delay 
from a participant's completion of the CESD -R to when they may be contact[INVESTIGATOR_176034]. Flynn for 
evaluation. 
RESPONSE: Thank you for this request. [CONTACT_425139] has reviewed the safety plan and provided 
comments for improvement. Those improvements are shown below in the safety plan and the initial 
phone-based screening questionnaire. Participants’ scores on the CESD-R are now planned to be 
reviewed much more quickly, as described in the updated safety plan below.

Informed Consent  
   
 5 Each potential participant will be fully informed about the nature of the study, its risks and benefits, 
and about his/her rights as a research subject. The person performing the consent will be either [CONTACT_425134] or a trained undergraduate trained research assistant. The participant will sign and receive a copy of the document stating that he/she has given his/her informed consent to participate before interviewing is begun. In every instance, project personnel will verbally review the content of the consent form before participants sign.    
 
   
 [ADDRESS_536925] and met entrance criteria for having prehypertension or hypertension, or another cardiovascular risk factor that could be influenced by [CONTACT_424896]. In order to assess the effects of these practices, you will be asked to complete some questionnaires, and a laboratory assessment before and after learning the mindfulness practices.  
 
1b.   Explanation of Procedures   
 If you agree to participate, you will be asked to consent to the following:  
 1) Participate in an interview in which you will be asked questions about past and present mental health, 
including depression and suic ide. 
 
2) Complete questionnaires about a wide range of topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], including your diet, physical activity, smoking, medication use, personality, emotions, attention and past experiences, including stressful or traumatic experiences. These questions will probe sensitive psychological areas, including physical, emotion and sexual abuse. These questionnaires may take up to 1.[ADDRESS_536926] the right not to answer any of the questions.  
 
3) Directly assessed blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference and hip circumference.  
 
4) You will be asked to perform some cognitive tasks. One of these tasks may involve computer- based 
tests of attention or decision- making. Together these tests may take as long as 30 minutes.  
 
5) You may  be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to enter one of two different  8-week  
meditation programs.  
 
6) You will participate in an 8-week  medi tation program, which consists of [ADDRESS_536927] of practicing mindfulness exercises with the aid of a guided audio CD and complet ing worksheets related to stress, thoughts, and common reactions to various types of events. 
 
 7 7) Class sessions will be audio taped so we can analyze the quality of the treatment you receive. The 
recordings may be transcribed so that we can  analyze the text. The recordings will be identified by 
[CONTACT_5056], will only be heard by [CONTACT_424897].  
 
8) You will be asked to complete a few short questionnaires each week during the 8 week  condition. 
 9) After 8 week s, you will be asked to complete questionnaires and return to the laboratory to repeat the 
same procedures for a second day of testing. 
 
10) Three months  after the end of the [ADDRESS_536928] 
circumference.  2 hours  
Mindfulness course  9 sessions that are 2.5 hours each.  
1 retreat day on a Saturday that will be 8 hours 
Total course time: 30.5 hours  
Home mindfulness practices assigned during 
course.  1 hour per day, 6 days per week, for 8 weeks.  
Total time: [ADDRESS_536929] 3 months after 
course completion.  2 hours  
TOTAL TIME COMMITMENT FOR STUDY  85 hours  
  
Feedback:  
At the end of the study, you will receive individual feedback about the changes that occurred since the first assessment. Specifically, you will receive an individualized handout listing % change (increase or decrease) on scales of attention, stress, mood, health behavi ors, weight, and blood pressure across the 
study.  
 
2.  Discomforts and Risks 
The questionnaires are routine, standardized forms for epi[INVESTIGATOR_20851].  Certain questions may be upsetting as they may probe sensitive psychological areas and inquire about upsetting or traumatic events, including physical, sexual or emotional abuse and/or current psychiatric symptoms.  Since your participation is voluntary, you have the right to skip any questions that make you uncomfortable.  
 [ADDRESS_536930] benefits from this study.  However, pa rticipation in the study creates the potential benefit of a) identifying effective treatments for 
elevated blood pressure, b) gaining knowledge of the effects of mindfulness practices, c ) receiving 
information about your psychological and physical functioning.  
 
4.  Alternative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
A number of different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including antihypertensive medication, diet changes, physical activity, and reducing excessive alcohol consumption may also be beneficial for reducing blood pressure. Education about these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424667], but other forms of these alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424668].  
 
5.  Confidentiality   
Your responses for this study will be kept confidential.  All data that we collect will be linked to a stud y 
ID# instead of your name.  All questionnaires in this study will be filled out through an online survey website (SurveyMonkey)  or a paper version of the survey if you prefer .  All of these questionnaires will 
be linked solely to your study ID#, so that your identity is protected and your answers are confidential.  Although these measures have been taken to protect your personal information, complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed when transmitting information over the internet.  
While your confident iality is protected to the extent of the law, there are limitations to confidentiality. If 
your questionnaire responses indicate that you pose a serious danger to yourself or to another person, then a collaborator [provide name] who is a licensed psychiatr ist, may contact [CONTACT_424924] a treatment provider. Questionnaire items that may warrant follow -up include 
endorsements of statements about hurting yourself, any high scores in depression, anxiety, or other clinica lly significant problems. You should also know that there are times when the law might require the 
release of your responses without your permission.  For example, State law requires researchers to report abuse or neglect of children to the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF).   State law also requires researchers to report abuse or neglect of people age [ADDRESS_536931] that you cannot be identified. All personally identifiable information will be "de -identified" and only a unique 
code number will be used. Study records will be identified with a unique code number and initials. All study records and specimens will be stored in a secure storage area.  
Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_72058] : The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_424703].  
6.  Refusal/Withdrawal  
Participation is voluntary, and you may decide to opt out or refuse any part of participation, including not answering certain questions. If you decide now to participate, you can change your mind later and quit the study.   The decision to not participate or to withdraw from the study will not adversely affect current or 
future interactions with Brown University. The decision to not participate or to withdraw from the study 
will also not adversely affect your relationship with your physician.

SAFETY PLAN  
If a participant’s interview or questionnaire responses indicate that he/she poses a serious danger to 
him/herself or to another person, then the safety plan described below will be triggered into effect.  
1 HOW QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE RISK  
1.1 Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)  
 
The BAI was designed to measure clinical anxiety in a way that minimizes the overlap between 
depression and anxiety.1 A BAI score of 26 -63 represents severe anxiety.1 Questionnaires will be 
reviewed within 48 hours  of completion. If participants score ≥[ADDRESS_536933]. Ellen Flynn, to determine need for a 
psych iatric consultation.  
1.2 Centers for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_424709] (CESD-R) Scale 
 
The 20 items in CESD -R scale measure symptoms of depression in nine different groups as defined by 
[CONTACT_424921], fourth edition.2 These symptom 
groups are shown below, with their associated scale question numbers.  
1. Sadness (dysphoria): Question numbers 2,4, [ADDRESS_536934] (anhedonia): Question numbers 8, 10  
3. Appetite:  Question numbers 1, 18 
4. Sleep:  Question numbers 5, 11, 19  
5. Thinking / concentration:  Question numbers 3, 20  
6. Guilt (worthlessness): Question numbers 9, 17  
7. Tired (fatigue): Question numbers 7, 16  
8. Movement (agitation): Question numbers 12, 13  
9. Suicidal ideation:  Question numbers 14, [ADDRESS_536935]. Ellen Flynn, to determine need for a psychiatric consultation.  
 
If participants respond having any suicidal ideation (CESD -R questions 14 or 15), this will trigger the 
safety plan where [CONTACT_425139]  will be immediately notified directly by [CONTACT_424925]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_424710].  
 
1.3 Other Triggers for the Safety Plan 
 
During the phone- based screening, if participants respond yes to “Are you currently suicidal?”, the 
interviewer will immediately have [ADDRESS_536936] a study participant on the phone who is currently suicidal. Please call 911 
immediately, and tell them:  
 
“I am calling on behalf of [my name] who is performing a research study at Brown 
University, and has a participant on the phone who says they are currently suicidal.” 
Please provide the participants’ contact [CONTACT_424926] 911 operator (i.e. name, 
address, phone #, email address) as requested. This information is on page 1 of the 
screening questionnaire right here [interviewer has this information].  
 
Finally, after calling 911, please call [CONTACT_425136], who is the psychiatrist supporting 
this study. Her cell phone # is 401- 258-9829. Please provide her with the same 
information as was done during the 911 call.  
 
While keepi[INVESTIGATOR_424711], questions to be asked, in this order , include:  
1. “Do you have a plan?”  
2. If yes… “What are you planning?”  
3. “Do you have the means to commit suicide?”  
4. “Do you have access to a gun?”  
5. “We are really concerned about you, and are calling 911.”  
 
Other questions  that could be asked in order to keep them on the phone:  
• “Tell me what is going on.”  
• “What’s happening right now?”  
 
The following information can be provided to study participants if they state they have had considered 
killing themselves in the past month. If they are currently suicidal, the main priority is to keep them on the 
phone while [ADDRESS_536937]. Flynn are being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
 
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1- [PHONE_113] 
 Other options are to:  
• Call your doctor’s office  
• Call 911 for emergency services  
• Go to the nearest hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9487].

1. The plan says that [CONTACT_425139] will be notified immediately if participants meet the criteria for a 
major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_316429], but right above that, Section 1.2 says that the 
questionnaires will be reviewed within 48 hours of completion. Will these questionnaire not be 
immediately reviewed? Since these measures will not be completed in-person, if they may not be 
reviewed for [ADDRESS_536941] with a participant in trouble for 2 days. The 
IRB feels that this is too long a delay to review these measures. 
 
RESPONSE: The anxiety and depressive symptomatology questionnaires have now been moved to 
be completed in-person instead of at home. Responses will be reviewed immediately upon completion 
of the in-person assessments. Values of concern will be reported immediately to [CONTACT_425139].  
 
CHANGE: Please see underlined changes to the safety plan on pg. 11.  
 
 
2. The IRB also feels that the RA should not ask the types of clinical questions, as described in 
Section 1.3's script for talking to suicidal participants. The exact language the RA will use when 
speaking with participants does not need to be reviewed by [CONTACT_1201], but once a participant 
expresses suicidal ideation, (step 1) [CONTACT_425139] should be contact[CONTACT_21116] (step 2) the RA should 
speak calmly with the participants about what the RA is doing (calling [CONTACT_425139]) and why. The 
RA can speak with participants to keep them on the phone, but the discussion should not be 
clinical in nature.  
 
 
RESPONSE: The clinical questions have been removed. Recommended steps [ADDRESS_536942] been 
implemented.  
 
CHANGE: Please see underlined changes to the Safety Plan on pg. 12.  
 
 
3. The revised consent document's new activities/time table (pg. 7) says the total time commitment 
is [ADDRESS_536943] the consent 
document? 
 
RESPONSE: This has been changed to 85.5 hours as suggested.  
 
CHANGE: Please see underlined change to the consent document on pg. 6.  
 
 
  
 3  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
Informed Consent 
 
  
 4 Each potential participant will be fully informed about the nature of the study, its risks and benefits, 
and about his/her rights as a research subject. The person performing the consent will be either [CONTACT_425134] or a trained undergraduate trained research assistant. The participant will sign and receive a copy 
of the document stating that he/she has given his/her informed consent to participate before interviewing 
is begun. In every instance, project personnel will verbally review the content of the consent form before 
participants sign.   
 
 
  
 [ADDRESS_536944] and met entrance 
criteria for having prehypertension or hypertension, or another cardiovascular risk factor that could be 
influenced by [CONTACT_424896]. In order to assess the effects of these practices, you will be asked to complete 
some questionnaires, and a laboratory assessment before and after learning the mindfulness practices. 
 
1b.   Explanation of Procedures   
 
If you agree to participate, you will be asked to consent to the following:  
 
1) Participate in an interview in which you will be asked questions about past and present mental health, 
including depression and suicide. 
 
2) Complete questionnaires about a wide range of topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], including your diet, physical activity, smoking, 
medication use, personality, emotions, attention and past experiences, including stressful or traumatic 
experiences. These questions will probe sensitive psychological areas, including physical, emotion 
and sexual abuse. These questionnaires may take up to 1.[ADDRESS_536945] the right not to answer any of the questions.  
 
3) Directly assessed blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference and hip circumference.  
 
4) You will be asked to perform some cognitive tasks. One of these tasks may involve computer-based tests of attention or decision-making. Together these tests may take as long as 30 minutes. 
 5) You may be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to enter one of two different 8-week  
meditation programs. 
 
6) You will participate in an 8-week  meditation program, which consists of [ADDRESS_536946] of practicing mindfulness exercises with the aid of a guided audio CD and completing worksheets related to stress, thoughts, and common reactions to various types of events. 
 
 6 7) Class sessions will be audio taped so we can analyze the quality of the treatment you receive. The 
recordings may be transcribed so that we can analyze the text. The recordings will be identified by 
[CONTACT_5056], will only be heard by [CONTACT_424897].  
 
8) You will be asked to complete a few short questionnaires each week during the 8 week condition. 
 
9) After 8 weeks, you will be asked to complete questionnaires and return to the laboratory to repeat the 
same procedures for a second day of testing. 
 
10) Three months after the end of the [ADDRESS_536947] 
circumference.  2 hours 
Mindfulness course 9 sessions that are 2.5 hours each.  
1 retreat day on a Saturday that will be 8 hours 
Total course time: 30.5 hours 
Home mindfulness practices assigned during 
course.  1 hour per day, 6 days per week, for 8 weeks.  
Total time: [ADDRESS_536948] 3 months after 
course completion. 2 hours 
TOTAL TIME COMMITMENT FOR STUDY 85.5 hours 
 
 
Feedback: 
At the end of the study, you will receive individual feedback about the changes that occurred since the 
first assessment. Specifically, you will receive an individualized handout listing % change (increase or 
decrease) on scales of attention, stress, mood, health behaviors, weight, and blood pressure across the 
study.  
2.  Discomforts and Risks 
The questionnaires are routine, standardized forms for epi[INVESTIGATOR_20851].  Certain questions may be upsetting as they may probe sensitive psychological areas and inquire about upsetting or traumatic events, 
including physical, sexual or emotional abuse and/or current psychiatric symptoms.  Since your 
participation is voluntary, you have the right to skip any questions that make you uncomfortable.  
 [ADDRESS_536949] benefits from this study.  However, participation in the study creates the potential benefit of a) identifying effective treatments for 
elevated blood pressure, b) gaining knowledge of the effects of mindfulness practices, c) receiving 
information about your psychological and physical functioning. 
 
4.  Alternative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
A number of different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including antihypertensive medication, diet changes, physical activity, and reducing excessive alcohol consumption may also be beneficial for reducing blood pressure. 
Education about these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424667], but other forms of these alternative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424712]. 
 
5.  Confidentiality  
Your responses for this study will be kept confidential.  All data that we collect will be linked to a study ID# instead of your name.  All questionnaires in this study will be filled out through an online survey 
website (SurveyMonkey) or a paper version of the survey if you prefer.  All of these questionnaires will 
be linked solely to your study ID#, so that your identity is protected and your answers are confidential.  
Although these measures have been taken to protect your personal information, complete confidentiality 
cannot be guaranteed when transmitting information over the internet. 
 
While your confidentiality is protected to the extent of the law, there are limitations to confidentiality. If 
your questionnaire responses indicate that you pose a serious danger to yourself or to another person, then 
a collaborator [provide name] who is a licensed psychiatrist, may contact [CONTACT_424924] a treatment provider. Questionnaire items that may warrant follow-up include 
endorsements of statements about hurting yourself, any high scores in depression, anxiety, or other 
clinically significant problems. You should also know that there are times when the law might require the 
release of your responses without your permission.  For example, State law requires researchers to report 
abuse or neglect of children to the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF).   State law also 
requires researchers to report abuse or neglect of people age [ADDRESS_536950] that 
you cannot be identified. All personally identifiable information will be "de-identified" and only a unique 
code number will be used. Study records will be identified with a unique code number and initials. All 
study records and specimens will be stored in a secure storage area. 
Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_72058]: The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_424703].  
6.  Refusal/Withdrawal 
Participation is voluntary, and you may decide to opt out or refuse any part of participation, including not 
answering certain questions. If you decide now to participate, you can change your mind later and quit the 
study.  The decision to not participate or to withdraw from the study will not adversely affect current or 
future interactions with Brown University. The decision to not participate or to withdraw from the study 
will also not adversely affect your relationship with your physician.

SAFETY PLAN  
If a participant’s interview or questionnaire responses indicate that he/she poses a serious danger to 
him/herself or to another person, then the safety plan described below will be triggered into effect.  
1 HOW QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE RISK  
1.1 Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)  
 
The BAI was designed to measure clinical anxiety in a way that minimizes the overlap between 
depression and anxiety.1 A BAI score of 26 -63 represents severe anxiety.1 The BAI will be administered 
during the in-person  assessment visits , and scores will be reviewed immediately upon completion of the 
in-person assessments.  If participants score ≥[ADDRESS_536952]. Ellen Flynn, to determine need for a psych iatric 
consultation.  
1.2 Centers for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_424709] (CESD -R) Scale 
 
The [ADDRESS_536953] etion of the in -person assessments.  
1. Sadness (dysphoria): Question numbers 2,4, [ADDRESS_536954] (anhedonia): Question numbers 8, 10  
3. Appetite:  Question numbers 1, 18  
4. Sleep:  Question numbers 5, 11, 19  
5. Thinking / concentration:  Question numbers 3, 20  
6. Guilt (worthlessness): Question numbers 9, 17  
7. Tired (fatigue): Question numbers 7, 16  
8. Movement (agitation): Question numbers 12, 13  
9. Suicidal ideation:  Question numbers 14, [ADDRESS_536955]. Ellen Flynn, to determine need for a psychiat ric consultation. 
 
If participants respond having any suicidal ideation (CESD -R questions 14 or 15), this will trigger the 
safety plan where [CONTACT_425139] will be immediately notified  directly by [CONTACT_424928]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_424710].  
 
1.3 Other Triggers for the Safet y Plan  
 
During the phone -based screening, if participants respond yes to “Are you currently suicidal?”, the 
interviewer  should perform  the following  2 steps:  
 
 [ADDRESS_536956] a study participant on the phone who is currently suicidal. Please call 911 
immediately, and tell them: 
 
“I am calling on behalf of [my name] who is performing a research study at Brown 
University. She has a participant on the phone who says they are currently suicidal.” 
Please provide the participants’ contact [CONTACT_424926] 911 operator (i.e. name, 
address, phone #, email address) as requested. This information is on page 1 of the 
screening questionnaire right here [interviewer has this information]. 
 
Finally, after calling 911, please call [CONTACT_425136], who is the psychiatrist supporting this study. Her cell phone # is [PHONE_8832]. Please provide her with the same 
information as was done during the 911 call.  
 
 
2. While spe aking calmly with the participant, let them kn ow what you are doing. Specifical ly, let them 
know we are calling our study’s psychiatrist [CONTACT_425139] and 911, and wh y you are doing that  (i.e. 
because we are concerned about you) . You can speak with participant  to keep  him/her  on the phone, 
but the discussion should not be clinical in nature .   
 Examples of  questions that could be asked in order to keep them on the phone: 
• “Tell me what is going on.”  
• “What’s happening right now?”  
• Tell me more about why you are interesting in being part of this study.  
• What are you hopi[INVESTIGATOR_424713]?  
 
 The following information can be provided to study participants if they state they have had considered killing themselves in the past month. If they are currently suicidal, the main priority is to keep them on the 
phone while [ADDRESS_536957]. Flynn are being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].

 1) Provide a brief lay summary of the overall project. Include enough 
detail to allow the IRB to  evaluate the requested change(s) within 
the context of the overall project.  
 
The World Health Organization reported that suboptimal blood pressure (BP) is responsible 
for more than half of cardiovascular disease mortality world -wide. Furthermore, greater than half 
of those with hypertension have uncontrolled BP . A 2009 Institute of Medicine report 
recommended prioritizing research to “Compare the effectiveness of mindfulness -based 
interventions (e.g. yoga, meditation, deep breathing training) and usual care in treating… 
cardiovascular risk factors. ”  Evidence -based mindfulness interventions, including Mindfulness -
Based Stress Reduction, may have some effects on blood pressure, where a recent meta -
analysis and systematic review of [ADDRESS_536959] sizes (range 0 -5 mmHg). Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction 
(MBSR) has been customized to a number of disease proce sses, such as Mindfulness- Based 
Cognitive Therapy for patients with recurrent depression, and Mindfulness -Based Relapse 
Prevention for patients with substance use addictions. Effect sizes have been increased by [CONTACT_424929]. The same may be true for 
hypertension, h owever mindfulness interventions customized for prehypertensive/hypertensive 
patients have never been investigated.  Until methodologically rigorous studies to evaluate 
customized interventions for hypertension are performed, we will not know if the observed 
preliminary effects of general mindfulness interventions on blood pressure reduction could be 
much more effective with a tailored approach.  Consequently, we propose to conduct a stage I 
behaviora l therapy intervention study to evaluate whether MBSR customized to prehypertensive 
and hypertensive patients has the potential to provide clinically relevant reductions in BP. 
Consequently the specific aims are:  
 Stage 1a: Therapy Development/Manual Writi ng 
1 To outline and evaluate key novel elements of mindfulness -based hypertension therapy 
(MBHT), customized from the evidence -based MBSR. We hypothesize that the most 
important novel element will be generation of mindfulness skills specifically applied to 
hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical activity, obesity, alcohol consumption and 
antihypertensive medication adherence.  This aim will be achieved using (1) focus groups of 
participants undergoing the MBHT behavioral intervention, (2) discussion w ith experts 
(including cardiologists, epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543], mindfulness experts, mindfulness intervention instructors) prior to, and following pi[INVESTIGATOR_424693], and (3) clinical 
judgment of the investigators performing the intervention.  
2 To determine effectiveness of MBHT on primary outcomes (systolic blood pressure, 
retention rates, recruitment rates, and adverse effects) and secondary outcomes (hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical activity, obesity, and antihypertensive medicat ion adherence) in hypertension subgroups, specifically participants with (1) 
prehypertension, (2) controlled hypertension, and (3) uncontrolled hypertension. Initial decisions about the targeted sample based on hypertension status will be made.  
[ADDRESS_536960] one closely supervised training session.  
 
Stage Ib: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238]  
4 To determine whether a mindfulness -based hypertension therapy (MBHT) intervention, 
customized from the evidence- based MBSR, has promise to be an effective behavioral 
therapy for participants with hypertension and/or prehypertension. We will perform a 
randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t trial for MBHT vs.  enhanced usual care control. We hypothesize 
that MBHT will have adequate recruitment rates (≥10% of prehypertensive/hypertensive participants invited from physicians’ offices), fairly low drop out rates (<15%), and medium 
effect sizes (e.g. 5 -10 mmHg systolic BP) for reduction in blood pressure.  
 
These findings will provide publishable pi[INVESTIGATOR_424714] -term changes in blood pressure vs. usual care and 
active control groups. If proven effective, MBHT could be offered as a complementary program 
in the prehypertensive/hypertensive patient population that contributes to over half of the 
cardiovascular disease mortality world- wide.  
  
2) Provide a detailed description of the changes being requested (Use 
additional pages, if necessary):  
 
1. Survey software:  
a. We changed the survey software from SurveyMonkey to Qualtrics . We will ensure 
that all software options that allow for personally identifiable information to be 
automatically obtained from Qualtrics (e.g. IP addresses) have been turned off. This 
is done through the “Anonymize Response” Survey Option that ensures IP 
addresses and panel information are removed from each survey.   
 
2. Phone screening questionnaire:  
a. We updated the script for Research Assistants to use, to improve clarity. The 
changes to the script are shown in yellow highlighted text on pp. 3, 4, 5, 7, [ADDRESS_536961] in -person screening assessment:  
a. We clarified the Safety Plan for the Research Assistants, shown in highlighted yellow 
on pg. 19 in Appendix 2. The protocol has not been changed; only the language so 
that the exact steps have been clarified to the Research Assistants.  
 
4. Consent form:  
a. Reference to the SurveyMonkey software was removed  
b. Reference to the control group was removed, as we are not using a control during 
the initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_424715].  
c. The time commitment for the questionnaires has been updated to more accurately 
reflect the expected time commitment.  
d. The text now states that the class sessions “will be” audio recorded instead of “may 
be” audio recorded, as this better reflects the needs of the study to evaluate 
intervention fidelity.  
 
      
 
 
 
 5. Baseline Survey:  
a. Three questionnaires have been added to the baseli ne survey, shown below. The 
specific questions are shown in yellow highlighted text in the attached Baseline 
Questionnaire on pp. 56 -59 in Appendix 4.   
i. Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (IA).1 
ii. Experiences Questionnaire (measure of reperceiving/decent ering) (EQ).2  
iii. Cognitive Emotion Regulation Scale (CR).3 
 
6. Protocol for Physicians to Refer Patients to Mindfulness -Based Hypertension Therapy Study  
a. We were contact[CONTACT_426] a physician named Cathleen Hood who would like to refer some of her patients to the study . A protocol that we will provide to her and other 
interested physicians for patient referral is attached (Appendix 5).

OK, great. How about I give a quick overview of the study, and can then answer any 
questions you may have to see if it is a good fit for you. We will then go through a 
screening questionnaire to see if you quali fy for the study. Does this sound OK?  
A basic overview of the study is that it is looking to see if mindfulness practices improve 
blood pressure, and if education about hypertension risk factors may also improve blood 
pressure. Specifically, we will provide training in meditation, mindful move ments, and the 
roles of things like diet, physical activity and medication in reducing blood pressure. You 
will be taught by a very experienced teacher who in an expert in these fields. The course 
takes place weekly for [ADDRESS_536962]? [answer any they may 
have.]  
SQ08 . Does this study sound like something you would be interested in doing? Yes  No  
[If yes, proceed to next statement below. If no, politely thank the participant for considering 
being in this study, and end the call].   
Great. There are a few things that I would like to make clear before we start the interview. 
First of all, some of the questions that I will ask now to figure out if you are eligible to be 
in this study will be very personal and sensitive.  
 
SQ09 . Are you in a pr ivate place to talk?  
 
[If yes, proceed to text below. If no, reschedule meeting using variables SQ04 and SQ05 above].

During the phone -based screening, if participants respond yes to “Are you currently suicidal?”, 
the interviewer should perform the following 2 steps:  
 
1. Immediately have [ADDRESS_536964] a study participant on the phone who is currently suicidal. Please call 911 
immediately, and tell them:  
 
“I am calling on behalf of [my name] who is performing a research study at Brown University. She has a participant on the phone who says they are currently suicidal.” 
Please provide the participants’ contact [CONTACT_424926] 911 operator (i.e. name, 
address, phone #, email address) as requested. This information is on page 1 of the screening questionnaire right here [interviewer has this information].  
 
Finally, after calling 911, please call [CONTACT_425136], who is the psychiatrist supporting this study. Her cell phone # is 401 -258-9829. Please provide her with the same 
information as was done during the 911 call.  
 
2. While speaking calmly with the participant, let them know what you are doing. 
Specifically, let them know we are calling our study’s psychiatr ist [CONTACT_425139] and 911, 
and why you are doing that (i.e. because we are concerned about you). You can speak 
with participant to keep him/her on the phone, but the discussion should not be 
clinical in nature.   
 
Examples of questions that could be asked in o rder to keep them on the phone:  
• “Tell me what is going on.”  
• “What’s happening right now?”  
• Tell me more about why you are interesting in being part of this study.  
• What are you hopi[INVESTIGATOR_424713]?  
 
The following information can be provided to s tudy participants if  they state they have had 
considered killing themselves in the past month. If they are currently suicidal, the main priority is to keep them on the phone while [ADDRESS_536965]. Flynn are being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].

PROTOCOL FOR PHYSICIANS TO REFER PATIENTS 
TO MINDFULNESS-BASED HYPERTENSION 
THERAPY STUDY 
 
Protocol for Physicians to Refer Patients to  
Mindfulness -Based Hypertension Therapy Study  
 
 
Protocol 
 Option 1:  
1. Physicians will inform their patients about the study, and then ask if they would  
be interested in being contact[CONTACT_424941].  
2. If the patient is interested, the physicia n will ask if the patient would be willing to 
have their contact [CONTACT_424942], including name, phone number and email addre ss.  
3. If the patient agrees, the physician will forward this information to [CONTACT_425135].  
 
Option 2:  
A second option is for physicians to provide an advertisement card  (supplied by [CONTACT_424943]) to their patients and invite them to contact [CONTACT_424944]. This may result in lower participant recruitment rates, 
but is a very acceptable method if the physician prefers this approach.

1. Providing  information on the study, such as the script below.  
 
“I wonder if you may be interested in a research study taking place at Brown 
University, called Mindfulness -Based Hypertension Therapy. The intervention 
includes teachings on mindfulness meditation, mindful movements, education about hypertension, and support for reducing hypertension risk factors. The study 
is testing whether this intervention lowers blood pressure. The program consists 
of nine weekly sessions that are 2.[ADDRESS_537024] a current regular meditation 
practice (i.e. meditate more than once per week) are not eligible. Research 
participation includes interviews, questionnaires and measurements of blood pressure, height, weight, and waist circumference, before and after the 
meditation program. ”

overall project.  
 
The World Health Organization reported that suboptimal blood pressure (BP) is responsible for more than 
half of cardiovascular disease mortality world-wide. Furthermore, greater than half of those with hypertension 
have uncontrolled BP. A 2009 Institute of Medicine report recommended prioritizing research to “Compare the 
effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (e.g. yoga, meditation, deep breathing training) and usual 
care in treating… cardiovascular risk factors.”   Evidence-based mindfulness interventions, including 
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, may have some effects on blood pressure, where a recent meta-
analysis and systematic review of [ADDRESS_537025] sizes 
(range 0-5 mmHg). Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has been customized to a number of 
disease processes, such as Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for patients with recurrent depression, and 
Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention for patients with substance use addictions. Effect sizes have been 
increased by [CONTACT_424929]. The same may be true for 
hypertension , however mindfulness interventions customized for prehypertensive/hypertensive patients have 
never been investigated.  Until methodologically rigorous studies to evaluate customized interventions for 
hypertension are performed, we will not know if the observed preliminary effects of general mindfulness 
interventions on blood pressure reduction could be much more effective with a tailored approach.  
Consequently, we propose to conduct a stage I behavioral therapy intervention study to evaluate whether 
MBSR customized to prehypertensive and hypertensive patients has the potential to provide clinically relevant 
reductions in BP. Consequently the specific aims are: 
 
Stage 1a: Therapy Development/Manual Writing 
1 To outline and evaluate key novel elements of mindfulness-based hypertension therapy (MBHT), 
customized from the evidence-based MBSR. We hypothesize that the most important novel element will 
be generation of mindfulness skills specifically applied to hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical 
activity, obesity, alcohol consumption and antihypertensive medication adherence.  This aim will be 
achieved using (1) focus groups of participants undergoing the MBHT behavioral intervention, (2) 
discussion with experts (including cardiologists, epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543], mindfulness experts, mindfulness 
intervention instructors) prior to, and following pi[INVESTIGATOR_424693], and (3) clinical 
judgment of the investigators performing the intervention.  
2 To determine effectiveness of MBHT on primary outcomes (systolic blood pressure, retention rates, 
recruitment rates, and adverse effects) and secondary outcomes (hypertension risk factors such as diet, 
physical activity, obesity, and antihypertensive medication adherence) in hypertension subgroups, 
specifically participants with (1) prehypertension, (2) controlled hypertension, and (3) uncontrolled 
hypertension. Initial decisions about the targeted sample based on hypertension status will be made. 
[ADDRESS_537026] one closely supervised 
training session.  
 
Stage Ib: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] 
4 To determine whether a mindfulness-based hypertension therapy (MBHT) intervention, customized from 
the evidence-based MBSR, has promise to be an effective behavioral therapy for participants with 
hypertension and/or prehypertension. We will perform a randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_424697]. 
      
 
 
 
 enhanced usual care control. We hypothesize that MBHT will have adequate recruitment rates (≥10% of 
prehypertensive/hypertensive participants invited from physicians’ offices), fairly low drop out rates (<15%), 
and medium effect sizes (e.g. 5-10 mmHg systolic BP) for reduction in blood pressure.  
 
These findings will provide publishable pi[INVESTIGATOR_424725]-term changes in blood pressure vs. usual care and active  control groups. If 
proven effective, MBHT could be offered as a complementary program in the prehypertensive/hypertensive 
patient population that contributes to over half of the cardiovascular disease mortality world-wide.  
 
 
2) Provide a detailed description of the changes being requested (Use additional 
pages, if necessary): 
 
1. NEFS Recruitment Letter 
a. We plan on increasing the participant pool by [CONTACT_424946]/Brown 
University follow-up studies for the National Collaborative Perinatal Project, specifically the 
New England Family Study (NEFS). We will distribute letters to eligible participants of the 
NEFS providing a brief overview of the MBHT study and inquire about their interest in 
participating in the MBHT. Interested participants will then be introduced into the screening 
process and included in the study, if eligible.  
2. In-Person Screening Assessments 
a. Prior IRB applications did not provide clear documentation that there are 2 (not 1) in-person 
screening assessments. There are [ADDRESS_537027] one week apart from each other. This allows for 
daily changes in blood pressure (e.g. due to changes in stress levels) to be accounted for. 
Both in-person screening assessments are now included in Appendix 2.  
b. For the medication questions (pp. 3-17), a question was added asking participants what the 
medication is used for. This question was added to help identify participants’ intended use of 
medications. 
3. Phone Screening Questionnaire 
a. Minor wording changes were made to improve clarity to participants, shown in Appendix [ADDRESS_537028] info (contact [CONTACT_424947]), so that it can 
be presented to a staff member if the safety plan is triggered (pg. 7 of the Phone Screening 
Questionnaire). This information is important to be provided to the 911 operator.  
4. Consent Form 
a. We added a footer to the consent form, showing the version number, date, and page 
numbering (Appendix 4).  
 
3.) State the reason (justification) for the requested amendment: 
 
Please see justification in Section 2 above. 
 
4.) What is y our assessment of how the changes will affect the overall 
risk/benefit ratio of the study and the willingness of individuals to participate? 
 
I do not expect any changes to the risk/benefit ratio or willingness of individuals to participate.  
      
 
 
 
  
 
 
5.) Does the requested amendment require new documents or changes to the 
approved consent form or other documents? 
 
Yes. Please see Appendices.

[Date]  
 Dear _____,  
 
     You recently participated in one of our Harvard/Brown University follow-up studies of the National 
Collaborative Perinatal Project. Our group, known as the New England Family Study, is very grateful 
for your participation and this ongoing work has been important in improving our understanding of 
long-term health and development 
     Based on your blood pressure readings from the last study we evaluated your blood pressure in, 
you may qualify for another New England Family Study research project at Brown University. The 
study is designed to evaluate effects of an intervention called Mindfulness-Based Hypertension 
Therapy (MBHT). MBHT combines mindfulness practices such as meditation and mindful movements 
with education about hypertension management and prevention. The aim of MBHT is to create a skill 
set and supportive environment to help to reduce blood pressure, and improve overall well-being. 
Your involvement in this study could help us better understand if MBHT is effective, and how it could 
be improved. The MBHT intervention will take place over [ADDRESS_537029] to speaking with you.

 About the NCPP………………..  
The National Collaborative Perinatal Project was conducted from [ADDRESS_537030] years of a person's life can have an impact on their later life.  
Information was taken on the health of the women participating in the study, their family's health, and 
their living conditions (such as whether or not the household had pets, and who else lived with the 
mother and child).  Once the children were born, they came for regular check-ups to follow their 
development.  The children were followed until they were seven years old.   
The National Collaborative Perinatal Project was a great success.  Data were collected that 
helped prove that pre-birth conditions had an influence on the life and development of children.  It 
helped to establish that conditions like low-birth weight and premature birth may increase a child's 
chances of having health problems, although this is not always the case.  It also helped to establish 
that children who were in play groups or pre-school at an early age often performed very well in 
school.  Support and funding for pre-school programs were increased in part because of the 
information provided by [CONTACT_15365].  As a result of this study, programs were funded that helped all 
women get medical care while they were pregnant and medical care for their infants.   
There have been many follow-up studies that have used the data collected by [CONTACT_424955].  One of these studies looked at whether women whose mothers had a 
difficult time during labor were more likely to have a difficult time when they themselves gave birth.  
With information from this study, doctors are now better able to help women who may have difficult 
pregnancies to take precautions and get extra medical assistance.  
Thanks to the women who participated in the National Collaborative Perinatal Project in the 
1960s and early 1970s, we now know that what happens to children before they are born and during 
their first years of life has a great effect on their development.  As a result of this study, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424727].  In addition, children 
around the country have greater access to medical care.  
In the last few years, many children who were a part of the National Collaborative Perinatal Project 
participated in an important follow-up study.  This study will also help to understand how early life 
events can affect not only early development, but also development into adulthood.   The adults who 
participated in the follow-up study were asked questions about their education, family and emotional 
health to dete rmine how people’s lives have changed since childhood.  In addition, they were asked 
to complete numerous tasks in order to understand things such as memory and attention and how these factors relate to development.    This current phase of the study is still continuing and the 
results are proving to be useful, in large part because of the tremendous amount of time so many 
study children have contributed to the project .

 Commented [EL3]: Note that questionnaires on anxiety 
and depression previously here have been moved to the 
second in -person baseline assessment in order to reduce 
participant burd en for those who do not meet blood 
pressure eligibility criteria at the first in -person assessment. 
As these depression and anxiety questionnaires are not part 
of the eligibility criteria, we felt it was best to assess it after 
we determine if participants  are eligible to be in study (i.e. 
have mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥120/[ADDRESS_537034] and second baseline assessments).

SECOND  IN-PERSON VISIT  SCREENING 
QUESTIONNAIRE AND ASSESSMENT FORM S 
 Commented [EL1]: Note that this is the second in -person 
screening. The first in -person screening is just for blood 
pressure, as it is the only inclusion/exclusion criteria for the 
in-person screening. Blood pressure will be assessed on two 
different days at least a week ap art from each other, to 
account for daily variations in blood pressure due to 
conditions such as stress. The second in -person screening 
measures blood pressure, in addition to other variables 
previously approved by [CONTACT_424956], weight, 
waist c ircumference, depression and anxiety.

Hello, my name [CONTACT_832] ____________. I am calling from the Brown University School of Public 
Health because (name [CONTACT_7481]) expressed interest in participating in our 
mindfulness blood pressure study. Is he/she available to talk at this time? 
 
I would like to do a 10- 15 minute phone interview with you to determine if you are a good 
match for this particular study.  
 
SQ05.  Is now a good time to speak? 
 
[If yes, proceed to SQ05 script below]

OK, great. How about I give a quick overview of the study, and can then answer any 
questions you may have to see if it is a good fit for you. We will then go through a 
screening questionnaire to see if you qualify for the study. Does this sound OK?  
A basic overview of the study is that it is looking to see if mindfulness practices improve 
blood pressure, and if education about hypertension risk factors may also improve blood 
pressure. Specifically, we will provide training in meditation, mindful movements, and the 
roles of things like diet, physical activity and medication in reducing blood pressure. You 
will be taught by a very experienced teacher who in an expert in these fields. The course 
takes place over a 9-week period, where you come to a class once each week for 2.[ADDRESS_537044]? [answer any they may 
have.] 
SQ08.  Does this study sound like something you would be interested in doing? Yes  No 
[If yes, proceed to next statement below. If no, politely thank the participant for considering 
being in this study, and end the call].  
Great. There are a few things that I would like to make clear before we start the interview. 
First of all, some of the questions that I will ask now to figure out if you are eligible to be 
in this study will be of personal nature, including asking about your mental health and 
life’s experiences.  
 
SQ09.  Are you in a private place to talk? 
 
[If yes, proceed to text below. If no, reschedule meeting using variables SQ04 and SQ05 above].  
 
 Because this interview is of a personal nature, it is important that you understand that 
everything you say will be kept strictly confidential.  No one outside of our project will 
ever be able to see your answers, and we will not keep your name [CONTACT_425111]. If you are not eligible after the phone screen, we will destroy your 
information.  If you like, though, we can keep your information on file for future studies.

During the phone-based screening, if participants respond yes to “Are you currently suicidal?”, 
the interviewer should perform the following 2 steps: 
 
1. Immediately have [ADDRESS_537047] a study participant on the phone who is currently suicidal. Please call 911 
immediately, and tell them:  
 
“I am calling on behalf of [my name] who is performing a research study at Brown 
University.  He has a participant on the phone who says they are currently suicidal.” 
Please provide the participants’ contact [CONTACT_424926] 911 operator (i.e. name, 
address, phone #, email address) as reques ted. This information is  shown  above.

 1) Provide a brief lay summary of the overall project. Include enough detail to 
allow the IRB to evaluate the requested change(s) within the context of the 
overall project.  
 
The World Health Organization reported that suboptimal blood pressure (BP) is respon sible for more than 
half of cardiovascular disease mortality world- wide. Furthermore, greater than half of those with hypertension 
have uncontrolled BP . A 2009 Institute of Medicine report recommended prioritizing research to “Compare the 
effectiveness of mindfulness -based interventions (e.g. yoga, meditation, deep breathing training) and usual 
care in treating… cardiovascular risk factors. ”  Evidence -based mindfulness interventions, including 
Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction, may have some effects on blood pressure, where a recent meta -
analysis and systematic review of [ADDRESS_537055] sizes (range 0 -5 mmHg). Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has been customized to a number of 
disease processes, such as Mindfulness -Based Cognitive Therapy for patients with recurrent depre ssion, and 
Mindfulness -Based Relapse Prevention for patients with substance use addictions. Effect sizes have been 
increased by [CONTACT_424929]. The same may be true for hypertension, h owever mindfulness interventions customized for prehypertensive/hypertensive patients have 
never been investigated.  Until methodologically rigorous studies to evaluate customized interventions for 
hypertension are performed, we will not know if the observed preliminary effects of general mindfulness 
interventions on blood pressure reduction could be much more effective with a tailored approach.  
Consequently, we propose to conduct a stage I behavioral therapy intervention study to evaluate whether 
MBSR customized to prehypertensive and hypertensive patients has the potential to provide clinically relevant 
reductions in BP. Consequently the specific aims are:  
 Stage 1a: Therapy Development/Manual Writing  
1 To outline and evaluate key novel elements of mindfulness -based hypertension therapy (MBHT), 
customized from the evidence- based MBSR. We hypothesize that the most important novel element will 
be generation of mindfulness skills specifically applied to hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical 
activity, obesity, alcohol consumption and antihypertensive medication adherence.  This aim will be 
achieved using (1) focus groups of participants undergoing the MBHT behavioral intervention, (2) discussion with experts (including cardiologists, epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543], mindfulness experts, mindfulness 
intervention instructors) prior to, and following pi[INVESTIGATOR_424693], and (3) clinical 
judgment of the investigators performing the intervention.  
2 To determine effectiveness of MBHT on primary outcomes (systolic blood pressure, reten tion rates, 
recruitment rates, and adverse effects) and secondary outcomes (hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical activity, obesity, and antihypertensive medication adherence) in hypertension subgroups, specifically participants with (1) prehypertension, (2) controlled hypertension, and (3) uncontrolled 
hypertension. Initial decisions about the targeted sample based on hypertension status will be made. 
[ADDRESS_537056] one closely supervised training session.  
 Stage Ib: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238]  
4 To determine whether a mindfulness- based hypertension therapy (MBHT) intervention, customized from 
the ev idence -based MBSR, has promise to be an effective behavioral therapy for participants with 
hypertension and/or prehypertension. We will perform a randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_424697]. 
       
 
 
 enhanced usual care control. We hypothesize that MBHT will have  adequate recruitment rates (≥10% of 
prehypertensive/hypertensive participants invited from physicians’ offices), fairly low drop out rates (<15%), 
and medium effect sizes (e.g. 5 -10 mmHg systolic BP) for reduction in blood pressure.  
 These findings will provide publishable pi[INVESTIGATOR_424725] -term changes in blood pressure vs. usual care and active control groups. If 
proven effective, MBHT could be offered as a complementary p rogram in the prehypertensive/hypertensive 
patient population that contributes to over half of the cardiovascular disease mortality world -wide.  
  
2) Provide a detailed description of the changes being requested (Use additional 
pages, if necessary):  
 
1. Change i n funding source 
a. We have an NIH grant  application  (1 UH2 AT009145 -01 entitled “Mindfulness Influences on 
Self-Regulation: Mental and Physical Health Implications”) pending that would provide funding 
to this project.  
2. Change in scope  
a. The NIH grant would pr ovide approximately $[ADDRESS_537057] udies named in the 
grant application as Concurrent Study B1, B2 and C (more details below) . Note that Concurrent 
Study A in the grant (currently approved by [CONTACT_424964]) is nearin g completion, and no additional 
measures will be added. All of these studies are currently funded and underway. IRB approval 
has been obtained for all studies by [CONTACT_424965]  (IRB approval certificates shown in 
Appendix 1 ). The current grant will add some fairly low participant burden measures to each 
study. Each of the study’s host institutions proposes to perform the following additional 
measures, with associated timeline. IRB approval will be obtained by [CONTACT_424966].  
i. Concurrent Study B1: Yoga Program and Dietary Health Behaviors  (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_424730], 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Harvard Medical School)  
1. The grant proposes to add neuroimaging to study participants. This imaging is 
scheduled t o take place no earlier than January 2016.  
ii. Concurrent Study B2: Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction and Dietary Health 
Behaviors (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_424731], UMass Medical School, Worcester).  
1. Additional measures may not be needed for this study, as the major varia bles are 
being assessed. If it appears that additional variables are needed, IRB approval 
will be obtained.  
iii. Concurrent Study C: MINDFUL -PC Study (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_358924] -Olivier, Cambridge Health 
Alliance, Harvard Medical School). All of the following additional measures proposed in 
the grant will go through IRB approval at the host institution, and should represent a 
fairly low increase in participant burden.  
1. During Phase 1 (years 2016 -2017) , we will adapt and pi[INVESTIGATOR_424732] -regulation during 
MBI trials for addiction (smoking cessation).250,[ADDRESS_537058] these targets in this primary care population in order to assess 
       
 
 
 their applicability to medical regimen adherence, and assess t hem for relevance 
and feasibility in the context of the MTPC study. 
2. During Phase 2  (2016 -2018) , we will test the best performing targets from the 
three domain working groups by [CONTACT_424967] w ith daily medication adherence with the most promising 
self-report, behavioral, physiologic, and neuroimaging targets . These targets will 
be identified in Phase 1, and appropriate IRB amendments will be submitted as 
the targets are identified.  
3. Measures to be add ed to Concurrent Study C beginning in January 2016 are as 
follows:  
a. The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI)1 is used to document the 
degree of right handedness. A score of >[ADDRESS_537059] be right handed for  admission into fMRI 
study. This will be completed at screening visit in subjects otherwise eligible for fMRI experiment. (3 min) 
b. Urine or Saliva toxicology:  We will conduct urine or saliva toxicology 
screens for alcohol and illicit drugs at screening visi t and before each MRI 
session. (5 min)  
c. Urine pregnancy screen:  We will conduct a urine pregnancy screen at 
screening visit and before each MRI session. (2 min)  
d. Body Mass Index:  Weight and height will be measured during screening 
visit and BMI will be calcu lated. (2 min)  
e. Stop -Signal Task (SST)
[ADDRESS_537060] (original SST) is similar to previous versions of t he task 
used in neuroimaging studies. A second version (controlled SST) was 
designed to control for the attentional confound inherent in the original 
version. In both versions, subjects are presented with an initial fixation 
cross for 350 ms. This is follo wed by a go signal lasting 1,400 ms in the 
form of a left - or right -pointing arrow in the direction of the required 
response. Finger presses are made with the index finger of each hand. 
Unpredictably, on 20% of the trials, a red circle (the stop signal) appears 
above the location of the go stimulus. This stop signal indicates the need to attempt to inhibit the button press. The delay between the presentation 
of the go and stop signals is termed the stop signal delay (SSD). The 
ability to stop a response is a function of the length of the SSD. The longer the SSD, the more difficult it is to stop. The SSD will be varied from 
trial to trial using a staircase procedure that converges subjects toward an 
overall performance of 50% for each run. In the controlled version of the SST, a continue signal is introduced in the form of a green circle presented below the go signal. Subjects are instructed that, on some 
trials, this continue signal will appear unpredictably, but this should not 
alter their response, i.e., the initiated response to the go signal should be completed. The continue signal occurs on the same number of trials 
(20%) as the stop signal and with the same timing as the previous stop 
signal. The duration of both stop and continue cues is 1,400 msec minus the current SSD. Continue trials thus provide a control condition for the attentional processing associated with the presentation of an unexpected 
       
 
 
 perceptual event in a context in which response inhibition is not required. 
(10 min) 
f. Barratt Impulsiveness Scale  (BIS-11)4 is a 30 -item scale of impulsiveness 
(rated on 4 -point scales from 1 -rarely/never to 4-almost always/always). 
The BIS -11 provides three sub- scores: attentional impulsivity (inability to 
focus on the task at hand and having intrusive, racing thoughts), motor impulsivity (acting without thinking and lacking perseve rance), and non -
planning impulsivity (inability to plan or think carefully about or do challenging tasks). It also provides a total impulsivity score that is reported to be an internally consistent measure of impulsiveness with 
clinical utility for differe ntiating normal individuals from psychiatric patients, 
substance abusers, and prison inmates. (4 min)  
g. Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System  (BIS/BAS)
5 is 
a 24- item questio nnaire rated on a 4- point scale (strong agreement – 
strong disagreement) measuring several domains of impulsivity based on 
Gray’s model of personality. In Gray’s view, there are two basic brain 
systems that control behavior and emotions: the aversive syste m or 
behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and the appetitive system or behavioral approach system (BAS). BIS is activated by [CONTACT_424968]. BAS is activated 
by [CONTACT_424969]. Gray’s personality theory is 
based on the principle that individual differences in personality reflect the variation in sensitivity toward stimuli associated with negative and po sitive 
reinforcement, respectively BIS and BAS. The BIS/BAS scales consist of 20 items that can be allocated to two primary scales: the Behavioral Inhibition System scale (BIS; 7 items) and the Behavioral Approach 
System scale (BAS; 13 items). The BAS can be divided into 3 subscales: 
fun seeking (BAS fun), reward responsiveness (BAS reward), and drive 
(BAS drive). Drug addicts have higher scores on BAS drive, BAS fun, and 
BAS total score than controls
6. (4 min) 
h. MRI Neuroimaging Experiments  will be conducted  at week 0 and/or 
weeks [ADDRESS_537061] the pi[INVESTIGATOR_424733]’ normal 
medication bottles. Participants will be trained in th e use of the devices, 
which should take no longer than [ADDRESS_537062] 
medication vial, the cap records each time the vial is opened to take a 
tablet or capsule. The cap is reusable at the time of refilling. Patients will 
be asked to bring in all current medication bottles to each study visit. At 
       
 
 
 the time of each study visit, the adherence data are downloaded via 
a RFID desktop Reader. The Software can display the information 
immediately on a PC via an intuitive interface. No patient info rmation is 
stored on the devices, ensuring confidentiality. Download session may 
take 15 minutes, but can be completed while participants are completing 
self-report measures. 
b. The NIH grant would s omewhat  expand the scope of the MBHT intervention, as follow s: 
i. Addition of an active control group. This control group w ill be Mindfulness -Based Stress 
Reduction (MBSR), which is time - and attention -matched with MBHT. MBHT is based on 
MBSR, but MBHT customizes MBSR to hypertension and hypertension risk factors. This 
control group is not expected to be added until  approximately  2018. MBSR will be 
performed by [CONTACT_424970]. MBSR teacher certification is fairly extensive, and 
accreditation occurs through the University of [LOCATION_005] Medical School Center fo r 
Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society . MBSR will consist of nine 2.5 -hour 
weekly group sessions and an 8 -hour one- day session. MBSR sessions contain 
instruction and practice in mindfulness meditation, and conversations about stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Students learn a range of mindfulness skills including body scan exercises, 
meditation and yoga. Homework consists of practicing skills for  ≥45 min/day, 6 
days/week. The MBSR classes will be composed only of study participants.  The 
rationale for adding this control group is that MBSR already exists in hundreds of 
medical centers around the [LOCATION_003] and worldwide. If MBHT is not more effective than  an 
existing manualized, standardized, general mindfulness -based intervention such as 
MBSR, it is not needed.  
ii. Addition of electronically -measured medication adherence  monitoring:  measured 
continuously after randomization using electronic medication bottle  caps. Participants 
taking medication to treat hype rtension  will qualify. Medication adherence is calculated 
as the percent of days during which medication was taken as prescribed. These devices 
simply replace the pi[INVESTIGATOR_424734]’ normal medication  bottles. 
Partici pants will be trained in the use of the devices, which should take no longer than [ADDRESS_537063] assessments of physical activity.  The rationale for 
this assessment is that physical activity influences blood pressure, and directly assessed physical activity is more accurate than self -report.  
iv. Fidelity  of MBSR and MBHT treatment: We will assess part icipants’ perceptions of 
provider warmth and credibility using brief measures based on the validated Working 
Alliance Inventory,
[ADDRESS_537064] measures of instructor eff ectiveness.   
v. Participants’ mindfulness practice  diaries will assess regularity of meditation and 
mindfulness  practice s. Please see Appendix [ADDRESS_537065] greater effects on mental 
health outcomes. The same may be true of blood pressure.  
vi. Focus group assessments of experts (including cardiologists, epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543], 
mindfulness experts, mindfu lness intervention instructors) will occur prior to, and 
following pi[INVESTIGATOR_424693]. The rationale for doing these focus groups 
is to maximize  MBHT efficacy, drawing on the knowledge of experts in relevant fields . 
       
 
 
 Adaptions may include , for example, types of specific mindfulness exercises, sequence 
in which modules are introduced, and relative emphasis on different types of modules 
(e.g. mindfulness practices customized to prehypertension/hypertension risk factors vs. 
general mindfulnes s practices).  Inclusion criteria for the focus groups will be the experts 
being one of the professions listed above. Questions will include topi[INVESTIGATOR_424735].  
1. What about this intervention do think is most valuable, and has the greatest 
likelihood of influencing blood pressure, and determinants of blood pressure such 
as physical activity, diet and antihypertensive medication use?  
2. Are there any elements of the intervention you feel could be pruned out, as they 
may be unlikely to have an effect  on blood pressure and determinants of blood 
pressure? If so, what are they? Why do you think they would not have an effect?  
3. All interventions can be improved. How do you think this intervention could be improved?  
vii. Focus groups of participants undergoing th e MBHT behavioral intervention will take 
place following the final week of class. The rationale of doing these focus groups is to 
better adapt MBHT to the unique needs of this population , and maximize intervention 
efficacy . Adaptions may include, for examp le, types of specific mindfulness exercises, 
sequence in which modules are introduced, relative emphasis on different types of 
modules (e.g. mindfulness practices customized to prehypertension/hypertension risk 
factors vs. general mindfulness practices), and class duration. Inclusion criteria for the 
focus groups will be being study participants. Questions will include topi[INVESTIGATOR_424735].  
1. Think back to the beginning of the course. Have you noticed some changes in 
yourself or your life since t hen? If yes, what have you noticed?  
2. Can use card sort that will be anonymous – e.g. cards showing different modules. 
“Put cards for modules you really liked in one pi[INVESTIGATOR_5829], modules you didn’t like in another pi[INVESTIGATOR_5829], and modules you thought were OK but not grea t in a [ADDRESS_537066] buckets for people to put their cards in for “liked module” “didn’t like module” 
or “module was OK”.  
3. What did you most like about this course? What was most helpful?  
4. We want to make this intervention better. You have been throu gh it once. How do 
you think we can make it better?”  
5. Take a vote – raise your hand if you think the session should be 2 h, 2.5 h; same 
for 3 hours. Same for retreat day – 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 8 h.  
6. Every instructor can improve. How can this instructor improve?  
 
3.) State the reason (justification) for the requested amendment:  
 Please see justification s in Section 2 above. 
 
4.) What is your assessment of how the changes will affect the overall 
risk/benefit ratio of the study  and the willingness of individuals to participate?  
 
These assessments should add some participant burden, primarily time associated with questionnaire  
completion,  training and use of medication adherence devices and actigraphy , neuroimaging , and partaking in 
the focus group.  
Potential ben efits to participants include that completing the meditation diaries  in the MBHT study  may 
increase intervention effectiveness, as participants may feel more committed to complete the mindfulness 
exercises because their “homework” is being checked and fo llowed up on. A participant in the most recent 
cycle of the MBHT intervention shared  with me that she felt she would have done more of the assigned home 
       
 
 
 mindfulness practices if she was asked to fill out such a diary.  In addition, MBHT participants receive feedback 
on their health pre- vs. post intervention. The direct assessments of physical activity and medication adherence 
will provide more accurate and higher quality feedback  to participants.  
I do not expect these changes to influence participation or risk/benefit ratio in mean ingful way s.  
 
5.) Does the requested amendment require new documents or changes to the approved consent  form or other documents?  
 
Yes. Please see Appendices [ADDRESS_537067] not added the MBHT control group to the consent form at this 
time, as it will not be offered until approximately 2017. The consent form will be modified accordingly, prior to 
including this control group.

1a.  Nature and Purpose of the Study       
The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of mindfulness practices and health 
education on blood pressure. You have been selected for this study because you expressed 
interest and met en trance criteria for having prehypertension or hypertension, or another 
cardiovascular risk factor that could be influenced by [CONTACT_424896]. In order to assess the effects 
of these practices, you will be asked to complete some questionnaires, and a laborato ry 
assessment before and after learning the mindfulness practices.  
1b.   Explanation of Procedures   
 
If you agree to participate, you will be asked to consent to the following:  
1) Participate in an interview in which you will be asked questions about past a nd present 
mental health, including depression and suicide.  
 
2) Complete questionnaires about a wide range of topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], including your diet, physical activity, 
smoking, medication use, personality, emotions, attention and past experiences, including 
stressful o r traumatic experiences. These questions will probe sensitive psychological areas, 
including physical, emotion and sexual abuse. These questionnaires may take up to [ADDRESS_537087] the right not to answer any 
of the questions.  
 
3) Directly assessed blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference , hip circumference , 
physical activity, and antihypertensive m edication use .  
 
4) You will be asked to perform some cognitive tasks. One of these tasks may involve 
computer -based tests of attention or decision -making. Together these tests may take as long 
as 45 minutes.  
 
5) You will participate in the mindfulness  program, which consists of [ADDRESS_537088] of practicing mindfulness exercises with the aid of a Eric LoucksĀ  9/1/2015 9:23 PM

Feedback:  
At the end of the study, you will receive individual feedbac k about the changes that occurred 
since the first assessment. Specifically, you will receive an individualized handout listing % 
change (increase or decrease) on scales of attention, stress, mood, health behaviors , weight,  and 
blood pressure across the stu dy. 
 
2.  Discomforts and Risks  
The questionnaires are routine, standardized forms for epi[INVESTIGATOR_20851].  Certain questions 
may be upsetting as they may probe sensitive psychological areas and inquire about upsetting or 
traumatic events, including physical, sexual or emotional abus e and/or current psychiatric 
symptoms.  Since your participation is voluntary, you have the right to skip any questions that 
make you uncomfortable.  
Meditation -based interventions may results in discomfort with attention to unpleasant thoughts, 
feelings o r body sensations. Some individuals may experience an initial increase in undesirable 
feelings with increased attention to them.  
 
3.  Benefits  
We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any direct benefits from this 
study.  However, participation in the study creates the potential benefit of a) identifying effective 
treatments for elevated blood pressure, b) gaining knowledge  of the effects of mindfulness 
practices, c) receiving information about your psychological and physical functioning.  
 
4.  Alternative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
A number of different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including antihypertensive medication, diet changes, physical 
activity, and r educing excessive alcohol consumption may also be beneficial for reducing blood 
pressure. Education about these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424667], but other forms of these 
alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424668].  
 
5.  Confidential ity  
Your responses for this study will be kept confidential.  All data that we collect will be linked to 
a study ID# instead of your name.  All questionnaires in this study will be filled out th rough an 
online survey  or a paper version of the survey if yo u prefer.  All of these questionnaires will be 
linked solely to your study ID#, so that your identity is protected and your answers are 
confidential.  Although these measures have been taken to protect your personal information, 
complete confidentiality ca nnot be guaranteed when transmitting information over the internet.  
 
While your confidentiality is protected to the extent of the law, there are limitations to 
confidentiality. If your questionnaire responses indicate that you pose a serious danger to 
yourself or to another person, then a collaborator ([CONTACT_425136]) who is a licensed psychiatrist, 
may contact [CONTACT_424939] a treatment provider. 
Questionnaire items that may warrant follow -up include endorsements of  statements about 
hurting yourself, any high scores in depression, anxiety, or other clinically significant problems. 
You should also know that there are times when the law might require the release of your 
responses without your permission.  For example, State law requires researchers to report abuse 
or neglect of children to the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF).   State law

1. Provide a brief lay summary of the overall project. Include enough 
detail to allow the IRB to evaluate the requested change(s) within 
the context of the overall project.   
  
The World Health Organization reported that suboptimal blood pressure (BP) is responsible 
for more than half of cardiovascular disease mortality world-wide. Furthermore, greater than half 
of those with hypertension have uncontrolled BP. A 2009 Institute of Medicine report 
recommended prioritizing research to “Compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based 
interventions (e.g. yoga, meditation, deep breathing training) and usual care in treating… 
cardiovascular risk factors.”  Evidence-based mindfulness interventions, including Mindfulness-
Based Stress Reduction, may have some effects on blood pressure, where a recent meta-
analysis and systematic review of [ADDRESS_537094] sizes (range 0-5 mmHg). Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction 
(MBSR) has been customized to a number of disease processes, such as Mindfulness-Based 
Cognitive Therapy for patients with recurrent depression, and Mindfulness-Based Relapse 
Prevention for patients with substance use addictions. Effect sizes have been increased by 
[CONTACT_424929]. The same may be true for 
hypertension, however mindfulness interventions customized for prehypertensive/hypertensive 
patients have never been investigated.  Until methodologically rigorous studies to evaluate 
customized interventions for hypertension are performed, we will not know if the observed 
preliminary effects of general mindfulness interventions on blood pressure reduction could be 
much more effective with a tailored approach.  Consequently, we propose to conduct a stage I 
behavioral therapy intervention study to evaluate whether MBSR customized to prehypertensive 
and hypertensive patients has the potential to provide clinically relevant reductions in BP. 
Consequently the specific aims are:  
  
Stage 1a: Therapy Development/Manual Writing   
1. To outline and evaluate key novel elements of mindfulness-based hypertension therapy 
(MBHT), customized from the evidence-based MBSR. We hypothesize that the most 
important novel element will be generation of mindfulness skills specifically applied to 
hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical activity, obesity, alcohol consumption 
and antihypertensive medication adherence.  This aim will be achieved using (1) focus 
groups of participants undergoing the MBHT behavioral intervention, (2) discussion with 
experts (including cardiologists, epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543], mindfulness experts, mindfulness 
intervention instructors) prior to, and following pi[INVESTIGATOR_424693], and 
(3) clinical judgment of the investigators performing the intervention.   
2. To determine effectiveness of MBHT on primary outcomes (systolic blood pressure, 
retention rates, recruitment rates, and adverse effects) and secondary outcomes 
(hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical activity, obesity, and antihypertensive 
medication adherence) in hypertension subgroups, specifically participants with (1) 
prehypertension, (2) controlled hypertension, and (3) uncontrolled hypertension. Initial 
decisions about the targeted sample based on hypertension status will be made.  
3. To develop an MBHT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424739], including procedures for 
training, supervising, and evaluating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Furthermore, acceptable therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424740]. The manual and training program will include themes 
such as specification of unique and common elements of MBHT vs. other interventions, 
description of interventions excluded from MBHT, and specification of key treatment 
parameters such as frequency and duration of treatment, session length, topi[INVESTIGATOR_424741], sequence of sessions, as well as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424742]. The MBHT training will consist of a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34712], a formal didactic 
training seminar, and at least one closely supervised training session.  
  
Stag
e Ib: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238]   
4. To determine whether a mindfulness-based hypertension therapy (MBHT) intervention, 
customized from the evidence-based MBSR, has promise to be an effective behavioral 
therapy for participants with hypertension and/or prehypertension. We will perform a 
randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_424697]. enhanced usual care control. We 
hypothesize that MBHT will have adequate recruitment rates (≥10% of 
prehypertensive/hypertensive participants invited from physicians’ offices), fairly low 
drop out rates (<15%), and medium effect sizes (e.g. 5-10 mmHg systolic BP) for 
reduction in blood pressure.   
  
These findings will provide publishable pi[INVESTIGATOR_424714]-term changes in blood pressure vs. usual care and 
active  control groups. If proven effective, MBHT could be offered as a complementary program 
in the prehypertensive/hypertensive patient population that contributes to over half of the 
cardiovascular disease mortality world-wide.   
  
 
  
2. Provide a detailed description of the changes being requested (Use 
additional pages, if necessary):  
 
Study Protocol 
 
We would like to update you on the following changes made to the overall study protocol…  
 
 NIH funding  – On September 14, 2015, we received notification from the NIH that our grant 
[Award # 1UH2AT009145- 01] has been approved and will be funded in full. 
 
 Control group – we had initially thought we would introduce a control group further down the 
road in 2017 or 2018, but our funding agency (NCCIH) has asked that we add a control group at 
this time.  For this reason, we will be randomly selecting eligible participants to take part in the 
intervention.  Those not selected, will receive enhanced usual care and will be invited to 
participate in the mindfulness training program around six months after the intervention group.  
Enhanced usual care in the setting of this study refers to participants obtaining hypertensive 
treatment through the services typi[INVESTIGATOR_424743]. However, we will help participants 
access these services if needed. 
 
 Participant incentive  – we now have sufficient funds to offer participants a small participant 
incentive for their involvement in the study.  Study participants will be given a participant 
incentive of $[ADDRESS_537095] completed 
the study will be given the incentive. 
 
 Safety Monitoring – as part of the NCCIH submission, a formal Safety Monitoring Protocol was 
created.  We have included that here as part of the study protocol (see Appendix 1 ). 
 
 Assessment Name [CONTACT_425117]  - Several of the assessment document names have been changed.  
We did this both for internal consistency and in order to clarify the timing and purpose of each 
assessment.  Specific name [CONTACT_425118]. 
 
 Consent Form Modifications – we have modified the consent form (see below for details as well 
as Appendix 3 for the revised consent form, v.1.4) 
 
 Additional Follow-up Added  – we have decided to add an additional follow up to the study, 
which will take place at [ADDRESS_537096]-baseline.  The assessments conducted at this follow up will 
be identical to those administered at the 10 week and 6 month follow up visits. 
 
 Questionnaire Revisions  - we have made changes to several of the individual Assessments (see 
below for details as well as Appendices 4-7 for revised assessments) 
 
 
Consent Form (v.1.4, See Appendix 3) 
We have made the following changes to the study consent form: 
 Added clarifying language on study procedures. 
 Added in language about a control group.  We had initially thought we would hold off on 
including a control group until a later date, but our funding agency (NCCIH) has asked that we 
add a control group at this time.  For this reason, we will be randomly selecting eligible 
participants to take part in the intervention.  Those not selected, will receive enhanced usual 
care and will be invited to participate in the mindfulness training program around six months 
after the intervention group. 
 Added more detail about physical activity monitoring (i.e., use of actigraphy monitors) as well 
medication use monitoring (i.e., the use of electronic bottle caps). 
 Added information about focus group involvement post-intervention. 
 Added language on risk of physical injury. 
 We have decided to offer a participant incentive in the amount of $100 USD, paid at the time of 
final follow up visit.  This has been added to the consent form. 
 Added information about the 1 year follow up assessment. 
 Updated the Table Summarizing Activities and Time Commitment for the study 
 
 
Phone Screener: (v.1.4, See Appendix 4) 
 Modified language to make more concise and clear 
 Added information about the randomization process / control group 
 Added in information about the participant incentive 
 Corrected typos  
 Removed the script about scheduling the second In-Person visit.  This will be done at the time of 
the In-Person screener, if the person is found to be eligible for the study and is still interested in 
participating. 
 
 
  
In-Person Screening: (v.1.4, See Appendix 5) 
 Changed the name.   It was formally called the “First In -Person Visit Screening Assessment Form”  
 Moved “Medication Use” to the In -Person Baseline Assessment  – the primary purpose of the 
In-Person Screening Assessment is to determine whether or not an individual is eligible for the 
study (i.e., have mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥120/[ADDRESS_537097] and seco nd baseline 
assessments).  For this reason, we decided to move medication use, which was originally found 
in the “First In -Person Visit Assessment Form” to the In -Person Baseline Assessment since it is 
not part of the eligibility criteria.  This will help to reduce participant burden for those 
individuals who are not eligible. 
 NOTE that the only assessment conducted during the In-Person Screening is Blood Pressure 
measurements. 
 
 
Home Baseline Assessment: (v.1.4, See Appendix 6) 
 Changed the name.  It was formally called the “Baseline Questionnaire”  
 Corrected typos, including skip errors 
 Updated the Table of Contents and Sub-headings in questionnaire 
 Removed Diet questions (DT1_01 – DT1_25); we will assess diet during the In-Person Baseline 
Assessment using the Harvard University 80-out Food Frequency Questionnaire 
 Added a question (TS01_01) on table salt use 
 Added the 11 item validated Craving Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) 
 Moved around some of the sub-scales for ease of administration (noted in text). 
 Removed Social Network questions (SN1_01 – SN1_04) and replaced with the validated 12-item 
Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL-12) 
 Removed the Social Network questions (SN1_01 – SN1_04) 
 Added Blood Pressure Medication Use questions (BM1_01 – BM1_09), which includes the 
validated Morisky 8-item questionnaire1. 
 Added questions that measure “Readiness to change for hypertension risk factors” (RC1_01 –  
RC1_14) 
 Added Family History of Hypertension questions (FH1_01 – FH1_04), which assess biological 
parents’ history of having hypertension, based on questions from New England Family Study 
LEAP Project. 
 Dropped several of the sleep items (SL1_05 – SL1_14a; SL1_16 – SL1_21b) to reduce ppt burden. 
 
 
  
In-Person Baseline Assessment (v.1.4, See Appendix 7) 
 Changed the name.  It was formally called the “Second In -Person Visit Screening Assessment”  
 Added Medication use questions (ME01 – ME10i) 
 Added the validated Harvard University three page Food Frequency Questionnaire, known as 
“80-out”.  It is designed to take around [ADDRESS_537098]. 
 Added two computer-based tests that measure Attention Control.  They are: 
The Attention Network Test (ANT)  is a brief computerized battery measuring three 
independent behavioral components of attention: Conflict resolution (ability to 
overcome distracting stimuli), spatial Orienting (the benefit of valid spatial pre-cues), 
and Alerting (the benefit of temporal pre-cues). Efficiency of orienting is examined by 
[CONTACT_424977]. The efficiency 
of the executive conflict resolution network is examined by [CONTACT_424978] (left or right) of a central arrow 
surrounded by [CONTACT_424979], incongruent or neutral flankers. Moderate to high reliabilities 
are found for all networks.  The ANT takes around 20min to complete. 
 
The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART)  is a computerized test of sustained 
attention, response inhibition (executive function) and self-regulation. Subjects are 
instructed to press a key in response to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_358968] (1-9) and withhold 
response to a designated "no-go" integer. SART errors consist of summed commission 
errors (button press on no-go trial) and omission errors (button not pressed on "go" 
integers). SART performance is associated with prefrontal cortex functioning, has been 
found to increase with mindfulness training and is correlated with scores on 
mindfulness questionnaires (specifically, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale). The 
SART takes around 15min to complete. 
 
 
3. State the reason (justification) for the requested amendment:   
  
Please see justifications in Section [ADDRESS_537099] the overall 
risk/benefit ratio of the study and the willingness of individuals to 
participate?   
  
Overal
l the changes we have made in this amendment affect the risk/benefit ratio in small 
ways.  We have added some question items to the assessments, but have also removed some 
items in order to minimize participant burden. Assessment time has increased by [CONTACT_2902] 1 hour 
per assessment. 
The addition of a participant incentive adds a tangible benefit to participants and serves as a 
potential motivation to complete the study. 
 The inclusion of a formalized Safety Monitoring protocol helps reduce participant risk by 
[CONTACT_424980].

Appendix 1:  
Safety Monitoring Protocol 
 
(Language Taken from the NCCIH Protocol Submission) 
  
Safety Monitoring - as part of the NCCIH submission, a formal Safety Monitoring Protocol was 
created.   It is outlined below.  
Oversight of internal monitoring of the participants’ safety will be conducted by [CONTACT_7676], [CONTACT_425144] and [CONTACT_425137] [CONTACT_359039]. Oversight of the external Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee will be conducted by [CONTACT_67061] ([CONTACT_425145]). The Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee will include experts in cardiology, psychology/psychiatry, epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and 
biostatistics.  
 
Entities Conducting Monitoring 
 The Institutional Review Board (IRBs) at Brown University will review all research 
procedures, and will provide oversight. Internal monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_424981] ([CONTACT_425135] and [CONTACT_425138]) and the Brown University IRB. The Data 
Safety Monitoring Committee will provide external monitoring, and will meet every six months by 
[CONTACT_14379]-person. They will be provided data every six months to evaluate potential effects of 
the RCT on major outcomes (e.g. medical regimen adherence). Any serious adverse effects will 
be immediately reported to the principal investigators (Loucks, Britton) and the committee chair.  
 
What is Monitored 
 Monitoring is done of all procedures to ensure that they conform to the approved protocol; of 
unforeseen circumstances that might arise and affect safety; of all reports of serious adverse 
events as defined in US Department of Health and Human Services regulations for the 
protection of human research subjects 45 CFR Part 46, and the FDA 312.32 (death, life-
threatening experience, new or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity); of other significant adverse events (adverse events that lead to drop out by 
[CONTACT_215750]); of unexpected adverse events resulting from the 
study; and of expected adverse events.  
 Monitoring is done of all study inclusion and exclusion criteria. During this clinical trial, we 
will notify officials, as mandated by [CONTACT_2371], if a participant reports intentions to harm him/herself or 
others, or reports child abuse or abuse of an elder. [CONTACT_425136], a licensed psychiatrist, w ill 
be available to advise on any psychological events that occur, and provide referrals for 
treatment if needed. 
 
Frequency of Monitoring 
 All adverse events will be continuously monitored by [CONTACT_978]. Participants will be given 
contact [CONTACT_215752]. [CONTACT_425134] will conduct daily oversight of participant safety. He will meet weekly with staff to review 
participant progress and their experiences with the experimental procedures, including adverse 
events. Any adverse events that are observed and/or reported will be immediately reported to 
[CONTACT_425135], [CONTACT_425138], and the Data Safety Monitoring Committee chair. The Investigators and 
Data Safety Monitoring Committee will be available to meet outside of the regularly scheduled 
meetings (scheduled semiannually), if necessary, due to concerns regarding a particular 
participant or any problems that may arise for participants. If necessary, they will make 
appropriate recommendations for changes in protocol, or terminate the study.  The Brown 
University IRB conducts the monitoring at the continuing reviews as scheduled, whenever 
modification requests are considered, and upon receiving reports of serious adverse events 
from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_215717].  
 
Reporting Plan 
Any serious adverse events that are observed and/or reported will be immediately reported 
to [CONTACT_425135] and the Data Safety Monitoring Committee Chair. Serious adverse events are 
then reported to the Brown University IRB and to NIH. Brown’s IRB requires fatalities related to 
the study be reported within [ADDRESS_537100] in writing to the Brown and IRB, which will then grant or deny permission 
to make the requested change or amendment in protocol. NIH will subsequently be informed of 
any substantive changes or amendments in approved protocol. 
 
Injury due to physical activities: It is possible that injuries could be sustained from (1) the gentle 
mindful movements (yoga), or (2) physical activities that participants engage in as a result of the 
intervention encouraging exploration of physical activity as a way to reduce blood pressure. 
 
(1) Mindful movements: Participants receive a handout during the orientation showing the 
yoga poses that will be offered during the course. They are encouraged to explore limits 
in their body related to movement, but not to go beyond those limits Participants are 
asked to listen to what their body is telling them more closely than what the mindful 
movement instructor is telling them. Modifications of poses are available, including for 
those limited to chairs or wheelchairs. Participants are encouraged to bring the handout 
of poses to their health care providers if they have any physical limitations, so that the 
providers can advise on which poses to do, and which to avoid. 
(2) Physical activities: Participants are encouraged to explore physical activities that 
promote strength and conditioning as a way to reduce blood pressure. As with the 
mindful movements, they are encouraged to explore limits in their body related to 
movement, but not to go beyond those limits. Participants are asked to listen to what 
their body is telling them more closely than what the mindful movement instructor is 
telling them. Furthermore, they are encouraged to ask their healthcare provider about 
advised physical activities if they have any physical limitations.  
 
All patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_424982], specifically the following 
questions: 
 
1. Have you sustained any physical injuries during the past 2 weeks?  
 
If yes,  
(a) please describe the injury 
(b) please describe what happened to cause the injury.  
(c) did this injury include  
i. Broken bone(s) yes/no 
ii. Lacerations requiring stiches yes/no 
iii. Concussion yes/no 
 
If injuries include any of the following, it will be reported to Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
member [CONTACT_425146], MD, who is a practicing physician and researcher. He will advise on any 
follow-up needed. It will also be reported to the chair of the Data Safety Monitoring Board.  
 
a. Broken bone(s) 
b. Lacerations requiring stiches 
c. Concussion 
 
Non-Response to Treatment : The possibility that the treatment will not yield benefit is 
another possible risk and will be explained during informed consent procedures. Non-
responders (identified as minimal change in medical regimen adherence from baseline 
assessment) will be provided with referrals to other treatment, if desired.  
INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
If serious adverse events are significantly higher in the treatment vs. control groups, the study 
will be terminated.

 It is possible that injuries could be sustained during the study either from the gentle mindful 
movements (i.e., yoga), or from physical activities that participants engage in as a way to reduce 
blood pressure.   To help limit this, you will receive a handout showing the yoga poses that will 
be offered during the course that you can show your health care provider so that they can advise 
on which poses to do, and which to avoid. Modifications of poses will be available as needed. 
None of the poses (or the yoga as a whole) are mandatory to be done. You will also be 
encouraged to explore physical activities that promote strength and conditioning as a way to 
reduce blood pressure. You will be encouraged to not go beyond any physical limits of your 
body, and will be encouraged to ask your healthcare provider about advised physical activities 
and mindful movements if you have any physical limitations.

questions you may have to see if it is a good fit for you. We will then go through a 
screening questionnaire to see if you qualify for the study. Does this sound OK?  
In this study, we are  looking to see if mindfulness practices improve blood pressure, and 
if education about hypertension risk factors may also improve blood pressure. If eligible 
and if selected to participate , we will provide you with training in meditation, mindful 
movements, and the roles of things like diet, physical activity and medication in reducing 
blood pressure. You will be taught by a very experienced teacher who is an expert in 
these fields. The course is free and will take place over a 9-week period, where you come 
to a class once each week for 2.[ADDRESS_537121], w e will also ask you to

During the phone-based screening, if participants respond yes to “Are you currently suicidal?”, 
the interviewer should perform the following 2 steps: 
 
1. Immediately have [ADDRESS_537126] a study participant on the phone who is currently suicidal. Please call 911 
immediately, and tell them: 
 
“I am calling on behalf of [my name] who is performing a research study at Brown 
University. He has a participant on the phone who says they are currently suicidal.” 
Please provide the participants’ contact [CONTACT_424926] 911 operator (i.e. name, 
address, phone #, email address) as requested. This information is shown above.  
 
Finally, after calling 911, please call [CONTACT_425136], who is the psychiatrist supporting 
this study. Her cell phone # is 401- 258-9829. Please provide her with the same 
information as was done during the 911 call.  
 
2. While speaking calmly with the participant, let them know what you are doing. 
Specifically, let them know we are calling our study’s psychiatrist [CONTACT_425139] and 911, 
and why you are doing that (i.e. because we are concerned about you). You can speak 
with participant to keep him/her on the phone, but the discussion should not be 
clinical in nature.   
 
MBHT Phone Screening, Version 1. 4, November 6 , 2015                      Page 8 of 8 Examples of questions that could be asked in order to keep them on the phone:

The first set of questions ask about foods you usually 
eat or drink.  For each food, please place an X in the 
box (e.g. ) for the answer that best matches how 
often you eat or drink it. Remember to count fruit or 
vegetables that were part of another dish, like a 
banana on cereal or vegetables in a stew. Also, 
please pay attention to the serving sizes. For example, one serving size of bread is one sli ce, so a

 After questionnaires are complete, participants will be asked to perform the following two 
computer-based tests: 
Attention Control: Attention Network Test (20 minutes) 
 
Attention Network Test (ANT)  is a brief computerized battery measuring three independent 
behavioral components of attention: Conflict resolution (ability to overcome distracting stimuli), 
spatial Orienting (the benefit of valid spatial pre-cues), and Alerting (the benefit of temporal pre-
cues). Efficiency of orienting is examined by [CONTACT_424989]. The efficiency of the executive conflict resolution network is 
examined by [CONTACT_424990] (left 
or right) of a central arrow surrounded by [CONTACT_424979], incongruent or neutral flankers. Moderate 
to high reliabilities are found for all networks.

 Sustained Attention to Response Task (15 minutes) 
 
The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) is a computerized test of sustained 
attention, response inhibition (executive function) and self-regulation. Subjects are instructed to 
press a key in response to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_358968] (1-9) and withhold response to a 
designated "no-go" integer. SART errors consist of summed commission errors (button press on 
no-go trial) and omission errors (button not pressed on "go" integers). SART performance is 
associated with prefrontal cortex functioning, has been found to increase with mindfulness 
training and is correlated with scores on mindfulness questionnaires (specifically, the Mindful 
Attention Awareness Scale).

 If participants respond having any suicidal ideation (DS questions 14 or 15), perform the 
following 2 steps:  
 
1. Immediately call [ADDRESS_537179]. Ellen Flynn.  
 
Specifically, while the participant is in the waiting room, call 911 immediately, and tell 
them: 
 
“My name [CONTACT_832] _____. I am working on a research study at Brown University. I have a study 
participant in the waiting room who has shared that he/she is currently suicidal.” Please 
provide the participants’ name [CONTACT_425112] [ADDRESS_537180] supporting 
this study. Her cell phone # is 401- 258-9829. Please provide her with the same 
information as was done during the [ADDRESS_537181]. Flynn, and why (i.e. because we are concerned about you). You can speak 
with participant to keep him/her in the waiting room if 911 has sent assistance, but 
the discussion should not be clinical in nature.   
 
Examples of questions that could be asked in order to keep them in the waiting room: 
 “Tell me what is going on.” 
 “What’s happening right now?” 
 Tell me more about why you are interesting in being part of this study.  
 What are you hopi[INVESTIGATOR_424713]?

E. Loucks r esponses to 12/4/15 email from Ita Irizarry  – RE: "MINDFULNESS -BASED HYPERTENSION 
THERAPY PI[INVESTIGATOR_72001]," Amendment #4 submission . 
 
Questions/Requests :  
1. Regarding the request to add a control group, please confirm if this population will be identified, 
recruited, and consented with the same currently -approved procedures as the intervention group.  
Based on additional feedback from NCCIH on the study protocol, we have decided to hold off at 
this time on implementing the RCT.  We have removed al l language discussing the RCT and have 
attached an updated consent form (v.1.5) and Phone Screener.  We will submit a new amendment 
to the IRB once the RCT is incorporated into the study protocol.  
2. Will the new $100 compensation be provided to all participa nts who complete the study, both 
intervention and control groups? Will the compensation be given at the 1 -year follow -up? 
Yes, all st udy participants will receive the $100.  It will be given out at the time of the 1 -year 
follow -up.  We will not be including a control group at this time.  
3. What is the rationale for adding the 1 -year follow -up visit?  
There is early evidence in other mindfulness studies that have shown increase s in effect by 1 year 
follow -up that were not present at 6 mo nths. This longer follow -up time will allow us to determine 
longer term effectiveness of the intervention.  
4. What is the rationale for revising the screening and baseline assessments?  
The screening assessments were revised to reduce participant burden. We r emoved all 
assessments in the first in -person screening that do not influence if the person qualifies for the 
study or not. For the in -person baseline assessment, we included items move d from the first in -
person screening, as well as added some additional measures that are central to the objectives of 
the recent NIH grant to evaluation impacts of the intervention on measures of self regulation.  
5. For the  In-Person Screening Assessment Form , question BA2_08 (pg. 2) is marked as track -
changed, but this was approved with Amendment #2. Was the question revised?  
No, it was not revised.  It was marked in error.  
6. If you haven't already, please register your study on the  Clinical Tr ials website , per the terms of your 
NIH grant. Section 6 (pg. 254) states that the study must be registered within [ADDRESS_537182] participan t 
enrollment for the NIH -funded study.  
  
Consent Document Revisions : 
1. The Nature and Purpose of the Study  section (pg. 1, 3rd paragraph) only briefly mentions that 
participants may be randomized into the control group. To the  Explanation of Procedures  section, 
please add how that randomized will occur, and provide a further explanation of what participants 
in the control group will be asked to do at the baseline and [ADDRESS_537183] at this time.  
2. Portions of the consent are marked as track -changed, although they were approved with 
Amendment #3. For example, the  Explanation of Procedures  section (pgs. 2 -3, #3) and the 
procedure table (pg. 3, focus group) are marked. Were changes made to these sections?  
No, these two sections were not revised.  They were  marked in error.  We have removed the track 
changes.  
3. To the Discomforts and Risks  section (pg. 4, 3rd paragraph), please add an explanation of what will 
happen if a participant has a research -related injury.  
We have added the following language to the consent form (see v.1.5 attached):  
“While physical and mental injury is always a possibility the potential for harm is limited.  Note 
that a research injury is any physical  or mental  injury or illness caused by [CONTACT_424991]. If you are injured by a medical treatment or procedure that you would have received 
even if you were not in the study, that is not a research injury.  To help avoid research injury and 
potential  added medical expenses, it is important to follow all study directions carefully. If you 
are covered by [CONTACT_424992] a research injury, it is possible that some or all of the costs of 
treating your condition could appropriately be billed to your i nsurance company.  If such costs 
are not covered your health insurance company, it is possible you would have to pay for these 
costs out of pocket.  Brown University’s policies do not cover payment for such things as lost 
wages, medical care expenses, or  pain and suffering.  
 
Precautions should be taken to avoid injuries.   If you do become injured during the study, you 
should call your doctor immediately.   You should also alert the study staff that you have been 
injured.   Heart attack and sudden death related  to heart problems have been known to occur in 
people while they are exercising.   This is very rare, however.   Estimates of sudden cardiac death 
range from 0 to 2 per 100,000 hours.   However, the researchers cannot guarantee that no 
complications will happ en to you.”  
 
4. In the  Benefits  section (pg. 4), please remove the added compensation description. Compensation is 
not considered a benefit, and this information was already added to the  Nature and Purpose of the 
Study  section (pg. 1).  
This has been removed.  
5. As this is clinical trial, please add the required language regarding the Clinical Trials website: "A 
description of this clinical trial will be available on  http://www.Clinical  Trials.gov, as required by 
U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will 
include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time."  This language must be 
added verbatim and cannot be changed, per NIH regulatio ns. 
We have added this language to the last section of the consent.  
  
See below for a summary of changes made to the MBHT study documents since Amendment #4 was 
originally submitted.  These changes were made per discussion with the Brown University IRB; so me 
additional changes have been made in order to reduce participant burden.   All modified documents 
have been included in this email.

1b.   Explanation of Procedures   
 
If you agree to participate, you will be asked to consent to the following:  
1) Participate in an interview in which you will be asked questions about past and present 
mental health, including depression and suicide. 
 
2) Complete questionnaires about a wide range of topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], including your diet, physical activity, 
smoking, medication use, personality, emotions, attention and past experiences, including 
stressful or traumatic experiences. These questions will probe sensitive psychological areas, 
including phy
sical, emotion and sexual abuse. These questionnaires may take up to [ADDRESS_537185] the right not to answer any 
of the questions.  
 
3) Directly assessed blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, 
physical activity, and antihypertensive (blood pressure) medication use at baseline and after 
the mindfulness course. 
Physical activity will be assessed for a week at a time using small 
actigraphy monitors that attach to your wrist and hip. If you take antihypertensive

when the pi[INVESTIGATOR_424747]. This will help us measure how often the 
medication is used. 
 
4) You will be asked to perform some cognitive tasks. One Some of these tasks may involve 
computer-based tests of attention or decision-making. Together these tests may take as long 
as 45 mi
nutes. 
 
5) You will participate in the mindfulness program, which consists of [ADDRESS_537187] of practicing mindfulness exercises with the aid of a 
guided audio CD and completing worksheets related to stress, thoughts, and common 
reactions to various types of events. 
 
6) Class sessions will be audio taped so we can analyze the quality of the treatment you receive. 
The recordings will be transcribed so that we may analyze the text. The recordings will be 
identified by [CONTACT_5056], will only be heard by [CONTACT_424962].  
 
7) You will be asked to complete a few short questionnaires each week during the 9 week 
condition.

Feedback: 
At the end of the study, you will receive individual feedback about the changes that occurred 
since the first assessment. Specifically, you will receive an individualized handout listing % 
change (increase or decrease) on scales of attention, stress, mood, health behaviours, weight, and 
blood pressure a
cross the study. 
 
2.  Discomforts and Risks 
The risks to you in this study are small.  The questionnaires used in the study are routine, 
standardized forms for epi[INVESTIGATOR_20851].  Certain questions may be upsetting as they may 
probe sensitive psychological areas and inquire about upsetting or traumatic events, including 
physical, sexual or emotional abuse and/or current psychiatric symptoms.  Since your 
participation is voluntary, you have the right to skip any questions that make you uncomfortable. 
Meditation-based interventions may results in discomfort with attention to unpleasant thoughts, 
feelings or body sensations. Some individuals may experience an initial increase in undesirable 
feelings with increased attention to them. 
 
MBHT Consent Form, Version 1. 5, December 2 3, 2015    Page 4 of 7  
 It is possible that injuries could be sustained during the study either from the gentle mindful 
movements (i.e., yoga), or from physical activities that participants engage in as a way to reduce 
blood pressure.  To help limit this, you will receive a handout showing the yoga poses that will 
be offered during the course that you can show your health care provider so that they can advise 
on which poses to do, and which to avoid. Modifications of poses will be available as needed. 
None of the poses (or the yoga as a whole) are mandatory to be done. You will also be 
encouraged to explore physical activities that promote strength and conditioning as a way to 
reduce blood pressure. You will be encouraged to not go beyond any physical limits  of your 
body, and will be encouraged to ask your healthcare provider about advised physical activities 
and mindful movements if you have any physical limitations. 
 
While physical and mental injury is always a possibility the potential for harm is limited.  Note 
that a research injury is any physical or mental injury or illness caused by [CONTACT_424991]. If you are injured by a medical treatment or procedure that you would have received 
even if you were not in the study, that is not a research injury.  To help avoid research injury and 
potential added medical expenses, it is important to follow all study directions carefully. If you 
are covered by [CONTACT_424992] a research injury, it is possible that some or all of the costs of 
treating your condition could appropriately be billed to your insurance company.  If such costs 
are not covered your health insurance company, it is possible you would have to pay for these 
costs out of pocket. Brown University’s policies do not cover payment for such things as lost 
wages, medical care expenses, or pain and suffering. 
 
Precautions should be taken to avoid injuries.  If you do become injured during the study, you 
should call your doctor immediately.  You should also alert the study staff that you have been 
injured.  Heart attack and sudden death related to heart problems have been known to occur in 
people while they are exercising.  This is very rare, however.  Estimates of sudden cardiac death 
range from [ADDRESS_537191] benefits from this 
study.  However, participation in the study creates the potential benefit of a) identifying effective 
treatments for elevated blood pressure, b) gaining knowledge of the effects of mindfulness 
practices, c) receiving information about your psychological and physical functioning. 
 
4.  Alternative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
A number of different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including antihypertensive medication, diet changes, physical 
activity, and reducing excessive alcohol consumption may also be beneficial for reducing blood 
pressure. Education about these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424667], but other forms of these 
alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424712]. 
 
5.  Confidentiality  
Your responses for this study will be kept confidential.  All data that we collect will be linked to a 
study ID# instead of your name.  All questionnaires in this study will be filled out through an 
MBHT Consent Form, Version 1. 5, December 2 3, 2015    Page 5 of 7  
 online survey or a paper version of the survey if you prefer.  All of these questionnaires will be 
linked solely to your study ID#, so that your identity is protected and your answers are confidential.  
Although these measures have been taken to protect your personal information, complete 
confidentiality cannot be guaranteed when transmitting information over the internet. 
 
While your confidentiality is protected to the extent of the law, there are limitations to 
confidentiality. If your questionnaire responses indicate that you pose a serious danger to 
yourself or to another person, then a collaborator ([CONTACT_425136]) who is a licensed psychiatrist, 
may contact [CONTACT_424939] a treatment provider. 
Questionnaire items that may warrant follow-up include endorsements of statements about 
hurting yourself, any high scores in depression, anxiety, or other clinically significant problems. 
You should also know that there are times when the law might require the release of your 
responses without your permission.  For example, State law requires researchers to report abuse 
or neglect of children to the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF).   State law 
also requires researchers to report abuse or neglect of people age [ADDRESS_537192] that you cannot be identified. All personally identifiable information will be "de-
identified" and only a unique code number will be used. Study records will be identified with a 
unique code number and initials. All study records and specimens will be stored in a secure 
storage area.

OK, great. How about I give a quick overview of the study, and can then answer any 
questions you may have to see if it is a g ood fit for you. We will then go through a 
screening questionnaire to see if you qualify for the study. Does this sound OK?  
In this study, we are  looking to see if mindfulness prac tices improve blood pressure, and 
if education about hypertension risk factors may also improve blood pressure. If eligible , 
we will provide you with training in meditation, mindful movements, and the roles of 
things like diet, physical activity and medication in reducing blood pressure. You will be 
taught by a very experienced teacher who is an expert in these fields. The course is free 
and will take place over a 9-week period, where you come to a class once each week for 
2.[ADDRESS_537193], w e will also ask you to participate in health assessments 
before and after the study. Health assessments include measures such as blood pressure, height and weight, and questionn aires about your health and experiences.   At

 After questionnaires are complete, participants will be asked to perform the following two 
computer-based tests: 
Attention Control: Attention Network Test (20 minutes) 
 
Attention Network Test (ANT)  is a brief computerized batter y measuring three independent 
behavioral components of attent ion: Conflict resolution (abilit y to overcome distracting stimuli), 
spatial Orienting (the benefit of valid spatial pre-cues), and Alerting (the benef it of temporal pre-
cues). Efficiency of orienting is examined by [CONTACT_424997] t accompany cues indicating 
where the target will occur. The efficiency of the executive co nflict resolution network is 
examined by [CONTACT_424998] (left 
or right) of a central arrow su rrounded by [CONTACT_424979], incongrue nt or neutral flankers. Moderate 
to high reliabilities are found for all networks. 
 
ANT data to be entered by [CONTACT_424999]: 
PPT Age: ______ 
PPT Sex: Male / Female 
Category: Normal 
Diagonal of “subject info” window: 10” 
Press “distance between eyes and screen” button to calculate.  Should be 23.2.  
 
ANT data to be entered by [CONTACT_425000]: 
PPT Age: ______ 
Alerting effect (ms): ______ 
Orienting effect (ms): ______ 
Conflict effect (ms): ______ 
Mean RT for correct trials (ms): ______ 
Mean accuracy (%):______ 
 
 
Sustained Attention to Response Task (15 minutes) 
 
The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) i s a computeriz ed test of sustained 
attention, response inhibition ( executive function) and self-re gulation. Subjects are instructed to 
press a key in respons e to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_424748] (1-9) and  withhold response to a 
designated "no-go" integer. SART  errors consist of summed commission errors (button press on 
no-go trial) and omission errors (button not pressed on "go" in tegers). SART performance is 
associated with prefrontal cort ex functioning, has been found t o increase with mindfulness 
training and is correlated with scores on mindfulness questionn aires (specifically, the Mindful 
Attention Awareness Scale).

1. Provide a brief lay summary of the overall project. Include enough 
detail to allow the IRB to evaluate the requested change(s) within 
the context of the overall project.    
  
The World Health Organization reported that suboptimal blood pressure (BP) is responsible 
for more than half of cardiovascular disease mortality  world -wide.  Furthermore, greater than half 
of those with hypertension have uncontrolled BP.  A 2009 Institute of Medicine report 
recommended prioritizing research to “Compare the effectiveness of mindfulness -based 
interventions (e.g. yoga, meditation, deep breathing training) and usual care in treating… 
cardiovascular risk factors. ”  Evidence- based mindfulness interventions, including Mindfulness -
Based Stress Reduction, may have some effects on blood pressure, where a recent meta-
analysis and systematic review of [ADDRESS_537251] si zes (range 0 -5 mmHg). Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction 
(MBSR) has been customized to a number of disease processes, such as Mindfulness -Based 
Cognitive Therapy for patients with recurrent depression, and Mindfulness -Based Relapse 
Prevention for patients with substance use addictions.  Effect sizes have been increased by 
[CONTACT_424929]. The same may be true for hypertension,  however mindfulness interventions customized for prehypertensive/hypertensive 
patients have never been investigated.  Until methodologically rigorous studies to evaluate 
customized interventions for hypertension are performed, we will not know if the observed 
preliminary effects of general mindfulness interventions on blood pressure reduction could be 
much more effective with a tailored approach.  Consequently, we propose to conduct a stage I 
behavioral therapy intervention study to evaluate whether MBSR customized to prehypertensive 
and hypertensive patients has the potential to provide clinically relevant reductions in BP. Consequently the specific aims are:  
 
  
Stage 1a: Therapy Development/Manual Writing  
1. To outline and evaluate key novel elements of mindfulness -based hypertension therapy 
(MBHT), customized from the evidence- based MBSR.  We hypothesize that the most 
important novel element will be generation of mindfulness skills specifically applied to hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical activity, obesity, alcohol consumption 
and antihypertensive medication adherence.  This aim w ill be achieved using (1) focus 
groups of participants undergoing the MBHT behavioral intervention, (2) discussion with experts (including cardiologists, epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543], mindfulness experts, mindfulness 
intervention instructors) prior to, and following pi [INVESTIGATOR_424693], and 
(3) clinical judgment of the investigators performing the intervention.   
2. To determine effectiveness of MBHT on primary outcomes (systolic blood pressure, retention rates, recruitment rates, and adverse effects) and secondary outcomes 
(hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical activity, obesity, and antihypertensive medication adherence) in hypertension subgroups, specifically participants with (1) 
prehypertension, (2) controlled hypertension, and (3) uncontrolled hypertension. Initial 
decisions about the targeted sample based on hypertension status will be made.   
3. To develop an MBHT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424739], including procedures for 
training, supervising, and evaluating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Furthermore, acceptable therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424740]. The manual and training program will include themes 
such as specification of unique and common elements of MBHT  vs. other interventions, 
description of interventions excluded from MBHT, and specification of key treatment 
parameters such as frequency and duration of treatment, session length, topi[INVESTIGATOR_424752], sequence of sessions, as well as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424742]. The MBHT training will consist of a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34712], a formal didacti c 
training seminar, and at least one closely supervised training session.   
  
Stage Ib: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238]  
4. To determine whether a mindfulness -based hypertension therapy (MBHT) intervention, 
customized from the evidence- based MBSR, has promise to be an effective behavioral 
therapy for participants with hypertension and/or prehypertension. We will perform a 
randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_424753]. enhanced usual care control.  We 
hypothesize that MBHT will have adequate recruitment rates (≥10% of prehypertensive/hypertensive participants invited from physicians’ offices), fairly low 
drop out rates (<15%), and medium effect sizes (e.g. 5- 10 mmHg systolic BP) for 
reduction in blood pressure.   
 
  
These findings will provide publishable pi[INVESTIGATOR_424754] -term changes in blood pressure vs. usual care and 
active  control groups.  If proven effective, MBHT could be offered as a complementary program 
in the prehypertensive/hypertensive patient population that contributes to over half of the 
cardiovascular disease mortality  world -wide.

2. Provide a detailed description of the changes being requested (Use 
additional pages, if necessary):  
 
We would like to update the IRB on the following changes made to the overall study protocol, 
recruitment materials, and participant assessments … 
 
 Change in Study Name – We have changed the study name [CONTACT_18904] : “The Mindfulness-based 
Hypertension Therapy Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] (MBHT) ” to “The Mindfulne ss-Based Blood Pressure Reduction 
Study (MB-BP) ”.  The rationale behind this change is that the original study title was not 
completely accurate since the program is not exactly “therapy”, as much as it is a tailored 
intervention to see if participant’s bl ood pressure can be reduced over time.  The revision also 
reflects the fact that we are not only recruiting individuals with hypertension but those with 
prehypertension as well. 
 
 
 Revised NCCIH Safety Monitoring Protocol – the formal Safety Monitoring Protocol submitted 
to the NCCIH (a division of the NIH) was revised back o n November 26, 2015.  We have attached 
the updated version 1.3 here to be included as part of the study protocol (see Appendix 1 ).  
Under the NIH Safety Monitoring Protocol, we are required to check in with study participants 
regularly (at four week intervals) to assess if they have sustained any physical injuries.  Please 
see p.9-[ADDRESS_537253] relevant text below. 
 
Monitoring of Physical Injuries: All patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_425003], specifically the following questions: 
 
1. Have you sustained any physical injuries during the past four weeks? 
 
If yes, 
(a) Please describe the injury. 
(b) Please describe what happened to cause the injury. 
(c) Did this injury include: 
i. Broken bone(s)? yes/no 
ii. Lacerations requiring stiches? yes/no 
iii. Concussion? yes/no 
 
If injuries include any of the above (i – iii), it will be reported to Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee member [CONTACT_425146], MD, who is a practicing physician and 
researcher. He will advise on any follow-up needed. It will also be reported to the 
chair of the Data Safety Monitoring Board.  
 
 
 Baseline and Follow up Assessments (split into two visits) –  Instead of having participants 
come into the office once for their baseline and follow up assessments, we would like to have 
them come in on two separate occasions at about one week apart.  The reason behind this 
request is two-fold. First, participants will be asked to wear a Fitbit device, which will monitor 
their physical activity and sleep. The device will be worn for one week and will need to be 
returned to the office at the end of the week in order for the data to be synced and uploaded. 
By [CONTACT_425004], it will ensure that the Fitbit tracker is returned and 
that the data are properly uploaded.  The second reason for the return visit will be to allow the 
participant time to meet with the course instructor. This one- on-one meeting is already part of 
the mindfulness intervention.  It is important to note that, apart from participant travel to and 
from the office, we are not adding any additional time to the length of the baseline and follow 
up assessments but rather the assessment content has been divided across two separate visits. 
If a participant indicates that he/she is unable to come into the office for the second visit, we 
can allow the participant the option of mailing his/her Fitbit tracker back to the office with a 
prepaid envelope. 
 
 
 Change in Data Collection Mode for Daily Practice Forms and other Class questionnaires  – we 
would like to change the mode of administration by [CONTACT_425005]-course practice 
forms and questionnaires are able to be completed by [CONTACT_4317]. Currently, participants are 
asked to complete these forms on paper.  Moving forward we would like to allow participants 
the option to complete the course assignments online in Qualtrics. We would still allow 
participants the option to complete on paper if preferred. 
 
 
 Revised Study Recruitment Materials and Protocol – we have made revisions to our study 
advertisement material and protocol.  Below are details regarding these changes: 
 
Revised Flyers and Advertisement Cards – we have revised our study advertisement card 
and flyer.  See Appendix [ADDRESS_537254] and the flyer are the same, but that the print format is different (Appendix 3 
contains a clean version of each) . A summary of the changes as well as the justification for 
the revisions are below: 
 
Per feedback from a Graphic Designer at RISD, we have made the following 
modifications to our study advertisement materials: (1) Moved "Research Study" from 
title to explanatory paragraph to make more visually appealing. (2) Changed study 
phone number from PI's personal cell phone to a study cell phone paid for by [CONTACT_425006]. (3) Modified the descriptive 
language used to describe the study so that it is easier to read and is more specific and 
accurate. 
 
Facebook Page and Advertisements – we have created a study Facebook page and would 
like to begin using Facebook to recruit for the study. See Appendix 4 for screenshots from 
the study page. Note that we will wait for IRB approval before making this page public. 
 
Twitter Page – we have created a study twitter page, on which we can tweet about 
upcoming events (e.g., mindfulness courses). See Appendix 5 for a screenshots of our 
twitter account page (that can be made public once IRB approval has been received).  
 
Craigslist Advertisement – see Appendix [ADDRESS_537255] advertisement content. Note that 
the content is the same as that used for the advertisement cards. 
 
 
 NEW Study Webpage  – we have created two new MB-BP study webpages, which are found on 
the broader Mindfulness and Cardiovascular Health Lab websites.  The Mindfulness and 
Cardiovascular Health Lab is located at the Brown University School of Public Health’s Cent er for 
Population Health and Clinical Epi[INVESTIGATOR_424755]. Eric Loucks.  There are two 
websites for the Mindfulness and Cardiovascular Health Lab.  O ne is hosted through Brown’s 
domain and the other through an external website platform known as Weebly.  The MB-BP 
study is featured on both websites.  See Appendix 7 for screenshots and content from each of 
the websites. Note that these websites will not be publically launched until IRB approval has 
been received. 
 
Website URL’s are below:  
Brown University Site:  https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/blood-pressure-reduction/home  
Weebly webpage: http://mindfulnesscvlab.weebly.com/  
 
 
Revisions to the in-class worksheets and assessments – the following revisions have been made to the 
mindfulness course worksheets / assignments: 
 
Weeks 4 and 5: Goal Related to Diet, Alcohol Consumption, Physical Activity, or Stress 
Reaction/Response (v.1.1, Appendix 8)  – there were errors in the question variable names found in 
the tables on p.3-5. This was likely due to a cut and paste error. This has since been corrected. We 
have included a track changed version of Week 4 (Appendix 7).  Week [ADDRESS_537256] made changes to several of the individual assessments.  See 
below for details as well as Appendice s 9-12 for revised assessments with track changes) 
 
Phone Screener: (v.1.5, See Appendix 9) 
 Modified the language slightly to improve survey flow, ease of administration and to be more 
clear and concise about study involvement. 
 For other revisions - see  individual comments in attached screener document for detailed 
rationale on revisions 
 
In-Person Screening: (v.1.5, See Appendix 10) 
 Added in the Blood Pressure Safety Protocol, which is also reported to the NCCIH as part of the 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan.  
 For other revisions - see  individual comments in attached in-person screener document for 
detailed rationale on revisions  
 
In-Person Baseline Assessment (v.1.5, See Appendix 11) 
 Added in the Blood Pressure Safety Protocol, which is also reported to the NCCIH as part of the 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan.  
 To reduce participant burden we have dropped several of the variables collected on the Food 
Frequency Questionnaire. See marked up FFQ found within Appendix 10 for details on variables 
dropped. 
 We switched the order of administration for the ANT and SART. The SART is a better measure of 
attention, so it is important that it is completed first, in case the first measure has an effect on 
the outcome of the second measure completed.  
 For other revisions - see  individual comments in attached in-person baseline assessment for 
detailed rationale on revisions  
 
Home Baseline Assessment: (v.1.5, See Appendix 12) - The only revision to this assessment is th e 
addition of a scale known as the “self -efficacy for managing chronic disease questionnaire ”.  See the 
track changes document for details. 
 
Follow-Up Assessments – Follow-up assessments will take place at [ADDRESS_537257] 
baseline.  The follow-up assessments will be identical to those administered at baseline (Home and In-
Person), with the exception that any variables that are not expected to change over time (e.g., race-
ethnicity), will be removed in order to reduce participant burden.  We have listed the question items 
below that will NOT be included in the follow up assessments. The only additional measure during 
follow-up assessments is recording the amount of formal and informal mindfulness practices that 
participants are doing (see Appendix 13) .  
 
In-Person Assessment  – The in-person assessment used at baseline will be the same assessment 
used for all of the follow-ups. 
 
 
Home Assessment  – The variables found in the Home Baseline Questionnaire that will NOT be 
included in the follow up assessments are: 
 
PG1_01- 03 Personal goals 
BQ1_01- 03 Age, Race and Ethnicity 
BQ1_05- 08 Education, degree earned, technical/vocation schooling 
CS1_01- 04 Parents’ education  
CE1_01- 10 Childhood experiences 
FH1_01- 04 Family history of hypertension 
 
Measurement of Mindfulness Practices  – see Appendix [ADDRESS_537258] the amount of formal and informal mindfulness 
practices that participants are doing: 
 
 
 
3. State the reason (justification) for the requested amendment:   
  
Please see justifications in Section [ADDRESS_537259] the overall 
risk/benefit ratio of the study and the willingness of individuals to 
participate?   
  
The changes we have made in this amendment affect the risk/benefit ratio in small ways, and if 
anything, we anticipate the revisions will decrease participant burden.  We modified the study 
name [CONTACT_425123].  We moved around some of the 
questions in an attempt to improve the overall survey flow and spread out the overall time/effort 
burden on participants.  And although some new question items have been added to the 
assessments, we have also removed some items. We estimate, that the overall assessment 
time has not changed. 
 
The revisions to the formalized Safety Monitoring protocol help reduce participant risk by 
[CONTACT_424980]. 
 
  
5. Do
es the requested amendment require new documents or changes 
to the approved consent form or other documents?   
  
Yes. P
lease see Appendices 1-13.

1.1 Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design  
1.1.1 Involvement:  
Participants will be recruited in part through cardiology and family practices via established relationships 
with physicians in Rhode Island and [LOCATION_005], such as Cathleen Hood MD, Sam Dudley MD, Charles 
Eaton MD and Hank Wu MD, amongst others. Furthermore, advertisements will be posted throughout Rhode 
Island, and distributed via social media, inviting participants interested in lowering their blood pressure to enroll  
MBHT Intervention Description:  This study proposes to customize MBSR t o participants with 
prehypertension/hypertension creating an intervention called Mindfulness -Based Hypertension Therapy 
(MBHT). Specifically, MBHT is based on the standardized MBSR intervention described elsewhere,153-[ADDRESS_537263] investigating 
associations of mindfulness with cardiovascular health.
164,183,184 The unique areas of MBHT are expected to be 
education on hypertension risk factors, hypertension health effects, and specific mindfulness modules focused 
on awareness of diet, physical activity, medication adherence, alcohol consumption, stress, and social support 
for behavior change. A preliminary manual has been created based on the standardized MBSR manual 
developed at UMass Medical School ( Appendix A), and will be further developed through the approaches 
described above, and sequentially revised based on participant feedback and preliminary findings.155,156 MBHT 
sessions contain instruction and practice in mindfulness meditation, and conversations about stress and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Studen ts learn a range of mindfulness skills including body scan exercises, meditation and yoga. 
Homework consists of practicing skills for ≥45 min/day, 6 days/week.  
MBHT builds a foundation of mindfulness skills (e.g. meditation, self -awareness, etc.) through the MBSR 
curriculum. MBHT then directs attention towards hypertension risk factors. Early in the MBHT, the importance of hypertension for health and mortality is  described, along with hypertension risk factors. Participants will have 
their blood pressure and hypertension risk factors assessed at baseline, and be provided with this information 
during the first in- person MBHT session. This phase aims to engage parti cipants’ interest in hypertension risk 
factors, and increase motivation for behavior change. MBHT encourages participants to explore personal 
readiness for change in the different hypertension risk factors, and explore utilizing mindfulness practices to engage with those risk factors that they choose to. Each week, focus is provided on different hypertension risk 
factors. However, common themes exist across all hypertension risk factors including (1) awareness of 
thoughts, emotions and physical sensations p articularly surrounding hypertension risk factors such as 
overconsumption of palatable foods, sedentary activities, alcohol consumption, medication adherence; (2) 
craving, particularly for hypertension risk factors such as overconsumption of palatable foods, sedentary 
activities, and alcohol consumption; (3) the impact of bringing mindfulness to every moment, particularly in relation to hypertension risk factors. For example, when consuming highly palatable food, bringing awareness 
to the emotions, thoughts  and physical sensations prior to eating it, during eating it, along with the many 
minutes, if not hours, afterwards. Participants are trained to bring non -judgmental attention to the often short -
term pleasure of overconsumption of foods, sedentary activit ies, heavy alcohol consumption, or not taking 
medications, and bring non -judgmental attention to the longer term suffering associations with these activities. 
Through this process, participants are encouraged to reflect on if behavioral choices provide mor e benefit or 
harm to their well -being, and to choose the behaviors that bring benefit. (4) Self -care: as awareness of 
thoughts, emotions and physical sensations increases, and self -regulation will likely increases as a result of the 
meditation practices, t he curriculum will emphasize to participants that it is common for people to start caring 
for themselves more. It is a way of better knowing ourselves, and through knowing ourselves in in each 
Version 1.3 November 26 , 2015  2 moment, we often want to care for ourselves in each moment. Thi s may mean taking medication that will help 
our health, or being more physical active, eating more healthily, or consuming more moderate amounts of 
alcohol. The intervention can be modified to change the dose of any of these 4 components, for example via 
(1) Increased use of specific meditations focused on health behaviors such as diet and physical activity. (2) 
Increased use of mediations focused on craving. Participants will be trained to notice craving arising, and fading away in relation to hypertension  risk factors such as palatable high caloric foods, sedentary activities, 
and alcohol consumption. (3) Increased used of mindfulness practices related to long term experiences of health behaviors such as alcohol consumption, diet, physical activity and med ication use on thoughts, 
emotions, physical sensations and well -being. (4) Self -care: Increased use of modules that show how 
mindfulness practice increased self -awareness and in doing so can increase people’s desire to care for 
themselves. The potential us e of loving kindness meditation will be considered.  
MBSR Intervention Group:  MBSR consists of eight 2.[ADDRESS_537264] 500 hours of MBSR teaching experience, detailed further in Section [IP_ADDRESS] of  the Research Strategy. 
There are over [ADDRESS_537265] MBSR courses will improve generalizability of these findings compared to if only a small number of instructors were selected to teach 
MBSR to participants. MBSR instructor competency and treatment fidelity are further described below.  
MBHT and MBSR Competency and Treatment Fidelity: Treatment fidelity stra tegies will be performed in 
accordance with recommendations of the NIH Behavior Change consortium, specifically ensuring treatment 
fidelity in the following five areas: study design, training providers, delivery of treatment, receipt of treatment 
and enact ment of treatment skills,
240 as follows.  Study design : The study  will provide the same treatment dose 
for each participant enrolled in the MBSR and MBHT interventions, including fixed length and number of frequency of contact [CONTACT_425007]. All session durations will be recorded, and 
evaluated monthly by [CONTACT_425008]. Any deviations from the planned duration will be 
recorded. All class sessions will be audiotaped. [CONTACT_425137] [CONTACT_425009], using cla sses and sessions selected at random. [CONTACT_425138] and her 
team will conduct competency ratings on these tapes using validated adherence scales (MBCT Adherence Scale, where items [ADDRESS_537266]
241), and provide detailed feedback to 
treatment providers. We will ensure equivalent dose across conditions, including meditation, yoga and stress 
reduction training, through tracking the audio recordings. Possible setbacks in implementation of treatment wil l 
be addressed, including having a large pool of MBSR and MBHT instructors in the event that specific 
instructors no longer teach classes. Instructor attrition will be tracked.  
Provider training:  MBSR and MBHT will be performed by [CONTACT_424970]. MBSR teacher certification is 
fairly extensive, and accreditation occurs through the University of [LOCATION_005] Medical School Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society, detailed elsewhere.
242 Examples of criteria for becoming a 
certified MBSR teaching include (i) completion of an eight -week MBSR course as a participant, (ii) completion 
of several multi -day resident ial training courses in mindfulness based stress reduction practice and teaching, 
(iii) substantial experience in teaching MBSR, (iv) strong references letters from colleagues and participants who have taken your MBSR courses, (v) completion of several mul ti-day mindfulness meditation retreats, (vi) 
have a graduate degree in a field connected to MBSR (e.g. education, psychology, medicine) or demonstration of equivalent understanding through work experience in a related field. There are 89 registered MBSR programs in [LOCATION_005] (60), RI (9) and CT (20) that offer year- round program including the Center for 
Mindfulness where MBSR originated. Eligible programs must be [ADDRESS_537267] 
completed the MBSR Instructor certification training to participate in the study. Delivery of treatment : We will 
assess participants’ perceptions of provider warmth and credibility using brief measures based on the validated 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_537268], and measures of warmth and credibility will be adjusted for in sensitivity 
analyses, to evaluate if results differ  when these measures are included vs. excluded. Receipt of treatment and 
enactment of treatment skills: These will be assessed using the Mindfulness Skill Acquisition Scale,245 which 
assesses: (i) the frequency of how often participants apply strategies in their lives taught during MBSR and 
MBHT classes, and (ii) frequency by [CONTACT_425010][INVESTIGATOR_4262], such as 
mental /behavioral disengagement, substance use (e.g. smoking) and overeating.245 Participants’ meditation 
diaries, described in Section 5.4, will assess regularity of meditation practice.  
Phone -Based Screening: For people who indicate interest in the study, this screening will take place by 
[CONTACT_425011], with the exception of 
blood pressure which will be assessed in- person  
In-Person Screening:  If participants remain eligible after the phone -based screening, they will attend an in -
person screening for blood pressure and medication assessment. If mean blood pressure shows hypertension/prehypertension (≥120 mmHg systolic, ≥80 mmHg diastolic pressure or taking antihypertensive medication), participants will be invited to return for a second blood pressure reading. At that time, if the mean blood pressure across both assessment times is ≥120 mmHg systolic, ≥80 mmHg diastolic pressure, they will 
be inv ited to participate in the study.

(28) Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI):  In the UH3 phase only, if secondary data analyses 
during the UH2 phase indicate evidence of neuroimaging -based measures of self -regulation being 
important mechanisms, participants in the UH3 phase will undergo an MRI scanning session for approximately [ADDRESS_537271] is in the resting state. Sample size will be 24 per group. Participants will undergo a 
separate consent form for fMRI imaging, so that they can be in the MBHT study without imaging if they 
prefer.  
 
Follow -Up A ssessments at 10 Weeks and 6 Months Follow -Up: Questionnaires and assessments 
administered at [ADDRESS_537272] in -person 
screening assessment and at baseline, with the exception that questionnaires for which the answers should 
not change or be informative (age, race/ethnicity, education, adverse childhood experiences, family history of 
hypertension) are not given at follow -ups. In addition adverse events are monitored at both the 10 week and 6 
month follow -up period. We ar e also exploring performing a 1 -year follow -up to enhance understanding of 
longer term target engagement. However due to the relatively brief period of time for the UH2 phase, the 6 month follow -up time is the primary endpoint for decisions on target engagement . In addition adverse events 
are monitored at all follow -up assessments.  
Focus Groups:  Focus group assessments of experts (including cardiologists, epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543], mindfulness 
experts, mindfulness intervention instructors) will occur prior to, and following pi[INVESTIGATOR_424758]. Focus groups of participants undergoing the MBHT behavioral intervention will take place 
following the final week of class. The goal of the focus groups will be to adapt MBHT to the unique needs of 
this population. Adaptions may include, for example, types of specific mindfulness exercises, sequence in 
which modules are introduced, relative emph asis on different types of modules (e.g. mindfulness practices 
customized to prehypertension/hypertension risk factors vs. general mindfulness practices), and class duration. 
Focus groups will be facilitated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Melissa Clark, who is an experienced focu s group moderator, along with 
another team member present to assist and take notes. The groups will be held in comfortable and convenient meeting rooms at the Brown University School of Public Health.  
We will follow study procedures similar to those perfo rmed during previous epi[INVESTIGATOR_424759]. In- person screenings will take place at the Brown University Center for Population Health and Clinical 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], described in Sections 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 at baseline, completion of  the 8 -week MBHT c ourse and 
at 6-months follow -up. Major assessment variables are shown in Table 1.  Qualitative interviews (focus groups) 
will evaluate participants’ experiences such as usefulness of specific modules, duration of sessions, time 
burden, and overall intervent ion effectiveness. Interviewer training includes high standards for selection of 
interviewers who are at ease with strangers, are culturally -sensitive and able to readily establish professional 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_537273] monthly to evaluate 
accuracy of technique, 
particularly for anthropometry and blood pressure assessment. Re -training will be 
implemented if needed. Data will be entered and cleaned in an ongoing matter to facilitate 
quality control and preliminary 
analyses.  
1.1.2 Inclusion/exclusion 
criteria:  
Inclusion Criteria:  
Hypertension/prehypertension 
(≥120 mmHg systolic, ≥80 
mmHg diastolic pressure or 
taking antihypertensive medication). Able to speak, 
read, and write in English. All 
adults (≥18 years of age), genders and racial/ethnic groups are eligible to be 
included.  
Exclusion Criteria:  Exclusion criteria follow standard guidelines and recommendations:
3 (a) current regular 
meditation practice (>once/week); (b) serious medical illness pre cluding regular class attendance; (c) current 
substance abuse, suicidal ideation or eating disorder, (d) history of bipolar or psychotic disorders or self -
injurious behaviors. These participants are excluded because they may disrupt group participation, re quire 
additional or specialized treatment, or are already participating in practices similar to the intervention.  
1.1.3 Vulnerable populations:  
There are no participants in the study we are aware of who are considered part of a vulnerable population.  
1.1.4 Collaborating sites:  
There are no other collaborating sites that will assess participants during this study.  
1.1.5 Data management:  
The clinical data will be de -identified but linked. Private information such as name [CONTACT_156241], next of kin, 
address for recontact[CONTACT_424917] a password protected, encrypted database on a different disk that the clinical data. Only the principal investigators for the purposes of patient safety or monitoring by [CONTACT_18121], data 
safety monitoring boards or HIPPA compliance officer approved agents will be given access to identifiable 
personal information.  
1.1.6 Equipoise  
Clinical equipoise, defined as “no consensus within the expert clinical community about the comparative 
merits of the alternative [trial arms] to be tested”
[ADDRESS_537274] of a stress reduction program on risk for cardiovascular 
disease. The statements in the study description and consent forms will show equipoise (i.e. “a state of 
genuine uncertainty on the part of the clinical investigator regarding the comparative therapeutic merits of each 
arm in a trial”138), where the state of the research does not know conclusively know whether the stress -
reduction program will have an effect on subclinical cardiovascular disease (hence we are performing the trial). For example, the consent form  will describe that is not currently known whether the stress reduction 
intervention we are testing reduces cardiovascular disease risk.  Similarly, all study personnel including the PI [INVESTIGATOR_424760], regardless of personal biases (in either 
direction – favoring treatment or control), so that any types of biases on treatment effects will not be 
communicated to study participants. Instruction will be provided for all study personnel on the importance  of 
demonstrating equipoise. Further instruction will be provided on ways to distinguish appropriately among (1) validated knowledge accepted by [CONTACT_425014], (2) data on treatments that are promising but are not 
generally convincing, and (3) mere hunches, including how these principles apply to the current study.

1.3 Potential Risks and Minimization of Risk  
1.3.1 Expected Risks  
The following is a statement from NCCIH about the potential risks of meditation practice: “Meditation is 
considered to be safe for healthy people. There have been rare reports that meditation could cause or worsen 
symptoms in people who have certain psychiatric problems, but this question has not been fully researched. 
People with physical limitations may not be able to parti cipate in certain meditative practices involving physical 
movement. Individuals with existing mental or physical health conditions should speak with their health care 
providers prior to starting a meditative practice and make their meditation instructor aware of their condition.”
235  
Discomfort during meditation:  Meditation -based interventions may results in discomfort with attention to 
unpleasant thoughts, feelings or body sensations. Some individuals may experience an initial increase  in 
undesirable emotions with increased attention to them. In order to minimize risk, instructors encourage participants to be aware of their discomfort and to set their own limitations. Participants are encouraged to alter 
their postures, including standi ng, sitting in chairs, lying down, as needed in order to be comfortable. In 
addition, the curriculum of the training program is specifically geared towards addressing such discomfort.  
Psychological distress:  Research subjects participating in this study m ay have feelings of loss of privacy 
from being contact[CONTACT_424893], and possible psychological distress caused by [CONTACT_424894]. However, the resulting potential for injury 
to research subjects is judged to be minimal.  We have already contact[CONTACT_425017]’s Health Initiative using similar assessment procedures to this study, with good responses from the participants. With regard to psychological distress from taking part in the MBSR or MBHT intervention, given that screening questions will exclude 
participants with substantial mental illness, and given the NCCIH statement  above that “Meditation is 
considered to be safe for healthy people.”
[ADDRESS_537278] , will be available to advise on any psychological events that 
occur, and provide referrals for treatment if needed.  
Loss of confidentiality:  Likelihood: rare. Minimization: Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_412039], by [CONTACT_46767], and by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_46741].  All 
information obtained from participants will be accessible only to research staff.  
Injury due to physical activities: It is possible that injuries could be sustained from (1) the gentle mindful 
movements (yoga), or (2) physical activities that participants engage in as a result of the intervention 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_537279] to reduce blood pressure.  (1) Mindful movements: 
Participants receive a handout during the orientation showing the yoga poses that will be offered during the 
course. They are encouraged to explore limits in their body related to movement, but not to go beyond those 
limits Participants are asked to listen to what their body is telling them more closely than what the mindful 
movement instructor is telling them. Mod ifications of poses are available, including for those limited to chairs or 
wheelchairs. Participants are encouraged to bring the handout of poses to their health care providers if they 
have any physical limitations, so that the providers can advise on whi ch poses to do, and which to avoid.  (2) 
Physical activities:  Participants are encouraged to explore physical activities that promote strength and 
conditioning as a way to reduce blood pressure. As with the mindful movements, they are encouraged to explore limits in their body related to movement, but not to go beyond those limits . Participants are asked to 
listen to what their body is telling them more closely than what the mindful movement instructor is telling them.  
Furthermore, they are encouraged to ask their healthcare provider about advised physical activities if they 
have any physical limitations.  
Risks associated with fMRI:  This study will be conducted in a 3T MR scanner at UMass Medical School, 
which has been approved for research and clinical stud ies in children and adults by [CONTACT_1622]. Magnetic 
resonance (MR) technology does not use X -rays, it uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves. Subjects will 
be asked whether they have devices that can be affected by [CONTACT_9268], and if so, they will not be able to  participate 
in this study. Significant risks also can arise if ferromagnetic materials are brought into the high magnetic field 
environment of the scanner and immediate vicinity, as they can become hazardous projectiles. These types of 
items are not permi tted in the scanning area. The MR exams are painless, and except for the pulsating 
sounds, subjects will not be aware that MR scanning is taking place. With proper safety precautions in terms of 
the avoidance of metal objects, there are no known health ris ks associated with MRI. The safety of MRI is 
reflected in the fact that it is used in standard medical practice without the requirement for informed patient consent. Most people experience no ill effects from the magnetic field, but some report claustropho bia, 
dizziness, mild nausea, headaches, a metallic taste in their mouth, double vision, or a sensation of flashing lights. These symptoms are transient and resolve quickly after the subject exits the scanner. The technologist 
will be able to hear subjects at all times and subjects are free to end the procedure at any time. In rare cases, a 
very slight, uncomfortable tingling of the back due to the rapid switching of the magnetic field has been 
reported during certain types of scans. Subjects are asked to re port this immediately so the scan can be 
changed to avoid this. Although these precautions will avoid all known risks associated with MR, this procedure may involve risks that are currently unknown. The scanner is noisy, but does not harm hearing. For comf ort, 
subjects will be given earplugs to muffle the noise.  
Risk of adverse events during the study:  It is possible that some patients will have an adverse event during 
the study, including increased stress or anxiety. Participants with major mental health c onditions, such as 
bipolar depression, suicidal ideation, borderline personality disorder, post -traumatic stress disorder, and 
obsessive compulsive disorder, are ineligible for the study. We expect risk of adverse events to be very low.  
Impact statement: These risks are considered to be minimal and are addressed in the protocol and consent 
form.  
 
Adverse Events  Mental Health Deterioration and Suicidality:  Participants assigned to any treatment group may experience 
mental health or suicidal ideation.  All patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_425018], depression and suicidal 
ideation, specifically the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_424763] (CESD- R). [CONTACT_425139] is a licensed psychiatrist and has extensive experience evaluating research

 Injury due to physical activities: It is possible that injuries could be sustained from (1) the gentle mindful 
movements (yoga), or (2) physical activities that participants engage in as a result of the intervention encouraging exploration of physical activity as a way to reduce blood pressure.  
Version 1.3 November 26 , 2015  10  
(1) Mindful movements: Participants receive a handout durin g the orientation showing the yoga poses that 
will be offered during the course. They are encouraged to explore limits in their body related to 
movement, but not to go beyond those limits Participants are asked to listen to what their body is telling them more closely than what the mindful movement instructor is telling them. Modifications of poses are 
available, including for those limited to chairs or wheelchairs. Participants are encouraged to bring the 
handout of poses to their health care providers if they have any physical limitations, so that the 
providers can advise on which poses to do, and which to avoid.  
(2) Physical activities: Participants are encouraged to explore physical activities that promote strength and conditioning as a way to reduce blood p ressure. As with the mindful movements, they are encouraged 
to explore limits in their body related to movement, but not to go beyond those limits . Participants are 
asked to listen to what their body is telling them more closely than what the mindful movement instructor is telling them.  Furthermore, they are encouraged to ask their healthcare provider about 
advised physical activities if they have any physical limitations.  
 
All patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_425021] t elephone and assessed every 
four weeks with questionnaires about physical injuries, specifically the following questions:  
 
1. Have you sustained any physical injuries during the past  four weeks?  
 If yes,  
(a) please describe the injury  
(b) please describe what happened to cause the injury.  
(c) did this injury include  
i. Broken bone(s) yes/no  
ii. Lacerations requiring stiches yes/no  
iii. Concussion yes/no  
 
If injuries include any of the following, it will be reported to  Data Safety Monitoring Commi ttee member [CONTACT_425152], MD,  who is a practicing physician and researcher. He will advise on any follow -up needed. It will 
also be reported to the  chair of the Data Safety Monitoring Board.  
 
a. Broken bone(s)  
b. Lacerations requiring stiches  
c. Concussion  
 
Non-Response to Treatment : The possibility that the treatment will not yield benefit is another possible risk and 
will be explained during informed consent procedures. Non -responders (identified as minimal change in 
medical regimen adherence from baseline assessm ent) will be provided with referrals to other treatment, if 
desired.  
 
1.4 Safety Monitoring   
Oversight of internal monitoring of the participants’ safety will be conducted by [CONTACT_7676], [CONTACT_425141] and

NIH along with any changes or amendments to the protocol requested by [CONTACT_425026].  
Proposed changes or amendments to the protocol in general must be requested first in writing to the Brown and IRB, which will then grant or deny permission to make the requested change or amendment in protocol. NIH will subsequently be inform ed of any substantive changes or amendments in approved protocol.   
5.5 Data Quality Assurance and Confidentiality  
Several procedures currently in practice in our laboratory will also be utilized for this study to guarantee the 
validity, integrity, accuracy, a nd completeness of the data.  It will be made clear to all participants that all 
information obtained during assessments is confidential.   
Procedures to guarantee the accuracy and completeness of the data during data collection, transmission, 
and analysis : The data manager ( Saadeh ) will review each file within [ADDRESS_537295]’s data managers , the biostatistician, and the PI.   
Procedures  to maintain confidentiality:  Study staff will maintain strict confidentiality regarding all aspects of 
a subject’s participation in this study. Any individual information gathered in the course of the study will not be 
discussed with anyone who is not directly involved with this study. For each stage of the research, participant 
names and contact [CONTACT_425027] a recruitment/enrollment database during the course of the study.  Once individuals enroll in the study, names will be linked to  participant ID number in this database, 
which will be kept in a restricted access folder on a secure server.  This file will be assigned a code name [CONTACT_274629].  Signed consent forms will be kept in a locked file cabinet, separate from 
any other project data.  Once data collection is completed, the corresponding recruitment/enrollment database 
will be deleted as it is unnecessary to maintain the link between participant identity and study data.  All 
information collected as part of this study will be accessible only to research staff who have completed 
mandatory training in the protection of human subjects.   
[ADDRESS_537296] is 
enrolled. Reporting of results (including adverse events) will occur no later than 1 year after completion date.

Great. There are a few things that I would like to go over  before we start the interview. 
First, some of the questions that I will ask now to figure out if you are eligible to be in 
this study will be of personal nature, including asking about your mental health and life’s 
experiences.  
 
SQ09 . Are you in a private place to talk?  
 
[If yes, proceed to text below. If no, reschedule meeting using variables SQ06 and SQ07 above].  
 
 Because this interview is of a personal nature, it is important that you understand that 
everything you say will be kept strictly confidential.  No one outsi de of our project will 
ever be able to see your answers, and we will not keep your name [CONTACT_425106]. If you are not eligible after the phone screen, we will destroy your

During the phone -based screening, if participants respond yes to “Are you currently suicidal?”, 
the interviewer should perform the following 2 steps:  
 
1. Immediately have [ADDRESS_537390] a study participant on the phone who is currently suicidal. Please call 911 
immediately, and tell them:  
 
“I am calling on behalf of [my name] who is performing a research study at Brown 
University.  He has a participant on the phone who says they are currently suicidal.” 
Please provide the participants’ contact [CONTACT_424926] 911 operator (i.e. name, 
address, phone #, email address) as requested. This information is  shown  above.  
 
Finally, after calling 911, please call [CONTACT_425136], who is the psychiatrist supporting 
this study. Her cell phone # is 401- 258-9829. Please provide her with the same 
information as was done during the 911 call.  
 
2. While speaking calmly with the participant, let them know what you are doing. 
Specifically, let them know we are calling our study’s psychiatrist [CONTACT_425139] and 911, and why you are doing that (i.e. because we are concerned about you). You can speak with participant to keep him/her on the phone, but the discussion should not be 
clinical in nature.

Deleted: December 21, 2015After questionnaires are complete, participants will be asked to perform the following two 
computer -based tests:  
Sustained Attention to Response Task (15 minutes)  
 
The Sustained Attention to Response Task ( SART ) is a computerized test of sustained 
attention, response inhibition (executive function) and self -regulation.  Subjects are instructed to 
press a key in response to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_358968] (1- 9) and withhold response to a 
designated "no- go" integer.  SART errors consist of summed commission errors (button press on 
no-go trial) and omission errors (button not pressed on "go" integers). SART performance is 
associated with prefrontal cortex functioning, has been found to increase with mindfulness 
training and is correlated with scores on mindfulness questionnaires (specifically, the Mindful 
Attention Awareness Scale).  
 
Attention Control: Attention Network Test  (20 minutes)  
 
Attention Network Test (ANT)  is a brief computerized battery measuring three independent 
behavioral components of attention: Conflict resolution (ability to overcome distracting stimuli), 
spatial Orienting (the benefit of valid spatial pre- cues), and Alerting (the benefit of temporal  pre-
cues). Efficiency of orienting is examined by [CONTACT_424989]. The efficiency of the executive conflict resolution network is examined by [CONTACT_424990] (left 
or right) of a central arrow surrounded by [CONTACT_424979], incongruent or neutral flankers. Moderate 
to high reliabilities are found for all networks . 
 
ANT data to be entered by [CONTACT_425048]:

  Moved  (insertion)  [1]Comment [SF7]: We switched the order of 
administration for the ANT and SART. The 
SART is a better measure of attention, so it is important that it is completed first, in case the 
first measure has an effect on the outcome of 
the second measure completed.

1. Provide a brief lay summary of the overall project. Include enough 
detail to allow the IRB to evaluate the requested change(s) within 
the context of the overall project.   
  
The World Health Organization reported that suboptimal blood pressure (BP) is responsible 
for more than half of cardiovascular disease mortality world-wide. Furthermore, greater than half 
of those with hypertension have uncontrolled BP. A 2009 Institute of Medicine report 
recommended prioritizing research to “Compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based 
interventions (e.g. yoga, meditation, deep breathing training) and usual care in treating… 
cardiovascular risk factors.”  Evidence-based mindfulness interventions, including Mindfulness-
Based Stress Reduction, may have some effects on blood pressure, where a recent meta -
analysis and systematic review of [ADDRESS_537444] sizes (range 0-5 mmHg). Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction 
(MBSR) has been customized to a number of disease processes, such as Mindfulness-Based 
Cognitive Therapy for patients with recurrent depression, and Mindfulness-Based Relapse 
Prevention for patients with substance use addictions. Effect sizes have been increased by 
[CONTACT_424929]. The same may be true for 
hypertension, however mindfulness interventions customized for prehypertensive/hypertensive 
patients have never been investigated.  Until methodologically rigorous studies to evaluate 
customized interventions for hypertension are performed, we will not know if the observed 
preliminary effects of general mindfulness interventions on blood pressure reduction could be 
much more effective with a tailored approach.  Consequently, we propose to conduct a stage I 
behavioral therapy intervention study to evaluate whether MBSR customized to prehypertensive 
and hypertensive patients has the potential to provide clinically relevant reductions in BP. 
Consequently the specific aims are:  
  
Stage 1a: Therapy Development/Manual Writing   
1. To outline and evaluate key novel elements of mindfulness-based hypertension therapy 
(MBHT), customized from the evidence-based MBSR. We hypothesize that the most 
important novel element will be generation of mindfulness skills specifically applied to 
hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical activity, obesity, alcohol consumption 
and antihypertensive medication adherence.  This aim will be achieved using (1) focus 
groups of participants undergoing the MBHT behavioral intervention, (2) discussion with 
experts (including cardiologists, epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543], mindfulness experts, mindfulness 
intervention instructors) prior to, and following pi[INVESTIGATOR_424693], and 
(3) clinical judgment of the investigators performing the intervention.   
2. To determine effectiveness of MBHT on primary outcomes (systolic blood pressure, 
retention rates, recruitment rates, and adverse effects) and secondary outcomes 
(hypertension risk factors such as diet, physical activity, obesity, and antihypertensive 
medication adherence) in hypertension subgroups, specifically participants with (1) 
prehypertension, (2) controlled hypertension, and (3) uncontrolled hypertension. Initial 
decisions about the targeted sample based on hypertension status will be made.  
3. To develop an MBHT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424739], including procedures for 
training, supervising, and evaluating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Furthermore, acceptable therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424740]. The manual and training program will include themes 
such as specification of unique and common elements of MBHT vs. other interventions, 
description of interventions excluded from MBHT, and specification of key treatment 
parameters such as frequency and duration of treatment, session length, topi[INVESTIGATOR_424741], sequence of sessions, as well as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424742]. The MBHT training will consist of a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_34712], a formal didacti c 
training seminar, and at least one closely supervised training session.  
  
Stage Ib: Pi
[INVESTIGATOR_4238]   
4. To determine whether a mindfulness-based hypertension therapy (MBHT) intervention, 
customized from the evidence-based MBSR, has promise to be an effective behavioral 
therapy for participants with hypertension and/or prehypertension. We will perform a 
randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_424697]. enhanced usual care control. We 
hypothesize that MBHT will have adequate recruitment rates (≥10% of 
prehypertensive/hypertensive participants invited from physicians’ offices), fairly low 
drop out rates (<15%), and medium effect sizes (e.g. 5-10 mmHg systolic BP) for 
reduction in blood pressure.   
  
These findings will provide publishable pi[INVESTIGATOR_424714]-term changes in blood pressure vs. usual care and 
active  control groups. If proven effective, MBHT could be offered as a complementary program 
in the prehypertensive/hypertensive patient population that contributes to over half of the 
cardiovascular disease mortality world-wide.   
  
 
  
 
2. Provide a detailed description of the changes being requested (Use 
additional pages, if necessary):  
 
We are requesting the following changes … 
 
 Addition of two new questions to the Home Baseline Assessment – We would like to add two 
new  questions about hypertension (BP1_1 and BP 1_2) to the home baseline assessment (see 
attached pdf with track changes).  Please note that these questions would be administered 
during the Home Baseline assessment only.  Howev er, for participants who have already 
completed the baseline questionnaire, we would capture this information during their next 
follow up assessment. 
 
 
 Permission to provide financial compensation to participants who withdrew from the study 
intervention but are still willing to complete follow up assessments – since the start of our 
study, we have had two participants who have decided to withdraw from the study after the 
start of the intervention. We would be interested in re-contact[CONTACT_425052] $50 per follow up as an expression of gratitude for their time and 
effort. 
 
 
3. State the reason (justification) for the requested amendment:   
  
Please s
ee justifications in Section [ADDRESS_537445] the overall 
risk/benefit ratio of the study and the willingness of individuals to 
participate?   
  
We do not anticipate any
 major changes to the risk/benefit rati o.  Both of the new baseline 
questions are yes/ no and take well under a minute to complete. Following up with participants 
who withdrew from the intervention about the possibility of completing the follow ups does n ot 
cause any significant additional risks. Study staff will be trained to remind participants that their 
participation is voluntary. Some individuals may have withdrawn from the study because of 
reasons related to their ability to complete the 9 week course, but may actually still be interested 
in participating in the research questionnaires. This would allow them that opportunity. 
 
  
 
5. Does the requ
ested amendment require new documents or changes 
to the approved consent form or other documents?   
  
Yes.  
Changes to the Home Baseline Assessment (two new questions).  See attached 
document with track changes – only p.43 was affected and is being attached.

Project update as of November  2017 : 
The Mindfulness -Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB -BP) Study, formerly known as 
Mindfulness -Based Hypertension Therapy (MBHT), is currently in Year [ADDRESS_537448]  has ended and analysis is on -going. In total we ran 
three separate Mindfulness -Based Blood Pressure reduction (MB -BP) intervention courses, with 
a total sample size of 43 eligible participants who both enrolled and completed the  9-week  
intervention. We had eight eligible participants en roll in the study who later dec ided to not 
complete the course . 
 
In June 2017 we began enrollment for the next phase (referenced as Stage 1b above, but now 
called ‘ Stage 2a ’) of the study, which is  to conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with 
enhanced usual care . This phase will continue for the next [ADDRESS_537449] with an active  control ( i.e., Mindfulness -Based 
Stress Reduction  - MBSR ) as well as ambulatory blood pressure mo nitoring.   
 
  
2. Provide a detailed description of the changes being requested (Use 
additional pages, if necessary):  
 
This amendment covers the following  four requests:  
 
(1) Qualitative Phone Interviews  - First , we are requesting permission to modify the already 
approved focus group discussion questions into a one -on-one qualitative phone interview (see 
enclosed “Semi -structured qualitative phone interview”).  Our intent is to then randomly select 
and re-contact [CONTACT_37325] 1 participants, who did not participate in the focus group discussions, and 
invite them to take part in the one-on-one qualitative phon e interviews instead .  We would 
attempt to complete ten interviews. Participants who complete the phone interviews wo uld be 
mailed $25 gift cards for their time and effort.   Related enclosures: Appendices 1 -3 
 
(2) 2-year Follow Ups  – Second, we would like to re -contact [CONTACT_425053] a quick two year in -person assessment.  This 
optional assessment is estimated to take 20 -30 minutes to complete and would be a small sub-
set of what is already approved by [CONTACT_1201] (i.e., blood pressure, weight, hypertension 
medication questions, and mindfulness practice questions). Participants would be given $[ADDRESS_537450] us permission to do so.  Related enclosures: 
Appendices 3 -4 
 
(3) Participa nt Compensation  – Third, we are requesting permission to alter the order in which 
participants are compensated. As it is currently written, participants are given $25, $25, and $50 
USD at their 10 week, 6 month and 12 month follow ups respectively.  We are  seeking to reverse 
that order and instead provide participants $50, $25, and $25 USD at their three follow ups. The 
total amount provided as compensation for participation would remain the same ($100 USD). 
Participants already enrolled into the study woul d be compensated in the manner already 
outlined and approved. However, we are proposing that newly enrolled participants would be 
compensated under the new guidelines  outlined  in this amendment  (if approved) . See p.1 of the 
revise d consent form for this ch ange.  Related enclosure(s): Appendix 3  
 
(4) Recruitment assistance for UMass fMRI sub -study – the MB -BP Study is one of several 
concurrent studies being funded under the NCCIH Science of Behavior Change UH2 project 
“Mindfulness Influences on Self -Regulation: M ental and Physical Health Implications.”  Our 
collaborators at the UMass medical school have recently received IRB approval from the UMass 
Medical School IRB to conduct a related clinical trial that involves fMRI imaging  of MB -BP 
participants  to evaluate se veral mechanistic self -regulation targets of the Mindfulness -based 
blood pressure therapy (MB -BP), their neural substrates, and their potential impact on 
autonomic system measures . Their prop osed project  (titled, Mindful Self -Regulation for blood 
pressure MRI study ) involves recruiting, screening, enrolling, and scanning a sub -set of MB -BP 
participants  (i.e., goal is to enroll and image 60 eligible MB -BP participants over the 12 -18 
months). Eligible participants who agree to take part in the fMRI study at U Mass Medical School 
will be invited to travel up to the UMass facility twice – once at baseline and once at the 10 
week follow up  period – to undergo two MRI sessions (~1.5 hours each). Participants will be 
compensated $150 USD for each neuroimaging sessio n. Note: see attached UMass Medical 
School IRB submission for the full version of their study protocol, informed consent form, phone 
screener, and IRB approval letter.  
 
In this amendment we are requesting permission to approach newly enrolled MB -BP 
partici pants about the UMass Medical School fMRI study and to see if they would be interested 
in being contact[CONTACT_425054] a brief [ADDRESS_537451] udy.  To do this, 
Brown University research staff would use the attached “UMass Medical School fMRI Study 
Recruitment Talking Points” document. This document outlines the main features of the 
neuroimaging study and what participant involvement would entail. However, it is important to 
note that both the screening and the informed consent procedures will be con ducted by [CONTACT_425055]. Our role will be to introduce the 
fMRI study to our MB -BP participants and document their consent for UMass Medical School 
staff to contact [CONTACT_425056].  We will onl y provide UMass Medical School 
research staff with the contact [CONTACT_425057] -BP participants who agree to be contact[CONTACT_425058]. Contact [CONTACT_425057] -BP participants who do not wish 
to be contact[CONTACT_425059].  Related enclosures: Appendices 5 -6 
 
 
 
3. State the reason (justification) for the requested amendment:   
  
(1) The data collected in the proposed qualitative phone interviews will complement the qualitative 
data previously collected in the focus grou p discussions. It will also hopefully help to address any 
potential selection bias due to the more engaged and enthusiastic participants opting to take 
part in the focus group discussions.   
 
(2) Analysis of the one year follow up data has been very promising, showing sustained reductions 
in blood pressure and other important outcomes. There are very few research studies that 
explore sustained effects at [ADDRESS_537452] 
them complete a 2 year follow up would offer n ovel research findings to the field of mindfulness 
and cardiovascular health.  
 
(3) We are proposing a change in the compensation protocol for two reasons. First, we believe that 
providing participants the larger sum for the first follow up rather than the last  follow up will 
help with retention rates overall. We have often struggled to get participants to come in for the 
first follow up, particularly with members of the control group, who did not get the intervention. 
However, we have not had as much difficulty  getting participants to complete their final follow 
up. We find that once individuals have already invested time to complete the first two follow 
ups, they are often intrinsically motivated to complete the final follow up and therefore don’t 
require as mu ch external motivation to participate. The second justification for altering the 
payment structure is that the 12 month data are not as important to the overall study and 
analyses as the 10 week data are.  
 
(4) The UMass Medical School Mindful Self -Regulation f or blood pressure MRI study  is a related 
concurrent study on the same UH2 grant that is funding MB -BP.  Since it involves recruiting a 
sub-set of MB -BP participants it makes the most sense for the research staff at Brown University 
to be the individuals to  recruit.   
 
  
4. What  is your assessment of how the changes will affect the overall 
risk/benefit ratio of the study  and the willingness of individuals to 
participate?   
  
We do not anticipate any shifts in the risk / benefit ra tio of the study. Participation  in all aspects 
of the study is optional and will be explicitly stated at the time of recruitment and informed 
consent. This includes when approaching participants about potential involvement in the one on 
one qualitative phone interviews, 2 y ear follows ups, and possible participation in the fMRI 
study.  
 
 
  
5. Does the requested amendment require new documents or changes 
to the approved consent  form or other documents?

Agreement to Participate in a Research Study  
 
Investigation of the Effects of Mindfulness on Blood Pressure and Well -Being  
 
You are being asked to take part in a Brown University research study about the effects of 
mindfulness and hypertension education on blood pressure and risk factors for hypertension. 
This form will explain the purpose of the study, how the study will be ca rried out and what you 
will be expected to do.  It will also explain the possible risks and possible benefits of being in the 
study.  If any part of the following description is not clear to you, you are encouraged to contact 
[CONTACT_425063] q uestions before you decide whether to take part in the study. If you 
decide to participate, please fill out and sign the last page of this form.  
 
1a.  Nature and Purpose of the Study       
The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of mindfulness  practices and health 
education on blood pressure. You have been selected for this study because you expressed 
interest in the project  and because you met entrance criteria for having prehypertension or 
hypertension, or another cardiovascular risk factor t hat could be influenced by [CONTACT_424896].  
Eligibility for the study is still being a ssessed. T herefore, it is possible you may not be eligible 
for the study even after signing this consent form. Your participation in this study is voluntary 
and can be withd rawn at any point in the project.  
 
In order to a ssess the effects of the customized mindfulness intervention , you will be asked to 
complete some questionnaires and laboratory assessment s before and after the intervention. 
Specifically, assessments will be completed at: baseline, 10 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. To 
express our gratitude for participation, you will be given $ 2550, $25, and $ 50 25 (up to $100 
USD total) at the 10 week, 6 month and 12 month follow ups respectively. As part of the study 
you will also be given a wireless blood pressure monitor (estimated value of $90) to use 
throughout the study . There is an optional 2 year follow up t hat you may be invited to complete, 
for which you will be given an additional $50 USD.  
 
This is a Randomized Control Trial. Participants enrolled into the study will be randomly 
assigned to one of two groups: (1) the intervention group or (2) the wait -list control group. The 
wait-list control group will be given the opportunity to participa te in the intervention after  the six 
month follow up assessments are completed.   Both the intervention and the control group will be 
asked to participate in the research assessments.  
 
 
1b.   Explanation of Procedures   
 
If you agree to participate, you wil l be asked to consent to the following:  
 
1) Participat ion in an interview in which you will be asked questions about past and present 
mental health, including depression and suicide  (previously completed with your verbal 
consent) . 
 
MB-BP Stage 2a - Consent Form, Version 2.2, October 11 January, 2, 2018    Page 2 of 9 2) Completion of an in -person  screening assessment, during which your blood pressure, height, 
weight and other basic demographic and health data will be collected and assessed in order to 
determine eligibility for the study.  
 
3) Complet ion of questionnaires administered in -person and online that ask about a wide range 
of topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], including your diet, physical activity, smoking, medication use, personality, 
emotions, attention and past experiences, including stressful or traumatic experiences. These 
questions w ill probe sensitive psychological areas, including physical, emotion and sexual 
abuse. These questionnaires may take up to [ADDRESS_537456] the right not to answer any of the questions.  
 
4) Directly assessed blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight, physical activity, and 
antihypertensive (blood pressure) medication use  at baseline and after the mindfulness 
course . Physical activity will be assessed for a week at a time using small actigraphy 
monitors (i.e., Fitbits) that attach to your wrist. If you take antihypertensive medication, we 
will provide you with an electronic bottle cap that will automatically record w hen the pi[INVESTIGATOR_424858]. This will help us measure how often the medication is 
used.  We will also provide you with a wireless blood pressure monitor and will ask that you 
take your blood pressure at home systematically during each of  the research assessment 
periods (i.e., baseline, 10 week, 6 month and 12 month).  
 
5) You will be asked to perform some cognitive tasks. Some  of these tasks may involve 
computer -based tests of attention or decision -making. Together these tests may take as lon g 
as 20 minutes.  
 
6) During the in -person assessments you will also be given a battery of stress tests that are 
designed to induce a stress response so that we can monitor your cardiovascular response and 
recovery.  
 
7) Attendance at an information session that i s to be held within two weeks of the start of the 
intervention.  
 
8) If randomized into the intervention group, y ou will participate in the mindfulness  program, 
which consists of [ADDRESS_537457] control group, you will be invited to take part in the 
mindfulness class after the completion of the 6 month follow up assessments.  
 
9) Class sessions may be audio taped so we can analyze  the quality of the treatment you receive. 
The recordings will be transcribed so that we may analyze the text. The recordings will be 
identified by [CONTACT_5056], will only be heard by [CONTACT_424962].  
 
MB-BP Stage 2a - Consent Form, Version 2.2, October 11 January, 2, 2018    Page 3 of 9 10) You may be aske d to complete a few short quest ionnaires each week during the 9  week 
condition.  
 
11) After [ADDRESS_537458] on how to improve the intervention.  
 
12) Six months  and one year after the beginning of the study , you will be asked to return to the 
laboratory to repeat the same testing procedures.  
 
12)13) In addition to the six month and one year follow up, you will also be re -contact[CONTACT_425064], very brief two year follow up assessment. The two year follow up 
assessment is estimate d to take around [ADDRESS_537459] previously completed as a participant in the MB -BP 
Study. Specifically, we will be taking your blood pressure and weight as well as asking you a 
series of questions about hypertension medications and mindfulness practices.  For this 
additional follow up you will be given $50 USD.

MB-BP Stage 2a - Consent Form, Version 2.2, October 11 January, 2, 2018    Page 5 of 9 Feedback:  
At the end of the study, you will receive individual feedback about the changes that occurred 
since the first assessment. Specifically, you will receive an individualized handout listing % 
change (increase or decrease) on scales of attention, stress, mood,  health behaviours , weight,  and 
blood pressure across the study.  
 
Uncontrolled Hypertension:  
If during the in -person assessments it appears that you have uncontrolled hypertension (your 
average systolic blood pressure reading is 140 mmHg or greater and/or your average diastolic 
blood pressure is 90 mmHg or greater) AND you indicate to us that you are not currently being 
treated for hypertension, then we will be requesting your permission to contact [CONTACT_425065]/her of the blood pr essure results. If you do not have a health care provider 
and/or do not have health insurance, our staff will provide you with resources to help you search 
for one; although we cannot guarantee that we will be able to find you one nor that it will be free.  
It is your choice on whether or not you would like us to follow up with your health care provider. 
Your participation in the study is not contingent on this communication; however, it is our 
recommendation that all individuals with uncontrolled hypertensi on be under the care of a health 
care professional.  
 
2.  Discomforts and Risks  
The risks to you in this study are small.  The questionnaires used in the study are routine, 
standardized forms for epi[INVESTIGATOR_20851].  Certain questions may be upsetting a s they may 
probe sensitive psychological areas and inquire about upsetting or traumatic events, including 
physical, sexual or emotional abuse and/or current psychiatric symptoms.  The cognitive tests 
and stress battery may also invoke a stress response tha t may be uncomfortable. All aspects of 
the study are voluntary; you have the right to skip any thing during the study that make s you 
uncomfortable.  
 
Meditation -based interventions may results in discomfort with attention to unpleasant thoughts, 
feelings or body sensations. Some individuals may experience an initial increase in undesirable 
feelings with increased attention to them.  
 
It is possible that injuries could be sustained during the study either from the gentle  mindful 
movements ( i.e., yoga), or from physical activities that participants engage in as a way to reduce 
blood pressure.   To help limit this, you will receive a handout showing the  yoga poses that will 
be offered during the course  that you can show your health care provider so that they can advise 
on which poses to do, and which to avoid.  Modifications of poses will be available as needed. 
None of the poses (or the yoga as a whole) are mandatory to be done. You will also be  
encouraged to explore physical activities that  promote strength and conditioning as a way to 
reduce blood pressure. You will be  encouraged to not go beyond any physical  limits  of your 
body, and will be  encouraged to ask  your healthcare provider about  advised physical activities  
and mindful movements  if you  have any phy sical limitations.  
 
While physical and mental injury is always a possibility the potential for harm is limited.  Note 
that a research injury is any physical or mental injury or illness caused by [CONTACT_425066]-BP Stage 2a - Consent Form, Version 2.2, October [ADDRESS_537461] to pay for these 
costs out of pocket. Brown University’s policies do not cover payment for such things as lost 
wages, medical care expenses, or pain and suffering.  
 
Precautions should be taken to avoid injuries.  If you do become injure d during the study, you 
should call your doctor immediately.  You should also alert the study staff that you have been 
injured.  Heart attack and sudden death related to heart problems have been known to occur in 
people while they are exercising.  This is very rare, however.  Estimates of sudden cardiac death 
range from [ADDRESS_537462] benefits from this 
study.  However, participation in the study creates the potential benefit of a) identifying effective 
treatments for elevated blood pressure, b) gaining knowledge of the effects of mindfulness 
practices, c) receiving informatio n about your psychological and physical functioning.  As part of 
the study, you will receive a wireless blood pressure monitor that will be yours to keep. This 
monitor may provide additional opportunity to monitor your blood pressure at home, which may 
bene fit your health by [CONTACT_425067].  
 
4.  Alternative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
A number of different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including antihypertensive medication, diet changes, physical 
activity, and reducing excessive alcohol consumption may also be beneficial for reducing blood 
pressure. Education about these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424667], but other forms of these 
alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424668].  
 
5.  Confidentiality   
Your responses for this study will be kept confidential.  Al l data that we collect will be linked to a 
study ID# instead of your name.  All questionnaires in this study will be filled out th rough an 
online survey  or a paper version of the survey if you prefer.  All of these questionnaires will be 
linked solely to y our study ID#, so that your identity is protected and your answers are confidential.  
Although these measures have been taken to protect your personal information, complete 
confidentiality cannot be guaranteed when transmitting information over the interne t. 
 
While your confidentiality is protected to the extent of the law, there are limitations to 
confidentiality. If your questionnaire responses indicate that you pose a serious danger to 
yourself or to another person, then a collaborator ([CONTACT_425136]) who is a licensed psychiatrist, 
may contact [CONTACT_424939] a treatment provider.

The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) is a computerized test of sustained 
attention, response inhibition (executive function) and self-regulation. Subjects are instructed to 
press a key in response to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_358968] (1-9) and withhold response to a 
designated "no-go" integer. SART errors consist of summed commission errors (button press on 
no-go trial) and omission errors (button not pressed on "go" integers). SART performance is 
associated with prefrontal cortex functioning, has been found to increase with mindfulness 
training and is correlated with scores on mindfulness questionnaires (specifically, the Mindful 
Attention Awareness Scale).

 PRIOR APPROVALS : 
 
Participants recruited will be from those eligible participants already enrolled in a project for 
mindfulness intervention for blood pressure ongoing at Brown University ([CONTACT_425141]), entitled Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB- BP) Study  (formerly known as 
Mindfulness-Based Hypertension Therapy (MBHT).  There are no conflicts of interest, medical devices, biohazardous agents, or radiation.   
4.
 OBJECTIVES * 
 
The goal of this research is to determine the mental and neural mechanisms implicate d in the 
modulation of blood pressure (associated with cardiovascular risk ) by [CONTACT_425074] a 
mindfulness- based  blood pressure therapy. All  Participants , pre- selected based on Brown 
University MB-BP study enrollment, will have met entrance criteria for having prehypertension 
or hypertension, or another cardiovascular risk factor that could be influenced by [CONTACT_424896]. We aim to assess the neural correlates of mindfulness training on self -regulation, specifically 
inhibitory control, self-compassion, interoceptive attention, and emotion regulation, in these chronic disease patients.   
 We hypothesize that the blood pressure changes induced by [CONTACT_425078]- based 
intervention will be associated with  the differential engagement of brain regions implicated in 
emotional self-regulation. Spe cifically, we hypothesize that alterations both in resting state brain 
function and evoked upon prompts such as interoceptive attention, self -compassion, and 
inhibitory control will notably be linked to physiological measures of the autonomic system. We hypothesize that the altered cardiovascular risk measures can be understood through using 
advanced neuroimaging techniques such as functional connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging.    
5.
 BACKGROUND * 
Self-regulation, or the ability to intentionally manage cognitive and emotional resources to 
accomplish goals, is crucial to addressing a wide range of health problems influenced by [CONTACT_425079], such as excessive eating, lack of physical activity, addiction, and poor adherence to medical regimens. Mindfulness interventions have initial evidence to influence self-regulation, however it is still poorly understood what specific elements of mindfulness interventions are most 
effective at influencing self -regulation, and if those changes in self-regulation translate into clinically

Mindfulness training is an evidence-based approach to patient- centered caring1 and whole-person 
self-management .2 Mindfulness is “the awareness that emerges through purposely, and non-
judgmentally, paying attention to the unfolding of experience moment -by-moment” .3  
 Developed at the Un iversity of [LOCATION_005] Medical School by [CONTACT_36161]-Zinn, Saki 
Santorelli, and colleagues, Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an 8- week program 
that serves as the basis for multiple different condition -specific mindfulness-based interventions 
(MBI) provided in medical settings.
[ADDRESS_537477] funding for MBI research (NIH Reporter 2014), and publications related 
to mindfulness- related research have exponentially increased over the past [ADDRESS_537478] on the ability to self- manage and 
cope with chronic illness—although there is  initial evidence for positive outcomes on these 
measures.  Second, this study offers an opportunity to identify and test mechanistic self-
regulation targets (physiologic, psychological, neuropsychological, etc.) that are influenced by [CONTACT_186562], in the context of a chronic medical condition.  The project has been funded as  a core clinical trial for the NCCIH Science of Behavior Change 
UH2 project “Mindfulness Influences on Self- Regulation: Mental and Physical Health 
Implications.” We will conduct an experimental MRI study to evaluate several mechanistic self -
regulation targ ets of the Mindfulness-based blood pressure therapy (MB- BP), their neural 
substrates, and their potential impact on autonomic system measures.  
The 8 -week, 9- session MB -BP curriculum (approved for ongoing study at Brown University) is 
based on systematic and intensive training in mindfulness meditation and mindful hatha yoga.

 Page 3 of 18 Template Revised 8/8/[ADDRESS_537479] prehypertension or hypertension.  Embedded within the context of behavioral medicine, the MB -BP curriculum focuses on the 
experiential cultivation of both “formal” and “informal” mindfulness practices as a foundation for the cultivation of positive health behaviors and psychological and emotional resilience that can be effective u tilized across the adult life span. The approach supports the learning, 
strengthening and integration of a range of mindfulness- based self -regulatory skills through the 
development and refinement of inherent internal resources. A primary aim is to cultivat e ways of 
learning and being that can be utilized far beyond the completion of the program.   MB-BP builds a foundation of mindfulness skills (e.g. meditation, self- awareness, etc.) through 
the MBSR curriculum. MB- BP then directs attention towards hyperten sion risk factors. Early in 
the MB -BP, the importance of hypertension for health and mortality is described, along with 
hypertension risk factors. Participants will have their blood pressure and hypertension risk factors assessed at baseline, and be provid ed with this information during the first in -person MB-
BP session. This phase aims to engage participants’ interest in hypertension risk factors, and increase motivation for behavior change. MB -BP encourages participants to explore personal 
readiness for change in the different hypertension risk factors, and explore utilizing mindfulness practices to engage with those risk factors that they choose to. Each week, focus is provided on different hypertension risk factors. However, common themes exist across all hypertension risk factors including (1) awareness of thoughts, emotions and physical sensations particularly surrounding hypertension risk factors such as overconsumption of palatable foods, sedentary activities, alcohol consumption, medication adherence; (2) craving, particularly for hypertension risk factors such as overconsumption of palatable foods, sedentary activities, and alcohol consumption; (3) the impact of bringing mindfulness to every moment, particularly in relation to hypertension risk factors. For example, when consuming highly palatable food, bringing awareness to the emotions, thoughts and physical sensations prior to eating it, during eating it, along with the many minutes, if not hours, afterwards. Participants are trained to bring non-judgmental attention to the often short-term pleasure of overconsumption of foods, sedentary activities, heavy alcohol consumption, or not taking medications, and bring non- judgmental 
attention to the longer term suffering associations with these activities . Through this process, 
participants are encouraged to reflect on if behavioral choices provide more benefit or harm to their well-being, and to choose the behaviors that bring benefit. (4) Self- care: as awareness of 
thoughts, emotions and physical sensations increases, and self- regulation will likely increases as 
a result of the meditation practices, the curriculum will emphasize to participants that it is common for people to start caring for themselves more. It is a way of better knowing ourselves, and through knowing ourselves in in each moment, we often want to care for ourselves in each moment. This may mean taking medication that will help our health, or being more physical active, eating more healthily, or consuming more moderate amounts of alcohol. The intervention can be modified to change the dose of any of these 4 components, for example via (1) Increased use of specific meditations focused on health behaviors such as diet and physical activity. (2) Increased use of meditations focused on craving. Participants will be trained to notice craving

foods, sedentary activities, and alcohol consumption. (3) Increased used of mindfulness practices related to lo ng term experiences of health behaviors such as alcohol consumption, diet, physical 
activity and medication use on thoughts, emotions, physical sensations and well-being. (4) Self-care: Increased use of modules that show how mindfulness practice increased self -awareness and 
in doing so can increase people’s desire to care for themselves. The potential use of loving kindness meditation will be considered.    REFERENCES

-Pregnancy -Weight >  300 lbs 
 
7.
 STUDY -WIDE NUMBER OF SUBJECTS * 
 
60 participants in total, from those already recruited for ongoing, non-MRI study through 
Brown University study , all meeting study entrance criteria for having prehypertension or 
hypertension, or another cardiovascular risk factor that could be influenced b y this 
program; half enrolled in MB- BP at Brown University, whereas the other half will be 
waitlist controls.   
 
8. STUDY -WIDE RECRUITMENT METHODS * 
 
All participants will have been previously recruited for a study at Brown University. Eligible and interested participants will be further recruited for this MRI add -on.  
  
9.
 STUDY TIMELINES * 
Each participant will have two visits to UMass Med School Campus - before and after the 
MB-BP intervention (Visit 1 and 2, respectively). Each visit will include an MRI sc an 
and is expected to last approximately 2 hours.  
The endpoint of the study is after the second study visit (Visit 2) has been completed. 
However, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_424864]. A participant’s involvement in this study will also end if the subject withdraws their consent, is unable to adhere to the study protocol (e.g., finds 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED 
 
 Page 7 of 18 Template Revised 8/8/2017  the MRI procedure excessively uncomfortable), or is determined to be ineligible during 
the study by [CONTACT_473]. 
We anticipate that it will take approximately 3 years to enroll all 60 study participants, 
and that it will take 1 year to complete th e primary analyses.  
 
10. STUDY ENDPOINTS * 
The primary outcome will be differential over -time change in MRI resting -state 
functional connectivity (rsFC) patterns  for the interve ntion versus comparison group (e.g. 
default -mode, salience, and central executiv e, networks comprising regions such as 
anterior cingulate cortex, medial orbital cortex, insula, amygdala, and hippocampus). A 
significant group x time interaction will represent differential over -time change in the 
outcome ( rsFC) for the intervention versus comparison group. The model for Hypothesis 
1 will be parameterized with indicator variables for study group, time, and a group- time 
interaction  (for example using FSL general linear model (GLM), which can estimate 
multivariable models, where the res ponse Y  at each voxel is modeled as a linear 
combination of one or more predictors; applying “Randomise” permutation function). As 
such w e will also apply such a technique of regression modeling to predict change in 
hypertensive functional status , specifically blood pressure [s tandard -of-care clinic -
assessed systolic and  diastolic BP for monitoring hypertension treatment : baseline clinic 
BP obtained at two in -person screening visits ≥1 week apart, followed by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-person 
assessments at all follow -up periods (8w, 3m, 6m), all as part of Brown University 
project],  while considering important clinical and demographic covariates.  
The secondary outcomes will be in-scanner self -regulation task functional connectivity outcomes 
(1. emotional Go /NoGo inhibitory contr ol task; 2. self-compassion task, which contrasts self-
reassurance conditions with a self -criticism condition; 3. interoceptive attention task, which 
contrasts an interoceptive attention condition with an exteroceptive attention condition) . We will 
test for differential brain connectivity relation to each self -regulation manipulation between the 
intervention versus comparison group. Finally, associations between any differential intervention 
effect on self -regulation -task associated brain connectivity change will be further modeled for 
predictive ability of blood pressure change. 
 
 
11. PROCEDURES INVOLVED * 
 
Participation will entail a total time commitment of about 4.5 hours over the course of the 
study.  
 
Telephone Screen :~15 minutes  
Potential participants, already enrolled in Brown University study, will be prescreened by 
[CONTACT_756]. Respondents are informed that everything they say will be kept strictly confidential and they may stop or ask questions at any time.

This information will be stored in a locked cabinet.  
Participants who do not meet eligibility criteria will be asked to verbally provide consent to be re-contact[CONTACT_7678]. If consent is obtained, this will be recorded on the phone screen which will be stored in a locked cabinet, accessible only by [CONTACT_464]. 
Informed and Written Consent:~[ADDRESS_537483] and the study personnel o btaining consent. The participant will 
be given a copy of the signed informed consent form; originals shall be kept on file by [CONTACT_9916] a locked cabinet.   
The study visit will proceed with the neuroimaging session to examine brain function and 
structure using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting state and task -based functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI), as well as arterial spin labeling.  
 
Neuroimaging sessions: ~1.5 hours each 
Subjects will undergo two  MRI sessions – one at each of 2 study visits. These will 
include anatomic scans, arterial spin labeling, Diffusion Tensor Im aging (DTI), as well as 
resting state and task -based fMRI. Imaging will be conducted on a 3 Tesla magnetic 
resonance imaging scanner (Phillips 3 Tesla Ingenia CX dStream ), which has been 
approved for research and clinical studies in children and adults by [CONTACT_1622]. Magnetic 
resonance (MR) technology does not use ionizing radiation like an X- ray. Instead, it uses 
strong magnetic fields and radio waves to collect the images and data.  There are no 
known hazards or risks associated with these techniques. To ensure subjects can safely undergo MRI scanning, all participants will be screened by [CONTACT_425080], external decide or metal (including jewelry, body pi[INVESTIGATOR_2982], tattoos with metallic pi[INVESTIGATOR_165639]) . 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED 
 
 Page 9 of 18 Template Revised 8/8/2017  Acquisitions will include  T1 and T2 images ( in agreement with NINDS Common Data 
Elements, and suitable for incorporation in FITBIR) , T1-weight ed, ME-MPRAGE  
sequence;  T2-weighted  double echo fast spin echo sequence, (2) a multi-flip angle 3D 
spoiled gradient echo (FLASH type) compatible with the BIRN protocol; Resting state  
and functional MRI:  a multiband echo-planar imaging sequence with T2*- weighted 
BOLD contrast ; a fieldmap for distortion correction; Diffusion Tensor Imaging  sequence 
that uses a standard single shot, spin echo, echo planar acquisition with diffusion 
weighting gradient pulses  comprised of multiple diffusion-encoding directions with 
additional weighted images; Arterial spin labeling ASL):  pseudo-continuous ASL 
(PCASL) pulse sequence complemented by a single PCASL image with long repetition time ( TR; proton density) for scaling perfusion -weighted maps to absolute units of 
cerebral blood flow (CBF; ml/100g/min).  During the imaging session, autonomic system 
measures will also be obtained using respi[INVESTIGATOR_263143], finger plethysmograph for heart rate (HRV), and finger sensors for skin  conductance.  
A quick questionnaire about mental and physical state during the scanning session Amsterdam Resting -State Questionnaire (ARSQ 2.0) will be administered immediately 
after each MRI scanning session (< 5 minutes). 
Post-processing of MRI data will be performed with standard software (Freesurfer, FSL, 
and DTIStudio) to quantify the regional gray and white matter structural properties, as well as functional, and arterial properties in the brain. 
 
12.
 DATA AND SPECIMEN BANKING * 
Neuroimaging data and accompanying physiological, behavioral, and questionnaire, as well as 
participant data including telephone screening informed consent forms will be kept.  All 
personally identifiable  information will be " de-identified ", and coded with t he subject’s 
identification number. Thus, a ll study data will be stored without personal identifiers.   
 
All electronic information will be stored on a password- protected server accessible by 
[CONTACT_425081], located in locked offices at 
UMass Medical School. All written information will be locked in a file cabinet, located in a locked office. The office referred to is in the Center for Comparative NeuroImaging (CCNI). The CCNI is a secure building with swipe card entry  access. Subjects will be 
assigned a code for all documentation and data analysis sheets. The key linking the names and codes will be stored on this  password-protected server. Documents that 
contain identifying information will be stored separately from any primary research data.  
Imaging data will be transferred from the MRI system by [CONTACT_3553] a portable drive. Once the transfer is completed, the por table drive will be formatted to clean it of the acquired 
data. The data will only be stored in a password- protected computer accessible to study 
investigator and study staff. We also push the neuroimaging data to a server within the UMASS system. This ser ver is accessible only by [CONTACT_425082] -up regularly to password-protected drives. Aside from UMMS IRB 
representatives, only approved study personnel will have access to raw research data.  
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED 
 
 Page 10 of 18 Template Revised 8/8/[ADDRESS_537484] of subjects’ addresses and phone numbers will be destroyed at the end of the 
study. Data will be kept at least for a minimum of [ADDRESS_537485] drives and 
any electronic backup media. For the sake of transparency in our research practices, according to 
recommended practices the de-identified neuroimaging, physiological, task, questionnaire, and other participant data relevant for analysis may be made available to the public via a web 
repos itory (e.g. Open Science Framework). In that case, any de- identified data that have been 
posted publicly will remain publicly accessible in perpetuity.    
13. Data Analys is and M anagement* 
 
We will follow c urrent recommended methods for MRI data analysis.  The fMRI data will be 
analyzed using the standard software package FSL , together with  RETROICOR for retrospective 
correction of physiological motion artifacts using our peripheral measures of cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_424865] p hysiological noise in the blood oxygen level-
dependent (BOLD) signal. Following standard preprocessing steps (de- warpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], slice timing 
correction, motion correction, removal of physiological noise signals), the statistical analysis of brain activation data will be performed .  
 In addition to time point and group assignment, t he statistical models will include among 
regressors of interest  blood pressure, gender, age, in-scanner task outcomes, and the following 
regressors of no interest: head motion parameters and cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_358991]. Hypothese s will be expressed as: Is there any significant difference between 
the 2 time points in functional connectivity during resting state and task -specific induction (a, 
NoGo trials versus G o trials; b) self -reassurance versus self -criticism; and c) Interoception -
versus- Exteroception . The null hypothesis will be that any brain network functional connectivity 
changes between the [ADDRESS_537486] sizes, i.e. 1 or 1.5. We will recruit up to 60 participants so that we can exclude outliers.  
 
14.
 PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE  THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS * 
 
A trained neuroradiologist associated with the MRI imaging center at University of 
[LOCATION_005] Medical School will read the diagnostic MRI scans. In the event that there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_424866], the principal investig ator will be informed of this and 
arrange for the neuroradiologist to share with the subject the findings and facilitate in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_424867]-up care is needed and appropriate.

15. WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS  WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT * 
A subject’s  participation in this neuroimaging study will normally end at the completion 
of the visit. However, subjects may withdraw at any time and for any reason. If the 
subject decides to withdraw, no special procedures need to be followed. The subject can simply  leave the study at any time. Also, the trained study personnel may make study 
termination decisions if the subject is not able to adhere to the study protocol.  
 
16.
 RISKS TO SUBJECTS * 
 
This study will be conducted in a 3T MR scanner which has been approved for research 
and clinical studies in children and adults by [CONTACT_1622]. Magnetic resonance (MR) technology does not use ionizing radiation like an X-ray. Instead, it uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to collect the images and data. There are no known hazards or risks associated with these techniques.  
As it is the case for any MR scanner, significant risks can arise if ferromagnetic materials 
(this includes many types of common m etal objects) are brought into the high magnetic 
field environment of the scanner and immediate vicinity, as they can become hazardous projectiles.  
During the scan, some people do report claustrophobia (fear of being in enclosed small spaces), dizziness, mild nausea, headaches, a metallic taste in their mouth, double vision, or sensation of flashing lights. In rare cases during certain types of scans, a very slight, uncomfortable tingling of the back due to the rapid switching of the magnetic field has been reported. Although the intensity is not harmful to their hearing, the sounds that subjects hear inside the scanner may be annoying.   
During the scan, the comfort of the participant will be checked through the intercom system. The MRI technician can talk through the intercom system and the participant can 
hear through the head phones he/she will be wearing during the experiment. Similarly, the participants can talk during the experiment (in between the acquisitions) and the MRI technician can hear through the intercom system. In the unlikely event of any discomfort to the participant, the scan session will immediately be stopped and the participant will be taken out of the magnet. 
Identification of a real or false positive abnormality, i.e. lesion or a tumo r, during the 
MRI examination is possible. In the existence of such a condition, further investigation 
and/or treatment may be necessary. Although possible abnormalities are not related to the study, there may be emotional and physical risks associated with getting the follow-up medical evaluations. The initial diagnosis revealed by [CONTACT_425083] a true positive finding that may lead only to earlier identification of a condition. However, this condition may not have a survival possibility and the subject would need to live longer with the knowledge of this condition.

 Page 12 of 18 Template Revised 8/8/2017  Breach of Confidentiality: 
As with all studies, there is a chance that data could be linked back to a subject’s true 
identity, breaching confidentiality, and so there is a risk of psychological and social stigma that could adversely impact the subject. However, there will be many safeguards in place to prevent this occurrence.

Results will not be routinely shared with subjects. However, if an MRI reading is 
indicative  of pathology, such as hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, multiple sclerosis, 
tumors, and aneurysms, these results will be shared with subjects. In addition, during the clinical interview the study clinicians may determine that the study subject has psychiatric symptoms that are in need of treatment, or that the subject might be harmful 
to themselves or someone else. In this case, these results will be shared with the subject, and we will help the subject find appropriate care.

The CCNI is a research laboratory of ~3,000sq-ft building on the main campus. This center 
contains a conference room, faculty offices (~140 square feet each), secretary cubicle, shared student room, a wet lab, and a small room for mechanical and electronic work.  
CCNI offices and laboratories are networked with switched 10/100 Mb/sec TCP/IP 
communication lines. CCNI currently has five SGI, two Sun stations, and ten PC’s. Some of these SGI and PC are in a “common” area where collaborators will have access to them for data analysis and software 
In addition to the shared computers in the CCNI, we have computers within the offices located in 
BNRI. There are two identical Mac Pro5.[ADDRESS_537487] a Dell OptiPlex 755 Desktop, which has the Linux operating system installed on it.  
Matlab2016 (Natick,  MA) is available to perform various analyses. LCModel version 6.2.2 is 
installed on the Dell OptiPlex Desktop to perform proton spectroscopy analysis and to determine the measured metabolite levels. SPSS (to perform statistical analysis), Microsoft Office  
Applications as well as Adobe Application (to write our reports and papers and to prepar e 
illustrations), EndNoteX8 (to manage references) are available for our researchers. We also have free image analysis software such as FreeSurfer (Martinos Center for  Biomedical Imaging, 
Charles Town, MA), FSL (FMRIB, Oxford, [LOCATION_006]) and SPM (Welcome Trust Centre for NeuroImaging, London, [LOCATION_006]) to perform the anatomical neuroimaging analysis. 
 
Advanced MRI Center (AMRIC):   
- Neuroimaging data will be acquired at AMRIC. 
 The AMRIC facilitates a new Philips Ingenia CX dStream 3.0T system with a higher order shim 
function which enables us to obtain improved image quality in field-sensitive applications and techniques such as single- voxel spectroscopy, chemical shift imaging,  single -shot EPI [INVESTIGATOR_424868].

The Quasar Dual gradient system provides industry leading performance specifications for peak strength and slew rate with a dual mode capability that optimizes advanced applications requiring very high peak mode capabilities. The maximum gradient amplitudes and slew rates corresponding to the dual mode are 80 mT/m, 100 mT/m/ms and 40 mT/m, 200 mT/m/ms respectively.  
This Ingenia 3.0T system has a multiple RF sources, which adapts the RF signals to suit each 
individual patient. This results in faster scans, enhanced image uniformity/consistency, over a broader range of applications.  
This Ingenia 3.0T system features MultiBand SENSE which allows to use state-of-the- art 
acceleration factors in the brain b y simultaneously exciting multiple slices. Due to a shorter 
minimum TR for fMRI, larger anatomical coverage or higher temporal resolution can be used. In 
the DWI/DTI sequences larger anatomical coverage or higher number of diffusion directions can be acqui red. With MultiBand SENSE, fMRI and DTI exams can be performed with high speed 
and high resolution, simultaneously. 
This Ingenia 3.0T system is equipped with a Multi-nuclear spectroscopy (MNS) system, which 
provide the ability to perform 13C, 31P, 7Li, 23Na, 19F and other nuclei spectroscopy and imaging. The multiple RF amplifiers in this system includes two 18 kW solid -state 1H channel 
narrowband amplifier and one 4 kW broadband (10-130 MHz) Multi- nuclear amplifier.  
This Ingenia 3.0T system has a bore diameter of 60 cm and provides a full- size 50 cm field -of-
view.  
fMRI Stimulus Delivery System  
A fully integrated fMRI stimulus delivery system from MRA (Model: fMRI -0502- STD1; MRA; 
Washington, PA, [LOCATION_003]; http://www.mra1.com/) and Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc; 
Albany, CA, [LOCATION_003]; http://www.neurobs.com/ ) is available for both clinical and research. The 
MRA complete system includes the fMRI stimulus delivery console, Windows computer system, patient response hand switches, video projection into the MRI bore, and MRI compatible patient headphones.

My name [CONTACT_832] __________________. I am calling from the Center for Comparative NeuroImaging 
at the UMass Medical School, because you expressed interest in participating in our brain imaging study  through your participation in the Brown University Mindfulness-Based Blood 
Pressure Reduction Study, formerly known as Mindfulness-Based Hypertension Therapy . Is that 
correct?  
[If yes, proceed, if no, note in Potential Subject Log].  
 In order to determine if you are a good match for this particular study, I will be asking you some questions about your health and history which will take from 10 to 15 minutes. Is now  a good 
time to speak? [If yes, proceed, if no, ask for other times and note in Potential Subject Log].  There are a few things that I’d like to make clear before we start the interview. First of all, some of the questions will be very personal and sensitive. Are you in a private place to talk? Because this interview is of a personal nature, it is important that you understand that everything you say will be kept strictly confidential. No one outside of our project will ever be able to see your 
answers, and we will not keep your name [CONTACT_425106]. Your 
answers to our brief questions about marijuana and other “recreational” drug use will also be 
kept strictly confidential and will not be reported. 
 I am asking these questions because you are participating in the Mindfulness for Blood Pressure 
Intervention Study at Brown University, we would we would like you to participate in a study where we will image your brain 2 times, before and after the intervention. Everything you say in this interview will be kept strictly confidential, and you may stop or ask questions at any time. If 
you don’t understand what I am asking, please stop me and ask me to explain. If you are eligible for the study we will ask for your name [CONTACT_425130] t his interview, otherwise we will not 
ask for your name. If you like, though, we can keep your information on file for future studies.

Title of research study:   
Mindfulness Influences on Self -Regulation:   
Mental and Physical Health Implications for blood pressure 
(Mindfulness MB -BP Self -Regulation MRI)  
Investigator:  Jean King, Ph.D.  
Sponsor:  The National Institutes of Health  
Why are you being invited to take part in a research study?  
You are being asked to part icipate because you are between [ADDRESS_537495] MRI scanning done.  
What should you know about a research study?  
Your participation is entirely voluntary. 
You may decide not to take part or decide to quit the study at any time, without any changes in 
the quality of the health care you receive.  
You will be told about any new information or changes in the study that might affect your willingness to participate.  
You are free to ask all the questions you want before decidin g if you want to be in this study. 
Why are we doing this research? 
The purpose of the study is to begin to find out if a mindfulness -based blood pressure 
intervention affects brain function and whether any alterations are associated with mechanisms 
of self- regulation  that accompany participation in such a program. We hope that such 
relationships exist, so that we can better understand the effect of mindfulness on self-regulation mental and behavioral changes that could impact blood pressure regulation. This  knowledge may 
help researchers hone in on effective mechanisms, and healthcare providers to improve the care of people w ith prehypertension, hypertension, or other related cardiovascular risk factor s.

We expect that you wi ll be in this research study for 2 Visits, which should take approximate ly 
4.5 hours in total to complete.  
How many people will be studied?  
We expect about 60 people to be in this portion of the research study at  UMass Me dical School. 
1 - What happens if I sa y yes, I want to be in this research?  
If you want to participate in this research, you will be asked to come in for a total of two visits –  
before and after the Mindfulness -Based Blood Pressure intervention (Visits 1 and 2). Each visit  
includes an MRI sca n, and should take about 2 hours total to complete.  
 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) ~1.5 hours : 
This study includes two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. An MRI is a technique for 
taking images of the brain. It uses a magnetic field and radio wave s - no ionizing radiation is 
used. We will take you to the MRI imaging suite at the University of [LOCATION_005] Medical 
School’s main campus and ask you a series of safety questions before we bring you into the MRI room. Some of these questions might be re petitive but is important that we make sure it is safe 
for you to have an MRI scan. 
Because the scanner contains an extremely strong magnet you will be asked to remove all metal 
objects on you. This includes things like: watches, rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings and other body pi[INVESTIGATOR_2982], belts, loose change, wallet (with credit cards), items of clothing containing magnetic materials (for example, under wire bras, certain types of zippers), and shoes. We will ask you change into a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424874] (“scrubs”) before you go into the scanning room. Your clothing and personal items will be locked up in a safe place until the session is completed. 
You will spend 90 minutes  in an MRI scanner, which looks like a large cylinder with a tube 
running down the center.  You will be asked to lie down on your back on a foam -padded table 
and to put your head into a special holder. The table slides inside the “hole” of the scanner.  Soft 
foam rubber sponges may be placed on both sides of your head for comfort and to keep your head still. A headset with microphone allows you to hear and talk to the technician operating the scanner at all times.  
During the scanning procedure, you will hear a number of different sounds.  These sounds, 
which can be loud, are part of the  normal operation of the scanner. These noises vary with the 
particular scan being performed, and include sounds like a hammer hitting a pi[INVESTIGATOR_424875], repetitive buzzing noises, and long series of loud beeps. Some scans are silent. These sounds, or combinations of them, will then be repeated several times, depending upon the specific scan sequence being used.  The sounds you hear during the scanning session will not harm your hearing, but you will be given a pair of earplugs to wear for your comfort. Even with these 
earplugs in you will always be able hear the technician because they do not block all sound. You 
are free to talk during the preparation time and during the breaks, but you should not talk during the actual scanning process.  During these sessio ns, you should try to remain as still as possible.  Formatted:  Indent:  Left:  0", Hanging:   0.25",   No bullets  or

this time, you will be asked a series of questions from  a questionnaire that asks your experiences 
while in the MRI scanner  (Amsterdam Resting -State Questionnaire) .  This survey will take 
approximately 5 minutes to complete.  
The MRI scanner takes moment -to-moment ima ges of your brain’s blood- flow and tissue. These 
images are digitally stored. Thousands of patients across the country safely undergo such 
procedures in radiology departments every day. The MRI procedure itself is not experimental; 
rather, it is well known  to be safe.  
What are the risks of being in this study? 
Magnetic resonance (MR) technology does not use ionizing radiation like an X -ray.  Instead, it 
uses strong magnetic fields and radio- frequency waves to collect the images and data.  There are 
no known serious health hazards or risks associated with these techniques for most people.  
However, significant risks may exist for people with: 
• Cardiac pacemakers  
• Aneurysm clips (in your brain) and other vascular stents  (tubes in your veins) , filters, 
clips or other devices  that have been surgically put in you for any reason 
• Prosthetic heart valves (a mechanical device that helps your heart pump blood) 
• Other prostheses (a pi[INVESTIGATOR_424876] a missing part of the body) 
• Neuro -stimulator devices (a pi [INVESTIGATOR_424877])  
• Implanted infusion pumps (a device that stays in your body and helps give you medicine) 
• Cochlear (ear) implants (a device used to help you hear) 
• Ocular (eye) implants (a device put in your eye to help you see) 
• Known metal fragments or pi[INVESTIGATOR_424878]  
• Contact [CONTACT_425089] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_424879])  
• Contact [CONTACT_425090] (people who are sheet metal workers, welders, or others could 
have this contact)  
• Any surgeries where something metal was p ut in you  
• Certain tattoos (please tell the study doctor if you have a tattoo so that we can make sure 
it is safe)  
• Certain intrauterine contraception devices (IUD’s) 
 
You will be asked whether you have such devices and if so, you will not be able to partici pate in 
this study.  Significant risks also can arise if certain types of metal objects are brought into the scanning area, as they can become hazardous projectiles.  These types of items are not permitted in the scanning area.  The exams are painless, and  except for the pulsating sounds, you will not 
be aware that MR scanning is taking place. 
This study will be conducted in an MR scanner which has been approved by [CONTACT_425091]. Although there are no known significant health ris ks from these scans, there 
could be adverse effects that are delayed or very mild, such that they have not yet been recognized.  Most people experience no ill effects from the large magnetic field, but some people

metallic taste in their mouth, double vision or sensation of flashing lights.  These symptoms, if 
present, disappear shortly after leaving the MR machine. If you experience discomfort from being in the s canner, you should notify the examiner immediately and you will be removed from 
the scanner. You should also note you will be asked to remain as still as possible during the  scanning session. Remaining motionless can result in physical discomfort. 
You may  feel cramped inside the scanner.  The technologist will be able to hear you at all times 
and you are free to end the procedure at any time. In rare cases, a very slight, uncomfortable tingling of the back due to the rapid switching of the 
magnetic field h as been reported during certain types of scans. In case you have such a sensation, 
you are asked to report this immediately, so the scan can be changed to avoid this. Although these precautions will avoid all known risks associated with MR, this procedure may involve risks to you that are currently unforeseeable. 
A qualified neuroradiologist will interpret your brain scan, as you are having images taken of 
your brain tissue and brain blood flow. We will retain your contact [CONTACT_425092]. Any medically important findings on the MRI will be identified and reported to you. This process could also produce some discomfort, and would only be done if believed in your medical best interests. Please note that 
you will not be billed for the procedure , and that w e will also help you get any follow- up care 
you might need. 
Another  
risk of being in this study is a loss of your personal information. This is very unlikely to 
happen , and w e will do everything to make sure that your information is protected.   
What are my responsibilities if I take part in this research?  
If you take part in the research, it is important for your safety that you : 
• Follow the directions of the study doctor and research staff.  
• Tell your health care providers that you are in a research study . 
• Tell your study doctor and staff about all medications you are taking (prescription and 
over the counter) and all of your health issues.  
• Call the study doctor or staff at [PHONE_8845] if you have any questions. 
Will being in this study help me  in any way?  
There may be no benefit to being in this study. However, knowledge gained from this study may 
help others with your condition in the future.  
Will bei ng in this study cost me any money ? 
Participating in this study will NOT require a payment, co -pay, or insurance charge. There will 
be no cost to you from being in this research study other than the cost of your transportation to UMass Medical School.

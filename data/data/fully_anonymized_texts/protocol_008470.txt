1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
 
While recent advances in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) have dramatically improved 
functional recovery for many patients, the burden of disability from ischemic stroke remains  and more than 
half of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage  (sICH)  remain disabled at one year post -
stroke .4,14,[ADDRESS_841602] anti -inflammation 
and diminished markers of oxidative stress.7,16,24, 35,45 The benefit of early exercise in AIS  and sICH  in 
decreasing pro -inflammatory factors has been demons trated in animal models  when exercise is introduced 
between 24 hours and three days  in AIS and at three  or four days in sICH .40,53-55 An exercise intervention 
that is standardized in frequency with measureable intensity and duration is necessary to explore the effects 
of an exercise intervention in acutely ill patients with AIS and sICH . We hypothesize that a balancing of 
the inflammatory response after sICH can occur with the application of moderate exercise in the acute 
period.  
Objectives  (include all primary and secondary objectives ) 
 
Primary Objective:  to determine the effects of twice -daily, lower extremity CE of 20 minutes duration  
plus usual care , compared to usual care alone , on the trajectories of M1 versus M2 cytokine phenotypes  in 
the serum and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) . 
 
Secondary Objectives:

(i) To determine  the effects of twice -daily, lower extremity CE of [ADDRESS_841603] retrospective cohort of patients receiving usual care 
during the COVID -19 pandemic  on, the immediate and sustained physical impairment , 
disability scores  and relevant coavriates such as delirium and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_630755] 30 days after hemorrhage.  
(ii) To determine the correlation between serum and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_630756].  
(iii)To explore the relationship between pre -morbid physical function and quality of life and change s in 
inflammatory factors among all participants.  
(iv) To determine the effects of twice -daily, lower extremity CE of [ADDRESS_841604] Assessment Procedure on 
day 1 of the study at transfer from the ICU or discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] 30 days after 
hemorrhage.  
 
2. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with proce dures, 
drug or device, and an y other relevant information to justify the research ) 
 
There is an urgent need to develop interventions aimed at reducing the burden of severe disability in 
patients with sICH  and AIS . Outcomes for patients with sICH have remained relatively stagnant and while 
outcomes after acute ischemic stroke have improved over the past several years with the widening of 
treatment windows for thrombolysis and use of thrombectomy the burden of disability after stroke in 
general remains high.4,14,[ADDRESS_841605] ion and diminished markers 
of oxidative stress.16,24,35,40 An added benefit of early exercise in sICH was suggested by [CONTACT_630776] a decrease in IL1β and IL -6 and an increase in IL -10 with treadmill running within 4 
days of sICH in rats.40 Enhanced motor recovery was thought to be explained in part by [CONTACT_630777] h as an endpoint.23 Zhang and colleagues demonstrated a reduction in pro -
inflammatory factors and anxiety behaviors in animal models with induced AIS.53 
 An adaptable exercise intervention that is standardized in frequency with measureable intensity and 
duration is necessary to explore the effects of an exercise intervention in critically ill stroke patients. 
Accessibility of the intervention to patients with severe disability and altered levels of consciousness 
presents a challenge that can be overcome with in -bed cycle ergometry (CE) (see figure 1).  Cycle 
ergometry is provided to patients by [CONTACT_630778][INVESTIGATOR_630757] e in bed by 
[CONTACT_630779]. Active cycling can occur as a patient attempts to move their legs in a pedaling motion. Two 
recent trials of  lower extremity CE  reporting 963 sessions in critically ill medical patients cited a 0.6 -2% 
rate of adverse events requiring termination of a cycling session, none requiring further intervention after

hemodynamics or intracranial pressure.6,8,25 -27 
 Enrollment of subjects within the original study  framework was put on hold  beginning on March 
16, 2020 due to the necessary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_630758] -19 and to maximize 
reosurces to treat hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] . Adding a second control group where all variables except for 
biologic and survey data will allow comparison of three different care conditions, intervention plus usual 
care, usual care only and usual care only during a pandemic. Usual care in terms of study visit timing, 
number, and length may be different than pre -pandemic care paradigms due to staff redeployment and 
restructuring are care areas to support care during a disaster.     
3. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures    
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine care ). 
 
 This pi[INVESTIGATOR_547527] a randomized parallel group design to determine the difference in the 
expression of pro - and anti -inflammatory cytokines in response to this specific exercise intervention plus 
usual care versus usual care only. Patients will be enrolled on day 3 of illness and data will be collected for 
seven consecutive days.  We seek to enroll a convenience sample of up to 100 consecutive patients with 
supratentorial sICH and acute ischemic stroke admitted to the Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_630759]  (NCCU) . Patients will be screened within 24 -48 hours of arrival for eligibility according 
to the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below. Informed consent will be obtained from the patient or 
legally authorized representative  (LAR) . The consenting process will be performed remotely via 
videoconference when possible.  
 Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention  plus usual care or usual care  only group 
using  a standard randomization schema generated by [CONTACT_630780] 14 .0 (Coll ege Station, [LOCATION_007] ). The AIS and 
sICH cohorts will have separate randomization schemas.  
 After enrollment, the Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
Glabal Measure of Health v1.2  questionnaire for (pre -morbid health ) will be administered to the patient or 
their LAR depending on the patient’s ability to complete the form. At the last follow -up visit the patient or 
LAR will complete the Stroke Impact Survey. Additionally, the Sunnybrook Neglect Assessment 
Procedure will be administered to the patient on day [ADDRESS_841607] to complete this measure at subsequent time points.  
 The intervention group will receive two CE sessions  per day after randomization with a unit 
owned cycle (Reck Motomed Letto, [LOCATION_013]).  Sessions will be 
held at least 2hours apart  to allow for patient rest and activities 
of patient care . The clinician will set the device to an automatic 
program where passive cycling will be initiated and the device 
will provide resistance if the patient attempts  to actively cycle. 
Vital signs  (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, 
intracranial pressure)  will be monitored continuously by a study 
team member present at the bedside during the CE session , if an

 arterial line is not available the non -invasive cuff will be cycled every 5 minutes . Continuous vital signs 
will be extracted from the Sickbay so ftware application, which collects physiologic data on all NCCU (see 
IRB00132987 Multimodality Neuromonitoring in t he Neurocritical Care Unit).  A clinician will observe the 
patient at all times during the session  for signs of pain and discomfort and will admi nister the behavioral or 
visual analog pain scale  every 5 minutes during the session  depending on the patient’s level of 
consciousness . Patient tolerance will be defined as the absence of the following: decl ine in neurological 
examination;  sustained change in intracranial pressure, blood pressure, heart rate  or oxygen saturation 
outside of prescribed goals per establishe d patient specific plan of care; an increase in pain as measured by 
[CONTACT_630781]; a nd accidenta l tube/device/catheter removal.22,[ADDRESS_841608] 
from admission to 90 days after the initial ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.  
The following samples will be obtained for the intervention + usual care group and the control group, usual 
care only:  
a) A 2 teaspoon sample of the patient’s serum on the day of enrollment and two additional 
times during the seven day study period timed with routine collection of blood, when 
possible, for daily blood tests while the patient is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Blood samples will be 
collec ted from an existing arterial or central line or via venipuncture . The initial blood 
sample will be collected on study day 1 prior to cycling in the intervention group and 
between 8 am -12 pm in the control group. Subsequent samples will be drawn after the 
second cycling session and between 2 pm and 6 pm in the control group.    
b) A 4-[ADDRESS_841609] cycling session of the day for the intervention group.  
c) A 4 mL sample of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) on the day of enrollment and two additional 
times during the seven day study period timed with collection of other sampling , when an 
external ventricular drain is in place as a part of care . CSF sampling will occur in patients 
with an external ventricular drain inserted as part of their care and will end after 3 samples 
or when the drain is discontinued.  Efforts will be made to time CSF sampling with planned 
sampling, if possible and sampling will be performed by a nurse or physician study team 
member trained in the skill as part of their job using aspetic technique. The initial CSF  
sample will be collected on study day 1 prior to cycling in the intervention group and 
between 8 am -12 pm in the control group. Subsequent samples will be drawn after the 
second cycling session and between 2 pm and 6 pm in the control group.    
 
All samples will be placed on dry ice, centrifuged and stored in a -70 degree Celsius freezer within 1 h our 
of obtaining the sample. S amples will be labeled with de -identified data (patient study number and date 
only).

  Usual care in the NCCU consists of  evaluation and treatment by [CONTACT_630782][INVESTIGATOR_630760]. Patients may be seen up to 5 times per week depending on their level of participation 
and intensity of therapy required, however many patients with sICH particularly those in coma are treated 
by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_11437] 2 times per week. Nursing staff in the NCCU pro vide passive range of motion  and progressive 
a patient’s mobility from supi[INVESTIGATOR_630761], sitting at the side of bed, transferring to chair, lift 
assisted transfer to chair and ambulation as the patient’s condition allows . All usual care activities will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_630783].  Usual care during the pandemic is 
similar to the care described above however, due to resource constraints it is possible that care focused on 
mobility and recovery was reprioritized in order to provide acute and intensive care for other patients.

b. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participant s. 
The study will enroll patients for approximately  two years. Each patient will receive  study interventions  or 
procedures depending on group assignment for 7 days , assessment of motor function and physical/co gnitive 
functioning on transfer from the NCCU or [ADDRESS_841614] study day if the patient completed study 
activities outside of the NCCU  and 30 days  (-10 days, +30 days)  after occurrence of sICH.  We will allow a 
[ADDRESS_841615] this value for all patients in this study.  If a patient is not scheduled for an in -person visit 
after discharge, only the 90 day modified Rankin scale will be collected as an outcome measure.  
c. Blinding , including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_630763] a large pi[INVESTIGATOR_630764]’ rooms in the intervention group twice per day during the initial 
study period , however outco me measures at NCCU transfer  and 30 days will be obtained by a study team 
member blinded to the participant’s group assignment . 
d. Justification o f why participant s will not receive routine  care or will have current therapy 
stopped.  
Current therapy will not be stopped. Participants will receive the study intervention in addition to usual 
care.  
e. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non -treatment group.  
In order to detect a signal of cytokine modulation with the intervention regimen of supi[INVESTIGATOR_630765], 
a control group not receiving the intensive intervention regimen is necessary  for comparison . 
f. Definition of treatment failure or participant  removal criteria.  
If a patient meets the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_630766] >2 consecutive sessions the patient will be withdrawn 
from the study: change in neurological examination, s ustained change in intracranial pressure, blood 
pressure, heart rate, or oxygen saturation that is outside of provider -prescribed range , significant pain 
exacerbated by [CONTACT_630784] .22,34  
g. Description of what happens to participant s receiving therapy when study ends or if a 
participant ’s participation in the study end s prematurely.  
Upon study procedure completion participants will continue to r eceive usual care.  
 
4. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion criteria:  Rationale:  
Age >[ADDRESS_841616] that patients with 
infratentorial ICH often require surgery, introducing 
an overlay of inflammation above that which is 
caused by [CONTACT_630785]. It is known that 
intraventricular hemorrhage increases severity of 
illness and mortality, however it is a common co -
occurring process in patients with ICH and should 
be studied concurrently.13 
Acute ischemic stroke with a Medical Research 
Council Sum Score (MRCSS) of <27.  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke and 
motor weakness as identified by [CONTACT_630786] 27.21 
Pre-morbid modified Rankin Score of 0 -2 The modified Rankin Score (mRS) is a commonly 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 10 of 18 
 used tool to quantify disability after stroke and is 
scored from 0 to 6 with higher  score s describing  
increase d disability including death. The mRS will 
be used to characterize a patient’s pre -morbid 
functional status correlating with a patient’s 
potential for recovery after stroke  as well as an 
outcome measure at discharge and 30 days after 
hemorrhage .5,13 Patients with a mRS >[ADDRESS_841617] a legally authorized representative to provide 
consent on their behalf   
Exclusion criteria:   
Patients with known inflammatory conditions, 
infection requiring antibiotics or pregnancy  Underlying inflammatory disorders such as, but not 
limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus and 
fibromyalgia and pregnancy will impact 
interpretation of inflammatory biomarkers. Patients 
with a diagnosed infection requiring antibiotics 
(e.g., bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract 
infection) at the time of screening will be excluded 
due to associated systemic inflammation.  
Patients receiving daily anti -inflammatory 
medications including but not limited to prednisone, 
methotrexate, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory 
medications (ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin, 
celecoxib)  and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] >325mg.  These anti -inflammatory medications will adversely 
impact our ability to interpret inflammatory 
markers.  
Glasgow  Coma Score (GCS) [ADDRESS_841618] form of coma 
wherein no response can be elicited from the patient 
in terms of eye opening, verbal output and motor 
response. A GCS of 3 on admission portends a poor 
outcome.41  
Patients in whom withdrawal of life support is being 
considered by [CONTACT_630787].  These patients are likely to die prior to or shortly 
after randomization. In the event that a surrogate 
elects not to withdraw life support, the patient will 
be reassessed for eligibility once more within 72 
hours of the ictus.  
Injury to the lower extremities, hips or pelvis, 
weight >250 kg (weight limit of cycle), or body 
habitus precluding normal function of cycle.  These injuries or physical characteristics may make 
the cycling activity unsafe.  
 
5. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.  
The cycle ergometer  (CE) is capable of facilitating movement of the upper and lower extremities regardless 
of the participant’s ability to  participate, therefore making it possible for use in patients with varying levels 
of consciousness and physical impairment. The CE is currently used by [CONTACT_630788][INVESTIGATOR_630767].  
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non -FDA 
approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant  populations are 
changed.  
No medications will be administ ered.

  Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable . 
Pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL -1β, TNFα, IL -6; Anti -inflammatory /repair  factors : IL-10, BDNF  
b. Secondary outcome variables  will be measured at discharge and [ADDRESS_841619] -intracerebral 
hemorrhage  or acute ischemic stroke . 
• Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)  
• Barthel Index will be measured  at discharge and 30 days  
• Medical Research Council Sum Score and dynamometry to measure muscle strength  
• Discharge location (e.g., home, nursing facility), although not well studied, is commonly associated 
with physical function at discharge.  
• SF-12 
• Vital signs (e.g., heart, rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697])  
• Delirium positive days  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105484] (e.g., catheter associated urinary tract infection and central line associated 
blood stream infection)  
• CSF cytokines and repair factors  
• Stroke Impact S urvey  
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis.  
 
Sample size was calculated for a fully powered trial and 9% of this sample size will be used for this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_630768]’ methodology.[ADDRESS_841620] size of 0.28 with power of 80% and an α of 0.05 requires a sample size of 400 for a full trial 
and 9% represents a pi[INVESTIGATOR_513933] [ADDRESS_841621] -intervention outcomes will be 
compared between the groups. If the baseline characteristics are found to be different, an adjusted analysis 
as described below will be conducted. Mean (SD) or median (IQR) will be used to describe continuous 
variables, and frequency (%) will be used for categorical variables. Mean differences in cytokines between 
the three time points (baseline, day 3 and day 7) will be calculated for each participant in the intervention 
and control groups. We will also plot data over time by [CONTACT_19313]. Assumptions of normality will be checked 
and appropriate parametric or non -parametric tests will be used to detect absolute mean differences due to 
the small sample size, with an a priori significance level of 0.05, although the primary aim of this study is 
to estimate effect size. Data quality will be ensured by [CONTACT_630789]. Statistical analysis will be performed using Stata 
14.0 (College Station, [LOCATION_007]).  
 
Primary aim (1):  To determine whether a regimen of twice daily 20 -minute sessions of CE plus usual care 
administered to patients with sICH  and AIS  (n=20) increases cytokines of the M2 phenotype and decreases 
cytokines of the M1 phenotype within 10 days of sICH when compared to a similar group of patients with 
sICH receiving usual care only (n=20).  
 The effect size, absolute difference between the two groups and the standard error of the difference 
will be estimated. The standardized difference will be estimated using Cohen’s d. A two -sample t -test will 
be used to detect differences between post -test outcomes. If the baseline outcome is different, an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the outcomes between the two groups adjusting for the 
baseline difference as a covariate.  
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 13 of 18 
 Hypothesis: Patients in the CE group will demonstrate an increase in cytokines of the M2 phenotype and a 
decrease in the M1 phenotype when compared to the group receiving usual care only.  
Aim 2: To determine the effects of twice -daily, lower extremity CE of [ADDRESS_841622] retrospective cohort of patients receiving usual care during the 
COVID -19 pandemic  on, the immediate and sustained physical impairment and disability scores at NCCU 
discharge and 30 days  after hemorrhage .   
 Data from this aim will be analyzed in the same fashion as described above.  
Hypothesis: The CE group will demonstrate decreases in 90 -day modified Rankin Scale score,  increases in 
the Medical Research Council sum score (muscle strength) and grip strength, less delirium positive days 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105484].  
d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
If a patient meets the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_630766] >2 consecutive sessions the patient will be 
withdrawn from the study: change in neurological examination, sustained change in intracranial pressure, 
blood pressure, heart rate, or oxygen saturation that is outside of provider -prescribed range or significant 
pain exacerbated by [CONTACT_630784].  
6. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected frequency.  
The risks of this study are designed to be minimal. Potential risks to the participant include the 
following: hemodynamic instability, increased intr acranial pressure, skin breakdown associated with the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_630769] , pain, muscle spasm  and musculoskeletal injury.  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
Patients are continuously monitored on a cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_630770], heart rate, 
intracranial pressure (when applicable) and blood pressure, measured by [CONTACT_630790] -invasive 
cuff. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_630771], Sickbay software application currently 
installed in the NCCU and collecting data from all cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_225614]. Pain will be measured  and 
documented every 5 minutes  visual analog scale or behavioral pain scale in patients unable to report pain 
level.  
The NCCU is staffed 24 hours per day by a dedicated team of Neuro Intensivists, fellows and resident 
physicians assigned exclusively to the unit who can respond immediately to physiologic changes or adverse 
events when notified. A chain of command is followed when a primary provider is not available to respond 
due to other emergent patient care duties.  
Administration of cycle ergometry will be performed by [CONTACT_079]  [INVESTIGATOR_630772] (RN) who currently perform this therapy in the NCCU  and have been trained in current personal 
protective equipment standards in the setting of the novel Coronavirus pandemic . These clinicians are in 
possession of reusable face shields and masks as part of their routine work.  All clinicians performing the 
intervention will have documented competency using a standardized competency checklist including 
physiologic monitoring considerations, positioning and alignment of the patient in the cycle ergometer and 
considerations for the management of lines and tubes to mitigate risk of dislodgement.  The applicant will 
observe the application and performance of CE performed by [CONTACT_630791] 10% of sessions to assure 
correct procedure. All procedures for applying the CE to the patient will be explained to the patient or 
family member(s) in attendance.  A physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_630773].   Standard disinfection  of the ergometer , inclusive of current 
guidelines for prevention of Coronavirus transmission,  will be performed at the conclusion of each session  
by [CONTACT_3476] .  
A recent prospective safety and feasibility study of supi[INVESTIGATOR_630774] 541 sessions (181 patients), dislodgement of a radial arterial line. Another 
recent prospective study of 20 patients in an NCCU with intracranial pressure monitoring, 3 of which had a 
diagnosis of sICH, found no significant increases in intracranial pressure. Since, cycle ergometry is 
currently available in the NCCU, we performed an internal retrospective evaluation of 23 patients with an

Page 14 of 18 
 intraventricular catheter (intracranial pressure monitor) over [ADDRESS_841623] of care blood draws (phlebotomy 
or arterial line) when possible and will be drawn by [CONTACT_630792]. CSF specimens will be obtained using a protocol developed by [CONTACT_127026] a previous clinical 
trial requiring CSF sampling from an external ventricular drain.  
 
Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations.   
c. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
Breaches in confidentiality will be reported to the IRB immediately by [CONTACT_978]. All data will be

3. Abstract:  
Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) is a commonly performed corneal refractive surgery 
for the correction of refractive errors. The procedure is less popular than Laser In -Situ 
Keratomileusis (LASIK) due to increased post -operative pain and discomfort associ ated with 
PRK, but some patients and surgeons increasingly prefer PRK for its superior safety profile in 
select patients.  
Surgeons prescribe topi[INVESTIGATOR_907840] -
operative discomfort after PRK, with additional topi[INVESTIGATOR_907841]/or oral narcotics for 
break -through pain. Oral narcotic agents are typi[INVESTIGATOR_907842] -acetaminophen com binations. 
Current evidence, however, demonstrates that opi[INVESTIGATOR_907843] -
effects and that legitimate opi[INVESTIGATOR_907844]. A 
safe, effective means of post -operative pain ibcontro l is needed, and alternatives to opi[INVESTIGATOR_907845].  
We propose a crossover randomized paired -eye controlled trial to compare post -PRK 
pain control with a CBD chemovar to codeine/acetaminophen. Patients will receive PRK in each 
eye sequentially, using the CBD chemovar or codeine/acetaminophen for one eye and  the other 
treatment for the fellow eye two weeks later. This crossover paired -eye design allows for robust 
self-control. Masking treatments will not be possible given the different appearance and dosing 
regimen of treatments. Surgical and post -operative p arameters will be standardized between 
the two arms.  
Medication use, pain levels and potential side effects will be collected.  Primary outcome 
measures will be  change from baseline in daily pain intensity on the pain rating scale to 
postoperative day 4  and responses between the study medication and the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/acetaminophen combination medication . Secondary measures will be surgical, refractive 
error, and patient reported outcomes  noted at 1 and 3 months postoperatively . Final refractive 
error determinations will not be determined until 6 months postoperatively for patients having 
greater than 6D of myopia preoperatively.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949]  05/22/2024  4.  Background:  
Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a common corneal refractive surgery with a 
superior safety profile compared to Laser In -Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) for some patients but 
has increased post -operative pain and discomfort, frequently requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_907846] r post -operative 
pain control. Published evidence suggests that hemp -based cannabidiols (CBD) may be a 
suitable pain -control alternative, and we propose this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
oral CBD for reduction of PRK post -operative pain com pared to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -acetaminophen 
combinations.  
PRK is a commonly performed corneal refractive surgery for the correction of myopia, 
hyperopia and astigmatism. The procedure is not as popular as LASIK due to the increase in 
post-operative pain and discomfort associated with PRK.1-[ADDRESS_1274172] -operative discomfort after PRK. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163], non -steroidal, steroidal 
anti-inflammatory and rewetting drops are typi[INVESTIGATOR_83576]. Oral non -steroid al medications are 
employed for pain control in a fraction of patients as well.5,6 For break -through pain, patients are 
often prescribed topi[INVESTIGATOR_907841]/or oral narcotics.  
Attempts to optimize the specific constituent components of this combination approach 
have been documented in the medical literature. Variability in efficacy and side effects with 
many components has been reported. Several types of bandage contact [CONTACT_907870] -operative comfort, with senofilcon 
A offering lowest pain reports.7-[ADDRESS_1274173] lens, topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413], and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_907847].38-40 
Combination codeine/acetaminophen, hydrocodone/acetaminophen and 
oxycodone/acetaminophen are commonly used oral narcotic/analgesic combination medication 
for post -PRK pain.41 Use of transdermal fentanyl patches has been reported as well.42 Some 
evidence suggests codeine/acetaminophen may be better for post -PRK pain control than 
oxycodone containing combinations.43 However, opi[INVESTIGATOR_907848]. Unfavorable side effects including gastrointestinal 
and sensorium changes in patients taking a hydrocodone/acetaminophen combination have 
been reported.44-[ADDRESS_1274174] 
exposure to opi[INVESTIGATOR_907849] a legitimate prescription for 
an injury.49 Over 25% of select patient populations who were prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_907850]202201660  Page 3 of 12 
IRB version 03.09.04  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949]  05/22/[ADDRESS_1274175] been reported to still be using them at one year.50 Alternative treatments are 
worth consideration.  
Published evidence suggests hemp -based cannabidiol (CBD) with or without 
tetrahydrocannabidiol (THC) may be a suitable post -surgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_907851].51, 52 
CBD products with lower THC content may be preferable to higher THC -containing products 
associated with impaired cognition. Additionally Capano et al. treated a series of 131 patients 
taking more than 50 daily baseline morphine equivalents with a low -THC oral CBD chemical 
variant and found 53.2% of patients were able to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_907852].[ADDRESS_1274176] -operative 
medications.  
 
5. Specific Aims:  
 We will compare the safety and efficacy of a low -THC, oral CBD chemovar to oral 
codeine -acetaminophen for controlling post -operative PRK pain.  
 
6. Research Plan:  
 Once a patient been evaluated, has been informed of the risks and benefits of the 
procedures, their cost and has decided on PRK, then the study will be introduced to the patient 
to determine their interest in participation.  
 Up to fifty patients will be enrolled in the study with the goal of Thirty -five total patients 
completing  the study and will include otherwise healthy patients with myopia meeting criteria 
for PRK without contraindications to any of the study medications. Patients will undergo PRK in 
each eye sequentially, separated by [CONTACT_136782]. Half of the patients will receive the CBD 
chemovar for pain control during the first surgery, and half will initially receive 
codeine/acetaminophen. Both arms will then cross over  to the other pain -control treatment 
during the second surgery for the fellow eye two weeks later.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949]  05/22/2024   For the eye to be treated with the narcotic medication, patients will be prescribed 12 
tablets of codeine/acetaminophen (30mg/300mg) for break -through pain. Patients will be 
counseled that these medications may be taken as needed up to once every 4 hours (up to 18 
morphine equivalents daily), that use will preclude driving and, and that this medication may 
result in unfavorable side -effects including gastro -intestinal symptoms. Chemovars of CBD 
delivered via smoking and/or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_907853]. Sublingual tinctures were deemed to 
be potentially less reliable for precise dosing using a dropper, especially in subjects with 
impaired visual acuity in the immediate p ost-operative period.  
 For the eye to be treated with the CBD chemovar, patients will be prescribed 20 CBD 
gummies  (50mg) and instructed to use 2 of the chemovars (50mg total each dose) beginning 
the morning of the procedure and continuing twice daily through the evening dose on post -
operative day (POD) 4. The CBD chemovar selected for this study is a full spectrum CBD 
gummy  provided by  [CONTACT_907871] 50mg of CBD with less than 0. 3% THC by [CONTACT_8497] . 
This product is readily available for direct consumer purchase without administrative 
encumbrances associated with higher level THC chemovars. The cannabinoid profile is verified 
by [CONTACT_907872] a host of  chromatograph y techniques . The analysis includes 
screening for heavy metals, toxins, industrial chemicals , microbiological and pesticide 
contamination. CBD  used for this study will all be selected from the same lot to reduce 
variability. A similar strength CBD product has been used in a published clinical study53 in [ADDRESS_1274177] affects them , and that this medication may result in unfavorable side -effects including 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], decreased appetite, diarrhea, liver enzyme elevations, fatigue, malaise, rash, 
insomnia, sleep problems and infections . 
 The investigators will pursue investigational new drug approval for this CBD chemovar 
prior to treating patients.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949]  05/22/2024  There is some evidence that prolonged, high dose CBD use (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]) has resulted in 
elevated transaminases. The fraction of patients experiencing CBD -associated liver injury in the

7. Possible Discomforts and Risks:  
 Normal discomforts and risks associated with PRK for myopia may be experienced by 
[CONTACT_1962]. Patients will be receiving a pain medication for each of the surgical eyes. One pain 
medication is the acetaminophen/codeine product used for all PRK patients were Refractive 
Center standard protocol. The other eye will be treated with the CBD product. It is possible that 
subjects could experience less pain control with one or the other interventions. Based on clinical 
practice, most patients having bilateral surgery  report more pain than those having single eye 
surgery. If a subject in this study has less pain control with one of the study agents, this pain level 
is likely to be lower than that experienced by [CONTACT_907878].   
 Other discomforts and risks are similar to those experienced by [CONTACT_907879]. These can include intra -procedure anxiety and 
discomfort, post -operative pain, irritation, tearing, blurred vision, double vi sion, potential loss of 
vision and need for additional procedures.  
 Study subjects will need to have each eye treated sequentially approximately [ADDRESS_1274188] udy subjects will also be 
required to complete postoperative questionnaires after each eyes’ surgery.  
 Study medication risks are as mentioned above. For the opi[INVESTIGATOR_530374], 
use will preclude driving and use has been associated with sleepin ess, fatigue,  nausea/vomiting,  
constipation, itching, and potential for abuse. For the CBD product, use may be associated with 
somnolence, sedation , decreased appetite, diarrhea, liver enzyme elevations, fatigue, malaise, 
rash, insomnia, sleep problems and infections.  
 
8. Possible Benefits : 
 Benefits of the study could be to identify an alternative pain control regimen satisfactory for 
post-PRK pain that could reduce the need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155].

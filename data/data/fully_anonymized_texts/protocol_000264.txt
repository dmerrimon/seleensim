Thrombo -Embolism Risk (MARINER )
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPOUND
Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct acting, Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor anticoagulant that has been under 
development for the treatment of several thrombosis -mediated conditions. Rivaroxaban is marketed under 
the trade name [CONTACT_495116]®and has been approved for multiple indications worldwide. The clinical 
development program for rivaroxaban is extensive . Over 70,[ADDRESS_1167725] version of the Investigator's Brochure19.
OBJECTIVE AND HYPOTHESIS
Primary Objective
The primary objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of rivaroxab an compared with placebo in the prevention of 
symptomatic venous thromboembolism ( VTE : low er extremity deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and non -fatal 
pulmonary embolism [PE] )and VTE -related death (death due to PE or death in which PE cannot be ruled out as the 
cause) post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840240] -risk, medically ill patients .
Secondary Objectives   
The secondary objectives are to compare rivaroxaban with placebo in the following post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840241]- risk, medically ill patients:
 VTE -related death (death due to PE or death in which PE cannot be ruled out as the cause)
 Symptomatic VTE ( lower extremity DVT and non-fatal PE)
 The composite of symptomatic VTE (lower extremity DVT and non -fatal PE) and all -cause mortality 
(ACM)
 The composite of symptomatic VTE (lower extremity DVT and non -fatal PE), myocardial infarction 
(MI), non-hemorrhagic stroke and cardiovascular (CV) death (death due to a known CV cause and 
death in which a CVcause cannot be ruled out; by [CONTACT_13748], a VTE -related death is considered 
a CV death)
 ACM 
Exploratory Objectives
The exploratory objectives are to compare rivaroxaban with placebo, in the following post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840241]- risk, me dically ill patients:

Status: Approved , 31 March 2017 Symptomatic lower ex tremity DVT
 Symptomatic non -fatal PE
 Symptomatic upper extremity DVT
 MI  
 Non- hemorrhagic stroke
 Re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840242] (lower extremity DVT and non-fatal PE) within 30 days
after randomization
Pharmacokinetic Objective
The pharmacokinetic (PK) objective is to assess the kinetics of rivaroxaban in high-risk, medically ill 
patients, and to describe drug exposure based on creatinine clearance ( CrCl ). 
Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economi cs Objective
The medical resource utilization and health economics objective is to assess the following cost drivers, 
ie,re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (including emergency room [ER] visits, intensive care unit and cardiac care unit 
stays ), length of stay and subject discharge destination (after re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) .
Safety Objective s
The safety objectives are to compare rivaroxaban with placebo in the following bleeding outcomes in 
high-risk, medically ill patients :
 Major bleeding using validated International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH )
bleeding criteria.
 Non-major clinically relevant bleeding
 Other bleeding
Overall safety will also be assessed.
Hypothese s  
The primary hypothesis is that rivaroxaban is superior to placebo in the prevention of the composite of 
symptomatic VTE (lower extremity DVT and non-fatal PE) and VTE -related death (death due to PE or 
death in which PE cannot be ruled out as the cause). The secondary hypotheses are that rivaroxaban is 
superior to placebo inthe prevention of 1) VTE -related death (death due to PE or death in which PE 
cannot be ruled out as the cause) , 2) symptomatic VTE (lower extremity DVT and non-fatal PE), 3) the 
composite of symptomatic VTE (lower extremity DVT and non-fatal PE) and ACM, 4) the composite of 
symptomatic VTE (lower extremity DVT and non-fatal PE), MI, non-hemorrhagic stroke and CV death 
(death due toa known CV cause and death in which a CV cause cannot be ruled out; by [CONTACT_13748], a 
VTE -related death is considered a CV death) and 5) ACM alone .
OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN
This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, event -driven study 
designed to evaluate rivaroxaban, compared with placebo, in the prevention of symptomatic VTE 
(lower extremity DVT and non-fatal PE) events and VTE -related deaths (death due to PE or death in 
which PE cannot be ruled out as the cause) for a period of [ADDRESS_1167726]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. The study 
consists of a screening phase, a 45-day double -blind treatment phase, and a 30-day safety follow -up 
period.

(eg,atrial fibrillation) during the study is not eligible for participation. In addition, patients at particular ly 
increased risk of bleeding and those using medications that might interact with the study drug will be 
excluded. 
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to 
receive rivaroxaban or placebo. Randomization should occur on the same day as or the day after the 
subject leaves the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l,and may occur at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], clinic or other discharge destination. Subjects 
will be randomized by [CONTACT_840362].
After randomization, subjects will receive double -blind treatment with rivaroxaban 10 mg (7.5mg for 
subjects with a CrCl ≥30 mL/min and <50 mL/min) daily or matching placebo daily. Placebo has been 
chosen as the comparator because of current guidelines which recommend against thrombop rophylaxis in 
medically ill pati ents after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. The first dose of study drug shou ld be administered no later 
than the day after the subject leaves the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840248]. Subjects will 
be instructed to discontinue study drug after they take a dose on Day 45, and complete an end of treatment

Unblinding of study drug should not be necessary. Anticoagulation regimens do not require adjustment 
regardless of treatment group assigned when study drug is administered in the doses used in this study.  
There is no specific reversal agent for rivaroxaban; management of the subjec t with a bleeding event

study is analyzed that the sponsor can determine if the population at risk will benefit from treatment.
The primary efficacy outcome is the composite of all symptomatic VTE events (lower extremity DVT 
and non- fatal PE) and VTE -related death (death due to PE or death in which PE cannot be ruled out as the 
cause) , from randomization up to Day 45. The targeted total number of primary efficacy outcomes in this

randomized to either rivaroxaban or placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_1167731] not been observed by [CONTACT_221774]. An interim 
analysis for futility will be conducted when approximately 50% of subjects with adjudicated primary 
efficacy outcome events have been observed (about 50% of the expected total number of events based on 
the actual observed blinded pooled event rate even if this event rate is lower than the assumed rate). The 
principal safety outcome for this study is ISTH major bleeding.
For population PK analyses, based on the model performance and the high variability of the 
PKparameters observed in the MAGELLaN study, 2 blood samples ( at pre-dose and1-4 hours after study  
drug administration) will be collected at the Day 7 visit  and 2 blood samples (at 3 to 7 and 7 to 12 hours 
after study drug administration) will be collected at the Day [ADDRESS_1167732] for up to 
600subjects (300 rivaroxaban subjects [200 subjects in the 10 mg daily group and 100 subjects in the

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Treatment groups in this study are rivaroxaban and placebo. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 
1:1ratio to receive rivaroxaban 10 mg daily (or 7.5mg daily in subjects with CrCl ≥30 mL/min and
<50mL/min) or matching placebo daily . Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_840365] ≥30mL/min and<50 mL/min versus subjects wit h CrCl ≥50 mL/ min and by [CONTACT_1606].
The first dose of study drug should be administered no later than the day after the subject leaves the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840248]. The date and time of the first dose of study drug and 
the last dose of LMWH or UFH should be recorded as accurately as possible. The first dose of study drug 
should not be delayed to allow administration under supervision. All subjects should take study drug 
(rivaroxaban or placebo) daily with or without food at approximately the same time each day, and 
discontinue study drug after they take a dose on Day 45.Regardless of the day on which the Day 45 Visit 
occurs, no study drug may be taken after Day 45 .
A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible (up to 8 hours prior to the next scheduled dose), and 
the next scheduled dose should be taken at the regular time.
Interruption of Study Drug 
Study drug may be interrupted temporarily as necessary for invasive procedures or as medically needed 
(eg,in the setting of a bleeding event or a required prohibited therapy). If a subject ishospi[INVESTIGATOR_840253] a VTE -related event or bleeding, study drug should be continued during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840254]. Subjects may be placed on 
appropriate anticoagulation at the discretion of thetreating physician .In that case ,study drug needs to be 
temporarily interrupted and can be restarted upon discharge at the discretion of the investigator. These 
interruptions will be recorded on the electronic case report form ( eCRF).
During the study, should the subject develop any condition, which in the investigator’s judgment requires 
long-term anticoagulation thromboprophylaxis, or fibrinolysis, the subject will have study treatment 
either temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued andwill bemanaged as deemed appropriate 
by [CONTACT_1963]. The subject will be asked to continue in the study to be followed for efficacy 
and safety outcomes.
EFFICACY EVALUATIO NS/OUTCOMES
 The primary efficacy outcome is the composite of all symptomatic VTE events (lower extremity 
DVT andnon-fatal PE) and VTE -related death (death due to PE or death in which PE cannot be 
ruled out as the cause)
 The secondary efficacy outcomes are the following:
 VTE -related death (death due to PE or death in which PE cannot be ruled out as the cause)
 Symptomatic VTE ( lower ex tremity DVT and non-fatal PE)
 The composite of symptomatic VTE (lower ex tremity DVT and non- fatal PE) and ACM
 The composite of symptomatic VTE (lower extremity DVT and non-fatal PE), MI, 
non-hemorrhagic stroke and CV death (death due to a known CV cause and death in which a 
CV cause cannot be ruled out; by [CONTACT_13748], a V TE-related death is considered a CV death)
 ACM

 MI
 Non- hemorrhagic stroke
 Re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840242] (lower extremity DVT and non-fatal PE) within 
30days after randomization
Any clinical event that suggests the possibility that an efficacy outcome event has occurred (including 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS )and transient ischemic attack (TIA) will be sent for adjudication. If a 
subject has a suspected efficacy outcome event during the study, the treating physician should exercise 
clinical judgment and follow established guidelines to apply the standard of care. Unblinding of study 
drug should not be necess ary, as anticoagulation regimens do not require adjustment regardless of use of 
placebo vs rivaroxaban when administered in the doses used in this study.
SAFETY EVALUATIONS / OUTCOMES
 The principal safety outcome is major bleeding using validated ISTH bleeding criteria.
 Other safety outcomes are non- major clinically relevant bleeding and other bleeding.
Overall safety will also be assessed.
An ISTH major bleeding event is defined as overt bleeding associated with: a fall in hemoglobin of 
2g/dL or more, or leading to a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, or 
bleeding that occurs in a critical site: eg,intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, 
intramuscular with compartment synd rome, retroperitoneal, or a fatal outcome (for details on definitions 
see Section 9.5). 
Non-major clinically relevant bleeding is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major 
bleeding ,but associated with medical intervention, unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a 
physician, (temporary) cessation of study treatment, or associated with discomfort for the subject such as
pain or impairment of activities of daily life.
Other bleeding is defined as any other overt bleeding that does not meet the ISTH criteria for major or 
non-major clinically relevant bleeding. 
Any clinical event that suggests the possibility that a bleeding outcome event has occurred will be sent for 
adjudication. If a subject has a serious bleeding event during study drug treatment, routine measures 
should be considered as described in Section 9.5.2. U nblinding of study drug should not be necessary. As 
there is not a specific reversal agent for rivaroxaban, management of the subject should not be impacted 
by [CONTACT_840363].

 Two-sided significance level of 0.05. 
To observe the targeted 161 events, it is estimated that a total of approximately 8,000 subjects will need to 
be randomized to either rivaro xaban or placebo in 1:1 ratio. This estimate is based on an estimated 
placebo incidence rate of the primary efficacy outcome of 2.5%. In the event that the actual observed 
blinded pooled event rate is lower than the assumed rate, more subjects may be enrolled to accumulate 
additional outcome events. Randomization in this study may be stopped at approximately 12,[ADDRESS_1167737] occurrence 
of symptomatic VTE (lower extremity DVT and non- fatal PE) and VTE -related death (death due to PE or 
death in which PE cannot be ruled out as the cause ) in the ITT analysis setand Up-to-Day-45 analysis 
phase . The primary statistical alternative hypothesis is that rivaroxaban is superior to placebo on the 
primary efficacy outcome.
The primary statistical hypothesis will be tested using Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by 
[CONTACT_840366] ≥30 mL/min and <50 mL/min versus subjects with CrCl ≥50 mL/min, with the 
treatment (as randomized) as the only covariate. This primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT
analysis setand Up -to-Day-45 analysis phase . Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment group 
to which they are randomized, regardless of actual treatment received. As an operational arrangement, the 
2-sided p-value will be reported and if it is less than the 2-sided alpha of 0.05, then superiority of the 
study drug will be declared if the observed survival functions favor rivaroxaban.
The point estimate and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) forthe HR (rivaroxaban to placebo) 
will be provided based on the Cox proportional hazards model. For the CIs, the plausibility of 
proportional hazards assumption will be assessed by [CONTACT_840367], and additionally checked by [CONTACT_1583] a treatment by [CONTACT_47906] -transformed 
time interaction into the Cox model .  
The cumulative event rate derived from Kaplan- Meier estimate will be displayed graphically to evaluate 
the treatment effect over time. 
Homogeneity of treatment effects, both in HR and direction, will be assessed by [CONTACT_840368] (for details see Section 11.3 ). Analysis methods will be detailed in the SAP.

To control the family -wise type I error rate at alpha of 0.05 (2-sided) in testing for efficacy outcomes, if 
superiority of rivaroxaban over placebo on the primary efficacy outcome is established, superiority of 
rivaroxaban over placebo on secondary outcomes will be tested sequentially using a closed testing 
procedure in the following hierarchical order, each at alpha of 0.05 (2 -sided):
 VTE -related death (death due to PE or death in which PE cannot be ruled out as the cause)

1.1. Background
Hemostasis is a normal physiological process following damage of the vascular system.  In 
various diseases, however, the hemostatic mechanisms are inappropriately  activated with 
pathological consequences known as thrombosis. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) including 
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary  embolism (PE) represents one of the most common 
health problems. More than 2 million Americans suffer from acute VTE each year.In the 
European Union (EU), incidence rates of DVT and PE are assumed to be slightly  higher, but are 
generall y consistent with those in the [LOCATION_002] (US)9,39.Deep vein thrombosis and PE are a 
burden for healthcare systems as they areassociated with high mortality  and considerable 
morbidity  in terms of recurrent events, the post-thrombotic syndrome, and chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary  hypertension 14,22,30,43.  Treatment of DVT and PE aims at 
prevention of worsening of the existing thrombus, as well as prevention of recurrent VTE41.
Medically  ill patients, ie, patients that are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840259], are at high risk for the development of VTE during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840260]. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) 
Evidence -Based Clinical Practice Guidelines currentl y recommend anticoagulant 
thromboprophy laxis for acutel y ill hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840261] [ADDRESS_1167750] discharge could potentially 
reduce the overall risk of VTE, this approach has not yet been widel y used, likely  due to the 
challenges in administering a parenteral medication by [CONTACT_840371]

Recently , 3 studies with extended treatm ent duration of enoxaparin (EXCL AIM), api[INVESTIGATOR_9640] n 
(ADOPT) and rivaroxaban (MAGELLaN ) failed to demonstrate a positive benefit -risk profile for 
extended -duration thromboprophy laxis in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840263]10,13,15,17.
The previous trial in medicall y ill patients (the MAGELLaN study ) showed positive efficacy  
results of rivaroxaban but a bleeding risk that outweighed the benefit. Compared with thisand 
the other trials, the MARI NER trial was therefore modified to improve the overall safet y of the 
subjects by [CONTACT_840372] y studies 
while maintaining the efficacy  that was observed. Several study  design elements were modified 
to red uce the risk of major bleeding observed in the MAGELLaN study . Subjects with a baseline 
creatinine clearance (CrCl )of 30to 49 mL/min have a higher risk for bleeding . Given that a 
relativel y high number of medicall y ill patients with this lower CrCl will be enrolled, there will 
be a rivaroxaban dose adjustment for this subgroup. In addition, other high bleeding 
risk-subjects , eg,with active cancer or with clinically  significant bleeding during index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], subjects who use [ADDRESS_1167752] atelet agents or acety lsalicy lic acid (ASA )
alone at a dose >162 mg/day  or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_840264] a dose >75mg/day will be excluded . None 
of the proposed measures, ie,dose alteration and exclusion of specific subgroups, is expected to 
reduce the efficacy  of the overall study ,but they areexpected to reduce the risk of major 
bleeding in this population. Furthermore, in the present study , onl y hard efficacy  outcome s 
(eg,symptomatic VTE [lower extremity  DVT and non-fatal PE] events, VTE-related deaths
[death due to PE or death in which PE cannot be ruled out as the cause] ) will be assessed, 
compared with MAGELLaN, EXCLAIM, and ADOPT, where inclusion of asymptomatic 
proximal DVT as part of the primary  efficacy  outcome may have resulted in a less clinicall y 
meaningful evaluation (Section 3.2,Study  Design Rationale ). This Phase 3 clinical study  with 
rivaroxaban is warranted to evaluate extended thrombopro phylaxis up to 45 days after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840265]. 
The proposed Phase 3 multicenter, prospective, randomized, dou ble-blind, placebo- controlled, 
event -driven study  is designed to evaluate rivaroxaban, compared with placebo, in the prevention 
of symptomatic VTE (lower extremity  DVT and non-fatal PE) events and VTE-related deaths

1.1.2. Medically  Ill Patients - Scope of the Problem
Medically  ill patients, ie, patients that are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840259], are at high risk for the development of VTE during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840267]. The rationale for the use of thromboproph ylaxis is based on solid 
principles and scientific evidence 20. Almost all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840268], and a high proportion have 3 or more risk factors. Without thromboprophylaxis, the 
incidence of objectively -confirmed, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired DVT ranges from 10%to 40% among 
medical or general surgical patients and 40% to 60% following major orthopedic surgery . 
Thromboproph ylaxis for the prevention of VTE in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840269]20. Medicall y ill patients 
are generally  defined as patients who are acutely  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] 1of the following diseases, 
including but not limited to, heart failure (HF)with reduced ejection fraction , respi[INVESTIGATOR_840270], acute infectious diseases, neurologic diseases, inflammatory  and hematologic 
diseases, and cancer. Parenteral anticoagulatio n, including enoxaparin and UFH , are 
recommended for thromboprophy laxis in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840271], but 
thromboprophy laxis is not recommended after discharge 20.

Studies of short -term (10 to 12 days) thromboprophy laxis in medicall y ill patients showed a 
benefit for the LMWH enoxaparin administered during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (MEDENOX study ), for 
the LMWH dalteparin administered for 14 days during and after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] 
(PREVENT study ), and for the indirect Factor -Xa inhibitor fondaparinux administered during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (ARTEMIS study ) over placebo7,24,34.
A meta -analysis of 4 studies of short -term enoxaparin treatment (treatment phase , 7 to 10 days) 
compared with UFH showed similar lya substantial reduction in VTE for enoxaparin compared 
with UFH in populations of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840272], 
acute cardiovascular (CV) disease and acute ischemic stroke23. The combined incidence of VTE 
at Day 15 in this meta -analy sis was 2.6% in the enoxaparin group and 5.2% in the UFH group ;
both rates are much lower than in untreated subjects. The combined major bleeding rate at 
Day 15 reported in the studies included in this meta -analysis was 0.65% for the enoxaparin-
treated patients and 0.56% for the UFH -treated patients. Based on the clinical information 
available for acutely  ill hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840273], the ACCP
recommends anticoagulant thromboprophy laxis for 6-[ADDRESS_1167758] 3 months following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840274]36. It has been 
reported that in patie nts hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840275], the cumulative symptomatic VTE

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840277]- duration (4-week) thromboprophy laxis has been shown to significantly  reduce 
the incidence of VTE compared with a standard (1-week) regimen in high-risk surgical patients, 
extended duration thromboproph ylaxis has not been shown to be of value in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840278]. Medical patients represent most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840279] 75% of 
fatal pulmonary  emboli occur in this group5,8,12,16,31.
In the MAGELLaN study , the primary  efficacy  endpoint was a composite of events of: 
1)asymptomatic proximal DVT in a lower extremity  detected by [CONTACT_840373] , 2) sy mptomatic DVT in a lower ex tremity , proximal o r distal, 
3)symptomatic, non-fatal PE, and 4) VTE-related death. VTE-related death was defined as 
either a well-documented fatal PE, or sudden death with no other plausible explanation. The 
study  compare dVTE prophy laxis with oral rivaroxaban 10mg once daily for 35 days with 
enoxaparin 40 mg dailyfor 10days in subjects who were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] a medical illness. The 
MAGELLaN study  met both of its protocol -specified primary  efficacy  outcomes for rivaroxaban 
versus enoxaparin/placebo at both Day 10 (non-inferiorit y) and Day 35 (superiority ). At Day 35, 
at the end of the rivaroxaban -enoxaparin/placebo phase (treatment phase), rivaroxaban was 
statistically  significantl y superior to enoxaparin in the mITT Day 35 population (two-sided 
p=0.0211). The RR was 0.77 with the 95% confidence interval (CI)ranging from 0.62 to 0.96. 
The incidence rate of the primary  efficacy  composite outcome events at Day  35 was higher in the 
enoxaparin group (5.7% [175/3057]) than in the rivaroxaban group (4.4% [131/2967]) 
(mITTDay 35 population). At Day 10, at the end of the rivaroxaban -enoxaparin phase (active 
control treatment phase), rivaroxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to enoxaparin in the 
per protocol (PP)population (statistically  significant with a one-sided p=0.0025). The RR was 
0.97 with a 95% CI ranging from 0.71 to 1.31. The incidence rate of the primary  efficacy  
composite outcome events at Day 10 was identical in both treatment groups in the PP Day 10 
population (rivaroxaban, 2.7% [78/2938]); enoxaparin, 2.7% [82/2993]). However, rivaroxaban 
also increased major bleeding events. 
The CIsand p-values for the weighted relative risks of bleeding events in the 3treatment phases 
were statisticall ysignificant in favor of enoxaparin. By [CONTACT_16303], the major bleeding events in the 
rivaroxaban -enoxaparin/placebo phase (Day  1 to Day 35) were reported in 43 (1.1%) vs 
15(0.4%) subjects, in the rivaroxaban -enoxaparin phase (Day  1  to Day 10)in 24 (0.6%) vs 
11(0.3%) subjects, in the rivaroxaban- placebo phase (Day  10 to 35 )in 19 (0.5%) and 4 (< 0.1%) 
subjects in the rivaroxaban and enoxaparin groups, respectivel y. 
The EXCLAIM study  (Extended prophy laxis for VTE in acutel y ill medical patients with 
prolonged immobilization), compared an extended duration (28 day s) enoxapar in with placebo in 
patients recentl y hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840280]17. The extended -duration enoxaparin treatment was found to reduce the 
incidence of VTE compared with placebo (2.5% vs. 4%; absolute risk difference favoring 
enoxaparin, -1.53% [95.8% CI, -2.54% to -0.52%]). However, enoxaparin also increased major 
bleeding events (0.8% vs. 0.3%; absolute risk difference favoring placebo, 0.51% [95% CI,

with enoxaparin (2.71% vs. 3.06%; relative risk [RR] 0.87; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.23).  Major 
bleeding events during the30 day treatment period occurred in 0.47% of the patients in the 
api[INVESTIGATOR_840284] 0.19% of the patients in the enoxaparin group (RR2.58; 95% CI, 1.02 to

The increased bleeding associated with extended duration of therapy  was seen in all [ADDRESS_1167761]. One potential means to 
diminish the excess bleeding rates would be to identify  those patients with a more positive 
benefit/risk profile. Post-hoc analysis of the MAGELLaN study  indicated that those who 
experienced a bleeding event while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840286]. 
The selection of a high VTE- risk population is also important for the demonstration of a positive 
benefit/risk with anticoagulant therapy . Since the completion of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] [ADDRESS_1167762], the MARI NER study is 
relying on an evidence- derived, weighted, and scored clinical VTE -risk score, the IMPROVE 
VTE-risk score, alone or in combination with an elevated D-dimer toenroll a sufficiently  high 
VTE-risk cohort when compared to previous studies that would benefit from extended 
thromboprophy laxis. The IMPROVE VTE -risk score has been extensively  validated in 2 large 
external validation studies and a D-dimer >2X the upper limit of normal ( ULN )was shown to be 
a powerful predictor of VTE in the general patie nt popu lation of the MAGELLaN study  as well 
as the subgroup with CHF .11, 31, 25,[ADDRESS_1167763] to 
ensure all efficacy  events are appropriatel y captured. Pulmonary  embolism (PE) has been 
reported as the most common missed or delay ed diagnosis by  [CONTACT_13922].35,41Misdiagnosis of PE 
has been shown in the literature to occur in up to 50% of patients with PE.2Reports show that PE

1.2. Overall Rationale for the Study
The primary  objective is to assess the efficacy  and safety  of rivaroxaban, compared with placebo
in the prevention of s ymptomatic VTE (lower extremity  DVT and non- fatal PE) and VTE -related
death (death due to PE or death in which PE cannot be ruled out as the cause) post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840288]-risk medically  ill subject s.   
Three extended duration studies with enoxaparin (EXCLAIM), api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (ADOPT) and 
rivaroxaban (MAGELLaN ) failed to demonstrate a positive benefit/risk profile for extended -
duration thromboprophylaxis in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840289]10,15,17. 
Therefore, the proposed MARI NER study  was designed to improve the overall safet y of 
medically  ill patients with rivaroxaban (10 mg daily in subjects with CrCl ≥50 mL/min or 7.5mg 
daily in subjec ts with CrCl of ≥30to <50mL/min) treatment for [ADDRESS_1167765]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840290] a higher 
VTE-risk population to enhance the overall expected benefit/risk assessm ent. The proposed 
study  is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double -blind, event -driven, placebo- controlled 
study  in subject s who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] a specific acute medical illness and have other risk 
factors for VTE.  In the proposed study , a specific population of medically  ill patients at high 
risk who could benefit most from extended thromboprophy laxis has been identified.
The MARINER study is designed asa pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study , to determine if the use of the FXa 
inhibitor rivaroxaban can prevent symptomatic VTE (lower extremity  DVT and non-fatal PE)
and VTE-related death post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840240]-risk, medically  ill patients.

3.2. Study Design Rationale
Study Population 
Medically  ill patients, ie, patients who have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840259], are at high risk for the development of VTE during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840296] . These are important clinical events that profoundly  impact medicall y ill 
patients, and constitute a large burden in terms of health care provision. High -risk medicall y ill 
subjects have been chosen for this study  because post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840297] a 
useful therapeutic approach to reduce the risk of increased VTE events, morbidity  and mortality 
in these patients and would meet an unmet medical need. The pharmacology , mechanism of 
action, and previous clinical studies of rivaroxaban suggest thatrivaroxaban will reduce the risk 
of VTE events and VTE- related death (death due to PE or death in which PE cannot be ruled out 
as the cause) . The timing of enrollment, randomization and treatment phase for these subjects has 
been chosen because there is ahigh rate of VTEs and VTE -related mortal ity during this 
post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228185] , particularly  during the first 2 months after discharge18,37. Compared 
with previous studies, there are several differences in the choice ofstudy populations to reduce 
the bleeding risk (Section 1.1).
Blinding Control Study Phase/Periods Treatment Groups
This randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel- group, multicenter, event -driven 
design, is a scientificall y rigorous approach for evaluating the efficacy  and safet y of rivaroxaban 
in high-risk, medically  ill patients and meets the registration requirements for a superiorit ystudy . 
Randomization and stratification will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of subjects to 
treatment groups, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes

Status: Approved , 31 March 2017(eg, demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenl y balanc ed across treatment groups, and 
to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Subject s will be 
randomized by [CONTACT_1534] (by [CONTACT_840366] ≥30 mL/min and <50 mL/min versus subjects with 
CrCl ≥50mL/min, and by [CONTACT_1606] ). Double-b linded treatment will be implemented to reduce 
potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinical outcomes. 
There has been no well-controlled study  to date that demonstrates any anticoagulant with a 
favorable benefit/risk profile (reduction of symptomatic VTE events and VTE-related mortality 
vs increase in major bleeding) in post -discharge high -risk medically  ill patients.  
Comparator Selection
The control group in the MARI NER study  will receive placebo, a decision that was made based 
on careful consideration of the literature and existing guidelines for the standard of care practice.
Medically  ill patients are at risk for the development of VTE both when hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840298]. These 2periods of risk have been studied, are 
reported in the literature, and the ACCP has published thromboprophy laxis guidelines. 
Guidelines have been published for the inpatient period, and also for the post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840299].  
For inpatients, the ACCP recommends:
“For acutel y ill hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840273], we 
recommend anticoagulant thromboprophy laxis with LMWH, low-dose unfractionated 
heparin (LDUH) bid, LDUH tid, or fondaparinux (Grade 1B) .” 
For post -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], the ACCP recommends (emphasis added):
“In acutely  ill hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840300], we suggest against extending the duration of thromboprophylaxis
beyond the period of patient immobilization or acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].”
The ACCP Evidence -Based Clinical Practice Guidelines further recommend that during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], anticoagulant thromboprophy laxis for acutel y ill hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840301] 6 to 21 days (an evidence- based 
duration derived from the range of the durations of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_840302]). However, if full mobility  is restored while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840303], the recommendation is that thromboprophy laxis be discontinued. As such, the 
guidelines recommend that patients not receive thromboprophy laxis after discharge.  
As described in Section 1.1.[ADDRESS_1167772] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840304], and none provided evidence of a benefit/ri sk balance better than placebo. The MARINER 
study  will enroll a population at greater risk of VTE and lower risk of bleeding than previously 
studied, and will use the placebo comparator as the standard of care, as recommended by [CONTACT_941]

Clinical Protocol RIVAROXDVT3002 –Amendment INT-7
34
Status: Approved , [ADDRESS_1167773], in the MARI NER study , patients for whom 
thromboprophy laxis is p rescribed after discharge are specificall y excluded .
Based on the above, placebo has been chosen as the appropriate comparator to allow for the 
evaluation of benefit/risk of rivaroxaban as thromboprophy lactic agent in post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840305]-risk, med ically  ill patients.
Any patient with a medical condition that will require chronic use of any parenteral or oral 
anticoagulation (eg, atrial fibrillation ) during the study  is not eligible for participation. During 
the study , should the subject develop anycondition, which in the investigator’s judgment 
requires long-term anticoagulation ,thromboprophy laxis, or fibrinoly sis, the subject will have 
study  treatment either temporarily  interrupted or permanentl y discontinued and will be managed 
as deemed appropr iate by [CONTACT_1963]. The subject will be asked to continue in the 
study  to be followed for efficacy  and safet y outcomes. 
Dose Selection
The selection of a dose of 10 mg dailyof rivaroxaban is based primaril y on the results of the 
studies conducted for prophy laxis of VTEs in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement 
surgery , where 10 mg daily of rivaroxaban resulted in benefit with an acceptable risk profile .
Subjects with CrCl ≥50 mL /min will be randomly  assigned to receive rivaroxaban 10 mg dail yor 
placebo. In order to reduce the risk of bleeding in subjec ts with a baseline CrCl ≥30mL/min and
<50mL/min (estimated to be approximately  20% of study  population) , a dose adjustment of 
rivaroxaban from 10 mg daily to 7.5 mg dail y will be implemented (Section 3.1)
In the ROCKET AF study , a 25% dose reduction of rivaroxaban (15 mg daily ) was implemented 
in subjects with CrCl 30 to49 mL/min (approximately  20% of the study  population), which 
provided comparable exposure, efficacy  and safet y to that of rivaroxaban [ADDRESS_1167774] s with CrCl ≥50 mL/min29. Since the age and comorbidities of the 
subjects in the proposed MARINER study  are similar to the population studied in the 
ROCKET AF study  and based on the population PK simulations of a virtual medicall y ill 
population, a similar 25% dose reduction of rivaroxaban (from 10 mg to 7.5 mg daily ) in the 
subjects with CrCl ≥30 mL/min and <50 mL/min isa reasonable strategy. This rivaroxaban dose 
reduction in medicall y ill subjects with CrCl ≥30 mL/min and <50 mL/min is predicted to yield 
similar rivaroxaban plasma exposures to those in subjects with CrCl ≥50 mL/min at a 10 mg 
dose. Based on the achievement of similar plasma exposures, comparable efficacy  and safety 
would be expected in these 2 population subgr oups.

35
Status: Approved , 31 March 2017Choice of Efficacy Measure
The choice of the primary  efficacy  outcome is based on prior rivaroxaban trials for primary  and 
secondary  prevention of VTE events (such as DVT, PE) and VTE- related deaths. In addition, 
these outcomes are considered accepta ble and verifiable for the evaluation of prevention of VTE 
events in medicall y ill patients10,15,18. 
Asymptomatic proximal DVT, as detected on compression ultrasonography, was i ncluded as part 
of the primary  efficacy  outcome in the 3 extended -duration studies (EXCL AIM, ADOPT and 
MAGELLaN). Compression ultrasonograph y is not performed routinel y in medical patients and 
the use of this test might influence the symptomatic VTE component of the primary  efficacy  
composite outcomes15.Specifically , the performance of compression ultrasound during 
double -blind treatment likely  influencesthe subsequent natural history  of the disease by 
[CONTACT_840376] c clots. Therefore, without asymptomatic clot 
detection there will be a higher symptomatic event rate and assessment of only symptomatic 
events may provide amore clinically  meaningful evaluation of a therapeutic intervention. Thus, 
in the present study  only  hard efficacy  outcome s (symptomatic VTE events, VTE-related deaths, 
etc.) will be measured.
Choice of Safety Measures
The principal safet y outcome is major bleeding using validated ISTH bleeding criteria.
In addition, data willbe collected to ascertain non-major clinicall y relevant bleeding , defined as 
overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding, but associated with medical 
intervention , unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, (temporary ) 
cessation of study  treatment, or associated with discomfort for the subject such as pain or 
impairment of activities of daily  life, and other bleeding , defined as any  other overt bleeding that 
doesnot meet the ISTH criteria for major or non -major clinically  relevant bleeding (Section 9.5).
All serious adverse events except the study  outcomes (VTE -related death, MI, acute coronary  
syndrome [ACS], stroke, transient ischemic attack [TIA], symptomatic VTE [lower or upper 
extremity  DVT and PE], bleeding events) will be collected. Refer to Section 12.3.1 , All Adverse

5. TREA TMENT ALLOCA TION AND BLINDING
Treatment Allocation
Procedures for Ran domization and Stratification
Central randomization will be implemented in this study . Subjects will be randomly  assigned to 
1 of 2treatment groups based on a computer -generated randomization schedule prepared before 
the study  under the supervision of the sponsor. The randomization will be balanced by [CONTACT_840379] ≥30 and <50 mL/min 
versus subjects with CrCl ≥50 mL/min and by  [CONTACT_1606] . Enrollment may  be capped for subgroups 
with certain baseline characteristics (eg, index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190255], reason for index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], risk score, and index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840317]) or by [CONTACT_840380]. If a decision is made to institute cappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the site will receive a written communication 
with instructions for implementation and a request for confirmation of receipt .
The IWRSwill assign a unique treatment code, which will dictate the treatment assignment and 
matching study  drug kitsfor the subject. The requestor must use his or her own user
identification and personal identification number when contact[CONTACT_23790], and will then give 
the relevant subject details to uniquely  identify  the subject.
Blinding
The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The code s will be maintained 
within the IWRS, which has the functionality  to allow the investigator to break the blind for an 
individual subject.

Status: Approved , 31 March 2017Data that may potentially  unblind the treatment assignment ( ie,events that contribute to the 
primary  and secondary  outcome or treatment allocation ) will be handled with special care to 
ensure that the integrit y of the blind is maintained and the potential for bias is minimized. This 
can include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by [CONTACT_4520], clinical team, or others as appropriate until the time of database lock and 
unblinding.  
Unblinding
Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken until all subjects have completed 
the study and the database is finalized . Otherwise, the blind should be broken only if specific 
emergency  treatment/course of action would be governed by [CONTACT_840381]. In such cases, the investigator may determine the treatment 
assignment or allocation by [CONTACT_840382] I WRS .It is recommended that the investigator contact 
[CONTACT_97499], before breaking the 
blind. 
Telephone contact [CONTACT_97500] 24hours per day , 7days per 
week. In the event the blind is broken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The 
date, time, and reason for the unblinding must be documented by [CONTACT_840383]. The documentation received from the IWRSindicating the code break must be 
retained with the subject's source documents in a sec ure manner.
Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unbli nded may continue on study  drug unless 
the subject meets a study  drug temporary  interruption or permanent discontinuation criterion.
Investigators should not disclose treatment assignment to the subject whenever possible.  
In general, randomization codes will be disclosed fully  only if the study is completed and the 
clinical database is closed. However, if an interim analy sis is specified, the randomization codes 
and, if required, the translation of randomization codes into treatment and control groups will be 
disclosed to those authorized and only  for those subjects included in the interim anal ysis.
If a subject has a suspected efficacy  or bleeding outcome event during the study , the treating 
physician should exercise clinical judgment and follow established guidelines to apply  the 
standard of care. Unblinding of study  drug should not be necessary . Anticoa gulation regimens do 
not require adjustment regardless of treatment group assigned when study  drug is administered in 
the doses used in this study . There is no specific reversal agent for rivaroxaban; management of 
the subject with a bleeding event should not be impacted by [CONTACT_840375].
If despi[INVESTIGATOR_200089], the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to unblind 
study  drug, the investigator may determine the treatment assignment or allocation by [CONTACT_840384] y noted.

study  drug will not be adjusted in the event of change in CrCl between the 2strata during the 
course of the stud y.
The first dose of study  drug should be administered no later than the day after the subject leaves 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840248]. The date and time of the first dose of 
study  drug and the last dose of LMWH or UFH should be recorded as accuratel y as possible. The 
first dose of study  drug should not be delay ed to allow administration under supervision. All 
subjects should take study  drug (rivaroxaban or placebo) daily with or without food at 
approximat ely the same time each day, and discontinue study  drug after they take a dose on 
Day45.Regardless of the day on which the Day 45 Visit occurs, no study drug may be taken 
after Day 45.
A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible (up to 8 hours prior to the next scheduled 
dose), and the next scheduled dose should be taken at the regular time.
After thesubject takes a dose of study  drug on Day 45, the subject should discontinue study  drug 
and complete the Day 45 (+4d ) visit (refer to TIME AND EVENTS SCHEDULE ). Regardless 
of the day on which the Day 45 Visit occurs, no study drug may be taken after Day 45.
Throughout the study , study  drug will be dispensed at appropriate intervals 
(see the TIME AND EVENTS SCHEDUL E) to ensure that subjects have adequate quantities of 
study  drug between study  visits. In addition, study  site personnel will instruct subjects on how to 
store study  drug for at-home use as indicated for this protocol. The storage recommendation for 
rivaroxaban or placebo is at room temperature (approximately  15to 30C).

Day 1/Day of Randomization
If the subject meets all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, he or she is eligible to 
be randoml y assigned to receive rivaroxaban or placebo at the Day 1visit. 
Randomization should occur on the day the subjec t leaves the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ;randomization will also 
be permitted the day after the subject leaves the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Randomization may occur at the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], clinic or other discharge destination .
At the rando mization visit, before randomization occurs, site staff must review the visit schedule 
and the importance of completing the study  with both the subject and any family  members 
present.  Randomization should not occur if the subject:
does not have transporta tion to study  visits
does not believe they  will have sufficient support to comply  with the protocol
is being discharged to a destination other than home and acceptability  of study 
participation has not been confirmed with the accepting ph ysician
post-discharge anticoagulation or thromboprophy laxis is planned
Also, before randomization occurs, site staff should review eligibility  criteria, including 
concomitant medications administered during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840325].  
Particular attention should be paid to ensure that acceptable types and doses of 
thromboprophy laxis were used during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and that prohibited medications 
were not administered and are not planned.
After randomization, the first dose of study  drug should be administered as soon as possible and 
no later than the day after the subject leaves the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The time of the first dose should be 
recor ded as accuratel y as possible. The first dose also should not be delay ed to allow 
administration under supervision. The first dose does not need to be delay ed because of the 
recent administration of LMWH or UFH. The administration date and time of the first dose of 
study  drug will be recorded in the source document and eCRF. The subject will be instructed to 
take study drug daily through Day 45. Regardless of the day on which the Day 45 Visit occurs, 
no study drug may be taken after Day 45 .
Also, at the randomization visit, the importance of reporting signs and sy mptoms associated with 
bleeding, DVT and PE will be stressed. Subjects and family  members, as appropriate, will be 
counseled and given educational material on the signs and symptoms associated with DVT, PE 
and bleeding .

9.2.1. Efficacy  Evaluations, Outcomes and A djudication
This is a clinical outcomes study. The primary  efficacy  outcome is the composite of all 
symptomatic VTE events ( lower extremity  DVT andnon-fatal PE) and VTE- related death (death 
due to PE or death in which PE cannot be ruled out as the cause) . 
Secondary  efficacy  outcomes are:
VTE-related death (death due to PE or death in which PE cannot be ruled out as the cause)
Symptomatic VTE ( lower ex tremity  DVT and non-fatal PE)
The composite of s ymptomatic VTE (lower extremity  DVT and non- fatal PE) and ACM
The composite of symptomatic VTE (lower extremity  DVT and non-fatal PE), MI, 
non-hemorrhagic stroke and CV death ( death due to a known CV cause and death in which a 
CV cause cannot be ruled out; by [CONTACT_13748], a VTE- related death is considered a CV 
death)

Exploratory  efficacy  outcomes are:
Symptomatic lower ex tremity  DVT 
Symptomatic non-fatal PE
Symptomatic upper extremity  DVT
MI
Non-hemorrhagic stroke

Submission of a suspected event for adjudication will be required for:
All deaths
Suspected events that include sy mptoms or signs suggestive of PE or DVT.
Performance of any imaging or other diagnostic study  that could yield an incidental 
diagnosis of PE or DVT.  
Suspected events that include acute coronary  syndrome or MI. Chest pain determined not to 
be cardiac in origin does not need to be sent for adjudication.
Suspected events that include symptoms compatible with a TIAor stroke. Events 
determined not to be a TIA or stroke (eg, seizure, hypogly cemia) do not need to be sent for 
adjudication.
Any clinical event that suggests the possibility  that an efficacy  outcome event has occurred 
(including ACS and TIA) should be indicated on the Clinical Status page of the eCRF and will 
be sent for adjudication. Examples of objective testing diagnostic procedures that may  have been
performed as part of the standard of care are listed inAttachment 2. For imaging studies, a copy 
of the original study  should be sent with the adjudication package. For other tests, a repor t of the 
results will suffice. All clinical data must be sent to CEC for adjudication. The CEC may  request 
additional imaging in order to ensure appropriate adjudication. The CEC will apply  the 
definitions (seeAttachment 1) contained in the CEC charter to adjudicate and classify  the events 
while blinded to treatment assignment. Adjudicated results will be used for final anal yses.
9.2.2. Approach to the Subject with an Efficacy  Outcome Event
If a subject has a suspected efficacy  outcome event during the study , the treating physician 
should exercise clinical judgment and follow established guidelines to apply  the standard of 
care. At the treating physician’s discretion, the routine measures described below may be 
considered.
Temporaril y interrupt or permanentl y discontinue study  drug treatment as clinic ally 
indicated. Unblinding of study  drug should not be necessary , as anticoagulation regimens 
do not require adjustment regardless of treatment group assigned when study  drug is 
administered in the doses used in this study .
Perform necessary  diagnostic procedures and consider the usual treatment measures for VTE
and/or cardiac ischemic events if phy sical examination and diagnostic testing suggest benefit 
could be obtained.
After clinical evaluation of the suspected efficacy  outcome event is completed restarting study 
drug may be considered if none of the conditions requiring permanent discontinuation are 
present (Section 10.2.3 , Permanent Discontinuation of Study  Treatment ), and after consultation 
with the medical monitor. In the event that a decision is made to restart study  drug 
(Section 10.2.1 , Temporary  Interruption of Study  Treatment ), guidelines for restarting study  drug

9.3. Pharmacokinetics 
9.3.1. Evaluations
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at selected countries and sites that can provide the 
logistical requirements necessary  for the PKsampling. Fasting is not required tovalidate the
population PKmodel. Four sparse blood samples will be collected at 2visits for about 
600subjects (300 subjects in rivaroxaban subjects [200 subjects in the 10 mg daily and 100 in 
the 7.5 mg daily group] and 300 in the placebo group) (Table 3and Table 4).These data will be 
used to describe drug exposure. Blood samples (2.0 mL each) for determination of rivarox aban 
plasma concentrations will be collected at the time points indicated in the TIME AND EVENTS 
SCHEDUL E. The exact date and time of the administration of the current dose (plus the 2 
preceding doses) and the precise actual time of blood sample collection must be accuratel y 
documented in the eCRF or laboratory  requisition form, as appropriate. The PKsub-study  will 
only be conducted at specific sites (ie,those that have the capability  to draw, process, and store 
the PKsamples), where all subjects screened will be given the choice to participate. For the PK
sample population, drug should alway s be taken in the morning. At the Day [ADDRESS_1167800] be 
recorded and there needs to be a minimum of 3 hours between sample collection s. Subjects may 
be confined to the study site during PKsampling, if considered appropriate. Samples will be 
used to evaluate the PKs of rivaroxaban ( Attachment 3).

discharge destination (after re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). 
9.5. Safety  Evaluations and Outcomes  
9.5.1. Bleeding Events
The study  will include the following evaluations of safet y and tolerability  according to the time 
points provided in the TIME AND EVENTS SCHEDUL E:ISTH major bleeding, non-major 
clinically  relevant bleeding ,other bleeding, adverse events, and clinical laboratory  tests.  
The study  will use the ISTH Bleeding Event Classification Scale to assess bleeding events as 
major, non-major clinically  relevant bleeding , or other bleeding .Similar to efficacy  outcome s, 
the same independent CEC will adjudicate and classify  bleeding events according to definitions 
in the CEC charter. The CEC will also classify  bleeding events using the Bleeding Academic 
Research Consortium scale as a supportive approach.27
The principal safet y outcome for this study  is major bleeding using validated ISTH bleeding 
criteria. Other safet y outcomes are non- major clinically  relevant bleeding and other bleeding .
An ISTH major bleeding event is defined as overt bleeding that is associated with:
A fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more, or
A transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, or
A critical site: intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, 
intramuscular with compartment sy ndrome, retroperitoneal, or 
A fatal outcome

Examples of non -major clinically  relevant bleeding are:
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_495053] 5 minutes, if it is repetitive (ie,2 or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_335276], ie,not spots on a handkerchief, within 24 hours), or leads to an intervention 
(packing, electrocautery , etc.)
Gingival bleeding if it occurs spontaneousl y (ie, unrelated to tooth brushing or eating), or if 
it lasts for more than 5 min utes
Hematuria if it is macroscopic, and either spontaneous or lasts for more than 24 hours after 
instrumentation ( eg,catheter placement or surgery) of the urogenital tract
Macroscopic gastrointestinal hemorrhage: at least 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_840329], if 
clinically  apparent
Rectal blood loss, if more than a few spots
Hemopty sis, if more than a few speckles in the sputum, or
Intramuscular hematoma
Subcutaneous hematoma if the size is larger than 25 cm2or larger than 100 cm2if provoked
Multiple source bleeding
Other bleeding is defined as any  other overt bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_840330] d onot meet the ISTH criteria 
for major or non -major clinically  relevant bleeding.
Details of all bleeding events will be captured in the eCRF.
All suspected bleeding even ts will be submitted for adjudication.
9.5.2. Approach to the Subject with a Bleeding Event
If a subject has a serious bleeding event during study  drug treatment, the following routine 
measures should be considered: 
Delay  the next study  drug administration, or discontinue treatment if indicated. Rivaroxaban 
has a plasma half-life of approximately  5to9hours, and in some subject s up to [ADDRESS_1167803] should not be impacted by  [CONTACT_840375].
Consider the usual treatment measures for bleeding event s, including fluid replacement and 
hemody namic support, blood transfusion, and fresh frozen plasma, if physical examination 
and laboratory  testing suggest benefit could be obtained.
Consider that other causes besides antithrombotic medication can be contri butory  to the 
seriousness of the bleeding event (i.e., rule out disseminated intravascular coagulation,

medications, etc.), and treat accordingl y.
If bleeding cannot be c ontrolled by  [CONTACT_221732], consider administration of 1 of the following 
procoagulants (according to the dosages advised in their respective package inserts) .43
Activated prothrombin complex concentrate 
Prothrombin complex concentrate 
Recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven®)
Any products administered to control bleeding should be entered in the CRF.
Note: Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity  of 
rivaroxaban. There is currentl y no scientific rationale for benefit, or experience with systemic 
hemostatics (eg, desmopressin, aprotinin, and epsilon aminocaproic acid).
After resolution of the bleeding event, restarting study  drug may be considered based on the 
clinical judgment of the investigator.  
9.5.3. Other Safety  Assessments
Adverse Events
Adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_423] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, 
or the subject's legall y acceptable representative) for the duration of the study . Adverse events 
will be followed by  [CONTACT_23803] 12, Adverse Event Reporting.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Separate laboratory  screening tests are not expected to be performed by [CONTACT_840404]’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495056]. No pre-specified laboratory  tests will be 
performed for the duration of the study . However, these subjects are likely  to have local 
laboratory  tests performed during their index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Any laboratory  test along with 
reference ranges relevant to a serious adverse event or an outcome event should be recorded on 
the appropriate eCRF page.
The following tests results with reference ranges will be obtained from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54998] /local laboratory  at the time of the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:
hematology

amount (1 mL) of fluid slightly  greater than the dead space volume of the lock will be removed 
from the cannula and discarded before each blood sample is taken. After blood sample 
collection, the cannula should be managed per local practice.
Refer to the TIME AND EVENTS SCHEDULE for the timing and frequency  of all sample 
collections.
10. SUBJECT COMPLETION/W ITHDRA WAL
10.1. Completion
The total duration for a subject who completes the study  after randomization is expected to be 
75days.
All feasible efforts and measures will be made to collect complete vital status and other outcome 
data from randomization to the Day 75 (±5d) visit for each subject randomized in this study , 
regardless of compliance with study  drug or visits. For subjects who are lost to follow -up or 
withdraw consent from the study , efforts will be made to obtain their vital status and other 
outcomes from permitted sources.  
It is important to note that withdrawal of consent does not withdraw permission to collect vital 
status and other outcomes. Withdrawal of permission to collect vital status and other outcomes
must be made separately . In cases where subjects indicate they do not want to “continue”, 
investigators must determine whether this refers to discontinuation of study  treatment (the most 
common expected scenario), unwillingness to attend follow -up visits, unwillingness to have 
telephone contact, unwillingness to have any contact [CONTACT_834336], or unwillingness to 
allow contact [CONTACT_4490] a third party  (eg,family member, doctor). In all cases, every  effort must be 
made to continue to follow the subject, and vital status and other outcome smust be determined 
for all randomized subjects.
10.2. Discontinuation of Study Treatment
If a subject's study  treatment must be discontinued before the end of the double -blind treatment 
phase, the subject must continue to be followed for efficacy  and safety  outcome s.
During the study , should the subject develop any condition, which in the inve stigator’s judgment 
requires long-term anticoagulation thromboprophy laxis, or fibrinol ysis, the subject will have 
study  treatment either temporarily  interrupted or permanentl y discontinued and will be managed 
as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1963]. The subject will be asked to continue in the 
study  to be followed for efficacy  and safet y outcomes.

anticoagulation during the re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], study  drug needs to be temporarily  interrupted, and 
can be resumed upon hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Mechanical methods of prophy laxis may  be used during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. If this method is chosen, study  drug may  be continued.
In addition, the study  drug should be temporaril y interrupted if the subject: 
Develops any medical condition that may require use of anticoagulant therap y, 
thromboprophy laxis, fibrinoly sis or poses an increased bleeding risk.
Undergoes percutaneous coronary  intervention, coronary  artery  by[CONTACT_9292], any other 
interventional procedure, that may require use of anticoagulant therapy , 
thromboprophy laxis, or poses an increased bleeding risk. For temporary  interruption of 
study  drugfor an elective procedure or surgery, it is suggested that investigators follow 
measures in Table 4and Table 5(Section 10.2.2 Approach to Subjects with Temporary 
Interruption of Study  Treatment ).
Experiences a major bleeding event other than intracranial bleeding. For less severe bleeding 
events, investigator discretion is allowed. If possible ,study  drug should be resumed when 
the bleeding event has resolved and the cause has been identified and corrected.
If a subject develops a new neurologic deficit or significant alteration in mental status
suggesting a cerebral vascular accident . Once a diagnosis is definitively  made and 
appropriate treatment is provided, the study  drug may be restarted at the discretion of the 
investigator.
Develops a platelet count less than 50,000/µL .If a repeat platelet count is obtained, and the 
result indicates that the abnormal platelet count was spurious, study  drug may be restarted.  
If the finding was not spurious, study  drug may be restarted after 2 consecutive values 
greater than 75,000/µL at least [ADDRESS_1167806] been obtained.
Has a serious adverse event that is considered by  [CONTACT_685429], or 
exacerbated b y, stud y drug administration.
Requires a prohibited therap y on a temporary  basis (see Section 8, Prestudy  and

10.2.3. Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment
If a subject must be permanentl y discontinued from study  drug before the end of the 
double -blind treatment phase , this will not result in automatic withdrawal of the subject from the 
study , and the subject should continue to be followed for efficacy  and safet y outcomes (for 
details see Section 3.1).
A subject should be permanently  discontinued from study  drug if:
The investigator believes that for safet y reasons ( ie,adverse event) it is in the best interest of 
the subject to stop study  drug.
The subject develops any condition which requires anticoagulation or thromboprophy laxis 
extending bey ond the treatment phase of the stud y (eg, atrial fibrillation, VTE).
The subject becomes pregnant.
The subject has a fall in CrCl to below 20 mL/min or 2 consecutive m easurements less than 
30 mL/min at least 1week apart (as calculated by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault formula , see 
Section 9.1.2 )during the study . 
The subject requires hemofiltration or dialy sis on a permanent basis
The subject requests to discontinue study  drug permanently
The subject has a hemorrhagic stroke, or intracranial bleeding
If the subject permanently  discontinues study  drug before Day 45, he/she should be instructed to 
complete an unscheduled visit and theremaining scheduled visits, including the Day 7 and 
Day 21 visits (if not yet completed), and Day 45 (+4d) and Day 75 (±5d) visits (Section 9.1.3 ). 
The Day 45visit should be a clinic visit; the Day 75visit may  be a telephone visit. 
The eCRF is to be completed to identify  the reason for permanent discontinuation of study  drug. 
The investigat or will provide a narrative to describe any adverse events that occur up to the 
Day75 (±5d) visit. The appropriate adverse event or serious adverse event sections of the eCRF

(within 24 hours) is also required as outlined in Section 12.3.[ADDRESS_1167809] will be withdrawn from the study  for any  of the following reasons:
Lost to follow -up (only after all means of all subsequent contact, including locator services 
where permitted by [CONTACT_2371], up until the Day 75 (±5d ) visit, have been exhausted ,lost to 
follow -upwill be declared). 
Withdrawal of consent (unless specificall y refused by [CONTACT_423], subject contact [CONTACT_840405] 75 (±5d ) visit ).
If a subject is lost to follow -up, every  reasonable effort must be made by [CONTACT_43757]/withdrawal. The measures 
taken to follow up must be documented. 
Study  drug assigned to the withdrawn subject may not be assigned to another subject. Subje cts 
who withdraw will not be replaced.
If a subject withdraws consent from study  or is lost to follow -up, his or her vital status and other 
outcomes will be collected at the Day 75 (±5d )visit either by [CONTACT_52062], or if 
applicable, by a  review of the subject’s medical or public records unless this contact [CONTACT_690318] b y local regulations.
11. STATISTICA L METHODS
Statistical analy sis will be done by  [CONTACT_469981] y of the sponsor. 
A general description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy  and safet y of 
the study  drug is outlined below. A more detailed SAP,including detailed censoring rules for 
time to event analy ses and imputation rules for missing or partially  missing dates, will be 
provided in a separate document that will be finalized before the first subject is randomized.  
Summaries by [CONTACT_840406]. No imputation will be 
applied, unless specified otherwise in the SAP. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will be used to summarize continuous variables. 
Counts and percentages will be used to summarize categorical variables. Kaplan -Meier method 
will be used to summarize time-to-event variables. Graphical data displays may also be used to 
summarize the data.
Unless stated otherwise, all statistical tests will be interpreted at a nominal (that is, without 
adjustment for multiplicity ) 2-sided significance level of 0.05 and all CIs at a nominal 2-sided 
level of 95% .
Adjudicated results on efficacy  and safety  outcome swill be used for the interim and final 
analyses.

Status: Approved , 31 March 2017To observe the targeted 161 events, it is estimated that a total of approximately  8,000 subjects 
will need to be randomized to either rivaroxaban or placebo in 1:1 ratio. This estimate is based 
on an estimated placebo incidence rate of the primary  efficacy outcome of 2.5%. In the event that 
the actual observed blinded pooled event rate is lower than the assumed rate, more subjects may 
be enrolled to accumulate additional outcome events. Randomization in this study  may be 
stopped at approximately 12,[ADDRESS_1167813] not been observed by [CONTACT_221774]. The total number of VTE-related death events may 
also be taken into account when deciding to stop randomization.
The above assumptions are based on obser vations from the MAGELLaN study  and the

CIs from analyses of efficacy and safety  outcome s and from subgroup and sensitivity  anal yses. 
The point estimate and corresponding 95% CIfor the HR (rivaroxaban to placebo) will be 
provided based on the Cox proportional hazards model. For the CIs, the plausibility  of 
proportional hazards assumption will be assessed by [CONTACT_176445] y comparing the plot of the log of

11.7. Interim A nalysis
An interim analy sis for futility  will be conducted when approximately  50% of subjects with 
adjudicated primary  efficacy  outcome events have been observed (about 50% of the expected 
total number of events based on the actual observed blinded pooled event rate even if this event 
rate is lower than the assumed rate) and there will be no alpha adjustment to the final analy sis.
The IDMC will review results of theplanned interim analy sis and make a recommendation 
whether the study  should be continued as planned, modified, or terminated prematurely  due to 
futility or safety .
The study  may be stopped early  for futility  when it would be unlikely  to establish superiority  on 
the primary  efficacy  outcome and/or a positive benefit over risk of rivaroxaban compared with
placebo, if the study  were to run to completion.  Detailed characteristics of non-binding futility  
criteria will be specified in the SAP.
11.8. Benefit -Risk A nalysis
The benefit -risk of rivaroxaban vs placebo will be evaluated based on the excess number of 
events between treatments for events intended to be prevented (benefits) and events that may be 
caused (risks). Excess number of events is defined as the difference in event rate times a 
hypothetical population size (eg, 10,000 patients). To have a comprehensive benefit -risk 
evaluation, several comparisons will be considered. One analy sis will be based on a comparison 
between the primary  efficacy  outcome (the composite of symptomatic VTE (lower extremity  
DVT and non -fatal PE) and VTE-related death (death due to PE and death in which PE cannot be 
ruled out as the cause) up to Day [ADDRESS_1167819]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]) and the principal safet y outcome 
(the ISTH major bleeding). This analysis phase includ es all data from randomization to Day 45 
(inclusive), which is the period of treatment. In addition, benefit -risk balance may be further 
assessed for secondary  efficacy  outcomes in relation to major bleeding, while potentially  taking 
into consideration theclinical importance of those events, eg,in the context of irreversible harm. 
The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to display  and evaluate the benefits and risks over time. 
Also a bivariate approach to benefit -risk assessment will be explored.21Additional details for 
benefit -risk anal ysis will be specified in the SAP.

16. ETHICA L ASPECTS
16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations
Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study  and, during the 
study , subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue 
participation. They  will be told that their consent to participate in the study  is voluntary  and may  be 
withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they 
would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and 
potential adverse events of the study , and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled.   
This study  was designed to closely  mimic current clinical practice of discontinuing anticoagulation 
at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Over 90% of post-discharge patients do not continue thromboprophy laxis 
with anticoagulants. Furthermore, thromboprophylactic treatment is limited by [CONTACT_840411][INVESTIGATOR_389964] (see Section 1.1). As VTE events still occur post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190311], there 
is a need to evaluate the current standard of care. A placebo comparator group is therefore justified 
to evaluate this post-discharg e treatment paradigm. The bleeding risk will be reduced in this high 
risk medicall y ill population through dose adjustment and exclusion of patient subgroups with a 
comparativel y higher bleeding risk, eg,active cancer (see Exclusion Criteria Section 4.2). 
Any subject with a medical condition that requires use of any parenteral or oral anticoagu lation 
(eg, atrial fibrillation ) during the study  is not eligible for participation. During the study , should the 
subject develop any condition which in the investigator’s judgment requires anticoagulation , 
fibrinol ysis,or thromboprophy laxis, the subject will have study  treatment discontinued and will be 
manag ed as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1963]. The subject will be asked to continue in 
the study  to be followed for efficacy  and safet y outcomes.

17.6. Data Quality  Assurance/Quality  Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy  and reliability  of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study  sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and 
study -site personnel before the study , andperiodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_456], and direct 
transmission of clinical laboratory  data from a central laboratory  into the sponsor's data base. 
Written instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples. 
Guidelines for CRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study -site personnel before 
the start of the study .The sponsor will review CRFs for accuracy  and completeness during on-
site monitoring visits and after their return to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved 
with the investigator or designee, as appropriate. The data will be entered into the study  database 
and verified for accuracy and con sistency  with the data sources. 
17.7. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all CRFs 
and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study  
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s). 
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be 
retaine d for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_43785]. It is the responsibility  of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

Status: Approved , [ADDRESS_1167837] be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877]. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study  
documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor.
If it becomes necessary  for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory  authority  to review any 
documentation relating to this study , the investigator/institution must permit access to such 
reports.
17.8. Monitoring   
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will 
record dates of the vis its in a study  site visit log that will be kept at the study  site.  At these visits, 
the monitor will compare a sample of the data entered into the CRFs with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43718] (source documents).  The nature and location of all source document s will be identified 
to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the CRF are known to the sponsor 
and study -site personnel and are accessible for verification by [CONTACT_43786] -site contact. If 
electronic records are maintained at the study  site, the method of verification must be discussed 
with the study -site personnel. 
Remote data surveillance will be performed to monitor the study .  Key  subject demographic data, 
site performance data and other key variable data will be monitored remotely  as part of routine 
data surveillance on a monthly  basis for all sites and be compared to the results seen overall for 
that country  and region. Sites identified as having subjects with data that deviates substantially  
from the norm may  also be subj ect to additional in- person monitoring visits.  
Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of 
verify ing that the data recorded in the CRF are consistent with the original source data.  Findings 
from this review of eCRFs and source documents will be discussed with the study -site personnel. 
The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be 
available, the source documentation will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be 
provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a 
regular basis during the study  to provide feedback on the study  conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during 
these remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress 
of the study  at the site.  
17.9. Study Completion/Termination
17.9.1. Study Completion
The study  is considered completed with the last study  assessment for the last subject 
participating in the study . The final data from the study  site will be sent to the sponsor 
(ordesignee) after completion of the final subject assessment at that study  site, in the time frame 
specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement.

collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the i ntended termination.
Reasons for the early closure of a study  site by [CONTACT_11004]:
Failure of the investigator to comply  with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/I RB or 
local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines
Inadequate recruitment of subjects by  [CONTACT_093]
Discontinuation of further study  drug development
17.10. On-Site A udits
Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality  assurance department may visit the study  siteat 
any time during or after completion of the study  to conduct an audit of the study  in compliance 
with regulatory  guidelines and company  policy . These audits will require access to all study 
records, including source documents, for inspection and compari son with the CRFs. Subject 
privacy  must, however, be respected. The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible 
for being present and available for consultation during routinely  scheduled study -site audit visits 
conducted b y the sponsor or its designees. 
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_23865], either as 
part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study  in support of a 
regulatory  submission. The investigator should immediat ely notify  the sponsor if he or she has 
been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y a regulatory agency  concerning an upcoming inspection.
17.11. Use of Information and Publication
All information, including but not limited to information regarding rivaroxaban or the sponsor's 
operations (eg,patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, prior 
clinical data, formulation information) supplied by [CONTACT_43787], and any data, including exploratory research data, generated as a result of 
this study , are considered confidential and remain the sole propert y of the sponsor. The 
investigator agrees to maintain this information in confidence and use this information only to 
accomplish this study , and will not use it for other purposes without the sponsor's prior written 
consent.
The investigator understands that the information developed in the study will be used by [CONTACT_495110] , and thus may  be disclosed 
as requir ed to other clinical investigators or regulatory  agencies. To permit the information

performance or specific expertise related to the nature and the key assessment parameters of the 
study  will be used to determine a coordinating investigator. Results of exploratory  analyses 
performed after the Clinical Study  Report has been issued will bereported in a separate report 
and will not require a revision of the Clinical Study  Report. Study  subject identifiers will not be 
used in publication of results. Any  work created in connection with performance of the study  and 
contained in the data that can benefit from copyright protection (except any publication by [CONTACT_23868]) shall be the propert y of the sponsor as author and owner of 
copy right in such work.
Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal 
Editors guidelines, the sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary  (multicenter) data 
and information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to publish 
study  site-specific data after the prima ry data are published. If an investigator wishes to publish 
information from the study , a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review 
at least 60days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be 
arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by [CONTACT_170196], the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60days to allow 
for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity  or 
regulatory  compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The sponsor 
will not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress 
information. For multicenter study designs and substudy  approaches, secondary  results generall y 
should not be published before the primary  outcome s of a study  have been published. Similarly , 
investigators will recognize the integrity  of a multicenter study  by [CONTACT_840415], within 12 months of the availability  of the final data (tables, 
listings, graphs), or the sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study  publication. 
Authorship of publications resulting from this study  will be based on the guidelines on 
authorship, such as those described in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to 
Biomedical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant 
contribution to the design of the study  or analy sis and interpretation of the data, provided critical 
review of the paper, and given final approval of the final version.
Registration of Clinical Studies and Disclosure of Results
The sponsor will register and/or disclose the existence of and the results of clinical studies as 
required b y law.

Status: Approved , 31 March 2017Attachment 3: Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection and Handling
Materials and Labeling
Blood must be collected in glass or plastic blood collection tubes (eg,Vacutainer®) containing appropriate 
anticoagulants. Resulting plasma samples must be stored in polypropylene storage tubes. No tubes with 
separation gel should be used.
Use of alternative materials will not result in a protocol amendment if preapproved by [CONTACT_840421]-analysis 
Scientist.
All tubes and containers will be labeled with preprinted labels. The preprinted information will include 
the study number, CRF identification number (CRF I.D.  #), treatment arm or treatment period, scheduled 
sampling day and time as stipulated in the flow chart, and the analyte name [CONTACT_327739]. No other 
information will be written on the labels. Labels should be attached to the storage tubes at least 12 hours 
before being frozen to ensure proper adherence.
Labels should be applied to the sample tubes as follows:
Apply  labels to the sample tubes so that they  do not o verlap and obscure any information. 
If possible, expose an area between the 2 ends of the label to allow viewing of the 
contents of the tube.
Do not alter the orientation of the label on the sample tube.
Apply  labels to all tubes in the same manner.
Prepar ation of Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples for Rivaroxaban
Collect 2 mL  of blood into the appropriate K 2EDTA -containing collection tube ( eg,
Vacutainer) at each time point.
Record the exact date and time of sampling in the CRF.
Gently  invert the tubes [ADDRESS_1167860] mixing, before processing.
Centrifuge blood samples at room temperature within 1 hour of collection in a clinical 
centrifuge at 1,300 g for 15 minutes or centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1,500 -1,600 g, 
unless otherwise specified by  [CONTACT_4497], to yield approximately  1 mL of plasma from 
each 2 mL whole blood sample.
Transfer all separated plasma immediately  with a clean, disposable glass or poly ethylene 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462] (use 1 new pi[INVESTIGATOR_479249]) to a pre- labeled storage tube (1.8 mL NUNC 
tubes ).
Store plasma samples in an upright position in a fr eezer, at a set temperature of -20°C 
until transfer to the bio -analy tical facilit y.
The time between blood collection and freezing the plasma will not exceed 2 hours.
Ship specimens according to the ins tructions provided.
Ship specimens to the bio- analytical facility , sorted by  [CONTACT_1130], by  [CONTACT_840422].
Questions regarding handling the plasma PK specimens should be addressed to the 
contact [CONTACT_107332].
Alternative procedures will not result in a protocol amendment if approved by  [CONTACT_840423].

The overall reason for the amendment: The overall reasons for the a mendment are to modify study procedures 
(including the risk score criterion) and to add patient training material.  
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: Emerging literature has indicated that the required risk score of the subjects enrolled w ere not sufficient 
to attain the desired event rate. Because the outcome events are all symptomatic in this study, additional site and

Rationale: Modified inclusion criteria to enrich for subjects w ith higher level of risk of VTE and to align with 
standard of care for stroke patients.
4. SUBJECT POPULATION, 
Section 4.1 Inclusion Criteria.Consent language was changed to allow  for screening to occur any time after 
admission of index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840255].  
For Sections 4.1. Inclusion Criteria, 4.2. Exclusion Criteria and 4.3. Prohibitions 
and Restrictions, detailed protocol am endm ent m odifications are described in 
Attachment 6, and a shorter version is provided in -text.
Inclusion Criterion # 1. 
The allow ed duration of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840344] 14 to 10 days.
Detail was added regarding the type and extent of CHF present to be eligible for 
the study.  Patients with preserved ventricular function will not be enrolled 
because of the low er risk of VTE than in patients with reduced ventricular 
function.
In the previous version of the protocol (INT -4), subjects w ere not allow ed to have 
received fibrinolysis during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. This has been updated 
based on the standard of care for stroke patients.  
Inclusion Criterion # 2. 
An elevated D- dimer will now be required to be eligible if the VTE risk score is 2
or 3.  Direction to verify at randomization that the IMPROVE Risk Score 
calculated at screening was calculated correctly.
In Table 1, the footnote was simplified to mirror the cancer exclusion.
Inclusion Criterion # 4. 
Maximum daily dose of thromboproph ylactic agents allowed w as added to ensure 
that subjects have not received off -label use of thromboprophylaxis.   
Rationale: Modified exclusion criteria to align with standard of care and to provide more clarity for enrollment.
Section 4.2 Exclusion Criteria. Exclusion Criterion #1. The phrase about recent bleeding that w ould allow  the 
investigator to make a determination of whether or not the bleeding would 
contraindicate the use of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis w as rem oved.
Exclusion Criterion # 2. Guidance on differentiating major from minor surgery 
has been added. 
According to the standard of care, ongoing thromboprophylaxis is generally not 
discontinued for the performance of cataract surgery, so the notation that recent 
cataract surgery is not an exclusion criterion has been added.
The exclusion period for recent head trauma was reduced from 3 months to 
4weeks, based on expert input.
Exclusion Criterion #3. Reference was changed for consistency with the new 
location of the item referenced.
Exclusion Criterion #5. Addition of any intracranial bleeding.
Exclusion Criterion #6 was removed. 
Exclusion Criterion #7. For intracranial neoplasm, it was clarified that the 
presence of either a malignant or a benign neoplasm would result in exclusi on.
Exclusion Criterion #10. Subjects with cancer not in remission will be excluded.  
The previous requirement for a remission of at least 6 months duration has been 
removed, allowing the clinician to determine what time period is appropriate.

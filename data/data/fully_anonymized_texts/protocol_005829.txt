Disease Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a highly prevalent disorder of dementia in older adults. AD neuropathology is marked by [CONTACT_627101] (Khachaturian, 1985). Autopsy studies (Trojanowski et al., 1997), as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies (Jack et al., 1997; Convit et al., 1993; Killiany et al., 1993) in living persons, have established that the neurodegenerative changes in AD begin in medial temporal lobe structures and later progress to adjacent temporal, parietal and frontal neocortical regions (Braak & Braak, 1991; Price et al., 2001). Magnetic resonance image studies of AD consistently reveal volumetric loss in the hippocampus using both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches (Jack et al., 1997; Convit et al., 1993; Killiany et al., 1993). The primary symptom of early-stage AD is memory impairment (Mohs et al., 1998; Storandt et al., 2002) possibly accompanied by [CONTACT_627102] (Balota & Faust, 2001). Normal aging, however, is also marked by [CONTACT_405600] (Park et al., 2009; Park et al., 2014), as well as structural brain changes (Raz & Rodrigue, 2006). Autopsy data had shown in the past that about 30% of older adults with no obvious cognitive impairment show some degree of the neuropathology typi[INVESTIGATOR_627085] (Bennett et al., 2006; Kemper, 1994).  Importantly, the recent ability to image b-amyloid and tau deposits in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning has revolutionized our understanding of early stages of AD. Evidence suggests that amyloid deposits may be detected 10 - 15 years before memory symptoms appear. These findings are leading to the ability to diagnose AD years before symptoms begin (see Jack et al., 2013 for a review). Much less is known about the impact and developmental course of tau deposition because the ligand to image tau was only recently invented. There is increasing evidence that tau is particularly toxic to the brain and is a later precursor of AD than amyloid deposits. Additional research on b-amyloid and tau deposition in aging is crucial, as much work suggests that treatment of AD may be most effective when implemented early in the time course of the disease (Sperling et al., 2011). Understanding the impact of tau deposits and its interactions with amyloid deposition allows us to see the development of early markers of AD, which are important in understanding the trajectory of the disease. An important approach to understand the amyloid/tau puzzle and its relationship to AD is a large-scale longitudinal study of normal aging that integrates extensive neuroimaging and cognitive assessments along with tau imaging. A key aspect in separating normal from pathological aging is the inclusion of adults across the lifespan, establishing baselines from a sufficiently early stage to detect the very beginnings of pathological decline. The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS) began in 2008 and was designed to utilize the new in vivo imaging techniques to address uncertainty regarding how AD pathology relates

Study Agent Background and Associated Known Toxicities A PET/CT tau imaging agent, [18F]AV-1451, was developed by [CONTACT_176088], a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company. For this study, Avid and UT Southwestern have signed a clinical agreement that allows UTSW to produce this imaging agent, [18F]AV-1451, which is in Phase II clinical trials, and a focus of the present IND. It has been extensively evaluated by [CONTACT_627104], including human brain sections, and human PET/CT imaging, as well as in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease (Chien et al., 2013; Declercq et al., 2016; Schöll et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2013). It has been shown to have a high affinity for tau tangles. Based on studies in humans, it is estimated that the dose of radiation from [18F]AV-1451, averaged over the entire human body, is comparable to the range of other approved brain imaging agents, such as an agent [18F]FDG (1.0 rem) and [18F]florbetapir ([18F]AV-45) (1.3 rem) (see Appendix V). In completed studies with a total of [ADDRESS_835704] 1% of subjects and were not thought by [CONTACT_274432], or otherwise thought by [CONTACT_627105]: diarrhea, headache, muscle spam, dysgeusia, injection site pain (see Appendix V). In vitro autoradiography results showed that [18F]AV-1451 bound with high affinity to aggregated tau protein and with preferential selectivity for aggregated tau vs. β-amyloid positive sections (Xia et al., 2013). The Kd calculated for [18F]AV-1451 binding to aggregated tau protein in human brain slices was measured to be approximately 15 nM. In that study, the dissociation constant (Kd) could not be calculated for [18F]AV-1451 binding to PHF-tau purified from the human brain samples because at lower ligand concentrations (< 200 nM) autoradiographic signals were indistinguishable from noise, and at high concentrations binding was nonspecific and random. They also compared a competitive binding assay versus a panel of 72 common central nervous system targets, observing no clinically relevant inhibition for [18F]AV-1451. [18F]AV-1451 has demonstrated rapid uptake in vivo in mouse, rat, and monkey brains followed by [CONTACT_627106] (Appendix V; Declercq et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2013). Preclinical toxicity studies of [18F]AV-1451 showed a good safety profile with no observable effects at high multiples of the intended maximum human dose (Appendix V). With respect to risk for genotoxicity, positive results in the in vitro Ames test and chromosomal aberration studies did not manifest in the in vivo rat micronucleus study at doses greater than 750 times the intended human dose. [18F]AV-1451 was positive in the in vitro hERG assay. However, the cardiovascular assessments performed during the dog toxicology studies showed no evidence that [18F]AV-1451 prolongs the QT interval at high multiples of relevant clinical doses, and therefore risk of QT prolongation is not included in the risk profile. Out of an abundance of caution, and in consideration of previous

Human dosimetry has been obtained for nine participants (Appendix V). The radiotracer distribution was consistent among the participants and showed rapid hepatobiliary clearance. The organs of the gastrointestinal tract (upper large intestine, small intestine and liver) received the greatest exposure. The whole-body effective dose for a 10 mCi (370 MBq) injection of [18F]AV-1451 was calculated to be 8.92 mSv. This is comparable to the effective doses of approved 18F-labeled compounds such as [18F]florbetapir and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose.  The distribution of the imaging agent in the brain closely matches the expected pattern of deposits. Considering the well supported specificity of [18F]AV-[ADDRESS_835705]. Avid Radiopharmaceuticals has signed a clinical agreement allowing UT Southwestern to produce up to 125 doses of this tau imaging agent ([18F]AV-1451) for the current DLBS Wave 3.  6.4.3. Other Agents [IP_ADDRESS]. Florbetapir F 18 The inclusion of florbetapir F 18 allows us to get a complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_627086] – tau and amyloid – in healthy adults. Florbetapir F [ADDRESS_835706]. Better characterization of where and when amyloid accrues and its relationship to tau burden and cognitive changes will provide critical knowledge to help assess Alzheimer’s disease, treat patients, and develop therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. To meet this objective, all participants in the study will have undergone Florbetapir F [ADDRESS_835707] Tau PET scan under a UTSW IRB approved protocol.  [IP_ADDRESS]. Florbetapir F 18 mechanism of action Florbetapir F 18 is an FDA approved radiopharmaceutical compound containing the radionuclide fluorine-18 bound to the compound florbetapir, a molecule that binds with high affinity to beta amyloid plaque, a peptide that plays a key role in Alzheimer's Disease pathogenesis. The radionuclide fluorine-18 was chosen as it has a half-life of 110 minutes allowing it to accumulate sufficiently in the brain before undergoing positron emission decay. In in vitro binding studies using postmortem human brain homogenates containing

STU092015-003, Park, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_35, 04-20-22 (2).docx   Protocol Version: v6 14  β-amyloid plaques, the Kd for florbetapir F 18 was 3.7 ± 0.3 nM. The binding of florbetapir F 18 to β-amyloid aggregates was demonstrated in postmortem human brain sections using autoradiographic methods, thioflavin S and traditional silver staining correlation studies as well as monoclonal antibody β-amyloid-specific correlation studies. Florbetapir F 18 binding to tau protein and a battery of neuroreceptors was not detected in in vitro studies (Eli Lily 2012).  [IP_ADDRESS]. Florbetapir F [ADDRESS_835708] common reported adverse reaction was headache, occurring in 2% of patients, followed by [CONTACT_363602], blood pressure increased, fatigue, nausea, and injection site reaction, all occurring in < 1% of patients (Eli Lily 2012).  6.4.4. Rationale Tau pathology is a primary feature of Alzheimer’s disease, and can now be measured in vivo using the recently developed PET radiotracer [18F]AV-1451. Autopsy studies have long established that many older adults who exhibited no signs of cognitive impairment in life are found at autopsy to possess the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. In the previous decade, PET imaging tracers made it possible to image amyloid plaques but not tau tangles in the living brain, providing substantial insight into the cascade of events leading from a healthy to a diseased brain. However, these studies have also indicated that amyloid has a limited direct effect on the neurodegeneration and cognitive decline indicative of incipi[INVESTIGATOR_547350]. One prevailing theory, supported by [CONTACT_627107], is that amyloid induces tau tangle pathology, and it is tau that directly connects to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. The recent development of tau imaging ligands, including [18F]AV-1451, provides an opportunity to better understand the joint influence of tau and amyloid on neurodegeneration and cognition, as well as insight into the neurological cascade from health to dementia of the Alzheimer’s type. An understanding of this cascade is critical for therapeutic and intervention trials.  The main objective of the present project is to assess evidence for neurofibrillary tau pathology in the brains of adults who are participants in Wave [ADDRESS_835709] — the DLBS. This is a longitudinal observational study and tau imaging will be open-label. The DLBS protocol includes structural MRI, diffusion tensor, functional MRI, and a comprehensive cognitive and psychosocial battery as well as amyloid PET imaging. The DLBS participants (current age range: 38 - 96) allows us to address directly the role of tau deposition in declining cognition in a sample that was cognitively normal at the start of the

This population of subjects is critical to study because pathology for Alzheimer’s disease starts long before clinically observable effects develop. The timing of tau development relative to amyloid is not well understood. The Wave [ADDRESS_835710] 3 to present cognitive function and magnitude of decline over 8 - 10 years. While [18F]AV-[ADDRESS_835711] 60 [18F]AV-[ADDRESS_835712] 3 (the focus of the present protocol), we propose to manufacture [18F]AV-[ADDRESS_835713] 3. This portion of the study is important because it will allow us to assess longitudinal changes in [18F]AV-[ADDRESS_835714] 2 participants, and its relationship to growth in amyloid and decline in cognition. Secondly, we can see whether it increases more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_4782] a function of age. Finally, it will allow us to add to the information on [18F]AV-1451’s safety profile. These data, in combination with DLBS behavioral data and MRI scanning and amyloid imaging, will provide a comprehensive pi[INVESTIGATOR_627087] a period of years, allowing us a window into maintenance of cognitive health and, for some subjects, transition towards dementia.  Key neurological endpoints for this study include estimation of amyloid and tau deposition in participants at Wave 3. Tau deposition will be examined via estimating the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) of [18F]AV-1451 in temporal regions (both left and right) of interest: (1) inferior temporal gyrus, (2) middle temporal gyrus, (3) superior temporal gyrus, (4) entorhinal cortex, (5) parahippocampal gyrus, and (6) fusiform gyrus. SUVr of [18F]AV-1451 in these regions is elevated in those with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease (Johnson et al., 2016; Scholl et al., 2016). There are sometimes hemispheric-specific effects, so left and right hemispheres will be analyzed separately. We also note that Wave 3 amyloid deposition will be measured across eight cortical regions: dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, lateral temporal cortex, and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_627088].  Key cognitive endpoints for this study include measures of processing speed, epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], working memory, and executive function. Processing speed tasks measure participants’ ability to quickly do simple mental tasks, such as comparing two strings of numbers. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_627089], such as remembering the details of a story. Working memory tasks measure their ability to store and manipulate long strings of information in memory; a common task has participants repeating a list of numbers back to the experimenter in reverse order (n-

A wide range of research has shown that these cognitive functions typi[INVESTIGATOR_627090], particularly memory (Amieva et al., 2005; Epelbaum et al., 2017; Mortamais et al., 2017). The current study is one of the first to be able to examine how in vivo measures of tau deposition relate with declines in these cognitive functions.  6.5. STUDY OBJECTIVES  6.5.1. Primary Objectives [IP_ADDRESS]. To determine the time course of tau deposition with age and assess its relationship to changes in cognitive function over a 10-year interval by [CONTACT_627108] 125 adults from previous waves of the DLBS using the tau tracer [18F]AV-1451. 6.5.2. Secondary Objectives [IP_ADDRESS]. To assess the relationship of tau burden to hippocampal volume and cortical thickness and their contributions to predicting decline in memory and other cognitive functions. [IP_ADDRESS]. To determine whether rate of amyloid accumulation over the past 8 - 10-year interval predicts tau deposition.  [IP_ADDRESS]. To examine the detrimental effect of tau deposits, as well as the joint effect of tau and amyloid, on changes in brain activity and cognitive function.  [IP_ADDRESS]. To examine differences in cognitive, structural, and functional decline between those with and without amyloid and tau pathology. 6.5.3. Exploratory Objectives [IP_ADDRESS]. As findings are made while pursuing these secondary objectives, we will sometimes conduct additional follow-up analyses to better understand these findings. For example, a sufficient number of subjects vary in their socioeconomic status (SES), we will likely examine if SES is related to the time course of tau deposition. 6.5.4. Primary Endpoints 
  University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center IND# 143884    [18F]AV-1451 November 2021  
STU092015-003, Park, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_35, 04-20-22 (2).docx   Protocol Version: v6 17  [IP_ADDRESS]. The primary objective will involve completion of up to 125 [18F]AV-[ADDRESS_835715] 1 and 2  DLBS participants. Once these data are collected, data collection will stop. 6.5.5. Secondary Endpoints Tau deposition will be examined via estimating the SUVr of [18F]AV-1451 in temporal regions (both left and right) of interest: (1) inferior temporal gyrus, (2) middle temporal gyrus, (3) superior temporal gyrus, (4) entorhinal cortex, (5) parahippocampal gyrus, and (6) fusiform gyrus. Amyloid accumulation will be measured continuously as the SUVr value averaged across eight cortical regions: dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, lateral temporal cortex, and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_52030].  [IP_ADDRESS]. Hippocampal volume and regional cortical thickness will be estimated using FreeSurfer (ver. 5.3), with surface parcellation manually edited, when necessary, by [CONTACT_627109].  [IP_ADDRESS]. Longitudinal declines in brain structures will be measured using linear mixed models with estimated cortical thickness and white matter volumes from waves 1, 2, and 3 as our primary structural measures, BOLD signal from a subsequent memory task, a semantic judgment task, and resting state as our functional measures, and time of scanning entered as an interaction term.  [IP_ADDRESS]. Joint effects of tau and amyloid will be examined by [CONTACT_627110] a linear mixed-model analysis. [IP_ADDRESS]. Cognitive decline will be assessed using the following constructs: processing speed, epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], working memory, and executive function. Scores on these constructs will be averaged across relevant DLBS tasks and standardized based on performance at the beginning of this longitudinal study (Wave 1).   6.6.

Assessments performed for clinical indications (not exclusively to determine study eligibility) may be used for baseline values even if the studies were done before written informed consent was obtained. All screening procedures will be performed within 30 days prior to registration unless otherwise stated. For participants who will complete their scan over 30 days since their screening date—most often, this is due to having to reschedule their initial appointment—we will confirm whether their medications, medical history (e.g., surgeries), and allergies have changed since their initial screening. Any such changes will be documented, and changes that may affect their eligibility to participate in this study will be submitted to the physician to confirm whether they are still eligible to participate. The screening procedures include: 6.7.2.

Contraindications There are no known contraindications to the usage of flortaucipir F 18 ([18F]AV-1451). Pregnant or lactating females have been excluded from all [18F]AV-1451studies due to the potential risks of radiation to the fetus. Non-radioactive flortaucipir was positive in the in vitro hERG assay with an IC50 of 0.610 μM. If the flortaucipir hERG channel IC50 is converted to a ng/mL concentration (161 ng/mL), and compared to the maximum theoretical flortaucipir peak plasma concentration in a subject given a 20 μg dose (3.8 ng/mL), the safety margin is at least 42-fold. The safety margin increases to over 900-fold when accounting for plasma protein binding in the calculation (plasma protein unbound fraction, fu-human = 0.047). Additionally, in vitro cardiovascular assessments in dogs showed no evidence of QT prolongation. Nonetheless, until sufficient human cardiovascular safety data are available, clinical studies will exclude subjects with a history of risk factors for torsade de pointes and subjects taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. [IP_ADDRESS]. Special Warnings and Precautions for Use To ensure study integrity and to reduce any risk to participants, study personnel will closely monitor: (1) the participant’s study experience, (2) the actual vs. target study accrual rates, (3) participant attrition (e.g. withdrawals, dropouts), (4) patterns of adverse events (AEs) and unanticipated events, (5) patterns of protocol deviations/violations, (6) study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_627093] (7) changes in risk/benefit. Findings from the tau scan and all other research results will not be shared with the participants as explicitly noted in the consent form. Participants will be screened by a physician remotely before scheduling the scan and screened by a physician in person before leaving the scanning area. Researchers

Potential risks and discomforts will be prevented and/or minimized to the greatest extent possible by [CONTACT_627112], monitoring, withdrawal of the subject upon evidence of difficulty or adverse event; referral for treatment, counseling, or other necessary follow-up. The study records will be treated as private to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. Reassurance will be provided as needed and participants will be reminded that their continued participation in the study is completely voluntary.  [IP_ADDRESS]. Interaction with other medications Comprehensive drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed in subjects to delineate the effect that other medications may have on the distribution of [18F]AV-1451.   Please refer to the investigator brochure, Appendix V, for detail on the preclinical in vitro results of non-radiolabeled AV-1451 to human liver microsomes and MDCK-MDR1 cells. This testing did not yield evidence for inhibition of CYP enzymes or P-glycoprotein transport at concentrations greatly exceeding expected plasma concentrations at recommended human dosing for imaging (maximum 20 µg [18F]AV-1451).  Because of the positive in-vitro hERG assay, albeit correlating to concentrations of [18F]AV-1451 expected to far exceed that encountered at imaging doses (~42-900 fold safety margin), subjects with prolonged QTc interval, risk factors for prolonged QTc, or taking drugs known to prolong QT interval will be excluded. [IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Reactions 
 All reported events were mild or moderate in severity, and all subjects recovered. 
 Risks of adverse reactions associated with [18F]AV-1451 administration: In completed studies with a total of [ADDRESS_835727] 1% of subjects and were not thought by [CONTACT_093](s) to be related to study procedures, or otherwise thought by [CONTACT_093](s) to be related to [18F]AV-1451: diarrhea, headache, muscle spasm, dysgeusia, injection site pain [IP_ADDRESS].2.1. Risks and discomforts associated with the PET/CT scan procedures:

[IP_ADDRESS].2.2. Risks of radiation exposure (including [18F]AV-[ADDRESS_835728] scan): [18F]AV- [ADDRESS_835729]’s long-term cumulative radiation exposure, which is associated with an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_50876]. Additionally, higher levels of radiation can cause damage to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. • The amount of radiation exposure is similar to other 18F radiopharmaceuticals. • Females of childbearing potential will usually be excluded from [18F]AV-1451 studies unless they are surgically sterile, agree to use reliable contraception, or refrain from sexual activity. • Females of childbearing potential who do participate must not be pregnant or breastfeeding at screening (negative serum β-HCG at screening and a negative urine β-HCG within 24 hours prior to injection), and must agree to avoid becoming pregnant. • Female and male study subjects must agree to refrain from sexual activity or to use reliable contraceptive methods for 90 days following administration of [18F]AV-1451 injection. [IP_ADDRESS].2.3. The risk of harm to the subjects from radiation for this study can be compared to risks from everyday activities. For example, the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_627094]’s lifetime from this radiation exposure is comparative to the risk of suffering a fatal car crash while driving 918 miles in an automobile. PET/CT Scan - Placement of the IV catheter for isotope injection may result in pain, infection, or bruising at the site. Placement of an IV catheter may cause anxiety. Psychological Stress – Participants could experience uneasiness from questions being asked or knowing that personnel have their personal information.  Loss of Confidentiality – There is a risk for loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep information confidential; however, this can never be guaranteed.

STU092015-003, Park, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_35, 04-20-22 (2).docx   Protocol Version: v6 28  Other Risks - There is a very low risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_627095]’s lifetime from this radiation. There may possibly be other side effects that are unknown at this time.  6.8.2. Adverse Event Monitoring Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial. Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring of subject safety and care.  All subjects experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study therapy, will be monitored until:  • the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse event return to baseline or is stable in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871](s);  • there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study therapy for the changes observed;  • or death. [IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions  An adverse event is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human research study participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam, imaging finding or clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, clinical event, or disease, temporarily associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not it is considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  Adverse events encompass clinical, physical and psychological harms. Adverse events occur most commonly in the context of biomedical research, although on occasion, they can occur in the context of social and behavioral research. Adverse events may be expected or unexpected. Acute Adverse Events  Adverse events occurring in the time period from the signing of the informed consent, through [ADDRESS_835730] treatment will be considered acute adverse events.   Severity  Adverse events will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0. Adverse

Grade 1: Mild  Grade 2: Moderate Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening Grade 4: Life threatening consequences Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event Serious Adverse Events  ICH Guideline E2A and the UTSW IRB define serious adverse events as those events, occurring at any dose, which meets any of the following criteria:  • Results in death   • Immediately life-threatening  • Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]1,2 or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  • Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  • Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition. Note: A “Serious adverse event” is by [CONTACT_572506]. Serious adverse events may or may not be related to the research project. A serious adverse event determination does not require the event to be related to the research. That is, both events completely unrelated to the condition under study and events that are expected in the context of the condition under study may be serious adverse events, independent of relatedness to the study itself. As examples, a car accident requiring > 24 hour inpatient admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263996] a serious adverse event for any research participant; likewise, in a study investigating end-stage cancer care, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263997]-specified period of monitoring for adverse and serious adverse events would be a serious adverse event, even if the event observed is a primary clinical endpoint of the study. 1Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114579]. Note: If events occur during a pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64329], that prolong the existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], those events should be evaluated and/or reported as SAEs.   2NCI defines hospi[INVESTIGATOR_627096] 24 hours.

Furthermore, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572462] a routine AE or in an expedited report. [IP_ADDRESS]. Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]): The phrase “unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others” is found, but not defined in the HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46, and the FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56.108(b)(1) and [ADDRESS_835731], which is defined in 21 CFR 812.3(s). Guidance from the regulatory agencies considers unanticipated problems to include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets ALL three (3) of the following criteria: • Unexpected in terms of nature, severity or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;        AND • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]);       AND  • Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. Note: According to OHRP, if the adverse event is serious, it would always suggest a greater risk of harm. Follow-up  All adverse events will be followed up according to good medical practices.  6.8.3.  Steps to Determine If a Serious Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting to the HRPP Step 1: Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5).  Step 2: Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v5.

STU092015-003, Park, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_35, 04-20-22 (2).docx   Protocol Version: v6 31  Step 3: Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy.  Attribution categories are as follows: • Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment. • Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. • Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment. • Unlikely – The AE may NOT be related to the study treatment. • Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment. Note: This includes all events that occur to the end of the acute adverse events reporting period as defined in section 6.8.2 Step 4: Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the treatment. An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in: • the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section of this protocol (if applicable) • the drug package insert (if applicable) • the current Investigator’s Brochure (if applicable) • the Study Agent(s)/Therapy(ies) Background and Associated Known Toxicities section of this protocol [IP_ADDRESS].

Classification: Positron Emitting Radiopharmaceutical [IP_ADDRESS]. Mode of Action: Flortaucipir F 18 is under investigation as a diagnostic PET radiopharmaceutical for in vitro imaging of tau pathology in patients with AD and related neurodegenerative diseases characterized by [CONTACT_627115]. The primary pharmacodynamic data obtained on flortaucipir F 18 show a high selectivity for binding to tau protein aggregates vs. β-amyloid in human brain tissue and rapid uptake in the brain with clearance from normal tissue in mice, rats and non-human primates. These data indicate that flortaucipir F 18 is potentially an important new tool for the in vitro assessment of tau protein aggregates (e.g. neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)), thus providing a possible biomarker of the progressive pathology underlying neurodegeneration in AD. Such an agent may prove useful in the diagnosis, follow-up and therapeutic monitoring of AD and other dementias. [IP_ADDRESS]. Storage and Stability: [18F]AV-1451 for Injection is stored at room temperature. [18F]AV-1451 for Injection should be stored within the original container or equivalent radiation shielding.   [IP_ADDRESS]. Protocol Dose: [18F]AV-1451 for Injection will be administered IV up to a radioactive target dose of 370 MBq with a maximum human mass dose (MHD) limited to 20 µg of compound by [CONTACT_8497]. This dose is 150 fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat single dose toxicity study and is 50 fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat and dog repeat dose toxicity studies. Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects. The results estimated an Effective Dose of 8.92 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to the effective dose of approved 18F-labeled compounds such as [18F]FDG and florbetapir F [ADDRESS_835732] acceptable image quality in preliminary human studies.

Incompatibilities: There are no known absolute contraindications to [18F]AV-1451. The effects of [18F]AV-[ADDRESS_835735] not been studied in pregnant or lactating females and subjects that are either pregnant or lactating will be excluded from the study. Severe drug allergies may pose a potential safety risk. Subjects will be screened by a physician for relevant drug allergy history and will excluded at the discretion of the screening physician.   Preclinical in vitro testing of non-radiolabeled AV-1451 showed a positive potassium ion channel assay as detailed in the investigator brochure. The theoretical peak plasma concentration of [18F]AV-1451 following the maximum recommended dose of 20 µg [18F]AV-[ADDRESS_835736]. This safety margin is likely vastly underestimated when plasma protein binding is also accounted for ~900 fold safety margin. However, given the relatively limited safety data available to date in humans, subjects with documented prolonged QTc interval on screening EKG, those with historical risk factors for QT prolongation, and subjects taking medications known to cause QT prolongation (determined at physician screening) will be excluded.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 6.10.1. Study Design/Study Endpoints This is a single-center study that uses two types of designs. First, the Wave 3 data will be analyzed separately and utilizes a cross-sectional design with age as a primary continuous variable, as well as multiple aspects of brain structure, brain function, cognitive performance, and amyloid deposition used as additional predictors of different types of

Then, in a second series of analyses that integrate data from Wave 1, Wave 2, and Wave 3, a retrospective-longitudinal design will be used to assess the relationship of present tau deposition to change in multiple aspects of brain structure, brain function, cognitive performance, and amyloid across time. Tau imaging agent administration is open-label, and imaging of participants will end when all eligible participants are scanned, all remaining participants have been contact[CONTACT_627118], or in the event that new safety data becomes available that indicates the study should be terminated. Study endpoints described in sections 6.5.4 and 6.5.5 are repeated below. [IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Endpoints The primary objective will involve completion of up to 125 [18F]AV-[ADDRESS_835741] been collected in previous visits. Once the tau scan data are collected, data collection will stop. [IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Endpoints Tau deposition will be estimated from Wave 3 data by [CONTACT_627119] [18F]AV-1451 in temporal regions (both left and right) of interest: (1) inferior temporal gyrus, (2) middle temporal gyrus, (3) superior temporal gyrus, (4) entorhinal cortex, (5) parahippocampal gyrus, and (6) fusiform gyrus. Amyloid accumulation will be measured as the SUVr value averaged across eight cortical regions: dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, lateral temporal cortex, and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_52030]. Both measures of tau and amyloid will be used as continuous measures rather than positive and negative dichotomy. In addition, there were [ADDRESS_835742] 1 to 3, and then retrospectively relate tau levels to changes in these endpoints.  
 Hippocampal volume and regional cortical thickness will be estimated using FreeSurfer (ver. 5.3), with surface parcellation manually edited, when necessary, by [CONTACT_627109].  
 Estimates of white matter integrity will be collected using diffusion tensor measures. For functional measures, BOLD signal from contrasts of interest using selected ROI’s will be created using our

In addition, we will also use resting state data to look at how tau effects functional brain connectivity.  
 Joint effects of tau and amyloid will be examined by [CONTACT_627110] a linear mixed-model analysis. 
 Cognitive decline will be assessed using the following constructs: processing speed, epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], working memory, and executive function. Scores on these constructs will be averaged across relevant DLBS tasks and standardized based on performance at the beginning of this longitudinal study (Wave 1).  6.10.2. Sample Size and Accrual To fulfill the primary objective of this research project, we intend to conduct tau PET imaging with up to [ADDRESS_835743] of data collection.  Statistical power was computed using G*Power (ver 3.1) assuming successful collection of tau data for the full 125 subjects and using default G*Power parameters unless otherwise specified. The secondary objectives of this study (Sections [IP_ADDRESS] - [IP_ADDRESS]) are assumed to involve linear relationships between variables for the purpose of this power analysis. With this sample size, we have an estimated power of 0.[ADDRESS_835744] linear relationships that are medium-sized (effect size: r = 0.30). This robust power level will allow for strong confidence in our findings, computation of more precise 95% confidence intervals on effect sizes, and more fine-grained post hoc analysis.     6.10.3. Data Analyses For all analyses, testing the primary and secondary objectives of this study, our measures of interest will be measured continuously and entered into linear regression or linear mixed-models analyses as appropriate. For each objective, as we have noted earlier, we will first analyze the data cross-sectionally within Wave [ADDRESS_835745] hoc analyses will be corrected for family-wise error using the multi-stage Holm-Bonferroni method (Holm, 1979). Then we will model changes from Waves [ADDRESS_835746] 3.

STU092015-003, Park, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_35, 04-20-22 (2).docx   Protocol Version: v6 38  [IP_ADDRESS]. Our primary objective, to determine the time course of tau deposition with age, will be first assessed by [CONTACT_62252] a linear regression between the AV-[ADDRESS_835747] that tau accumulation will accelerate in old age, thus supporting a non-linear rate of deposition. [IP_ADDRESS]. A linear mixed-model analysis will be used to relate our continuous SUVr measure of amyloid deposition with the SUVr for tau deposition in each of our temporal ROIs. An amyloid SUVr x time of testing interaction term will be used to predict changes in tau SUVr. We predict that increased amyloid burden will be associated with accelerated tau deposition.    [IP_ADDRESS]. To determine differences in cognitive, structural, and functional decline between those with and without tau and amyloid pathology, we will perform multiple linear mixed-model analyses. All variables of interest will be included as continuous measures. Tau SUVr x time and amyloid SUVr x time interaction terms will be entered in these models to predict how amyloid and tau pathology predicts longitudinal changes in our cognitive, structural, and functional measure of interest. In line with recent research, we predict tau burden in particular to be strongly associated with more rapid structural and cognitive decline.   [IP_ADDRESS]. Similar to section [IP_ADDRESS], relationships between estimated tau deposition (SUVr) with hippocampal volume and cortical thickness will be estimated by [CONTACT_627120]-model analyses with interaction terms including time of scanning/testing. We hypothesize that elevated tau SUVr will be associated with more steep declines in hippocampal volume and cortical thickness. [IP_ADDRESS]. To examine the joint effect of tau and amyloid, these variables will be multiplied to form an interaction term (tau SUVr x amyloid SUVr x time) that will be entered in a linear mixed-model analysis to predict longitudinal changes in cognitive, structural, and functional measures.  6.11.

STU092015-003, Park, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_35, 04-20-22 (2).docx   Protocol Version: v6 39  Any investigator(s) who has a conflict of interest with this study (patent ownership, royalties, or financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by [CONTACT_1385], etc.) must have the conflict reviewed by [CONTACT_539621].  All investigators will follow the University conflict of interest policy. 6.11.2. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally mandated regulations. The IRB must approve the consent form and protocol. In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator(s) should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the subject will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_44316]. Once this essential information has been provided to the subject and the investigator(s) is assured that the subject understands the implications of participating in the study, the subject will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_10001]-approved consent form. Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_233791]. 6.11.3. Registration/Randomization Procedures Each newly consented subject will be numbered based on their assigned Dallas Lifespan Brain Study Number.  This number is unique to each subject and independent of all personal identifying information. This study does not require randomization; all participants will receive [18F]AV-1451. 6.11.4. Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing [IP_ADDRESS]. Regulatory Documentation  The following regulatory documents will be retained. • A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed consent. • IRB Federal-wide Assurance letter.

[IP_ADDRESS]. CRFs and Source data Case report forms (CRFs) will be used for this trial.  Individual patient files should include appropriate source documents, including but not limited to patient’s medical records and laboratory test results.  The files should include information such as visit dates, records of medical history, examinations administered, laboratory, concomitant treatment, any adverse event encountered and other notes as appropriate. These constitute “source data”.  All entries on the CRFs must be backed up by [CONTACT_112099]. Original electronic versions of imaging studies are also considered source data and will be kept on file by [CONTACT_779]/imaging center. Each patient’s source file should include an original signed informed consent form. When the trial is completed, the informed consent form should be kept on file with other trial related records. All original laboratory reports must be available for review in each patient’s file. It is important that the original reports be available for review because of the possibility of inaccuracies or errors in transcribing data from original records to the CRF. The CRFs must be kept in order and up-to-date so that they always reflect the latest observations on the subjects that are enrolled in the trial.  The CRFs must be completed for each patient enrolled in the trial. This should be done as soon as possible after completion of the patient’s participation in the trial.  A monitor will verify the source data for all information on the CRF. 6.11.5. Monitoring Trial monitoring will be conducted no less than annually and refers to a regular interval review of trial related activity and documentation performed by [CONTACT_295120]. This review includes but is not limited to accuracy of case report forms, protocol compliance, and AE/SAE management and reporting.

1.3. Purpose   
The purpose of this study is:  
• To evaluate the benefit of using intravenous fluorescein sodium  (FS) and YELLOW 560 nm 
microscope filter (YE560) during surgery for vestibular schwannomas (VS)  menigioma, head and 
neck paraganglioma (HNP) , or head and neck schwannoma  (HNS)  
• To determine the optimum FS dose and timing to be used with the YE560 device  
VSs are benign, slow -growing neoplasms of the myelin- containing Schwann cells of the vestibular 
division of the vestibulocochlear nerve. These tumors are in close proximity to the  facial nerve and 
cochlear division of the vestibulocochlear nerve. These nerves allow for facial movement and hearing, 
respectively. Management of these indolent tumors has shifted to more conservative means of minimizing growth and maintaining facial function and hearing. Management of VS s include s 
observation with serial MRI exams, stereotactic radiosurgery, and microsurgery.  
Similarly, HNP , HNS and skull base meningiomas are benign but infiltrative tumors that grow adjacent to 
important neurovascular st ructures including, the cranial nerves. These tumors can be observed, treated 
with radiosurgery, or microsurgery based on size, symptoms, and patient preference.  
When microsurgical resection of VS, schwannomas,  meningiomas, or paragangliomas  is performed, 
distinguishing the tumor from healthy nerve tissue is performed via direct visualization under light 
microscopy and tissue manipulation. Often, the se tumors are intimately associated with the surrounding 
nerves , and can be difficult to distinguish under the microscope. In many cases i ntraoperative cranial 
nerve monitoring allow for the use of a stimulation probe to help make this distinction.    
The hypothesis is that FS and YE560 may be used as a supplementary v isualization aid to better 
distinguish the tumor from healthy nerve tissue and secondarily improve conservation of facial and 
hearing nerve function and attainment of gross total resection (GTR).  Use of intravenous FS has FDA 
approval for ophthalmologic applications and its safety profile is well documented  (Yanuzzi 1986) . There 
have been studies demonstrating uptake of FS by [CONTACT_751622] (Perez 2018). Additionally, the 
feasibility and utility of intraoperative fluorescence from FS intravenous adminis tration  and use of YE560 
have  been demonstrated with peripheral schwannomas in vivo (Pedro 2019). The YE560 fluorescence 
module available for the KINEVO  900 will be used to visualize fluorescein -stained tissue in yellow light.  
FS will be administered upon initial visualization of the VS. Utility of FS and YE560 will be assessed via 
surgeon survey, correlation with biopsy of fluorescent VS tissue, and color image analysis of healthy and 
VS tissue using the YE560.  
A total of  90 consenting patients, either mal e or female, clinically indicated for resection of a suspected 
VS will be enrolled into the study. No exclusions will be made for recurrent VS following stereotactic 
radiosurgery or microsurgical resection or VS associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF -2).

3. Overview of the clinical Investigation   
3.1. Objectives   
Primary objective of this initial feasibility study is to evaluate the benefit of using YE560  to visualize 
fluorescein sodium  (FS) during surgery of VS, Meningioma, HNP, or HNS, determined from surgeon 
assessment.   
Secondary objectives are:  
• To evaluate the optimum FS dose and timing to be used with the YE560 device as determined by 
[CONTACT_751625]  
• Quantify tissue differentiation of fluorescent VS and adjacent nerves using RGB image analysis 
• To report clinical outcomes, including GTR rates, postoperative hearing outcomes, and postoperative 
facial nerve function   
 
3.2. Literature Review and Rationale   
In VS cases where intervention is recommended, stereotactic radiosurgery and microsurgical resection 
offer two therapeutic op tions. Comparatively, microsurgical resection carries the advantage of offering 
the highest chance of a cure .The goal of surgery remains to resect the tumor while maintaining the  
integrity of the  adjacent, and sometimes intimately adherent cochlear and facial nerves. Thus, gross 
total resection cannot always be achieved.  Nakatomi and colleagues described the superior 15 -year 
recurrence -free survival rates  in patients receiving gross total resection (56%) versus subtotal resection 
(8%).[ADDRESS_1028932] reported in vitro preferential uptake of FS in VS cells compared to native Schwann 
cells.6  Additiona lly, Pedro et al demonstrated feasibility of YE560 and intravenous FS in visualizing 
benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors —an identical histological entity  to VS —located in the 
extremities.7 In our  proposed  study, the fluorescence light will be visualized with a surgical microscope 
(Kinevo 900 ) with Y E560 fluorescence module. The device has optimized filter and optics; therefore, the 
concentration of fluorescein sodium per patient used in this study is expected to be lower than in earlier 
studies  that do not use the fluorescence module.  
Intraoperative fluorescence imaging has been utilized in the resection of HNP and meningiomas. 
Indocyaningreen fluorescence angiography has been used to assess post -embolization vascularity of 
paraganglioma to est imate bleeding risk.[ADDRESS_1028933]  dose for retinal imaging in adults is a 
500 mg b olus into a peripheral vein (7.1 mg/kg in a 70 kg patient) .[ADDRESS_1028934] 
reported , but 87% of sur veyed ophthalmologists report ed rates less than 5%. Urticaria is estimated to 
occur at a rate of 1 in 82 patients. Severe adverse reactions, including res pi[INVESTIGATOR_560088] (1:3,800), 
cardiac events (1:5300), and tonic -clonic  seizure  (1:13.900)  are rare and estimated to occur  cumulati vely 
in 1 in 1900 pa tients .11

3.4. Hypothesis   
12. Given prior evidence of preferential uptake of FS in VS and meningiomas due to disrupted blood 
brain barrier, we hypothesize that use of intravenous FS will allow for visual differentiation of tumor  and surrounding structures and nerves using YE560.  
13. The o ptimal dosing for FS has not been established for this application. Pedro et al utilized 0.5 -
1.0 mg/kg body weight to visualize peripheral nerve sheath tumors with YE560.  The authors 
found saturation of all tissues with 3 -4 mg/kg dose within 18 seconds of administration. The 
blood -brain barrier may play a modulating role. Schebesch et al (2013) used 3 -4 mg/kg to 
visualize malignant gliomas and observed fluorescence after [ADDRESS_1028936] that the 
optimal dose will be 3 -4 mg/kg, and peak fluorescenc e will take a similar amount of time. 
However, w e will initially utilize 1.0 mg/kg SF administered at the time of first visualizing the 
tumor to enable subsequent doses  (up to a maximum of 500 mg  or 7 mg/kg ). This will allow us 
to determine the minimum eff ective dose and observe the time to peak fluorescence. The 
optimal dosing strategy will be finalized after the first 10 cases . 
14. We hypothesize that the surgeons will be satisfied with the use of SF and YE560, as reflected in 
responses on the Surgeon Survey.  Specifically, we hypothesize that greater than 75% of 
surgeons would choose to use SF and YE560 at least in the majority of future VS , meni goma, 
HNP, or HNS resections based on responses from the Surgeon Survey.  Secondarily, we 
hypothesize that surgeons will rate the correlation of fluorescence with visual assessment with white light microscopy and electrostimulation to be “good” or “excellent” for over 75% of the cases. 
15.  Because the yellow fluorescence is primarily comprised of red and green components, we 
hypothesize that RGB component analysis of intraoperative images will yield significantly higher red and green values in the VS compared to the facial and cochlear nerves.  Similar analysis may 
be conducted between the tumor and surround nerves or structures of interest for  meningiomas, HNP, and HNS.  
   
3.5. Design and Proposed Analysis   
16. The feasibility study will involve 90  patients, focusing on intra- operative visualization of 
fluorescein using YE560  in VS, meni gioma, HNP , or HNS,  inclusive of recurrent tumors, 
previously radiated tumors, and patients with neurofibromatosis type 2. There will be an 
allowance to enroll up to 95  patients to meet the goal of 90 subjects if subjects are withdrawn 
from the study due to a different pathologic entity diagnosed on biopsy of the tumor. 
Establishing the optimal dose and timing for FS will be a part of the feasibility study.  Flexibility 
will be allowed with the dose and timing to achieve optimal visualization condition based on 
surgeon feedbac k with a maximum cumulative dose of 500 mg ( standard dosage for 
ophthalmology angiography ). The study will be largely descriptive , documenting the 
macroscopic appearance of FS and describing surgeon observations with regards to timing of 
peak fluorescence, correlation with electrostimulation, and utility in differentiating normal 
tissue from tumor .  
17. Images  containing the tumor and facial and cochlear nerves  (or other relevant s tructures of 
interest in the case of meningioma, HNP, or HNS) will be captured with the microscope with the 
YE560 filter by [CONTACT_751627]; the YE560 filter will then be turned off and another identical image will be captured under white light microscopy for the separate survey validation 
analysis . For the RGB component image analysis, t he fluorescence  of the tumor will be 
measured in comparison to the facial nerve and cochlear nerve using ImageJ image analysis 
software to quantify the red, green,  and blue components of the images.  Inferential statistics 
will be used to compare the red, green, and blue components of regions of interest from the VS 
and the adjacent facial or cochlear nerve.  
18. For the survey validation analysis, we will validate the qu estion “How well did fluorescence 
correlate with your visual assessment of the tumor and nerve tissue under normal microscopy without the Yellow 560 filter?” The neurosurgeons and neurotologists will be presented with 30-
60 second videos  of the VS and faci al and/ or cochlear nerves, with and without  YE560 active . 
The surgeons will respond to the above question with choices of “no correlation,” “some 
correlation,” “good correlation,” and “excellent correlation.” Other questions from the surgeon 
survey will no t be validated due to  the scope of the feasibility study.  
3.6. Methodology   
3.6.1.  Investigational Type   
19. The current investigation is a feasibility study, to assess the usability of the YE560 option 
for visualization of FS during VS resection.  
20. 3.6.2.  Patients  
21. A total of 90 consenting patients, either male or female, clinically indicated for surgical resection 
of suspected VS, meni ngioma, HNP, HNS or recurrent VS, menigioma, HNP, or HNS will be part of 
the feasibility study phase.  Patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 and those receiving prior 
radiation therapy will not be excluded from the study.  
3.6.3.  Timeframe   
22. The estimated timeframe for enrol lment is approximately 18 months (from January  2019  – June  
2021).  
3.6.4.  Recruitment Process   
23. Patients under the care of the Clinical Investigators who are clinically indicated for surgical resection as a suspected VS , meni ngioma, or head and neck paraganglioma  or recurrent VS, 
meni ngioma, HNP, or HNS will be considered eligible for participation in the study. Each 
potential participant will be assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Potential 
patients shall be provided with plain language information about the study and will have the 
opportunity to ask questions of the study investigators. Informed consent shall be obtained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -Investigators from eligible patients wishing to participate. Any 
patient that chooses not to p articipate in the study will undergo their indicated surgery with 
standard techniques, and their health care will not be compromised in any way. Patients shall be free to withdraw from the study at any time.  
3.6.5.  Inclusion Criteria   
Inclusion criteria shall be:  
• Patient with a s uspected VS , meni gioma, HNP or HNS  
• Recurrent VS , meni gioma, HNP, or HNS  with prior microsurgical  resection or radiation therapy 
• Clinical indication for microsurgical resection  
 
3.6.6.  Exclusion Criteria   
Exclusion criteria shall be:  
• Children (patients less than 18 years of age)  
• History of allergy to FS  
• History of renal failure  
• Pregnant women  
• Those with inability to give informed consent  
• Prisoners and inmates  
 
3.6.7.  Point of Enrollment   
Potential subjects will be provided with plain language information about the research  on the informed 
consent form , prior to signing the  consent form indicating their willingness to participate. The point of 
enro llment shall be upon clinical evaluation and consent for surgery . The patient shall be considered as 
part of the study population once they have undergone the YE560 visuali zation during the indicated 
microsurgery with confirmatory histopathology . Patients will be withdrawn from the study population if 
their final histopathology is not consis tent with vestibular schwannoma; this is expected to occur in less 
than 5% of subjects. Clinical data, intraoperative images, survey results and postoperative clinical data 
will still be maintained for these patients for potential case presentation or evaluation of bias.  
 
3.6.8.  Primary Endpoint   
Primary endpoint of this study will be an assessment of the utility of FS and YE560 via  survey of the 
operating surgeons.  
24. The primary outcome will be response to the question “ Based on the use and performance of FS 
in this case alone, how likely are you to use  FS in future cases (excluding the research trial)  
involving this tumor ?” We hypothesize that > 75% of responses will be “Plan to use in the 
majority of cases” or “Plan to use in all cases.”  
25. This primary outcome will be supported by [CONTACT_751628] -style ratings.  The 
responses to the latter correlation will be validated via presentation of fluorescence and white 
light microscopy images to the surgeons.  
 
3.6.9.  Secondary Endpoints   
The first secondary  endpoint is the differential measurement of red, green, and blue levels in VS tissue 
compared to the facial nerve and cochlear nerve using FS  and YE560. ImageJ software will be used to 
analyze representative images capture from microsurgery. The operating surgeon will delineate regions 
of interest for the VS, facial nerve, and cochlear nerve.  Separate similar analysis will be performed for 
othe r tumor types.  
 
The second secondary endpoint will incl ude gross total resection rate,  postoperative facial nerve 
function, and postoperative hearing status. Facial nerve function will be assessed by [CONTACT_751629] [ADDRESS_1028937] will 
not be tracked or reported. Other adverse effects of SF —urticaria, anaphylaxis, seizure, cardiac events, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] —will be tracked and reported up to [ADDRESS_1028938] through a craniotomy or translaby[CONTACT_751630].  
3. At the time of tumor exposure, p atients will be given intravenous FS. The timing and dose may vary. 
Maximum cumulative dose will not exceed 500 mg.  
• Initial dosing protocol will be 1 mg/kg intravenous FS. 
o If insufficient fluorescence is obtained or washout occurs, additional doses of 1 
mg/kg may be administered 
• Based on the experience of the first 3 cases, modifications to the dosing protocol may be made.  
o A higher, single dose may be administered if there is insufficient fluorescence or premature washout. Additional doses may be given during surgery.  
o If saturation of normal tissue with fluorescence occurs, the dose may be decreased or the FS may be administered at an earlier time  point (opening of 
dura, anesthesia induction, etc.)  during subsequent cases  
• Continued adjustments may be made to the dosing and timing, with a goal of standardizing the dose after 10 cases  
4. Once the VS  has been surgically exposed and FS has been administered, the YE560 fluorescence 
module shall be used to visualize fluorescence in the tissue. Images will be captured prior to tumor dissection, after exposure of the intracapsular tumor contents, and after maximum resection.  A pair of 
image s—one using the YE560 and one with white light microscopy —will be captured during each event.  
5. With the YE560 turned on, images will be captured with the microscope.  Video recording from the 
Pentero [ADDRESS_1028939]  will be 
reco rded and documented in the surgeon’s survey . Circulating nursing staff will record timestamps in 
collaboration with instruction from the operating surgeons.  
7. The YE560 module will be applied during the aforementioned events and additionally at the discretion 
of the operating surgeons . Depending upon the number of potential regions identified for imaging and 
for possible biopsies, the YE560 fluorescence module is expected to add less than 10 minutes to the overall procedure.  
8. At any time, the operating surgeon may turn off the YE560 module as dictated by [CONTACT_751631].  
9. Following completion  of tumor resection and prior to closing of the dura, supramaximal and minimum 
stimulation values will be obtained  (if relevant), as is standard practice with vestibular schwannoma 
microsurgery at our institution. The process is as described in Schmitt et al. (2013). In brief, transcutaneous bipolar electrodes are used at the extratemporal main trunk of the facial nerve to stimulate the nerve at 100 msec pulses increasing from 0 mA until a plateau amplitude compound muscle action potential is obtained. A Pr ass probe is used to stimulate the facial nerve proximal to the 
tumor (at the brainstem if possible) at increasing current (starting at 0 mA) until a plateau of CMAP is obtained. The ratio of these amplitude responses is calculated and subtracted from [ADDRESS_1028940] –procedure data analysis will include  analysis of surgeon survey responses and, red/green/blue 
component analysis  using ImageJ software . Additional data (demographics, imaging characteristics, 
facial nerve and audiometric data) will be reviewed and recorded from preoperative and 3 month 
postoperative visits. Video recordings will be edited to 30 -60 second videos following the case with 
representative views of the VS, facial nerve and cochlear nerve with and without the YE560 active. These 
edited videos will be used for the aforementioned surgeon validation study rating the correlation of fluorescence with w hite light microscopy.  
13. Upon completion of surgery, operating surgeons will complete the remainder of the paper survey 
(Appendix 3).  The surveys will be collected, with responses logged in the Rave database. The paper 
surveys will be stored in a secure location in the Otolaryngology department. 
3.7. Informed Consent Process   
Patients  under the care of the study investigators will be provided with the written informed consent 
form with plain language information about the research. The study will be explained to potential 
subjects, and they will be advised that participation is voluntary. Potential subjects will have the 
opportunity to ask ques tions of the study investigator before agreeing to participate and signing the 
consent form. Patients will not be coerced into the study. Any patient that chooses not to consent will undergo the standard microsurgical procedure and their health care will n ot be compromised in any 
way. Patients shall be free to withdraw from the study at any time.

Phase 2 
Study Design Randomized, double-blind, placeb o-controlled, parallel-group study 
Rationale Data from Phase 2 and 3 studies with interferon (IFN) α-blocking 
agents and a plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) antagonists have 
demonstrated improvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  or 
cutaneous lupus disease activity, s upporting the rationale for blocking 
the IFN pathways and pDCs in patie nts with SLE. Given the lack of 
highly efficacious and safe tr eatments for active SLE and the 
significant impact of this diseas e on health-related quality of life , there 
is currently a significant unmet need  for new targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Based 
on its mechanism of action  (binding to immunoglobulin-like 
transcript  7 (ILT7) on the surface of pDCs, thus inducing apoptosis and 
reduction in the number of pDCs), VIB7734 has the potential to 
decrease SLE disease activity. In addition, based on data currently 
available, VIB7734 presents an acceptable safety profile, and hence it is justified to evaluate its potential e fficacy in patients with active SLE. 
Target Population Adults aged ≥ 18 to ≤ [ADDRESS_1088112] moderate to severely active

 2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
2.1.1 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  
Clinical Presentation 
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ 
systems and is unpredictable in disease severity, with periods of illness or flares alternating with periods of remission. The diverse presentation of lupus can range from rash and arthritis, to anemia and thrombocytopenia, to serositis, nephriti s, seizures, and psychosis. At its onset, SLE 
may involve one or more organ systems, includi ng the musculoskeletal, cutaneous, vascular, 
renal, pulmonary, hematological, and nervous systems. Additional manifestations may occur over time. Disease prevalence is approximately one in 1000 individuals overall but varies with race and ethnicity. SLE is more common in women than in men (9:1 ratio), and is more common 
in African American, African Caribbean, Hisp anic, and Asian populations than Caucasians 
(Helmick et al, 2008; Feldman et al, 2013 ). Onset in women typi[INVESTIGATOR_789893]. Patients with SLE rate their health-related quality of life as significantly 
worse than patients with common chronic dise ases, such as hypertension and diabetes ( Jolly, 
2005), and they are chronically exposed to medication with significant side effects, such as, glucocorticoids (GCs) (typi[INVESTIGATOR_789894]) and immunosuppressive agents (King and Hahn, 2007 ). Fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and depressed mood and anxiety are 
frequent debilitating comorbidities in patients with SLE and are associated with decreased health-related quality of life ( Yurkovich et al, 2014, Schmeding and Schneider, [ADDRESS_1088116] 
et al, 2014, Lateef and Petri, 2014 , Palagini et al, 2013 ). 
Pathogenesis and Pathology 
The pathogenesis of SLE is based on mechanisms that lead to loss of tolerance against nuclear 
autoantigens ( Liu and Anders, 2014). SLE develops when autoimmunization occurs against 
nuclear autoantigens (eg, by [CONTACT_789928], opsonization, and 
rapid phagocytic clearance). Subsequently, endoge nous nucleic acids directly activate toll-like 
receptors (TLRs) on dendritic cells (DCs) or B cells that in turn drive interferon (IFN) α-driven 
immunity, antigen presentation, and the activat ion of autoreactive lymphocyte subsets. 
Activation of B cells and their maturation to plasma cells promotes autoantibody production. 
Complement activation and proinflammatory cytoki nes drive the inflammatory process that can 
cause organ injury, scarring, and chronic disease. 
The production of autoantibodies to a variety of nuclear antigens is a hallmark of SLE that 
accounts for some of the pathological findings ( Rahman and Isenberg, 2008 ; Jimenez et al, 2003 ; 
Petri et al, 2009). Serologically, a series of these autoantibodies are used routinely in clinical practice to further characterize the disease a nd risk for potential manifestations. These include

 Unmet Need 
GCs remain a therapeutic mainstay for short- and long-term control of disease activity in SLE 
and lupus nephritis (LN), and are often administer ed in combination with chloroquine derivatives 
(ie, antimalarials, including hydroxychloroquine sulfate) and immunosuppressants (eg, mycophenolate mofetil [MMF], methotrexate [M TX], azathioprine [AZA], cyclophosphamide, 
and cyclosporine) ( King and Hahn, 2007 ; Petri, 2006 ). The chloroquine derivatives are of 
moderate effectiveness and may prevent flar es, though breakthrough flares occur frequently, 
while the toxicity of the more aggressive drug regimens for SLE contributes significantly to 
morbidity and mortality ( King and Hahn, 2007 ; Petri, 2006 ; Ruiz-Arruza et al, 2014 ; Doria et 
al, 2014 ). 
Recently, more targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ie, monoclonal antibodies [mAbs]), have been utilized in the 
treatment of SLE. Inhibition of B lymphocyte stimulator (also known as B cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor [TNF] family) with belimumab (Benlysta
®) was shown to be safe 
and effective for SLE treatment ( Furie et al, 2011 ; Navarra et al, 2011 ). Belimumab was 
approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) in [ADDRESS_1088117] of care (SoC) demonstrated an incr eased rate of treatment response in SLE patients 
compared to those receiving placebo and SoC. In addition, results suggested that there was a 
reduced likelihood of severe flares and reduct ion in glucocorticoid (GC) doses. However, 
approximately 50% of the patients did not respond with a decrease in SLE activity when treated 
with belimumab. Therefore, there is a very high unmet medical need for novel, targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_789895]-risk ratio. 
2.1.2 VIB7734  
VIB7734 is a human immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 κ afucosylated mAb specific for human ILT7, a cell 
surface protein expressed by [CONTACT_789929] (pDCs) (Cho et al, 2008; Rissoan et al, 2002 ). 
VIB7734 binding to ILT7 on the surface of pDCs leads to recruitment of macrophages and 
natural killer (NK) cells, thus inducing apoptosis and reducing the number of pDCs. The afucosylation of VIB7734 is designed to improve the in-life potency of the molecule and to enhance the capacity for antibody-depende nt cellular toxicity against pDCs. 
2.1.3 Supportive Nonclinical Data  
ILT7 is expressed only on the pDCs of humans and non-human primates; therefore, the cynomolgus monkey was selected as the relevant species for safety evaluation of VIB7734.  
Study 8311616 was a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant, repeat-dose study in 
cynomolgus monkeys administered VIB7734 at  200 mg/kg intravenously (IV), 200 mg/kg 
subcutaneously (SC), and 400 mg/kg SC once weekly for 4 weeks (5 doses). No VIB7734-related clinical observations, body weight ch anges, ophthalmic observations, physical 
examination observations, macroscopic obse rvations, or changes in blood pressure or 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) were observed. VIB7 734 administration had no clear or consistent 
group effects on clinical pathology parameters. VIB 7734-related mild to moderate decreases of

 the group mean, absolute, and relative values of NK cells were observed in males given 200 or 
400 mg/kg SC and in females given 200 mg/kg IV  or SC and 400 mg/kg SC on Days 15 and 29 
of the dosing phase. VIB7734-related pDC depletion was observed at all dose groups starting on 
Day 2 of the dosing phase. pDC values were maintained at < 10% of mean Baseline values in the 
majority of animals on Day 29. By [CONTACT_2006] 209, mean pDC values returned to Baseline or approximately 50% of Baseline in animals administered 200 mg/kg IV and 200 or 400 mg/kg SC, respectively. No other VIB7734-relate d changes in peripheral blood immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_789896] (total T cells, helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, B cells, monocytes, and myeloid DCs) were 
observed in the blood, lymph nodes, and spleens of animals given ≥ 200 mg/kg IV or SC. 
VIB7734 had no effect on the ability to mount a T cell-dependent antibody response to primary or secondary administration of antigen, indi cating intact humoral immunity during VIB7734 
administration. 
Study 8338846 was a GLP-compliant, 6-month, repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. 
VIB7734 was administered once weekly via SC inj ection for 6 months (a total of 28 doses) at 
doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg/week. There were no VIB7734-related clinical, ophthalmic, body 
weight, or physical observations; no changes were observed in cardiac measurements or 
observations, or clinical or anatomic pathology. In addition, there were no VIB7734-related 
effects on reproductive organs or assessments. No VIB7734-related changes were noted for IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, or peripheral blood immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], except pDCs as expected by [CONTACT_253107]. VIB7734-related depletion of mean ab solute and relative values for pDCs was 
noted on Day 2 of the dosing phase in animals administered 200 or 400 mg/kg/week. The only VIB7734-related observation was a minor increase in mononuclear cell and macrophage infiltrates at the injection sites of animals administered VIB7734, compared with controls. These increases were not dose dependent, and partial re versibility was noted in recovery animals.  
Based on these results, the no-observed-adverse-ef fect-level is 200 mg/kg when given via IV 
infusion and 400 mg/kg/week when given by [CONTACT_638075]. Additional details of these and other 
nonclinical studies are included in the Investigator ’s Brochure . 
2.1.4 Risk Assessment for VIB7734  
There are no important identified risks for VIB7734. Important potential risks for VIB7734 may include viral infection and viral reactiva tion, opportunistic infection, malignancy, and 
hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis . More detailed descriptions of these potential 
risks are included in the I nvestigator’s Brochure. 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are a risk associated with administration of biologic drugs. Definitions for th ese reactions can be found in Appendix [ADDRESS_1088118] (IP) 
administration for immediate drug re actions. Hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis have not 
been observed in Phase 1 single-ascending dos e (SAD) and 1b multiple ascending dose (MAD) 
studies.

 [IP_ADDRESS] COVID-19 Risk Assessment  
An additional risk of study participation includes potential exposure of the participant to severe 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2, the virus that causes CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19), by [CONTACT_789930]. Sites mu st have a plan in place to minimize this 
risk. Although testing for COVID-[ADDRESS_1088119] performed locally in accordance  with his/her judgment based on participant risk. 
This test is not provided thr ough the study’s central laboratory, because the result of a test at 
Screening would not be appropriately timed to be  relevant to Dose 1. Such testing is not 
required. 
To minimize risk to participants, study sites w ill be activated to initiate participant enrollment 
only after review of local COVID-[ADDRESS_1088120] a difference in COVID-19 infection risk in 
persons with SLE compared to the general population except for what is known about the 
increased risk that may be associated with comorbid disease and use of immunosuppressive 
treatment. 
The Investigator will assess the benefit-risk for each individual participant for determination of 
suitability for enrollment based on known risk fa ctors for COVID-19 severity and possible or 
known exposure to SARS-CoV-2.  
Because of the evolving spread and con tainment measures of COVID-19, ongoing risk 
assessment will be required of partic ipating study sites and Investigators. 
2.1.5 Supportive Clinical Data  
VIB7734 has been investigated in Phase 1 SAD and Phase 1b MAD clinical studies in patients 
with autoimmune diseases (Studies D 6080C00001 and VIB7734.P1b.S1, respectively). Study 
D6080C00001 has been completed. Study VIB7734.P1b.S1 has a locked database and all clinic 
visits have been completed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1 Single-Ascending Dose Study in Pa tients With Autoimmune Diseases  
A Phase 1 SAD study (Study D6080C00001) of VIB7734 enrolled participants with any of 
5 autoimmune diseases: dermatomyositis, polymyositis, SLE, Sjö gren’s syndrome, and systemic 
sclerosis. Single SC doses of VIB7734 (1, 5, 15, 50, or 150 mg) or placebo were administered to 
36 participants. No safety, tolerability, or immunogenicity issues were identified. 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis showed a dose- dependent reduction in pDC levels, which was 
observable on Day 2 (one day after dosing on Ba seline [Day 1]) and maximal on Day 15. The 
duration of pDC reduction was largely dose depend ent and was reversible in all cases. Median 
pDC levels returned to above 50%  of Baseline at the followi ng time points for each cohort: 
1 mg: Day 29; 5 mg: Day 57; 15 mg: Day 57; a nd 50 mg: Day 85. The time to return to above 
50% of Baseline could not be de termined for 150 mg, since par ticipants met protocol-defined 
minimum absolute pDC number repletion criteria and exited the study before this occurred.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1b Multiple-Ascending Dose Study in Patients With Autoimmune Diseases  
In a single-blind (participants and site bli nded, Sponsor unblinded), Phase 1b MAD study (Study 
VIB7734.P1b.S1), VIB7734 or placebo was administ ered SC every 4 weeks (Q4W) for [ADDRESS_1088121] cohort, 8 participants with any of 
6 autoimmune diseases (dermatomyositis, polymyositis, SLE, cutaneous lupus erythematosus 
(CLE) , Sjögren’s syndrome, or syst emic sclerosis) were randomized to VIB7734 (5 mg SC) or 
placebo in a 3:[ADDRESS_1088122] cohorts enrolled participants with active cutaneous lupus, defined as a Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI)-
Activity (CLASI-A) score ≥ 8. In the second cohort, 12 pa rticipants were randomized to 
VIB7734 50 mg SC or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. In Cohort 3, 11 participants were randomized to VIB7734 150 mg SC or placebo in a 2:[ADDRESS_1088123] time point after dosing (Week 1) and 
persisted through the 3-month Treatment period. A high type I IFN signature [CONTACT_789962] 18 of 23 participants  (78%) in Cohorts 2 and 3. The median change in IFN signature 
[CONTACT_227241] 3 was -54% in the VIB7734 50 mg group, -83% in the VIB7734 150 mg group, and +8% in the placebo group. On the Month 3 skin  biopsy, the median change in pDC density 
was -87% for the 50 mg group, -99% for the 150 mg group, and -14% for the placebo group. The median change in CLASI-A from Baseline to Month 3 was -5 in the 50 mg group, -9.5 in the 
150 mg group, and -5 in the placebo group. At Month 3 , a ≥ 50% improvement in CLASI-A was 
observed in 38% of participants who received 50 mg VIB7734, 75% of participants who received 150 mg VIB7734, and 29% of participants who received placebo. The proportion of participants with an adverse event (AE) wa s similar in the VIB7734 and placebo groups (73% 
versus 67%, respectively). No se rious AEs (SAEs) or other clinically important AEs occurred in 
VIB7734-treated study participants.  
2.2 Study Rationale  
In the absence of exogenous triggers, DCs contribute to the clearance of dying cells and the 
maintenance of tolerance ( Klarquist et al, 2016 ; Huang et al, 2015 ). However, during infection or 
in the context of autoimmunity, DCs play a key role in activating cluster of differentiation (CD)[ADDRESS_1088124] amounts of IFN α via 
engagement of TLRs in response to viruses, in cluding virus-derived nucleic acids, and in 
response to lupus-related, nucleic ac id-containing immune complexes ( Siegal et al, 1999 ). While 
pDCs from healthy donors have been shown to induce suppressive T regulatory cell features 
(Foxp3 expression) in vitro, SLE pDCs failed to do so ( Jin et al, 2010). In mouse models, 
constitutive depletion of pDCs in lupus-prone mi ce resulted in markedly reduced type I IFN 
production, a reduced IFN signature, reduced autoantibody production, and reduction in the 
severity of kidney pat hology glomerulonephritis ( Rowland et al, 2014 ). Importantly, transient 
pDC depletion during the early stages of disease wa s sufficient to significantly alter the course of 
the disease, suggesting a more prominent role for pDCs in the induction of the disease than in 
disease pathogenesis at later stages of disease ( Rowland et al, 2014 ). Recent data from Phase [ADDRESS_1088125]-blocking agents (sifalimumab and anifrolumab) as well 
as another pDC antagonist (BIIB059) demonstrated improvement in SLE or cutaneous lupus disease activity, further supporting the rationa le for blocking the IFN pathway and pDCs in 
patients with SLE ( Furie et al, 2017 ; Furie et al, March 2019; Furie et al, November 2019 ; 
Khamashta et al, 2016 ; Morand et al, 2020; Werth et al, 2020 ).

 4 STUDY PLAN  
4.1 Study Design  
This study is a Phase 2, multicenter, internati onal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group trial to assess the efficacy and safety of VIB7734 in participants with moderate to 
severely active SLE.  
In this study, approximately 195 participants  will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 
(65 participants per group) to receive VIB 7734 200 mg Q4W SC, VIB7734 200 mg every 
12 weeks (Q12W) SC, with an additional 200 mg SC dose at Week 4, or placebo. To maintain 
blinding, participants randomized to the VIB7734 200 mg Q12W SC dosing regimen will receive 
SC placebo injections on dosing visits outside  the Q12W schedule. Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_191320] 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) total score at Screening ( ≥ 10 or 
< 10) and prednisone or equivalent ora l GC (OGC) dose at Baseline (Day 1) (≥ 10 mg or 
< 10 mg).  
The study will comprise a Screening period of approximately 4 weeks (Days -28 to -1), 
Randomization on Day 1, treatment and assessm ents through Week 48, and a Safety Follow-Up 
(SFU) period of 8 weeks (through Week 56). Under exceptional circumstances such as delayed 
laboratory results, drug washout, or the impact  of COVID-19, the Screening period may be 
increased by [ADDRESS_1088130] and second doses. Participants 
who prematurely stop dosing prior to Week 44 wi ll be followed through Week 56. Participants 
will not automatically be removed from the study if any administration of IP is missed. 
A long-term extension (LTE) study for safety and ef ficacy may be offered as part of a separate 
protocol, to participants who complete the Week 48 visit. Participants who enter the LTE study 
directly after completion of the Week 48 visit wi ll not complete the visits of the SFU period.  
The study design is summarized in Figure 1 .

 4.2 Dose and Treatment Rationale  
The VIB7734 SAD study demonstrated that the safety profile for single SC doses of 1 to 150 mg 
is acceptable (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Pharmacokinetic (PK) exposur e increased in an approximately 
dose-proportional manner. Increasing doses were a ssociated with an increase in maximal pDC 
reductions and a longer duration of pDC reduction. In the VIB7734 MAD study (Section [IP_ADDRESS]), up to [ADDRESS_1088131] an acceptable safety profile in patients with SLE, CLE , Sjögren’s  syndrome, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, and 
dermatomyositis. Treatment with VIB7734 resulted in rapid and durable depletion of blood pDCs in all patients receiving a 150 mg Q4W dos e. In addition, at Day 85, the median percent 
change from Baseline in CLASI-A was -59%  for patients receiving the 150 mg Q4W dose 
and -33% for the 50 mg Q4W dose, compared with -38% in the placebo-dosed group. 
In this Phase [ADDRESS_1088132] been selected to 
establish an exposure-response relationship. A nonclinical safety study of VIB7734 in 
cynomolgus monkeys provided sufficient PK ex posure coverage (over 300-fold) for the 
proposed clinical dose regimens to be evaluated in this study. The high dose selected to be 
evaluated in participants with moderate to seve rely active SLE is 200 mg Q4W. Furthermore, 
given the prolonged pDC suppression observed after completion of treatment in the MAD study 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]), a second dose regimen of [ADDRESS_1088133] on the primary 
and secondary outcome measures selected for this  study and current nonclinical safety data 
(Section 2.1.3) supports this treatment duration.  
4.[ADDRESS_1088134] moderate to severely active disease as defined by 
[CONTACT_341639]-2K, British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004 Index, and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) (Bombardier et al, 1992 ; Gladman et al, 2000). This active disease 
can either be a recent flare or chronic active dise ase. Failure of the Phase 2 trial of belimumab in 
SLE patients was attributed in part to the re lative lack of responsiveness in the approximately 
25% of patients with a negative  ANA or anti-dsDNA at Screening compared to those with a 
positive serology ( Wallace et al, 2009 ). The responsiveness of seropositive patients was 
corroborated by [CONTACT_789933]-52 and BLISS-76 belimumab 
trials that included only seropositive patients ( Furie et al, 2011 ; Navarra et al, 2011 ). Hence, the 
presence of a positive ANA and/or autoantibodies with high specificity for SLE are a mandatory criterion for enrollment in this study. 
Stabilization of the SLE treatment regimen in SLE participants prior to Baseline (Day 1) 
decreases the confounding of the study results by [CONTACT_3433] e SoC (ie, changes in disease activity post-
Baseline [Day 1] are more likely to be attri butable to the introduction of VIB7734, rather than a 
change in background therapy). Severe central nervous system (CNS) lupus and LN may be less responsive to therapy than other 
manifestations or may require different treatment regimens (eg, cyclophosphamide, IV Ig, high-
dose mycophenolate) than typi[INVESTIGATOR_789897]. Therefore, these individuals will be 
Clinical Study Protocol Viela Bio, Inc. 
VIB7734.P2.S1 Version 2.0, [ADDRESS_1088135] advance d, fixed disease that will not be responsive to 
therapy, and furthermore, these individuals are at higher risk for AEs.  
A urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCr) of up to 3 mg/mg is allowed. This limit is applied 
because higher levels of proteinuria increase the risk of AEs. 
The recent or ongoing use of systemic GCs for any co morbidities other than SLE is excluded. 
Such use would confound the analysis of the effect of VIB7734 on SLE activity. In addition, it 
would confound the analysis of the potential GC-sparing effects of VIB7734, which is a component of the primary objective of the study. Individuals with active or significant recent 
infection are excluded to avoid possible recurr ence or worsening. Individuals with active or 
untreated latent tuberculosis (TB) infection or hepatitis B or C infection are excluded to avoid 
the risk of reactivation. A number of abnormalities or interventions known to interfere with the immune system are excluded to avoid possible confounding of the VIB7734 efficacy and safety profile. In terms of cardiac risk, individuals with an increased risk of recurrent cardiovascular 
events (those with a recent event) and/or signifi cant arrhythmia will be  excluded to decrease 
potential confounding of study outcomes. Randomization of a screened participant will require 
review to confirm that all relevant inclusi on and exclusion criteria have been applied in 
consideration of the participant’s eligibility . The protocol contains specific inclusion and 
exclusion criteria; however, not every possible clinic al scenario can be addressed in the protocol. 
The impetus for this requirement has been the obse rvance in other studies that some participants 
enrolled in trials are not considered appropriat e participants by [CONTACT_789934]. The 
most common reasons for exclusion in trials are the presence of certain comorbidities as well as 
the absence of sufficient SLE activity. Participants failing to be randomized (ie, screen failures) may be rescreened once for participation with Medical Monitor approval. 
4.4 Rationale for the Prim ary Outcome Measure  
The primary outcome measure is the proportion of participants achieving a BILAG 2004 Index-
based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA) response and an oral (PO) prednisone (or 
equivalent) dose of 侓 7.5 mg/day and 侓 Baseline (Day 1) dose at Week 48. The BICLA is driven 
by [CONTACT_692967] 2004 Index score, which measures organ-specific activity 
(Wallace et al, 2011 ). The BILAG 2004 Index incorporates a comprehensive, organ-specific, 
97-question assessment, which requires the Inve stigator to score organ manifestations as 
improving, same, worse, or new over the previous 4 we eks. The scores (A, B, C, D) derived from 
the assessments (improving, same, worse, or new, respectively) will determine whether further 
treatment is needed to resolve disease activit y. The change in treatment does not determine the 
scoring ( Yee et al, 2009 ).  
The BICLA was used as the primary endpoint in a Phase 2b trial of epratuzumab ( Wallace et al, 
2014) and in a Phase 3 trial of anifrolumab ( Morand et al, 2020 ). Given the clinical relevance for 
the use of BICLA and its ability to  discern effect as suggested in the anifrolumab Phase 3 study, 
the BICLA was selected as the clinical disease activity assessment for the primary outcome measure. In addition, there is a requirement to achieve and maintain an PO prednisone or 
equivalent dose of 侓 7.5 mg/day and 侓 Baseline (Day 1) dose for at least [ADDRESS_1088136] their GCs tapered, but with higher

 v. Methotrexate (MTX) (participants must be  on concomitant folic or folinic acid 
supplementation if using MTX) 
vi. Voclosporin (if approved for treatment) 
vii. GCs are permitted but not required if a pa rticipant is receiving at least one other 
medication listed above. If GCs are us ed in combination with allowed DMARDs 
or immunosuppressants, they must be at an average daily dose of PO prednisone 
≤ 40 mg (or prednisone equivalent) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1088139] be kept stable for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to Randomization. Daily dosing or alternate  day dosing of PO prednisone (or 
prednisone equivalent) is allowed. 
b. Treatment with OGC monotherapy (without the concomitant use of DMARDs or 
immunosuppressants): 
i. Average daily dose of PO prednisone ≥ 10 mg but ≤ 40 mg (or prednisone 
equivalent) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1088140] be kept stable for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to Randomization. Daily dosing or alternate day dosing of PO prednisone (or prednisone equivalent) is allowed. 
8. Women of childbearing potential must have a nega tive serum pregnancy test at Screening 
and a negative urine pregnanc y test at Randomization. Women of childbearing potential 
are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (ie, surgical sterilization includes bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) or those who are not postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause and a follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH ] within the postmenopausal range as 
established by [CONTACT_2237], unle ss on postmenopausal hormone replacement 
therapy).  Women of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception ( Table 1) from 
signing of the informed consent, and must a gree to continue using such precautions 
through the end of the study follow-up or 3 months (approximately 5 half-lives) following the last dose of IP in the case of early withdrawal from the study, and refrain from egg retrieval/egg donati on during this period. A decision about contraception after 
this point should be made by [CONTACT_789936].  Sustained abstinence is an acceptable practic e; however periodic abstinence, the rhythm 
method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.   Note that because mycophenolate affects the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives and 
may reduce their effectiveness in women receiving MMF or MPA who are using hormonal contraceptives for birth control, the participant must employ an additional contraceptive method (eg, barrier method).

a A change in birth control meth od is allowed during the study. If a change occurs, unless the patient is changing 
the method to complete abstinence, the patien t must employ a barrier met hod in addition to the highly 
effective method of contraception for at least two months. 
b This is also considered to be a hormonal method. 
c A vasectomized partner is a highly effective method of birth control provided that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the woman of childbearing potential study participant and that the vasectomized partner has 
received medical assessment of the surgical success. 
d Sexual abstinence is considered to be a highly effective method only if de fined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period  of the study and if it is the pr eferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
e Progestogen-only hormonal contraception where inhibitio n of ovulation is not the primary mode of action 
(minipi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) is not accepted as  a highly effective method. 
9. Non-sterilized male participants who are se xually active with a woman partner of 
childbearing potential must agree to use a condom with spermicide from Randomization 
and until 3 months (approximately 5 half-lives ) after receipt of the last dose. Because a 
male condom with spermicide is not a highly effective contraception method, it is 
strongly recommended that male participants advise their wo men partners of childbearing 
potential to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout this period (refer to Table 1 ). 
5.2 Exclusion Criteria

Follow-Up visits will be conducted at [ADDRESS_1088155] (IP) for 
participants who have completed the 48-week Tr eatment period. These assessments, however, will not be 
performed on participants who enter the long-term extension study.   
Participants who permanently discontinue IP  at any point in the study but who do not  withdraw consent of study 
participation will complete all study visits through Study Week 48/ET and at least [ADDRESS_1088156] dose of IP. Participants who permanently di scontinue IP at any point in the study and who do

that will be used on all participant documentation.  SIDs will be assigned in ascending sequential 
order. Rescreened participants will receive a new SID.  On Day 1, the Investigator will confirm that all eligibility criteria still are fulfilled prior to 
Randomization, including that the SLEDAI-2K eligibility criteria (Section 5.1; Item 5), OGC 
dose, and dose and route of other permitted im munosuppressants have been stable during the 
Screening period as defined in the eligibility criteria [Section 5]). 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_257441]- 2K score at Screening ( ≥ 10 or < 10) and 
prednisone or equivalent OG C dose at Baseline (Day 1) (≥ 10 mg or < 10 mg). Stratification is 
implemented in order to minimize risk f or Baseline imbalances across treatment groups on 
disease activity and OGC dose/use. Baseline imbalances of disease activity and OGC dose/use impact efficacy and/or safety assessments of VIB7734 versus placebo. 
6.3.2 Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy measurements will be made at the times indicated in Section 6.2; refer to Table 2 , 
Table 3 , and Table 4  for Screening, treatment, and follow-up assessments and procedures. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Training Provision and Requirements  
The Sponsor or designee will provide necessary training to instruct the Investigators, study 
coordinators, and other applicable site staff to ensure appropriate study conduct. This training 
will include information on the protocol, study pr ocedures including completion of the lupus 
assessments, the completion of the case report form s (CRFs), and other identified training topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. 
Training will include printed training materials, online videos and formal presentations, as well 
as web-based training modules. Required trainings will be documented in the Site Training Plan. 
All assessments and certifications must be renewed prior to expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. If there is a change in site personnel over the course of the study, new Investig ators or physicians must complete all the

 required training prior to performing study procedures. Documentation of completed training 
will be filed in the Investigator Si te File and the Trial Master File. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1088160] be administered by [CONTACT_789939] n, unless prior Sponsor approval has been obtained for any other 
clinically trained site personnel with documenta tion of adequate assessment experience.
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_789902]. The lupus assessments will be  reviewed centrally by a team designated by [CONTACT_789940].  
Assessment scores will be programmatically derived and reviewed centrally. Additional 
information regarding programmatic calculation incl uding any data imputation considerations 
will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Prior to Randomization, the Sponsor or designee Medical Monitor will confirm the Investigator’s 
assessment of participant eligibility based on specified data to be reviewed centrally. This confirmation must be obtained prior to Randomizat ion. If the central review team does not agree 
on participant disease activity level for eligibility, the Sponsor and/or an external unbiased 
consultant may be consulted for input. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_789903]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Efficacy Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1088161] ation is “present” or “absent” within the last 4 weeks. The 
assessment also includes the collection of blood and urine for assessment of the laboratory 
categories of the SLEDAI-2K. 
The SLEDAI-2K assessment consists of 24 lupus-related items. It is a weighted instrument, in 
which descriptors are multiplied by [CONTACT_789941]’s  “weight”. For example, renal descriptors are 
multiplied by 4 and CNS descriptors by 8; these weighted organ manifestations are totaled into 
the final score. The SLEDAI-2K scores are valid, re liable, and sensitive clinical assessments of 
lupus disease activity. The SLEDAI -2K, calculated using a timeframe of 30 days prior to a visit 
for clinical and laboratory values, has been shown to be like the SLEDAI-2K with a 10-day 
window ( Touma et al, 2010 ). A timeframe of 28 days (± allo wed visit window) will be used in 
this study.

 [IP_ADDRESS].2 British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 Index  
The BILAG 2004 Index is a translational index with 9 systems (General, Mucocutaneous, 
Neuropsychiatric, Musculoskeletal, Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_83731], Gastrointestinal, Ophthalmic, Renal, and 
Hematology) that can capture the changing severi ty of clinical manifestations. It has ordinal 
scales by [CONTACT_692979] a global score;  rather it captures disease activity across the 
different systems at a glance by [CONTACT_789942] 4 weeks to the 4 weeks preceding them. It is based on the principle of physicians’ intention to treat and categorizes disease activity 
into 5 different levels, from A to E: 
x Grade A represents very active disease requiring immunosuppressive drugs and/or a 
prednisone dose of > 20 mg/day or equivalent. 
x Grade B represents moderate disease activity requiring a lower dose of GCs, topi[INVESTIGATOR_789904], 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_588566], antimalarials, or NSAIDs. 
x Grade C indicates mild stable disease. 
x Grade D implies no disease activity, but the system has previously been affected. 
x Grade E indicates no current or previous disease activity. 
Although the BILAG 2004 Index was developed based on the principle of intent to treat, the 
treatment has no bearing on the scoring index. Only the presence of active manifestations 
influences the scoring. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1088162] been 
reviewed . The PGA represents the physician’s overall assessment of average SLE disease 
severity on a VAS with 0 (no disease) to 3 (severe) disease activity over the previous [ADDRESS_1088163] severe disease possible; it does not reflect 
the most severe disease observed in a particular participant, but the most severe disease ever 
observed in all SLE participants. Therefore,  the line made along this scale by [CONTACT_789943]. Any dise ase rated greater than 2.5 is very severe. The 
range of moderate disease covers approximately 1.5 to 2.4. Mild disease falls below 1.5. The 
instrument is like a logarithmic scale, with greater distances or demarcations possible among 
more mild-moderate symptoms. 
When scoring the PGA, the score from the previous visit should be reviewed and the mark 
should be moved relative to the score from the previous visit. This is a global assessment, 
factoring in all aspects of the participant ’s lupus disease activity. It should not reflect non -lupus 
medical conditions.

 [IP_ADDRESS].4 Lupus Low Disease Activity State  
The Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) is  a composite measure of SLE disease activity 
that has been utilized in clinical trials ( Franklyn et al, 2016 ). LLDAS is defined and measured by 
[CONTACT_789944] 5 criteria:  
1. SLEDAI- 2K ≤  4, with no activity in major organ systems (renal, CNS, cardiopulmonary, 
vasculitis, fever) and no hemolytic anemia or gastrointestinal activity,  
2. No new lupus disease activity compared with the previous assessment (SLEDAI-2K),  
3. PGA ≤ 1 (scale 0 to 3), 
4. A current prednisone (or equivalent) dose ≤  7.[ADDRESS_1088164] maintenance doses of immunosuppressive drugs and approved 
biological agents (Franklyn et al, 2016). 
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Oral Glucocorticoid Reduction  
Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].2  for all information regarding OGC tapering. 
[IP_ADDRESS].7 Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index  
The CLASI is a validated index used for assessing the cutaneous lesions of SLE and consists of 2 separate scores: the first summarizes the infl ammatory activity of the disease; the second is a 
measure of the damage done by [CONTACT_90050]. The activity score considers erythema, scale/hypertrophy, mucus membrane lesions, recent hair loss, and non-scarring alopecia. The damage score represents dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scarring/atrophy/panniculitis, and scarring of the scalp. Participants are asked if their dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_789905] [ADDRESS_1088165] (AESIs), vital signs, physical 
examinations, safety laboratory tests, and ECGs. Safety assessments will be performed at the 
visits specified in Section 6.2; refer to Table 2 , Table 3 , and Table 4  for Screening, treatment, 
and follow-up assessments and procedures. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
AEs, SAEs, and AESIs are defined in Section 8.1. Recording of AEs is described in Section 8.2 
and reporting of SAEs and AESIs is described in Section 8.3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital signs, blood pressure (mmHg), pulse rate (b eats/min), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths/min), body 
temperature (ºC), and body weight (kg) will be obtained at Screening, treatment, and follow-up 
as outlined in Table [ADDRESS_1088166] 5 minutes before each reading and, when possible, should be taken before any blood draws. Prior to and after IP administra tion, vital signs should 
be checked as follows:  
x Within 15 minutes prior to administration of IP (within 30 minutes for Week 24 due to the ECG requirements).  
x Every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) for 60 minu tes after administration or until stable, 
whichever is later (for the first 2 study visits only).  
If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity reaction occurs  after the SC administration of IP, vital signs 
will be taken more frequently, based on Investigator judgment and as warranted by [CONTACT_477800] (Appendix 1 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination  
Body height will be collected at Screening only. Pa rticipants will be weighed at each study visit. 
Medically significant changes from the Screening physical examination will be recorded as AEs, 
unless they are considered a manifestation of SLE and captured on the BILAG 2004 Index, SLEDAI-2K, or CLASI. 
A focused physical examination should be performed at all visits, except for Baseline (Day 1) 
and Week 48 (Day 337)/Early Termination visits , where a complete physical examination should 
be performed.

VIB7734.P2.S1 Version 2.0, 10 February 2022 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY Page 60 of 106  
 A focused physical examination should always include assessment of head, ears, eyes, nose, 
throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, skin, and extre mities. A complete physical examination should 
include all organ systems; a genital, rectal, and breast examination can be omitted from the complete physical examination unless clinically indicated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram  
A computerized 12-lead ECG will be perform ed at the visits specified in Section 6.2; refer to 
Table [ADDRESS_1088167] in a 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Chest X-Ray  
A chest X-ray will be performed at Screeni ng. Results of a chest X-ray (posterior-anterior, 
anterior-posterior, and lateral views) performe d within 12 weeks of the Screening visit (if 
available) are acceptable, provided there is no reason to suspect any clinical changes. If 
performed at Screening, posterior-anterior and lateral views should be evaluated, unless where 
prohibited by [CONTACT_14306]. Magnetic re sonance imaging or computed tomography scans 
of the chest performed within 12 weeks of the Screening visit are acceptable. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tuberculosis Assessment  
A blood test for TB will be performed at Screen ing using the IGRA test (ie, QuantiFERON-TB 
Gold Plus or T-SPOT). Evaluation of all participan ts by [CONTACT_789945]. Results of an IGRA test performed at a local laboratory within 12 
weeks of the Screening visit (if available) are ac ceptable, provided there is no reason to suspect 
any re-exposure.  6.3.4 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
All clinical laboratory tests will be performed at a central laboratory at the visits specified in 
Section 6.2; refer to Table [ADDRESS_1088168] (in women of childbearing potential as defined in Inclusion Criteria #8) will be performed at Screening at the central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed 
in women of childbearing potential during treatment and follow-up at the site using a dipstick. 
Abnormal safety laboratory results should be repea ted as clinically indicated, as soon as possible 
(preferably within 24 to 48 hours). 
Additional safety samples may be collected as clinically indicated at the discretion of the 
Investigator. 
Every attempt should be made to redraw any mi ssing safety laboratory tests, even if the 
participant has received the IP.

 The Investigator should assess the available re sults with regards to clinically relevant 
abnormalities.  
For suspected hemolytic anemia, a haptoglobin level should be tested, if needed, for 
confirmation. For suspected APS, anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM), anti- β2-
glycoprotein 1 antibody, and lupus anticoagulant should be tested.  The laboratory results should be signed and dated a nd retained at the site as source data for 
laboratory variables.  Clinical laboratory tests are presented in Table 5 .

stoppered with a 13-mm elastomeric stopper, and se aled with flip-off cap overseal. Allow the 
kits to equilibrate to room temperature a bout 30 minutes prior to dose preparation.   
No incompatibilities between VIB7734 and plastic syringes (ie, polypropylene and 
polycarbonate) have been observed. 
VIB7734 does not contain preservatives and any un used portion must be discarded. Total in-use 
storage time from needle puncture of the IP vial to start of administration should not exceed 
[ADDRESS_1088176] not exceed 4 hours. DO NOT FREEZE. 
A SC dose of 200 mg VIB7734 will be administered over 2 injections. To prepare each injection, 
withdraw 1 mL of IP into a 1-mL syringe using a 1½-inch needle. For SC dose administration, a 
27G ½-inch needle should be used. Normal saline will be used as placebo. The numbe r and volume of placebo injections will match 
that of active drug. Saline (1 mL) should be drawn into each of two 1-mL syringes using a 1½-
inch needle. For SC dose administration, a 27G ½-inch needle should be used.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigational Product Dosing and Administration  
The first day of dosing is considered Day 1. To reduce the risk of unblinding the study personnel 
who will be evaluating the participant, IP will  be administered by [CONTACT_21703]/IP 
Manager or a study site staff member who is not otherwise involved in the participant’s  
participation in the study. The IP administrator should be experienced in performing SC 
injections. The skin s urface of the anterolateral thigh, upper outer triceps area, upper buttocks, or 
abdomen (avoiding a 2-inch [5 cm] radius around  the umbilicus) should be prepared with an 
alcohol wipe and allowed to air dry. The skin w ill be pi[INVESTIGATOR_789906]. The needle will be inserted at a 90-d egree angle to the skin surface approximately 
halfway into the SC tissue. The prepared IP will be slowly injected (at least 5-second duration is recommended per 1 mL syringe) into the SC tissue using gentle pressure. The area should not be 
massaged after injection. The SC injection site can be changed during the study as per participant 
preference. 
The IP should NOT be administered if it has be en at room temperature for more than 4 hours, or 
if it has been at for more than 24 hours. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Dose Administration  
Participants should be monitored under direct obse rvation for at least [ADDRESS_1088177] 
and second doses of IP administration or until th e participant is stable, whichever is longer. Vital 
signs should be measured as indicated in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dos e administration are possible. Therefore, 
appropriate drugs and medical equipment to tr eat acute anaphylactic reactions must be 
immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.

research organization (CRO) Staff only. An unblinded Study Monitor will perform IP 
accountability and compliance monitoring during the study. A qualified study site staff member will only administer the study product to partic ipants included in this study and according to 
procedures established in this study protocol. Th ere is potential of unblinding of staff members 
who administer the study product, however, they w ill not be involved in any other parts of the 
study. Each administration of study product will be documented and transferred to the electronic 
CRF (eCRF).

be assessed based on this information. 7.3 Treatment Assignment and Bias Minimization  
7.3.1 Randomization Strate gy and Procedure  
An interactive voice/web response system (IXRS) will be used for Randomization to a treatment 
group and assignment of IP kit numbers. A participant is considered randomized into the study 
when the Investigator or appropriate designee notifies the IXRS that the participant meets eligibility criteria and the IXRS prov ides the assignment of treatment group. 
Additional details are provided in the IXRS manual. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1088180]/ IP manager at the site. Because VIB7734 and 
placebo could be distinguished during administrati on, the IP will be administered by [CONTACT_789949]/IP manager or site personnel who will not be involve d in management of 
the study participants. To maintain blinding, participants randomized to VIB7734 Q12W SC 
dosing regimen will receive SC placebo injections  on study visits outside the Q12W schedule.  
Neither the participant nor any of the Investigator or Sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the participants will be aware of the treatment 
received. If treatment allocation for a particip ant becomes known to the Investigator or other 
study staff in the management of study particip ants, the Sponsor must be notified immediately. 
7.3.3 Unblinding Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding in the Event of a Medical Emergency  
In the event of a medical emergency, the Investigator may unblind an individual participant ’s IP 
allocation. Instructions for unblinding an individual participant ’s IP allocation are contained in 
the IXRS manual. In general, unblinding should only occur if management of the medical emergency would be different ba sed on the participant having received VIB7734. In most cases,

 the management of a medical emergency woul d be the same whether or not VIB7734 was 
received by [CONTACT_2299]. If this was the case, the IP allocation should not be unblinded. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding for the Interim Analysis  
The interim analysis will be conducted after all pa rticipants have completed the Week [ADDRESS_1088181] be recorded in the c orresponding section of the eCRF, noting the name, 
dose, duration, and indication of each drug. 7.4.1 Medications Prohibited Prior to Screening or Randomization  
The treatments and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_180568] 7  are not permitted prior to Screening or 
Randomization with specific usage washout periods provided for each treatment. Additionally, 
these treatments should not be used during the tria l (with exceptions as noted for those therapi[INVESTIGATOR_789907] [IP_ADDRESS]).

 7.4.3 Permitted Medications  
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Medications and Treatments  
All concomitant medications, from the time of the Screening visit, taken while the participant is 
participating in the study will be recorded on the eCRF. Participants must be instructed not to 
take any medications, including over-the-counter  or herbal products or ayurvedic medications 
without first consulting the Investigator. 
Permitted medications (including rescue medications) are any medications required per the 
medical history and not specifically prohibited by [CONTACT_789950] (ie, from Screening to the end of the SFU period). Any such medications prescribed or used should be recorded in the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Medications for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Standard of Care

discontinued according to the specifications in  the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Section 5) for 
a participant to be eligible for the study. These medications must remain stable during the Screening and Treatment periods except for OGC a nd NSAIDs, which can be adjusted as long as 
doses are consistent with the parameters as indicated in Sections  [IP_ADDRESS].2 and [IP_ADDRESS].2.6 , 
respectively. Background thera py may only be changed for documented safety issues. The 
toxicity/event must be confirmed as a documented  AE. The dose can be returned to the Baseline

 (Day 1) level if the toxicity/event resolves and if clinically indicated. Initiation of any new 
immunosuppressant or immunomodulator therapy or incr ease in dose above th e Baseline (Day 1) 
level would be considered a treatment failure and may result in withdrawal of the participant 
from the IP (per Sponsor Medical Monitor discretion).  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Glucocorticoids  
OGCs are permitted but not required for particip ation in the study as outlined in the inclusion 
criteria [Section 5.1]). OGCs other than prednisone may be used at equivalent PO doses (refer to 
Appendix 4 ). Investigators are required to decrease the OGC dose as much as tolerated by [CONTACT_789951] 4 up until Week 36 of the Treatment period, within the rules for dose 
changes outlined below. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.[ADDRESS_1088183] been 
completed and IP has been administered. Taperi ng can be started on the scheduled study visit 
day (eg, Week 4 Visit) based on clinical manifestations and the laboratory values from the previous visit. If laboratory values of the c urrent visit show SLE activity consistent with 
Exception Rule [ADDRESS_1088184] possible OGC dose, including discontinuation of the OGC, if clinically feasible. Note that there is no change in OGC dose permitt ed between Week 20 and 
Week 24. Beginning at Week 4 and continuing through Week 36, tapering to an OGC dose of 
≤ 7.5 mg/day MUST be attempted at all visits in all participants with OGC dose of > 7.5 mg/day, 
unless at least one of the following criteria (Exception Rules) is met: 
1. SLEDAI-2K activity which is worsened comp ared to Baseline (Day 1) in major organ 
systems (renal, CNS, cardiopulmonary, vasc ulitis, fever, thrombocytopenia), hemolytic 
anemia, or increased gastrointestinal activity. 
2. Newly affected organ system(s) based on the SLEDAI-2K, excluding serological abnormalities (dsDNA antibodies, hypocomplementemia). 
3. Moderate to severe skin disease as reflected by a CLASI- A score ≥  10. 
4. Moderate to severe arthritis as reflected by ≥ 8 tender and/or swollen joints. 
If OGC tapering is not attempted in an eligib le participant, the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee 
must be contact[CONTACT_15608]. An example of suggested OGC tapering regimen is provided in Appendix [ADDRESS_1088185] flexibility in how the OGC dose 
is reduced at each visit. 
Investigators will not be required to, but are encouraged to, taper OGC dose beyond the target of 
7.5 mg/day including discontinuation of OGC up to Week 36, if clinically feasible. Tapering will 
not be permitted after Week 36. A participant ex periencing an increase in disease activity 
secondary to OGC tapering may increase the OGC dose up to a maximum of the Baseline (Day 1) OGC therapy dose between Week 4 up to  Week 36. Participants who require an OGC 
dose above their Baseline (Day 1) level may continue in the study but could be considered 
nonresponders for subsequent assessments of disease activity.

to Week 12 for increased SLE disease activit y/non-SLE activity as outlined below.  
A GC burst is defined as receipt of only one of the following: 
x An OGC increase above Baseline (Day 1)  up to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg/day 
prednisone (or equivalent) for up to a total of [ADDRESS_1088188] be fully administered and tapered to less than or equal to the Base line (Day 1) dose by [CONTACT_2671] 14th day. 
Any course of OGC above the Baseline (Day 1) dose mu st not extend beyond Week 12, 
regardless of when the course was started. 
x Intramuscular methylprednisolo ne (≤  80 mg) or equivalent administered as a single dose 
between Baseline (Day 1) and Week 10. 
x A maximum of 2 intra-articular/tendon sh eath/bursal injections (for a total 
methylprednisolone dose of ≤ 80 mg or equivalent) can be given between Baseline 
(Day 1) and Week 10.  
Participants who receive more than one OGC burst and taper between Baseline (Day 1) and prior 
to Week 12, or who violate any of the criteria above, may continue in the study, but will be 
considered nonresponders for subsequent assessm ents of disease activity, regardless of whether 
the OGC burst was administered for increased SLE activity or non-SLE causes. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.3 Increase in OGC from Week 12 to Week 36  
Between Week 12 and Week 36, an increase in  OGC dose above Baseline (Day 1) dose for 
increased SLE activity is NOT allowed. A partic ipant receiving an OGC dose above his or her 
Baseline (Day 1) dose after Week 12 for SLE may c ontinue in the study but will be considered a 
nonresponder for subsequent assessments of disease activity.  
An increase in OGC above current dose for non-S LE causes (eg, asthma or chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease exacerbation) is allowed ONCE either between Week 12 and Week 20 ahead 
of planned interim analysis time point at Week 24 OR between Week 24 (after all assessments 
complete) and Week 36. This might include a non- SLE OGC dose up to ≤ 20 mg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent for up to a total of [ADDRESS_1088189] 
and by [CONTACT_56421] 20 Visit day (if the increase is implemented between Week 12 and Week 20) or 
by [CONTACT_56421] 36 Visit day (if the increase is implemented between Week 24 and Week 36).  
Participants who receive an increase in OG C for non-SLE causes at a dose of > 20 mg/day 
prednisone (or equivalent) OR a bove Baseline (Day 1) dose for > 10 days will be considered 
nonresponders for subsequent assessments of disease activity. If a participant receives > 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent or a dose above Baseline (D ay 1) level for more than [ADDRESS_1088190] 
be reported to the Medical Monitor. The Medical Monitor will determine with the Sponsor if the 
participant may continue to receive IP based on the assessment of potential risk.

 [IP_ADDRESS].2.4 Oral Glucocorticoids After Week 36  
No change in OGC is allowed after Week 36. Participants who receive an increase in their OGC 
dose above 7.5 mg/day or Baseline (Day 1) dose after Week 36 will be considered nonresponders 
for the primary and secondary outcome measures at Week 48.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.[ADDRESS_1088191] and tapers descri bed above, participants who are taking ≤ 7.5 mg/day 
prednisone or equivalent will be allowed to receive up to an additional 7.5 mg/day to a total of 
15 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for a total of up to 14 days or a single course of IV hydrocortisone ( ≤ 100 mg hydrocortisone followed by [CONTACT_153285] 2 days before returning 
to their usual dose of OGC) for surgery or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or GC withdrawal 
if clinically warranted from Baseline (Day 1) to Week 36. The non-SLE indication must be 
clearly indicated in the source documents. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.6 Other  
For all enrolled participants, additional treatments  given to participants with SLE are permitted 
during the study as follows: 
x Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers 
 If used at Screening, it is recommended that they be maintained at a stable dose 
during the trial, unless dose change, discont inuation, or initiation is required for 
documented safety reasons. 
x Anti-COVID therapeutic antibodies   If used during the study, the medical monitor must be notified immediately, and 
continuation of IP will be deter mined on a case by [CONTACT_413].   
x Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]   Low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ( ≤ 350 mg/day) may be used for ca rdiovascular prophylaxis; this is

 x NSAIDs 
 Regularly prescribed NSAIDs may not be initiated during the 48-week Treatment 
period. 
 Participants taking a NSAID (including cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors; topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], 
prescription, or over-the-counter) on a regular schedule for SLE symptoms at 
Randomization can continue to do so throughout the trial at a stable dose. 
 NSAIDs should not be taken on visit days until all assessments are complete. 
Participants may have the dose adjusted dur ing the trial for documented toxicity/safety 
reasons.  Any NSAIDs (whether prescription, over-the-counter, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) should not be used 
above the maximum allowable doses per local labeling, and site should perform regular 
AE monitoring of these concomitant medications.  
 PRN NSAIDs not exceeding label-approved doses are permitted for SLE or non-SLE 
pain as required based on Investigator judg ment for up to 10 consecutive days  Duration 
exceeding 10 consecutive days is considered chronic use.  
x Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]

8.1 Definitions  
x Adverse event (AE)  – An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of an intervention in humans whether or not  it is considered intervention-related. 
x Serious adverse event (SAE)  – An event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death 
 A life-threatening AE (An event is considered nlife-threatening | if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant or participant at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.) 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411] 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the participan t or participant and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outco mes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
x Adverse reaction  – An adverse reaction is any AE caused by a drug. 
x Adverse event of special interest (AESI) – An AESI is an AE of scientific and medical 
interest specific to understanding of the IP and may require close monitoring and 
collection of additional information by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator. An AESI may be serious or 
nonserious. 
 The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of this IP.  The following AESIs will be particularly monitored in this study: 
 Hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis. 
 Severe (Grade 3 or higher) viral infections/reactivations.

  Opportunistic infection listed in Appendix 3  (all cases). 
 Malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancer). 
8.[ADDRESS_1088194] already been recorded due to other AEs or SAEs. 
Worsening or new manifestations of SLE (eg, those captured by [CONTACT_257441]-2K, BILAG 2004 Index, or CLASI) do not have to be reported as AEs, unless they meet the criteria for a SAE. All AEs meeting criteria must be reported immediately.  
For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date 
and time), severity, causality, action taken, serious  outcome (if applicable), and whether it caused 
the participant to discontinue the study. The AE  term should be reported in standard medical 
terminology when possible. 
8.2.1 Causality or Relatedness  
The Investigator is required to provide an assessment of the relationship of AEs and SAEs to the 
IP. An event will be considered “not related” to use of IP if any of the following tests are met:  
x An unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of the IP and the onset of the event (eg, the event occurred either befor e, or too long after, administration of the IP 
for it to be considered IP related). 
x A causal relationship between the IP and the event is biologically implausible (eg, death 
as a passenger in an automobile accident). 
x A clearly more likely alternative explanation for the event is present (eg, typi[INVESTIGATOR_56664] a concomitant drug and/or typi[INVESTIGATOR_5194]-related event). 
Individual AE/SAE reports will be considered “related” to use of the IP if the “not related” criteria are not met. 
“Related” implies that the event is considered to be “associated with the use of the drug” 
meaning that there is “a reasonable possibility” that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33249] (ie, there are facts, evidence, or a rguments to suggest possible causation). 
8.2.2 Severity or Intensity  
The guidelines outlined in CTCAE v5.0 will be used for assessing the severity or intensity of the event. The general guidelines for assessing the AE grade are provided in Table 8 .

until end of study follow-up or 3 months (approx imately 5 half-lives) following the last dose of 
IP in case of early withdrawal (Section 8.3). 
Participants who become pregnant during the study period must not receive additional doses of 
IP but will not be withdrawn from the study. If the participant requests to know which treatment 
she received, this information will be provided  to her. The pregnancy will be followed for 
outcome of the mother and child (including any premature terminations) and should be reported to the Sponsor after outcome. 
Should the Investigator become aware of a pregnancy in the partner of a male study participant 
who has received IP, this should be reported to Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event, by [CONTACT_789952] (refer to Section 8.[ADDRESS_1088196] 
information). The Sponsor will endeavor to collect follow-up information on such pregnancies, provided the partner of the study participant provides consent for disclosure of their information. 
8.2.4 Overdose or Misuse  
Any instance of overdose of IP (suspected or confirmed) must be communicated to Sponsor 
(Section 8.3). Any associated AEs or SAEs must also be reported and their management should 
be recorded.

categorical data, percent and frequency will be re ported. Data listings will be sorted by [CONTACT_789953]. Details of the statisti cal analysis will be specified in a separate 
SAP. 
9.2 Statistical Hypothesis  
The following are the statistical hypotheses a ssociated with the primary efficacy outcome 
measure (proportion of participants achieving BICLA response + OGC ≤ 7.5 mg/day and 
≤ Baseline (Day 1) prednisone or equivalent dose at Week 48).  
x Null hypothesis (H0): Difference in proportion of responders (VIB7734 versus 
placebo) = 0. 
x Alternative hypothesis (Ha): Difference in proportion of responders (VIB7734 versus placebo) ≠ 0. 
9.3 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size was calculated based on the primary efficacy outcome measure. Assuming a placebo response rate of 20%, [ADDRESS_1088198] 80% 
power to detect an increase in response of 20% in a VIB7734 group as compared to the placebo group at the 2-sided alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_1088199]. The minimum detectable 
difference is 13% between the 2 treatment groups. The assumption of a 20% responder rate for 
placebo is based upon published results ( Furie et al, 2017 ). 
9.4 Analysis Sets  
Full Analysis Set:  The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participants who receive 
any dose of IP in the study. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment randomized. The efficacy analysis will be based on the Full Analysis Set. 
Safety Analysis Set:  The Safety Analysis Set will include all participants who received any dose 
of IP in the study. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment that they received. 
Safety, PD, and analyses will be based on the Safety Analysis Set. 
PK Analysis Set:  The PK Analysis Set will include all participants who receive any dose of 
VIB7734 in the study and have at least one qua ntifiable serum PK observation post-first dose. 
Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment that they received. The PK analysis will be based on the PK Analysis Set.

group and placebo group. 
The proportion of participants achieving BICLA response + OGC ≤ 7.5 mg/day and ≤ Baseline 
(Day 1) dose prednisone or equivalent at Week 48 in the VIB7734 treatment group will be compared to that of the placebo group using a logistic regression model with treatment, 
Randomization stratification factors, and Baseline  IFN inducible gene signature [CONTACT_789964]. The difference in proportion of re sponders of VIB7734 versus placebo will be 
estimated together with its associated 90% CI. 
A sensitivity analysis with the same model will be performed using a treatment policy strategy to 
address intercurrent events defi ned above. All observed values will be used regardless of 
occurrence of an intercurrent event. 
9.5.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures

 APPENDIX 1 NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE 
AND FOOD AND ALLERGY ANAPHYLAXIS NETWORK 
GUIDANCE FOR ANAPHYLAXIS DIAGNOSIS  
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and Food and Allergy Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death ( Sampson et al, 2006 ). They recognize 3 categories of anaphylaxis, with criteria 
designated to capture from 80% of cases (Categor y 1) to > 95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for 
all 3 categories). 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hi ves, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-
uvula), AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: 
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_4806] [PEF], hypoxemia). 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence). 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula). 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia). 
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symp toms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence). 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting). 
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Infants and children ─ low systolic blood pressure (age specific) or greater than 30% 
decrease in systolic blood pressure. 
b. Adults ─ systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg or greater than 30% decrease 
from that participant ’s baseline.

10 4.0 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background and Rationale  
Although prison and jail can be effective at reducing levels of crime and drug use during the period 
of inca rceration , resumption of these behaviors upon release is the norm. Nearly 7 in 10 released 
offenders are re -arrested within three years (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2002 ; Pew Center on 
the States, 2011 ). Data regarding drug use are even more disquieting, indicating that in many 
cases offenders are re -addicted within one month of relea se from incarceration ( Bird & 
Hutchinson, 2003; Kinlock et al., 2011 ) and their drug use and/or crime levels following prison can 
even exceed use levels prior to incarceration ( Hough, 2002 ).  
 
Not surprisingly, such persistent patterns of drug use and crim e are associated with comorbid 
health problems and even premature death. I n a given year, a quarter of all people in the United 
States who have HIV, a third who have HCV infection, and more than 40% who have tuberculosis 
disease will pass through a correctional facility that same year ( Bergier et al., 2010; Hammett et 
al., 2002).  Likewise, t he risk of death among parolees during the first two weeks following release 
from prison  is nearly 13 times greater than those of similar demographic background —with drug 
overdose being the leading cause (Binswanger et al., 2007). As dire as this finding is, it may be 
an underestimate of the problem. A study of newly released prisoners in England and Wales 
found that mortality rates among males were [ADDRESS_441326] two weeks of release. Female offenders’ mortality rates were 69 times higher  (Farrell & 
Marsden, 2007). These studies are included in a  recent meta -analysis of drug -related deaths 
following prison release that revealed a three - to eight -fold increase in the risk of drug -related 
deaths during the first two weeks following release (relative to the subsequent 10 weeks), with 
relatively high risk of death remaining throughout the first month of reentry (Merrall et a l., 2010) . 
These authors concluded that “further research is urgently  needed  on mortality after release from 
prison, as well as interventions to reduce the risk of drug -related deaths during the transition from 
prison to the community”  (pp. 1552 -1553).  
 
A substantial body of research now exists supporting the safety and efficacy of naltrexone and 
buprenorphine , in both their oral, daily -dose forms and in depot long -acting formulations  (e.g., 
Chiang et al. 2003; Krupi[INVESTIGATOR_9729]., 2011; Ling & Wesson, 2003; Ling et al., 2010; Lobmaier et 
al., 2010; Mattick et al., 2008 ; Mello & Mendelson, 1980). Nonetheless, MAT, particularly 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_354274], has not been readily adopted in correctional settings. 
A survey of correctional agencies (conduc ted as part of NIDA’s CJ -DATS collaborative) revealed 
that two -thirds of the jails surveyed provided methadone (primarily for detoxification), but none  
offered naltrexone to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] -dependent inmates (Friedmann et al., 2012). Although the use of 
MAT is more  common in jails than in prisons (used primarily to manage opi[INVESTIGATOR_2533]), it is 
important to note that MAT remains unavailable in most jails for purposes beyond detoxification  
(Oser et al., 2009).  
 
The efficacy of naltrexone has been well established . Naltrexone, an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2634], 
blocks the euphoric effects of heroin and other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  This characteristic  has fostered growing 
acceptance of naltrexone by [CONTACT_354327] (Farabee, 2006).  However, it must be taken orally on 
a daily basis , making adherence a problem among all but the most committed patients . Cornish 
et al. (1997) randomly assigned federal probationers to a 6 -month program of probation plus 
naltrexone and brief drug counseling or to probation plus counseling alone and found that opi[INVESTIGATOR_354275] , with  the mean percent of opi[INVESTIGATOR_354276] 1.0  
                                                                                                                                      Dec 2  2013   
 
 
11 tests among the naltrexone subjects at 8%, versus 30% for control subjects ( p < .05). Likewise 
56% of the controls and 26% of the naltrexone group ( p <. 05) had their probation status revoked 
within the [ADDRESS_441327] udy period and were returned to prison . But treatment compliance was a 
problem, with only 52% of subjects in the naltrexone group continuing for the 6 -months duration 
of the study .  
 
Still, the effectiveness of oral naltrexone is mitigated by [CONTACT_354328] -world settings. In one study of a prison -based naltrexone program, only 7% of the enrolled 
patients remained in treatment for six months (Shearer, Wodak, & Dolan, 2007). To address this 
issue, Vivitrol® (~380mg naltrex one delivered intramuscularly every four weeks; Alkermes, Inc.) 
was developed to provide long -acting pharmacotherapy  for one month per dose. The purpose of 
this proposed study is to assess the relative effects and net economic benefits of this 
pharmacother apy in comparison with a patient navigator (PN) and drug education (DE) conditions 
for criminal -justice -involved offenders.  
4.1.[ADDRESS_441328] called for expanding the use of medication -assisted treatment in prison 
(Cropsey et al., 2005; Kinlock et al., 2011), there are several features of jails that make the latter 
more promising settings for MAT. Perhaps the most critical difference is that detoxification 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_354277], not prisons. Virtually all prison  inmates spend time in local jails while 
awaiting trial or sentencing. Therefore, whether an offender is serving a brief jail sentence or is 
awaiting transfer to prison, detoxification typi[INVESTIGATOR_354278]. The second 
reason for f ocusing on jails relates to the time period of incarceration. Jails tend to house offenders 
for a few days to several months, wh ereas  prisons are reserved for those serving sentences for 
a year or more —on average 29 months (Kuziemko, 2007). As a result, the costs of maintaining 
prison inmates on naltrexone, buprenorphine, or methadone for the entire duration of their 
sentence would like ly be prohibitive. The third consideration is that more offenders pass through 
jails than prisons. This is an important point that is often missed: Although prisons house more 
inmates than jails at any one time (1,512,576 in prison versus 780,581 in jail a t year -end 2007 
[BJS, 2008a]), the number of entrants  to these two systems tells a very different story, with 
751,593 admissions to prison during 2007 versus approximately 13 million admissions to jails 
during that same period (BJS, 2008a,b). The increased  flow between jails and the community 
likely accounts for reports that the availability of drugs in jails exceeds that in prisons.    
 
A recent survey of criminal justice agencies affiliated with NIDA’s Criminal Justice Drug Abuse 
Treatment Studies (CJ -DATS) collaborative found that MAT is underutilized in the treatment of 
substance use disorders (Friedmann et al.,  2012 ). Offenders most likely to receive MAT were 
pregnant women and those experiencing withdrawal. Offenders least  likely to receive MAT were 
those re -entering the community after serving a prison or jail term. Among the primary factors 
influencing the use of MAT in these correctional settings were preferences for drug -free treatment 
and limited knowledge of the benefits of MAT. Addressing these p hilosophical - and knowledge -
related barriers requires relevant research, specifically, data collected in real -world settings 
testing practical MAT administration models on offender populations. It is also important to note 
that even if philosophical barrie rs shift in favor of MAT, tight local and state budgets may require 
a higher threshold of evidence —particularly related to costs —before allowing a wider adoption of 
MAT for offenders.  
 
IIPOD   Version 1.[ADDRESS_441329] of managing 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561], preventing relapse to drug use, and concomitantly resulting in reduced 
HIV/AIDS infection by [CONTACT_354329] -related behaviors that promote tr ansmission of HIV 
(Metzger, Woody, & O’Brien, 2010; Morris, Levine, & Weaver, 2004; WHO, 2004).  This aspect is 
especially pertinent among the criminal justice population, where the prevalence of confirmed 
AIDS is more than double that of the general U.S. population (Maruschack, 2009). Effective MAT  
also provide s an opportunity to educate about unsafe sexual activities and to reduce HIV -risky 
sexual activities such as having concurrent /multiple sexual partners, especially in overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_354279] y increase HIV infection liability (Copenhaver et al., 2006; Morris, 1997; Morris 
& Kretzschmar, 1997). Research has documented significant reductions in HIV risk behavior and 
overdose deaths and improved outcomes from antiretroviral treatment in HIV -infec ted opi[INVESTIGATOR_354280] (Johnson et al., 2000).  
 
Naltrexone offers an approach  to combat the spread of HIV predicated on  its opi[INVESTIGATOR_354281], in contrast to the full or partial agonists (methadone or buprenorp hine). 
Vivitrol may be especially useful where cultural and regulatory conditions inhibit use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_354282], because of perceived “coddling ” of addicts. As promising as 
this long-acting pharmacothera py may be , however it is unlikely to be widely adopted by 
[CONTACT_354330].  
4.[ADDRESS_441330] among 
correctional populations. A recent study compared depot naltrexone with methadone among 
heroin -dependent inmates released from prison and found that both pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_354283] (Lobmaier et al., 2010). However, 
post-release retention in the methadone condition was extremely low (relative to the 100% 
adherence rate for those i n the depot naltrexone group). Poor attendance/adherence is a vexing 
issue in offender treatment, with typi[INVESTIGATOR_354284]-third to one -half of parolees 
referred to drug -free counseling programs, and about half of those referred to MAT (Corni sh et 
al., 1997; Lobmaier et al., 2010; Olson, Rozan, & Powers, 2009). Vivitrol potentially obviate s the 
problem of non -compliance with medication dosing, eliminate s concerns about potential diversion  
as medication is provided once monthly by [CONTACT_44686] s tudy team , and lessen s the need for 
frequent patient presentation in the clinic or primary care physician's office —issues that are 
concerns associated with oral naltrexone .  
 
The development of long -acting depot formulations of naltrexone  (e.g., Vivitrol)  has also provided 
a new approach for treating opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827], especially in terms of preventing relapse once 
abstinence has been attained (Comer et al., 2006). Naltrexone implants reliably prevented relapse 
within one month after detoxification (Foster, Brewer, Steele, 2003), and multi -site research in 
Russia found Vivitrol effective for treating heroin addiction over six months (Krupi[INVESTIGATOR_9729]., 2011). 
Vivitrol was approved in [ADDRESS_441331] intends to provide new empi[INVESTIGATOR_354285] a 
correctional population on the utility of depot naltrexone in preventing relapse and associated 
behaviors  by [CONTACT_354331] -acting medication in a context that takes advantage of its 
strengths to bring about positive and meaningful net economic benefits. Comparisons will be 
made between two medication conditions provided with and without a Patient Navigator 
component (VI, PNV) and a drug education (DE) condition.  
4.[ADDRESS_441332] emphasizes evaluation of the clinical utility of pharmacotherapy with Vivitrol (VI) or 
Vivitrol + PN  (PNV)  in comparison to a drug education (DE) condition. D escriptive statistics will 
provide an overall assessment of the implementation of the protocol.  The aims  of this project 
include:  
 
Aim 1 : Assess the feasibility a nd clinical utility of a 24 -week  protocol of long -acting naltrexone 
(by [CONTACT_80626] ; VI) provided with and without a PN component (VI, PNV) . Measures 
include side effects, adverse events, retention , and acceptance of the procedures by [CONTACT_354332].  Acceptance will also be assessed among correctional staff.   
Aim 2 : Examine the effectiveness of Vivitrol provided with  and without a PN  component (VI, PNV) 
for its ability to prevent relapse to illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441],  reduce drug -related criminal activity, curtail 
engagement in HIV-risk behaviors , and increase employment compared to a group receiving only 
drug education (DE) to assist in relapse prevention after release from jail. The VI and PNV groups 
will receive VI monthly for the entire 6 -month intervention phase. Th PNV group wil l be provided 
with PN  for 3 months to provide ass istance in accessing  community treatment after release fro m 
jail. Primary m easures include DSM -5 diagnosis at time to relapse (defined as self -report of daily

4.3.2  Secondary Objectives  
Secondary objectives include:  (1) HIV risk behaviors ( compared using repeated measures 
procedures to evaluate possible change in sexual and drug -related behaviors that may inhibit or 
promote HIV infection ) measured by [CONTACT_305728] -GAIN; (2) Self -reported number of days incarcerated 
during the intervention and follow -up phases; (3) Self -reported number of days of opi[INVESTIGATOR_354287], and objective measures of drug use by [CONTACT_297826] (UDS) 
at the [ADDRESS_441334] -release assessment (end of the intervention phase); (4) Self -reported days 
in drug abuse treatment; (5) Self -reported number o f arrests; (6) Self -reported craving for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , 
and (7)  Self -reported number of overdoses .  
IIPOD   Version 1.[ADDRESS_441335] medical management. Before discharge  from jail , participants randomized to 
one of two medication conditions (VI, PNV) receive Vivitrol  and subsequent  injections every four 
weeks for 24 weeks . Those in the PNV condition will meet with a PN  before discharge and 
regularly after release to discuss barriers to treatment, possible treatment program participation 
following release, and will address social support and other participant needs . Before discharge, 
the Drug Education (DE) group will participate in session(s) designed to provide a presentation 
and discussion of drug -related issues. Followi ng release from jail, all participan ts will receive 
phone calls from the study team to facilitate scheduling of appointments to occur twice monthly 
for the first [ADDRESS_441336] study 
participants to assess well-being and adverse events.   
5.2 Duration of Study and Clinic Visit Schedule  
The duration of this study will include a projected 2-4 weeks for sc reening/baseline assessments 
and medication induction, and a 24 -week intervention phase to include, specific to assigned 
condition, medication , PN, DE, assessments, and medical management . The screening phase 
will differ in the length of time needed to com plete eligibility assessments, random assignment, 
and to complete medication induction  in the VI and PNV condition s. Induction will be scheduled 
to occur within 4 weeks  of discharge. Screening  assessments will include the collection of 
laboratory samples a nd medical assessments  to ensure participant safety . Confirmation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d-
free status (UDS  and naloxone challenge) before medication  induction will take approximate ly 
two hours. Assessment visits at 1, 3, 6, 7, and [ADDRESS_441337] from 20 –[ADDRESS_441338] : 
1. Be at least [ADDRESS_441339] not : 
1.    Have a medical ( e.g., liver failure, congestive heart failure) or psychiatric condition (e.g., 
suicidal ideation, psychosis) that would make participation unsafe in the judgment of the 
medical staff or the PI , 
2.    H ave current or chronic pain or have plans to undergo pain treatment/therapy , 
3.    Have known sensit ivity to naltrexone or naloxone,   
4.    Have participated in an investigational drug study within the past 30 days prior to 
screening , 
5.    Be a nursing or pregnant female, or not agree to use a medically acceptable form of 
birth control such as oral contraceptives, barrier (diaphragm or condom), levonorgestrel 
implant, intra -uterine progesterone contraceptives system, medroxyprogesterone 
acetate contraceptive injection, or complete abstinence. Females who become pregnant 
during the course of the study will be withdrawn from the study and, if requested, will be 
provided with referrals for drug  treatment and/or medical care,  
6.    Have any pendi ng legal action that could prohibit continued participation for the [ADDRESS_441340] a current pattern of alcohol, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or other depressan t or sedative 
hypnotic use, as determined by [CONTACT_354333].  
5.4 Participant Recruitment  
Recruitment through a close collaboration with the Bernalillo County  Metropolitan Detention 
Center  (BCMDC ) staff,  combined with IRB -approved presentations and posted announcements 
in the jail facilities will proceed until [ADDRESS_441341] ed that an 
average of 6 -8 individuals will be randomized per month across the 20 -month enrollment period. 
Based on prior evidence in sim ilar trials, refusals and early (pre -randomization) dropouts will 
account for approximately 20% of individuals presentin g for screening.  
Recruitment plans include hypervigilence to the issue of voluntariness. All BCMDC  and study staff 
will be extensively trained on this issue to ensure that their actions and words do not convey any 
level of coercion. Training will include a discussion of the fact that treatment  and study compliance 
are optimized when participants have the opportunity to consider the study, ask questions, and 
provide voluntary consent to participate. Furthermore, all recruitment documents and the ICF will 
emphasize that decisions whether or not to participate are solely up to the individuals, that the 
decision will not affect the treatment or possible treatment to which the individual is eligible, that 
participation/non -participation will not affect the sente nce, release, probation, or any other aspect 
of the individual ’s incarceration.    
 
The main method of recruitment will be announcements of the study made to inmates in  the 
Bernalillo County  Metropolitan Detention Center  (BCMDC ). An informational flyer will be provided 
to arrestees who are within [ADDRESS_441342] on a participant’s sentence, jail term, probation, 
parole, or release.  
 Treatment procedures for jail inmates : Offenders are detoxified (if necessary) under physician 
supervision within the jail setting . After this, they are moved to the general inmate population but 
have follow -up visits with t he jail physicians. While in custody, the y may opt to pursue participation 
in available onsite  treatment programs .   
Prior to release , a case  worker from Inmate Services  meets with the inmate and may make  a 
referral to a community -based program, which can be either drug -free residential or outpatient, 
depending on inmates ’ needs and preferences.  Show -up rates in the community tend to be quite 
low, but transportation directly from the jail to treatment program s has resulted in improved 
admission rates.  
5.5 Study  Sites  
UCLA Integrated Substance Abuse Program (ISAP).  The leadership, data management, and 
analysis portions of the proposed project will occur at UCLA ISAP  in Los Angeles.  
 
Walter Ling, MD, will be the physician PI [INVESTIGATOR_72188]. He has extensive experience in both the 
use of Vivitrol and behavioral treatments.  He will be involved in supervision of the medical aspects 
of this study, randomization, and will meet regularly wit h other study personnel. He has conducted 
over a dozen clinical trials using MAT  and will be responsible for medical team traini ng. More 
recently, he has conducted research using Vivitrol and has been instrumental in the training of 
other ISAP medical pers onnel on the Vivitrol injection.  
 
For this project, the primary sites for recruitment, data collection, and treatment services are the 
Bernalillo County Metropolitan Detention Center and the University of New Mexico , Department of 
Psychiatry.  
 
Bernalillo C ounty  Metropolitan Detention Center (BC MDC) . Recruitment and inductio n will occur 
at the jail sites i n the BCMDC  System. The  jail fa cility houses sentenced and unsentenced 
inmates. The types of inmates housed here are general population, violent/assaultive  offenders, 
psychiatric, and inmates needing medical services.  This facility is staffed with Sheriff Service 
Technicians, intake and release specialists, medical service staff  contracted by [CONTACT_354334] , and clerical support staf f.  Bernalillo County opened the MDC 
facility in 2003.  Currently, the MDC averages about 40,000 bookings per year, with an average 
daily population of 2,636. Males account for 87% of the inmate population.  With regard to 
race/ethnicity, 54% are Hispanic, 2 3% White -Non-Hispanic, 12% American Indian, 9% African - 
American, 0.4% Asian, and 1.7% are categorized as “Other.”  Currently the MDC detoxifies an 
average of 758 individuals monthly —412 from alcohol and 346 from opi[INVESTIGATOR_858].  
 
The University of New Mexico Addi ction Substance Abuse Program (ASAP), The University of 
New Mexico Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse, and Addictions (CASAA); These programs 
will be the  location s for post-release assessment and medical management v isits. ASAP and 
CASAA offer a range o f treatment services designed to help individuals copi[INVESTIGATOR_354288]. Services include screening, crisis intervention, individual, group, and family 
counseling, HIV /Hep  education, assessment, and evaluation, referrals to community -based 
services, and outreach to the community. Outpatient treatment programs providing psychosocial 
interventions are located throughout the county. In the community, the MATS program provides 
comprehensive detoxification, treatment, and transitional housing servi ces for medically indigent

All participant s will voluntarily sign an informed consent prior to study  participation. The informed 
conse nt process involves a detailed verbal description of the study and the data collection 
procedures. The participant will be encouraged to ask questions about the study procedures 
throughout the process. The risks of participating in this study will be detai led in the consent form. 
Staff will emphasize that participation is voluntary and that participants may withdraw consent at 
any time without prejudice , and will be given referrals to other local treatment programs .  
 
After discussing the study procedures , potential risks and benefits, the voluntary nature of study 
participation, and that participation will have no effect on a participant’s sentence, jail term, 
probation, parole, or release, study candidates  will an swer a brief quiz  to verify and document a 
thorough understanding of the research prior to signing the consent form. The study candidate  
will sign the consent form a s witnessed by  a study investigator or physician. Research staff will 
receive extensive training in the informed consent process. A co py of the signed consent form will 
be given to all  participant s 
7.2 Screening  
The study team  will provide a basic description of the study to interested individuals who respond 
to IRB -approved flyers and announcements at BCMDC . Study staff will verify pre-eligibility status 
of each study candidate with jail staff (e.g., has completed opi[INVESTIGATOR_9734], jail term and 
expected release date).  Individuals determined as pre -eligible will be scheduled for a 
consent/screening appointment. Screening will be gin with the informed consent process . A 
complete medical history and physical exam will occur after consent. Participants will be  
randomized to study condition  when results of all assessments, including blood chemistries and 
ECG, are obtained and eligibil ity is confirmed. Screening will take ~ 4 hours, excluding  review of 
lab results. This process may occur over multiple days.  
7.3 Random Assignment  
Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to study condition (VI, PNV, DE ) in a 1:1:1 strategy 
using a n urn randomization procedure (Stout et al., 1994) to provide multivariate balance across 
two characteristics correlated with outcomes in addiction treatment trials: type of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (heroin or 
prescription drug) and gender.  
 
Individuals who terminate partic ipation before induction onto the assign ed medication (or similar 
time-point for behavioral assignments) will be replaced.  Those terminating after VI induction or 
provision of the first DE session  will not be replaced a nd will be counted a s "treatment fail ures" 
(in an intent -to-treat scenario).  
IIPOD   Version 1.[ADDRESS_441346] 7 days before receiving the Vivitrol injection, which is confi rmed via self -report and facility 
records. To ensure opi[INVESTIGATOR_354290], a naloxone challenge will occur followed 
by [CONTACT_354337], adhering to NIDA -approved and IRB -
approved procedures . Subsequent  Vivitrol injections administered every four weeks will require 
confirmation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_354291], as determined appropriate and necessary by [CONTACT_354338]/or Nurse 
Practitioner (NOTE: In New Mexico, a Nurse Practitioner [NP] has virtually all the same medical 
privileges as a Physician and can function as an Physician) .  
 
The pre -induction strategy includes:  
• Step 1.  Participants must self -report no clin ically significant opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (i.e., at any level 
that could constitute a potential risk of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_354292]) in the previous s even days.  
• Step 2.  A urine drug screen will be administered shortly  before the naloxone ch allenge 
and must be negative for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Individuals who are opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -negative will continue in the 
pre-induction process. Individuals may have an additional urine drug screen on a 
subsequent day if the study medical clinician determi nes that a second screen is 
appropriate.  
• Step 3.  Completion of all pertinent psychosocial and medical screening and eligibility 
assessments.  
• Step 4.  Absence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_27262] a urine screen is not absolute proof that a patient is entirely 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -free; As such a naloxone challenge will be administered.  Prior to subsequent 
Vivitrol injections every four weeks , the naloxone challenge can be performed at the 
discretion of the study physician to ensure continued suitability for the Vivitrol injection . An 
example of a naloxone challenge procedure may begin with I.V., I.M., or subcutaneous 
delivery of 0.1mg naloxone. If  no significant opi[INVESTIGATOR_354293] a 
few minutes, a seco nd dose of 0. 3mg would then be administered followed by a brief  
observation  period.  With no observed  discomfort,  0.8mg naloxone would then be  
administered  as the final dose,  followed by a n observation period . A minimum 0.8mg bolus 
must be given before determining th e outcome of  the challenge. An alternative is to 
challenge with a single 0.8mg bolus. The determination as to whether the participant is 
eligible to continue on to VI induction will be made by [CONTACT_354339], including both objective and subjec tive assessments.  Attention to 
individual symptoms and symptom changes should guide determination of eligibility . Signs 
of discomfort or an increase in withdrawal symptoms following naloxone administration 
should be taken as a positive result of the challe nge, with  induction delayed until a 
negative challenge result is achieved.  
Participants who experience withdrawal symptoms following the naloxone challenge can be 
treated with ancillary medications  if appropriate , observed until symptoms resolve, and given  the 
oppor tunity to be re -challenged  on a future date . Participants who are not interested in continuing 
to participate, or who fail a repeat naloxone challenge, will not be eligi ble to participate .

21 7.5 Pharmacotherapy  
7.5.1  Extended -release Naltrexone ( VI) 
Depot N altrexone as Vivitrol. Vivitrol  is a combination of naltrexone -containing microspher es that 
are delivered by  [CONTACT_354340]. Plasma concentrations 
of naltrexone and 6 -beta naltrexol (its main metabolite) after a single Vivitrol injection are 
detectable for at least [ADDRESS_441347] common AE has been 
reaction at the injection site, reporte d in 50% of the placebo group and 69% of the 380mg Vivitrol 
group Physician’s Desk Reference  (PDR). The most common gastrointestinal AEs are nausea 
(11% in placebo group; 33% in Vivitrol group) and vomiting (6% in placebo group; 14% in Vivitrol 
group). For pain management in an emergency situation, regional anesthesia or non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_354294].  
 
Extended -release Naltrexone  (VI) will b e provided to participants as a gluteal intramuscular 
injection (380  mg) administered every four weeks . The VI injection shall be administered following 
the guidelines  provided in the package insert, includ ing the  pre-induction procedures described  
above.  
Well-developed precautionary procedures  will be followed to avoid adverse events associated 
with induction. For example, body habitus will be assessed during the  physical exam at  screening 
to assure that needle length is adequate for intramuscular administration  as a n inadvertent 
subcutaneous i njection of VI may increase the likelihood of injection site reactions. The needle 
provided in the VI package  is a customized needle  required for injection of medication . Individuals  
whose body habitus precludes a gluteal intramuscular injection of naltrex one using  the requir ed 
needle  will be excluded from the study . 
7.6 Behavioral Treatment  
7.6.1  Drug Education (DE)  
This condition is intended as an enhanced treatment -as-usual condit ion. Enhancements will 
include  standardized materials for drug education and overdose prevention education.  
7.6.2  Patient Navigators (PN)  
In addition to receiving Vivitrol, participants in the PNV condition will be assigned a Patient 
Navigat or (PN). A PN  provides one -on-one assistance to su rmount barriers to entry and 
adherence with medical care for chronic disease. Originally designed to improve outcomes in 
oncology for disadvantaged female patients, the PN conceptual foundation is a strengths -based 
case management perspective to help patie nts keep their appointments (through scheduling, 
reminders, and accompanying the patients), improve communication between the patient and 
their providers, offer health education, provide assistance with personal barriers to treatment (e.g., 
transportation,  health insurance, childcare), and offer emotional support. Clinical trials have found 
that PN increased cancer screening and follow -up rates, improved entry and adherence to HIV 
treatment, and increased adherence to medical appointments and greater likeli hood of achieving 
an undetectable viral load compared to controls.   
 
Addictions treatment studies have also found positive outcomes in randomized trials for services 
comparable to PN to increase the likelihood of treatment entry from: a central drug treatm ent 
intake;  receiving medical care at a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307];  and community outreach.  Although a case

22 management approach was not found effective in linking drug users newly -released from prison  
to community treatment,  that study ’s sample was heterogeneous in terms of its drug use (only 
10% were opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent) and did not receive pharmacotherapy. PN has not been studied in 
re-entry into the community with treatment initiated in jail. It is our hypothesis that PN has the 
potentia l to assist newly -released detainees to overcome barriers to successful community 
treatment entry.  
 
In this study, the Patient Navigator (PN) will meet with PN participants to discuss barriers to 
treatment, facilitate referrals to community outpatient beh avioral drug abuse treatment, and 
provide assistance with other social support -related needs.  
7.7 Study Team Training  
Research staff will be  certified in good clinical practices and will continue to receive regular 
boosters in clinical research procedures, in cluding protection of privacy and well -being of human 
research participants.    
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_9769] /Nurse Practitioner and other  clinical personnel will receive training in 
the medication procedures (i.e., preparation for the Vivitrol injection and its administration). The 
Study Physician will provide on -site training at BCMDC  and BCMDC  clinical staff may also travel 
to UCLA to observe medication procedures.   
7.8 Medical Management  
At each clinic visit,  participants  will meet with study physicians and o ther study personnel such as 
nurses, research assistants, and counselors, to  review urine results, discuss adverse events, 
consider the study medication effects and side effects, and discuss other pertinent issues  in 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_354295] . Participants’ engagement in self -help groups such as 12 -
step is permitted.  Medical Management visits will occur twice -monthly during months 1 -3, and 
monthly during months 4 -6, and Vivitrol injections will be provided monthly to participants in the 
VI and P NV conditions.  
7.9 "Rescue" Protocol  
Participants who develop significant problems, who cannot tolerate naltrexone, or whose pre -
existing condition worsens during the study may r eceive increased levels of care  deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_38234] , and they will be referred to other treatment resources.  
7.[ADDRESS_441348] with naltrexone will be excluded or withdrawn based on clinical judgment.  
 
Management of Study Medications  
Appropriately qualified and trained medical personnel  will maintain an accurate and current 
accounting of all study medication,  which will be available for ve rification by [CONTACT_111238] s. Drug -
accountability records including perpetual inventory, will include the amount  of study medication 
ordered, received,  transferred between areas of the study  site, and those dispensed to individual 
participant s.  
7.12.1  Study Medication Storage  
Study medication will be stored in compliance with federal, state, and local laws and institutional 
policy.  Study medicat ion will be stored  in a locked, secure, limited -access location under the 
conditions spe cified by [CONTACT_9883]; Vivitrol  will be stored in a locked refrigerator .  
7.12.2  Unused Medication  
Unused  expi[INVESTIGATOR_354296] a n inventory of unused medication, and all 
medications not used by [CONTACT_354341] (or as directed) for destruction. Unused medications will be accurately labeled, securely 
stored, and kept separate ly until sent for destruction . Damaged, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697], or u nused study 
medication will be accounted for by [CONTACT_354342]. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_354297].

24  Participants will be withdrawn from medication if it is clinically determined that continuation may 
be unsafe. For example, participants who develop uncontrolled hypertension will be discontinued 
and instructed to see their private physician, or will be provided with referrals for medical care. 
Women who are assigned to one of the VI conditions and become pregnant during the intervention  
period will be withdrawn from study medication, referred for medical care, and the pregnancy will 
be followed until an outcome is known. Participants who experience intolerable side effects or 
other physical or psychiatric conditions regardless of relationship to the study medication will also 
be withdrawn from further study medicati on administration.  
The medical clinician  may determine that a participant’s clinical condition has deteriorated during  
the course of the study.  Examples of clinical deterioration  that might trigger a decision to withdraw 
the participant from medication  include the following:  
• The initiation or recurrence of risky behaviors that make further participation 
unsafe;  
• Overdose;  
• Emergence of psychosis, suicidal ideation,  severe cognitive impairment or 
dangerous criminal behaviors;  
• Evidence of general medical deterioration; or  
• New onset of psychiatric or medical conditions that would require intervention  that 
would preclude continued participation in the study protocol.  
In the event the participant is withdrawn from further medicatio n administration, referrals to 
treatment programs or recommendations for medical care will be provided. The study medical 
clinician, in collaboration with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_354298]. At any  time, participants may decide that they no longer wish to continue

                                                                                                                                      Dec 2  2013   
 
 
26 8.1.2  Physical Examination  
A physical examination  will be completed at screening to ensure that the re are no exclusionary 
medical conditions  and to gather baseline information. An examination of the participant’s body 
habitus will address appropriateness for VI gluteal intramuscular injection.    
8.1.3  Injection Site Examination  
Appropriate medical personnel will examine the injection site on the visit following each injection 
procedures. Additional monitoring may be required. Participants will be asked to immediately 
report any site reactions to allow evaluation, monitoring, and possible referral, as needed. 
Injection site examinations will be documented.  
8.1.4  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A 12-lead ECG will be administered  at screening.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_441354] 
urinalysis will help determine  eligibility at screening . An accredited laboratory (College of 
American Pathologists or equivalent), that meets CLIA guidelines, will provide lab results, normal 
values, and proof of lab certifications.

self-reports of birth control method(s).  
8.1.8  Vital Signs  
Vital signs  (e.g., body temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]) will be collected  at 
screening, at each medical management visit throughout the intervention phase, before and after 
naloxone administration , at Vivitrol  injections.   
8.1.6  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Information about prescription, over-the-counter medications, and herbal s upplements used by

other medical management visits, the form will document  medications taken since the previous 
data collection visit.  
8.1.7  Adverse Events (AEs)  and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
Medical or psychiatric adverse events (AEs) will be collected  by [CONTACT_354345] : “How 
have you been feeling since you r last visit?” A Es will be recorded at ea ch visit after consent 
according to the adverse even t reporting definitions and procedures. If a  reported AE suggests 
medical or psychological deterioration, it will be brought to the attention of the study medical 
clinician for further evaluation, and seizures will also be reported to the DSMB as they occu r. 
SAEs will be medically managed , reported, and followed in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements.

27 8.2 Drug Use Measures and Psychological Measures  
8.2.1  Substance Use Report: Timeline Follow -Back (TLFB)  
The TLFB will be used to elicit participant s’ self-reported use of alcohol and illicit substances . At 
screening, substance  use reported by [CONTACT_354346] [ADDRESS_441358] -
medic ation visit, and at follow -up to document the participant’s self -reported use of substances 
for each day since the previous assessment . 
8.2.2  Urine Drug Screen (UDS)  
Urine samples  will be collected at every clinic visit using FDA -approved one -step temperature -
controlled urin e drug test cups following all of the manufacturer's recommended procedures. The 
UDS will test for the presence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], oxycodone, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cocaine, 
amphetamines, MA, marijuana, methadone, and Ecstasy (MDMA).  A validi ty check may be 
performed using a commercially available adulterant test strip that indicates normal ranges for 
creatinine, pH (at minimum), nitrate, glutaraldehyde, specific gravity, bleach and pyridinium 
chloromate.  Study staff may observe the collection  of UDS. In the event of suspected tampering, 
the study team will request a second sample and may observe  the urine collection  process 
according to clinic standard operating procedures . 
8.2.3  Visual Analog Craving Scale (VAS)  
Participants’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_354299] a visual analog  scale (VAS)  that ranges from 
0 (no craving) to 100 (most intense craving possible).  The VAS  will be completed  at screening 
and at each Medical Management and assessment visit .  
8.2.[ADDRESS_441359] /Modified CIDI  
The DSM -5 Checklis t is a semi -structured interviewer administered instrument that provides 
current diagnoses for substance use disorders bas ed on DSM -5 diagnostic criteria. The CIDI will 
be modified for use in this study. Either/both measures  will be completed at screening  to 
deter mine presence and severity of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], and at [ADDRESS_441360] records will be accessed to compi[INVESTIGATOR_354300]’ arrests, convictions, 
sentences, and incarcerations.  
8.3.2  CJ-DATS Crime Grid  
Criminal Justice history will be documented including information about criminal activity, arrests, 
convictions, and incarcerations with this 24 -item section of the CJ -DATS intake instrument.  
IIPOD   Version 1.0  
                                                                                                                                      Dec 2  2013   
 
 
28 8.4 Data Collection and Management   
Study measures will be collected using electronic data e ntry, and managed by  [CONTACT_354347]’s Data 
Management Center (DMC) to manage large amounts of data. This process performs range 
checks and other verification procedures during and immediately after completion of data entry, 
thus ensuring the reliability of de -identified data transmitte d to our DMC via a secure server at the 
end of each day. Upon study completion, each participant’s data record is saved to disk  and 
securely stored.  
8.[ADDRESS_441361] will comply with NIH regulations regarding provision of access to the data set (in non -
identifiable form) after study completion. As approved by [CONTACT_978], the ISAP DMC will respond to 
requests for data. Articles from the project will be made available via submittal to PubMedCentral 
after publication.  
 
 
IIPOD   Version 1.[ADDRESS_441362]  training (e.g., Good Clinical Practices), as well as protocol -specific 
training as needed (e.g., assessments, study interventions, fidelity to the pro tocol and safety 
procedures, data management and collection, research procedures including understanding 
reliability and validity, and problem solving). Study Medical staff will be trained on all aspects of 
medication induction and delivery.  
IIPOD   Version 1.[ADDRESS_441363] emphasizes evaluation of the clinical util ity of Vivitrol in jail inmates as compared with 
a Drug Education condition (DE) , while descriptive statistics will provide an overall assessment of 
the implementation of the protocol.  
 
Analyse s will include an Intent -to-treat (ITT) design such that all randomized participants who 
received at least one dose of medication (VI, PNV), or received at least one session of drug 
education (DE) will be included who did not violate the protocol in a way that could potentially 
affect the efficacy results.  Participants will be excluded from the Protocol Population (PP) if:  
1. concomitant medication that is known to have significant clinical effect on primary or 
secondary endpoints was administered.  
2. Violations  of the inclusion or exclusion criteria are judged to affect the efficacy 
evaluations.  
Subjects in the PP population will be allocated to treatment  groups in the analysi s based on the 
actual treatment they received . If there is substantial difference betwe en the ITT population and 
the PP population, all analyses described below will be performed using only subjects in this 
group.  
 
All statistical tests will be performed using two -sided .05  significance level s, unless otherwise 
stated.  All comparisons betwee n treatments will be reported with  parameter estimates and  95% 
confidence intervals .  For parameters measured at baseline and subsequently, the variables of 
interest are changes from baseline.  
 
Post-baseline variables will not be imputed; estimates can be  obtained using the hierarchical 
models specified below under the assumption of missing at random. For the primary outcome 
measure, diagnosis at six months, subjects who have dropped out for whatever reason will be 
considered to retain the diagnosis. Other  outcome measures for which data are missing will be 
imputed using multiple imputation methods. Sensitivity analyses will repeat specific analyses 
using permutation tests of at least 1000 samples.  
10.1 Primary O utcome

10.2     Secondary O utcomes  
 
Analyses will include descriptive, b inomial and multinomial  methods to address secondary 
outcomes:  
 
(1) HIV risk behaviors ( compared using repeated measures procedures to evaluate possible 
change in sexual and drug -related behaviors that may inhibit or promote HIV infection ) 
measured by [CONTACT_305728] -GAIN;  
 
(2) Self-reported number of days incarcerated during the intervention and follow -up phases;  
 
(3) Self-reported numbe r of days of opi[INVESTIGATOR_354289], and

10.[ADDRESS_441365] that a baseline sample of 150 participants with 50 
participants per condition will yield a final aggregate sample of approximately 120 participants, 
assuming 10 -20% dropout. (Our similar studies hav e had 85 -90% follow -up rates.) Thus, a final 
evaluable sample size of [ADDRESS_441366] size 
(~.60) between conditions for some of the outcome variables (at ~.70 power) and .[ADDRESS_441367] size 
(at .80 power) for ot hers. For example, we expect that the measure “time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]” will 
be markedly different  among the three groups, given the difference given the expected relapse 
among the no -medication group. Over time, the total number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -free urine resu lts is 
expected be greater among the VI participants, who are likely to show less dropout and better 
long-term retention compared to the DE group. Our selection of the effect size is based on effects 
found in the literature for Vivitrol when compared again st placebo, and is consistent with both 
Cohen (1988) and with more recent guidance; for example, Lipsey and Wilson (1993) did a meta 
analysis of [ADDRESS_441368] 
size was .5, adding suppo rt to Cohen's recommendation that selection of the effect size of .5 is 
appropriate (Bausell & Li, 2002) .    
 
10.4 Analysis Approach  
 
Analyse s will employ  modeling approaches that are less sensitive to biases from missing data, 
using a technique that conceptualizes missing data in two ways: intermittent missing data for 
participants active in the trial and dropouts (Shoptaw et al., 2002). Analysis of urine drug screen 
results are conducted using aggregates such as the Treatment Effectiveness Score (Ling et al., 
1997) , which is tested by [CONTACT_354348] -parametric strategies, where appropriate. 
Retention differences between conditions will be test ed using an appropriate survival analysis 
model. Counts and composites of scores on drug craving and psychological measures will also 
be analyzed by [CONTACT_354349] t -tests and ANOVAs. Secondary analyses may include 
use of longitudinal models (Di ggle et al., 1994), including normal mixed -effects models (Littell et 
al., 1996; SAS Institute, 1996; Singer, 1998; MIXED; PROC MIXED, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) 
for continuous measures and generalized linear mixed models (Littell et al., 1996; GLMM; 
GLIMMIX macro, SAS Institute, Inc) for categorical measures. A six -step analysis approach is 
described below.   
IIPOD   Version 1.0  
                                                                                                                                      Dec 2  2013

10.4.1  Data Screening  
 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_354301]; univariate analyses will determine cell 
frequencies, normality, linearity, a nd homoscedasticity of continuous variables, and missing 
values. Variables with non -normal distributions will be transformed, when appropriate, using 
procedures recommended by [CONTACT_354350] (1977). Missing values will be handled using 
conventional ca se elimination, mean substitution, or estimation procedures (e.g. Cohen & Cohen, 
1983). Preliminary analyses will address baseline characteristics of the two medication conditions 
using univariate techniques to determine the adequacy of the random assignme nt procedures, 
and whether these procedures result in groups similar in pertinent characteristics. Any variables 
determined to differ significantly between conditions will be used as covariates. We will also 
conduct attrition analyses to determine whether participants who failed post-consent screening 
differ from those randomized.  
 
Baseline Characteristics and Treatment Group Differences  
To appraise differences in baseline characteristics of the treatment groups, continuous variables 
will utilize  analysis of variance, ordinal variables will utilize  the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test , and 
dichotomous variables will utilize the chi -square (χ2) test or Barnard’s test.  As appropriate, 
transformation such as log, square root or inverse may be utilized to accomplish the twin goals of 
variance stabilization across levels of the predictor variables and normal distribution of the 
outcome variable, if necessary.  
For continuous variables, the number of non -missing and missing values and the median, mean, 
standar d deviation, minimum, and maximum will be obtained for each treatment group.  For 
categorical variables, the counts and proportions of each value will be tabulated.   
Differences between participan ts who were consider ed but not randomized (screen fails ) will be 
compared with randomized participants on  selected demographic characteristics. Summary 
tables for continuous variables include mean, standard deviation, median, min and max will be 
prepared. Outcome measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_354351].  
Treatment group differences at the 0.[ADDRESS_441369] Primary Outcome Measure  
 
A  mixed effects logistic regression will used to model the binary  primary  outcome measure;  the 
diagnosis of opi[INVESTIGATOR_354302]. are modeled as a linear 
combination of predictor variables . A logit link function  will be used  to link subject  covariates to 
the probability of success There will be two levels in the model: within sites and between sites. 
The model will included treatment , cluster (site) and baseline covariates as fixed effects  and 
subject  as a random effect.  Indicator variables will identify whether a subject has received XR -
NTX, methadone and a behavioral intervention (PN.) Site by [CONTACT_354352]. I nteractions that are statistically significant at the 10% level will be 
investigated and may imply that  analyses  of individual sites is required. In this case,  relevant 
contrasts  will be performed within the sites.  
 
Additional covariates will include age, gender, whether a subject  had prior methadone 
maintenance treatment  and baseline self-reported cocaine use . Other possibilities mediating  
IIPOD   Version 1.0  
                                                                                                                                      Dec 2  2013   
 
 
33 factors include opi[INVESTIGATOR_74518], concurrent cocaine or alcohol and/or 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_74500], and homelessness .   
 
SAS P ROC  Mixed will be  used  to perform the analysis. The coefficients in the model will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_354353] (GLS), with covariance parameters estimated by 
[CONTACT_79363] (REML).  Standard errors of the parameter estimates will be 
computed using the model. This procedure a ssumes that missing observations are ignorably 
missing or missing at random (MAR).   
The primary contrast is a comparison of the probability of a  DSM -5 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_354303] 6 months  for those on medication versus those receiving enhanced treatm ent as 
usual (etau.) The contrast will utilize XR NTX  data from both the NYU and UCLA and  Interim 
Methadone data from FRI; the medication plus  PN treatment arm will not be included.   
 
Descriptive statistics will examine feasibility issues of the pharmacoth erapy, analyzing AEs, side 
effects, and patient and clinician acceptance, and reasons for early termination or post -
randomization refusal of assigned condition. Single -point, between -group comparisons of these 
measures can be tested using t -tests or ANOVAs  for continuous variables and chi -square for 
binary measures.  
 
10.4.3  Economic Analysis (Aim 3)  
The costs of the Vivitrol will be estimated using the Drug Abuse Treatm ent Cost Analysis Program 
(DATCAP [d1]; French, 2003b ). The DATCAP is a data collection instrument and interview guide 
designed to estimate the costs of substance abuse treatment and related interventions. Because 
the DATCAP organizes cost data across standard categories of resources (e.g., personnel, 
buildings and facilities, supplies and materials, and miscellaneous), it can be used for other types 
of interventions including pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Cost data will be obtained  to calculate the total 
annual cost of Vivitrol and the average per -client cost. We will not include any costs specific  to 
research conducted under this  study. To ascertain the full economic impact of Vivitrol , cost data 
will be compared to changes in key clinical measures of effectiveness (e.g., time to relapse, days 
of abstinence, re -arrest) to estimate cost -effectiveness ratios. Cost -effectiveness analysis ( CEA) 
is inherently an incremental analysis that compares doing a little more or a little less of something 
to capture marginal variations in costs and effectiveness across interventions (Gold  et al., 1996).  
Differences in program cost are divided by [CONTACT_354354]-effectiveness ratios  (ICERs) . One can then compare the ratios of cost to 
outcome for two or more alternative programs (in this ca se Vivitrol ) to determine which programs 
are relatively more cost -effective (i.e., have a lower cost -effectiveness ratio) .  The more expensive 
pharmacotherapy will be directly assessed to see if the additional cost generates greater 
effectiveness across th e key outcomes of interest. As an alternative approach to examining the 
full economic impact of this pharmacotherapy, we will estimate the economic benefits associated 
with reductions in criminal activity and criminal justice system  costs, improved employm ent, and 
reduced health care use . The difference between economic benefits and intervention costs 
represents the net economic benefits of the interventions. The primary objectives of the benefit 
analysis are to identify important economic outcomes for Vivitrol, convert these outcomes into 
dollar equivalents, and estimate the therapy’s  total and domain -specific economic benefits.  
Decreases in some measures between baseline and follow -up, such as number of arrests, 
represent improvement while other measures, such as hours worked, show  improvement with 
increases. Benefit -cost analysis ( BCA) expresses results as a benefit -cost ratio (benefit divided 
by [CONTACT_225437]) or a net benefit estimate (benefit minus cost) and considers an intervention cost -
beneficial if the benef it-cost ratio exceeds unity or if the net benefit estimate is positive.  In

UCLA and UNM  IRBs will approve all consent forms, recruitment materials, and any materials 
given to the participant. Annual  reports and progress repor ts will be submitted to the IRBs annually 
or as requested .  
11.3 Informed Consent  
All potential candidates for the study will be given a current local IRB-approved copy of the 
Informed Consent Form to read in En glish. Appropriately qualified and trained study personnel 
will explain all aspects of the study in lay language and answer all of the study candidate ’s 
questions. Participants who remain interested after receiving an explanation of the study will be 
given  a short  quiz to test his/her understanding  of the project, the  purpose and procedures  
involved , and the voluntary nature of  his/her  participation . Those who cannot successfully answer 
quiz items will have the study re -explained by [CONTACT_9872] a fo cus on aspects they did not 
understand. Anyone who cannot demonstrate appropriate understanding of the study will be 
ineligible to participate . Those who demonstrate understanding of the study and voluntarily agree 
to participate will be asked to sign the informed c onsent  form. Participants will not be administered 
any assessments or study procedures prior to signing informed c onsent.  
The informed consent process  is a means of providing study information to each prospective 
participant and allows for an in formed decision about participation in the study. The informed 
consent form must be updated or revised whenever important new safety information is available, 
or whenever the protocol is amended in a way that may affect a study participant ’s consideration 
for participation in the trial . Every study participant will be given a copy of the signed consent form  
to keep for reference . Individuals who refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study will be 
treated without prejudice.  
11.[ADDRESS_441372] (DSMB)  
This study will utilize a DSMB to oversee ongoing trial progress. The purpose of this board is to 
determine whether risks emerge during the conduct of the trial that make continuation unethical 
(e.g., clear and significant superiority of one condition over another). This process is intended to  
assure t he IRBs, the sponsor, and investigators  that participants are provided with an acc urate 
and ongoing risk eval uation when participating in  research trials. Safety monitoring begins with 
the initial review of the protocol during the study development process.  Reports of participant 
serious adverse events (SAE) will be provided to the DSMB  as they occur.  The DSMB will meet  
as necessary over the study duration .  
11.7 Medical Monitor  
A Medical Safety Monitor will be  responsible for overseeing safety and for evaluating all Adverse 
Events (AEs). He/She will review all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) w ithin five days  of their 
occurrence and all other Adverse Events on a regular basis. It is the responsibili ty of the Principal 
Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_354304]. It is also the Principal 
Investigators’  responsibility to  inform the IRB of any reportable AE/SAE.

reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstru ction of the clinical research study. 
The original recording of an observation should be retained as the source document . 
11.21  Protocol Deviations, Violations,  and Reporting and Management  
Any departure from procedures and requirements outlined in the protocol  will be classified as 
either a protocol deviation or protocol violation . The difference between a protocol deviation and 
violation has to do with the seriousness of the event and the corrective action required. A protocol 
deviation is considered an action  (or inaction) that by [CONTACT_354360], rights, or welfare of a study 
participant. Protocol violations are departures that may compromise the participant safety, 
participant rights, inclusion/exclusion criteria or the integrity of study data and could be cause for 
corrective actions if not rectified or prevented from re -occurrence. Protocol violations  will be 
monitored for (1) significance, (2) frequency, and (3) imp act on the study objectives, to ensure 
that performance does not compromise the integrity of the trial.  
Additionally, the study team  is responsible for  report ing Protocol Violations to the  IRB as required.  
11.22  Safety Monitoring  
11.22.1  Adverse Events (AEs)  
In accorda nce with FDA reporting requirements, all AEs occurring during the course of the clinical 
trial will be collected, documented, and reported by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_11637] -investigators 
according to the specific instructions detailed in this section of  the protocol and Appendix A.  The 
occurrence of AEs will be assessed at each study visit starting at the time that informed consent 
is signed through the post -medication assessment, and study staff will follow -up on the status of 
any AEs that remain at th e post -medication assessment.  
 
An AE is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of 
the clinical trial, whether or not the event is considered investigational product -related or clinically 
significant . For this  study, AEs will include events reported by [CONTACT_2299] , as well as clinically 
significant abnormal findings on physical examination or laboratory evaluation. A new illness, 
symptom, sign or clinically significant clinical laboratory abnormality or wor sening of a pre -existing 
condition or abnormality is considered an AE. Stable chronic conditions, such as arthritis, which 
are present prior to clinical trial entry and do not worsen are not considered AEs.  All AEs must 
be recorded on the AE Form. The AE Form is also used to record follow -up information for 
unresolved events reported on previous visits.  
 
Each week, a study physician or investigator must review the AE Form completed for the previous 
week for any events that were reported as continuing. All AEs, including clinically significant 
abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed by [CONTACT_354361].  
 
A Medical Clinician  will review or provide consultation for each serious event as needed. These 
reviews will include an assessment of the  severity and causality to the study drug or study 
procedures.  The Medical  Clinician will also provide advice for decisions to exclude, refer, or 
withdraw participants as required. The medical mo nitor will determine which safety events require 
expedited reporting to the IRBs, NIDA, the DSMB , and other regulatory authorities  as appropriate .

the responsibility of promptly reporting all SAEs to NIDA.   
Adverse Events  
For the purpose of this study, the following AE will not require reporting in the data system but will 
be captured in the source documentation as medically indicated:  
 Grade 1 (mild) unrelated adverse events  
This would typi[INVESTIGATOR_9792], cold, etc ., that were 
considered not reasonably associated with the use of the study drug/intervention.  
Other  adverse events that are deemed moderate, severe or serious, regardless of the relationship 
to the study medications, will be captured and reported in the data system.  
Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be documented in the source documentation as medic ally indicated  and reported 
through the data system.

been associated with oral doses of 1400 to 2100 mg per week. Recent study findings show that 
no evidence of liver toxicity was found in those receiving monthly  Vivitrol® injections such as 
provided in this study . Participants will not be allowed to participate if there is any indication or 
report of acute symptomatic hepat itis or liver failure .  
 
Vivitrol® injections may be followed by [CONTACT_77368], tenderness, induration, swelling, redness, bruising, 
or itching. Injection site reactions have been the most common adverse events associated with 
Vivitrol®, but the injection site will  be monitored after each injections. Any participant exhibiting 
adverse events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_354362] a surgeon if 
warranted.  Other side effects may include nausea and vomiting. Continued use of naltrexone is 
not associated with tolerance or addiction, but naltrexone will precipi[INVESTIGATOR_354305] a 
person who is physiologically dependent on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  To eliminate this risk, a naloxone challenge 
will be administered to each participant in this condition bef ore administration of each Vivitrol 
injection.

report, and monitor adverse events.  
 
Definition of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in humans, whether or not 
considere d study drug/intervention related, which occurs during th e conduct of a clinical trial. Any 
change from a baseline pre-existing condition based on clinical status, ECGs, lab results , x-rays, 
physical examinations, etc., that is considered clinically signif icant by [CONTACT_354367].   
Suspected adverse reaction  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study drug/intervention caused the adverse event. A reasonable possibility implies that there 
is evidence that the study drug/intervention caused the event.  
Adverse reaction  is any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_5257]/intervention.  
An adverse event, suspected adverse reaction, or adverse reaction  is considered “ serious ” 
(i.e. a serious adverse event, serious suspected adverse reaction or serious adverse reaction) if, 
in the view of either the study medical clinician or sponsor, it:  
1. Results in death: A death occurring during the study or which comes to t he attention of 
the study staff during the protocol -defined follow -up period , whether or not considered 
caused by [CONTACT_5257]/intervention , must be reported.  
2. Is life -threatening : Life-threatening means that the study participant was, in th e opi[INVESTIGATOR_354322], at immedia te risk of death from the reaction as it occurred 
and r equired immediate intervention.   
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] .  
4. Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the abilit y to 
conduct normal life functions .  
5. Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect . 
6. Important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes, but may 
jeopardize the health of the study participant or require medical or surgical intervention t o 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious event.   
 
Definition of Expectedness  
Any adverse event  is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or the 
package insert or is not listed at the specifi city or severity that has been observed . If neither is 
available then the protocol and consent are used to determine an unexpected adverse event.  
 
Pregnancy  
Any pregnancies that occur to a participant enrolled in the study will be captured on a pregnancy 
CRF and not separately reported as an AE or SAE.  Women who become pregnant during the 
IIPOD   Version 1.[ADDRESS_441390] AEs. Adverse events (medical and/or psychiatric) 
assessment will initiate with participant consent and follow -up will cont inue through [ADDRESS_441391] study visit. Medical personnel  will obtain as much information as possible about the report ed 
AE/SAE to complete the AE/SAE forms and wi ll consult  as warranted.  
Standard reporting, within 7 days of the site becoming aware of  the event, is required for 
reportable AEs. Expedited reporting (within 24 hours of their occurrence and/or site's knowledge 
of the event) is required for reportable SAEs (including death and life -threatening events).  Local 
sites are responsible for report ing SAEs to their IRB, per their IRB’s guidelines.  
Sites are required to enter reportable AEs and SAEs in the EDC system. The AE form is used to 
capture reportable A Es (as defined in the protocol). Additional information may need to  be 
gathered to evaluate  serious  adverse events and to complete the appropriate CRFs and the 
summary . This process may include obtaining hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9837], medical records, 
autopsy records or any other type records or information necessary to provide a complete and 
clear  pi[INVESTIGATOR_354323]. If the SAE is not 
resolved or stable  at the time of the initial report  or if new information becomes available  after the 
initial report,  follow -up information must be submitted as soon as possible.  
Reportable adverse events  will be followed until resolution , stabilization or study end. A ny serious 
adverse reactions will be followed until resolution or stabilization even beyond the end of the 
study.  
 
Assessing Severity and Causality  of Adverse Events  
Appropriately q ualified and trained medical personnel will conduct an initial assessment of 
seriousness, severity, and causality when eliciting participant reporting of adverse events.  A 
study medical clinician will  review reportable AEs for seriousness, severity, and causality on at 
least a weekly basis.  
Guidelines for Assessing Severity  
The severity of an adverse event refers to the intensity of the event.  
Grade 1  Mild Transient or mild discomfort (< 48 hours), no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266772] 
(non-prescription or single -use prescription therapy may be 
employed to relieve symptoms, e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_9840], acetaminophen for post -surgical pain)

needed; no or minimal intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].  
Grade 3  Severe  Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/ therapy required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].  
Guidelines for Determining Causality  
The study medical clinician  will use the following question when assessing causality of an adverse 
event to study drug/intervention where an affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected 
adverse reaction:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the study drug/intervention caused the event?  
 
Monitoring Adverse Events  
Local quality assurance m onitors  will review  study sites and respective  study data on a regular 
basis an d will promptly advise sites to report any previously unreported safety issues and ensure 
that the reportable safety -related events are being followed to resolution and reported 
appropriately. Staff education, re -training or appropriate corrective action p lan will be 
implemented at the participating site when unreported or unidentified reportable AEs or serious 
events  are discovered, to ensure future identification and timely reporting by [CONTACT_779].  
 
Safety Management Procedures of AEs/SAEs

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer mortality in the United 
States with approximately 180,000 patients diagnosed each year.  Systemic disease and relapse 
after definitive therapy (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation) are common.  There is a need to 
develop new approaches for treating patients with NSCLC.  There is also a need to develop 
methods for predicting response to treatments, monitoring response to therapy, and early detection 
of relapse and/or systemic disease.  There is little known about the numbers, time course, and 
effect of therapy on CTCs in NSCLC patients.  The p rimary objective of this protocol is to describe 
the pattern of CTC detection in NSCLC patients undergoing definitive radiation therapy.  
Exploratory studies on the isolation of circulating tumor  DNA  (ctDNA)  and its contributory value 
to the collection of c irculating tumor cells will also be conducted.   Patients with NSCLC who 
undergo radiation as part of a definitive course of treatment will be enrolled. Blood collections 
will be obtained before, during , and after the completion of radiotherapy.   In patients who are also 
treated with the novel signal transduction inhibitor, nelfinavir, in addition to chemoradiotherapy, 
an additional blood sample will be obtained [ADDRESS_889928] demographic and treatment data and explore & describe the 
pattern of CTC detection in all patients.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
  
NSCLC  
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer mortality in the United 
States with approximately 180,000  patients diagnosed each year.  Systemic disease and relapse 
after definitive therapy (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation) are common.  There is a need to 
develop new approaches for treating patients with NSCLC.  There is also a need to develop 
methods fo r predicting response to treatments, monitoring response to therapy, and early detection 
of relapse and/or systemic disease.  There is little known about the numbers, time course, and 
effect of therapy on CTCs in NSCLC patients  (Katz et al., 2010)   
 
Current  Methods of Circulating Tumor Cells Detection and Inherent Limitations  
The absolute number of CTCs that have been reported from cancer patients has varied greatly from 
one study to another (Katz et al., 2010) . Technical constraints may lead to an underestim ation of 
CTCs in some studies.  Tumor cells can adopt a wide range of shapes and sizes that may be 
indistinguishable from or overlap with normal cells, including white blood cells.   CTC -detecting 
techniques based on morphology or size alone may therefore fail to isolate CTCs that mimic 
normal cells in size or shape. Such tumor cells however can be uncloaked by [CONTACT_660081] -
specific antigens, including cell surface markers. Expression levels of such markers may, however, 
vary substantially between CTC s of different histologies or even possibly within the cells from a 
single patient.  The specific CTC analysis technique employed, how the patient -derived materials 
are handled and stored, and the thresholds set for detection not to mention the patient’s d isease or 
treatment status may all potentially affect the sensitivity by [CONTACT_660082].  
 
Size exclusion filtration  is a common CTC detection technique based upon the observation that 
tumor cells are in general larger than non -cancerous circulating cells.  An advantage of this method 
 
CTC's and NSCLC  
Version Date: 4/2/[ADDRESS_889929] of epi[INVESTIGATOR_412261], unlike ot her technologies 
currently being investigated and it uses polycarbonate membrane filters which are relatively 
inexpensive.  However, a disadvantage is that the trach -etching process that is employed to create 
the filter pores can occasionally create two po res that overlap, resulting in larger cavities that allow 
all cells to pass through, including those that otherwise would not be able to pass through a single 
pore.  This in turn leads to CTC loss and thus decreased sensitivity.  
 
Density Gradient Separatio n Techniques  attempt to separate CTCs from peripheral blood cells 
based on their density.  The OncoQuick ® method (Greiner Bio -One, Frickenhausen, [LOCATION_013]) is 
one example of this technique.  This method relies on the fact that erythrocytes and neutrophils 
have greater densities than mononuclear cells and CTCs.  The method uses density gradient 
separation fluids such as Ficoll -Paque ®  or Percoll ® through which  erythrocytes and 
granulocytes will pellet while mononuclear cells and CTCs remain in the interph ase layer above 
the fluid and below the plasma (Fizazi et al., 2007) .    It is unclear, however, if all CTCs have the 
appropriate buoyan t density for capture via density gradient separation methods.  
 
Other techniques  have been described to distinguish CTCs from WBCs or to distinguish between 
subsets of CTCs expressing different biomarkers.  For example, laser scanning cytometry  is a 
techni que in which pre -stained cells are subject to laser light illumination and then scanned under 
microscopy to detect and count cells that stain brightly.   WBCs and CTCs are then differentially 
detected based on different degrees of light scatter, size, or o ther criteria (Pachmann et al., 2008) .  
Polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) is a sensitive method of detecting the expression of specific 
mRNA sequences, including those characteristic of CTCs.   However, there is often uncertainty 
regarding whether CTCs or WBCs or other sources are the origin of the detected mRNA, which 
thus confounds the analysis.  (Obermayr et al., 2010) .  Another method that relies on antibody -
based detection of epi[INVESTIGATOR_660073] (epi[INVESTIGATOR_660074]), in which live cells are incubated for [ADDRESS_889930] the binding of the primary  antibody to identify CTCs  
(Alix -Panabières et al., 2007) .  The CellSearch System (by [CONTACT_660083], so far the only method 
currently approve d by [CONTACT_660084]) relies on ferrofluid particles coated with anti -
EpCAM (EpCAM = Epi[INVESTIGATOR_660075]) antibodies to purify CTCs (Allard et al., 
2004) .  The ferroflui d particles coated with anti -EpCAM antibodies bind to CTCs, and the entire 
complex is then removed via magnets.  There may, however, be cellular components (debris) such 
as membranes retaining EpCAM that can be found freely circulating.   Consequently, the  
magnetically captured material is further assessed using a panel of markers to confirm the presence 
of cells of tumor origin.   These secondary markers include the DNA stain 4,6 -diamino -2-
phenylindole (DAPI), cytokeratins (CKs), and CD -45 (the latter two are detected via specific 
antibodies raised against the respective antigens).  The CellSearch System is heavily reliant on 
EpCAM expression.  Consequently there are many tumor types, especially those of non -epi[INVESTIGATOR_278691], which would not be detectable via this system.  Furthermore, it remains possible that loss 
of EpCAM, or lowered levels of expression such as that due to mutation or downregulation 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -to-mesenchymal transition), would likely impede the ability to isolate even cancer cells 
of ep ithelial origin.  The panel of secondary markers also requires regular validation and the 
 
CTC's and NSCLC  
Version Date: 4/2/[ADDRESS_889931] been published describing the detection of CTCs in NSCLC.  (Wu et 
al., 2009)  described a technique using depletion of CD45 cells from blood with magnetic beads 
followed by [INVESTIGATOR_243843]18/19 staining of enriched cells.  Rel atively few CTCs were detected although the 
number of CTCs correlated with stage. Katz reported on the development of a quantitative antigen -
independent fluorescent in situ  hybridization -based (FISH) method for detecting cytogenetically 
abnormal cells (CACs) in the peripheral blood of NSCLC patients (Katz et al., 2010) .  This FISH -
based assay detected losses and gains of selected chromosomal regions in the nuclei of cells 
regardless of their lineage.  These investigators detected mean number of CACs ranging from 7.23 
± 1.32/μL for deletions of 10q22.3/CEP10 to 45.52 ± 7.49/μL for deletions of 3p22.1/CEP3.   
 
Novel Methods of CTC Detection  
There is evidence that alternate techn iques of CTC detection, and in particular detection of viable 
tumor cells which have lost epi[INVESTIGATOR_13363], are possible. Kojima and colleagues have 
described one such method, in which a green fluorescent protein (GFP) -expressing attenuated 
adenovir us (OBP -401) is used to selectively label cells with high activity of telomerase. (Kojima 
et al., 2009) .This method is independent of cell -surface markers and therefore is independent of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_660076]. The Kojima method labels only those cells susceptible 
to adenovirus transduction and with high levels of telomerase activity. In the peripheral blood there 
exists a paucity of cells, oth er than CTC, in which adenovirus transduction may occur. 
Additionally, while it is established that telomerase is activated in the majority of human cancer 
cells, other circulating cells, including hematopoietic cells, show low telomerase activity. (Kojima 
et al., 2009) . This combination of factors makes this an ideal vector for the labeling and detection 
of CTCs.  
 
To our knowledge a telomerase -based method of CTC detection has yet to be applied 
systematically to a NSCLC cancer population. Our group, however, has experience in measuring 
CTCs from lung tumors as part of the tissue collection/registry study in the Department of 
Radiation Oncology, thereby [CONTACT_660085].  
 
Among  23 patients with non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing definitive 
chemoradiation the range of CTCs detected per m l of blood ranged from 0.57 to 570.7  cells (mean 
62.7, median 9.1, Standard Error 28.4 ). The rate of background, non -CTC cells, detected via the 
telomerase -based method in 4 normal, healthy controls ranged from 0.1 to 1.7 (mean 0.7 6, median 
0.72).  
 
Figure 2  shows the change in the number of CTCs detected among patients prior to and followi ng 
definitive chemoradiation for NSCLC. Patient #1 decreased from 56.9 CTC/ml prior to treatment 
to 0.9 CTC/ml following treatment. Patient #2 decreased from 9.1 to 1.8 and patient #3 from 1.2 
to 0.2. Percent decreases ( [pre-post/pre ]*100 ) for Patients 1 -3 were: 98%, 80% and 83%.

period in each patient. These data will be exploratory and hypothesis -generating.  
 
Isolation of Circulati ng T umor DN A (ctDNA)  
Circulating tumor DNA analysis may also be performed to provide additional correlated data. 
Following the isolation of the cells from the cell layer in the blood sample, the plasma from the 
rest of sample will be used to isolate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).   This DNA will then be 
amplified by [CONTACT_660086] (such as K -Ras, 
ALK, EGFR, etc), based on published methodologies (CAPP -Seq, Newman et al., Nature 
Medicine 20, 548 –554, 2014).

*Often a patient cannot be fully evaluated as a sur gical candidate until the completion of 
chemoradiotherapy.  This means that the patients originally placed in cohort 2 can be moved to 
cohort 5 and vice versa upon the discretion of the PI.  
 
Blood Collection Procedure   
 
The procedure of blood collection for each patient will be as follows: up to 5 mL of blood will be 
drawn into a waste tube (to avoid collecting skin material and potential contaminating skin stem 
cells.) The waste  tube will either be discarded or used to i nvestigate other laboratory methods 
involving CTC virus transduction.  This could lead to the use of a more effective virus for CTC 
analysis or the need for smaller subject blood samples in the future. Subsequently 10 mL of blood 
will be collected into hep arinized tubes, and immediately placed on ice in a prepared plastic bag 
and transported to the laboratory for processing within approximately one hour.   A 10 mL sample 
may also be collected (typi[INVESTIGATOR_660077] A tube) for the isolation of ct DNA.   These samples will 
be collected via venipuncture or by [CONTACT_14662] a patient ’s previously place central/peripheral line 
being used for other purposes (i.e. chemotherapy).      
 
The total volume of blood obtained with each collection  would therefore  ideally be at least 25 cc.  
Blood collections will, be obtained up to 2 times before  the start of radiation , during week s 1-2, 
week s 3-4, and week s 5-6 of radiotherapy or as clinically indicated.   Following the completion of 
radiotherapy blood draws will occur at approximately :  1 month, 3 months, 6 months,  12 months, 
18 months and 24 months.  In patients who are also treated with nelfinavir an additional blood 
sample will be obtained 4 -6 days after starting nelfinavir and prior to starting chemoradiotherapy.    
Blood collections are performed exclusively for research purposes.  
 
Ideal collection time points  generally  include:  
 
 A maximum of two pre -radiotherapy samples ( ideally within approximately 30  days of each 
other ) prior to the first fraction of radiation.  
 Approximately o ne to two  week s after the initiation of radiation therapy  (for cohort 7 this will 
be obtained during the course of stereotactic radiotherapy ) 
 Approximately t hree to four  weeks after the initiation of radiation therapy  (this c ollection is 
omitted for cohort 1 and 6 because the treatment course of those  cohort s is generally shorter 
than four weeks , for cohort 7 this will be obtained approximately three to four weeks after the 
initiation of concu rrent mediastinal chemoradiotherapy ) 
 Approximately  five to six weeks after the initiation of radiation therapy ( this collection is 
omitted for cohort 1 and 6 because the treatment course of those  cohort s is generally shorter 
than four weeks.  This collection may also be omitted for other cohorts if the in vestigator 
decides to use a hypofractionated treatment plan , for cohort 7 this will be obtained 
approximately five to six weeks after the initiation of concurrent mediastinal 
chemoradi otherapy ). 
 Approximately o ne month  after the completion of radiation

Due to unanticipated side -effects  of treatment, scheduling issues  or logistical difficulties, the 
above schedule will be modified at the discretion of the PI.   If a sample is unable to be obtained 
at a specified time point it will be collected at the next opportunity. Every attempt will be made 
to collect samples at normally scheduled standard of care appointments.   In cases where this is 
not possible and the p articipant is willing, a sample may be obtained at a research visit only.  
 
*cohort [ADDRESS_889935] an

(1) before start of Nelfinavir and before initiation of radiotherapy  
(2) after st art of Nelfinavir but before initiation of radiotherapy  
 
An additional  blood sample may be requested from the patient if he/she develops clinical or 
biopsy -proven recurrent disease  or progression of disease  at any time along with continued 
collection of sa mples at the same time points already determined per protocol .  
 
*Adverse events will not be followed or reported for this protocol.  
 
Off Study Criteria  
Patients will be taken off the study for 1) patient refusal ; 2) extraordinary medical circumstances  
or 3) at the discretion of the PI .

6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
6.1 Design:  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_660078] (CTC) can be detected in blood samples 
of patients with NSCLC undergoing definitive radiotherapy. CTCs will be detected by a method 
which uses a telomerase -specific replication -selective adeno virus expressing the molecular 
marker, GFP. Patients will be assigned to one of seven  strata, as defined by [CONTACT_453305]. A total 
of 280 patients will be enrolled,  10 in cohort 4 , 60 per stratum in cohorts 1,2, and 6  and 30 per 
stratum  in cohorts  3, 5,  7.  
 
Treatment Stratum  
1: Early stage NSCLC undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy  
2. Locally advanced NSCLC undergoing standard chemoradiotherapy  
3. Stage I to III NSCLC undergoing radiotherapy alone  
4. Locally advanced NSCLC undergoing Nelfinavir + standard chemoradiotherapy  
5. Stage IIIa NSCLC undergoing pre -operative chemoradiotherapy  
6. Non -biopsy proven early stage NSCLC undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy  
7. Locally advanced NSCLC undergoing stereotactic radiotherapy followed by 
[CONTACT_660087] . 
 
 
Up to two  blood samples will be obtained at baseline ( ideally within approximately 30 days of 
each other ). Thereafter, samples will be obtained at approximately weeks 1 /2, 3/4 and 5 /[ADDRESS_889937] express ion of relevant biomarkers detected in 
CTCs will be measured at baseline, at week 5 /6 during  radiotherapy and at 3 and 6 months after 
completion of radiotherapy.  Metabolic tumor response will be assessed by [CONTACT_10052]/CT when possible 
if performed as standard of  care at 3 months after completion of radiotherapy  and if clinically 
indicated . 
6.2 Objectives:   
 
6.2.1 The primary objectives are to determine:  
1.   intra- and inter -patient variability at baseline and test/re -test reliability of the method  
2.   the pattern of CTCs before, during and after definitive radiotherapy for each treatment stratum  
 
6.2.2 Secondary objectives are to describe the relationship between:  
3.  baseline CTC and metabolic tumor response  
4. change s in CTC  counts  during treatment (i.e., slope from baseline to week 5 /6 during  
radiotherapy) and metabolic tumor response  
5.  changes in CTC  counts  during treatment and changes after radiotherapy  
6. CTCs and the isolation of ct DNA

 And the pattern:

8. of genetic mutations and other biomarkers in the detected  CTCs before, during and after 
definitive radiotherapy  
9.  in patients receiving Nelfinavir  
 
6.3 Preliminary data:  
CTCs were measured in 23 NSCLC patients undergoing definitive  therapy. Substantial inter -
patient variation was observed, with a coefficient of variation of 212%.  Thus estimation of intra -
patient variation and inter -patient variation at baseline in a prospectively identified patient cohort 
will be extremely importan t, in order to identify credible treatment -related changes in CTCs during 
and after radiotherapy.

6.4 Endpoints:   
1. Circulating tumor cells will be detected by [CONTACT_660089] (GFP) which 
measures cells which high levels of telomerase activity  after adenovirus transduction. CTCs are 
measured in units of number of GFP-positive cells /mL.  
2. Meta bolic tumor response will be determined by [CONTACT_10052]/CT  (when performed as clinically 
indicated)  at [ADDRESS_889938] -treatment and dichotomized as responder (CR/PR) or nonresponder 
(<PR).  
3. Change in CTC will be measured by [CONTACT_660090] (post/pre) and percent chan ge from baseline 
(i.e., [pre -post)/pre]*100).  
4. EGFR mutations will be detected by [CONTACT_660091] -specific antibodies.  
5.  The presence or expression of other biomarkers and p athway s involved in tumor biology will 
be assessed via such meth ods as  RT-PCR for genetic mutations.  
6.    In patients treated with Nelfinavir, the levels of and changes in signaling pathways and other 
relevant biomarkers will also be assessed.  
 
6.5 Plans for Data Analysis:   
Descriptive statistics will support hypothesis generation and the design of adequately powered 
future studies. Most analyses will be conducted separately for each treatment stratum.  
 
Descriptive statistics/Graphs:  Baseline CTC will be characterized by [CONTACT_660092] (e.g., 
mean, median, SD, range, coefficient of variation) and reliability analysis (see below description). 
At each time point during and after radiotherapy, the CTC mean +SE and the fold change  mean +SE 
(to account for each patient's bas eline) will be calculated. Plots of mean and fold change over time 
will be generated. Test/re -test reliability analysis.  Since repeated observations of CTC are obtained 
at baseline, a plot of Visit 1 and Visit 2 values will be constructed, Pearson correlat ion and linear 
regression (i.e., test of slope = 1) will be initial analyses to characterize overall test/re -test 
reliability for the study population, pooling over the [ADDRESS_889939] -re/test reliability will be further 
evaluated by [CONTACT_25902] -patient coef ficient of variation. Defining real change.  To determine 
whether fold changes observed during and after treatment are beyond random variation, we will 
compute the ratio of Visit [ADDRESS_889940] deviation of 
 
CTC's and NSCLC

 the d istribution of the ratios. Values of fold change in CTC during and after treatment which fall 
outside the interval [1.0 -2SD, 1.0+2SD] will be considered credible changes.   
 
Repeated measures ANOVA and linear models:  Because we hypothesize CTCs will decreas e 
during radiotherapy, changes over time will be characterized by [CONTACT_660093]. Log 
transformation and pi[INVESTIGATOR_660079], as needed. Repeated measures 
ANOVA will be used to compare mean CTC values at each time point during and afte r 
radiotherapy to mean CTC at baseline, although these exploratory analyses may be underpowered. 
Group comparisons:  At [ADDRESS_889941] of stratum (#2 vs #4) while modeling the time 
course of CTC values. Similarly, the affect of standard radiotherapy versus stereotactic 
radiotherapy will be evaluated by [CONTACT_660094] (#1 
vs Stage I patients in #3). Correlations:  Relationships between CTC and biomarker  expression  or 
presence of genetic mutations  will be eval uated at fixed time points, by [CONTACT_660095]. Time courses of CTC, EGFR mutations and biomarkers will also be jointly plotted to 
investigate temporal relationships.  
 
Sample Size:   A total of 10 subjects will be enrolled in cohort 4 , 30 subjects  will be enrolled into 
cohorts 3, 5, & 7 and 60 subjects will be enrolled into cohorts 1, 2,  & 6. Any subject who does not 
complete a full course of radiotherapy will be removed from the study and replaced.

Open -Label Extension:  
On Day 29 (Visit 7) subjects who complete Visit 7, continue to meet the en try criteria , have no 
clinically significant AEs or tolerability issues and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_118154] -grow ing scalp hair will be eligible to enter a 12-month open -label extension.    In 
the open -label extension, safety, tolerability and efficacy will be assessed.  All subjects enrolled in the 
open -label extension will apply ATI -[ZIP_CODE] Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198], 0.46% to the entire scalp, twice daily for 
52 weeks ( 12 months).  In addition, sub jects with eyebrow loss may apply a thin film of study 
medication to the affected eyebrow(s) twice -daily for 52 weeks ( 12 months).  Subjects will be followed  
for safety, tolerability and efficacy as detailed in Section 7.3.  Subjects who decline  or are not eligible 
for the open -label extension should be seen for the Visit 1 6 (Post -treatment) assessments 30 days 
following the Day 28 (Visit 6). The duration of the open -label extension (OLE) should be based on the 
date of the visit that the subject initiated OLE treatment rather than the days from Baseline (Visit 2).  
For subjects who entered the open -label extension and had a gap between Visit [ADDRESS_131985] s (planned):  
12 subjects will be enrolled into the study.

investigational study drug or device occurred within 30 days or 5 half -lives (whichever is longer) 
of Screening (Visit 1) .  Subjects who have participated in a study of an investigational drug, 
device or biolo gic agent for alopecia areata (AA, AU or AT) within 1 year of screening will be 
eligible to participate only with individual permission from the Medical Monitor.  
17. Sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study medications.  
18. History of or current alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years of assessment for study enrollment.  
19. Screening ECG findings of:

Duration of Treatment  
Double -blind Treatment  
Screening period up to 30 days.   
Double -blind treatment  period is  29 days (maximum of 28 days of study medication  application ).   
Post-treatment Visit 1 6 is up to 33 days ( 30 +3 days)  following Day [ADDRESS_131991] s not continuing in to 
the open -label extension .   
Total study participation for subjects from Baseline  (Visi t 2) through  Post-treatment Visit 1 6(Day 59 + 
3 days)  is up to 62 days (29 + 33 ).  
Double -Blind + Open -Label Extension  
The duration of the total study participation from Baseline (Visit 2) to Week 56 (Visit 1 6) is anticipated 
to be a maximum of 400 days (393 + 7 da ys). 
The duration of the open -label extension (OLE) should be based on the date of the visit that the subject 
initiated OLE treatment rather than the days from Baseline (Visit 2).  For subjects who entered the 
open -label extension and had a gap between Visit 7 and entry into the open -label extension due to an 
administrativ e delay total study participation may be longer than 400 days.  
 
Endpoints

 INTRODUCTION  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_118163] -[ZIP_CODE]  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_118164] .  ATI -[ZIP_CODE] is a potent highly selective inhibitor of Janu s kinase 1 (JAK1) and Janus kin ase 
3 (JAK3).  
 
3.1. Summary  
Overview of Alopecia Areata  
 
Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune dermatologic condition , which , in its mildest form , is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_118165] -scarring hair loss on the scalp and/or body.  More severe 
forms of AA include total scalp hair loss, known as alopecia totalis (AT), and total loss of all the 
hair on the scalp and body - import antly, including loss of eyebrows, eyelashes, and intranasal hair - 
known as alopecia universalis (AU).  While spontaneous regrowth of hair is common in the milder 
form of AA (patchy), where the hair loss may wax and wane, in patients with the extensive hai r 
loss of AT or AU, spontaneous hair regrowth is rare.  AA affects both males and females across 
all ethnic groups and is a  prevalent autoimmune disease in the United State s, with a lifetime risk 
of 1.7%  (Safavi 1995) .  About two -thirds of affecte d individuals are 30 years old or younger at the 
time of disease onset.   
 
The course of AA is unpredictable and while up to 50% of patients may recover within [ADDRESS_132005] more than one epi[INVESTIGATOR_118166]  (Price 2008) .   Factors 
portending a poorer prognosis for regrowth are more extensive hair loss presentations (extensive 
AA, AT, AU), an ophiasis pattern of hair loss, a long duration of hair loss, a positive family history, 
the presence of other autoimmune disea ses, nail involvement, and young age of first onset  (Tosti 
2006, Weise 1996) .  In children, the disease may have a tendency towards worsening with time 
even if the initial presentation was mild , and the progressively disfiguring nature of the disease 
can b e psychologically devastating. AA is highly associated with numerous psychiatric 
comorbidities including adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders and depression in both children 
and adults, and an effective treatment for AT and AU, the more severe forms of the disease, 
represents a significant unmet medical need  (Bilgic 2014, Ruiz -Doblado 2003, Alkhalifah 2010) .  
 
The clinical development of innovative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_118167] -based  treatments for AA. A Cochrane database 
review highlighted that few therapi[INVESTIGATOR_118168] -based assessment s (Delamere, 2008 ).  This lack of good evidence -based 
data remains a challenge for physicians attempting to select efficacious treatments for their patients 
and, as a result, numerous approaches to treatment exist and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_118169], the extent and/or duration of the disease, patient expectations, cost 
considerations (both time and financial resources) and physician preferences and experience.  
 
Common treatments for the less severe (patchy) f orm of AA include corticosteroids, either 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_118170] i njected intralesionally into the alopecic areas, or the induction of an allergic 
reaction at the site of hair loss using a topi[INVESTIGATOR_118171] - an approach known as

 (DPCP), squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE), or treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_118174].   While these 
same treatment options may be utilized for the more severe forms of AA, their use  in the more 
severe forms of AA is limited not only due to limited efficacy, but also because of the 
impracticality of using them over extensive body surface areas.  Additional treatments used for 
extensive forms of AA (AT, AU) have included systemic stero ids (pulsed or chronically 
administered), immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine or methotrexate, phototherapy 
with psoralen +UVA (PUVA), narrow -band UVB, photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy 
(e.g., excimer laser, fractional photothermolysis la sers), prostaglandin analogs, etanercept, 
bexarotene and others, all with varying degrees of success and each with its inherent risk of adverse 
effects and unproven efficacy  (Alkhalifah 2010, Price 1999, Hordinsky 2015, Strober 2005) .  Most 
recently, howev er, a breakthrough in the understanding of the path ophysiology of AA  and several 
case reports in the literature have suggested that a group of inhibitors of the JAK -STAT pathway, 
the Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors, or “jakinibs” may be efficacious in the treatment of AA even 
in its most severe phenotypes, AT and  AU (Jabbari, 2015, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_77332], 2015, Xing 2014) .  
 
The JAKs are members of a family of tyrosine kinases that are involved in cytokine receptor 
signaling.  The JAK family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, Tyk2) plays an essential role in 
regulating the signaling process of most cytokines in cells by [CONTACT_118219] -induced 
signaling from the cell surface membrane receptors to signal transducers and activators of 
transcription, or STATs, within the cell s. Once these JAK receptors are activated by [CONTACT_118220] a cytokine to the appropriate receptor, they initiate a JAK -STAT signaling pathway which can 
modify gene expression and modulate important regulatory functions in the cell, including 
regulating im mune and inflammatory responses.  JAK1 and JAK3 are constitutively associated 
with the alpha chain and the common gamma chain (γc), respectively, of the receptors for 
interleukin -2 (IL2), interleukin -4 (IL -4), interleukin -7 (IL -7) interleukin -9 (IL -9), int erleukin -15 
(IL-15), and interleukin -21 (IL -21).  When these cytokines bind to their respective receptors, JAK1 
and JAK3 are activated and initiate a signaling cascade that drives key inflammatory events, 
including lymphocyte activation and proliferation. The JAK inhibitors can block the cytokine 
receptor signaling pathways, (in this instance JAK1 and JAK3) blocking JAK -STAT transcription 
activation, and can therefore modulate inflammatory or immune responses, which can be 
beneficial in a variety of disease  states, particularly, as recently reported, AA  (Xing 2014) .   In that 
report, pharmacologic inhibition of JAK kinase signaling (JAK -STAT signaling) was reported to 
promote hair growth in both genetic mouse models of alopecia and in human patient s. 
 
Immuno pathology & Pathophysiology of AA  
Alopecia areata (AA) results from an autoimmune attack on the hair follicles that results in 
growing anagen -phase terminal hairs being induced to prematurely enter the telo gen-phase and 
then shed.   In its most acute state,  AA demonstrates a histopathologically characteristic white cell 
infiltrate - the so called “swarm of bees” - encircling the human hair follicle , though more chronic 
forms typi[INVESTIGATOR_118175] a sparse r infiltrate  (Jabbari 2016, Whiting 2003) . Though the ex act 
autoantigens expressed in the perifollicular epi[INVESTIGATOR_118176] T -cells to infiltrate 
the normally immunologically privileged hair follicle have been previously unknown, the T -cells 
that home to the hair follicle have been demonstrate d to consist of both CD4 and CD8 cells.  Most 
recent studies have further characterized a specific subpopulation of activated NKG2D -bearing 
CD8 + T-cells as being prominent in the peribulbar infiltrate, and it is now currently felt that these 
CD8+NKG2D+ effector T -cells preferentially localize to dermal sheath cells aberrantly expressing

 high levels of MHC molecules and NKG2D ligands.  Interferons, as key activators of the MHC 
locus and of the cellular immune response, appear to play a key role in elimina ting the 
immunologic privilege of the hair follicle and in inducing and maintaining the pathologic 
inflammatory response in AA.  This is also seen in the C3H -HeJ mouse model of AA, in which 
IFN-γ is required for pathogenesis, and in which administration of  IFN-γ accelerate s disease. 
(Gilhar 2005, Hirota 2003).  
 
AA has been viewed as a Th1 -driven disease and, consistent with a pathogenic cellular immune 
response, elevated  Th1 cytokines/ chemokines (IFN -induced chemokines [IP -10/CXCL10]) are 
seen in the perip heral blood of AA patients and IFN -inducible gene signatures have been described 
in the skin of AA patients and may correlate with disease activity  (Arca 2004, Barahmani 2009, 
Kuwano 2007) .  Additionally, transcriptional profiles in human AA patients have shown a Type I 
IFN response in lesional biopsies and Th1 skewing and elevated IFN response 
cytokines/chemokines in both the peripheral blood and in reviewed scalp bio psies (Jabbari 2015, 
Xing 2014, Jabbari 2016).   The cellular source of IFN -γ is hypothesiz ed to be the T -cells, as in the 
AA mouse model IFN -gamma producing CD8+NKG2D+ cells dominate the de rmal HF infiltrate , 
and in human AA, IFN -γ producing cells were identified in 4 of 5 dermal crawl -out assays  
(Christiano 2016) .  Additionally, data  implicate  IL- 15 in driving activation of IFN -producing CD8 
T-cells (Xing 2014) .  
 
Thus, preclinical and preliminary clinical information, as discussed above, strongly suggests that 
the primary pathophysiologic mechanism in AA (including AT and AU) is a cytokine me diated 
(primarily through T -lymphocyte induced upregulation of IL -15 and IFN gamma) induction of and 
prolonged maintenance of the telogen stage of the hair cycle.  Inhibitors of the JAK/STAT 
pathway, particularly JAK1 and JAK3, are known to downregulate th e effects of both IFN -gamma 
(through the inhibition at JAK1), and IL -15 (through inhibition at both JAK1 and JAK 3), and 
several published case reports have demonstrated the potential for compounds that are JAK1/3 
inhibitors to induce hair g rowth in patien ts with AA (Kim 2017, Craiglow 2014, Craiglow 2017, 
Gupta 2016, Scheinberg 2016) .  As ATI -[ADDRESS_132006] satisfactory

4.1. Study Rationale  
Preclinical and preliminary clinical information, as discussed above, strongly suggests that the 
primary pathophysiologic mechani sm in AA (including AT and AU) is a cytokine -mediated 
(primarily through T -lymphocyte induced upregulation of IL -15 and IFN gamma) induction of and  
prolonged maintenance of the telogen stage of the hair cycle.   Inhibitors of the JAK/S TAT  
pathway , particula rly JAK1 and JAK3, are known to downregulate the effects of both IFN -gamma 
(through the inhibition at JAK1), and IL -15 (through inhibition at both JAK1 and JAK 3), and 
several published case reports have demonstrated the potential for compounds that are JA K1/3 
inhibitors to indu ce hair growth in patients with AA , AU and AT .  As ATI -[ZIP_CODE]  is a potent 
inhibitor at JAK 1 and JAK 3, it is s trongly suggested that ATI -[ZIP_CODE]  may be effective in the 
treatment of AA, AU and AT .   
 
The double -blind period of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerabili ty, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics  of ATI-[ZIP_CODE] Topi[INVESTIGATOR_118152], 0.46% compared to V ehicle Topi[INVESTIGATOR_118182] -daily for 28 days  in subjects with AU or AT .  On Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day

assessment of the scalp hair loss at Baseline (Visit 2) and Day 29  (Visit 7) by [CONTACT_118221].  Early signs of hair regrowth are expected to take a minimum of [ADDRESS_132008] 6 months or longer.  Data from SALT

and all were reported as mild severity except  for hypertensive urgency and worsening depression  
which were moderate in severity.    There were no serious treatment -related adverse events reported 
in the study.   One serious adverse event, worsening of depression , was reported in subject  01-005. 
The subject had a 48 -year history of depression and a  3-year history of bipolar disorder.  She was 
treated with electroconvulsive therapy and the event is o ngoing and assessed by [CONTACT_118223].  Levels of ATI -[ZIP_CODE] in the blood were all below the limit of 
quantification  (1 ng/mL)  at all timepoints  on Day [ADDRESS_132010] discontinued from the 
study ; both subject s withdrew consent .   
 
Early hair growth  (reductions in SALT scores)  is evident in 3 subjects who are currently on active 
treatment.  In order to  continue to assess response to treatment given the favorable safety to date, 
this amendment will allow subjects to continue with twice -daily active study medication 
applications up to 12 months.

The investigator will assign a unique five -digit subject identifier (SI) to each subject at Screening 
(Visit 1).  
 
The SI format will be NN -NNN, using leading zeroes as appropriate, where:  
• The first 2 digits are the investigational center site number assigned by [CONTACT_118226]  
• The final [ADDRESS_132022] number (SN), assigned in ascending numerical order by 
[CONTACT_1719], without omitting or repeating any number, starting with 001.  
For example, the SI for the twenty -third subject that signs an informed consent form at sit e number 
[ADDRESS_132023] from the study if, in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is 
not in the best interest of the subject to continue the study. Examples of other reasons subjects may 
be discontinued from the study are: a change in compliance with a n inclusion or exclusion 
criterion, occurrence of AEs, occurrence of pregnancy or use of a prohibited therapy. The 
Investigator or designee must inform the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc . study monitor of any subject  
discontinuation .  (Refer to Section 10.2.4  for study medication discontinuation or termination 
criteria).  
 
In case of premature discontinuation of study participation, all efforts will be mad e to perform all 
Week 56 (Visit 16) assessments. The date the subject is withdrawn from the study and the reason 
for discontinuation must be recorded in the subject’s electronic case report forms (eCRFs). All 
withdrawn subjects with ongoing AEs will be followed until th e event has resolved or stabilized, 
until the subject is referred to the care of a local health care professional, or until a determination 
of a cause unrelated to the study medication  or study procedures is made.  
 
6.9. Study Termination  
This study may be termi nated prematurely in whole or in part due to a change in the benefit/risk 
profile for ATI -[ZIP_CODE] Topi[INVESTIGATOR_118190] , business,  or ethical grounds.  This determination may be made by [CONTACT_118227], or by [CONTACT_118228] U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA).  The Sponsor may also elect to terminate the study if enrollment is sufficiently slow to 
prevent the completion of the study in an acceptable timeframe, or if ATI-[ZIP_CODE] development is 
discontinued.

17On Day 29 (Visit 7) subject may be given the option to move into open -label e xtension treatment.   
• If the subject declines the open -label extension, she/he should be seen for the Visit 1 6 (Post -treatment) assessments 30 days following the date of Day 2 9 (Visit 7). 
• If the subject chooses to continue in to the open -label extension, she/he must sign an ICF prior to being dispensed open -label drug and receiving continued study medication application 
instructions.  
• If the subject enrolls in open -label treatment after Day 29 (Visit 7), an unscheduled visit will be conducted in order to obtain consent, review drug applic ation instructions, and dispense 
drug.  This will be considered the official date that the subject i nitiated open -label extension treatment and the scheduling of subsequent visits 8 -16 should be based off of this date  as 
referenced by (OLE xxx) in the treatment day schedule header above.  
 
18Subjects who are eligible and consent to enter the open -label extension will have a baseline CEA and SEA completed at Visit 7 or the unscheduled Visit.

7.5. Duration of the Study  
The an ticipate d time for study enrollment is [ADDRESS_132044]  is 29 days (maximum 
of 28 days of study medication application) .  The post -treatment follow -up period is up to 33 days 
(30 + 3-day window).  The maximum total study duration for the double -blind period from the 
subject’s first visit (Visit 1) through the subject’s last visit (Visit 8) is 92 days.  On Day 1  (Visit 2)  
and Day 28  (Visit 6), subjects are required to be confined at the investigational center until all 
study procedures are completed.  The confinement p eriod may last approximately  10 hours.  The 
duration of the total study participation from Baseline (Visit 2) to the open -label post-treatment 
follow up visit, Week 56 (Visit 1 6) is anticipated to be a maximum of 400 days. The duration of 
the open -label extension  (OLE)  should be based on the date of the visit that the subject initiated 
OLE treatment rather than the days from Baseline (Visit 2) .  For s ubjects who entered the open -
label extension and had a gap  between Visit 7 and entry into the open -label extension due to an 
administrative delay total study participation may be longer than 400 days.

 the interpretation reported either directly on the tracing or in a separate report.   The evaluator will 
interpret the results of every ECG and define th e ECG as “normal ” or “abnormal ”.  Variations 
such as minor ST changes ( i.e., <0.5mm depression) and early re -polarization are considered 
normal.  
 
The investigator must review the evaluator’s interpretation of each subject’s screening  ECG prior 
to Baseline ( Visit 2 ). The investigator will review the evaluator’s interpretation of all ECG reports 
in a timely manner and comment on the clinical relevance of any result that is defined by [CONTACT_118237].  
 
Any abnormalities that are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , clinically significant , must be 
reported as medical history if found prior to the start of the first study medication application or as 
an AE if found after the start of the first study medication application (see Section 10.1.1 ). 
 
9.6. Other Assessments  
9.6.1.  Demographics, Medical History and Alopecia Areata History  
During the S creening visit, the investigator or designee will interview each subject to obtain 
demographic information including date of birth, sex at birth, Fitzpatrick Skin Type, race and, if 
appropriate, ethnicity. The investigator or designee will interview each s ubject to obtain medical 
history information related to all medical conditions, surgeries and disease states th at, at S creening  
(Visit 1) : are ongoing, require concomitant therapy or are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
relevant to the subject’s study participation.  In addition, the medical history of women who are 
not of childbearing potential should reflect the reason e.g. post -menopausal for 1 year or greater, 
bilateral tubal ligation, or hysterectomy.  The investigator or designee will also obt ain an extensive 
AA history at S creening  (Visit 1)  (APPENDIX 3 ). 
 
9.6.2.  Photographic Assessment  
A qualified investigational staff member will take standardized photographs of  the scalp  at 
Baseline (Visit 2) , prior to study medication application , Visit 7 (Day 2 9) prior to the scalp biopsy  
and if enrolled in the open -label extension at the visits detailed in  Section  7.3.  The photographs 
are to document the baseline hair loss and any early signs of hair growth during treatment.  
Equipment, supplies, training and detailed instructi ons for obtaining and managing photographs 
will be provided to the investigational center prior to the initiation of subject enrollment.  
 
 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study and reported on the appropriate Aclaris 
Therapeut ics, Inc.  AE eCRF.   
 
10.1. Definitions  
10.1.1.  Adverse E vents (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigation subject 
administered a study medication (s) and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
Protocol: ATI -[ZIP_CODE] -AA-202 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
  
                                                                           CONFIDENTIAL                                           
Date: 14AUG 2018 , Version 3.0                          Page 48 of 68 
 the study medication .  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign or symptom 
associated with the use of a study medication  (including an abnormal laboratory finding), whether 
or not related to the study medication .  
 
Thus , any new , clinically signifi cant worsening of an existing sign, symptom or disease, should be 
considered an AE.  
 
Every new epi[INVESTIGATOR_118195] a chronic condition ( e.g., headaches, 
seasonal allergies, depression , or hypertension ) should be reported as a separate AE, even if the 
condition is reported in the subject’s medical history.  
 
The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or 
clinically significant  abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwi se, signs , 
symptoms  or abnormal l aboratory values may be used to describe the AE.  
 
Any CS abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication  treatment  should be reported as 
medical history, not as an AE.  
 
10.1.2.  Serious Adverse E vent (SAE)  
A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event  
 
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_118196] -patient basis , even if released the same day. Prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_118197]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a diagnostic test (even if related to an AE) 
or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_118198] (signing the ICF) are not 
themselves reasons for an event to be defined as a SAE.  
 
Important medical events are th ose that may not be immediately life threatening , result in death  or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , but are clearly of major clinical significance  and may  jeopardize the subject or 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. These 
should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

application and continue reporting until the end of the subject’s last study visit . Reporting for SAEs 
must start when the subject signs the ICF and continue until the end of the subject’s last visit.  
 
10.1.5.  Severity  
The investigator is to define the severity  of each AE using the following definitions  as a guideline . 
The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and identify the 
severity that  is the most appropriate according to her/his medical judgment.  
 
Mild  – Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated . 
Moderate  – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity . 
Severe  – Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity.  
10.1.6.  Relationship to Study M edication  
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
medication  and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and consider 
all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject’s relevant medical 
history, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_118199]) to determine the relationship of the AE 
to the study medication . The investigator will define the relationship of an AE  to the study 
medication  by [CONTACT_118238]:  
 
Related  – There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication  and the 
AE. 
 
Not Related  – There is not a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication  
and the AE.  
 
The expression “ reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship ( International Conference on 
Harmonization [ICH] E2A). 
 
10.2. Reporting Procedures  
10.2.1.  Procedures  for Reporting Adverse E vents  
At each post-enrollment  visit, the investigator will question the subject to elicit AEs using a  non-
directive  question such as “Has there been any c hange in your health since the previous study 
visit? ”  If appropriate , based on the subject’s response  to non -directed questioning to elicit AEs, 
the investigator will follow -up with directed question s and appropriate evaluations .

Date: 14AUG [ADDRESS_132061]  be reported in the source document s and on the 
appropriate AE eCRF . AEs that are defined as “Not Related” to the study medication s will be 
followed until they are resolved or until the subject’s last study visit. AEs that are defined as 
“Related” to the study medication s will be followed until they are  resolved or, i f not resolved after 
the subject’s last study visit, until i n the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , the AE reaches a clinically 
stable outcome with or without sequela e. 
 
10.2.2.  Procedure for Reporting a Serious Adverse E vent 
Upon becoming aware of a  SAE  occurring during the AE reporting p eriod, whether or not related 
to the study medication s, the investigator must : 
 
1. Take the appropriate medical action  to ensure the subject’s safety . 
Immediately (within 24 hours) inform the Medical  Monitor  of the SAE by [CONTACT_756]:

4. Inform the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  Medical Monitor of SAE updates by [CONTACT_118239] d by [CONTACT_118240] e-mail. 
5. Comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements  and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
instructions regarding reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Ethics Committee ( EC). 
 
10.2.3.  Safety Monitoring ECG Discontinuation Criteria  
Any subject who develops any of the follow ing ECG criteria during the active treatment phase will 
be instructed to stop study medication and will be withdrawn from the study:  
• A post -study medication ECG result where the evaluator’s interpretation shows any of the 
following:  
➢ Clinically significant rhythm disturbance other than sinus rhythm or ectopic 
supraventricular rhythm (ectopic atrial rhythm)

 ➢ Clinically significant conduction disturbance including PR >240msec, pre -
excitation (delta wave and PR <120msec), second degree or higher AV block   
➢ New finding of QRS>120ms  (if not present at screen. For example, subject s with 
Right Bundle Branch Block at screening would not need to be withdrawn from the 
study if their subsequent ECGs remained unchanged).  
➢ Evidence of QT -interval prolongation, defined as a n increase in the QT cF interval  
>60ms from Visit 1  
➢ New QTcF > 500 ms  
➢ Acute signs of ischemia or infarction  
➢ Any ECG abnormality which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], represent a 
new medical issue of concern  
 
10.2.4.  Study Medication Interruption and Discontinuation

Serum creatinine  >[ADDRESS_132065]  <1.[ADDRESS_132066] or within 10% of baseline  value  
 
If a subject has one or more of the abnormal laboratory values noted in  Table 2, the investigator 
or designee upon receipt and review of the central laboratory report should instruct the subject to 
interrupt  study medication applications. The investigator or designee sho uld ask the subject 
about symptoms, concomitant illnesses and medications and repeat the test(s) as soon as 
possible.  The Medical Monitor must be notified of dose interruptions due to SAEs considered 
related to study medication or laboratory abnormalities  noted in  Table 2. 
  
If the retest confirms the abnormal laboratory value, then the study medication interruption should 
continue , followed by [CONTACT_7850] t esting once a week or sooner at the discretion of the investigator.  
The subject should be followed until the laboratory abnormality(s) return to normal or to baseline 
values.   Study medication can be resumed after the abnormal lab value returns to normal or 
baseline , if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], it is in the best interest of the subject to continue .

 PREGNANCY  
11.1. Definition of Women of Child Bearing Potential (WOCBP)  
WOCBP includes any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone 
successful surgical sterilization ( e.g., hysterectomy,  bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral 
oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as ≥[ADDRESS_132073] 
at Screening  (Visit 1)  and a negat ive UPT at Baseline  (Visit 2)  prior to randomization.  
11.2. Highly Effective Methods of Birth Control  
The Investigator or subinvestigator will discuss the potential risk factors associated with pregnancy 
and the importance of maintaining a highly effective metho d of contraception throughout the study 
with all WOCBP ( for example, those which result in a low failure rate - i.e., less than 1% per year - 
when used consistently and correctly) .  All WOCBP must use a highly effective method  of birth 
control during the st udy and for 30 days after the final application of study medication  in a manner 
such that risk of failure is minimized.   
 
Highly effective methods include : 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of  ovulation:

 o oral 
o intravaginal  
o transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: 
o oral 
o injectable  
o implantable  
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Obstruction of fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_118202] (Essure™)  
• intrauterine hormon e-releasing system (IUS)  
• vasectomized partner1 
• sexual abstinence2 
1Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner 
of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical 
success.  
2 Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if define d as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments  (study duration and [ADDRESS_132074] study medication application) . The reliabil ity of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  
 
WOCBP must be on a highly effective method of birth control for the following timeframes prior 
to study entry:  
• Implants (on a stable dose for ≥90 days)  
• Injectables (on a stable dose for ≥90 days)  
• Patches (on a stable dose for ≥90 days)  
• Combined oral contraceptives (on a sta ble dose for ≥90 days)  
• Intrauterine devices (inserted for ≥30 days)  
 
Prior to trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during 
trial participation and of the potential risk factors associated with pregnancy while in st udy.  The 
subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  During the trial, all 
WOCBP will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_118242] ( e.g., missed or late menstrual period).  
If a s ubject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study medication 
administration, the study medication must be withheld until the results of a pregnancy test are 
available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive s tudy medication and must be 
discharged from the study.  
 
If, following study medication administration, it is determined that the subject may have been or 
was pregnant at the time of study medication exposure (including at least 2 days after study 
medicati on administration) the investigator must immediately notify the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. 
Medical Monitor and record the event on a pregnancy surveillance form. While not an AE or SAE, 
the investigator must report every pregnancy using a pregnancy surveil lance form and follow the 
reporting procedures described for SAE reporting.

12.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Blood Samples  
Blood samples for analysis of the concentration of ATI -50002will be taken from the first 6 subjects 
enrolled into the study on Baseline/ Day 1 (Visit 2) and Day 2 9 (Visit 7) at predose (0 hr), and 1, 
2, 4, 8  hours after study medication application  and on Day 2 (Visit 3 ) and Day 29 (Visit 7), [ADDRESS_132077]  PK parameters  (Cmax, Tmax, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞, t1/2) will 
be calculated, as a minimum and whenever possible, based on the plasma concentrations of  ATI-

 et al, 2014, Jabbari 2016).  Change in ALADIN scores within individ ual subjects will be 
assessed be tween Baseline / Day 1  (Visit 2) , Day 2 9 (Visit 7) and Week 28 (Visit 13)  for subjects 
enrolled in the open -label extension .   
12.5.2.  Histology  
Scalp punch -biopsies will be formalin -fixed and paraffin -embedded and will be sectioned both 
vertically and horizontally by a qualified dermatopathologist.  Specimens will be stained with 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for “routine” histopathologic evaluation  that will include (but is not 
limited to) diagnosis and evaluation of the presence, quantity, location, and quality of any hair, 
hair follicles, and inflammatory infiltrate present.  Additionally, immunohistochemical (IHC) 
stains will be e mployed to ident ify immune cell populations ( e.g., Lymphocytes, cytotoxic T -
lymphocytes (CTLs)), and hair -specific keratins.  IHC stains to assess inflammatory responses will 
include but not be limited to, CD8, HLA -DR and ICAM -1.  Data will be presented as percent 
change from baseline in the number of cells/ high power field in regions of interest (peribulbar 
areas) and in percent change from baseline in the number of cells/mm2. 
 
12.5.3.  Blood  for Immunology  
Blood samples will be stained with cell surface antibodies for fluorescen ce acquisition cell sorting 
(FAC) analysis.  FACS experiments will allow for assessment of the subset and activation status 
of immune cells involved in AA.  
 
12.5.4.  Secondary Analyses  
Summary descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, SD) by [CONTACT_118243] f or all efficacy 
parameters.  Secondary efficacy parameters are described below:  
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints include mean change from baseline in the SALT score at Week 
28 (Visit 1 3), Week  40 (Visit 14) and Week  52 (Visit 15) .   
 
The percentage hair growth will be calculated as the mean change from Baseline (Visit  2) scores 
compared to end of treatment Week 2 8 (Visit 1 3), Week 40 (Visit 14) and Week 52 (Visit 15) .   
 
Mean change from baseline in the ALODEX score, proportion of subjects achieving a ≥ 5 0% hair 
growth compared with baseline.   
 
Treatment satisfaction will be summarized.  
 
The ALODEX score analysis will use the same methodology as specified for SALT score analysis.

:  Scalp Biopsy  
All scalp p unch biopsies will be performed by [CONTACT_118257]  7.3. Note:  The scalp biopsy for pharmacokinetic analysis performed on Day 2 and 
Day 29 should be obtained after the area of the scalp to be biopsied is tape stripped using 5 
D-Squame circular discs.  
 
The biopsy site will be anesthetized with an injection of 1% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. The 
lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_118211].  After 
approximately [ADDRESS_132093] y pressure to the biopsy site using a 4mm diameter 
skin punch (a sterile cylindrical tube with a sharp edge). The punch is twisted until the blade of the 
skin punch has pi[INVESTIGATOR_118212]. 
Depending  on the thickness of the skin in the area being biopsied, the cylindrical blade may be 
buried to the hub (approximately 6mm in depth). After the blade has sufficiently cored or carved 
out a cylinder of skin, the skin punch is removed. Nontraumatic forceps are used to gently grasp 
the cored skin, pulling upward to remove the core and reveal the subcutaneous fat. Scissors are 
used to cut the cored tissue free from the underlying subcutaneous fat. Care should be taken to 
ensure that the specimen is cut well be low the level of the hair follicle.  The specimen is placed 
immediately into the appropriate media. Once the specimen has been removed, pressure is applied 
to the biopsy site with a sterile 2 x 2 gauze. The biopsy site is then closed with several simple 
interrupted sutures. Either an absorbable or nonabsorbable suture may be used at the investigator’s 
discretion. Antibiotic ointment is applied,  and the area is covered with a standard Band -Aid or 
sterile gauze and paper tape. If the presence of adjacent hair  makes adhesion of a bandage difficult, 
antibiotic ointment will be used without a covering. When necessary, a small pressure dressing 
may be applied. Subjects will be instructed in wound care , to avoid applying study medication  to 
the biopsy site until th e sutures are removed  and will be advised to call the research unit if they 
have any concerning signs or symptoms during healing.   A follow -up visit will  be scheduled 
approximately 2 weeks later, to remove sutures , if necessary,  and examine the healing pro cess of 
the biopsy site to ensure it is healing appropriately.

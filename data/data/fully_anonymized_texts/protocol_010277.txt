1.0 PROTOCOL SUMM ARY AND/OR SCHE MA 
 
This phase II study  of the anti-GD2 murine IgG3  monoclonal antibody  3F8 combined  with 
granuloc yte-macrophage  colony  stimulating factor (GM-CSF)  will assess response  in of 
primary re fractory ne uroblasto ma in bone  marrow (i.e., inc omplete res ponse to sta ndard 
treatment). The high-dose 3F8 usage is four fold greater than the standard 3F8 dosage 
used in prior phase  2 studies  of 3F8.  13-cis-Retino ic Acid will  be used in  this protocol 
after patients are ev aluated for re sponse  to 3F8/GM -CSF.   We will apply re al-time 
quant itative  RT-PCR  methodology  targeting  GD2    synthase  mRNA  for  monitoring 
response  in bone marrow;  we will test the hypothesis  that early bone marrow  response 
has prognos tic importan ce. 
 
2.0 OBJECTI VES A ND SCIENTIF IC AIMS  
 
Primary Objecti ve 
• Assess  the activity of high-dose 3F8/GM -CSF against  persistent neuroblastoma in 
bone marrow  of patie nts who have no other evidence of dise ase by [CONTACT_879856].  
 
Secondary  Objecti ves 
• Apply  real-time quanti tative RT-PCR to test the hypoth esis that the minimal 
residu al disease content of bone  marrow a fter the first tr eatments with 3F8/GM - 
CSF has signi ficant prognostic  impact on pro gression -free surviv al. 
 
• Monitor  safety of the high-dose antibody  treatment, to assure no side-effects or 
noxious se quelae develop or e merge that we re not seen  in the  prior ph ase I study. 
 
3.0 BACKG ROUND AND RATIONALE  
3.1       Disease ba ckground:   Neuroblas toma  (NB)  is  the  most  common  extracranial 
solid tu mor of childhoo d; 50-60% of patie nts present with an unrese ctable primary tumor 
and metastases in bone marrow  (BM).[ADDRESS_1229446] improved  remission  rates  in young  patients2-4; res ults have been less 
impressive  in  adolescents  and  adults  in  whom  NB  is  especially  chemoresistant.5,6 
Realiz ation of  an effective  strategy for eradi cating minimal residu al disease (MRD)  has 
remained  a formidable  challenge.  Post-surgical use of local radiotherapy helps  contr ol 
MRD  in the primary site.7  Myel oablative therapy (with  stem-cell support)  has been the 
most common approach  for eradica ting MRD  in distant  sites.  The long-term relapse -free 
surviv al rate in a recent  nation al study was only ~20%,  although the vitamin A derivative  
13-cis-retinoic  acid  helped  to  improve  overall  surviv al.8       These  results,  plus  the 
poten tially severe  toxicities of chemotherapy  and radiotherapy, are compelling reasons 
for pursuing novel the rapeutic appr oaches, incl uding immunotherapy mediated by  [CONTACT_14181]-

3.2       Rationale  for 3F8:  3F8 is a murine  IgG3  MoAb  that is well suited for targe ted 
immunotherapy.  The reasons  are several.  First, the intensive chemotherapy required to 
produce  in NB patients the  minimal disea se state optimal for immunotherapy  results in 
prolonged  lymphopenia.  This setting is  unfavora ble for active immunotherapy  but allows 
passive  immunothera py since  the patient is unable  to reject allogen eic, xenoge neic, or 
genet ically-engine ered MoAbs.   Second,  3F8 recogn izes the ganglio side GD2.24     This 
target antigen is highly expressed on NB  (but has re stricted distribution in nor mal human 
tissues), is not modulat ed from the cell surface when  bound  by [CONTACT_852372],  and is genet ically 
stable (unlike tumor-associa ted antigens such as immunoglobulin  idiotypes on lymphoma 
cells).25-[ADDRESS_1229448],  scintigraphy  using 131I-3F8 confirms that 3F8 localizes selectively to 
GD2(+) tu mor depos its in patients.[ADDRESS_1229449] een uptake .28,29    Fourth, 3F8 
mediates  destru ction in vitro , in a dose-depen dent manner,  of GD2(+) human tumor cells 
by [CONTACT_852374]30 and by [CONTACT_310195], cult ured monocytes, and 
neutrop hils.31-33  Finally, the  capacity of 3F8  to activate c omplement (C’) on NB cel ls 
(which  lack decay  accelerating factor34) raises the possi bility of C’-mediated  lysis in 
patients and the  release of  C’ fragments that may elicit an  inflammatory  influx of 
granuloc ytes capab le of lysing  3F8-labeled  tumor cells.  Furthermore, the depos ition of 
C’ fragments C3b and iC3b on NB cells may enhance  ADCC because  the receptor for 
iC3b – variously  called Mac-1, CR3,  CD11b/ CD18, or άMβ2-integrin – is a key element 
in anti-GD2 MoAb -mediated tu mor-cell kill by [CONTACT_879857],35,[ADDRESS_1229450] 
abundant circulating c lass of leukocyte.  
 
3.3       Rationale  for GM-CSF:   GM-CSF can amplify 3F8 anti-NB activity in patients 
via effects on granulocy tes and macrophages.  Reasons  for combining  GM-CSF with  3F8 
include the following.  First,  granulocyte  production is  only transiently suppress ed by 
[CONTACT_11553],  and GM-CSF incre ases neutrop hil and eosinophil production and is well 
tolerated  compared  to other cytokines such as interleu kin-2.[ADDRESS_1229451] ic significance, and 
eosinoph ils exhib it potent antitumor activity in ani mal models.43,44   Fourth,  activated 
monocytes -macrophages  efficiently  phagocyto se NB cells,  and expos ure in vitro or in 
vivo to GM -CSF primes monocytes -macrophages  for greater antineo plastic 
cytoto xicity.33,39,45-50  Fifth, GM-CSF enhances  the proliferation, matura tion, and function 
of  antigen -presen ting  cel ls,  including  antigen  proce ssing  and  presen tation  by 
[CONTACT_879858]37,51,52   -  effects  that  might  promote  induction,  or 
antitumor activity, of an idioty pic network.53-56   Finally, GM-CSF is not a growth  factor 
for NB cells in vi tro.57

3.4       Rationale  for  quanti tating  BM  disease  by  [CONTACT_5203]-time  RT-PCR:     Curative 
strategies for stage  [ADDRESS_1229452] on rese ctability of 
primary tumors and surgical re moval of all  visible tumor, followed  by [CONTACT_86464], 
reduces  the risk of relapse in the primary site to <10%.4,7   Dose -intensive chemotherapy 
eliminates  histolo gically evident  BM involve ment in 90% of high-risk cases.[ADDRESS_1229453] – 
which is r eadily as sessed in BM.  
 
Adjuvant  treatments, such as immunotherapy  with MoAbs, may make gradual  and not 
quantum changes  in MRD, which  by [CONTACT_879859]58 or radiologic techniqu es. The availability of more sensitive methods  for 
quant itating occult  tumor cells in sequent ial BM speci mens can allow deter mination of 
the efficacy and  optimal duration of adjuvant  treatment.  The absence  of detectable tumor 
cells in BM can serve  as a surroga te end point for the adjuv ant treatment strategy, while 
quant itative data  on BM disea se will help  detect relap se earlier and indicate a need for a 
change in  treatment. 
 
We58-65a and other s66-[ADDRESS_1229454]. 
The limit of detec tion for immunocytology  is 1/105  to 1/106  cells; RT-PCR  has slightly 
superi or sensitivity with a range  of 1/105 to 1/[ADDRESS_1229455] routinely also obta ined 
speci mens from bilat eral anterior iliac crests since sampling from multiple  sites increases 
detection rates.65a    Histologic  studies alone,  however,  yield an underestimate of BM 
involve ment, as shown  by [CONTACT_879860].68.69    For >[ADDRESS_1229456] ic significance.61 
 
Ease  of use, superi or sensitivity, and grea ter specificity prompted us to study the utility of 
real-time quantitative RT-PCR  of GD2 synthase  mRNA for the detection of  rare NB cells 
in BM.  The marker  GD2 synthase  is partic ularly pertinent because  NB cells  express 
ganglio side  GD2  at  high  density,  with  li ttle  het erogen eity  within  tumors  or  among 
patients, and this surface antigen has limited expres sion in normal human tissues.25-27 
The key enzyme required  for GD2  synthesis is GD2  synthase (β 1,4-N- 
acetylgalactosamineylt ransferase,  EC [IP_ADDRESS]).62    In a study  of 155 BM samples (100

patients), the trans cript levels correlated well with the number of NB cells in BM as 
measured  by [CONTACT_238033].[ADDRESS_1229457]. 
 
 
3.5       Clinical  experience  with 3F8/G M-CSF:    Prior clinical studies of 3F8/GM-CSF 
established  1) this combination’s excellent activity against refractory BM disea se (IRB 
protoc ols 94-018 and 03-077);  2) the safety of  markedly  augmented  3F8 dosing (IRB 
protoc ol 05-015: “3F8 antibody  dose escalation plus  granu locyte -macrophage  colony- 
stimulating  factor  in high-risk neuroblasto ma: A phase  I trial”)71a  compared  to dosages 
derived  from pi[INVESTIGATOR_852363] 1980s, an importa nt finding since  in vitro studies show a 
3F8 dose -dependent  lysis of NB cells (see section 3.2 ); and 3)  the superio rity of 
subcutaneo us  over  int ravenous  (iv)  use  of  GM-CSF,  for  both  an ti-NB  ef fect  and 
treatment simplification (which  helps patients and medical  staff - and promotes wide 
availability of this t reatment) 71-[ADDRESS_1229458] daily dosage of 3F8 has been 20 mg/m2.  In the IRB protocol 
05-015 dose escalation phase  I study, 3F8 dosages  up to 160 mg/m2  were  possible 
without  dose-limiting toxicity, as reported71a. (That protoc ol also used a small dose of 
heat-modified  3F8  –  2  mg/m2,  iv  over  ~5  minutes  –  administer ed  just  before  the 
treatment dose,  as a way to modify  the major acute toxi city of pain .)  For the current 
protoc ol, we chose  daily 3F8 dosage 80 mg/m2 because in the  dose escalation phase I 
study,  serum levels  were  not significantly different  at a 3F8 daily dosage of >80 mg/m2 
(see Fig ure 1), and exc ellent anti-NB activ ity was seen at 80 mg/m2.

3.6       HAMA  response/idio typic network:     In a study  of [ADDRESS_1229459] 
treated with 3F8  alone, pat ients w ith a sel f-limited (transient) HAMA  response had 
significantly better  PFS than patients who had persis tently high HAMA titers or no 
HAMA  formation.15 This assoc iation of a transient  low level HAMA/anti -idiotype (Ab2) 
antibody   response   with   better   PFS   was   a   seemingly   paradoxi cal   finding   since 
HAMA/Ab2  blocks  3F8 binding  to tumor cells.  The unexpected  observation  regarding 
HAMA/Ab2  and survival  led to the hypothesis  of a host idiotypic  network induced  by 
3F8 (Ab1)  and respons ible for long-term t umor contr ol.  The idioty pic network  was first 
postul ated by [CONTACT_86470]75 for immune regula tion and later demonstr ated in human disea se 
models,  including  cancer patients.76-79 Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2)  in the  HAMA  pool 
may mimic antigen G D2 and sti mulate an Ab3 an tibody resp onse.  We previously rep orted 
the association of anti -anti-idiotype (Ab3)  with prolonged  surviv al among patients who 
underwent  myeloabla tive therapy with autologous stem-cell rescue.[ADDRESS_1229460] been de monstrated .54,55 
 
In our study of 34  patients,  consi stent with the e mergence  of an  idiotypic network, Ab3 
(anti-anti-idiotype)  and Ab3' (anti -GD2) respo nse at  6-14 months after treatment with 3F8 
alone  correlated with i mproved  PFS, and higher  Ab3 titers showed  a stronger  correlation 
with  improved  outco me,  while  non-idiotype  antibody  re sponses  (anti-mouse  or  anti- 
tumor nuclear  antigen) had  no apparent  impact on outcome.56    Since  GD2 is an auto- 
antigen,  induced  Ab3' response repre sented  a breakdown in self-tolerance.   We 
hypothes ized  that  significant  ri ses  in  Ab3  or  Ab3'  w ould  not  be  possib le  unless 
suppress or pathways  were re moved and naive T  or B cells were  allowed to repo pulate. 
Following  intensi ve chemotherapy  that eliminates a large  part of the lymphoid  syste m,

exposure  to tu mor-selective Ab1s  (3F8) might induce  unique Ab2s  that could  bias the 
recov ering repert oire towards  the G D2 antigen  network.  The potential for biasing the 
immune system towards  speci fic antigens  has been well documented  in murine  models80

3.7       Isotr etinoin  (13-cis-retinoic acid) was shown  in a rando mized national study  to

of care for NB patients  in remission.  It will be used in this protocol after patients are 
evalu ated for respo nse to 3F8/GM -CSF – same dosage,  same timing as in the predecessor  
3F8/GM -CSF (IRB 03 -077) protoc ol. 
 
3.8       Interpret ations and implica tions:    Various  strategies have undergone  clinical 
testing to promote immune-mediated attack against cancer.  However,  few clinical trials 
have used MoAb -targeted immunotherapy  against solid tumors in children or  adults, 
espec ially with ADCC  as the principal underlying immune cytotox ic mechanis m.  Also, 
an  antineoplastic  role  for  granulocytes  has  received  scant  attention.23      A  treatment 
program co mbining  3F8 and GM-CSF thus represen ts a step towards  filling a gap in the 
emerging field of  immunotherapy.  
 
This phase II trial ex ploits re cent findings th at promise to op timize the anti -NB ac tivity of 
3F8/GM -CSF – namely, high dosing of  3F8 and subcutaneous  use of GM-CSF.  Further, 
RT-PCR  analysis  of response  in BM, which  has proved  informative in past studies, will 
be applied to monitor  anti-NB activity of the  immunothera py, with an emphasis  on early 
recogn ition of treatment efficacy.   The studies  focus on BM; findings  may not reflect 
total body tumor burden.  Metas tatic NB is, however,  a systemic disease, and, as with 
leuke mia,88 BM status appears  to approxi mate the overall disease  state.  If the RT-PCR 
method  proves to be sensiti ve, it will provide  a useful tool for measuring  NB-cell content 
in BM as a patient goes through  treatment.  The ability to identify patients not likely to 
benefit from further  use of a given  adjuvant  therapy will allow a more timely switch  to a 
possibly  better treatment.  We hypothesize  that quantifying GD2 synthase transcri pt levels 
will help s tratify patients by [CONTACT_852378], define tumor thresholds  that corr elate with 
favorable  clinical outcome, and provide  progn ostic cla ssification for patients receiving 
immunotherapy.    Risk-related  molecul ar  guidelines  can  be  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_879844] t reatment progra ms.

Our  RT-PCR  method  provides  a  quant itative  measure,  such  that  the  percentage  of 
patients who achieve  CR in BM, and the degree of respon se with 3F8/GM-CSF,  can be 
calculated and compared to other  adjuvant  treatments.  With NB, where  rando mized trials 
are difficult to  carry  out because of the  small number of affected  patien ts, such 
quant itative analyses  acquire  even great er utility for rapi[INVESTIGATOR_879845] a cu rative treatment progra m. 
 
The findings  regarding  RT-PCR  utility  in the adjuvant  setting, granul ocyte activation, 
and idiotypic network will have gener al implications for MoAb -based the rapeut ic 
strategies against s olid tumors in hu mans. 
 
The ease of administration of the treatments (a subcu taneous injection of GM-CSF, 
which  is given at home, and a 30-minute iv infusion  of 3F8 in the outpatient clinic), plus 
their transient acute si de-effects, are compatible  with usage of this  regimen beyond our 
hospit al – a strong  positive factor in furthering product  develop ment, which  in fact is 
underway in  a multi-institutional study of 3F8/GM-CSF using the pre vious 3F8 dosage.

5.3.1    Source and  Pharmacology:    The exact  mechanism  of retinoic acid (RA) - 
induced  matura tion of tumor cells is not know n. In NB c ell lines it has been  shown to 
down  regul ate MYCN RNA and  protein expression, and such down  regula tion correlates 
with the ability of isotretinoin  to induce tumor cell growth  arrest.  Recent studies using 
gene transfection  directly implicate down  regul ation of MYCN expressi on by [CONTACT_852380] a key event  in achiev ing sustained arrest  of NB cell proliferation. RA also appea rs to 
enhance  normal  hematopoie tic  differenti ation  by  [CONTACT_879863], respectively. Metabolism: RA is 99.9%  bound in plasma 
(almost entirely to albumin) and has a half-life of 10 -20 hours.  The major metabolite  is 4- 
oxoisot retinoin, and excretion is in the urine  and feces.  A single  oral dose of 10 0mg/m2 
isotretinoin will  produ ce peak  plasma levels of 1-2mM. The mean peaktime as 3.2 hours 
after 80mg orally, with a terminal t½ of 10 to 20 hours.  Administering  160 mg/m2/day to 
children after autologous bone  marrow  transp lantation has been shown  to achie ve 13-cis- 
RA levels of  5 to 7 micromolar. 
 
5.3.2    For mulation  and  Stability:  Isotretinoin,  which  is  the  13-cis  isomer  of 
retinoic acid, will be used. This is a yellow--orange cryst alline powder  with a molecular 
weight  of 300.44.  Isotretinoin is sensitive to light and oxygen, and so it should not be 
removed from the  capsule  for longer than one hour prior to administration to the patient 
and it sho uld be kept in  subdued li ght as much as possib le. 
 
5.3.3   Guidelin es for Administration: PO with  fat-containing food or milk to 
enhance  absorption.  Administration  of the entire capsule is to be encou raged and small 
children can  be trained to swallow t hem using si milar sized candy.

14.0 BIOSTAT ISTICS  
 
The objective of this phase II trial is to assess the anti-NB activity of  high-dose 3F8 plus 
GM-CSF  in  patients  with  high-risk  NB  persistent  in  BM  –  specifically,  primary 
refractory disease  in BM (i.e., incomplete response  to induction  chemotherapy).  The 
high-dose 3F8 usage  is four fold greater than the standard  3F8 dosage  used in prior phase 
II stu dies. 
 
In A(6), treatment was changed to u se stand ard dose 3F8 (20  mg/m2/day)  for all cy cles 
instead of  high-dose 3F8  for cycles 1  and 2.  Pat ients treated as such a re evaluab le for

The  Data  and  Safety  Monito ring  (DSM)  Plans  at  Memorial  Sloan -Kette ring  Cancer 
Center  were approved  by [CONTACT_879874] 2001.  The plans 
address the new  polici es set forth by  [CONTACT_30590] “Policy of the 
National C ancer Ins titute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinic al Trials” which c an be 
found at:  http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/res earchers/dsm/index.html.   The DSM  Plans  at 
MSKCC  were established and are monitored  by [CONTACT_879875].  The 
MSKCC  Data  and Safety Monito ring Plans  can be  found on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: 
http://inside2/clinresearch/Docu ments/MSKCC%20Data%2 0and%20Sa fety%20Mon itori

There  are several different mechanis ms by [CONTACT_30592], 
safety and quality.  There are institutional  processes in place for quality  assurance  (e.g.,

staff educat ion on clinical research QA)  and departmental procedu res for quality control, 
plus there are two institutional comm ittees  that are responsible  for monitoring the 
activities of our clinical trials programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  Mon itoring 
Committee  (DSM C) for Phase  I and II clinical trials, and the Data  and Safety  Mon itoring 
Board  (DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials,  report to the Center’s  Research  Council and 
Institutional Review Board.  
 
During  the protoc ol development and review process,  each protoc ol will be assessed for 
it’s level of risk and degree of monitoring required.  Every  type of protocol (e.g.,  NIH 
sponsored, in-house  sponsored,  industrial sponsored, NCI coopera tive group, etc.) will be 
addressed and the monitoring procedures will be  established at the time of protoc ol 
activation.  
 
Institutional monitoring  plan for phase I and phase II trials: Memorial Sloan -Kettering 
Cancer  Center (MSKC C) has estab lished standa rd procedur es for data safety monitoring 
of clinical research (see appendi x).   For Phase II trials, these  procedures inc lude 
conside ration of accrual rates, toxi city, adhere nce to dos e-escalation s chedules, ad verse 
event  notification and data  recor ding.  Thera peutic respo nses are logged on a central 
databa se and approxi mately 50% are reviewed by  [CONTACT_86493].  An annual 
report  of the tri al’s progress is sent to the  IRB.  All of the  procedures  for Phase  II studies 
outlined in MSKCC’s  policy  are applicable to the current trial and will be followed  by 
[CONTACT_473].  The analysis  of sa fety will in clude all patients who receive at lea st one 
dose of stu dy medicati on.  Adver se events, in cluding all tox ic effects of treatment, will be 
tabulated i ndividu ally, and  summarized by [CONTACT_879876] m, according to dosage  of study 
medication  (single  dose as well as cumulative  doses of 3F8 and  GM-CSF),  and according 
to severity or  toxicity grade.  Laboratory da ta will  be tabulated and su mmarized  by 
[CONTACT_732673], as  well as on  the basis of  MSKCC speci fied nor mal ranges.

1.Statement of Purpose: State the scientific  aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to  be tested.
To determine the long-term effect of severe  antecedent hypoglycemia in T1DM  patients 
on brain energy  substrate metabolism, in particular alternate energy  substrate and 
glucose metabolism. We will measure  brain fuel uptake  kinetics across the blood brain 
barrier into the brain, brain glucose  levels  and neuronal and glial TCA cycle activity. We 
will further explore the relationships between absolute  neurotransmitter and brain 
metabolite levels in healthy control subjects and Type 1 diabetes subjects and how they 
vary across different brain regions.
2.Background: Describe the background information that led to 
the plan for  this project. Provide references to support the 
expectation of  obtaining useful scientific data.
2.1.1.Counterregulatory  failure  in intensely  treated 
diabetic patients.
The long-term impact  of hypoglycemia on brain 
function and development is becoming  clearer {Ho, 
2008 #1731} and confirms the long held fear of 
hypoglycemia as the most dreaded immediate 
complication of T1DM treatment with insulin  {DCCT, 
1997 #1361;Flykanaka-Gantenbein,  2004

#1391;Kodl, 2008 #1693}. Complications  of uncontrolled  hyperglycemia in diabetic 
patients are well established and can be avoided via intensive insulin  therapy {DCCT, 
1993 #1245;[LOCATION_006]PDS, 1998  #1360}. Constrained by [CONTACT_105703], measures that 
allow for intensive glucose control  without a negative impact on normal brain function  are 
still needed. The counterregulatory mechanisms  to low glucose  include responses on 
several levels: In the pancreas  insulin secretion is suppressed; glucagon  and epi[INVESTIGATOR_105675]-threatening 
state {Cryer,  1994 #1238}. One or several  of these are compromised  in T1DM  patients 
when compared to non-diabetic individuals mostly  by [CONTACT_105704] {Amiel,  1987 #1363;Amiel, 1988 #1364}. The experiments 
proposed here are part of the effort to identify ways that would protect  the brain 
from serious  hypoglycemic injury.
2.1.2.Characterization of brain metabolism in vivo by [CONTACT_105705].
In vivo biochemical  assessment of metabolism by [CONTACT_105706] 13C/2H allows real time observation of 
neurotransmitter cycle activity in the brain (11; 12). Glutamine-glutamate neurotransmitter  
cycling is stochiometrically  coupled to the turns  of the TCA cycle, thereby [CONTACT_105707] a model  of brain 
metabolism (1)
(Figure 1). This method allows  characterization of fuel uptake across the blood  brain  
barrier as well as brain metabolism under different physiological and disease conditions. 
Infused acetate is predominantly metabolized in glial cells, while  labeled lactate, beta- 
hydroxy-butyrate (BHB)  or glucose are preferably metabolized  in neurons, where lactate  
and glucose (but not BHB) enter  the TCA cycle  by [CONTACT_105708]-CoA, 
a reaction catalyzed by [CONTACT_105709] (PDH) (13-16). The effects 
of peripheral changes  on plasma  metabolite  concentrations are very closely monitored 
and accounted for by [CONTACT_105710] (17). The recent observation by [CONTACT_105711], 
but well controlled T1DM (18) led us to perform  similar experiments in our animal model 
of three days of recurrent hypoglycemia (3dRH). Application of NMR spectroscopy  to 
the study  of brain  fuel metabolism in our in vivo animal  model of recurrent 
hypoglycemia allowed us to measure  brain TCA cycle activity in real time. This is 
particularly relevant to the metabolic adaptations in T1DM patients.
2.1.3.In vivo measurement of brain acetate and lactate metabolism  and determination  
of TCA cycle activity.
From the infusion of labeled 13C-acetate into control and recurrently hypoglycemic 
animals under eu- and hypoglycemia we gained valuable new insights that are now 
guiding our choice of alternate  fuels: Our experiments recapi[INVESTIGATOR_105676] (18). Due to the ability  to 
infuse larger doses  of acetate that allowed us to achieve higher blood  concentrations than 
is ethically permissible in humans,  we were able to determine  that fluxes contributing to 
neuronal metabolism were particularly affected  by [CONTACT_105712]

(Figure 2). At euglycemia 
we observed a striking 
increase in basal glucose 
consumption (CMR glc) 
following pretreatment 
with three bouts of 
hypoglycemia in the 
3dRH animals when 
compared to controls,  
with only a small  change 
in acetate utilization 
(CMR ac). In contrast  
under hypoglycemia, 
whole brain glucose 
utilization markedly 
dropped in the 3dRH 
group, while no such 
change was observed  in 
controls.
We were able to attribute 
this net change to a 
neuronal compartment-  
specific response to 
hypoglycemia: Animals 
from both groups 
decreased their glucose

astrocytic compartment. (controls euglycemia - black, controls hypoglycemic  – grey,

and lactate utilization in astrocytes under hypoglycemia, whereas  neuronal pyruvate 
dehydrogenase flux (VpdhN) increased  in control animals, but markedly  decreased in 3dRH 
animals by 50%. This difference  translates  further into parallel changes of the neuronal 
TCA cycle rates (VtcaN) between  groups  (Figure 2), suggesting a subsequent decrease in 
ATP production and energy deficit. Thus while control animals  can increase neuronal TCA 
cycle activity during  hypoglycemia via enhanced
substrate influx through pyruvate  dehydrogenase,  
animals pre-exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia do 
not show such compensation.
These findings suggest that a more neuron-specific 
alternate fuel would  be required  to prevent neuronal 
energy deficits under  acute hypoglycemia in the 
clinical setting, since acetate is predominantly 
supporting astroglial metabolism. Such a candidate 
fuel that can be safely  delivered  to humans is the 
ketone body BHB.  It is, like acetate,  taken up into the 
brain via monocarboxylic acid transporters (19). This 
makes it a particularly attractive  candidate molecule, 
since its brain levels would be enhanced  under the
very  circumstances  under  which  it  is supposed toFigure  3: Time courses of 13C label

7support metabolism. Exciting results  from a study of infused lactate -another 
predominantly neuronal fuel - in control  and 3dRH animals  at euglycemia have revealed 
a faster label  appearance in the metabolites glutamine  and glutamate  (Figure 3), 
suggesting enhanced  neuronal lactate metabolism  after recurrent hypoglycemia and 
confirming our initial hypothesis.
We have identified changes in fuel transport into the brain and further  utilization 
via neuronal PDH that may underlie the adaptations seen in T1DM  patients. BHB  
may be particularly well suited to compensate for this deficit  since it is taken up by

level that may occur in the context  of recurrent hypoglycemia.
2.1.5.Effect of Ketone  Supplementation on Cognition under  Hypoglycemia.
Cognitive impairment  is the most serious adverse consequence of insulin-induced 
hypoglycemia. It is unknown to what  degree  hypoglycemia-induced cognitive  dysfunction  
can be alleviated  in T1DM subjects by [CONTACT_105715]. In contrast  to lactate, our MR spectroscopy measurements 
of brain metabolism  in humans  suggest  that intensively treated  T1DM  patients with 
hypoglycemia unawareness could particularly benefit from oral ketone (e.g. ester) 
supplementation, which already is safely being used in neurodegenerative diseases  many 
of which are now known to have a neuro-metabolic basis, such as Alzheimer’s disease. 
For this purpose, we will conduct studies designed to examine the potential value of this 
approach by [CONTACT_105716] (or placebo)  in T1DM subjects during a hyperinsulinemic- 
hypoglycemic clamp  in conjunction with testing  of cognitive function.  This will lay the basis 
for subsequent trials exploring the novel use of therapeutic doses of oral ketonectrl_hypoclamp-euclamp

which could serve  as adjunct  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_105677] T1DM.
2.1.6.Influence of lactate on brain 13C/2H-glucose metabolism  under hypoglycemia in 
intensively treated T1DM subjects with hypoglycemia  unawareness
We have  made the surprising observation in our animal model that infused lactate does 
not contribute to the increased oxidation rate of RH animals during hypoglycemia [20], 
which has since been supported by [CONTACT_105717] T1DM patients  [21]. In further follow-up 
experiments, we used DCA, an inhibitor of brain pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase  isoforms 
and modulator of glucose metabolism,  to demonstrate a possible important role for 
regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase flux under hypoglycemia in an animal model  of RH 
that recapi[INVESTIGATOR_105678]. No study to date has directly examined the 
interaction of glucose and lactate metabolism under hypoglycemia in the brain of 
intensively treated T1DM subjects. Novel studies conducted  under this protocol will yield 
this critical  new information needed to tailor our therapeutic approaches to protect the 
brain from hypoglycemic injury.

To define the effect of alternate fuels  on brain  neurotransmitter metabolism in 
hypoglycemia unawareness we will compare  its ability to modulate  the oxidation  of 
infused stable  isotope-labeled glucose  in healthy adults with that in age- and weight 
matched subjects with c-peptide-negative  T1DM with a history of hypoglycemia 
unawareness. During clamped hypoglycemia all subjects will undergo an NMR  
spectroscopy scan that permits detection of the stable isotope  used, which will be either 
carbon13 (13C) or deuterium (2H). Using isotopi[INVESTIGATOR_105681]-glucose as a tracer together 
with a co-infusion of 350mM  unlabeled lactate, we will measure neuronal  glucose 
metabolite enrichment, visualize them  in three dimensions and determine the time 
courses of enrichment. These will be fitted with our metabolic  model to determine whether  
increased lactate stimulates PDH flux and glucose oxidation under hypoglycemia  and to 
what degree this varies across different  regions of the brain.
Subject Selection and Preparation :
Two groups of subjects aged  18-65 years will be studied:
1)Group  1 will be T1DM subjects (C-peptide  negative, HbA1c <7.5%)  with a history of 
severe hypoglycemia  and hypoglycemia unawareness as assessed  by [CONTACT_105720] (see below) and as evidenced by [CONTACT_30230],  questionnaire and  glucose 
log and/or continuous glucose monitoring.
2)Group  2 will be non-diabetic healthy  subjects (fasting plasma  glucose < 100 mg/dL, 
normal HbA1c) who are matched for age and gender  to the type 1 diabetic subjects,  
to serve  as controls  for the study.
The Ryan HYPO score:
During a 4-week period  subjects record  blood  sugar levels 5 times  per day. On the 
occasion that the glucose  recorded  is <54 mg/dl subjects are asked to describe the 
details of the event  using a questionnaire  recently developed at Edmonton  by [CONTACT_105721]. to more objectively define hypoglycemia severity. Particular emphasis in the 
questionnaire is devoted to the type of symptoms and whether help was required to

generated based on the glucose  readings  and the patient’s  reported hypoglycemic 
events. A composite  score in the upper quartile of T1DM  control patients will be 
required for enrollment in this study.
Subjects will be placed into one of following cohorts:
Cohort 1: Subjects  from group 1 and group  2 will be scheduled  for three study sessions  
as described below. A screening  visit, an MR spectroscopy  scan without 
hyperinsulinemic clamp (euglycemia) and an MR spectroscopy scan  during a

Session A: Screening  visit (YNHH Clinical  Research Unit):
At the screening visit, study subjects in both the control and T1DM  groups will complete  
the informed consent form for participation in voluntary clinical research.  Demographic  
and clinical data collected will be reviewed by [CONTACT_105722].
Once consented, all subjects will be further  screened with a medical history & physical 
examination, blood work (electrolytes,  hematocrit, creatinine, liver function tests and 
HbA1c) and a 12-lead  electrocardiogram (EKG). Detailed subject inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are listed below (Human subjects – Subject recruitment). Subjects in the T1DM 
group only will be instructed to record  their glucose readings to determine degree and 
frequency of hypoglycemia  as described  above. The subject will perform the preliminary  
cognitive tests  at this point if they are selected for Cohort [ADDRESS_117291]

12Session B: NMR spectroscopy without tracer infusion (Magnetic Resonance 
Research Center)
Subjects may be scheduled to arrive on the evening before the study if arriving  early will 
be a difficulty.  If such a case occurs, subjects will be admitted to the HRU  for an overnight 
stay to be there for the morning without  any delay.
On the morning of study, subjects  will arrive  directly  at the MRRC. A member  of the 
research team will verify that if the subject is from the T1DM group , the diabetic subject 
(as previously instructed) has taken his/her normal morning dose of insulin  (or has 
continued to wear the insulin pump).  This will not apply to subjects that are from the 
control group of non-diabetics participants. A urine pregnancy test will be completed on 
all female  subjects of child bearing potential. Any female testing positive  will be excluded 
from the study.  All subjects will meet  the staff, study procedures will be reviewed,  and 
they will be exposed to the instrumentation and then placed in the scanner  for NMR 
spectroscopy.
Imaging Procedures with the 4T/ 7T Bruker Advance NMR spectrometer (Bruker 
Instruments, Inc, Bellerica, MA) with a 94 cm bore:  Proton MRS  will be performed using 
the outer  1H decoupling coils of the 13C probe at 4T. Parameters and pulse sequences 
for GABA  and glutamate acquisition will be the standard ones presently  being established 
for this coil by [CONTACT_105723]:  Subjects will lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_105682] a 7-cm surface coil tuned to 1H-MRS frequency of 170.[ADDRESS_117292] de Graaf, which 
will be verified regarding local power deposition using RF simulations. The 7T studies will 
be exploratory.
Session C: NMR  spectroscopy  with 13C/ 2H -tracer infusion (Magnetic Resonance 
Research Center)
Non-diabetic control subjects will be asked to remain fasting  from midnight prior to the 
study. Upon arrival  to the MRRC, their blood  glucose will be checked and an IV catheter 
will be inserted for infusion of insulin  and glucose to maintain normal glucose levels and 
the study  will ensue as described  below.
For type 1 diabetic subjects receiving insulin  via an insulin pump , they will be asked to 
check their blood glucose at home  before  bed and on awakening to ensure  that the 
glucose level is above 70mg/dl and below 200mg/dl. They will be instructed to call [CONTACT_105754] with any readings outside  of this range. Upon  arrival to the MRRC, their blood 
glucose will be checked as a safeguard, and insulin received  via the insulin pump will be 
held. An IV catheter will be inserted for infusion of insulin  and glucose  to maintain normal 
glucose levels and the study will ensue as described below.
For type 1 diabetic subjects using multiple  injections of insulin per day will be asked to 
ensure that the glucose level is above  70mg/dl and below 200mg/dl. As a safeguard, they

awakening. Upon  arrival to 
the MRRC, their blood 
glucose will be checked; a 
nurse will place  an 
intravenous (IV) line to start 
infusions of glucose and 
insulin to maintain normal 
glucose levels.
At 9:[ADDRESS_117293] IV 
catheter will be inserted and 
used to deliver a continuous
insulin infusion  (2mU/kg/min)  and a variable  infusion of 20% dextrose. In addition a 
second IV line will be placed  in the opposite arm to receive a normal saline solution and 
provide access for obtaining blood  samples.
Once subjects arrive in the MR center they will be brought to a hypoglycemic state. The 
plasma glucose level will be gently  lowered  to 50  3 mg/dL (see blood draw  schedule 
below).
Once hypoglycemia is achieved  tracer will be administered (see Figure above). 
Depending on the cohort assignment this will involve one of the following  infusions:
a)A 200mmol/l 13C /2H- alternate  substrate infusion, which will be delivered through  
a port in the already-established IV site at a rate of 22µM/kg/min.
or
b)A 20% [1-13C]/ [2H]-glucose infusion  at 
the same rate as the 20% unlabeled  
glucose infusion that is part of the 
ongoing    hyperinsulinemic     clamp.  
This ‘clamp glucose’ infusion will be held 
for the duration of the 13C/ 2H -glucose  
tracer infusion. In addition to the 13C/ 2H
-glucose infusion subjects will receive a 
simultaneous infusion of unlabeled 
350mM lactate (see adjacent Figure).
Subjects will be moved  into the scanner for
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies. During the spectroscopy  studies,

obtained for localization purposes.  From the image, a 48 cubic centimeter volume in the 
medical occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-parietal  lobe will be selected to obtain localized 13C/2H MRS spectra. 
The Bo homogeneity  in the selected  volume  will be reduced to less than 0.08 ppm using 
automated shimming. Following shimming,  localized MRS  will be performed to the steady  
state 13C/2H-concentrations and fractional enrichments of 13C/2H-tracer, and the 2, 3, and 
4 positions of aspartate, glutamate, and glutamine. Throughout the study, samples  of 
plasma will be obtained for measurement  of glucose, insulin, ketones, lactate, 13C 
enrichment metabolites,  and counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], cortisol). (See  sample collection table Appendix A.) In addition, 
autonomic and neuroglycopenic  symptoms will be assessed.
When the study is completed, subjects will receive a bolus and infusion of 10% dextrose 
to restore  normoglycemia; they will then return  to the HRU, where they will eat lunch. 
Once each subject  appears clinically  well with stable blood glucose  levels  above  70 
mg/dL for at least 60 minutes,  the IV cannula  can be removed and providing they are 
considered stable by [CONTACT_5989],  they can be discharged from the HRU.
Session D: Hyperinsulinemic  Clamp with Cognitive  Testing (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30272])
Non-diabetic control subjects will be asked to remain fasting  from midnight prior to the 
study. Upon arrival  to the HRU, their blood glucose will be checked and an IV catheter 
will be inserted for infusion of insulin  and glucose to maintain normal glucose levels and 
the study  will ensue as described  below.
For type 1 diabetic subjects receiving insulin  via an insulin  pump  will be asked to 
decrease their basal  insulin rate by ~15% at [ADDRESS_117295], they will be asked to check their blood glucose  at home before bed and on 
awakening to ensure that the glucose  level is above 70mg/dl  and below 200mg/dl. They 
will be instructed  to call [CONTACT_105755] with any readings outside of this range. Upon arrival

deliver a continuous insulin infusion  (2mU/kg/min)  and a variable infusion  of 20% 
dextrose. In addition a second  IV line will be placed in the opposite arm to receive a 
normal saline solution  and provide access for obtaining blood samples. During the clamp 
procedure the plasma glucose level will be gently lowered from the initial level of 95- 
100mg/dl to the target of 50  3 mg/dL.
Once a stable glycemic state  is reached,  subjects will receive a bolus-continuous infusion 
of 40µmol/min/kg unlabeled BHB for 5 min followed by a 12µmol/min/kg of BHB or 
infusion of a comparable volume  of normal saline to control for possible volume effects 
for the remainder of the study.
Then a cognitive  testing battery is administered  via questionnaire as done by [CONTACT_105724] (HIC#[PHONE_2415]; PI: R. Sherwin).  Tests of non-memory function  included digit

6.Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design.
Sample size calculations were performed using PASS 2002 (Hintze J. 2001. NCSS and 
PASS Number Cruncher Statistical Systems. Kaysville, Utah.).  In our preliminary 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments (see preliminary studies), under 
hypoglycemic conditions, we observed  significantly greater fractions  of glial oxidative 
metabolism supplied by [CONTACT_105725] T1DM subjects compared to non-diabetic controls 
(0.19  0.066 vs 0.10  0.020; a 90% increase in diabetics compared to controls).  We will 
expect differences between severe  hypoglycemia unaware and control subjects  in this 
study to be on a similar  scale.  With a pooled standard deviation of 0.033, our proposed 
sample sizes  (17 diabetic subjects  and 17 non-diabetic controls) will provide 80% power 
at the two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_117298] differences  of 0.033 between  diabetic 
subjects and non-diabetic controls representing  a 33% increase from non-diabetic  
subjects. In short, we should easily  have sufficient numbers  of to address our primary  
endpoint of enhanced ketone body  uptake  and metabolism following recurrent 
hypoglycemia. Using this data, our proposed  sample sizes of 17 subjects per group will 
provide >80% power to detect a 20% difference in the severe hypoglycemia unaware 
compared to each control group.  We anticipate the changes  seen will be much greater 
than that. Because  small  effects cannot be detected with sufficient  power, conclusions 
based on failure to reject the null hypothesis  will be avoided.

17The same group size considerations apply to the cohorts studied  with glucose/lactate co- 
infusions and the cognitive performance analysis under ketone infusion outside of the 
MRI scanners.
Data analysis will be performed  using SAS statistical software version 8.2. Prior to the 
fundamental analysis,  all data will be appropriately screened for accuracy, missing  data, 
outliers and agreement  with assumptions for the analyses. Univariate  descriptive 
statistics and plots will first be employed  to determine out-of-range values  as well as 
plausible means and standard  deviations.  Non-normal variables  will be identified through 
the inspection of normal  probability plots and with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If 
required, appropriate transformations or non-parametric tests  will be applied to variables 
in violation of the model assumptions.  James  Dziura, Ph.D., the GCRC biostatistician, is 
available for advice  in data analysis.
To test the hypothesis that patients  with hypoglycemia  unawareness exhibit  enhanced  
CNS ketone body  metabolism we will assess brain beta-hydroxybutyrate transport  and 
its absolute levels and the ratio of brain beta-hydroxybutyrate  contribution  to the neuronal  
and astroglial  TCA cycle. In addition,  we will determine the absolute concentration of brain 
neurotransmitter levels using proton  NMR. Group comparisons will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_6484]  (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Data will be tested  for multisample 
sphericity using Mauchly’s  and Box tests. If the assumption of homogenous covariance 
matrices is violated a covariance  pattern  model will be employed to allow  for separate 
sets of covariance parameters for type 1 diabetic vs. nondiabetic controls.  Evaluation of 
a significant diagnosis  by [CONTACT_105726] t-tests (for within and between  subjects factors respectively), using the 
interaction variance term from the ANOVA with a Holm correction  for multiple testing.
7.Subject classification: Check off all classifications of subjects that will be targeted for enrollment in  the 
research project. Will subjects who may require additional safeguards or  other considerations be enrolled in  the 
study? If  so, identify the population of subjects requiring special safeguards and provide a  justification  for their 
involvement.

8.Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: What are the criteria used to determine subject  inclusion or exclusion?
Inclusion criteria  for subjects:
1.Type 1 diabetes mellitus of > 5 years  (C-peptide negative  age 18-60  years, on 
intensive insulin therapy (HbA1c <7.5%)
2.Non-diabetic volunteers, age 18-65  years that do  not meet any of  the exclusion

18The following criteria will exclude subjects from study:
1.Pregnancy
2.Significant  baseline  anemia (hemoglobin <11.0 or hematocrit <  33%)
3.A history of liver cirrhosis or porto-caval shunt surgery.
4.Any contraindications for MRI scanning.
5.Subjects that follow a vegetarian diet
6.Subjects that exercise heavily  on a regular basis (i.e. marathon runners)
7.Subjects with a history  of anxiety/ panic attacks
9.How will eligibility be determined, and by [CONTACT_20898]?
Eligibility to participate  in the study  will be determined by [CONTACT_105727], MD. 
Eligibility will be determined based  on information collected at  the screening visit after 
consent is obtained. This will include findings from physical examination, medical 
history, EKG, and laboratory testing in accordance with the inclusion  and exclusion 
criteria listed  above.
10.Risks: Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject  privacy, discomforts,  or 
inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research.
10.1.Intravenous catheters. The placement of intravenous  catheters  and/or the use of 
intravenous infusions  can result  in local hematoma formation or thrombophlebitis. 
Transient vasovagal symptoms including  nausea, sweating, and lightheadedness 
may also occur  during intravenous  catheter placement.
10.2.Blood sampling. Same as above and frequent blood sampling may result in a drop 
in hematocrit.
10.3.Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic  clamp technique. The hyperinsulinemic 
hypoglycemic clamp  technique  can result  in hypoglycemia  symptoms of varying 
severity. Subjects  may experience autonomic symptoms including hunger,  anxiety, 
tremor, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], and/or diaphoresis. Others  may experience  fatigue, 
concentration difficulties, and/or mild confusion.  The risk of plasma glucose levels  
falling below the target value of 50 ± 3 mg/dL is small  but present;  affected patients 
may experience exaggerated  symptoms, as well as the development  of dizziness,  
blurred vision, and/or confusion. All such  symptoms would be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_105684].
10.4.Infusion of lactate.  In some  subjects with severe panic disorder lactate infusions at 
a lever  higher than proposed  here for MR purposes can precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047]  a panic attack. 
In healthy subjects without panic attacks lactate infusion  is not known  to induce such  
attacks. For this reason we are screening potential study subjects for a past medical  
history of panic  attacks and they will be excluded from participation in our study.

19Administration (FDA)  has set guidelines for magnet strength and exposure to radio 
waves, and we carefully observe  those guidelines.
The Subject will be watched  closely  throughout the MR study. Physiological  
monitoring will be done,  including  O2 saturation, pulse rate and blood pressure. 
Some subjects may feel uncomfortable or anxious. If this happens  to the subject,  
the subject may ask the study  nurse that is present in the scanner room  to stop the 
study at any time and the MR staff will take the subject out of the MR scanner. On 
rare occasions, some subjects might  feel dizzy, get an upset stomach, have a 
metallic taste or feel tingling sensations or muscle twitches.  These sensations 
usually go away quickly however the subject  will be instructed to please  tell the 
research staff if they experience them.  [CONTACT_105755], who has admitting  privileges  at 
YNHH will be available  by [CONTACT_105728] a study.
There are some risks with an MR study for certain people. If the subject has a 
pacemaker or some  metal objects inside their body, the subject may not be in this 
study because the strong magnets  in the MR scanner might harm them. Another risk 
is a metallic object  flying  through the air toward  the magnet and hitting the subject. 
To reduce  this risk the MR staff requires that all people involved  with the study 
remove all metal from their clothing and all metal objects from their pockets. Nothing 
metal can be brought  into the magnet  room at any time. Subjects will walk through  
a ferromagnetic  detector.  Also, once the subject is in the magnet,  the door to the 
room will be closed  so that no one from outside  accidentally goes near the magnet.
The MR staff want the subject to read and answer very carefully  the questions on 
the MR Safety Questionnaire related to the subject’s personal safety.  The subject 
will be asked to take a moment,  to be sure that they have read the MR Safety 
Questionnaire and be sure to tell the MR staff any information they think  might be 
important.
This MR study is for research purposes only and is not in any way a clinical 
examination. The scans performed in this study  are not designed  to find 
abnormalities. The primary investigator,  the lab, the MR technologist, and the 
Magnetic Resonance Research Center are not qualified to interpret the MR scans  
and are not responsible for providing a diagnostic  evaluation  of the images. If a 
worrisome finding  is seen on the subject’s  scan, a radiologist or another physician  
will be asked to review the relevant  images. Based on his or her recommendation (if 
any), the primary investigator or consulting  physician will contact  [CONTACT_423], inform 
the subject  of the finding,  and recommend that the subject seek  medical advice  as 
a precautionary measure. The decision for additional examination or treatment 
would lie solely with the subject and the subject’s  physician. The investigators, the 
consulting physician, the Magnetic  Resonance Research Center, and Yale 
University are not responsible for any examination or treatment that the subject 
receive based on these  findings. The images  collected in this study are not a clinical  
MR exam and for that reason,  they will not be made  available  for diagnostic 
purposes.

2010.6 Stable  isotope infusions: 13C/2H –labeled alternate  energy  substrates  or 13C/2H-
glucose. Carbon-13 and 2H (deuterium) are stable  isotopes of naturally occurring 
substances (carbon12 and hydrogen,  respectively). 2H has been used as 
metabolic tracer in the early days of in vivo MRS, but was never as popular as 13C 
approaches. Recent technical developments have motivated us to explore the 
usefulness of 2H in metabolic imaging. There are no known  side effects are 
associated with the administration of the labeled substrates acetate, BHB and 
lactate or glucose, all of which have been  used by [CONTACT_105729]. The MRRC has extensive experience with stable isotope  
infusions including acetate,  BHB, glucose  and lactate  (HIC # [ZIP_CODE], Rothman PI))

after the glucose infusion. The investigators  in this protocol pi[INVESTIGATOR_105686] 1988.  Studies of brain metabolism  using stable  
isotope infusion in the MRC have been performed since 1990. To date there have been 
no patient injuries  during these  studies and only minor adverse incidences (anxiety, IV 
irritation).
To confront the specific risks listed above:
11.1Intravenous catheters will be placed under sterile conditions by [CONTACT_105731]. All infused  solutions will be prepared in sterile form by [CONTACT_105732]. During 
dextrose infusions, 20% dextrose  will be used to reduce the risk of thrombophlebitis 
normally associated  with the use of excessively hypertonic glucose solutions.
11.2No subject  with a hematocrit less than 37% for males and less than 33% for females 
will be studied. All subjects having donated blood within  30 days of the study will be 
asked to postpone study  participation  (with  a repeat blood  count prior to future  
enrollment), and patients  will be advised to refrain  from blood donation for [ADDRESS_117299]  with a history  of panic attacks will be enrolled in our study.  To identify

2111.5To avoid excess hypoglycemia during  the hyperinsulinemic clamp, plasma glucose 
will be checked every  five minutes using a bedside glucose  monitor.  Based on these 
measurements, the plasma glucose  will be adjusted via the D20 infusion.
11.6All potential study subjects will also be screened for MR safety  using the standard 
MR safety protocol developed by [CONTACT_105733][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Diagnostic  Imaging 
department. Subjects with claustrophobia or with contraindications to MR scanning 
will be excluded from the study. The MR safety screening process will be performed 
both during  the screening interview and on the day  of an MR study.
11.7To reduce  MRI risks we require  that all people involved with the study  remove all 
metal from their clothing and all metal objects from their pockets. Nothing  metal can 
be brought  into the magnet room at any time. Subjects will also walk through a 
ferromagnetic detector. Also, once subjects are in the magnet,  the door to the room 
will be closed so that no one from outside accidentally  goes near the magnet.  In 
addition, patients can stop study  at any time if anxiety is a significant issue.
11.8To reduce  the risk of injury  in the MRI scanner, subjects  will go through a 
ferromagnetic metal  detector,  to prevent any metal objects  being taken into the

the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will  make the final determination of  the risk to  
subjects.) For  more  information, see the  Instructions, page 24.
a. What  is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating  in this 
study?
Moderate
b. If children  are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the 
children participating  in this study?
N/A
c. Copy,  paste, and  then  tailor an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
from http://www.yale.edu/hrpp/forms-templates/biomedical.html for
i.Minimal risk
ii.Greater than minimal/moderate risk
iii.High risk
The risks associated with the current study are deemed moderate for the following 
reasons:
We do not view the risks associated with the combined use of insulin and dextrose as 
minimal. Given our experience with the combined co-administration of insulin  and 
dextrose, we do not view the proposed studies as high risk.
Although we have  assessed the proposed study as one of moderate risk, the potential 
exists for anticipated and/or unanticipated  adverse events,  serious or otherwise, to occur 
since it is not possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or 
in advance of first-hand  experience with the proposed  study methods.
Therefore, we provide  a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as 
follows:
Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored  for each subject participating in the study  and 
attributed to the study procedures / design by [CONTACT_458]  [INVESTIGATOR_105688]:
a.) Definite: Adverse  event is clearly related to investigational  procedures. 
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely  related  to investigational procedures. 
c.) Possible: Adverse  event may be related  to investigational procedures.
d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational 
procedures.
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly  not related to  investigational procedures.
Plan for Grading  Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading  the severity of adverse  events noted during 
the study:
1.Mild adverse event
2.Moderate adverse event
3.Severe
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/4/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 3/4/2021HIC#[PHONE_2413]
23Plan for Determining  Seriousness of Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse Events:
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_105689] a Serious  Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse  event is considered  
serious if it:
1.is life-threatening
2.results in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105690]
3.results in persistent  or significant disability or incapacity
4.results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect OR
5.results in death
6.based upon appropriate medical  judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health 
and may require  medical or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition,  or
7.adversely affects the risk/benefit  ratio of the study
An adverse event  may be graded as severe  but still not meet  the criteria  for a Serious 
Adverse Event. Similarly,  an adverse event may be graded  as moderate but still meet the 
criteria for an SAE. It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_30269] “seriousness” when determining whether reporting to  the HIC or HSC is necessary.
Plan for reporting serious AND unanticipated AND  related  adverse  events,  
anticipated adverse  events occurring at a greater frequency than expected, and 
other unanticipated problems  involving risks to subjects or others to the HIC or 
HSC.
13.The investigator will report  the following types of adverse  events to the HIC  or  HSC:
a)serious  AND unanticipated  AND possibly,  probably or definitely  related events;
b)anticipated adverse events occurring with a greater frequency than expected; and
c)other unanticipated problems involving  risks to subjects or others.
These adverse events or unanticipated  problems involving risks to subjects  or others will 
be reported to the HIC or HSC within  48 hours of it becoming  known to the investigator, 
using the appropriate  forms found on the website.
Plan for reporting adverse events  to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate 
the protocol’s research monitor(s),  e.g., industrial sponsor, Yale Center  for Clinical 
Investigation Research Subject Advocates (RSAs),  Cancer Center's Quality  
Assurance, Compliance and Safety Committee (QUACS) Protocol Review 
Committee (PRC), DSMBs,  study sponsors, funding and regulatory agencies, and 
regulatory and decision-making  bodies.
For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory 
agencies will be notified (choose  those that apply):

12.Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design.
Sample size calculations were  performed  using  PASS  2002 (Hintze  J. 2001. NCSS  and 
PASS Number  Cruncher Statistical  Systems. Kaysville, Utah.). In our preliminary 
magnetic resonance  spectroscopy experiments (see preliminary studies), under  
hypoglycemic conditions, we observed significantly greater fractions of glial oxidative 
metabolism supplied by [CONTACT_105737] T1DM subjects compared  to nondiabetic controls (0.19
 0.066 vs 0.10  0.020; a 90% increase  in diabetics compared to controls).  We will expect 
differences between severe hypoglycemia unaware and control subjects  in this study to 
be on a similar scale. With a pooled standard  deviation of 0.033,  our proposed  sample  
sizes (17 diabetic subjects and 17 nondiabetic controls) will provide 80% power at the 
two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_117301] differences of 0.033 between diabetic  subjects  
and nondiabetic  controls representing a 33% increase from nondiabetic subjects. In short, 
we should  easily have  sufficient numbers of to address  our primary  endpoint of enhanced  
ketone body uptake and metabolism following  recurrent  hypoglycemia. Using this data, 
our proposed sample  sizes of 17 subjects per group will provide >80% power  to detect  a 
20% difference in the severe hypoglycemia unaware compared to each control  group. 
We anticipate the changes seen will be much greater than that. Because small effects 
cannot be detected with sufficient  power, conclusions based  on failure  to reject the null 
hypothesis will be avoided.
Data analysis  will be performed using SAS statistical software version 8.2. Prior to the 
fundamental analysis, all data will be appropriately screened for accuracy,  missing data, 
outliers and agreement with assumptions  for the analyses. Univariate descriptive 
statistics and plots will first be employed to determine out-of-range  values as well as 
plausible means and standard  deviations. Non-normal variables  will be identified through  
the inspection  of normal probability plots and with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If 
required, appropriate  transformations  or non-parametric tests will be applied to variables 
in violation of the model assumptions. James Dziura, Ph.D., the GCRC biostatistician, is 
available for advice  in data analysis.
To test the hypothesis that patients with hypoglycemia unawareness exhibit enhanced 
CNS alternate  fuel metabolism we will assess brain beta-hydroxybutyrate transport and 
its absolute levels and the ratio of brain alternate fuel contribution  to the neuronal and 
astroglial TCA cycle.  In addition, we will determine the absolute concentration  of brain

35SECTION X: RESEARCH A LTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC  CONSIDERATIONSStudy subjects  will derive no direct medical  benefits from the study. However,  the 
potential benefits of this study  to society at large,  and to the T1DM  population in particular,  
are substantial in that the knowledge gained from this work should provide important 
information concerning  the effects  of recurrent, antecedent hypoglycemia on CNS 
responses to hypoglycemia.  This information could contribute significantly to clinical  
indications and patient selection for the islet transplantation procedure.
1. Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects  outside of  the research?
No alternative treatments are available.
2. Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to 
subjects, the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation.
Subjects assigned to Cohort 1 will receive a total of $350 for participating  in the study 
($[ADDRESS_117312] scan  and $300  for completion of the second scan). 
Subjects assigned to Cohort 2,3 and 5 will receive  $300  for completing the study. 
Subjects assigned to Cohort 4 will be paid $[ADDRESS_117313] using the Yale electronic 
payment service. 
3. Costs for Participation  (Economic Considerations):  Clearly describe the subject’s costs associated with 
participation in the  research, and the interventions or procedures of the study  that will be provided at  no cost 
to subjects.
Subjects will not be responsible for any costs associated with the study  or the screening 
portion prior to the study, including blood work, history and physical examination,  or urine 
pregnancy test. We believe that given the length and number of procedures  performed,  
the remuneration is fair and is not an excessive inducement for people to volunteer  for 
the study.
4. In Case of Injury: This section is required  for any research involving more than minimal  risk.
a.Will medical treatment be  available if research-related injury occurs?
b.Where and from whom may treatment be obtained?
c.Are there any limits  to the  treatment being  provided?
d.Who will pay  for this treatment?
e.How will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]?
If injury were to occur, we will provide any care of treatment required. Our study has  no 
provision for additional compensation.  While participating  in the study procedures the 
overseeing physician, [CONTACT_105755]  or one of his designated co-investigators will be 
responsible for providing  treatment. If necessary and the treatment requirement exceeds  
what can be provided  at the study  site, the participant will be transferred to the YNHH  
Emergency Department for further care. The participant’s insurance will be billed for the

Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 of 64  2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most commonly encountered aneurysm of the 
arterial system.  Several factors are thought to contribute to the development of AAA such 
as advanced age, gender, family history of AAA, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
hypertension, smoking, connective tissue disorders and atherosclerotic disease.  Males are affected by [CONTACT_423239].   
The presentation of AAA usually depends upon whether complications or symptoms have occurred.  Fortunately, the rate of detecting and diagnosing AAA has increased in recent 
years.  Improved imaging techniques and public screening programs for the aging population have contributed to this increase
1, and many asymptomatic patients are 
diagnosed w ith AAA upon routine examination by a physician for another problem or as a 
result of increased patient awareness.  Symptoms such as acute onset of abdominal, back, or flank pain can be an indication of aneurysm expansion or impending rupture which may follow at a time that is unpredictable.  Rupture of AAA is a life -threatening clinical event 
necessitating emergent intervention.  Many patients with ruptured AAA die before reaching the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Of the patients that do reach the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], about half of those patients survive.   
The overall objective in treating AAA is to prevent rupture and subsequent death.  The 
natural history of untreated AAA is to progressively enlarge and consequently rupture.  Although it is difficult to predict, it is generally accep ted that the greater the diameter of a  
AAA, the greater the risk of rupture.  According to a study of 300 patients over a 6- year 
time period, Guirguis et al
2  determined that the risk of  rupture with a AAA diameter less 
than 5.0 cm is significantly lower than the risk of rupture of AAA with a diameter of 5.0 cm or more.  Brewster et al
3 reported the risk of rupture for females having a 5 cm diameter 
AAA is equivalent to that of a male having a 6  cm diameter AAA.  
2.1 Conventional Treatment of Abdominal Aorti c Aneurysm  
The current (standard) treatments for abdominal aortic aneurysms include “watchful waiting,” surgical repair of the aorta using a fabric substitute, and endovascular repair of the aorta. 
2.1.[ADDRESS_1204994] , 
MRI, or ultrasound every 6 months to assess changes in the size or shape of the aneurysm.  
This method is usually used for aneurysms that are smaller than 5 cm in diameter.  
If the AAA is large, grows qui ckly, or is causing symptoms, it will require prompt treatment 
to prevent rupture.  Available treatments for AAA requiring intervention are open surgical 
aneurysm repair and endovascular stent graft repair.  
2.1.2  Open Surgical Repair Until the early 1990’s, open surgical repair was the only standard treatment for AAA  
requiring intervention.  Significant inherent mortality and morbidity risks are associated 
with open surgical repair due to the invasive nature of this surgery.  The standard surgical procedure involves resection of the diseased segment of the aorta and replacement with a 
synthetic graft.  This surgical technique necessitates general anesthesia, aortic cross -
clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and results in significant blood loss with associated transfusions.   
Ovation Alto™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- [ADDRESS_1204995] several decades4.  The rate of early operative mortality for open surgical repair 
varies greatly, (between 3 -6 %) throughout the published literature.  The Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA) reported early mortality rates in population -based series for elective 
open surgical repair were between 3 -5% at 30 days1.  In a literature review by [CONTACT_423240]5, the 
mortality rate for elective surgical repair was noted to be  approximately 5%, and 
approximately 50% for emergent surgical repair.   
The following outlines morbidities associated with elective conventional surgery. 
Complication  Range Average*  
All Cardiac (includes myocardial infarction, 
congestive heart failure, and new cardiac 
arrhythmias)  0.8 – 21% 12% 
Pulmonary (includes pneumonia and pulmonary 
insufficiency, does not include atelectasis)  0 – 23% 8.4% 
Renal Failure (chronic and acute)  0 – 9% 4.2% 
Cerebrovascular Accident  0 – 11% 1.9% 
Paraplegia or Paraparesis  0 – 0.6% <0.1% 
Vascular 0 – 5.7% 1.1% 
Thrombotic/embolic  0 – 5.0% 1.8% 
Gastrointestinal  0 – 14% 4.2% 
Impotence  0 – 1.8% 0.2% 
Hematoma  0 – 1.8% 0.2% 
Bleeding/coagulopathy  0 – 44% 5.9% 
Wound healing/infection  0 – 7.1% 2.2% 
*Averages are unweighted from a review of the literature listed in Appendix II. 
2.1.3  Endovascular Stent Graft Repair 
Since the early 1990’s, endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has evolved into the  treatment 
for AAA at most centers .  In 1991, [CONTACT_864212] was one of the first to introduce EVAR 
as a less invasive treatment option for AAA .  Since that time, systems for performing 
endovascular repair of AAA have been developed, improved upon, clinically tested, and 
approved by [CONTACT_240993].  The availability of this less invasive technique allows the treatment of patients with multiple comorbidities  who may have otherwise been 
excluded from treatment with open repair due to high surgical risk
7. 
 
Endovascular grafts, often stented for support, are designed to provide an alternate conduit for blood flow and to exclude the aneurysm from this flow and the associated 
hemodynamic pressure.  Exclusion of the aneurysm significantly reduce s its potential f or 
rupture.  
Ovation Alto™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- [ADDRESS_1204996] been developed, clinically 
tested, and approved for use.  The Ovation platform is approved for commercial use in 
approximately  40 geographies, including the [LOCATION_002], Europe and Canada. In 
addition, there are several devices  (Excluder, Zenith, AFX, Powerlink, Talent, AneuRx, 
Endurant, Endurant II, Aorfix  and Ancure ) approved for use in the [LOCATION_002], with 
some also approved in other worldwide geographies.  In a multi- center AAA clinical trial evaluation of open versus endovascular treatment, 
Matsumura
6 reports the rates of major adverse events were significantly lower in the 
endovascular group (14%) than those in the control group (57%).  Patients in the endovascular treatment group also experienced less blood loss, a reduction in need for 
transfusions and a shorter length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  The following outlines morbidities associated with EVAR: 
Complication  Range Average*  
All Cardiac (includes myocardial infarction, 
congestive heart failure, and new cardiac 
arrhythmias)  0 – 12% 4.9% 
Pulmonary (includes pneumonia and pulmonary 
insufficiency, does not include atelectasis)  0 – 7.7% 2.6% 
Renal Failure (chronic and acute)  0 – 6.5% 3.0% 
Cerebrovascular Accident  0 – 2.8% 0.3% 
Paraplegia or Paraparesis  0 – 0.2% <0.1% 
Access/Deployment Failure  0 – 11% 5.0%

Vascular 0 – 14% 5.1% 
Thrombotic/embolic  0.9 – 18% 7.7% 
Gastrointestinal  0 – 4.8% 1.4%

Ovation Alto™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 64  The literature demonstrates mortality rates for EVAR to be 0–7.5%, with 3.4% as the 
average.  This rate is inflated, to some extent, by [CONTACT_864171].  For systemic morbidities (cardiac, 
pulmonary, renal, cerebrovascular, and gastrointestinal), the rates for EVAR appear to be 
lower than for surgical repair.  The statistical significance of this observation, however, has not been assessed.  
Less blood loss, fewer days in the ICU, and a shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864143]. 
On average, patients treated with EVAR are also able to return to their normal activities 
quicker than those who receive open surgery.

Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 64  4.0 DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
The Ovation Alto Abdominal Stent Graft System is an endovascular device delivered via 
a low-profile catheter to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The stent graft is 
designed to reline the diseased vasculature, providing an endovascular blood conduit for 
isolating the aneurysm from the high -pressure flow of blood, thereby [CONTACT_864172]. The stent graft is a modular configuration comprised of an aortic body section, iliac limbs, the balloon expandable stent/delivery system  as required , as well as  iliac 
extensions as required ( Figure 1). 
  
The Ovation Alto  Abdominal Stent Graft System includes: 
• An Aortic Body Stent Graft and delivery catheter  
• Ovation iX Iliac Limb Stent Grafts and delivery catheters * 
• Ovation iX Iliac Extension Stent Grafts and delivery catheters, as required * 
• Balloon Expandable Stent and delivery catheters, as required

Figure 1.  Schematic of Deployed Ovation Alto Abdominal Stent Graft System  
 
The aortic body is comprised of a proximal stent for suprarenal fixation and a low -
permeability  polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE) graft. The stent is designed with integral 
anchors to enable fixation to the aortic wall. For delivery, the stent is in a compressed state 
within the catheter. When released from the compressed state, the stent expands to engage 
the vessel wall. The nitinol stent is radiopaque, and radiopaque markers are located adjacent to the graft proximal edge. These radiopaque markers aid placement of the device 
in its intended location relative to  the renal arteries. To seal the proximal end of the graft 
and to provide support for the aortic body legs into which the iliac limbs are deployed, the graft body contains a network of inflatable rings that are filled with a liquid polymer that 
solidifies during the deployment procedure. The graft has a fill port that connects the fill 
network of the graft to the delivery catheter.   Figure 2 provides an image of the device with 
its sealing ring in the aorta.

Figure 2.        Ovation Alto Aortic Body Stent Graft in aorta  
 
The iliac limbs and extensions are comprised of a nitinol stent encapsulated in low -
permeability PTFE. The iliac limbs are deployed into the leg sections of the aortic body. 
Radiopaque markers enable the physician to visualize the appropriate iliac limb - aortic 
body overlap or iliac extension – iliac limb overlap during a catheter -based deployment. 
Stent radial force provides both fixation and sealing of the interface between the aortic 
body and each il iac limb, between the iliac limb and iliac extension, and between the iliac 
limb/extension and its landing zone in the iliac artery.  
The BES implant is a balloon expandable, closed cell design, laser cut stent made from 
seamless 316L VM stainless steel tub ing.  The implant is supplied in two nominal lengths, 
30mm and 40mm, and is preloaded into a delivery catheter.  The implant is designed to expand to a maximum diameter of 30mm.  The stainless steel stent is inherently radiopaque 
which visually aids the pl acement of the stent graft accessory across  the sealing rings of the 
primary aortic stent graft body as illustrated in Figure 3  below. 

Ovation Alto™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- [ADDRESS_1204997] positioned and the sheath is retracted. The proximal stent is deployed using stent 
release knobs on the handle, with an integral balloon used to facilitate graft opening. The 
fill polymer is then delivered through the fill connector port using the A utoinjector.   
 
The contralateral and ipsilateral iliac limbs are each dep loyed via iliac limb delivery 
catheters. After deployment of the aortic body, a guidewire is placed from the contralateral 
access site into the contralateral distal leg of the aortic body ; the integrated crossover lumen 
on the aortic body delivery system can be utilized to facilitate the process . The contralateral 
iliac limb is advanced into position and deployed into the aortic body leg by [CONTACT_864174]. The contralateral limb delivery 
catheter is then used as an integral sheath (as described above) or withdrawn from the 
vasculature.  

Ovation Alto™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 64   
After the fill polymer cures within the sealing rings, the integral balloon of the aortic body 
delivery catheter can be used to improve seal ring apposition. The catheter is detached from 
the fill port of the graft and is used as an integral sheath (as described above) or  withdrawn 
from the vasculature.  
 The ipsilateral iliac limb delivery catheter is advanced over the ipsilateral guidewire and 
deployed using the  method described above for the contralateral limb. The ipsilateral limb 
delivery catheter is then used as an integral sheath (as described above) or withdrawn from 
the vasculature.  
 
If an iliac extension is required, the delivery system is advanced over the guidewire and 
deployed using the method described above for contralateral and ipsilateral iliac limbs. 
If a balloon expandable stent is required (after removal of the aortic body delivery system), 
the stent is first positioned across the sealing ring a nd secondary ring of the previously 
deployed aortic body stent graft and the sheath is retracted. After sheath retraction, the stent is expanded by [CONTACT_864175]. The balloon is then deflated and the delivery 
catheter is withdrawn from the vasculature.

6.11 Adverse Events  
An adverse event is any new, undesirable medical occurrence or change (worsening) of a 
pre-existing condition that occurs in a subject, whether or not considered to be associated 
with the product.  Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31643] -existing conditions (e.g., elective 
cosmetic procedures) are not adverse events. The following events are to be captured in 
this study:  
 
• Adverse Events, regardless of device relationship 
• Serious Adverse Events, regardless of device relationship 
• All Deaths  
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
  Requirements for reporting AEs are dependent upon the reviewing IRB/EC policy.  
Adverse events will be reviewed by a Clinical Events Committee (CEC).  The CEC will meet periodically, a minimum of annually.  Adverse Event information is recorded in the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 For purposes of this study, the following events are not considered adverse events, because they are expected to occur in conjunction with the index procedure or are associated with subjects undergoing customary, standard of care endovascular AAA 
repair procedures:  
• Early post-operative pain (within 24 hours of index procedure) at the access site 
and/or related to position on procedure table 
• Post-anesthesia/conscious sedation emesis, nausea, or headache (within 24 hours of index procedure) 
• Electrolyte imbalance without clinical sequelae following index procedure, even if requiring correction  
• Low grade temperature increase (< 101.0 °F)  
• Hematocrit decrease from baseline of less than 6 points (2 grams of hemoglobin) 
that remains above 30% and is not associated with hemodynamic changes and 
does not require transfusion 
• Blood loss not requiring transfusion and not resulting in decreased hematocrit. 
Ovation Alto™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 64  • Minor, localized tenderness, swelling, induration, bruising, erythema, hematoma 
etc. at vascular access site that does not require surgical intervention, evacuation, 
transfusion, or antibiotics 
• Prophylactic administration of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
• Prophylactic pacing  
• Isolated, non-sustained PVCs/PACs 
• Non-sustained, arrhythmia  not requiring treatment or intervention 
• Hypotension or hypertension not requiring treatment or intervention 
• Atelectasis not requiring treatment  
• Prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864150] a skilled 
nursing facility , care facility, rehabilitation center, etc.  
The Investigator and/or IRB/EC may require that these events are reported as adverse 
events.  In this case, the Investigator should report these observations based on their 
medical judgment and requirements of the IRB/EC. 
 Device-related adverse events should be reported to the study Sponsor as soon as 
possible (24 hours recommended), but no more than 10 working days after the date 
the site becomes aware of the event.  
Device-Related: Event is caused or contributed by [CONTACT_864188], deployment or while the device is in situ post- operatively  
• “Caused or Contributed” means that an injury was or may have been 
attributed to the study device, or that the study device was or may have been a 
factor in an injury, including events occurring as a result of:  
o Any event resulting from intervention on the AAA or device 
o Any device failure, malfunction, inadequacy, including operator error 
Procedure- Related: Event is caused or contributed by [CONTACT_864189] (index) procedure, up to 30 days, unless a different etiology can be identified  
6.12 Serious Adverse Events  (SAE) 
A serious adverse event (SAE) defined as one that suggests a significant hazard or side effect, regardless of the investigator or Sponsor’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_864151].  This includes, but may not be limited to, any event that: 
• Is fatal 
• Is life-threatening  
• Requires or prolongs  (>48 hours) inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Is a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is considered an important medical event* 
 *Important medical events may be considered serious by [CONTACT_864190][INVESTIGATOR_059].  Such 
important medical events are those that may jeopardize the subject, require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or result in urgent investigation.  Examples include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias.   
Ovation Alto™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 64  Serious Adverse Events should be reported to the study Sponsor as soon as possible 
(24 hours recommended), but no more than 10 working days after the date the site 
becomes aware of the event.  
 
Sites are also required to adhere to the reviewing IRB/EC requirements for reporting 
of SAE’s.  
6.13 Major Adverse Events (MAE)  
The following specific events will be considered major adverse events (MAE) for the purpose of evaluating the primary (30 day) and secondary (1 year) safety endpoints:  Major adverse events (MAE) are defined as any one of the following events:  
• Death 
• Myocardial Infarction  
• Stroke (excludes TIA)  
• Renal Failure (excludes renal insufficiency)  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60064] (excludes COPD or pulmonary complications)  
• Paralysis (excludes paraparesis)  
• Bowel Ischemia  
• Procedural Blood Loss (≥1,000 cc) 
 A major adverse event (MAE) may or may not be considered related to the device. Mortality will be reported as “all cause” and “AAA related.” All deaths occurring in the 
first [ADDRESS_1205017]- index procedure are considered “AAA related.”  
 The Clinical Events Committee (CEC) shall determine which adverse events are considered Major Adverse Events (MAE) for evaluation of the primary (30 days) and secondary (1 year) safety endpoints.   
6.[ADDRESS_1205018]  (UADE) 
An unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety 
or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if  that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or 
any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) are to be recorded in the Adverse Event 
eCRF and the event is to be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event.  Sites are also required to adhere to the reviewing IRB/EC requirements 
for reporting of any UADE.

Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 64  8.0 DATA ANALYSIS  
8.1 Analysis Population  
Primary analyses will be performed on a modified  intent-to-treat basis.  The modified 
intent-to-treat group includes all subjects in which the delivery system was inserted into an 
access vessel.  All subjects who achieve technical success and remain free of all other 
elements of the composite effectiveness endpoint at 12 months will be considered treatment successes.  All subjects who fail based on any element of the composite effectiveness endpoint, and all subjects who deemed treatment successes will be included in the denominator.  Only subjects with readable imaging during each respective follow -up 
interval will be included in the denominator for relevant effectiveness endpoints.  Subjects not counted as failures, but w ith incomplete data to assess all the composite elements will 
be treated as missing data points.   
8.2 Analysis Windows 
Safety and effectiveness data will be categorized into discrete, contiguous analysis 
windows to ensure that all available data are included in analyses.  The analysis windows 
around each follow -up visit are: 1 month (0- 90 days), 6 months (91- 304 days), and 12 
months (305-547 days). 
8.[ADDRESS_1205021] of missing data on the primary endpoint.    Complete data analysis methods will be prospectively defined in a Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
8.4 Study Hypotheses  
Treatment success at 12 months in subjects treated with the Ovation Alto will be 
compared to a performance goal of 80%.  
 The primary effectiveness hypotheses are defined as:  
• H
0: π ≤ 80% 
• H1: π > 80%, where 
 
Ovation Alto™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 64  π is the expected treatment success rate at 12 months  in subjects treated with the Ovation 
Alto.  The primary effectiveness endpoint will be met if the lower limit of the one -sided 
95% confidence interval for π is greater than 80%.  
 
Additional outcomes in this study will be reported descriptively, with no hypothesis testing. 
8.5 Power Analysis and Sample Size 
The sample size for this study  was calculated based on the following assumptions: 
• Estimated trea tment success at 12 months: 92.8% 
• Performance goal: 80% 
• Confidence interval estimation: One -sided exact 95% confidence limit  
• Statistical power: 86.1% 
 
The power analysis assumptions are bas ed on the following rationales: 
• Estimated treatment success at 12 months of 92.8% was derived by 
[CONTACT_864192] G090239.  Given the similarities in device attributes and that no impacts on device effectiveness are 
anticipated between IDE G090239 and the current study, it is reasonable to assume the same adjusted treatment success rate observed in  IDE G090239. 
• The performance goal of 80% is a common standard for comparing 12-month 
effectiveness outcomes in EVAR IDE trials.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_864154].  The performance goal may be somewhat more conservative in the current study given the comparatively broader 
definition of 12- month treatment success.  
• A one-sided 95% confidence limit is appropriate since the 12- month treatment 
success rate with the Ovation Alto would not reasonably be expected to be lower than the 80% performance goal.  Therefore, protection against a type I error on that side of the hypothesis is not considered.   
 Based on these assumptions, 60 evaluable patients are required.   In order to account for 
reasonable attrition, the Sponsor plans to enroll up to 75 patients in this study.

Protocol #771- [ADDRESS_1205022].  The mortality risk of open surgical repair of an AAA is gre ater 
for those subjects with significant surgical risk factors, such as age and comorbidities (e.g., cardiac, renal and pulmonary).
1   
 Endovascular treatment of a AAA has been shown to be an effective, less invasive procedure that may result in reduced ea rly mortality and factors related to morbidities, 
reduced time for anesthesia, need for blood products, shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864155], as well as improved quality of life in the early postoperative period.    Risks to subjects are minimized initially by [CONTACT_864193]/institutions with endovascular experience to participate in the study.  In order for patients to participate in this study, they must agree to adhere to a strict follow -up 
schedule to continuously monitor their long term safety.   The risks associated with the use of this study device are not currently known.  Although the adverse events associated with the use of the Ovation Alto Abdominal Stent Graft 
System may be less than for standard open surgical repair, inherent risks exist, as with 
many medical procedures.  However, risks that have been associated with repair of AAAs with this type of device in clinical trials or that are currently marketed include, but may not be limited to:  
• Acute and chronic renal failure, renal microemboli sm, renal insufficiency, renal 
artery occlusion, contrast toxicity;

Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 64  APPENDIX III:  ASA Classification System  
American Society of Anesthesiologists Classification System 
The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) presents a graded scale assessing a 
subject’s risk of undergoing anesthesia.  The scale represents the significance of the subject’s underlying illnesses prior to anesthesia. 
The following provides a description of the four grades of the ASA scale: 
ASA I 
Healthy individual without any systemic disease , undergoing elective surgery.  Subject not 
at extremes of age.  (Note: Age is sometimes ignored as affecting operative risk; however, 
subjects at either extreme of age are thought to represent increased risk.)  Some examples 
are a fit man with an inguinal hernia, and a fibroid uterus in an otherwise healthy woman. ASA II 
Individual with one system, well -controlled disease .  Disease does not affect daily 
activities.  Other anesthetic risk factors, including mild obesity, alcoholism, and smoking 
can be incor porated here.  Examples include non- limiting or only slightly limiting organic 
heart disease, essential hypertension, anemia, or mild diabetes.  
ASA III 
Individual with multiple system disease or well controlled major system disease .  Disease 
does limit daily activities.  No immediate danger of death from any individual disease.  Examples include severe organic heart disease, severe diabetes with vascular complications, moderate to severe degrees of pulmonary insufficiency, angina or healed myocardial infarc tion. 
ASA IV 
Individual in imminent danger of death.  Surgery is viewed to be last resort at salvaging life.  Individual not expected to live through the next 24 hours.  In some cases, the individual may be healthy prior to catastrophic event that led to t he current medical 
condition.  Examples include ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm with profound shock, major cerebral trauma with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_864161], massive pulmonary 
embolus.

WHAT IS INFORMED CONSENT?  
When researchers ask for your consent, they are asking for your voluntary agreement to 
take part in a test, procedure, or clinical research trial.  Informed consent means more than signing a printed consent form.  To be informed, you need to know about benefits and risks of the clinical research trial and how it may affect you, your family, and society.  The following document is called a consent form and describes the clinical research trial and what your role will be as a study participant.  
This consent form may contain words that you do not understand.  Please ask the doctor in charge of the study, your own doctor, or the staff involved with the clinical research trial to explain any words that you do not understand before signing this form.  You may also contact [CONTACT_423269] “Persons To Contact [CONTACT_864204]™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 64  Research Questions” for any questions you may have regarding this research study.  You 
will be given a copy of the signed consent form. 
 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
You have been asked to consider participating in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the 
Ovation Alto Abdominal Stent Graft System, a device used in the treatment of patients 
with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA ).  The clinical trial will enroll up to 75 patients at 
up to 15 U.S. clinical sites.   
An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the aorta (the main artery leaving the heart) 
caused by a weakening in the artery wall.  If left untreated, this bulge may co ntinue to grow 
larger and ultimately rupture (break open), resulting in serious internal bleeding.  The information collected from this study will be used to evaluate how well patients do when treated with the Ovation  Alto Abdominal Stent Graft System both  immediately after 
surgery and over a long period of time.  If you decide to participate in this study, your medical condition will be carefully monitored.  
Treatment of your AAA with the Ovation Alto Abdominal Stent Graft System involves the 
placement of s pecially designed grafts (fabric tubes) in your aorta.  The main graft looks 
like a pair of pants with very short legs.  The top of the pants will be placed in your aorta.  Then, two or more smaller grafts are used to extend from the main graft into your i liac 
arteries (the main arteries supplying blood to your abdomen and legs) to form the legs of the pair of pants.  Each graft is enclosed in a small catheter (a long, flexible tube) that is inserted into your aorta through the femoral artery in your groin (top of your leg).  The grafts are then placed in the correct position in your aorta by [CONTACT_423271].  Once the grafts are attached inside your aorta, they will reinforce the area of your aorta that is weakened and bulging from your aneurysm.  This procedure is called an endovascular aneurysm repair because the grafts are delivered through your blood vessels.   
 
EXPLANATION OF PROCEDURES  
In preparation for this research study, you will have a physical examination by [CONTACT_710919], an evaluation of your medical history and any risk factors, and a check of the blood 
pressures in your arms and legs.  You will also have approximately 2 tablespoons, or 30 milliliters, of blood drawn from a vein using a needle, so that tests of your kidney function 
and your body’s blood- clotting abilities can be performed.  If you are a female with child 
bearing potential, you will also have a blood pregnancy test performed to make sure you are not pregnant. Since your doctor has already diagnosed your aneurysm, you may have already had a special x -ray, called a CT scan.  If you have not had a CT scan, or if the CT 
scan information is not detailed enough to let your doctor evaluate your aneurysm, you will be required to have a CT scan. These same tests would be done if you were scheduled to 
undergo standard surgery to repair your aneurysm or if you were going to have an endovascular AAA repair using another device. 
As the procedure begins, you will receive a drug in your hand or arm to help sedate you, 
or you might receive general anesthesia depending upon your particular circumstance.  
Your surgeon will clean your skin and shave hair around the place where the device will be inserted through a catheter (flexible tube) into your body.  Your surgeon will then ma ke 
Ovation Alto™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 of 64  an incision (cut) into the skin in order to get access to the femoral artery in your groin (top 
of leg). Your surgeon will then thread a very thin wire into your artery to guide it to the aneurysm. Because you have no nerve endings inside your arteries, you will not feel the 
wires or catheters as they move through your body. You may feel a slight pressure or a sensation of mild tugging during this part of the procedure.  
The main catheter containing the first pi[INVESTIGATOR_864164] y our 
femoral artery up to a level in the aorta above the aneurysm, but below the arteries that go 
to your kidneys.  The graft will be released from the catheter and the catheter will be pulled away.  A special material will be inserted into tubes inside the  wall of the main graft to 
ensure it is tight against the artery wall.  Then, catheters are used to place the two or more smaller grafts into your iliac arteries to complete the procedure.  All the catheters will be removed leaving the graft in place insid e your aorta.  The incisions in your groin arteries 
and in your skin will be closed by [CONTACT_4904]. 
After the procedure has been completed and you have had time to recover from the 
sedation, you will be kept in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864165].  Prior to your discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], you will have physical examinations, and you may have 
blood tests that will require approximately 30 millimeters of blood to be drawn.  
 
FOLLOW -UP EVALUATIONS  
If you decide to participate in this researc h study, you will be required to return to your 
doctor for follow -up evaluations at one (1) month, six (6) months, and at one (1) year after 
the procedure.   Additional study follow-up may occur through five (5) years.  Treatment 
with the study device will require lifelong medical follow -up, either after the study is 
completed or subject withdrawal.  
At each of the follow -up visits, you will have a physical exam, CT scan, X-ray (Kidney 
Ureter, Bladder (KUB) ), and may have blood tests that will require approximately [ADDRESS_1205037].    
 
Ovation Alto™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- [ADDRESS_1205038] 
been associated with repair of AAAs with this type of device in clinical trials or that are 
currently marketed include, but may not be limited to: 
• hematoma (deep bruise) or lymphatic problems (infection) at the access sites in 
the groin;  
• damage to the iliac or femoral arteries during device deployment;  
• fracture of the metallic components of the implant; 
• endoleak (leakage of blood around the graft into the aneurysm sac and/or blood 
flow into the aneurysm sac from vessels connected to the aorta); 
• continued enlargement of your aneurysm; 
• failure to deploy the graft resulting in the need to stop the procedure and/or 
convert to open surgical repair;  
• twisting of the implanted graft;  
• migration of the some or all of the device parts;  
• separation of implant parts; 
• aortic occlusion (blockage or the blood flow in your aorta) from blood clots;  
• kinking or twisting of the graft and iliac artery occlusion (blockage of blood flow 
in the blood vessels that supply blood to your legs) from blood clots, kinking or 
twisting of the legs of the graft; and  
• allergic reaction to the device fill material, if injected into the bloodstream, as 
well as device materials.  
Complications common to all patients undergoing standard surgical aneurysm repair or 
endovascular repair include, but may not be limited to:  
• allergic reaction to x -ray contrast dye;  
• procedural bleeding; 
• post-procedure bleeding;  
• hematoma (deep br uise);  
• bleeding disorders;  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399];  
• pneumonia;  
• pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lung);  
• myocardial infarction;  
• congestive heart failure;  
• irregular heart beat requiring therapy;  
• kidney failure; wound infection;  
• bowel complications such as paralysis of the bowel; blockage of the bowel; or decreased blood flow to the bowel tissue; 
• liver failure;  
• neoplasm; 
• mild or severe blockage of blood flow to your legs or arms due to blood clots or damage to the blood vessels;  
• amputation;  
• nerve injury; paraplegia, paraparesis, paralysis 
• stroke;  
• urinary complications such as incontinence, blood in your urine or infection; 
Ovation Alto™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
  
Protocol #771- 0013 Rev. B CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 of 64  • impotence;  
• blood clots or infection in the graft; graft dilatation (stretching);  
• development of a hole between the aorta and the intestines or the aorta and the 
vena cava (major blood vessel carrying blood to the heart);  
• separation of the walls of the aorta;  
• a false aneurysm developi[INVESTIGATOR_864166]; 
• re-operation (additional surgery); and  
• death.   
Your doctor will make every effort to minimize the risks and discomforts of the procedures.  Most of the complications and discomforts listed above can be treated with medications or surgery that can be given to you if your doctor feels it is needed.  In the event of a serious complication or injury, it may be necessary to surgically remove the study device. In that case, the study S ponsor requests that the removed study device be returned to them for 
examination.  
 
RADIATION 
The risks specific to participating in this study may also include complications associated 
with radiation exposure from the x -rays.  However, care will be taken to minimize your 
exposure to the x -rays and the special dye. The follow -up testing has been chosen to 
decrease the amount of unnecessary exposure to x -rays but at the same time ensure that 
complete information about how you are progressing is collected. One of the risks associated with radiation exposure is cancer. The natural incidence of fatal cancer is about 1 chance in 5. Everyday radiation exposure from natural occurring  background radiation 
(sun, radon exposure in the home) is approximately [ADDRESS_1205039] a higher incidence of bleeding complications, such as ulcers, or strokes, both of which can be fatal. Blood thinning medications also increase the  risk of bleeding at the site (groin area) where instruments are 
inserted into the arteries. After your AAA procedure, your doctor may change your medicines. Your doctor will discuss with you all the necessary medications with you before 
you are released from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If you experience any problems or symptoms, call your doctor immediately.  
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
You should know that the success rates of treating patients with AAAs with a system such 
as the Ovation Alto Abdominal Stent Graft System are compelling and this type of 
treatment is fast becoming the method of choice for repairing aneurysms since it is minimally invasive. Furthermore, it does not always require general anesthesia or admission into the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively.

[ADDRESS_911074] of increasing doses of c ystine binding t hiol 
drugs, including t iopronin and D -penicillamine, on urinary cystine capacity, which is a measure 
of the amount of cystine in the urine, in patients with cystinuria.  
 
Cystinuria is a rare genetic disease that can lead to significant morbidity in affected patients due 
to the recurrent nature of the disease. As a result, a significant part of treatment is focused on prevention of stone formation. Current methods of preven tion include increasing fluid intake, 
dietary modifications, alkali therapy, and cystine binding thiol drugs  (CBTDs), which help 
increase the solubility of cystine  in the urine (1). At present, the dosing of CBTDs is empi[INVESTIGATOR_29121], and 
the drugs are not titrated to a specific measured effect. We propose to measure the effect of increasing doses on urinary cystine capacity, in order to help guide treatment. Ultimately, we hope to minimize the amount of unnecessary larger dosages of the medications, which may decrease potential side effects as well as increase compliance with the medications by [CONTACT_674205][INVESTIGATOR_674197].  
 THIOLA® is FDA approved for the prevention of cystine (kidney) stone formation in patients with severe homozygous cystinuria with urinary cystine greater than 500 mg/day, who are resistant to treatment with conservative measures of high fluid intake, alkal i and diet 
modification, or who have adverse reactions to d- penicillamine. CUPRIMINE is FDA approved 
in the treatment of cystinuria.  Both drugs are used within the approved indications. The usual 
dosage of CUPRIMINE in the treatment of cystinuria is 2 g/da y for adults, with a range of 1 to 4 
g/day. The average dose of Thiola in some studies was 1000 mg (1g) but the package insert does not specify a dose range; many clinicians use doses between 500 mg and 3g per day based on 
clinical stone activity and 24h urine collection results.  
2. Specific Aims (Hypothesis and Objectives)  
 
Our primary objective will be to measure the effect of increasing doses of CBTDs on urinary 
cystine capacity. We predict that higher dosages of these medications will lead to a more po sitive 
urinary cystine capacity, or the ability of the urine to take up more cystine (and therefore  
decrease risk of stone formation). However, the dose at which increasing dosages of the medications cease to provide additional benefit is unknown. We propose to directly measure the cystine capacity of urine in response to increasing doses of medications to determine if there is a dose at which the maximum benefit of the drugs exists.  
 This protocol was previously conducted at Lenox Hill Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [LOCATION_001],  and approved by [CONTACT_674206]. The Feinstein Institute conducts research oversite for North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System.   We plan to transfer 2 previously enrolled Lenox Hill participants to NYU. No further enrollment into this p rotocol will occur.

 3. Background  
 
Cystinuria accounts for approximately 1% of kidney stones in adults and 6% to 8% in children 
(2). It is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to an impairment in the renal and intestinal transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids. As a result of the poor solubility of cystine, the 
increased urinary excretion leads to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_674198], resulting in 
nephrolithiasis. The recurrent nature of the stones in this disorder can lead to significa nt 
morbidity in these patients.  
Measurements of cystine excretion in the urine are inaccurate for several reasons. For one, the 
assays cannot reliably distinguish between the thiol groups of cystine and the drugs used to bind cystine ( 3). Prior studies als o found that measurements of cystine solubility varied with pH, and 
therefore nomograms to determine cys tine supersaturation could not accurately be made ( 4). A 
recent assay for cystine capacity is a promising new tool that directly measures the ability of  the 
urine to take up additional cystine from a preformed solid phase (undersaturation, or positive cystine capacity) or give it up to the solid phase (supersaturation, or negative cystine capacity) (3). In contrast to previous assays, the cystine capacity  assay accurately measures cystine 
solubility in the presence of CBTDs ( 5).  The test is widely used by [CONTACT_674207]. Goldfarb.  
Current treatment strategies to prevent stone formation in patients with cystinuria include 
increasing fluid intake, alkalini zing urine with alkali therapy, and cystine -binding thiol drugs 
(CBTD) such as tiopronin (Thiola), D -penicillamine , and captopril. These medications have 
sulfhydryl groups that can reduce the disulfide bond in the cystine and produce mixed disulfides 
with cysteine that are more soluble than the homodimer itself. A study by [CONTACT_674208], et al, showed that CBTDs significantly  increased the cystine capacity of urine compared to the control period 
without CBTDs ( 1). However, this preliminary study did not include a dose -response algorithm 
so the minimum effective dosage of each drug is still unknown. We propose a study of CBTDs in 
patients with cystinuria to measure the change in cystine capacity in the urine in response to 
different dosages of the drugs currently used to treat the disorder, with a goal to help guide 
therapy and ultimately minimize unnecessary side effects caused  by [CONTACT_674209].
 
4. Study Design and Methods  
Due to the low  prevalence of c ystinuria  in the population, the number of patients available to 
participate in this study precludes the ability to conduct a randomized controlled trial with 
satisfactory probability to achieve a projected sample size. We plan to enroll 10- 15 patients in 
the study  and perform a crossover trial in which patients receive escalating dosages of c ystine 
binding t hiol drugs (CBTDs).  
All participants were recruited at Lenox Hill Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674199]. Two remaining participants will be transferred to NYU to complete this protocol.   Patients will be recruited from the clinical practice of the principle investigator at routine clinic visits at Lenox Hill Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  After completing informed consent, the patient will have an initial 
7 
 visit that will be a scree ning interview. During this interview, the patient will be screened for 
symptoms of renal colic, (which if present would exclude him/her from eligibility ), as well as 
asked about any scheduled urologic procedures. A medication history will be taken at this  time , 
and the subject’s most recent bloodwork (including a complete blood count) and most recent 
urinalysis will be reviewed . The total time for this visit should be approximately [ADDRESS_911075] part, patients will stop taking CBTDs for seven 
days and perform a 24 -hour urine collection on day 7. In part 2, patients will take their usual 
CBTD, either tiopronin or d- penicillamine, 1g per day for 7 days, ta ken as 500 mg twice a day. 
They will perform another 24- hour urine collection on day 7 of this study period. In part 3 of the 
study, patients will take a total of 2g of tiopronin or D -penicillamine daily for 7 days  and in part 
4 they will take a total of 3 g/d of tiopronin or D -penicillamine, also for a [ADDRESS_911076] is enrolled in the study, the order in which he/she will perform the study periods will be determined by a computer program that generates a random order of the numbers 1-4. There will not be a specified wash -out period in between study periods due to the short half -
life of the CBTDs. With the exception of CBTDs, the patients will continue all of their regular medications including alkali therapy.  
 Patients will on their self -selected  ad-lib diets.  They will keep a food dia ry during the day before 
the urine collection and during the urine collection. They will then replicate the diet during each 
of the subsequent parts of the study, repeating the same diet on the day before and the day of the 
urine collection. We will collec t the food diaries at the end of the study to ensure compliance and 
to keep a record of what the subjects were eating.  
The urine will be collected with thymol and gentamicin as preservatives, and maintained at room temperature. The urine will be alkalinize d at home with 10g of NaHCO
3 as per the usual 
Litholink protocol for cystine measurement. Study participants will be asked to measure the 
volume of their urine and then mail an aliquot of their urine to a commercial laboratory, Litholink Corp (Chicago, IL) , for analysis.  
The urine pH, sodium, urea, and creatinine will be measured. Additionally, the cystine supersaturation, 24h urine cystine excretion and cystine capacity of each urine sample will be measured by [CONTACT_117843], the “solid phase” cystine assay (3): Measured amounts of 
cystine crystals will be incubated in the urine at 37 ᴼC for 48 hours with stirring. The residual 
solid phase will then be harvested by [CONTACT_128934] 3800 rpm for 20 minutes at room 
temperature and then dissolved in 25ml  of high- pH buffer (0.1 M sodium carbonate; pH 9.9). 
The cystine concentration will be measured in both the supernatant liquid and the buffer to 
determine the change in solid phase, which is known as the cystine capacity.  
The mean cystine capacities in each part of the study (0 g/d of D -penicillamine, 1g/d, 2 g/d, and 
3 g/d) performed will be compared to determine the effect of drug dosage on urinary cystine 
capacity. Urine urea will be measured as a surrogate of protein intake to ensure d iets are 
[ADDRESS_911077] (for complete blood count , one 3 ml  EDTA tube  of 
blood) and urine  test (urinalysis) within one  month of completing the study to monitor for any 
potential adverse effects of changing the dosages of medication. The laboratory tests may either 
be performed at an outside lab at the patient’s convenience, or in a routine off ice visit at Kidney 
Stone Prevention Clinic at NYU. If laboratory tests are performed at an outside laboratory, 
subjects will be asked to send the results to [CONTACT_297553] for review.  
Subjects will be reimbursed for any additional medication costs that they  incur as a result of 
participating in the study, but otherwise will not receive compensation for participation in the study.

5. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The study protocol will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH) 
before submission to individual center IRBs for approval.  Participant enrollment may only begin with IRB approved consent forms.   This is an interventional pi[INVESTIGATOR_674200].  
 
5.1 Study Oversight  
The Study Chair has primary oversight responsibility of this clinical trial. The NIH appointed Data (Observational) Safety Monitoring Board (D/OSMB) has oversight responsibility of t he 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for this clinical trial. The D/OSMB will review accrual, patterns and frequencies of all adverse events, and protocol compliance every 6 months . The 
D/OSMB makes recommendations to the NIH regarding the continuation st atus of the protocol.  
 Each site’s Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_242990] (co -Investigators, research nurses, 
clinical trial coordinators, and data managers) are responsible for identifying adverse events.  
Either the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_83012] -Investigators will call each subject weekly 
during the study period to remind them to change the dose of medication, and to assess for any potential adverse events. All subjects will undergo a blood test for complete blood count and 
urine test for urinalysis within one  month of completing the study to monitor for any adverse 
effects from the changes in medication dosages. The results of the blood and urine tests will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079]. All adverse events will be reported to the D/OSMB. 
Aggregate report - detailed by [CONTACT_926], attribution (expected or unexpected), and relationship to 
the study drug/study procedures – will be available from the DMC C for site review.  A separate 
report detailing protocol compliance will also be available from the DMCC for site review on a monthly basis. The research team will then evaluate whether the protocol or informed consent document requires revision based on t he reports.

 5.2 Definitions and Standards  
The Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network defines an adverse event  as:  “…an unfavorable 
and unintended sign, symptom or disease associated with a participant’s participation in a Rare 
Diseases Clinical Research  Network study.”  
 
Serious adverse events  include those events that:  “result in death; are life -threatening; require 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; create persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defects.”  
 
An unexpected adverse event  is defined as any adverse experience…the specificity or severity of 
which is not consistent with the risks of information described in the protocol.  
 
Expected adverse events  are those that are iden tified in the research protocol as having been 
previously associated with or having the potential to arise as a consequence of participation in 
the study  
 All reported adverse events will be classified using the current version of the Common Terminology Cr iteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) developed and maintained by [CONTACT_674210].  
 
5.3 Expected/Known Risks/Discomforts/Adverse Events Associated with Study 
Intervention and Procedures: Definition of Expected Adverse Events  
 
It is not anticipated that randomization to taking  “no CBTD”  or doses greater or less than  what 
was taken  outside of the study will expose subjects to any risks greater than what is already  
encounter ed from routine use of CBTDs.   
The period off CBTDs is only a week. Duri ng that period, the patients will continue their alkali 
therapy, if prescribed, and their usual fluid intake and dietary restrictions. Therefore , the week 
off CBTD is extremely unlikely to lead to cystine stone formation. That is particularly true since 
dosing of CBTDs is completely empi[INVESTIGATOR_674201]; in 
other words, the doses have not been titrated to a particular level to achieve a particular therapeutic effect.  
CBTDs are associated with allergy and other side effects, most of which are considered 
idiosyncratic and not clearly dose -related. Patients will take [ADDRESS_911079] weekly to be as ked about any potential adverse effects. Within 
11 
 four weeks after finishing this protocol, patients  will undergo blood testing (CBC, 
comprehensive metabolic and urine protein) to monitor for adverse events.  
5.4 Reporting Timeline 
 
• Within 24 hours  (of learni ng of the event), investigators must report any reportable Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE) that:  
o Is considered life -threatening/disabling or results in death of subject  
-OR- 
o Is Unexpected/Unanticipated  
• Investigators must report all other reportable SAEs withi n 5 working days  (of learning of the 
event).  
• All other (suspected) reportable AEs must be reported to the RDCRN within 20 working days  
of the notification of the event or of the site becoming aware of the event.  
 
Local institutional reporting requirements to IRBs, any GCRC oversight committee and the FDA, if appropriate, remain the responsibility of the treating physician and the Study Chair.
 
  
5.5 RDCRN Adverse Event Data Management System (AEDAMS) 
Upon entry of a serious adverse event, the DMCC created Adverse Event Data Management System (AEDAMS) will immediately notify the Study Chair, site PIs, the  Medical Review Officer, and any additional agencies (if applicable - industry sponsor, CTEP, etc) of any reported 
adverse events via email.   
Serious adverse  events : The NIH appointed Medical Review Officer (MRO) determines 
causality (definitely not related, probably not related, possibly related, probably related, definitely related ) of the adverse event. The MRO  may request further information if necessary 
and possibly request changes to the protocol or consent form as a consequence of the adverse event. A back- up notification system is in place so that any delays in review by [CONTACT_66124] 
a specified period of  time are forwarded to a secondary reviewer. The Adverse Event Data 
Management System (AEDAMS) maintains audit trails and stores data (and data updated) and communication related to any adverse event in the study.  
 
Non-serious expected adverse events : Exc ept those listed above as immediately reportable, non-
serious expected adverse events  that are reported to or observed by [CONTACT_1720] a member of his/her research team will be submitted to the DMCC in a timely fashion (within 20 working days). The  events will be presented in tabular form and given to the MRO and RDCRN DSMB 
on a bi -annual  basis. Local site investigators are also required to fulfill all reporting requirements 
of their local institutions.  
 The DMCC will post aggregate reports of all reported adverse events for site investigators and IRBs.  
 
 
12 
 5.6 Study Discontinuation  
The NIH, RDCRN DSMB and local IRBs (at their local site) have the authority to stop or 
suspend this trial at any time . This st udy may be suspended or closed if:  
• Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4989]. The early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_674202]. These toxic effects include allergic manifestations, including rash, and including nausea, vomiting, or other symptoms that lead a patient to not tolerate the medication.   
• Accrual has been met  
• The study objectives have been met  
• The Study Chair / Study Investigators believe it is not safe for the study to continue  
• The RDCRN DSM B suspends or closes the trial  
• The NIH suspends or closes the trial  
 
5.[ADDRESS_911080] a final study visit with the participant and 
participants will be followed clinically until, if applicable, all adverse events resolve.  
 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_2299] 
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_093]  
• Intercurrent illness or event that precludes further visits to the study site or ability to 
evaluate disease (e.g. -mental status change, large pleural effusion).   
 
5.8 Data Quality and Monitoring Measures  
As much as possible data quality is assessed at the data entry point using intelligent on -line data 
entry via visual basic designed screen forms. Data element constraints, whether independent range and/or format limitations or ‘relative’ referential integr ity limitations, can be enforced by 
[CONTACT_5057]. QA reports assess data quality post -data entry. As we note, 
data quality begins with the design of the data collection forms and procedures and incorporates reasonable checks to minim ize transcription and omission errors.  Of the more important quality 
assurance measures are the internal validity checks for reasonableness and consistency. 
 
 
6. Statistical Considerations  
 
The impact of CBTD dose on CysCap will be analyzed with a mixed effects model, with subject as a repeated factor, and including dose and period effects.  
7. Data Management  
 
[ADDRESS_911081] to the participant’s eligibility as per protoco l criteria and obtain 
appropriate informed consent. IRB approval for the protocol must be on file at the DMCC before 
accrual can occur from the clinical site.  
 
The DMCC will use a system of coded identifiers to protect participant confidentiality and 
safet y.  Each participant enrolled will be assigned a local identifier by [CONTACT_66131].   This 
number can be a combination of the site identifier (location code) and a serial accession 
number.  Only the registering site will have access to the linkage between this number and the 
personal identifier of the subject.  When the participant is registered to participate in the study, 
using the DMCC provided web- based registration system, the system will assign a participant ID 
number.  Thus each participant will  have two codes: the local one that can be used by [CONTACT_5047] a second code assigned by [CONTACT_66100].  For all 
data transfers to the DMCC both numbers will be required to uniquely identify the subject.  In 
this fash ion, it is possible to protect against data keying errors, digit transposition or other 
mistakes when identifying a participant for data entry since the numbers should match to 
properly identify the participant.  In this fashion, no personal identifiers wo uld be accessible to 
the DMCC.   
8. Human Subjects  
8.1. GCP Statement  
 This clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that are consistent with Good Clinical Practice  and all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
8.2. Benefits  
 The potential benefits of this study are:  
 There are no direct benefits to participating in this study. However, if there is a maximal beneficial dose of Cystine Binding Thiol Drugs, then physicians will be able to minimize potential side effects of the drugs by [CONTACT_674211], and patients will not be burdened with taking extra unnecessary pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. The results of the study may help guide treatment of patients with cystinuria with CBTDs in the future.  
14 
  
8.3. Risks  
 
The potential risks of this study are:  
 Performing multiple 24 -hour urine collections over the course of four weeks may be 
burdensome, but it is non- invasive and should not cause any pain or discomfort. 
 
It is not anticipated that randomization to taking “no CBTD” or doses greater or less than what 
was taken outside of the study will expose subjects to any risks greater than what is already 
encountered from routine use of CBTDs.  Although i t is possible that some doses in the study  
may exceed the usual dose of medication in subjects , the dose s used in this study are  within the

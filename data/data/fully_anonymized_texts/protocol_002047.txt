Peanut  allergy  is a common condition  and is increasing  in prevalence,  with 1-2% prevalence in 
the pediatric population.(1)  There has been a  doubling  of the number  of peanut allergic children  
during  a recent  10 year period.(2) The natural  history  of peanut  allergy  is persistence with  
resolution  in only  about  20% of children.(3)   It is the most common  cause  of anaphylaxis  in 
children  presenting  to the  emergency  room  department.(4)  
 
Currently,  the only treatment for peanut  allergy  is strict  avoidance  and, if unintentional  ingestion  
occurs,  treatment  with medications  to prevent  food anaphylaxis  is warranted.(3) Unfortunately,  
when  accidental  ingestion occurs,  anaphylaxis and death  can occur.(5,6)  Allergen avoidance  
affects  the quality  of life of the child  and family,  causes  food related anxiety,  and social  
limitation.   Although  other allergic conditions  like allergic rhinitis  and asthma  can be treated  
with subcutaneous  allergen  immunotherapy,  this traditional  therapy  is not feasible in peanut  
allergy  because of the significant  risk of systemic  side effects,  like death  from anaphylaxis.(7,8)  
 
Since subcutaneous  immunotherapy  to food is not feasible,  oral immunotherapy  trials have been  
performed  with demonstrated  safety  and efficacy  of this approach.  Peanut allergy  results  from  
the breakdown  of the immune  system  to maintain  tolerance to peanut allergen.  The gradual  
exposure  to food proteins  orally  is thought  to avoid acute allergic reactions  by [CONTACT_130541]  T cells.(9 - 
16) Desensitization,  or a decreased  clinical  responsiveness  to a defined  amount of  food allergen  
while consuming  daily  doses of  the food,  occurs  through  oral immunotherapy.  Oral 
immunotherapy  does not produce clinical  tolerance  of the food,  defined  as the ability  to 
unrestricted  amounts  of the food antigen  following  a period of  removal  from daily  dosing,  but 
subjects  are desensitized , defined  as the ability  to tolerate an  increased  amount of  food without  
clinical  symptoms  after immunotherapy.  
 
The process  of desensitization  through  immunotherapy  occurs  after an  initial food challenge to 
determine what  amount  of food allergen  causes  a clinical  reaction  in the  subject.  There are two 
phases  in treatment  with oral immunotherapy.  In the first phase,  the build -up phase,  the subject  
ingests  gradually  escalating  doses  of peanut  flour,  administered  orally  in a vehicle  once  every  
day with weekly  or bi-weekly  dose escalation.   Once  a maintenance dose has been  achieved,  the 
subject  continues  to take this amount  in a peanut  equivalent  dose over a period of  years.  Peanut  
equivalent  dosing  has been used in several  prior peanut OIT trials  without  report  of increased  
side effects  or adverse  events. (17-20) The peanut  flour manufacturer  for the initial  trials  in 
peanut  oral immunotherapy  by [CONTACT_130542]  (CoFAR)  
only provided  dosing  for the buildup  phase for the trials  and peanut  equivalent  dosing  was used 
by [CONTACT_130543]. (Personal  communication) Therefore,  given  the experience  
with peanut  equivalent  dosing,  after the first year of this study,  patients  will be switched  to a 
daily  peanut equivalent  dose and intake will  be monitored by [CONTACT_130544].  Since the daily  dose 
will still be  3900 mg  of peanut  protein  for the maintenance phase, the  immunologic effects  of the 
peanut  dosing are not likely  to be  affected.  (11, 12) 
An open  label  study  with an initial  dose of 100 µg increased  to 300 mg  maintenance dose for 
several  months demonstrated  efficacy  in over 90% of the subjects  with desensitization and 
tolerance of a 3900 mg dose on food challenge.(11,12) A follow up double  blind study  
IND [ZIP_CODE]  
H#:[ZIP_CODE]  Version:   13 (25Nov2019 ) 
                          Page 5 of 60  
fdvfsfsdsddfsdsf   
demonstrated  efficacy  with treated  subjects  tolerating  5000  mg compared  to 280 mg  in placebo  
subjects.  The safety  analysis  of these studies  demonstrated  that 93% of children  experienced  
symptoms  on initial  dosing  day with 15% requiring  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].(9) Most reactions  were mild.  
However,  when  the initial dose  was decreased  from 50 mg  down  to 6 mg, allergic side effects  
were noted  in only 47%.   Of 10,184 home  maintenance dosings  of peanut flour, only  3.5%  
caused  symptoms, with 2 subjects  receiving  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238],  each after one maintenance dose 
(0.02%).  The relative safety  of this approach  has been demonstrated  in these  initial  trials.(9)  
 
Given  the risk of clinical  reactions  to peanut allergen  with accidental  unintentional  exposures  
and the impact  of peanut  avoidance on the  quality  of life of peanut allergic  subjects  (21),  peanut  
immunotherapy  as an effective treatment  is an unmet  need.  This effective  therapeutic procedure  
with an acceptable safety  profile is needed  in more  academic centers  around the  country.  
Subjects  receiving  this therapy  need close monitoring  through  expert  centers to treat potential  
systemic symptoms.  The immune  determinants  of clinical  tolerance are still not completely  
understood.  The goal of this proposed  trial is to utilize the efficacy  of oral immunotherapy  to 
study  the safety  of peanut oral immunotherapy  and evaluate immune  mechanisms  of clinical  
tolerance,  using  technology  to identify  T cell cytokine responses  and subsets by [CONTACT_4133].  
This trial will also expand  the availability  of this therapy  to subjects  in the  southern  United  
States.  
 
All subjects  will receive the peanut  protein  intervention. There is no placebo  control  for this 
study.  In order  to meet  inclusion criteria subjects will not be  able to tolerate a 1 gram  peanut  
protein  challenge.  The primary  outcome  to be  studied is the  safety  of the therapy  and the 
secondary  outcome  will include changes  in T and NKT cell  function and intracellular  cytokine  
expression  from  peanut  allergic subjects during  peanut OIT.  We will look at both the  initial  
response to building  up the  dose and changes  during  the maintenance  phase. We  are requesting  a 
target  enrollment  of 15 subjects. Subjects  will be recruited  from  the [LOCATION_007]  Children's  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130471].  Subjects  are expected  to participate  for a total of  38 months.  
After screening  visits, the  study  will require approximately  33 visits with 2 phases:  the build -up 
phase (weeks  0-50), followed  by [CONTACT_130545] (2 years).  
 
 
2. OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary  Objectives:  
 
2.1.1.  The primary  objective  is to determine whether peanut oral immunotherapy  safely  
develops  clinical  tolerance  in peanut  allergic patients by [CONTACT_130546]  6 g of peanut 
flour  with absence of clinical  symptoms during  a food challenge  following  the initial  
desensitization  phase of peanut flour which includes  a 50 week  dose escalation phase 
and 104 week  maintenance  phase on a peanut  equivalent  dose.

2.1.  Secondary  Objectives:  
 
To determine the immune  mechanisms  of clinical  tolerance,  using  technology  to identify  
T cell cytokine responses  and subsets,  as well as basophil  activation  responses  as 
measured  by [CONTACT_4133].  T and NKT  cell function and intracellular  cytokine  
expression  will be measured.  
 
2.2.1.  To determine whether viral exposure  potentiates  response  to in vitro peanut  
allergen  exposure  and to assess  those  changes  during  peanut OIT.  
 
2.2.2.  To compare the change in dose tolerated after one month of abstaining from 
peanut to determine sustained unresponsiveness .

6. TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN  
 
The study  will require approximately  36 visits over  approximately 40 months. Subjects  will 
come to [LOCATION_007]  Children's  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130476], TX for all  desensitization procedures.  Subjects 
will discontinue  antihistamines  (for example,  Benadryl  or Claritin)  for [ADDRESS_147472]  will need to come to [LOCATION_007]  Children's  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130476],  TX to be  
observed.  Subjects  may take antihistamines  during  the study  but must stop them  one week  prior  
to the  first visit for the entry  food challenge.  Once  [ADDRESS_147473] be  off oral  corticosteroids  (for example,  Prednisone) within  one month of  the 
procedure but they  may be taken  during  the remainder of the study  if needed. For the subjects  
safety  prior to any food challenge an  IV catheter needle  will be inserted  into a  vein in the  
subject’s  arm in case  medications  are needed  for treatment  of a reaction.  EMLA®  cream  or L-M- 
X®, a medicine put on the  skin to numb it, may  be applied  to the  skin prior to IV placement  to 
make it less painful.  
The subject  will have blood drawn  throughout  the study.  Approxim ately  1-[ADDRESS_147474] years.  The total  amount  of 
blood for the entire study  will be from  60-90 tablespoons.  
 
 
6.1. Screening  Procedures:  
 
This visit should take approximately  3 hours.  
The following  information will be collected:  
 Consent  and assent;  
 Physical  exam and medical  and diet history;  
 Vital  signs  (pulse,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], blood pressure,  weight,  height,  temperature);  
 Blood  tests (1 teaspoon  to measure peanut -specific  IgE);  
 Allergy  skin prick tests (A small  amount  of allergen  dissolved  in solution is placed  on the  
skin, and the skin is scratched  allowing  the solution to enter the skin.  The presence  of a 
wheal  indicates  sensitivity  to the  allergen.  The subject  will experience itching  at the site 
of the procedure if they are sensitized  to peanut.  The starting  concentration  will be the 
standard  peanut extract  1:20 wt/vol  with serial  dilutions  of 1:200, 1:2000,  1:20,000, and 
1:200,000 wt/vol  as well as oat, wheat,  positive  (histamine) and  negative  (saline)  
controls.)  
 Demographic information  (age,  sex, ethnic origin).  
 Serum  pregnancy  test for menstruating  females  (1/10 tsp of  blood)

 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]:   Spi[INVESTIGATOR_130477].   If valid spi[INVESTIGATOR_130478], the  attempt  is documented  and peak flow measures  will be 
accepted  for the entry  criteria with  results  >90% of predicted.   For participants  that are 
able to complete spi[INVESTIGATOR_038],  FEV1  must be  greater than 90% predicted.  
 Peak  flow will  be determined  for the patient.  
 Screening  visit will occur  within  1 month of  the DBPCFC.  
 
 
6.2. Study  Medication/Intervention:  
 
The product  to be  used in this study  is only peanut flour.  Subjects  that cannot tolerate the initial  
low doses  of peanut  flour  will not be  enrolled.  The peanut  flour will  be given  in small  pre- 
measured  soufflé  cups containing  the amount  of peanut flour that  needs to be  eaten  for one dose.  
The flour will  be received from  the University  of North  Carolina at  Chapel  Hill Manufacturing  
Facility  (See Letter of Authorization).  Lot-to-lot testing  will be performed  by [CONTACT_130550].  The process  involves  
running an SDS-PAGE gel  with the previous  lot and the  new lot. Densitometric scanning  is then 
performed  to compare Ara h 1 levels  and Ara h 2 levels. The University  of North  Carolina at  
Chapel  Hill Manufacturing  Facility  has defined  the acceptable  ranges  to be  less than 30% for Ara 
h 1 and 20% for Ara h 2. If a lot fails the test, the batch is discarded  and a new lot of  peanut  flour  
is ordered.  The peanut  protein will be received  by [CONTACT_130551]  (CAGT).  
The CAGT is a Good  Manufacturing  Practice (GMP)  compliant  facility  (See Letter of 
Authorization) and  is accredited  by [CONTACT_130552]  
(FACT),  the College of American  Pathologists  (CAP)  and is CLIA  registere d. The protein  doses  
will be monitored  and dispensed  by [CONTACT_130553].  
The drug would  be stored in the  cold room  (2-8°C)  within  the clean  room  area restricted  to 
CAGT GMP  Facility  Staff.  It is on continuous  temperature monitoring  via our Isensix  system.  In 
the case of an alarm  staff is informed  via pager system.  Alarms  and monitoring  data are also full 
backed  up by [CONTACT_130554].  This drug will be stored  in a dedicated  facility  away  from  
other allergens  and will be handled  in a separate  room on a  separate air handling  systems.  
The pre -measured  soufflé  cups will be transported by a clinical  research  staff member  within  
[LOCATION_007]  Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130479].  
The peanut  flour  will be used within  the manufacturer’s  expi[INVESTIGATOR_130480].  
One dose of peanut flour  is taken  per day.  Prior to taking  the dose the subject must eat a snack  
high in carbohydrate and  fat such as a bagel  or chips and then eat the peanut flour mixe d into  
liquid or  another food  such as apple sauce  or ice cream.  
The vehicle  food for each subject  will be a food,  to which  the subject  is not allergic.  The subject  
will need  to eat the peanut flour at  approximately  the same time every  day.  After eating  the

The dosing guidelines  for peanut  flour  will continue to be  followed.  
 
Table  1. Schedule during  build -up phase for missed daily  doses  
(time intervals  from  missed  doses)  
• Up to 2 days,  continue  doses  as scheduled.  
• 3-4 consecutive days after missed  dose;  repeat  previous doses  but dose  will be  given  in 
the Allergy/Immunology  Clinic.  
• More than  4 days after missed  dose,  patient  will return  to Allergy/Immunology  Clinic  
for a graded  challenge.  
 
6.3. Entry  Oral Food Challenge (approximately  9 hours):  
 
 Amount  of blood to be  drawn  at this visit:  Blood  drawn  to check  the peanut -specific  IgE, 
IgG and IgG4  levels,  and cellular immune  studies  and basophil  activation  studies  will be 
drawn  and evaluated  at [LOCATION_007] Children’s  Center for Human  Immunobiology  (Baylor  
College of Medicine)  for analysis.  
IgG and IgG4  are antibodies that may have  a role in tolerating  peanut.  They  will be 
followed  throughout  the study  and we will evaluate how they are changing  while the 
subject  is on therapy.  In addition  we will  be obtaining  blood for the immune  cell studies.  
 In order  to obtain  sufficient quantity  of cells we will collect  the maximum amount  of 
blood allowable as  defined  by [CONTACT_130555]’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130481]’s  weight.  
This will range  from  4 to 6 tablespoons  total of blood drawn  for the visit.  
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]:  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_130482].  For participants  
that complete peak  flow the results  must be  > 90% of predicted.   For participants that 
complete spi[INVESTIGATOR_038],  FEV1 must be  greater than  90% predicted  on the  day of the 
challenge to participate in the food  challenge . 
 Targeted  History  and Physical  Exam and Diet History:  A brief medical  and diet history  
will be obtained  and a focused physical  exam will be performed.

 DBPCFC:   Subjects  eligible for the study  (peanut -specific im munoglobulin  E level  
greater than  7kU/L  AND  a positive  skin prick  test to peanut) will  come to [LOCATION_007]  
Children's  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130483] a Double  Blind  Placebo  Controlled  Food  Challenge  
(DBPCFC) to the  study  protein to determine if the subject  is allergic to peanut.  The table  
below labeled  Table  [ADDRESS_147477]  will start treatment  correlating  with the  dose at which  a reaction is  
noticed.

eating  a placebo  at different  times.  A placebo  is a substance that  is similar to the  test substance in 
appearance,  smell,  and taste. The peanut  protein is a  flour and  will be given  mixed with either  
juice (at  lower  doses) or with a food like baby  [CONTACT_8208].  The placebo  is oat flour for peanut  
DBPCFC  and will be given  in the  same manner.  
The food  will be given  in a “double -blinded” fashion under observation  at [LOCATION_007]  Children's  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130476].  During  both of  the feedings,  the food protein  to be  given  during  the 
challenge will  start with the equivalent  of less than 1/100th of  a peanut  and progressively  larger  
doses  will be given  at [ADDRESS_147480] a reaction  to one  of the doses,  the dosing  of study  protein  
will be stopped  and the allergic  reaction  will be treated with  an antihistamine and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_130484],  oral or 
injectable steroids,  or H2 blockers).  Overall,  patients with a history  of a prior  clinical  reaction  to 
peanut  will be observed  for [ADDRESS_147481] not had previous oral exposure  to peanut  may

demonstrate a delayed  immune  response,  given  the lack of prior  peanut  exposure. Therefore,  
those  subjects  will be observed  for a longer  duration of  150 minutes.  (21-24) The highest  dose of 
peanut  protein  will be equivalent  to [ADDRESS_147482]  reacted  to during  the 
DBPCFC  (Table 2).  
 
 
6.4. Buildup  Visit Weeks  0 – 50 or until highes t tolerated dose (maintenance  dose) is 
reached (approximately  3 hours  per visit):  
 
 First build -up visit will occur within  [ADDRESS_147483] home  dose in the  clinic,  the child  may return  for a lower  dose 
visit up to two times.  If he/she  cannot  tolerate the 1.8mg  dose,  the subject  will be 
excluded  from  the trial. 
 Amount  of blood to be  drawn:   Every  6 weeks  at weeks  6, 12, 18, 24, 30,  36, 42, 48, etc. 
we will  draw up to 4-6 tablespoons of  blood (based  on the  subject’s  weight) for immune  
studies,  peanut -specific  IgE, IgG, and IgG4  and basophil histamine release  assays.  Blood  
will not be  drawn  at the other  build -up visits.  
 Peak  Flow:   Peak  flow measures  will be accepted  with results  >90% of predicted.  
 Allergy  Skin Prick  Tests:  At week  24, endpoint  dilution skin testing  to peanut  will be 
repeated.  The procedure  will be performed  as described  under  section  6.1 “Screening  
Procedures.”  
 Targeted  History  and Physical  Exam and Diet History:  A brief medical  and diet history  
will be obtained  and a focused  physical  exam will be performed.  
 Review Home Symptom  Diary:   At each visit we will review any symptoms experienced  
while taking  the food protein.  
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_130485]/guardian  will 
demonstrate proper  use. 
 Dose Escalation:  The subject must return  in no less than 10 days after each visit to  
receive an  increased  amount of peanut  protein.  (See Table 3.)  At each visit the  subject  
will be given  a slightly  larger amount  of peanut protein than he or she was receiving  prior  
to that visit.  After the first visit the  subject  will be taking  at least the  equivalent  of 
approximately  1/100th of  a peanut  daily  and once  the subject  gets to the  maintenance  
dose he or she will be taking  the equivalent  of approximately  [ADDRESS_147484]  dose tolerated.  This is 
known  as the maintenance  dose.

discretion.  
6.10 Scientific Rationale for Immune Cell Response Studies:  
 
Peanut  allergy  has more  than tripled  in prevalence  over the past decade, and there are no reliable  
predictors  of peanut allergic reactions. This provides  the impetus  to conduct  research  to 
characterize the mechanistic  factors  driving  the immune  responses  and evaluate the effect  of T 
and NK T lymphocyte phenotypic  and functional  profiles  in the  development  of tolerance to

                          Page [ADDRESS_147494]  clinical  severi ty.(22)  
 
The specific  aim is to define  the role of peanut specific T cell responses  on the regulation  of 
tolerance in peanut allergic disease.   The relationship  between  the level of  tolerance (i.e.  highest  
clinically  tolerated  peanut protein  dose) and  peanut specific T cell activation  markers,  
transcription  factors  and intracellular inflammatory  cytokine production will be  further  
characterized.   Furthermore,  we will analyze basophil activation  in subjects  undergoing  OIT.

Hypothesis:  Polyfunctional  flow cytometric  analysis  will elucidate differential T  cell and 
invariant  NKT cell activation  responses  involved  in the  expression  of peanut allergy  in subjects  
prior to and after desensitization through  detection  of the followin g.

SIGNIFICANCE:  
 
Th1/Th2/Treg  response  
 
CD4  positive  T cells differentiate into different  T helper and  inducible  Tregulatory  (Treg) cells  
upon stimulation  of antigens.  (27) In particular,  TH2 cells participate in immunity  against  
helminthic infections  as well as being  involved  in allergic diseases  through  the production  of 
cytokines  such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. (27)  TH1 cells activate macrophages  through  the 
production  of cytokines  such as IFN γ, as well as CD8  cells to enhance intracellular killing.  (28)

and TGF -β (13).   iNKT  cells are skewed  towards  production  of IL-4 and IL-13 in food allergic  
chidlren  compared  to non -food allergic  children.  (29,30)  It is thought  that the skewing  of the 
delicate balance between  these subtypes  of T cells toward  TH2 leads to allergic disease.  
 
Currently,  in the  literature,  there have  been several studies  showing  an increase in cytokines  and 
transcription  factors  associated  with a TH2 phenotype  with a suppression  of the TH1 response in 
allergic disease.   It has been well established  that atopic subjects  often  exhibit  defective  
expression  of T-bet, a transcription  factor  essential  for TH1  development,  whereas  non-allergic  
subjects  do not. (31)  Likewise,  it has been  shown  that although  patients  with peanut  allergy  
IND [ZIP_CODE]  
H#:[ZIP_CODE]  Version:   13 (25Nov2019 ) 
                          Page [ADDRESS_147497]  
outgrown  their allergy,  show  TH1 skewing  to peanut antigens.  (32) This was determined  by 
[CONTACT_130558] T cell production  of IFN-y, TNF -a, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 to peanut  
antigen  stimulation.  This method  has been  extended to assess  eosinophilic gastrointestinal  
disease (29),  but has not been  assessed  with a polyfunctional  flow cytometric method  to assess  
multiple  cytokines  within  one cell simultaneously.  (32-34) 
 
In allergy  and asthma models,  there is evidence that Treg cells control  disease  in a manner  that is 
dependent  upon  IL-10 (35) and some  reports  suggest  IL-10 induction  of TGF-β is important.  (36) 
IL-10 is important  in the  regulation  of T cell induced colitis. (37)  IL-10 production by [CONTACT_130559].  
While  there remains  some  controversy  and inconsistency  in the  literature,  it has been reproduced  
multiple  times  in separate studies  that in patients  with atopic disease compared  to those  with 
healthy  controls,  there  are often  decreased  numbers of  FoxP3+  cells,  a marker of T-regulatory  
cells.  (38-42) 
 
Although  there  is strong  evidence  for a balance  of T helper cell subtypes  directing  the immune  
response that  leads  to these  allergic processes,  there  are very few studies  in the literature that  
look at the specific intracellular production  of cytokines  in T helper cells upon antigenic  
stimulation  of T cells.   Most studies  look at serum  cytokine production or  T cell production  in 
supernatants  after stimulation  (43-46), which  may differ from what  is produced  intra-cellularly.  
In addition,  no studies  look at the combination  of TH1,  TH2,  iNKT cell and Treg responses  to 
peanut  antigens  before  and after desensitization.  Also,  while some  studies  look at transcription  
factors  or cytokines,  few have looked  at the combination  of transcription  factor and  cytokine  
production,  and no studies have evaluated  the combination of  memory  cell production,  activation  
markers,  transcription  factors,  and cytokine production after peanut allergen stimulation.  
Decreasing  these deficiencies  in the  literature is integral  to understanding  these disease processes  
and development  of future  therapeutic options.  
 
We propose to close these  gaps by [CONTACT_130560].  We intend  to use  polyfunctional  
flow cytometry  to establish the  T cell response in patients  with peanut  allergy  before  and after 
desensitization.  Polyfunctional  flow cytometry  allows  us to look at multiple markers  at the same  
time,  which  would  allow us the  luxury  of evaluating  the TH1, TH2,  TH17,  iNKT  and Treg 
responses  together.   We can also look at multiple  factors  including  cytokine  production,  memory  
cell creation,  transcription  factors,  as well as activation  factors.   This would give us a broad  
scope of what the  true responses of  T and NKT  cells are in patients  with peanut allergy.  
 
INNOVATION  
 
Cytokine production  of T lymphocytes  has been performed  in peanut allergic  patients  but this is  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_130496].  (43-46) 
Intracellular cytokine staining  of T cells has been  performed  in peanut allergic patients (32, 46- 
47) but the  relationship  of production  of T cell cytokines  and transcription  factors  intracellularly  
in peanut  allergy  has not been  studied.  
IND [ZIP_CODE]  
H#:[ZIP_CODE]  Version:   13 (25Nov2019 ) 
                          Page [ADDRESS_147498] included  
IFN-y, TNF -α, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-17. Makedonas  et al. (16) have established  a model  of 
assessment  of T cell activation  through  a polyfunctional 14 color flow cytometry  in virus  specific  
CD8+ T cells.  (16) Intracellular cell  surface markers, cytokines  and transcription factors  were  
analyzed  with this approach.   This comprehensive  examination  of T lymphocyte function  has 
never been performed  in the context of  food allergic disease.  We propose to evaluate peanut  
specific CD4+ T cell activation  by [CONTACT_130561].  The ability  to determine TH1,  TH2,TH17  iNKT and  T regulatory  responses  on a 
cellular level  will give further insight  into the  mechanisms  controlling  the clinical  expression  of 
food allergy.  
 
 
6.8. Correlative studies:  
 
The peanut -specific immunoglobulin  G and G4 tests and immune  cell experiments  in this study  
are designed  for research, not for medical  purposes.  They  are not useful  for finding  problems or  
diseases.   Even  though  the researchers  are not looking  at the subject’s  peanut -specific  
immunoglobulin  G and G4 tests to find or treat a medical  problem,  he or she will be told if  they 
notice something  unusual.  The subject  and his or  her regular doctor  can decide  together whether  
to follow up with more tests  or treatment.   Because the food-specific immunoglobulin  G and G4 
tests and immune  cell experiments  done  in this study  are not for  medical  purposes, the  research  
results  will not be  sent to the  subject  or to their regular doctor.  
 
 
The basophil  histamine release  assay,  also known  as the basophil  activation  test (BAT) will  be 
performed  on blood samples  collected  from subjects throughout  the study.   The findings  from  
BAT are designed  for research  and will not be  sent to the  subject  or their regular doctor.  
 
6.9. Procedures  for storing of  extra  or left over samples:  
 
Any extra  serum  will be stored  in a freezer in the  Allergy  and Immunology  laboratories  at [LOCATION_007]  
Children's  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130476].  
The sample will  be labeled  with the subject’s  unique  identifier number.  The subject’s  name  [CONTACT_130588]. The link to the  unique  identifier number  
will be stored  in a binder  in [CONTACT_123914]’s  office in a locked  cabinet  in Houston.  
The samples  will be accessible  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Davis  and other  study  personnel.  
If samples  are used for reasons apart  from those  listed  in this study  (measuring  food-specific  IgE, 
IgG and IgG4,  cellular immune  studies) a study  protocol will be submitted  and an approval  must  
be granted  by [CONTACT_130562]  (IRB) of Baylor College of Medicine before the 
serum  can be used.

Potential  adverse reactions seen in subjects  treated with peanut  OIT and  subjects undergoing  
DBPCFC  include the following:  skin manifestations  such as pruritus,  urticaria,  or angioedema;  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_130497],  coughing , nasal congestion/rhinorrhea,  cough  and 
hoarseness;  and gastrointestinal  manifestations  such as vomiting,  diarrhea,  or abdominal  pain.  
Eosinophilic esophagitis,  an allergic  gastrointestinal  disease,  can also occur. Anaphylaxis  is a 
potential  risk involving  any of the above symptoms plus hypotension  and circulatory  collapse.  
The study  will be stopped and reviewed  by [CONTACT_45822] [INVESTIGATOR_130498]: 
• Any death (grade 5) related to peanut  OIT dosing  
• Greater than  [ADDRESS_147499]  tolerated  dose until the  
study  re-opens.  
• Greater than  3 subjects  that require  greater than  1 injection of  intramuscular  epi[INVESTIGATOR_130499]  
• Greater than  [ADDRESS_147500] awal  Criteria:  
 
No subject  initiating  therapy  in this trial will be replaced.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130500]:  
 Greater than  or equal  to four  missed  or ‘no-show’  appointments  and four missed home  
doses,  
 Greater than  4 instances  of not having  or carrying an unexpi[INVESTIGATOR_130501]  
 Anaphylactic reaction listed  as a Grade 4 as defined  by [CONTACT_130563].  
 Any participant  is diagnosed  with eosinophilic esophagitis  
 Any participant  is diagnosed  with moderate to severe asthma based on the  NHLBI  
guidelines  
 Any participant  needs treatment  with greater than  medium  daily  doses  of inhaled  
corticosteroids,  as defined by [CONTACT_130564]  
 Any participant  has an accidental  peanut  ingestion  with anaphylaxis  during  the time on 
oral desensitization  
 
 
Participants  may be prematurely  terminated  from  the study  if:

 The participant  elects  to withdraw consent  from  all future study  activities,  including  
follow -up 
 The participant  is “lost to follow -up” (i.e.,  no further follow -up is possible  because  
attempts  to reestablish  contact  [CONTACT_130565])  
 The participant  dies 
 
 
6.12. Follow -up of Discontinued  Participants  
 
Participants  who prematurely  discontinue  treatment  with study  drug will remain  in the  study  
until normal  termination.  Subjects  may receive  the option of  receiving  a peanut equivalent  if 
indicated.  All willing  subjects will be followed  for the duration  of the study, and continue blood  
draws  for mechanistic studies while on a peanut  restricted  diet, and be monitored  for accidental  
ingestions  and safety  parameters.

7. POTENTIAL RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS:  
 
Peanut  oral immunotherapy  may cause some,  all or none  of the side-effects  listed  below.  
 
The buildup and daily  maintenance  doses  of OIT may cause  allergic symptoms.  The likelihood  
of a subject  experiencing  any allergic symptoms will be lessened  by [CONTACT_130566].  
 
Symptoms  often  seen with therapy  and during  the food challenges:  
 
 
Likely  (more  than 20% of subjects)  
 Rare bursts  of sneezing  or nasal  itching  
 Occasional  sniffling  
 Mild congestion  
 Occasional  scratching  
 Mild nausea or abdominal pain (e.g. no change  in activity  level)  (~43% of 
subjects  on initial  escalation  day) 
 Moderate nausea  or abdominal pain (e.g. noticeable decrease in activity  level)  
(~29% of subjects on initial  escalation  day) 
 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_130506]  
 Throat  clearing  
 Occasional  cough  
 Mild urticaria (less  than 3 hives)  
 Mild rash (few areas  of faint redness)  
Unlikely  (2 – 20% of subjects)  
 Frequent  sniffling  
 Hoarseness  or a frequent dry  cough  
 2 to 3 epi[INVESTIGATOR_130507]  
 Itching  of more than  50% of the body  
 Skin redness  covering  more  than 50% of the body  
 Hives  covering  more  than 50%  of the body  
 Continuous scratching  for more than  2 minutes  
 Wheezing  
Serious  but Rare (less  than 2%  of subjects ) 
A potential  risk associated  with both the  desensitization  procedure and  food challenge is the  
risk of a severe allergic reaction,  called  anaphylaxis,  which  may occur  in <2%  of patients.  
Symptoms  of anaphylaxis  may include those  listed  above (itchy  rash, hives, facial  swelling,  
wheezing,  cough,  shortness of  breath,  vomiting,  diarrhea),  and in severe  cases  low blood  
pressure,  loss of  consciousness,  and, rarely,  death.  Medication,  personnel,  and equipment  
are immediately  available  in the event  of an anaphylactic reaction.  
The potential  discomforts  with the desensitization  procedure or food challenge  are no more

appointment  will be rescheduled.  
 
Loss of Confidentiality:  
Any time information  is collected;  there  is a potential risk for loss of  confidentiality.  Every  
effort  will be made  to keep the  subject’s  information  confidential;  however, this cannot  be 
guaranteed.  
 
If parents  or guardian  asks, they  will be told the  results of  a pregnancy  test or that the subject  is 
using  birth  control.  
 
Risks of  Blood  Drawing:  
Risks associated  with drawing  blood include minimal discomfort  and/or bruising.   Infection,  
excess  bleeding,  clotting,  and/or fainting  also are possible,  although  unlikely.  
 
Subjects  will have approximately  1-[ADDRESS_147503] years  for a total of approximately  14 times.  The total  amount  of blood for the 
entire study  will be 60–90 tablespoons.  
 
Risks of  Allergy  Skin Tests:  
The risk  involved  with skin testing  includes  discomfort  from  the needle  prick, along  with 
itching  and swelling  at the skin test site in positive  responses.  Less common  side effects  include  
severe  allergic  reactions.  
 
Financial  Risks:  
Subjects  will not have extra costs  incurred  because  of the study  apart  from  missed  work  
secondary  to study -related  appointments.   Subjects  will not be  responsible for charges  
associated  with allergy  prick skin tests,  blood tests (except  for serum  IgE),  urine pregnancy  
tests,  study  dose increases,  or food challenges.  However,  routine medical  care for the subject’s  
condition  will be charged  to the  subject . than when  eating  the suspected  food in the  past. Symptoms  usually  are short -lived  (less 
than 2 hours).  To minimize  the risk of reaction,  small  amounts  of the food suspected  to 
cause a reaction  will be given  at the start of the desensitization procedure and food 
challenge.

8. DATA MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
 
8.1. Sources  of Research  Material:  
 
8.1.1.  Existing  records:  
Previous  CAP -FEIA serum  IgE reports  will be included in each subject’s  record.  
Existing  subject  medical  records  will not otherwise be used unless  records are needed  
to verify  or clarify  the severity  of the original  reaction to peanut  ingestion.  
 
8.1.2.  Data collected  during  research:  
 Consent  and assent  
 Demographic information  (age,  sex, ethnicity)  
 History  and Physical  examination  (including  diet history,  family  histo ry, past 
medical  and past surgical  history)  
 Allergy  skin prick testing  to peanut  
 Mechanistic blood draws  
 Serum  Beta HCG and  urine  pregnancy  test for all menstruating  females.  
 Observed  dosing  adverse  event  log. 
 Concomitant  medication  administration  while on study.  
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_42555]/or peak  flow 
 Double -Blinded  Placebo  Controlled  Food  Challenge  (DBPCFC) (for those  
with confirmed  CAP -FEIA serum  IgE > [ADDRESS_147504]).

Symptom  diaries  will be recorded  daily  by [CONTACT_4317].  
 
 
8.2. Data  and Safety Monitoring  Plan  
 
This study  will be reviewed regularly  by a Data  and Safety  Review  Committee (DRC).  
The DRC  will monitor  the study  for progress  and enrollment, toxicities, adverse events,  
and soundness  of data.  The committee will  consist  of Drs. Lenora Noroski,  Filiz

8.3. Quality Assurance  
 
Quality  Assurance  (QA)  Review will  be conducted  at least once shortly  after initiation  of 
participant  recruitment,  annually  during  the study  (or more frequently  if indicated),  and at the 
end or closeout  of the trial. The number of participants audited  will be determined  by 
[CONTACT_130567].  
 
The audit  will include a review of source  documentation to evaluate compliance for: 
• Informed  consent documents and procedures  
• Adherence to eligibility  criteria  
• Protocol  defined  treatment  
• Required  baseline,  on study  and follow -up protocol testing  
• IRB and other  regulatory  documents  (submitted  amendments,  annual  continuing  review  
reports,  SAEs)  
• Case Report  Form  submissions: timelines  and accuracy  
 
Each  QA review  will be summarized  and a final report  will be sent to the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_874]  30 days 
of the completion.  The report will include a summary  of findings,  participant by [CONTACT_130568],  specific recommendations  on any  performance  and/or shortcomings  and request  
for corrective  action,  when necessary.  
 
 
9. MEASUREMENT  OF EFFECT  
 
 
9.1. Response Review:  
 
The Data Safety  Monitoring  Committee will  review the responses  to the  primary  and 
secondary  objectives  every  6 months during  the trial. 
 
 
9.2. Response Criteria:  
 
9.2.1.  The primary  objective  will be  measured  by [CONTACT_130569]  
6 g peanut flour challenge  at time 50 weeks  compared  to time  0 weeks.  The change in 
tolerated dose will be assessed between baseline and one year. The proportion  of 
patients  who tolerate 6 g of peanut flour  will be compared  at baseline and at the one   
year point using  McNemar’s  test for matched  pair data.  The proportion of  subjects  will 
be estimated  with exact  binomial  confidence intervals.   
 
9.2.2.  For the first secondary  objective,  flow cytometric  analysis  of T, NKT  cells,  and 
basophils  will be performed  through  the measurement of  the percent  of cells producing  a

(discrete),  and the matrix  of correlated  error terms  will assume a first-order  
autoregressive structure.  Alternative correlation  structures  such as the unstructured  and 
compound  symmetry  will be  considered.  Correlation structures  will be assessed  by 
[CONTACT_100830]’s  Information  Criteria.  The likelihood  ratio test will be used to test for overall  
significance of the model. P-values  will be adjusted using  the Holm’s  step down  
Bonferonni  correction  for multiple  comparisons.  Activation  responses  that are significant  
at the 0.05 level  after adjustment  will be further assessed.  Pairwise comparisons between  
discrete time points will be tested  for significant  differences,  and p-values  will be 
adjusted  using  the Bonferonni  correction.  Statistical  significance of the adjusted p-values  
will be assessed  at the 0.05 level.  
 
Spearman  rank correlations  will be estimated  for all pairwise comparisons  between  
activation  responses.  P-values  for testing  for significant  correlations  will be adjusted  
using  Bonferonni’s  correction  for multiple  compariso ns. Partial  correlation  coefficients  
will also be estimated  for all activation  responses  adjusting  for subject -level  effects  
across  all time points.  
 
9.2.3.  The second  secondary  objective  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_130570][INVESTIGATOR_130510].  This number will  be compared  to the  epi[INVESTIGATOR_130511].  The proportion  of subjects  will be  
estimated  with exact  binomial  confidence intervals. This analysis  will also be used to 
determine the proportion of  symptomatic daily  doses with preceding  symptoms of  viral 
infection  compared  to non-viral associated  symptomatic daily  doses.  
9.2.4.  The third secondary objective will be assessed by [CONTACT_130571] 24 month food challenge to the 25 month food challenge  
using  McNemar’s  test for matched  pair data. 
 
 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 
10.1. Sample size considerations:  
 
Sample size was estimated  to detect  a statistically  significant  difference in the  proportion  of T 
cells producing  interferon -gamma (IFN  gamma),   at the [ADDRESS_147507]. A  difference in proportions of  0.60 units (.2 at baseline and  .8 at 1 
year)  would  be clinically  important.  Assuming  a common SD=0.6  at each time point, correlation  
between  repeated  measures is 0.50 and alpha = 0.05, a  sample size of [ADDRESS_147508]  this difference with  80% power.  Assuming  50% attrition,  this study  will plan 
to enroll  a total of 15 subjects.

11. PROTECTION  OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
Potential  benefits  if the therapy  is tolerated  include: the  potential  decrease in the subject’s  
reactivity  to peanuts  after an accidental  ingestion  of peanut,  altering  the natural  progression  of 
peanut  allergy,  becoming clinically  and immunologically  tolerant  to peanut,  which  is otherwise  
not likely  to happen,  and the ability  to broaden  their diet and lead a more  normal life without  the 
restrictions  caused  by [CONTACT_7661]  a potentially  severe  food allergy.  This study  will also help to 
expand the  knowledge of food allergy  in general  and may  lead to new management  and 
therapeutic protocols for individuals  with other food -allergies.  
 
All data will  be kept on secure internal  databases  on the  [LOCATION_007]  Children's  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130512]. The files  will be password  protected  and deleted at  the earliest  
possible  convenience.  When feasible,  all data will  be stripped  from  identifiers  to reduce the risk 
of patient  identifiable information  from  being  intercepted  by [CONTACT_130572].  Our research  
team  knows  and understands that it is our  responsibility  to protect  patient  records  and personal  
information  and will fully abide  to HIPAA regulations.  
 
The subjects  will not be  financially  responsible for  any research -related  clinic  visits, procedures,  
or peanut  oral immunotherapy.  Standard  of care clinic  visits and laboratory  and diagnostic tests,  
however,  will have to be  covered  by [CONTACT_130573]’s  insurance.  
 
Participation  will be voluntary  and will require informed  consent  by [CONTACT_130574]/her  
legally  authorized  representative,  parent,  or guardian  according  to state  regulations.  The patient

H#:[ZIP_CODE]  Version:   13 (25Nov2019 ) 
                          Page [ADDRESS_147509] to be fully  aware of potential  worsening  of symptoms when  even life- 
threatening  conditions  may emerge necessitating  surgical  and/or intensive  care interventions.  
 
 
 
12. ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
 
12.1. Adverse Event  (AE) or Medical  Event:  
 
An adverse event  is a new, undesirable medical  event or  occurrence or worsening  of an 
existing  condition  (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding) in a subject  that occurs  
during  treatment  and throughout  the study,  whether or not it is considered  to be study  
related.  This includes  the following:  
 AEs not previously  observed in the  patient  that emerge during  the protocol -specified  AE 
reporting  period,  including  signs  or symptoms associated  with peanut  allergy  that were  
not present  prior to the  AE reporting  period  
 Complications  that occur as  a result  of protocol -mandated  interventions  (e.g.,  invasive  
procedures  such as biopsies)  
 If applicable,  AEs that occur  prior to assignment  of study  treatment  associated  with 
medication  washout,  treatment run-in, or other protocol -mandated  intervention  
 Preexisting  medical  conditions (other than  the condition being  studied) judged  by [CONTACT_130575] -specified  AE reporting  period  
Potential  adverse reactions seen in subje cts treated with peanut  OIT and  subjects  
undergoing  DBPCFC  include  the following:  skin manifestations  such as pruritus, urticaria,  
or angioedema;  respi[INVESTIGATOR_130497],  coughing,  nasal  
congestion/rhinorrhea,  cough  and hoarseness; and gastrointestinal  manifestations  such as 
vomiting,  diarrhea,  or abdominal pain.   Anaphylaxis  is a potential  risk involving  any of the 
above symptoms plus hypotension  and circulatory  collapse.  
 
 
12.2. Serious  Adverse Event:  
 
A serious  adverse event is defined as  any adverse  therapy  experience occurring  at any dose 
that results  in the  following:  
 Death:  A death occurring during  the study,  or which  comes  to the  attention  of the 
investigator during  the protocol -defined  follow -up after the completion  of therapy  
whether or not considered  treatment  related,  must be  reported.  
 Life-threatening:  Any adverse therapy  experience  that places  the subject or  subjects,  
in the  view of the investigator,  at immediate risk  of death from  the reaction as it 
IND [ZIP_CODE]  
H#:[ZIP_CODE]  Version:   13 (25Nov2019 ) 
                          Page 35 of 60  
  
occurred  (i.e., it does not include a reaction  that had it occurred  in a more serious  
form,  might  have  caused  death).  
 In-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130513].  
 Persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity.  
 Congenital  anomaly/birth  defect.  
 An event  that required  intervention  to prevent  permanent impairment  or damage.  
All AEs that do not meet  any of the criteria for serious should be  regarded  as non - 
serious  AEs.  
Each  recorded  AE or SAE  will be described  by [CONTACT_13662]  (i.e., start and end 
dates),  severity,  regulatory  seriousness  criteria if applicable,  suspected  relationship  
to the  investigational  product (see below),  and actions taken.  
 
 
12.3. Expected  adverse  event  and unexpected  adverse  event:  
 
Expected  adverse  events  are those  that have  been  previously  identified  as resulting  from  
administration  of the agent.   For purposes  of this study,  an adverse event  is considered  
expected  when  it is included  in the  protocol  and informed  consent document as a 
potential  risk. 
 
An adverse event  is considered  unexpected  when  it varies  in nature,  intensity,  or 
frequency  from  information  provided  in the  current adverse  event  list in the  protocol  and 
informed  consent  document as a potential  risk. 
 
 
12.4. Toxicity Grading  
 
The terms  “severe” and  “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity  refers  to the  intensity  of 
an AE (as  in mild, moderate,  or severe pain); the  event itself may be of relatively  minor  
medical  significance  (such  as severe  headache).  “Serious”  is a regulatory  definition and 
is based  on patient  or event outcome or action  criteria usually  associated  with events  that 
pose a threat  to a patient’s  life or vital functions.  Seriousness  (not severity)  serves  as the 
guide for defining  regulatory  reporti ng obligations.  
 
Toxicity  grades  are assigned to indicate the severity  of adverse  experiences  and 
toxicities  using  The World Allergy  Organization  (WAO)  as displayed  in Table  8. The 
World Allergy  Organization  (WAO) (44) has  been  reviewed  specifically  for this 
protocol  and is otherwise  appropriate  for this study  population.  The purpose  of using  
the WAO  system  is to provide  standard  language  to describe toxicities and to facilitate  
tabulation  and analysis  of the data and  assessment  of the clinical  significance of 
treatment -related  toxicities.  The NCI -CTCAE  grading  system  will be used for all  
adverse  events  except  for allergic reactions,  for which the  WHO  criteria  will be used.

Relationship  to Procedure Definitions  
Associated:  There is a reasonable  possibility  that the adverse event may have  been  
caused  by [CONTACT_130577]/or procedure.   This definition  applies  to those  adverse  
events  that are considered definitely,  probably  or possibly  related  to the  procedure.  
 
1. Definitely  related: An adverse event that follows  a temporal  sequence  from  
administration  of the test product  and/or procedure; follows  a known  response  
pattern  to the  test article  and/or procedure;  and, when appropriate to the  
protocol,  is confirmed  by [CONTACT_130578][INVESTIGATOR_130518] (positiv e 
re-challenge:  and by [CONTACT_130579]  
[positive  re-challenge]);  and cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_130580]’s  clinical  state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
2. Probably  related: An adverse event that follows  a reasonable temporal  
sequence  from  administration  of the test product  and/or  procedure;  follows  a 
known  response pattern  to the test product  and/or  procedure,  is confirmed  by 
[CONTACT_130581]-challenge;  and cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_130582]’s  clinical  state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
3. Possibly  related:  An adverse event that follows  a reasonable temporal;  
sequence  from  administration  of the test product  and/or  procedure and  follows  
a known  response  pattern  to the  test product  and/or  procedure,  but could  have 
been  produced  by [CONTACT_2299]’s  clinical  state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Not associated: An adverse event  for which  sufficient information  exists to  indicate that  
the etiology  is not related  to the test product  and/or  therapy.  
 
Unrelated: An adverse event that does not follow a reasonable temporal  sequence  after 
administration  of the test product  and/or procedure  and most likely  is explained  by [CONTACT_2416]’s  clinical  disease  state or by [CONTACT_130583][INVESTIGATOR_014].   In addition,  a negative  re- 
challenge to the  test article  and/or procedure  would  support  an unrelated  relationship.

12.5. Adverse Event  Reporting  
 
All adverse  events,  regardless  of perceived  relationship  to study  treatment,  will be 
reported  and recorded  on the appropriate Case Report Forms  (CFR  Title 21, 312.32).  
New AEs  and SAEs  that are ongoing  at the end of the study  will be followed  for 30 days 
from  the patient’s  receipt  of the last dose of protocol therapy,  unless  they have  resolved  
earlier.   SAEs  and treatment  related  AEs ongoing  at the end of study  will be followed  
until resolution.  
 
The AE description  will include the nature  of the experience,  the date of onset, the  
resolution  date,  the severity  of each sign or symptom reported  using grade  [ADDRESS_147510]  (IRB)  
according  to each board’s reporting  requirements  and required  time frame.

12.6. Safety Reporting  Requirements  for IND Holders  
 
Additional  reporting  requireme nts for the FDA in accordance with  the guidance set  
forth  in 21 CFR  212.32 are required.  Sponsor -investigators  of studies  conducted  
under an  IND will  comply  with the safety  reporting  requirements  outlined  below.  
 
12.6.1.  Expedited  IND Safety  Reports:  
 
Seven  calendar -day telephone  or fax report:  The Sponsor -Investigator is required  to 
notify  the FDA of any fatal or life-threatening  adverse event  that is unexpected  and 
assessed  by [CONTACT_130584].   An 
unexpected  adverse event is one  that is not already  described  in the  consent form.  
Such  reports  are to be  telephoned  or faxed to the  FDA within  [ADDRESS_147511] 
learning  of the event.   Each  telephone  call or fax transmission  (see fax number below)  
should be  directed  to the  FDA new drug review division in the  Center for  Drug  
Evaluation  and Research  or in the  product  review  division for the Center for Biologics  
Evaluation  and Research,  whichever is responsible  for the review of the IND.  
 
12.6.2.  Fifteen  calendar -day written  report:  
 
The Sponsor -Investigator  is also required  to notify  the FDA  and all participating  
investigators,  in a written  IND Safety  Report, of  any serious, unexpected  AE that is

Algorithm  for Dose  Adjustment Based  on Symptoms:  
 
A. For a Grade 1 reaction,  the daily  dose will be continued until the  next visit.  If a subsequent  
Grade 1 or greater reaction  occurs, the participant  will hold future doses  and return  to the  
clinic within  48 hours  and be challenged  to the  previous tolerated  dose.  
B. For a Grade 2 and 3 reaction, the  participant  will hold all future doses  and return  to the  clinic  
within  48 hours  to be  challenged  to the  previous tolerated  dose. If a Grade 3 reaction  occurs  
greater than  2 times,  the participant’s  dose will remain  at the highest  tolerated  dose and will 
enter the maintenance phase  of the study.  
C. Grade 4 reaction  will cause  discontinuation  of the study  for that patient  and the patient  will 
be given  the option to be  converted  to a peanut equivalent  dose.

appointment(s) will  be rescheduled.  
 
 Take one dose per day, preferably  at the same  time every  day. Prior to taking  the dose,  
you must eat a snack high in carbohydrate and  fat (example:  bagel,  chips) then eat the 
peanut  flour mixed in a  small  amount  of liquid (example:  less than 1 tablespoon (15 ml) 
of water,  apple juice  etc.) or mixed into another food  (example:  less than one half of a 
cup (8 tablespoons) of apple  sauce,  ice cream).  Liquid  or semi -solid  foods  can be mixed  
with the dose to facilitate  consumption.  
 
After eating  the flour,  your child  must be  with a supervising  adult  for the next 2 hours  so 
they can monitor  for any possible  reaction.  Your  child cannot  go to school,  go to bed, or 
take hot showers  within  2 hours  of eating  the peanut flour.  No strenuous  physical  activity  
during  the observation  period.  
 
 Travel  
o No international  traveling  is allowed  
o Domestic Traveling  within the  continental  U.S. 
 Take dose at the same time as place of origin  (i.e. dose time in Houston  
4pm, then take the dose at 4pm final destination)  
o No traveling  on cruise ships  
 
 Please ensure that the  vehicle  food that the peanut flour is mixed with is not food that 
your child  is allergic to. 
 
 Record  any symptoms occurring  within  2 hours  of taking  the daily  dose.  
 
 
Symptoms  to look for:  
Mild Symptoms  
(itching,  mild flushing,  sneezing,  nasal congestion,  eye itching,  swelling  of lips, 
hives/swelling  in one  or two areas  of the body,  nausea)

 Please use the Allergic Reaction  Treatment  Plan as a guide  during  an allergic  reaction.  
 
 Call and inform  the research  team  of any reaction  (even  mild cases) and  make  an 
appointment  to see the research  team for the following  day. 
 
 Please call  9-1-1 for severe  reactions  (example:  confusion, loss of  consciousness/non - 
responsive,  collapse,  incontinence, bluish skin, feeling  faint).  
 
 
 
If a daily dose  is missed:  
• Up to 2 days,  continue  doses  as scheduled.  
• 3-4 days after missed  dose; repeat  previous  doses but this dose  will be given  at [LOCATION_007]

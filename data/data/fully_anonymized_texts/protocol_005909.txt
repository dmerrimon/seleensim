I. Study Overview:  
 A. Summary : This is an Implementation/Effectiveness hybrid study, where Aim 1 evaluates the 
implementation process and Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of a clinic al protocol. The protocol in this 
study is a two step protocol to identify and manage geriatric syndromes in the Emergency Department 
(ED).  Step 1 is nurse screening for geriatric syndromes using three previously validated tools: the Brief 
Delirium Triage  Screen (Delirium screen), the [ADDRESS_312563] (4SBT), and the Identifying Seniors at 
Risk score (ISAR). Step 2 is management of patients who screen positive either by [CONTACT_257250][INVESTIGATOR_257240] (Obs Unit).   
For Aim 1, Implementation, the process will 
be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively.  
Data will be collected on the actions and 
perceptions of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]. The 
implementation procedures done will follow 
Lean Six Sigma proces ses, which is the 
standard implementation process of our 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42619].  We will also monitor the 
implementation process using aggregate 
quality data from the ED, currently already 
collected monthly as part of QI measures. No 
identifying information on s taff will be 
collected as part of the study.  
For Aim 2, Effectiveness, data will be collected 
prospectively from patient participants in before and after cohorts.   
 B. Intervention : The two -step intervention will begin with the patient’s primary ED nurse  
screening for geriatric syndromes. The ED physician will then determine if multidisciplinary intervention 
is needed and the appropriate level of care (eg, dementia may cause a positive delirium screen, but may 
not require evaluation if cognitive status is  at baseline). Patients requiring multidisciplinary assessment 
will be either admitted or assigned to the Obs Unit for geriatric assessments based on standard care of 
their medical problems. These assessments are in addition to usual care for the patient’s  underlying 
medical complaint. Geriatric consultation involves evaluation by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s geriatric consultation 
team: a board certified geriatrician, a geriatric nurse practitioner, and fellows. PT assessments are done 
by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_257241]. Medication review s are completed by [CONTACT_257251] 1: Study specific a bbreviations and definitions.

  v1.[ADDRESS_312565], however currently only 5% of older adults in  the ED are 
receiving the screening and only 11% are placed in the Obs Unit for further assessment.  Based on data 
from other institutions, this is likely an underutilized service and we are missing many older adults with 
acute needs. The goal of implement ation is to increase nurse screening to >80% and protocol 
compliance to >80%.   
 C.  Rationale for study:  The data collected for Aim [ADDRESS_312566] to do chart reviews to 
assess compliance t o our geriatric quality protocols.  The intervention in question is included as part of 
our geriatric protocols. This intervention is not "new", it has been ongoing since 2015.  However, a formal implementation process is needed as education and accreditat ion have not been able to increase 
our screening and compliance rates above 5%.  For this reason, [CONTACT_257261] took [ADDRESS_312567] of the protocol on patient centered outcomes.  
 
 
    
II. Aim 1 Protocols  
 A. Specific Aim
: Develop, implement, and sustain a two -step intervention providing ED geriatric 
assessments by [CONTACT_106814] 1) ED nurse -based screening for geriatric syndromes of all older ED patients 
with 2) multidisciplinary geriatric assessment in an ED Obs Unit. We will use mixed -methods approaches 
and the CFIR framework to identify resource, organizational, patient, staff, and administrativ e factors 
that affect protocol adherence.2-4  We will use Lean Six Sigma processes to overcome barriers. We will 
track effects of the protocol in reference to ED quality metrics, staff work flow, and work culture.  Table 2: Study Timeline

  v1.0 3- 11-2019  
Hypothesis 1a: Implementation: Lean Six Sigma processes will i) in crease ED nurse -based 
screening rates to >80% older adults in the ED and ii) increase protocol fidelity in the Obs Unit to 
>80%.  
Hypothesis 1b: Sustainability: After 6 months of >80% screening, we will characterize the 
necessary elements for sustainabilit y by [CONTACT_257252]. We hypothesize that attention to CFIR elements during implementation will result in 
routinization and institutionalization that does not significantly decrease with withdrawal or 
time, as a ssessed by [CONTACT_257253].5  
 B. Subjects:  Aim 1  will include analysis of aggregate ED EMR data on ED patients ≥65 overall (1a) 
and in the ED obs unit (1b). ED staff and L ean team members are also study subjects for Aim 1 . All ED 
and obs unit physicians, midlevel providers, nurses, pharmacists, and involved consultants/stakeholders 
are eligible, yielding an estimated 260 people. While staff participation in the implementation process 
and surveys is voluntary, participation in the education and protocol is mandatory.  
 
 C. Data Collection :  1) Monthly aggregate EMR data  on all ED patients is collected as part of 
general quality measures. This includes: Obs Unit census, patient  demographics, geriatric screening 
results,  consultation rates for the multidisciplinary geriatric services,  and dispositions from the ED . 2) 
Staff Surveys  will be sent electronically using REDCap (Vanderbilt University, TN).6,[ADDRESS_312568] 
2 types of staff surveys: the Implementation survey in Preparation and Implementation phases and the 
Sustainability scal e survey .  3) Observational data : Trained observers will perform work flow analyses 
per usual practice.[ADDRESS_312569] QI analysis done for QI purposes.  
 The only time that identifiable staff information will be used for research purposes will be using 
staff emails to send out surveys.  In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_257243], all surve ys sent to nursing staff will be 
approved by [CONTACT_257254]. Individual respondents ' emails will be used to 
allow for paired comparison of survey responses for the sustainability survey at [ADDRESS_312570] their work  opportunities  or be reported to their supervisors.  
Similarly, staff who are observed during workflow analyses will not ha ve their names reported, but 
instead will be listed as RN -A1, RN -A2, tech -A1, etc .  
 
 D. Aim 1 Timeline/ Methods:   
F.7.i: Preparation (3 months): Mirroring the normal process at our site, we will convene a Lean 
implementation team including: study PI, Obs Nurse Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], ED Nurse Educator, and representatives from pharmacy, safety, geriatrics, case management, and informatics. All perso nnel have prior Lean 
training/experience or will receive training. Standard Lean processes will be followed, such as use of a Gantt chart for task management. The Lean team will review current data and identify barriers to 
implementation. A staff survey (I mplementation Survey) will identify beliefs and domains for 
improvement. Based on prior studies using the CFIR,
2,[ADDRESS_312571] will be: 1) beliefs about 
capabilities, 2) professional role/identity; 3) barriers/facilitators to screening; 4) attitudes; and 5) social influences. Educ ation will consist of 2 hours of nurse training, led by [CONTACT_257255] (Peg Gulker) 
  v1.0 3- 11-2019  
who has Geriatric Emergency Nurse Education (GENE) certification.[ADDRESS_312572] nurse champi[INVESTIGATOR_257244] -
identify as interested in assisting with the process will also complete the GENE c ourse and/or online 
modules (Geri -EM.com).  
F.7.ii: Implementation (12 months):  We will use the Lean Six Sigma DMAIC process (Define, Measure, 
Analyze, Improve, and Control) and rapid cycles of process improvement. Key enablers and barriers will 
be identifi ed from the data obtained during Preparation. T eam workshops  will be used to g enerate 
solutions. These g enerated solutions are tested and results measured using aggregate EMR reports. 
These reports are summarized in the form of A3 sheets, tracked, a nd discussed during weekly team 
meetings, which can generate additional issues and new improvement cycles. At 6 months into this 
process, the Implementation Survey will be re -administered to assess changes and identify further 
areas of focus.  The implementation team will also assess the added burden to staff and look for any 
adverse outcomes on ED metrics, such as ED length of stay and admission rates.  
 F.7.iii: Maintenance and Sustainability (32 months) : Maintenance : After the goals of > 80% screening 
rate with > 80% protocol fidelity is achieved for 6 months, implementation will be considered successful. 
The Control/Maintenance phase of the DMAIC process begin. All new nurses and staff will receive the 
geriatric training. Existing staff w ill have annual training to review and reinforce their geriatric 
knowledge. The Lean team will continue to meet monthly, but rapid cycle process improvement will halt 
unless concerning trends are noted. Sustainability : At 12 and 24 months after Maintenance  phase 
initiation, we will assess the degree of routinization and institutionalization among all 180 ED nurses via 
a Sustainability survey (estimated response rate 70%).[ADDRESS_312573] results and any 
adaptations to the protocol. Reporting continued maintenance of a program as the only measure of 
sustainability is insufficient, as program adaptation may also signal further benefits or sustained improvement.

III. Aim 2 Protocol  
A. Specific Aim :  To reduce the decline in functional status and health related quality of life 
(HRQoL) commonly seen after older adults experience an ED visit .12-[ADDRESS_312574] implementation.  
 
Hypothesis 2a:  The intervention will reduce the decline in functional status seen after ED visits. 
Secondary outcomes include health -related quality of life, ED revisits, and results of the 
multidisciplinary assessments.  
 
Hypothesis 2b: Patients will be satisfied with the protocol as assessed by [CONTACT_257256].  
  
  v1.0 3- 11-2019  
 B. Participant Selection : Adults ≥65 years assigned to the Obs Unit at the discretion of the 
treating physician will be enrolled  (n=380) . Patients may be in Obs as part of an Obs protocol (e.g., chest 
pain) or in response to a positive geriatric screening test. Patients with delirium or dementia will be 
enrolled with an LAR and patient assent. Exclusion criteria are need for inpatient care, non -English 
speaking, acute psychiatric issues, prisoners, unable to follow -up, or unable to consent and no LAR.   
 Study person nel will monitor the Obs Unit electronic tracking board (7am -11pm M -F and select 
weekends) to identify an d recruit 380 patients ([ADDRESS_312575] cohorts) .  
 
 C. Data Collection : A survey and chart review will be completed during the Obs stay (Table  3). 
Follow up phone interviews will occur at days 30±3 and 90±5. In simulations  with research staff, survey 
completion required [ADDRESS_312576] methods (including training of abstractors, standardized forms, code book, etc).15  
   
 Data collection definitions:   
OARS:16 (Primary Outcome ) An assessment of activities of daily living (functional status) 
commonly used in ED studies. We will obtain 4 timepoints: Premorbid (patient report of 
function 1 week prior to ED visit), at the ED visit (day 0), and at days 30 and 90. A change of ≥3 
poin ts or death between is a significant decline.12,17 
HRQoL : The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement information System (P ROMIS) is 
endorsed by [CONTACT_257257]. We will use the Global Health v1.2 (10 questions). A 3 point 
change is clinically meaningful.18  
New services : Number of new or increased outpatient services (e.g., home health therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
referral for community interventions, equipment).  
New geriatric syndrome19 diagnoses of delirium, impaired cognition, fall risk, or elder 
mistreatment.  
Geriatric clinic referral : Referrals to the Falls Prevention, Polypharmacy, or Geriatrics Clinic.  
Pharmacist recommendations : Number of medication related problems/interac tions.1,20  
Positi ve geriatric interventions : ≥1 of: new services, diagnoses, referrals, or pharmacist recs.  
ED revisits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] : Any ED revisits or unscheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52090] 90 
days.21  
Patient satisfaction: interview data with  themes of positive patient outcomes or satisfaction.

 Qualitative data: At least [ADDRESS_312578] cohort will be selected for semi -structured 
interviews.  Interviews will be led by a trained researcher coordinator. Purposeful sampling will be used 
to provide a mix of genders, ages, and Obs Unit dispositions. To assess patient satisfaction, (Aim 2b), a 
trained researcher will conduct in -person, semi -structured interviews with intervention patients. In 
addition to Likert -type questions, we will solicit brief descriptions of clinical exemplars of how this 
intervention produced a positive patient outcome. See interview guide. Maximum variation/ 
heterogeneous purposive sampling will provide a mix of genders, ages, and observation dispositions.  
This interview will add an additional 20 minutes to the patient's participation time, and so we expect 
that some participants may decline this portion. With [ADDRESS_312579] 20 patients to participate in the qualitative data 
collection.   
 D. Follow up:   The participants will be followed for 90±5  days.  The follow up interviews will be 
done over the phon e. If the participant prefers, these can be scheduled by [CONTACT_257258].  Email reminders can also be sent if the participant prefers that 
communication strategy.  LAR or caregivers are invited to be present at d uring the follow up calls. If the 
participant and the LAR/caregiver give antithetical answers to a question, both answers will be recorded  
to track how often this occurs, but only the LAR's answers will be used for the final analysis. All 
participants will be mailed a Thank you Card from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_257245].  
 
IV. Data Analysis  
A.  Aim 1a outcome definition : Screening rate  is defined as the percentage of ED patients ≥ [ADDRESS_312580] documentation of all 3 screens  (4SBT, ISAR, Delirium). Protocol Fidelity  is the 
percentage of screen positive patients in the Obs Unit who receive all appropriate consultations  as 
noted on EMR data. Secondary outcomes include the number of cycles required to reach 80% screening, 
any pr otocol adaptions, and fidelity to Lean methods. Fidelity to Lean will be measured by (1) Lean 
documents, (2) completion of ≥2 rapid improvement cycles, and (3) representation from both  leadership 
and frontline employees at meetings.  
Aim 1b outcome definition : We will characterize the necessary elements to maintain screening 
rates >80%. We will use X -bar and R -charts to evaluate for special process variation as we withdraw 
implementation support. Any support withdrawal that leads to significant decre ase in screening rates 
will be considered necessary and the Lean team will address the problem. For sustainability, we will summarize and report the mean total and subsection scores at each timepoint. The main outcome is 
the change in scores over time. Sec ondarily, any mean subscores < 3.[ADDRESS_312581]  
- Home health and 
community resources used  
  v1.0 3- 11-2019  
Analysis:  Monthly summary statistics on geriatric patient visits, screening and consultation will 
be recorded. For Hypotheses 1a.i and1a.ii  (Implementation) we will calculate the proportions for 
screening rate and protocol fidelity with 95% CIs monthly using aggregate data. Success is predefined as 
a point estimate >80% for each outcome for 6 months. Th e Staff Implementation Surveys (both pre - and 
post -implementation) will be thematically analyzed u sed Atlas.ti (Cleverbridge, Inc, Chicago, IL) a 
qualitative data analysis program, and categorized within the CFIR framework. This data will be used to 
further the implementation process. Additional assessments of implementation will include: the number 
of improvement cycles, generated solutions and protocol adaptations, and Lean fidelity. Lean fidelity will 
be assessed as a yes/no variable at conclusion of implementation. For Hypothesis 1b, (Sustainability ) we 
will compare the total mean scores (primary ou tcome) between the 2 years taking into account linked 
responses by [CONTACT_257259] a mixed model.  We will compare individuals' scores 
over time using a paired t -test or Sign Rank test.   
 
B. Aim 2 : Participant representativeness will b e assessed by [CONTACT_257260]. The primary outcome  for Aim 2a is the proportion of patients in the pre and post cohort 
with a significant (≥3 point) decline in Functional Status (OARS) from day [ADDRESS_312582] (primary analysis). Also, 
logistic regression modeling will be used to compare the functional decline between the pre and post 
intervention groups univariately and while controlling for initial ED HRQoL, demographic factors (age, 
race, average socioeconomic status from zip code census tract), Charlson Comorbidity Index score,23 
number of services used and any other significant factors varying between the two cohorts.  The total 
number of covariates will not exceed 12, given we estimate 122 subjects with functional decline. A 
similar secondary analysis will be done using the 30 day timepoint data.  
Secondary outcomes for 2a: Dichotomous secondary outcomes will be analyzed using 
proportions and chi -square tests between pre - and post -intervention groups and with exploratory 
logistic regression models. Count data will be explored using  either Poisson or negative binomial 
regression. Exploratory analyses  will use similar methods to compare the pre -intervention group to the 
post - subgroup who received all [ADDRESS_312583] content analysis of the descriptions using phrases and sentences as our unit of 
analysis.24,25 We will categorize the exemplars and analyze for appropriateness and perceived outcomes 
based on the level of detail provided. Analysis will include open and axial c oding procedures using 
techniques of constant comparison and questioning within and across cases.26,27 The coding schema will 
be created with consensus on coding definitions and groupi[INVESTIGATOR_257246]/categories. Dua l 
coding with negotiated consensus will be performed on 20% of the data to add rigor to the analysis. 
Themes will be reported per current guidelines.28,29

6.7 Study-Drug 
Administration Study drug is to be administered to all patients in the clinic by [CONTACT_222344]. Study drug should be prepared in advance and injected subcutaneously according to the following instructions:  
•Remove study drug from refrigerated condition and
allow to warm to room temperature for 15 minutesprior to administration. Study drug should be
administered within 4 hours.
•Identify location for injections. Study drug may be
injected in the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh. All
injections administered at a single visit should begiven in the same area, but may be split up into
different areas for Week [ADDRESS_1220776] 4 injections/visit. Injection sites should be
≥10 cm from one another. If possible, injections
should not be administered at sites with active AD or
other skin lesions.
•Inject study drug subcutaneously.
•Record location of study injections in the eCRF.
•Properly dispose of used syringe according to site
requirements. Syringe box must be kept for full drugaccountability.Feedback from 
investigators indicated that patients may 
prefer not having 
4 injections given at the same site.

6.4. Study-Drug 
Unblinding The Sponsor or designee, the Investigator, study-site personnel, and the patient will be blinded to treatment assignment. The integrity of the clinical study will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_58956]. If 
knowledge of a patient’s treatment assignment is required for the patient’s clinical care and/or safety, the Investigator will open the Code-Breaking Card 
received with the study-drug kit. The Code-Breaking 
Card should be stored in a secure, locked location 
at the site. The Investigator should have access to 
the Code-Breaking Card at all times (e.g., 24/7) . is 
permitted to use the IWRS to obtain treatment 
assignment.  The Investigator should consult with the 
Sponsor’s medical monitor prior to obtaining treatment 
assignment information. The Investigator must 
document (in the patient’s medical record) the date and time the blind was broken, the names of the personnel involved, and the reason that treatment assignment information was required. Because of the secondary packaging used 
for the kits in this 
study, the CRO was unable to accommodate use of an IWRS 
system. Instead, 
in the event of an unblinding, Code-Breaking Cards will be used. 
6.7. Study-Drug Administration Study drug is to be administered to all patients in the clinic by [CONTACT_222344]. Study drug should be prepared in advance and injected subcutaneously according to the following instructions:

11.6. Exposure 
and Compliance The extent of exposure to study drug in each treatment group will be summarized by [CONTACT_874102], total number of applications, number of missed applications, and number and percentage of patients who are compliant. An application is 
considered the full set of injections (either 2 or 4 depending on visit) specified by [CONTACT_760].  
A patient will be considered compliant with the dosing 
regimen if the patient received ≥75% of the expected 
number of applications while enrolled in the study. Clarification

Change to Early-Termination visit.Changes to 
reconcile the Schedule of Visits and Procedures with the Study Procedures 
Appendix 5. Body Surface Area (BSA) The BSA assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin involvement with respect to AD and is expressed as a percentage of total body surface.  
Determine BSA using the patient’s palm = 1% rule.  The patient’s palm is measured from the wrist to the 
proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and thumb.  
Estimate the number of palms it takes to cover the 
affected AD area. Add up the number of palms to give a total estimate of the area covered in AD.  
Below are estimates when entire areas (anterior and 
posterior)  are covered:  
Head and Neck = 10% (10 palms) Upper Extremities = 20 % (20 palms) 
Trunk (axillae and groin) = 40
30% (4030 palms) 
Lower extremities (buttocks) = 40 % (40 palms) BSA scores 
adjusted to sum to 100%.

Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 16 Confidential 1 BACKGROUND 
1.1 Atopic Dermatitis 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a relapsing and remitting inflammatory skin diso rder that aff
ects all age 
groups.1 It is chronic and incurable, and is characterized by [CONTACT_49230]-barrier disruption and immune 
dysregulation (largely mediated by [CONTACT_24975]-2 helper T cells).1 Clinically, AD is characterized by 
[CONTACT_143205], erythematous crusted eruption (dermatosis), lichenification, an impaired skin barrier, 
and intense pruritus.[ADDRESS_1220787] common dermatologic diseases—15 ‒30% of children and 2 ‒10% of adults are 
affected, and prevalence appears to have increased over the past two to three decades.4 
There appears to be some geographic variability in prevalence. Prevalence in children has been estimated to be 5.9 ‒16.0% in Western Europe and 10.7% in the [LOCATION_002] (US)
5, 6 In adults, 
prevalence has been reported as 0.3 ‒2.0% in Europe, 4.9% in the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]), and 
2.4‒6.0% in the US.[ADDRESS_1220788] to disease severity, 14% of AD patients in the [LOCATION_006] have 
moderate disease and 2% have severe disease.8 A recent US study measuring AD severity in 
children found that for 67% disease was mild, for 26% it was moderate, and for 7% it was severe.
9 Approximately 85% of all cases of AD begin before age 5, with up to 70% of children 
having spontaneous remission before adolescence.[ADDRESS_1220789] a high disease burden and their quality of life (QoL) is significantly affected. In one study, AD was shown to have a greater negative effect on patient mental health than diabetes and hypertension.
[ADDRESS_1220790] lower physica l vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, 
and mental health scores.11 
The therapeutic approach to AD primarily consists of trigger avoidance, skin hydration with 
bathing, and use of emollients and anti-inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143182] (TCS). In many patients, treatment with TCS provides some measure of 
symptomatic relief but does not adequately control the disease. 
In those patients who have persistent moderate- to-severe disease not responding adequately to 
TCS, guidelines outline several step-up therapeutic options.12, 13 The step-up options include 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726] (TCIs), phototherapy, and immunosuppressive agents such as oral 
corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil. Among 
these, only cyclosporine is approved for treatm ent of moderate-to-severe AD (nationally 
licensed in many European countries, but not in the U.S.), and its use is limited to patients 
≥16 years for a maximum treatment period of 8 weeks (Neoral®). Recently, the anti-IL-4R agent, 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_874091], was approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_874091]’s mechanism 
of action is likely through inhibition of heterodimerization of the IL-4R α/IL-13Rα1 complex, 
preventing IL-13 from initiating downstream  signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway.

Lebrikizumab DRM06-AD01-A2 
Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 17 Confidential 1.2 Lebrikizumab 
Lebrikizumab is a humanized monoclonal immunogl obulin (Ig) G4 antibody (huIgG4) with a 
mutation in the hinge reg
ion for increased stability. Lebrikizumab binds specifically to soluble 
human interleukin (IL)-13 with high affinity, and potently inhibits IL-13 signaling through the 
IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 complex. Because lebrikizumab binds to IL-13 in a non-receptor binding 
domain (i.e., a portion of the molecule not involved in binding to its receptor), antibody-bound IL-13 can still bind its receptor (IL-13 Rα 1), but the receptor complex is not activated.  
Because lebrikizumab does not bind to IL-[ADDRESS_1220791] commonly used species for 
animal models of AD, it was not possible to perform in vivo lebrikizumab pharmacology or efficacy studies in an animal model of AD. However, several non-clinical studies in the literature demonstrate increased expression of IL-13 in affected skin, supporting the use of an anti-IL-13 therapeutic for human AD.  
Two previous studies were conducted with lebrikizumab in patients with AD. They are described 
in Section 1.3.2. See the Lebrikizumab Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for additional det ails on 
lebrikizumab non-clinical and clin
ical studies. 
1.3 Study Rationale and Benefit-Risk Assessment 
1.3.1 Scientific Rationale: Evidence of the Role of IL-13 in AD 
AD is a T-helper type 2 (Th-2)-driven inflammato ry disease. Several lines of evidence from 
published literature implicate IL-13 a s
 a key component of AD pathobiology: 
• Genetic studies have shown that polymorphisms in the gene for IL-13,14, 15 and in the 
IL-4Rα receptor16 are associated with an increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_201314]. 
• IL-[ADDRESS_1220792] on keratinocytes in the skin to downregulate their differentiation;17 and to 
induce T-cell chemoattractants that mediate T cell infiltration into AD lesions.18  
• Il-13 may induce IL-5 expression and eosinophil infiltration through the induction of 
eosinophil chemoattractants.19 
• IL-13 can reduce epi[INVESTIGATOR_874092], loricrin, and 
involucrin.20 
• IL-13 can mediate fibrosis through the induction of collagen production in fibroblasts.21 
• In an epi-cutaneous ovalbumin sensitization model of murine AD, topi[INVESTIGATOR_900]-sense 
oligonucleotides targeting mouse IL-13 mRNA  were shown to significantly reduce the 
production of IL-13 in the skin and in turn significantly reduce inflammation.22 
• Increased IL-[ADDRESS_1220793] reported an increase in IL-13 expressing T cells in the blood of AD patients.23-25  
• Increased expression of IL-13 in AD skin has been reported.26-31 
• Increased levels of IL-[ADDRESS_1220794] a 
relationship between IL-13 expression and the severity of disease.25 
• Clinical studies investigating agents with broadly acting anti-inflammatory activity 
demonstrated that reduced IL-13 expression was associated with clinical improvement.

Laboratory test results will be provided to the sites through a web-based reporting system. Alert values will be emailed to the site. Laboratory data will be transferred to the clinical database from the central laboratory database.  
Screening laboratory test results must be reviewed by [CONTACT_874116]. Patients will fail screening for clinically significant laboratory values. However, at the 
discretion of the Investigator, screening laboratory tests may be repeated one time to confirm out-of-range results or clinical significance. Specific laboratory tests are listed in Table 2.  
The central laboratory should be use d for all laboratory testing required f or a patient 
during 
study participation, including laboratory testing needed for unscheduled visits. Clinically 
significant laboratory results must be entered as a diagnosis on the AE eCRF rather than as an 
individual test result. Patients with clinically significant laboratory test results will be evaluated, treated and followed at the discretion of the Investigator until the value returns to clinically acceptable levels. 
Throughout the study, all laboratory results should be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_46698] 48 hours of receipt of the report (whenever possible).

9.1.5 Adverse Events (AEs) 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with th
e use of a study drug 
in humans, whether considered drug related. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including clinically significant  abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or 
disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether related to the investigational product.  
AEs will be monitored throughout the study. Patients will be instructed to inform the Investigator 
and/or study staff of any AEs. At each visit, patients will be asked about AEs in a non-specific manner using open-ended questions so as not to bias the response (e.g., How have you been 
since the last visit?). Specific inquiry regarding reported AEs will be conducted when applicable. 
All AEs will be documented and recorded in the patient’s eCRF. 
Any patient who has an AE (serious or non-serious) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_143226](s) return to normal or to clinically acceptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_737]. A physician, either at clinical site, or at a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_121376], will administer treatment for any serious  AEs (SAEs), if necessary. When appropriate, 
medical tests and examinations will be perform ed to document resolution of event(s). 
Dermira, Inc. 
Lebrikizumab DRM06-AD01-A2 
Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 35 Confidential [IP_ADDRESS] Reporting 
Only AEs that occur during or following study treatment with the study drug will be reported in 
the AE section of the eCRF. Events recorded prio r to study treatment with the drug will be 
reported in t
he Medical History section of the eCRF. All AEs occurring during the study will be 
individually recorded in the eCRF. Any condition present prior to administration of study drug 
and that worsens after administration of study drug should be reported as an AE. Information regarding the onset, duration, severity, action taken, outcome, and relationship to study drug will be recorded.  
New or worsening abnormal laboratory values and/or vital signs are to be recorded as AEs if 
they are considered to be of clinical significance by [CONTACT_294729] 9.1.6. Unless a diagnosis is available, signs and symptoms must be reported as individual AEs in the eCRF; a diagnosis is preferred.  
The severity of an AE will be designa ted as mild, 
moderate or severe. The term “severe” is used 
to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor clinical 
significance (e.g., ‘severe’ upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_28299]). Severity is not the same as “serious”. 
Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome/action of an AE. (See Section 9.1.6.) 
The relationship of the AE to the stu
dy treatment should be determined by [CONTACT_143228]: 
Not related: The AE is judged to not be associated with the study drug, and is attributable to another cause. 
Related: A causal relationship between the AE and the study drug is a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., there is evidence (e.g., dechallenge/rechallenge) or other clinical arguments to suggest a causal relationship between the AE and study treatment.  
9.1.6 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that,  
• Results in d
eath 
• Is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_16737] (i.e., the patient is at 
immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1666] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening, result in 
death, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on appropriate medical judgment, it jeopardizes the patient, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed. 
The Investigator should institute any clinically  necessary supplementary investigation of SAE 
information. In the case of patient death, any post-mortem findings/reports will be requested. 
Dermira, Inc. 
Lebrikizumab DRM06-AD01-A2 
Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 36 Confidential [IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of SAEs 
All SAEs, as defined in Section 9.1.6, regardless of causal re
lationship, must be repor ted to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. As soon 
as the Investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the criteria for an SAE, the SAE should 
be documented to the extent that information is available.  
SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent/assent until the end of the study. 
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], an SAE occurring outside the specified time window  (i.e., following patient completion or terminations of the study) is deemed to be drug-related, the event should be reported with [ADDRESS_1220821] be recorded on an SAE form. The minimum information required for SAE reporting 
includes the identity of the PI, site number, patient number, event description, SAE term(s), reason why the event is considered serious (i.e., the seriousness criteria), and PI’s assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug. Additional SAE information including medications or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, and the outcome/resolution of the event 
should also be recorded on the SAE form. 
In all cases, the Investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all 
material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the SAE. The Investigator may be required to provide supplementary information as requested by [CONTACT_4885]. 
When reporting SAEs, the following additional points should be considered: 
• Although signs, symptoms, and tests that support the diagnosis of an SAE should be 
provided, the Investigator should report t he diagnosis or syndrome as the SAE term. 
• Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE (unless 
the event preceding the death is unknown). If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy 
report should be provided. 
Although most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_874095], some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143191]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_874096], or for a procedure for a pre-
existing condition that has not worsened after administration of study drug (e.g., a 
previously scheduled ventral hernia repair).  SAEs must, however, be reported for any 
surgical or procedural complication that lead to prolongation of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Events that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143193] <24 hours and that do not require a 
therapeutic intervention/treatment (e.g., an emergency room visit for hematuria that results in a diagnosis of cystitis and discharge to home on oral antibiotics). 
The Sponsor will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are received. For each 
SAE received, the Sponsor will determine whether the criteria for expedited reporting to relevant 
regulatory authorities have been met.  
The Sponsor will assess the likel ihood that each SAE is related to study treatment, with the 
current Investigator’s Brochure used as the reference document to assess expectedness of the 
event to study drug.

If the study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034], all data available for the patient at the time of discontinuation must be recorded in the patient’s records and the eCRF. 
10.2 Early Termination of Study Patients 
The Investigator will make every reas onable effort to keep each patient in t he study. However, 
patients may terminate 
or be terminated early from the study for the following reasons: 
• Voluntarily withdrawal of consent to participate in the study participation, at any time 
• Adverse event, laboratory abnormality or inter-current illness which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], indicates that continued treatment and/or participation in the study is not in 
the best interest of the patient 
• Serious protocol violation, persistent non-compliance or requirement for medication or 
procedure prohibited by [CONTACT_760] 
• Lost to follow-up 
Patients who are terminated early from study will have an Early-Termination visit scheduled 
(Section 7.4) as soon as possible . All information, including t he reason fo r early discontinuation 
will be recorded in the patient’s study records and in the eCRF.  
Before a patient can be terminated early due to loss of follow-up, the Investigator must show 
documented attempts to contact [CONTACT_874117] (telephone contact) followed by a certified letter of contact.

ing: 
• Inter-current illness that would, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant degree 
• Treatment related AEs that are clinically significant, deemed persistent, in the judgment 
of the Investigator 
• Unacceptable toxicity 
• Pregnancy 
Patients who discontinue study drug permanently  during study participation must be scheduled 
for an Early-termination visit (Section 7.4).  
11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 General Statistical Methodology 
All statistical  processing will be perfo
rmed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. No interim 
analyses are planned.  
Except where noted, all statistical tests will be two-sided and will be performed at the 0.[ADDRESS_1220827] finished Week 32. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety results. 
For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of patients in each category will be presented. The denominator for percentage will be based on the number of patients appropriate 
for the analysis. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include the number of 
patients (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, and range. Appropriate inferential statistics will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy variables. 
For the primary efficacy variable, the primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be 
the method of MCMC multiple imputation. This method does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random. Additionally, imputation will be conducted within each treatment group 
independently so the pattern of missing observations in one treatment group cannot influence 
missing value estimations in another.  
For binary responses related to EASI and IGA, t he binary response variables will be calculated 
based on the multiply imputed datasets that have been created. Because the MCMC algorithm 
is based on the multivariate normal model, imputed values for IGA will not generally be one of 
the discrete values used in IGA scoring (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). Therefore, to derive the binary IGA 
response variable, standard rounding rules will be applied to the imputed values. For example, if a patient has a IGA score imputed as 1.4 (and assuming a Baseline IGA score of 3), the imputed value would be rounded down to 1, and the minimum change from Baseline of [ADDRESS_1220828] been met. This patient would be considered a responder.

Sensitivity analyses on some of the secondary efficacy variables will be performed as follows: 
• Non-response imputation (NRI) will be used to impute missing values. Specifically, 
any patient with a missing IGA (or EASI75) value at Week 16 will be treated as a 
non-responder for analysis purposes. 
• Demographic data will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070]. 
Patients’ baseline characteristics related to efficacy analyses will be compared with 
descriptive statistics among treatment groups to determine whether the results are directly comparable. 
• The number of patients in each analysis set will be summarized. Reasons for study 
withdrawal during the blinded study will be summarized using frequencies and percentages by [CONTACT_1570]. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate 
document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the treatment groups. 
11.2 Populations Analyzed 
Patients will be randomized in a 3:3:3:2 ratio to ea ch treatment group. There will be 
approximate
ly 75 patients for groups with study drug, and 50 patients for the placebo group.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population and the 
per-protocol (PP) population. The mITT population will include all patients who were randomized and received study drug. The PP population will include all patients in the safety population who completed the Week 16 evaluation without any significant protocol violations (i.e., any patient or 
Investigator activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the 
treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). 
Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. All patients who are randomized 
and receive ≥ 1 dose of study drug will be included in the safety population.

Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 40 Confidential 11.3 Primary Efficacy 
The following primary endpoint will be analyzed: 
• 
Percent change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) from Baseline to Week 16. 
11.4 Secondary Efficacy 
The following secondary endpoints will be analyzed: 
• Proportion of patients wit
h a 75% improvement from Baseline in EASI (EASI75) at 
Week 16. 
• Proportion of patient with an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and a reduction 
≥2 points from Baseline to Week 16.  
• Proportion of patients with EASI <7 at Week 16. 
• Proportion of patients achieving EASI50 and EASI90 at Week 16. 
• Percent change in sleep-loss numerical rating scale (NRS) score from Baseline to 
Week 16. 
• Percent change in pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS) score from Baseline to 
Week 16. 
• Proportion of patients with pruritus NRS change of ≥3 from Baseline to Week 16. 
• Proportion of patients with pruritus NRS change of ≥4 from Baseline to Week 16. 
• Change in Body Surface Area (BSA) involv ed with AD from Baseline to Week 16. 
11.5 PK Analysis 
Plasma concentration d ata will be tabulated and summarized (geometric mean, arithmetic 
mean, mini
mum, maximum, SD, and % coefficient of variation) by [CONTACT_874118]. 
The planned PK analysis will be included in a separate Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan. 
11.6 Exposure and Compliance 
The extent of exposure to study drug in each treatment group will be summarized by [CONTACT_555782], total n umber of application
s, number of missed applications, and 
number and percentage of patients who are compliant. An application is considered the full set of injections (either 2 or 4 depending on visit) specified by [CONTACT_760].  
A patient will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the patient received ≥75% of 
the expected number of applications while enrolled in the study. 
11.7 Adverse Events 
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and cod ed using the
 MedDRA dictionary. 
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with an onset date on or after the date of 
the first application. TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], including the number of patients reporting an event, system organ class, pr eferred term, severity, relationship to study 
drug, and seriousness for the safety population. All serious AEs as well as AEs that led to study discontinuation will be listed by [CONTACT_4676].

From: Hanifin JM and Rajka G. Diagnostic features of atopic dermatitis. Acta Derm Venereol 
(Stockholm) 1980; Suppl 92:44 −7. 
To establish a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis the patient requires the presence of at least 
3 “basic features” and [ADDRESS_1220840] three or more basic features: 
• Pruritus 
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_22784]  
• Flexural lichenification or linearity in adults 
• Chronic or chronically-relapsing dermatitis 
• Personal or family history of atopy (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis) 
Minor Features  
Plus, three or more minor features: 
• Xerosis 
• Ichthyosis, palmar hyperlinearity, or keratosis pi[INVESTIGATOR_22785] 
• Immediate (type 1) skin-test reactivity 
• Elevated serum IgE

Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 51 Confidential Appendix 3. Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) 
For IGA scoring, the Investigator should evaluate the patient's extent and severity of AD at a 
macroscopic level; i.e., without focusing on specific components of AD, which will be quantitated 
in the EASI score. In doing so, the investigator will use the table below to provide the IGA score. 
Score Grade Definition 
0 Clear Minor, residual discoloration; no erythema or 
induration/papulation; no oozing/crusting; no edema. 
[ADDRESS_1220841] Clear Trace, faint pi[INVESTIGATOR_555747]/papulation and no oozing/crusting; no edema. 
2 Mild Faint-pi[INVESTIGATOR_874100]/crusting; minimal induration. 
3 Moderate Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]-red erythema with definite edema of skin papules and plaques; there may be some oozing/crusting; palpable 
induration. 
4 Severe Deep/bright red erythema with significant swelling and obvious raised borders of papules and plaques with oozing/crusting; significant induration.

Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 53 Confidential Appendix 5. Body Surface Area (BSA) 
The BSA assessment estimates the extent of diseas e or skin involvement with respect to AD 
and is expressed as a percentage of total body surface.  
Determine BSA using the patient’s palm = 1% rule.  
The patient’s palm is measured from the wrist to the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and thumb.  Estimate the number of palms it takes to cover the affected AD area. Add up the number of 
palms to give a total estimate of the area covered in AD.  
Below are estimates when entire areas (anterior and posterior) are covered: 
Head and Neck = 10% (10 palms) 
Upper Extremities = 20% (20 palms) 
Trunk (axillae and groin) = 30% (30 palms) Lower extremities (buttocks) = 40% (40 palms) TOTAL BSA = 100% (100 palms) 
Additional rules: 
1. When many small lesions are present, try to put several together to make one patient 
palm. 
2. Only include the edge of current lesions, not areas that have cleared. 3. Double check to see if area derived matches eyeball method.

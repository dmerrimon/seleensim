Trial  Design  
 
                    This is a multisite  trial to evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of 
GWP42003-P in patients with IS who have failed to become 
spasm -free following treatment with 1  or more approved IS 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( i.e., any therapy for the treatment of IS approved in 
Europe or the [LOCATION_002] (US) [e.g., steroids and/or vigabatrin (VGB )]).  All approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_312844]’s parent(s)/legal representative before the patient is considered for the trial (discussions regarding treatment options must be documented).   
The trial will comprise of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_312845], followed by a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338], with a 1 year open- label extension available to all 
patients who c omplete either phase. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_312846]- label with 2 sequential cohorts of 5 patients ( aged  between 
[ADDRESS_385267] cohort and between 1 and 24 months in the second cohort), who will receive GWP42003- P for 2 week s
.  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_312847] e will comprise 192 patients , aged 1 –24 months, 
who will undergo a 2-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment p eriod .  
An independent data safety monitoring committee ( DSM C) will 
be used throughout the study; they will consider safety of the patients and will confirm doses and dose regimens to be investigated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338], as well as the plans for dose titration .  
Patients  will enter the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312848] s (Visit 1, Da y −7 to Day −1) for assessment of 
eligibility , which includes a prolonged video- EEG .  Patients who

GWP42003-P (pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] ) or randomized to GWP42003-P (1 of 
2 dose levels) or placebo at a 1:1:1  ratio ( pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] ) (Visit 2, 
Day 1 [+ 3 days] ). The High Dose Level will be as recommended 
by [CONTACT_6802] ; the Low Dose Level will be defined as 50%  of the 
High Dose Level. Patients in the placebo group will be split into 
2 equivalent cohorts: half receiving Low Dose Level dosing volumes and half receiving High Dose Level dosing volumes.  Following baseline assessments , patients will titrate the 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) in 10 mg/kg/day increments to the target dose level  (or equivalent  volume of 
placebo  in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338]) and will continue at this dose, or the 
highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 40 mg/kg/day,  for the 
remainder of the 2- week treatment phase.  Patients in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312849] 4- day 
titration  period.  If deemed safe by [CONTACT_6802] , then it is planned 
for those in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312850] .  
Further c linic-based  assessments will take place a fter 3 days ’

(Visit 4, Day  15 [+3 days] ) or earlier if they withdraw 
prematurely .  All  patients who complete treatment will then have 
the opportunity to receive GWP42003-P during the subsequent 
OLE phase.  The OLE  phase will last for a maximum of 1 year.
 
Patients who enter the OLE phase will remain on the same dose 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] ) or will transition  to their  target dose of GWP42003- P 
over 4 days in a blin ded manner  (pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338]).  Patients  may 
continue at this dose, or the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 40 mg/kg/day,  for the remainder of the OLE phase.  
GWP42003-P may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator.  During the OLE phase , clinic visits will take place 
on Day  19 (Visit 5 [+1  day]), Day  29 (Visit 6 [±3  days] ), Day  43 
(Visit 7 [±3  days]), Day 71 (Visit 8 [±3  days]), Day 127 (Visit  9 
[±7 days]),  Day  211 (Visit 10 [±7  days]),  and on Day 295 
(Visit 11 [±7  days]) .  Patients will return to the site  for an end of 
OLE treatment  visit on Day 379 (Visit  12 [±7  days])  or earlier if 
they withdraw prematurely from the OLE phase.   
Following end of treatment, withdrawal, or discontinuation of IMP, a ll patients will taper  the IMP over 10 days followed by

basis (64 per treatment group).  Patients in the placebo group will 
be further split into 2 cohorts (32 patients receiving High Dose Level  volumes and 32 patients receiving Low Dose Level  
volumes), but it is assumed that these 2 cohorts can be pooled for the analyses of efficacy.  Assuming a 20% screen failure rate, it is expected that approximately 245 patients will need to be screened to achieve this target.   
 
 
 
 
 
  This is based on a 2- sided 5% significance level,

2.1 Primary  
2.1.1  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_312873], tolerable dose and dosing regimen of GWP42003- P 
in infants with Infantile Spasms (IS) , to be utilized in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312841]- label 
extension (OLE).   
To assess the number and proportion of patients considered treatment responders, 
defined as those free of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia , at the end of the 
2-week treatment period. 
Note: Resolution of hypsarrhythmia requires reduction of the electroencephalography 
(EEG ) background below 300 µV AND elimination of any electrodecrements or 
epochs of discontinuity. Persistence of some background slowing and interictal epi[INVESTIGATOR_312874] m discharges may be seen and still be consistent with resolution of 
hypsarrhythmia.

symmetrical contractions of the muscles of the neck, trunk, and extremities  which can 
be accompanied by a brief loss of consciousness.  The spasms can be divided into 
3 types depending on which muscle groups are predominantly affected (flexor, 
extensor, or mixed flexor –extensor).  The most common are mixed flexor– extensor 
spasms and flexor spasms, which account for 50% and 42% of seizures, respectively2.  
Individual spasms are often brief and normally comprise an initial phasic component 
lasting 1 –2 seconds followed by a less intense but more sustained tonic contraction3.  
They frequently occur in clusters, which can consis t of as few as 2 or > 100 spasms, 
with 3 –30 seconds between each individual spasm3,4.  Less common spasms include 
extensor spasms of the legs and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], simple head nodding, and (rarely) asymmetrical spasms
1,5.  The most characteristic EEG pattern of IS is 
hypsarrhythmia, which classically consists of random, high-voltage (> 200 μV), 
nonsynchronous spi[INVESTIGATOR_312877]- wave activity  in all cortical areas that varies from 
moment to moment in duration and location3.  However, in some cases of IS, 
hypsarrhythmia may be modified/atypi[INVESTIGATOR_312878]1,6.  Where present, the 
hypsarrhythmic EEG pattern most frequently occurs  during non- rapid eye movement 
sleep, and is greatly reduced or absent during clinical attacks of epi[INVESTIGATOR_59666] (ictal electrodecrement) and during rapid eye movement  sleep
1,3.  The association of 
clustered epi[INVESTIGATOR_312879], with or without atypi[INVESTIGATOR_117616], 
constitute a subset of IS known as West syndrome1.  Other subsets of IS include IS 
without hypsarrhythmia, in which clustered epi[INVESTIGATOR_312880], and IS single-spasm variant (with or without 
hypsarrhythmia), in which no clustering of epi[INVESTIGATOR_312881]1.  The incidence 
of IS ranges from 0.16 to 0.42 per 1,000 live births  with a prevalence of 1.4 –2.0 per 
10,000 children aged 10 years or younge r7,8.  Boys are affected slightly more often 
than girls (60:40 ratio)3. 
Although epi[INVESTIGATOR_312882], the onset of IS 
almost always occurs within the first 2  years of life (90% of patients presenting within 
the first year), with peak onset between 3 and 7 months of age1,3.  In some patients, 
onset of IS may be preceded by [CONTACT_312997][INVESTIGATOR_41711],

(often within the first 2  weeks) and is associated with a suppression- burst EEG 
pattern9.  Approximately 75% of patients with Ohtahara syndrome progress to 
develop West syndrome within the first [ADDRESS_385288] syndrome in only 2.6% of cases11.  The 
spasms characteristic of IS are refractory to treatment with most conventional antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (AEDs) and although they almost always resolve with time 
(usually by 2  years of age), the long-term prognosis is poor
4.  More than half of 
children with IS develop other forms of severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_312883]–Gastaut 
syndrome (LGS; an epi [INVESTIGATOR_312884] a slow spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]- and-wave EEG pattern12), and the majority (80–90%) manifest some 
degree of mental retardation, often accompanied by [CONTACT_282859] - and behavior al problems2. 
IS is associated with a wide range of underlying etiologies and there is growing evidence that IS result s from disturbances in key genetic pathways of brain 
development
13.  One of the most common specific underlying disorders is tuberous 
sclerosis  complex (TSC) , diagnosed in approximately 5 –7% of children with IS14.  
TSC is characterized by [CONTACT_312998] (tubers) in multiple 
organ systems that results from inadequate suppression of mammalian target of 
rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling  due to inactivating mutations in either of 2 tumor 
suppressor genes ( TSC1 and TSC2)15.  Around 40% patients diagnosed with TSC 
present with IS16 and it has been suggested that IS may occur when the mTOR 
pathway is perturbed in a specific neuronal population at a key neurodevelopmental 
stage13.  Other brain malformations , such as lissencephaly , can also underlie IS.  The 
[ADDRESS_385289] commonly associated with classic lissencephaly ( PAFAH1B1  and DCX ) 
are strongly associated with IS, which is prevalent in up to 80% of children with PAFAH1B1 mutations or deletions
13.  Both PAFAH1B1 and DCX  are expressed in 
inhibitory interneurons; thus, lissencephaly- associated IS may be due to deficits in 
this neuronal population rather than the cortical malformation per se13.  Collectively, 
congenital brain malformations (including TSC) are the underlying etiology in around 15% of IS cases
14.  Congenital chromosomal abnormalities (genomic imbalances) can 
also predispose to IS, the most common being Down syndrome (trisomy 21) which is 
the underlying etiology in approximately 5% of children with IS14.  Inversely, only 
around 3% of Down syndrome patients present with IS17.  With the exception of 
PAFAH1B1 deletion in Miller –Dieker syndrome18, the biological mechanism(s) of IS 
in syndromes of genomic imbalance are not known.  As well as underlying congenital

disorders, IS is associated with a range of extrinsic etiologies.  Pre -, peri- and 
postnatal brain injuries, inclu ding hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy, stroke, 
periventricular leukomalacia/ hemorrhage, and infection, cumulatively account for 
around one- quarter of cases of IS14.  Other etiologies have been identified, such as 
specific endocrine or metabolic disorders, but these are individually uncommon.  In 
approximately one-third of IS cases no evidence of a neurologic disorder is found14.  
Importantly, the underlying etiology is the most important factor affecting developmental outcome
19. 
Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), also known as corticotropin, is a 
long- established therapy for IS and was approved by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food and 
Drug A dministration (FDA) in 2010 (as H.P. Acthar® Gel) as monotherapy in infants 
and children under 2 years  of age.  Cosyntropin (known outside the US as 
tetracosactide) is a synthetic alternative and consists of the first 24  amino acids 
occurring in ACTH.  Currently, synthetic ACTH is not approved by [CONTACT_312999], although orphan drug designation was granted for tetracosactide (as 
Synacthen
® Depot) in 2012.  An early randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared 
ACTH (20 –30 international units [ IU]/day) with the oral corticosteroid prednisone 
(2 mg/kg/day) in 24  patients with IS20.  In the initial phase of the trial (prior to 
crossover), 5 of the 12 patients (42%) treated with ACTH were both spasm- and 
hypsarrhythmia -free after 2 –6 weeks’ treatment compared with 4  of the 12 patients 
(33%) treated with prednisone.  Furthermore, of the 8 non-responders who received prednisone, 4 (50%) responded after crossover to ACTH.  A later RCT compared a 
larger dose of ACTH (150  IU/m
2/day; n= 15) with prednisone (2 mg/kg/day; n= 14) 
and demonstrated that 87% of patients taking ACTH were both spasm- and 
hypsarrhythmia -free after 2  weeks’ treatment compared with 29% of patients taking 
prednisone21.  Of the 10 non-responders who received prednisone, 9 received ACTH 
and 8 (88%) responded.  Tetracosactide (0.50–0.75 mg [40 –60 IU] every 2  days; 
n=25) was compared with prednisolone (the active form of prednisone; 40–
60 mg/day; n= 30) for the t reatment of IS in a later RCT which excluded patients with 
a diagnosis or high risk of TSC22.  After 2  weeks’ treatment, 76% of patients who 
received tetracosactide were spasm -free compared with 70% of patients who rec eived 
prednisolone.  In those for whom it was measured, resolution of hypsarrhythmia occurred in 89% of the responders to tetracosactide compared with 71% of the 
responders to prednisolone.  A recent RCT comparing ACTH (40–60 IU every 2  days; 
n=44) with prednisolone (40–60 mg/day; n= 48) for the treatment of hypsarrhythmia 
in West syndrome not due to TSC demonstrated a significantly greater improvement 
with prednisolone compared with ACTH after 2 weeks’ treatmen t

EudraCT Number: 2015- 004904- [ADDRESS_385290] demonstrated that cessation  of spasms and disappearance of 
hypsarrhythmia  occurred in 14 of 24 patients (58%) treated with low- dose ACTH 
(20–30 IU/day for 2 –6 weeks, followed by a 1-week taper period) compared with 
13 of 26 patients (50%) treated with high-dose ACTH (150 IU/m2/day f or 3 weeks, 
followed by a 9- week taper period )25.  Similarly, in a separate RCT in [ADDRESS_385291] syndrome, a good initial response was observed in 60% of patients treated 
with low -dose ACTH (0.4 IU/kg/day f or 2 weeks, increased to 1.0 IU/kg/day if no 
response was seen, followed by a 2 -week taper period) compared with 53% of 
patients treated with high -dose ACTH (50 IU/day for 2  weeks, followed by a 2- week 
taper period)26.  In a RCT comparing low-dose tetracosactide (0.005 mg/kg/day, 
equivalent to 8 IU/kg/day natural ACTH; n= 13) with high-dose tetracosactide 
(0.2 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 40 IU/kg/day natural ACTH; n= 13), 75% of low-dosed 
patients were both spasm- and hypsarr hythmia -free after 2 weeks’ treatment  
compared with 85% of high-dosed patients27.  Due to the similar efficacy between 
doses, it was recently recommended that low-dose ACTH should be considered as an 
alternative to  high -dose ACTH for the treatment of IS24.  Although ACTH is the 
preferred treatment for short -term control of IS24,28, side effects are common and 
long-term exposure is associated with serious adverse events (SAEs), including 
fulminant infections secondary to immunosuppression, hypertension, glucosuria and 
metabolic abnormalities3,29.  Furthermore , there is evidence that ACTH may 
contribute to the enlargement of cardiac rhabdomyoma in TSC patients30,31.  ACTH 
treatment is therefore generally short -term (~2  weeks followed by [CONTACT_13217]) and close 
monitoring is required in TSC patients with cardiac rhabdomyoma .  Relapse rates 
following effective ACTH treatment range from 15 –60%5. 
Vigabatrin (VGB) is a newer AED and was approved by [CONTACT_13632] 2009 (as Sabril®) 
to treat IS in children aged 1 month to 2 years3.  VGB is a structural analog of 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA; the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain ) that 
irreversibly inhibits GABA -transamin ase and thereby [CONTACT_313000]32.  The initial, prospective RCT  compared VGB (100–150 mg/kg/day) with 
ACTH (10 IU/day) in 42 patients with IS33.  After 20  days ’ treatment, 11 of 
23 patients (48%) treated with VGB were spasm -free compared with 14  of 19 patients

(74%) treated with ACTH.  Resolution of hypsarrhythmia occurred in 36% of the 
responders to VGB, compared with 78% of the responders to ACTH.  Of note, VGB was more effective than ACTH as treatment for cerebral  malformations and TSC.  In 
a separate RCT,  which compared VGB (150 mg/kg/day ; n= 11) with the oral steroid 
hydrocortisone (15 mg/kg/day ; n= 11) for the treatment of IS specifically due to TSC, 
100% of patients taking VGB were spasm- free after 1  month’s treatment compared 
with 45% taking hydrocortisone
34.  Furthermore, of the non-responders who received 
hydrocortisone, all became spasm-free on switching to VGB therapy.  In contrast, a 
later placebo -controlled trial of VGB as first-line treatment of IS did not include any 
patients with TSC35.  After 5  days’ treatment, 7  of 20 patients (35%) who received 
VGB (50 –150 mg/kg/day) were spasm -free compared with 2  of 20 patients (10%) 
who received placebo.  Resolution of hypsarrhythmia occurred in 71% of the 
responders to VGB compared with 50% of the responders to placebo.  Following a subsequent open- label phase, 15  patients (42% of those who entered the phase) were 
spasm -free with VGB monotherapy after 6  months’ treatment, [ADDRESS_385292] comparing VGB (100 –150 mg/kg/day; 
n=52) with tetracosactide (0.50–0.75 mg [40 –60 IU] every 2  days; n= 25) or 
high-dose prednisolone (40–60 mg/day; n= 30) for the treatment of IS
22.  After 
2 weeks’ treatment, 54% of patients who received VGB were spasm -free compared 
with 73% of patients who received either tetracosactide or prednisolone.  In those for whom it was measured, resolution of hypsarrhythmia occurred in 71% of the responders to VGB compared with 81% of the responders to hormonal treatment. 
A separate RCT of VGB (18 –148 mg/kg/day; n= 142) included 25 patients diagnosed 
with TSC
36.  Of these patients, 52% were both spasm - and hypsarrhythmia- free after 
2 weeks’ treatment compared with 16% of patients with other etiologies.  
Furthermore, after 71  days’ treatment , 92% of patients with TSC who began VGB 
therapy were spasm -free compared with 56% of patients with other etiologies, 
although whether these patients received additional treatments during this time is 
unclear.   Following recruitment of more patients into the trial and use of 
intent- to-treat analysis, however, only 21% of patients with  TSC could be classed as 
primary responders after 2  weeks’ treatment compared with 9% of patients with other 
etiologies37.  Although VGB is generally well tolerated, long -term treatment with 
VGB is associated with irreversible peripheral visual field defects (VFD), the risk of 
which increases with increasing dose and cumulative exposure32.  The prevalence of 
VGB -associated VFD in children with refractory complex partial seizures is 
approximately 15%; however, a recent study found that 34% of patients who received

reported in the [ADDRESS_385293] concluded that VGB is possibly effective in the short- term 
control of IS, especially in the case of TSC, although treatment with ACTH/oral 
steroids may result in a better long -term neurodevelopmental outcome than treatment 
with VGB in children with IS due to unknown etiologies24,28.  Other agents used in 
the treatment of IS include valproic acid, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), nitrazepam, zonisamide, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], sulthiame, levetiracetam , lamotrigine, intravenous 
immunoglobulin, thyrotropin- releasing hormone, and ketogenic die t

there is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_312886].  
3.[ADDRESS_385294] (IMP), GWP42003-P, is formulated from extracts prepared from Cannabis sativa L. plants that have a defined chemical profile 
and contain consistent levels of CBD as the principal phytocannabinoid.  Extracts from these plants are processed to yield purified ( ≥ 98%) CBD that typi[INVESTIGATOR_312887] 0.15% (w/w) Δ
9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).  The purified CBD is 
subsequently dissolved in excipi[INVESTIGATOR_31628]. 
The pharmacological effects of phytocannabinoids are thought to be mediated 
primarily via their interaction with the endocannabinoid system, which comprises 
cannabinoid receptors, endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids), and enzymes for endocannabinoid synthesis and degradation.  To date, [ADDRESS_385295] been identified, designated CB
1 receptor and CB 2 receptor.  
CBD does not bind to either of these receptors with any great affinity but does modulate the metabolizing enzymes of the endocannabinoid system.  CBD also affects conduction of ion channels and acts on other G-protein-coupled receptors such 
as the transient receptor potential channel TRPV1
42 and the orphan receptor GPR5543.  
Importantly, CBD lacks the psychoactivity associated with THC.  Further to this, 
CBD has demonstrated anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, neuroprotective, 
antioxidant and anti- inflammatory activity44.  Data concerning adverse events (AEs) 
of CBD in humans are  limited ; however, in the small number of placebo-controlled 
trials published to date investigating the anticonvulsant effects of CBD, few side

EudraCT Number: 2015- 004904- [ADDRESS_385296] been reported  after 4 –12 months of 200–300 mg/day CBD44.  A recent 
abstract at the American Epi[INVESTIGATOR_312888]  2015 Annual Meeting described the safety 
profile of GWP42003-P (up to 25 mg/kg/day)  in [ADDRESS_385297] common AEs  (i.e., reported in 
≥ 10% of patients) were somnolence ( 23%) , diarrhea ( 23%), fatigue (17%), decreased 
appetite ( 17%), convulsions (17%), and vomiting (10%).  Dropouts due to AEs were 
4%. 
3.3 Rationale  
The approved pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_312889], and  a significant proportion of patients develop 
medically -intractable epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]46.  Consequently, there is a clear need for new, safe 
and efficacious pharmaceutical treatments for infantile spasms .  Given the limitations 
of current AEDs, it has been suggested that CBD should be tested for anticonvulsive 
efficacy in RCTs , especially in infantile epi[INVESTIGATOR_122245]44.  Although there are no 
completed RCTs  to date investigating the efficacy of CBD for the treatment of IS , a 
recent parent survey has reported that 92% of children with IS and/or LGS  
experienced a reduction in seizures while taking CBD -enriched cannabis, with 13% 
becoming seizure- free47.  The CBD -enriched cannabis was well -tolerated and 
children often experienced improved sleep, increased alertness, and better mood.  
Moreover, in a recent open -label expanded access program  (EAP) of GWP42003- P 
(up to 50 mg/kg/day) in 9 patients with a diagnosis of infantile or epi[INVESTIGATOR_59666]  
(aged 2 -16 years) , 67% of patients  had achieved a > 50% reduction in seizures after 
2 weeks’  treatment , with 33% becoming seizure- free48.   Improvements in alertness, 
verbal capacity/communications, and cognitive availabilities  were also reported .  Side 
effects were reported  in 90% of patients, yet were alleviated  by [CONTACT_313001].  In the recently completed GWEP1332 
trial in Dravet syndr ome, the primary efficacy endpoint was a comparison between 
GWP42 003-P and placebo measuring the median percentage change in the monthly 
frequency of co nvulsive seizures during the 14-week treatment period compared with 
the 4 -week baseline observation period.  In this study, preliminary data show ed 
patients taking GWP42003-P achieved a median reduction in monthly convulsive 
seizures of 39% compared with a reduction on placebo of 13%, which was 
statistically significant (p=0.01).   The trial randomized 120 patients into 2 arms, 
GWP42003-P 20 mg/kg/day (n=61) and place bo (n=59).  GWP42003-P or placebo 
was added to current AED treatment regimens .  On average, patients were taking 
approximately 3  AEDs, having previously tried and failed an average of more than 4

other AEDs.  The average age of trial participants was 10 yea rs and 30% of patients 
were less than [ADDRESS_385298] treatment regimens with current ly approved  IS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_312890]49. For example,  VGB is initially given at a dose 
of 50 mg/kg/day and can be titrated by 25–50 mg/kg/day increments every 3  days to a 
maximum dose of 150 mg/kg/day50; both of these doses are approximately 3 times the 
recommended initial and maximal dose of VGB in adults .  Moreover, t reatment with 
ACTH, which is injected intramuscularly, be gins at the maintenance dose 
immediately  (150 IU/m2/day recommended )51.  Consequently , due to the urgency 
required in achieving efficacious doses to treat this population, rapid titration to a 
maximal safe and tolerable maintenance dose is proposed in this trial in infants with 
IS.  The titration regimen proposed for use on this trial w as discussed, and agreed , 
with consultants.  Due t o the rapid titration of the IMP, all patients in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312891] t during the 4-day titration period.  Following independent data safety 
monitoring committee (DSMC)  review , adjustment of doses and dose regimens may  
occur during the trial, as well as plans for the dose titration  during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338]. 
The DSMC s of the GW studies in Dravet syndrome patients (GWEP1332, 
GWEP1424) and LGS patients (GWEP1414, GWEP1423) recommended a target of 
20 mg/kg/day as a safe and tolerable dose during a 14- week treatment period .  The 
lower age limit in these studies is  2 years of age.   Three of the 4 studies are now 
complete ; preliminary data from the GWEP1332 trial show GWP42003-P was 
gene rally well tolerated .  The most common AEs (occurring  in greater than 10%  of 
GWP42003-P- treated patients  [n=61]) were: somnolence, diarrhea, decreased 
appetite, fatigue, pyrexia, vomiting, lethargy, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_312892].  Of tho se patients on GWP42003-P for whom an AE was reported, 84% 
of these AEs were mild or moderate.   
Data on the safety of GWP42003- P is also emerging from the physician -initiated EAP  
being conducted in the US as well as other compassionate use worldwide.  This 
program has been running since January [ADDRESS_385299] data cut (September 2015) shows 
that the mean maximum exposure achieved in this patient population of refractory

> 20 and ≤  30 mg/kg/day CBD and 18% taking > 30 and ≤  50 mg/kg/day CBD .  In 
healthy adults administered doses of up to 1500 mg GWP42003- P twice daily for

6 consecutive days with a single morning dose on Day 7, treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) reported in 95.8% of all subjects were of mild or moderate severity. The twice daily dose of 1500 mg equates to 40  mg/kg/day in a 75 kg adult.  In 
addition, 75.0% of subjects administered single doses of up to 6000 mg CBD 
(equivalent to 80 mg/kg in a 75  kg adult) reported TEAEs, all of mild or moderate 
severity.  When [ADDRESS_385300], a 4.85-fold increase in the maximum measured plasma concentration  
and a 4.20- fold increase in  exposure (measured as area under the concentration -time 
curve calculated to the last observable concentration at time t) for CBD were 
observed.  The extent of the food effect was also reflected in CBD metabolite exposure.  The exposure increase coincided with a higher incidence, but no increased 
severity, of TEAEs in the fed compared to the fasted group
52. 
In view of the higher metabolic rate of children aged up to 2 years , it has been 
recommended by [CONTACT_313002] 30–40% higher 
than that used for patients  [ADDRESS_385301] and EAP  data detailed above, a target  dose of 40 mg/kg/day is

7 PATIENT ENROLL MENT 
Before patient s may be entered into the trial, GW requires a copy of the relevant site ’s 
institutional review board  (IRB) or  independent ethics committee  (IEC) written 
approval of the protocol, informed consent form (ICF) , and other patient  information 
material .  Patient s will be considered enrolled in the trial from the time written 
informed consent is provided.  The  patient’s parent(s)/legal representative  must 
personally sign and date the ICF prior to any procedures being performed (refer to 
Section  9.2.1 and Section  15.2).  
7.1 Treatment Assignment  
At the start of Visit 1, patients will be allocated a unique patient  number using an 
IVRS /IWRS .  After confirmation of eligibility at Visit 2, patient s will be assigned  
GWP42003- P (pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] ) or randomly allocated to GWP42003-P or matching 
placebo (pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] ) using the IVRS /IWRS .  G-Pharm  or delegated contractors will 
provide all IMP in a packed and labeled state and the IVRS /IWRS  will identify the 
pack number to be dispensed to the patient  at each relevant visit, according to the 
treatment assigned in the randomization schedule. 
7.2 Randomization 
For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338], the allocation of IMP to treatment number will be done 
according to a randomization schedule produced by [CONTACT_55467].  The 
randomization schedule will be held centrally by [CONTACT_313012].  For access to blinded treatment assignment, see  Section  8.5.

regarding IMP formulations, see  Section  5. 
8.1.1  Dose Administration 
The IMP will be administered orally by [CONTACT_102]’s  caregiver twice each day 
(morning and evening), maintaining consistency with  regard to feeds/meals  and other 
concomitant medications , using the syringe(s) provided.  Dosing via a 
gastric/nasogastric tube (as required) may be considered following approval by [CONTACT_312994] ; details of dose admini stration via the gastric/nasogastric tube 
will be provided in a separate pharmacy manual .  The IMP may be taken with other 
concomitant medications, as directed by [CONTACT_093].   In the event that the IMP is 
poorly tolerated, dosing may be changed to 3 times daily  (while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_312904]) following approval by [CONTACT_312994].   The 
recommended dosing intervals are:  
• 12-hourly (8-hourly minimum) for twice daily dosing. 
• 6-hourly (minimum) for 3 times daily dosing.  
8.1.2  Dose Escalati on and Dose Adjustments  
All patients will be weighed during each clinic visit  whe re IMP is dispensed (i.e., no 
physical exam performed at Visit 3 [ Day 4 ] or Visit 5 [ Day 19 ]).  The volumes of 
IMP solution to be taken each day during the titration period s, and for the remainder 
of each  phase of the trial , will be calculated and provided to the patient’s caregiver.  If 
an unacceptable AE develops at any time during the titration periods, dosing should initially be amended or suspended, at the investigator’s discretion, until the event has 
resolved or is well tolerated.  During the maintenance periods, patients should continue on a stable dosing regimen at the target dose.  However, if the patient is not able to tolerate the target dose,  the investigator may c onsider temporarily or 
permanently reducing the dose or dosage for the remainder of the maintenance period. 
Eligible patients will be assigned GWP42003-P (pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731]) or randomly allocated to 
GWP42003-P or matching placebo  (pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338]) and will titrate  the IMP over

Following the end of treatment, all patients will commence a taper period  (tapering  
10% per  day for 10  days ).  Patients who withdraw early should also begin the taper 
period following the withdrawal visit (unless continued dosing is not possible due to 
an AE).  Patients who discontinue IMP during the OLE phase should also begin the 
taper period following the investigator’s decision to discontinue.  The IVRS/IWRS 
will generate the patient’s daily IMP dosing volumes for the 10 -day taper period. 
8.2 Concomitant Therapy  
All non- pharmacological interventions for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (including ketogenic diet and any 
neurostimulation devices for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) must have been stable for at least [ADDRESS_385315] remain stable  throughout the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312910].  During the screening period, patients should continue to take their current IS therapy at a stable dose.  After starting treatment, and during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312911], every effort should be made to keep the patient ’s current IS therapy  stable ; 
current therapy may  be tapered  or stopped, in response to AEs, at the discretion of the 
investigator.   Increases in the dose of existing concomitant AEDs or commencement  
of new AEDs are not allowed during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312912], and should the investigator  deem that an increase in concomitant AED or new AE D be needed, the 
subject may need to be withdrawn from the trial (see Section  10).  During the OLE, in 
response to AEs  or if there are symptoms of toxicity due to a suspected drug -drug 
interaction,  the investigator may decrease the dose of GWP42003-P or other 
concomitant AEDs following  discussion with the GW medical monitor.  Any r equest 
for an increase in concomitant AED dose, or addition of a new AED in the OLE must be discussed with the GW medical monitor prior to implementing, and will be based on confirmation of benefit over risk of continued treatment with or discontinuation of 
GWP4 2003- P.  It should be noted that there is the potential for drug- drug interactions 
with strong inhibitors/in ducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C19; if alternatives cannot be 
found these should be co- administered with caution and  monitoring as cli nically 
indicated .  Monitoring of concomitant AEDs may be requested by [CONTACT_313013] .  Any AED monitoring should be documented in the CRF.  
Further information on drug interactions can be found in the Investigator Brochure 
(IB)
53. 
As the  risk of hepatotoxicity with valproate is high in the trial population, 
investigators should pay particular attention to liver enzyme levels in patients who are 
taking valproate concomitantly . 
The use of rescue medication is allowed if clinically indicated .  Any medication, other 
than the IMP, taken during the trial must be recorded on the case report form  (CRF).

8.3 Prohibited Therapy During Trial  Period  
The following medications are prohibited both prior to and during the trial, as stated 
below.  However, any patients taking these medications after starting treatment on the trial should not be withdrawn from the trial unless there are safety concerns .  If 
applicable, the possible effects of these medications on the trial endpoints will be 
considered during the assessment of the evaluable period (see  Section  13.6.1).  
• Any new non- pharmacological interventions for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (including ketogenic 
diet and any neurostimulation devices for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) or changes in regimen 
during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312913] (and within the 2 weeks  prior to

• Recreational or medicinal cannabis, or synthetic cannabinoid- based 
medications  (and wit hin the 1 month prior to the screening visit). 
• Any other IMP taken as part of a clinical trial  (and within a minimum of

The pa tient’s  caregiver  will record IMP intake on each treatment day in the paper 
diary.   Caregivers  should return all IMP (used and unused) at each of V isits 4, 6–12, 
and the end of taper period visit, if applicable.  The diary -reported  dosing information 
will be checked and any discrepancies discussed with the patient’s caregiver  at the 
time of the visit and documented accordingly within the patient ’s source documents.  
Records of IMP accountability will be maintained according to  Section  5.3.4.

responsible for ensuring that information on how to access the IVRS /IWRS  for an 
individual patient  is available to the relevant staff in case of an emergency and 
unblinding is required .  A patient ’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded 
when knowledge of the treatment is essent ial to make a decision on the medical 
management of the patient.  Unblinding for any other reason will be considered a 
protocol deviation.

All causally  related AEs that result in a patient’s premature termination from the trial 
or are present at the end of the trial should be followed up until a satisfactory 
resolution occurs; that is, until the AE resolves or is considered clinically 
insignificant, or until the investigator is satisfied that the AE is not related to IMP and 
needs no further investigation.

9.2 Trial  Procedure Listing 
9.2.1  Informed Consent  
The parent(s)/legal representative of the patient  must personally sign and date the 
IRB/IEC -approved ICF before any trial- specific  procedures are performed or any 
patient -related data is recorded for the trial .  GW requires a physician to be present for 
consent and to sign the consent form also .  The original signed ICF should be retained 
and a copy provided to the patient ’s parent(s)/legal representative.  The patient ’s 
parent(s)/legal representatives will be given the option of being informed about the 
summary outcome and results of the trial as part of the ICF.  For further details, see Section  15.2. 
9.2.2  Interactive Voice Response System/Interactive Web Response 
System  
The IVRS/IWRS will be used to assign patients to treatment groups, manage IMP 
supply, and to provide treatment allocation information in the event of patient unblinding (pi[INVESTIGATOR_312861]). 
A member of the trial team must contact [CONTACT_21926]/IWRS at each clinic visit in order 
to: 
• Obtain a patien t number (Visit  1). 
• Assign GWP42003-P (pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] ) or r andomize a patient (pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338]) 
(Visit 2).  
• Obtain dispensing information (Visits 2, 4, 6–11, and for the taper period, if 
necessary ). 
• Provide IMP discontinuation/IMP restart/ completion/taper/premature 
termination information.  
Training will be given to all sites prior to the start of the trial.  
9.2.3  Demographics  
The following information will be obtained for each patient (as allowed per local 
regulations): 
• Date of birth. 
• Sex. 
• Race. 
• Date of  onset of IS.

• Gestation al age at birth . 
• Birthweight. 
9.2.4  Medical History  
The following medical history will be obtained for each patient: 
• Prior and current seizures /spasms. 
• Prior AEDs/steroids . 
• Prior IS treatment details  (all approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_312844]’s parent(s)/legal representative before the patient is considered for the 
trial; discussions regarding treatment options must be documented). 
• Presence of abnormal EEG patterns that are consistent with IS, including hypsarrhythmia . 
• Neuroimaging history.  
• Unequivocally normal development at onset of IS . 
• Etiologic classification of IS:  
• idiopathic (genetic). 
• symptomatic (structural / metabolic).  
• cryptogenic (unknown). 
In addition, any relevant, significant medical history  will be obtained, and is defined 
as any condition or disease that: 
• May affect the condition under study. 
• Is ongoing on entry into the trial. 
9.2.5  Concomitant Medication 
Details of all current and prior medication , including AEDs /steroids,  will be obtained.  
Any changes in concomitant medication during the trial must be recorded on the CRF 
at trial visits .  Refer to  Section  8.2 and Section  8.3 for further information.  
9.2.6  Physical Examination  
Physical examinations will include length  (height ), body weight, and head 
circumference measurements.

9.2.7  Vital Signs  
Vital sign s measurements  (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body 
temperature and respir atory rate), taken in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_312928] 5 minutes , will 
be completed alongside the physical examination .  The methods /procedures  employed 
for vital sign s measurements  must be consistent throughout the trial , where possible.  
Any deviation in methods used must be reported to the study monitor. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_385323] review the ECG  immediately  (annotated, signed and dated) and any abnormal 
findings considered to indicate significant medical history or AEs must be recorded 
appropriately on the CRF.  Additional ECG measurements can be taken at any time 
during the trial , if clinically indicated.  
9.2.9  Video- electro encephalography  
Prolonged video -EEG monitoring (minimum 8  hours in duration, extendable to 
24 hours ) will be performed to document clinical spasms and EEG patterns consistent 
with IS .  At least [ADDRESS_385324] begin treatment within 7 days of their  video- EEG screening assessment.  
In addition to being read at the trial site , all video -EEG recordings will be  centrally 
read retrospectively  (see APPENDIX 2 for further det ails regarding the central 
reader) .  The assessment by [CONTACT_313024]- EEG assessment 
screening  will be considered final.  Any video-EEG findings considered to represent 
an AE  must be documented on the CRF .   
9.2.10  Clinical Laboratory Sampling  
Due to the nature of the disease being studied, and the need for prompt treatment of patients, it will be necessary to use local laboratories for the clinical laboratory aspects of the trial.  
Urine samples (provided urine can be obtained) will be analyzed  at the trial site by 
[CONTACT_2363] a dipstick with any relevant findings being sent for further urinalysis at a local  
laboratory (urinalysis, microscopy, culture and sensitivity, as applicable).

Blood samples may be taken from patients  involved in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338], and 
progressing to the OLE from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338], for the determination of CBD and its 
metabolites  (6-OH-CBD, 7- COOH- CBD , and 7- OH-CBD ) to provide an 
understanding of the PK  of CBD.  In addition, an exploration of the relationship 
between plasma levels of CBD with safety and efficacy may be performed.   In this 
trial, a sparse sampling approach will be employed to minimize  the impact on patients  
in terms of potential discomfo rt and to keep the blood volume taken as low as 
practicable.  Suggested sampling times are as follows: 
• Day 1: between 1 and 12 hours after the day’s first dose of IMP . 
• Day 15: prior to the day’s first dose of IMP and around 2 hours postdose. 
• Day 19: between 4 and 12 hours after the day’s first dose of IMP  (only for 
patients in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312929]). 
These sampling times should be considered optimal; however, since the data will be 
fitted to a population PK  model developed from other clinical trials, the i nvestigator 
should use their discretion regarding sampling time to minimize  distress/discomfort to 
the patient .  IMP d osing time and blood sampling time should be recorded accurately.  
The dosing time of any concomitant AEDs and timing of feeds/meals  should also be

10 WITHDRAWAL  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsink i56, the International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Tripartite  Guideline for GCP Topic E6(R1)57, the F DA 
regulations relating to GCP  and clinical trials58,59,60, the EU  Clinical Trials 
Directive61, the EU GCP  Directive62 and/or other applicable regulations, a patient  has 
the right to withdraw from the trial at any time and for any reason , with no obligation 
to provide a reason, and without prejudice to his or her future medical care by [CONTACT_31690].  
The patient  must be withdrawn from the trial if any of the following apply:  
• Any issue with eligibility criteria that is considered to potentially compromise the safety of the patient . 
• Administrative decision by [CONTACT_093], GW, or a regulatory authority. 
• Protocol deviation that is considered to compromise potentially the safety of the patient . 
• Withdrawal of the patient’s parent(s)/legal representative consent. 
• QTcB of 500 msec or greater on ECG, or a shift from baseline QTcB of 60 msec or greater.  
Note: Prior to withdrawal for the QTcB shifts noted above, the investigator should repeat the ECG three times and contact [CONTACT_312994].  If 
the above QTcB criteria are confirmed, the patient must be withdrawn from 
the trial.   
• Lost to follow-up. 
• ALT or AST  > 3 ×  ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia 
(> 5%).  
• ALT or AST  > 8 ×  ULN.  
• ALT or AST  > 5 ×  ULN for more than 2 weeks.  
• ALT or AST  > 3 ×  ULN and (TBL  > 2 ×  ULN or  INR > 1.5). 
Note:  Prior to withdrawal for the transaminase elevations noted above, the 
Investigator may choose to confirm the transaminase elevations by [CONTACT_312992] 24 to 48 hours: ALT, AST, TBL, INR, % eosinophils, 
gamma glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase.  Should the above

Study Code : GWEP15100  
EudraCT Number: 2015- 004904- [ADDRESS_385330] be withdrawn from 
the trial.  
Patients  may also be withdrawn from the trial for any of the following: 
• Any other issue with eligibility criteria (non -safety related) . 
• Any requirement to increase the dose of concomitant AED(s) or to add in new AED(s)  during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312855].  
• If a patient is not showing evidence of benefit during the OLE phase  (the 
option of withdrawing from the trial will be discussed with the caregiver  at 
each visit ). 
• Patient/caregiver  non- compliance.  
• AE (including clinically significant laboratory result)  which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046] , would compromise the continued safe participation of the 
patient  in the trial. 
Should a patient’s parent(s)/legal representative request or decide to withdraw the patient from the trial, all efforts must be made to complete and report the observations 
as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal .  Patients who are withdrawn 
should have their dose of IMP tapered gradually (10% each day) over a period of 
10 days, beginning at the time the decision is made to discontinue.  In some cases, tapering the dose of IMP may be inadvisable (e.g., continued dosing is not possible 
due to an AE).  The decision on whether or not to taper IMP will be left to the 
investigator’s clinical judgment.  All assessments required at Visit 4 (end of pi[INVESTIGATOR_312855] /withdrawal) or Visit 12 (end of OLE treatment /withdrawal) , as 
appropriate, should be conducted if possible.  If the tapered dose is administered, 
caregivers  should continue to complete the paper diary and return for the end of taper 
period visit, if possible.  For patients who begin to taper IMP but are subsequently 
withdrawn, the end of taper period visit assessments (including ECG and clinical laboratory sampling) should be conducted, if possible; this visit should occur on the 
final day of dosing or as soon as possible after this date.  Patients  who are withdrawn 
due to an AE should be followed up according to Section  12.6.  All information 
should be reported on t he applicable CRF pages (refer to  Section  9.2).  Wherever 
possible, a safety  follow-up visit should take place [ADDRESS_385331] dose of IMP 
(refer to  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) .  If the parent(s)/legal representative of withdrawing patients  
decline to give a reason for withdrawal of consent, the investigator  must respect the se 
wishes.

12 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
12.1 Definitions  
12.1.1  Adverse Event  
For the purposes of this trial an AE is defined as:  
Any new unfavorable/unintended signs/symptoms (including abnormal laboratory 
findings when relevant ), or diagnosis or worsening of a pre -existing condition , which  
occurs  following screening (Visit 1) and at any point up to the post- treatment, safety 
follow-up visit, which may or may not be considered to be related to the IMP.  Any 
event that is the result of a trial procedure must be record ed as an AE. 
Surgical /Investigational procedures are not AEs .  The medical reason for the 
procedure is the AE .  Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312934] -trial existing conditions or 
elective procedures are not  AEs .  The exception may be if the patient  has an AE 
during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312935] a SAE ( refer to  Section  12.2 ). 
If reporting a fatal event , the SAE term should be the underlying cause of the death 
(e.g., disease or medical condition leading to death). 
12.1.[ADDRESS_385333] the medicine is 
developed (e.g., change in dose, population, monitoring need, consent forms).  This is 
particularly true for events that threaten life or function .  Such SAEs will be reported 
promptly to regulatory authorit ies, applicable IRBs/IECs  and investigators (expedited 
reporting) by [CONTACT_31694].  
An AE must only be classed as serious, i.e. , a SAE, when the event falls into one of 
the following criteria : 
• Results in death . 
• Is life -threatening*. 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
Confidential  Page 87 of 143

EudraCT Number: 2015- 004904- 50 
Protocol V3 20Sep16  
 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Is medically significant**. 
* The term “life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event ; it does not refer to an event 
which , hypothetically , might have caused death if it were more severe.  
** Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations.  Important medical events may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312936].  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
The sponsor consider s all convulsive and non-convulsive status epi[INVESTIGATOR_312937]  
12.[ADDRESS_385334] be reported directly to  the GW Pharmacovigilance Department 
(PVD) within [ADDRESS_385335] be recorded in the SAE r eport forms provided in the site  files and 
faxed to the GW  PVD (see APPENDIX 2 ).  Additional information received for a 
case ( follow-up or corrections to the original case) need to be detailed on a new SAE 
report form , signed/dated and  faxed to the GW PVD  and the AE  section of the CRF 
must be updated. 
Any other problem discovered after the safety follow -up visit which is deemed to be 
an unexpected safety issue and is likely to have an impact on patient s who have taken 
part in the trial must be treated  as an SAE and repor ted to the GW PVD.  Such 
post- trial SAEs do not need to be recorded on the patient ’s CRF if edit ing rights to the 
CRF have been removed due to final trial data lock .  GW PVD may request safety

Study Code : GWEP15100  
EudraCT Number: 2015- 004904- [ADDRESS_385336] be reported as such.  The expression 
“reasonable causal relationship”  is meant to convey in general that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following question which must be answered by [CONTACT_313026]: 
“In your opi[INVESTIGATOR_31647] a plausible relationship to the IMP ?” The  answer is either 
“yes”  or “no”.  
Events that start before the first dose of IMP (pre-treatment) should be considered as 
not causally related .  Where a pre- treatment event worsens in severity following the 
first dose of IMP , a new event record should be entered into the CRF. 
Considering the explanation given above, investigators are strongly encouraged to express their opi[INVESTIGATOR_31648].  For individual patient s, 
the investigator  is usually in the best position to assess the underlying suspected cause 
of an  AE.  For all AEs and especially  SAEs, it is important that the investigator  assess 
not only the possible role of the IMP but also other potential contributing factors .  
Factors for consideration  of the underlying cause may include: 
• Medical  and disease history. 
• Lack of efficacy/worsening of treated condition. 
• Concomitant or previous treatment. 
• Withdrawal of IMP. 
• Protocol- related procedure. 
12.5 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events 
All AEs  (including SAEs) occurring during the trial  will be reported on the running 
logs in  the AE section of the CRF .  This inc ludes all events from the time following

screening (Visit  1) up to and including the post- treatment follow-up visit, whether or 
not attributed to IMP and observed by [CONTACT_31698] . 
The following information will need to be provided for all AEs: 
A) Adverse Event ( Diagnosis or S yndrome if K nown, or S igns and S ymptoms)  
Where the investigator cannot determine a diagnosis, signs or symptoms should be 
recorded in the AE section of the CRF .  Once a diagnosis has been determined the AE 
section of CRF must be updated to reflect the diagnosis in replacement of the original symptoms .  In circumstances where only a provisional diagnosis is possible (working 
diagnosis), the CRF must be updated to reflect the provisional diagnosis in 
replacement of the original symptoms .  In some circumstances it may be relevant for 
the investigator  to includ e the symptoms alongside the diagnosis in the verbatim event 
description.  However, the diagnosis (full or provisional) should be clearly stated, e.g. , 
fever and malaise due to a respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] . 
B) Adverse Event Start D ate and Stop D ate 
The st art and stop dates of the event must be provided.  All AEs require these fields to 
be completed in full.  Partial dates or missing dates are not normally acceptable and 
significant effort must be undertaken to obtain any unknown information.  If a precise 
date is not known an estimated date should be provided instead.  When a complete 
date cannot be given , record as much information as possible (i.e., month and year or, 
in exceptional circumstances , just year) .  When the actual start date becomes known 
the CRF must be updated to replace the previously recorded date.  
C) Outcome  
The outcome of the event must be recorded accurately and classified into one for the 
following categories:  
• Recovered . 
• Recovered with sequelae . 
• Continuing. 
• Patient  died . 
D) Severity  
When describing the severity of an AE the terms mild, moderate, or severe should be 
used.  Clinical judgment should be used when determining which severity applies to 
any AE . 
Confidential  Page 90 of 143

Study Code : GWEP15100  
EudraCT Number: 2015- 004904- 50 
Protocol V3 20Sep16  
 
If the severity of an AE fluctuates day -to-day, e.g. , a headache or constipation, the 
change in severity should not be recorded each time; instead , only the worst observed 
severity should be recorded with AE  start and stop dates relating to the overall event 
duration, regardless of severity . 
A severe AE is not the same as a SAE .  For ex ample, a patient  may have severe 
vomiting but the event does not result in any of the SAE criteria above.  Therefore , it 
should not be classed as serious. 
E) Causality  
See Section  12.4 above. 
F) Action Taken with Trial  Medication  
This question refers to the action taken with the IMP due to an AE.  The action with 
the IMP  must be classed as:  
• None. 
• Dose reduced  temporarily . 
• Dose reduced . 
• Trial  medication interrupted . 
• Trial  medication stopped. 
12.6 Follow -up Procedures for Adverse Events  
The investigator may be asked to provide follow-up information to the GW  PVD for 
any AEs reported  or during the investigation of potential safety issues.  Such requests 
for additional safety information may occur after the safety follow -up visit (i.e., after 
the trial). 
AEs considered related to the IMP by [CONTACT_313027]. It will be left to the investigator ’s clinical judgment whether or not an AE is of 
sufficient severity to require the patient ’s removal from treatment.  A patient ’s 
parent(s)/legal representative  may also voluntarily withdraw  the patient  from 
treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable AE .  Further details of 
withdrawal are presented in  Section  10.  If either of these occurs, the patient  must 
undergo an end of treatment assessment and be given appropriate care under medical 
supervision until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable .  If a safety concern 
is identified following withdrawal of a patient , GW may contact [CONTACT_313028]-up information.

12.7 Potential Cases of Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
All investigational site s are required to submit to the GW PVD the laboratory result s 
for any patient  after starting treatment that meet s the criteria for the selected 
laboratory parameters as follows:  
• ALT  or AST  > 3 ×  ULN  with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia 
(> 5%).  
• ALT or AST  > 8 ×  ULN.  
• ALT or AST  > 5 ×  ULN for more than 2 weeks.  
• ALT or AST  > 3 ×  ULN  and (TBL > 2 ×  ULN or  INR > 1.5). 
These reports must be sent to the GW PVD using the fax number for SAE reporting 
(see APPENDIX  2) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the results.  In addition, 
please send a copy of the patient ’s baseline laboratory results with all reports to the 
GW PVD.  
Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT concurrent with abnormal elevations in TBL that meet the criteria outlined above are considered potential cases of drug -induced 
liver injury and will be considered as protocol-defined criteria for withdrawal and 
important medical events .  The investigator will arrange for the patient  to return to the 
investigational site  as soon as possible (within 24 to 48 hours of notice of abnormal 
results) for repeat assessment  of ALT, AST, TBL, alkaline phosphatase and 
gamma -glutamyl transferase levels, detailed h istory and physical examination .  
Patient s should be followed in this way until all abnormalities have normalized  (in the 
investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) or returned to the baseline state, however, if the above 
transaminase elevation criteria are confirmed by [CONTACT_313029] -up laboratory 
tests, the patient must be withdrawn from the trial. 
Elevations in ALT or AST > 3 × ULN or  TBL  > 2 × UL N alone are not considered 
potential cases of drug -induced liver injury, but will be followed as detailed above, 
within 72 hours’ notice of abnormal results.   
12.8 Notification of Safety Information to Investigator s, Regulatory 
Authorities , and IRBs /IECs  
In accordance with the EU Clinical Trials Directive
61, relevant parts of the FDA Code 
of Federal Regulations63, and any national regulations, GW will inform investigator s, 
regulatory authorit ies and relevant IRBs/IECs  of all relevant safety information .  This

will include the reporting of relevant SAEs and all suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) . 
This information will be provided through 3 sources: 
1. IB53: a compi[INVESTIGATOR_312938]- clinical safety data available on the 
IMP that is relevant to the trial.  The IB is updated annually. 
2. Development core safety information : this document forms the s afety s ection  
of the IB53, or is updated as an addendum to the IB53.  This document is 
revised if necessary , when new important safety information becomes 
available ( potentially  up to a few times a year) . 
3. Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences ( CIOMS ) reports: 
these reports are issued every time a S[LOCATION_003]R is reported to GW .  They provide 
information on individual case reports and are sent to all the regulatory authorit ies, the relevant  central IRBs/IEC s which have approved the trial and 
investigator s.  As required , the investigator  should notify their regional 
IRBs/IECs  of SAEs or  S[LOCATION_003]Rs  occurring at their site  and other AE  reports, 
i.e., CIOMS reports and any additional safety document ation received from 
GW, in accordance with local procedures.  
In the US, investigator s are normally required to report promptly to their IRBs all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to patient s, or others, including AEs that 
should be considered unanticipated problems.  Based on current FDA guidance
58 the 
following clarification is provided in determining what constitutes an unanticipated problem: 
In general, an AE observed during the conduct of a trial should be considered an 
unanticipated problem involving risk to patient s and reported to the IRB, only  if it 
were unexpected, serious, and would have implications for the conduct of the trial 
(e.g., requiring a significant, and usually safety- related, change in the protocol such as 
revising inclusion/exclusion criteria or including a new monitoring requirement, 
informed consent, or IB) .  An individual AE occurrence ordinarily  does not meet 
these criteria because, as an isolated event, its implications for the trial cannot be 
understood. 
The FDA guidance
63 states that, accordingly, to satisfy the investigator ’s obligation to 
notify the IRB of unanticipated problems, any investigators participating in a multisite  
trial may rely on the sponsor’s assessment and provide to the IRB a report of the 
unanticipated problem prepared by [CONTACT_456].

GW will inform investigator s, regulatory authorit ies and relevant IRBs/IECs  of any 
safety issues or case reports that are considered  to be unanticipated and provide such 
reports as mentioned above.  It should be noted that a single S[LOCATION_003]R report notified to 
investigator s in the trial does not necessarily constitute an unanticipated problem 
unless identified by [CONTACT_313030].  
As a minimum, the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_312939] .

second cohort aged between 1 and 24 months , who will all receive GWP42003- P. 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_312854] 192 patients , aged 1 –24 months, who will be 
randomized to receive 1 of 2 dose levels of GWP42003-P ( High Dose Level or Low 
Dose Level ) or matching placebo on a 1:1:1  basis (64 per treatment group).  Patients 
in the placebo group will be further split into 2 cohorts (32 patients receiving Low 
Dose Level dosing volumes and 32 patients receiving High Dose Level dosing 
volumes), but it is assumed that these 2 cohorts can be pooled for the analyses of 
efficacy.    
Assuming a 20% screen failure rate, it is expected that approximately 245 patients 
will need to be screened to achieve this target  (202 patients included in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312940]) .   
 
 
 
  
This
 is based on a 2-sided 5% significance level, based on a F isher’ s exact test . 
13.2 Interim
 Analysis  
No formal interim analysis will be conducted.  A review of safety and efficacy data will be conducted after the end of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] , and blinded data review (s) may be 
conducted to support IMP clinical development.  However, for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338], it is anticipated that the database will be locked and treatment unblinded, prior to the completion of the OLE phase. 
13.3 Analysis Sets  
Statistical analysis will be performed according to a statistical analysis plan  (SAP) .  
Details of any deviations from  the SAP  will be documented in the clinical study 
report .

There will be 3 analysis sets for this trial: 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_312941] [ADDRESS_385338] 1 dose of IMP during the OLE phase will be used 
for summaries of the safety endpoints during the OLE phase. 
Intention to Treat  (ITT)  
All patients  in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312942].  The ITT 
analysis  set is the primary analysis set for all efficacy endpoints.  
13.3.[ADDRESS_385339] ated otherwise, continuous variables will be summarized showing the 
number of non-missing values (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum.  Categorical variables will be summarized showing the number and 
percentage of patients  falling into  each category.  
13.5 Accountability and Background Characteristics  
13.5.1  Enrol lment and Disposition 
All patients  (screened, treated, entering the OLE, prematurely terminating IMP) will 
be accounted for in the enrollment and disposition summary tables.

Baseline characteristics, including demographics, medical history , and concomitant 
medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_313031].  
13.6 Endpoints and Statistical Methods

descriptive summaries for certain endpoints.  All safety endpoints for the phases of 
the trial will be summarized as detailed in Section  13.6.5 below. 
For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312918], statistical hypothesis testing will be performed on the secondary endpoints as appropriate.   
Since there is a single primary analysis endpoint  for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338], no formal 
adjustment of statistical significance for multiple testing on multiple endpoints is 
required, although such multiplicity should be allowed for when interpreting the results for secondary endpoints.  However, t here are 3 treatments, so multiple 
significance testing will occur when making comparisons between the treatments; the major comparisons of interest are those between each of the GWP42003- P dose levels 
and placebo.  To control the type I error, a step -up Hochberg's procedure will be used 
for the primary endpoint of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338].  If both of the observed p-values from 
the Low Dose Level and High Dose Level comparisons with placebo are < 0.050 in 
favor of the GWP42003-P treatment groups, then both groups would be declared 
statistically significantly better than placebo.  However, if the observed p -value i s 
≥ 0.050 for one GWP42003-P treatment group but < 0.025 in favor of the other 
GWP42003-P treatment group, then only the latter GWP42003- P treatment group will 
be declared statistically significantly better than placebo.  
13.6.1  Evaluable Period  
The start of the evaluable period (Day 1) is defined as the first day the patient  took 
IMP in the trial or the day of randomization/initial assignment of IMP if this date is unknown.  The end of the evaluable period for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312944].  The 
end of the evaluable period for the OLE phase is defined as the last day on which a 
study- related assessment was undertaken  during the OLE phase as opposed to the last 
day on which the study IMP was taken.  This is to allow data collected after  
discontinuation of the study IMP due to resolution of spasms to form part of the 
evaluable period .

2 RATIONALE 
This clinical protocol amendment 2 (will be incorporated into the protocol creating 
C
linical Protocol Version 3, Date 20 September 2016 ) a ddresses the following 
issue(s): Compliance with U.S. Regulatory Requirements 
In order to comply with requests received from the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), the protocol has been amended as follows: 
2
.1.1 Extend Age Range in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_42751]; Second Cohort 
As the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312963] 1 month to 24 months, the age range in 
c
ohort 2 of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312964] 6 months to 24 months to 1 month to 
24 months.  The inclusion criterion has been updated. 
2
.1.2 Clarification of Allowable Changes in Concomitant 
Medications 
The FDA suggested that allowing increased doses of patients ’ infantile spasm (IS) 
ther
apy may make the treatment effects of GWP42003-P difficult to interpret.  The 
following clarifications have therefore been made: 
 Dur ing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312965], every effort should be made to keep the 
pa
tient’s current IS therapy stable; current therapy may be tapered, in response 
to AEs, a
t the discretion of the investigator. 
 I ncreases in the dose of existing concomitant AEDs or commencement of new 
AEDs are not allowed during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312912]. 
 During the OLE, in response to AEs or if there are symptoms of toxicity due 
to a suspected drug-drug interaction, the investigator may adjust the dose of 
GWP42003-P or other concomitant AEDs following discussion with the GW 
medical monitor. 
 In Section 8.3, text has been added to prohibit any increases to existing AEDs 
or commencement of new AEDs during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312855].

2.1.3 Utilization of Central Video Electroencephalography Readings  
The FDA queried how the central video-electroencephalography (EEG) reader would 
be used in practice.  They stated that, for enrollment, the study should use a single 
expert central reader to adjudicate the presence of hypsarrhythmia and wanted to 
understand the process for disagreements between local and central EEG readings. In 
re
sponse to this, the following clarifications have been made within the protocol: 
 P rovided details of the Central Reader in Appendix 2.3. 
 Stated that the retrospective assessment of the video-EEGs by [CONTACT_313050]. 
2.1.4 Statistical Considerations 
To clarify how dropouts/missing data will be handled in the analyses, Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
has been updated: 
 De tails of sensitivity analyses due to missing data and handling of patients 
potentially receiving rescue medication will be fully detailed in the statistical 
analysis plan prior to unblinding. 
2.1.5 Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
The protocol has been updated to include: 
 Statement that ad hoc meetings of the Data Safety Monitoring Committee will 
take place based on new or unexpected safety signals. 
2.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
 C larification that approved IS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_312966]. 
 C larification that i f a patient has a QT interval, corrected for heart rate with 
Bazett’s formula (QTcB) of > [ADDRESS_385378] the GW medical monitor, prior to screen

c
linical protocol (which is that any patient whose parent(s)/legal representative 
has provided written informed consent to take part in the trial).  Therefore, the 
protocol wording has been updated as follows to avoid any misunderstanding : 
 A ny patient who has previously been included in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312968]. 
 C onfirmation of elevations in transaminase levels will be required prior 
to screen failure or entry into the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312855]. 
2.3 Withdrawal Criteria 
Following questions from investigators regarding the QTcB withdrawal criterion, the 
following clarification has been included: 
 I f a patient has a QTcB of 500 msec or greater on ECG, or a shift from 
ba
seline of 60 msec or greater, the ECG should be repeated 3 times.  If the 
QTc
B criteria are confirmed then the patient should be withdrawn from the 
trial. 
 C larification that any requirement to increase the dose of concomitant AED(s) 
or add in new AED(s) may result in the patient being withdrawn from the trial. 
2.[ADDRESS_385379] been made: 
 During a [LOCATION_006] site visit, the site asked whether laboratory results prior to 
screening could be taken into account to reduce the amount of blood that 
needs to be taken.  In line with this, the protocol now states that to minimize 
the volume of blood required, serum biochemistry and hematology results 
from samples analyzed up to [ADDRESS_385380]
 be analyzed at the same local laboratory that is being used for the clinical 
laboratory aspects of the trial. 
 To a llow limited rescreening of patients, a statement has been included such 
that, in exceptional circumstances, rescreening may be allowed following 
discussi
ons with the GW medical monitor. 
Study Code : GWEP15100 
EudraCT Number: 2015-004904- [ADDRESS_385381] been made to reduce unnecessary caregiver burden:

2.6 Minor Corrections and Clarifications 
The following minor corrections/clarifications have been made to the protocol: 
 Additi on of transaminases into the abbreviations list for ALT and AST since 
GW approved global abbreviations list now allows both aminotransferase and 
transaminase in reference to these enzymes. 
 Additi on of statistical analysis plan into the abbreviations list. 
 Updated information has been provided on completed GW studies, Expanded 
Access Program and Compassionate Use programs. 
 C omplete edit/reordering of the information presented within sections [IP_ADDRESS] 
through to [IP_ADDRESS] to ensure the relevant text correctly applies to each section. 
 Alig nment of wording between trial objectives, trial endpoints and  statistical 
endpoints. 
 The  list of contract research organizations, clinical and bioanalytical 
laboratories and central EEG reader has been updated with current details. 
 C larification of the days where safety checks should be made during IMP 
dosing in pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], pi[INVESTIGATOR_312970]-label extension phases. 
 R eference list has been updated to include new reference (GWEP1544 CSR) 
and updated citations for CBD Investigator Brochure (Edition 9) and US FDA

This clinical protocol amendment 1 (will be incorporated into the protocol 
creating Clinical Protocol Version 2, Date 31 May 2016) addresses the following 
issue(s): Compliance with U.S. Re gulatory Requirements 
In response to comments received from the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the protocol has been amended as follows: 
2.1.[ADDRESS_385382] this.  The trial will now comprise an initial open-label safety 
study comprising 2 cohorts of 5 patients (pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731]), followed by a phase 3 
efficacy study (pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338]).  The 1 year open-label extension (OLE) will be 
open to patients who complete either phase.   
Due to this change, the trial title, objectives, endpoints and patient numbers have 
been adjusted accordingly. 
2.1.2 Use of a Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
As the trial involves a vulnerable pediatric population, an independent data safety 
monitoring committee (DSMC) will be  used.  The DSMC will be used 
throughout the study and will consider safety of the patients, and confirm doses and dose regimens to be investigated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338].  If required, following 
DSMC review, adjustment of doses and dose regimens will also take place 
following the first cohort of 5 patients in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731]. 
2.1.3 Addition of a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_312971] 2 years of age, safety will be 
confirmed in a small group of patients in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84365] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731]) 
before proceeding to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312972].  Therefore, the trial will be 
performed as 2 separate phases (pi[INVESTIGATOR_312962]) which will be run sequentially.  
All patients in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312973]42003-P (open-label) while all 
patients in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312974]42003-P (1 of 2 
dose levels) or matching placebo in a double-blind manner.  As infants younger 
than 6 months are particularly vulnerable, all patients in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312975] 6 months of age.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_312976]: GWEP15100 
EudraCT Number: 2015-004904-[ADDRESS_385383] (IMP), all 
patients in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312977] 4-day 
titration period.  In both phases, compulsory clinic-based assessments will take 
place at the end of the titration period (i.e., Day 4) and OLE transition period (i.e., Day 19).  In addition, daily safety checks will be made during the first week 
of IMP dosing during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312978] (i.e., Days 1–7) and during the 
first week of OLE IMP dosing (i.e., Days 16–22).

evaluated for clinical response by [CONTACT_98991]- electroencephalogram (video-EEG) after 
[ADDRESS_385385] be

concomitant antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_32551] (AED) levels will be checked with clinical 
laboratory evaluation, as clinically indicated by [CONTACT_313051].  In 
addition, as the risk of hepatotoxicity w ith valproate may be high in the proposed 
patient population, the protocol provides guidance for investigators to pay 
particular attention to liver enzyme levels in patients who are taking valproate. 
2.1.8 Clarification of Cannabidiol Metabolites 
The protocol has been updated to clarify that the following metabolites of CBD 
will be assessed: 
• 6-hydroxy-cannabidiol (6-OH-CBD). 
• 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol (7-OH-CBD). 
• 7-carboxy-cannabidiol (7-COOH-CBD).

authorization. 
2.3 Clarification of Procedures Following the Investigator’s 
Decision to Discontinue GWP42003-P During the Open-
label Extension Phase 
The protocol has been updated to clarify that the investigator may consider 
discontinuing IMP during the OLE phase if the patient has become spasm-free 
and that the patient’s parent(s)/legal representative will be encouraged to allow the patient to remain in the trial to complete the remaining assessments (up to

Clinical Protocol Amendment Template V1, 24Sep15 of a licensed drug).  In addition, due to the urgency of establishing effective 
treatment in this patient population, the minimum time required before these 
patients may be considered eligible for this trial has been changed to [ADDRESS_385388] used cannabis/cannabinoids has been reduced to [ADDRESS_385389] be withdrawn only if there 
are safety concerns; patients may be wi thdrawn if the concerns are non-safety 
related. 
2.6 Revised Pharmacokinetic Blood Sampling Times 
Since safety blood samples will be taken on Day 4 and Day 19, the proposed 
pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sampling times have been revised to ensure that the 
maximum amount of blood taken will not exceed a total of [ADDRESS_385390] 
during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338]. 
2.7 Removal of Caregiver Impression of IMP Palatability 
Questionnaire 
The Caregiver Impression of IMP Palatability questionnaire has been removed 
from the trial, as minimal feedback is expected in this patient population as it will 
be difficult to determine due to the age of the patients.  
2.8 Removal of THC Testing 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) testing has been removed from the trial, to 
reduce the burden on the patient and caregiver.  Furthermore, rapid decision 
making and treatment is needed for this patient population, and this testing would 
add additional complexity while being of minimal benefit in this patient 
population.

efficacy data presented at the American Epi[INVESTIGATOR_312888] 69th Annual 
Meeting1,2. 
2.10 Patient Confidentiality 
The protocol has been updated to clarify that all video-EEG recordings will be 
kept confidential and secure, and that the patient’s anonymity must be 
maintained if data are presented. 
2.11 Minor Corrections and Clarifications 
The following minor corrections/clarifications have been made to the protocol: 
• Only patients who complete the pi[INVESTIGATOR_312981]; those who withdraw early are 
ineligible. 
• Since absorption of topi[INVESTIGATOR_312982] (mTOR) inhibitors is lower than oral formulations, only oral mTOR inhibitors may 
not be used. 
• The eligibility criterion regarding breastfeeding has been combined with the criterion regarding abstention.  
• The physical description of the IMP ha s been updated to “clear, colorless 
to yellow solution”. 
• The information to be recorded in the paper diary has been added to the synopsis for clarity. 
• The full 4-week safety follow-up period concludes with the safety follow-up visit. 
• Caregivers will record IMP intake in the paper diary but will not be 
required to record the volume of IMP administered on each treatment 
day. 
• The assessments listed as bullet points in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Visit 2 [Day 1]) must be conducted prior to receiving the first dose of IMP.

dosing time and the timing of concom itant AEDs and feeds/meals around 
the time of PK sampling. 
• Vital signs and clinical laboratory sa mples must be assessed/collected on 
Day 4. 
• In the OLE phase, all visit days and visit windows are in relation to 
Visit 2. 
• Medical history includes prior and current seizures/spasms. 
• The laboratory manual should be referred to for analysis of clinical laboratory samples. 
• Since local laboratories will be used, all laboratory results must be documented on the case report form. 
• The dose and number of times rescue medication is given each day will 
be recorded in the paper diary. 
• The patient’s parent(s)/legal repres entative would voluntarily withdraw 
the patient (rather than the patient withdrawing themself, due to their age). 
• All statistical analyses will be condu cted at the 5% level of significance. 
• The end of the evaluable period for the OLE phase is defined as the last 
day on which a study-related assessment was undertaken during the OLE phase as opposed to the last day on which the study IMP was taken. 
• Participation in the trial would not delay initiation with the next recognized IS therapy if the patient had failed all recognized IS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_312983]. 
• IMP will not be dispensed at the end of OLE treatment/withdrawal visit 
unless required for the taper period. 
• Investigator Global Impression of Change (IGIC) is updated to Physician Global Impression of Change (PGIC) for consistency with other GW trials. 
• Only a patient number will be used (screening numbers will not be utilized).

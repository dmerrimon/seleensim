PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 5 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/[ZIP_CODE]. Objectives
The objective of this study is to use thermal graphic imaging to objectively 
compare sensory nerve blockade distribution after placement of a Paravertebral 
peripheral nerve block vs. after placement of an Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425468].  
Participants will receive both types of block (one per side), rather than one type 
on both sides.  Both types are generally accepted, in common usage for this 
patient population, and applied frequently at UNM Outpatient and Imaging 
Services (OSIS) by [CONTACT_431].  Participants are drawn from a population that 
would already receive one or the other, depending on provider preference.
1.1. The investigators hypothesize that the two types of block procedures result in 
comparable anatomical distribution of effectiveness, as determined by [CONTACT_425492].
2. Background
Since the opening of the University of New Mexico Outpatient Day Surgery Center, 
breast surgery has been accomplished successfully due to regional anesthesia.  Before 
the development of ultrasound imaging, landmark paravertebral regional anesthesia 
blocks were placed before surgery to provide post-operative analgesia and enable 
patients to recover from their surgery in the comfort of their homes.  As ultrasound 
imaging technology was developed and became more mainstream, Paravertebral 
blocks were then placed using a combination of landmark and live ultrasound 
imaging while placing the blocks.   Ultrasound imaging of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_425469].  Imaging of bone creates artifact and drop out of the 
ultrasound image, therefore, creating great difficulty in performing this block under 
ultrasound-guidance.  At the same time, using ultrasound imaging to place these 
blocks, increases patient safety as the pleura of the lung can be imaged and therefore 
prevent inadvertent puncture of the lung by [CONTACT_425493].  As technology has 
further developed, resolution of the paravertebral space is improving and in the hands 
of experienced ultrasound-guided regional anesthesiologists this block can be placed 
successfully. 
The Paravertebral regional block is considered the gold-standard of anesthetizing the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_425470].i The block is placed as the spi[INVESTIGATOR_425471], the somatic and sympathetic parts of the nerve 
root are anesthetized.  Due to the complexity of placing this block, alternative blocks 
have been sought out that are easier to place and infer better safety for patients.  
Recently, the Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_104902] (ESP) block has been introduced as an alternative 
to the Paravertebral block.ii It is easier to place in the inexperienced providers hands, 
easier to teach to new providers and in patients with difficult anatomy sometimes the 
only safe image that can be obtained for placing a block.  The mechanism of action 
for the Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425472].  Contrast dye studies 
in cadavers, show that possibly the local anesthetic spreads to the paravertebral space 
anesthetizing the dorsal ramus of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_425473].iii 
Studies comparing the two blocks and their efficacy has had mixed results. It is 
difficult to objectively measure the blocks distribution and pain control.  Asking 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 6 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/2021patients’ their pain level after surgery is one subjective measure used and looking at 
patients’ morphine equivalents is another more objective method employed. In one 
systematic review done by [CONTACT_26134], they discovered that the Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425474] a Paravertebral Block.iv In another study conducted by [CONTACT_425494], using pain 
scores to assess the blocks’ efficacy, they concluded that thoracic Paravertebral 
blocks were associated with significantly lower pain scores than Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425475]-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.v
Finding an objective way to map blocking of a peripheral nerve would be an ideal 
way to compare the efficacy of the two blocks.  When we use regional anesthesia for 
the upper extremity surgery and anesthetizing the brachial plexus, we can objectively 
assess the success of the block by [CONTACT_425495].  If the nerve’s motor 
component is affected, we know the sensory component is affected also.  Therefore, 
loss of motor function serves as a surrogate to test loss of sensory function without 
having to cause pain to test the block.  Unfortunately, the thoracic nerves do not have 
a motor component.  The spi[INVESTIGATOR_425476] a somatic component and a 
sympathetic component.  When the sympathetic nervous system is block by [CONTACT_425496], the blood vessels in the distribution of the block are unable to 
vasoconstrict and therefore, vasodilated.   This vasodilatation leads to an increase in 
temperature of the skin of the trunk.  Being able to measure temperature changes of 
the skin in the dermatomes of where the block is placed would give us an objective 
measure to map where the block is blocking nerve signal transmission. 
Assessment of temperature change after Paravertebral block placement was first used 
in [ADDRESS_537613] 
of the two blocks.

PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 7 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/[ZIP_CODE]. Study Design
This will be an unblinded case series of consenting patients serving as their own 
controls in a comparison of two commonly accepted nerve blockade techniques.
4. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
4.1. Potential participants will be identified from among investigators’ usual patient 
caseload.  The inclusion/exclusion criteria are simple, and will not require the 
recording of any PHI.
4.2. Inclusion criteria: Participants will be drawn from adult female patients having 
bilateral mastectomy surgery over the age of 18.0 years, who consent to regional 
anesthesia for their postoperative pain relief.  Exclusion criteria: Patients will not 
be enrolled if they are not yet [ADDRESS_537614] a bleeding disorder, are pregnant (all female 
patients of childbearing age who present for surgery already receive a urine 
pregnancy test for non-research reasons), or do not speak English.
4.3. Individuals from these protected groups will not be included in this research:
Adults unable to consent
Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)
Pregnant women
Prisoners.
4.4. Male patients will be excluded.  Bilateral mastectomy surgery is rare in this 
patient group, and any male patients who do present for such surgery are likely to 
be experiencing a clinical situation that is distinct from the typi[INVESTIGATOR_425477]-
mastectomy population; potentially even idiopathic.  Enrolled male participants 
may therefore have an untoward effect on the interpretation of study results, and 
will be excluded for that reason.
4.5. Non-English speakers will be excluded.  This is a small unfunded study, and the 
cost of preparing suitable Spanish-language consent materials would present a 
substantial burden on the ability of the investigators to proceed.  The 
investigators are not aware of any reason why language preference would affect 
study results or even correlate with other factors that may affect them, or why 
results from the contemplated sample could not be reliably extrapolated to 
patients who speak languages other than English.
5. Number of Subjects
5.1. A maximum of [ADDRESS_537615] regional anesthesia.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 8 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/[ZIP_CODE]. Study Timelines
6.1. Describe:
Individual participants will participate in the study for less than one hour after 
providing consent, including time for block placement, time for the blocks to 
take effect, and the thermal imaging.  
The investigators anticipate that all subjects can be enrolled within 12 months.
Upon the completion of data collection, analysis and manuscript preparation 
are anticipated to take another five months.
7. Study Endpoints:
7.1. The primary outcome is the dermatomal distribution of skin temperature changes.  
No secondary outcomes have been identified.
7.2. The use of thermal imaging technology presents minimal risk to patients.  In the 
unexpected event that an excessive number of patients experience block failure 
(in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371]), the investigators will stop 
enrollment.  This is extremely unlikely, as both types of block are in common 
usage at OSIS with comparable success rates.
7.3. No exploratory endpoints have been identified.
8. Research Setting
8.1. Research activities will occur at the UNM HSC Outpatient Surgery and Imaging 
Services (OSIS) facility.
8.2. Physician-investigators on the study team will identify potential participants from 
among their usual patient caseload, using information already available to them.  
Recruitment will occur in the pre-operative holding areas of OSIS.
8.3. Recruitment, nerve block placement, and thermal imaging will occur in the pre-
operative holding areas of OSIS.  Post-recruitment analysis will occur in 
Anesthesiology department offices.
8.4. A community advisory board will not be used.
9. Resources Available
9.1.The PI (Mary Billstrand MD) is a board-certified anesthesiologist at UNM.  Her 
subspeciality area is regional anesthesia, where local anesthetics are used to 
provide surgical and analgesic pain relief by [CONTACT_425497].  She has supervised or personally place over 10,[ADDRESS_537616] this study by [CONTACT_425498].  She is the Medical Director of the Outpatient Surgical Center 
(OSIS) where the study will take place.  She has intimate knowledge of the study 
site, procedures, and patient population.  [CONTACT_425515] will be responsible for all 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 9 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/2021anesthesia-related medical decisionmaking, and ordering and evaluation of any 
diagnostics or therapeutics that become necessary in context of the research. 
9.2. Describe other resources available to conduct the research: For example, as 
appropriate:
Approximately two patients per month presents to OSIS for bilateral 
mastectomy.  Therefore, it is feasible that at least 12 patients can be recruited 
within 12 months.
Facilities at OSIS are designed to accommodate regional-anesthesia 
procedures, which are a standard of care for bilateral mastectomies performed 
there.
The Department of Anesthesiology has a thermal imaging camera (FLIR E95 
42).  
OSIS has the facilities, supplies, personnel, and equipment necessary to 
respond to any situations arising from regional anesthesia procedures and 
mastectomy surgery.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_425478]’ informed consent, perform their regional 
anesthesia procedures, and acquire thermal imaging.  There is a small subset 
of regional anesthesiologists (approximately 6 attending physicians and 2 
fellows) as well as midlevel, nursing, and resident physicians who will assist 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425479]-related matters outside the research, as in usual practice.  
While not performing research procedures per se, they will be made familiar 
with the research and its protocol-specified procedures.
10.Prior Approvals
10.1. The Departmental Review Form is included with this application.
11.Multi-Site Research
11.1. NA.
12.Study Procedures 
12.1. Nearly all procedures described below are routine and within standard of 
care (SOC), with two exceptions performed for research purposes: the use of 
thermal imaging to evaluate nerve block distribution, and the application of 
different nerve block techniques (Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425480], and 
paravertebral block on the contralateral side) in the same patient.  All participants 
are drawn from a population who would receive two blocks with the same 
technique, typi[INVESTIGATOR_425481], regardless of the existence of this research 
project.
12.2. Bilateral mastectomy patients will be identified before surgery.  Informed 
consent will be obtained. In the preoperative holding area at OSIS, patient will be 
positioned in sitting position and a universal time-out will be performed.  Patient 
will have surgical site marking by [CONTACT_425499]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_425482] a jar the side of the patient that 
the Paravertebral block will be placed on and the side that the Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425483].  Patient will be administered sedation via IV for 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 10 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/2021the procedure.  Thermal imaging photographs will be obtained using the Flir E95 
thermal imaging camera of the posterior, lateral and anterior thorax.   The first of 
three sets of images will be obtained before regional anesthesia (nerve block) 
placement.  Regional anesthesia will be performed as in usual practice for this 
patient population.  The specifics of the block placement will not be modified 
from our usual practice for purposes of this research project.  The patient will 
receive a Paravertebral block at T4 on one side and an Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425484] T4 on the contralateral side under ultrasound guidance.   Twenty 
minutes after the blocks are completed, thermal imaging photographs will be 
obtained of the posterior, lateral and anterior thorax.  Ten minutes later another 
set of thermal imaging photographs will be obtained.  The patient will then 
proceed to surgery.  Ultrasound images are all saved under patient’s MR per 
standard of care.  Thermographic images will be saved on secure HSC servers 
under a sequential participant number for later review and analysis. 
An example of the thermal image (from reference vii) is provided below:
13.Data Analysis
13.1. As this is a case series, formal statistical analysis beyond routine descriptive 
statistics is not appropriate.
13.2. As this is a case series, a power analysis is not appropriate.
14.Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects
The investigators believe that this is a Minimal Risk study, because enrolled patients 
would be offered regional anesthesia regardless of the existence of this study, there is not 
a substantial known difference in the success rates of the two regional-anesthesia 
techniques to be compared, the thermal imaging will not include patient identification, 
and there will be no deviation from standard procedures for Paravertebral and ESP block 
placement.
PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 11 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/202115.Withdrawal of Subjects
15.1. Sometimes due to subject’s anatomy a clear ultrasound image cannot be 
obtained and therefore a regional anesthetic cannot be safely administered.  
When this occurs, the patient will no longer be a candidate for the study and 
will be withdrawn.  The subject’s preblock thermal imaging will be deleted.
15.2. All other aspects of care will proceed as if the research did not exist, including 
accommodation for patients whose blocks cannot be performed.
15.3. Any patient who wishes to withdraw will be allowed to do so.  The investigators 
do not anticipate any patient insubordination issues as to research procedures, 
but any uncooperative patients will be removed from participation and surgery 
will proceed as normal depending on surgeon preference.  Similarly, any 
participants would be withdrawn if investigators conclude for any reason that 
their participation presents more risk than benefit.
15.4. If a subject withdraws or is withdrawn after thermal imaging is recorded, that 
subject’s thermal images will be deleted.
16.Data Management/Confidentiality
16.1. No data will be shared with any external entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371]. 
16.2. The research team includes physicians treating prospective and consented 
participants as patients in the course of their usual job duties, so access to PHI 
for these patients already exists and is routine.
16.3. The research requires access to identifiers and PHI for inclusion screening and 
demographic purposes.  The data to be used are not publicly available.  The 
only element of the data that may be considered “sensitive” is the thermal 
imaging of the anterior thorax (chest) area of consenting participants.  The 
thermal images do not resemble common photographs, but nonetheless 
necessarily include representations of adult women’s breasts (see example in 
section 12).  Other types of potentially sensitive data will not be sought or 
recorded.
16.4. Zip codes will not be recorded for research purposes. 
16.5. The investigators do not plan to seek or obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality 
from the NIH. 
16.6. Data will be secured by [CONTACT_425500], which are password-protected and feature numerous other security 
measures.
16.7. Data will be coded by [CONTACT_425501].
16.8. The data to be collected are relatively minimal and the sample size is small, so 
quality control is not anticipated to be an issue.  However, the linking sheet to 
MRN will permit any missing or unclear data to be checked and corrected as 
appropriate.
16.9. Describe the following:
PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 12 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/2021The data will include the thermal images and basic demographic data: age, 
BMI, and surgical procedure.
Data will be stored in electronic format on secure HSC servers.
Data will be collected electronically from the FLIR camera and entered 
electronically in files stored on secure HSC servers.
Data will be stored for 6 years, as with all other study documentation.
Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425485], except as provided by [CONTACT_425502].
16.10. The main set of data (the thermal images) will be temporarily stored on 
the FLIR camera, before being transferred to a folder on the secure HSC 
network and deleted from the camera.  The camera itself will be securely stored 
in a locked cabinet in Anesthesiology department offices.  
16.11. Audio and video recordings will not be made or used. 
16.12. Data will include thermal-imaging photographs, which will not include the 
facial area.  These photographs use false color to depi[INVESTIGATOR_425486], and as such are different from typi[INVESTIGATOR_425487].  Participants 
will be offered a look at the recorded images.  Images will be deleted on 
participant request, and the participant will then be excluded from the study. 
16.13. The research record will be maintained for at least 6 years after study 
completion. 
16.14.Research records for this study will not involve minors, as they are 
excluded from participation.
17.Data and Specimen Banking
17.1. Data will not be banked for future use. 
18.Risks to Subjects
18.1. Both of the regional anesthesia techniques under evaluation in this study are 
part of routine practice at UNM OSIS.  The research does not modify any 
element of patient selection for regional anesthesia or details of placement.  The 
only research-specific procedures are the use of two regional anesthesia 
techniques (rather than one) on consenting patients, and the recording of 
thermal imaging.  
18.2. Peripheral nerve blocks like the ones used in this research are necessarily 
restricted to one side of the body and must be performed bilaterally for bilateral 
anesthesia.  Therefore, some degree of risk of asymmetry in anesthesia 
effectiveness already exists regardless of the existence of this study.  For that 
reason, it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which any risk of anesthesia 
asymmetry may be increased by [CONTACT_31295], but it may exist; meaning that 
there is some small chance that a patient could have less pain control on one 
side.  As noted in the consent, previously unknown risks or side effects also 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 13 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/2021cannot be ruled out, but both techniques are well studied, so this is very 
unlikely.
18.3. The thermal images do not resemble normal photographs, but patients may 
experience unease while they are taken.
18.4. The only other risk identified by [CONTACT_425503], which exists in all research.
18.5. Both of the regional anesthetic techniques are well established with known 
safety profiles.  Similarly, thermal imaging carries no known inherent risks.  
Therefore, it is unlikely that this research would carry any unforeseeable risks.
18.6. All female patients of childbearing age at OSIS receive urine pregnancy tests 
prior to surgery.  Pregnant patients will be excluded, and the effects of regional 
anesthesia wear off within hours, so the investigators do not anticipate any risks 
posed to an embryo or fetus by [CONTACT_31295].
18.7. The investigators do not anticipate any risks posed to others not participating in 
the research.
18.8. The investigators have taken several steps to reduce or mitigate the probability 
and severity of risks.  These include, but are not limited to, 1) the use of routine 
regional anesthetic procedures and anesthetic dosages without research-specific 
modifications, 2) the exclusion of pregnant patients, 3) the use of minimal data 
to support this case series, 4) the routine availability of alternative pain relief 
methods (general anesthesia, intravenous analgesic medications, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, longer-acting oral pain medications, etc.) in any case 
of block failure, 5) the selection of established regional-anesthetic techniques to 
compare, 6) the availability of the full complement of personnel, supplies, and 
equipment to respond to any emergency, 7) the use of UNM HSC’s secure 
servers, locked cabinets, etc. to store data securely.
19.Potential Benefits to Subjects
19.1. Participants are drawn from a population that is already offered regional 
anesthesia for pain control, so there is no direct benefit from participation in this 
study.
20.Recruitment Methods
20.1. Patients having bilateral mastectomy procedures performed by [CONTACT_425504]. Sangeetha Prabhakaran will be referred to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425488].
Recruitment materials will not be used, other than the consent document.
21.Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
21.1. All study procedures will occur with a physician-investigator who is already 
interacting with prospective and consented patients as part of their routine job 
duties.  These procedures will occur in the pre-operative holding area, which is 
already sufficiently private for confidential doctor-patient conversations and 
medical procedures to occur.  The thermal imaging involves body areas that are 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 14 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/2021already exposed and discussed in the context of the medical treatment that 
constitutes part of the inclusion criteria.
22.Economic Burden to Subjects
The two types of regional anesthesia will be paid for by [CONTACT_425505]-
party payers.  Both of them are part of routine and standard care at UNM OSIS.  
The costs associated with the two regional anesthesia techniques are the same, 
so participant costs would not be affected by [CONTACT_50568].

22.1. Participation carries no other known costs. 
22.2. Adverse events attributable to the research are not anticipated, but if any occur, 
costs for their treatment would be paid by [CONTACT_8097]/or third-party payers.  
This is the same as for similar nonparticipants.
23.Compensation
23.1. Participants will not be compensated for their participation.
24.Compensation for Research-Related Injury
24.1. As the only research procedures are the use of thermal imaging and the use of 
two accepted regional-anesthesia techniques (all participants would receive one 
or the other of them regardless of the existence of this research), the 
investigators do not anticipate any research-related injuries and therefore do not 
anticipate any costs related to them.
25.Consent Process
25.1. Written consent will be obtained from all participants.
25.1.1. A study-team member (usually the PI) will obtain consent.  All study team 
members have HSC-mandated HIPAA and HITECH training, as well as 
CITI human-subjects and COI certifications.
25.1.2. The consent process will occur immediately after recruitment, in the 
private pre-operative holding areas at OSIS.
PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 15 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/202125.1.3. All prospective participants will be assured that participation has no effect 
on the care received.  For example, all nonparticipants are still candidates 
for regional anesthesia as in usual practice.  
25.1.4. The time available for prospective participants to consider their 
participation is the same as that in which they consider whether to receive 
regional anesthesia at all, and this study does not appreciably modify risks 
beyond confidentiality breach.  For those reasons, the investigators believe 
a suitable amount of time is available for patients to consider participation.
25.1.5. The study procedures are brief, so the investigators do not anticipate any 
issues with ongoing consent.  However, any participants who request 
deletion of the recorded thermal images will be assumed to have 
withdrawn consent, and their wishes will govern.
25.1.6. Investigators will use routine methods to ensure participant understanding, 
such as teachback, invitation for the patient to ask questions, and careful 
attention to the context and content of those questions.
Subjects not fluent in English
25.1.7. NA; subjects who prefer to speak a language other than English will not 
be enrolled.
Cognitively Impaired Adults/Adults Unable to Consent/Use of a Legally 
Authorized Representative
25.1.8. NA; these participants will not be enrolled.
Subjects who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)
25.1.9. NA.
Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (consent will not be obtained, required 
element of consent will not be included, or one or more required elements of 
consent will be altered) 
NA
26.Documentation of Consent
26.1. A written consent document will be used.
27.Study Test Results/Incidental Findings
27.1.Individual Results: The investigators do not plan to routinely share any 
individual results with participants.  The research does not involve any 
laboratory results or other findings that would carry clinical significance beyond 
the temporary effects of the regional anesthesia.  
27.2.Incidental Findings: Incidental findings are not anticipated in this research.  
28.Sharing Study Progress or Results with Subjects
PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 16 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/202128.1. The investigators do not plan to share study progress or overall study results 
with subjects.  Others’ experiences with the regional anesthesia are not directly 
relevant to individual patients.
29.Inclusion of Vulnerable Populations
29.1. NA; this research does not include any of the populations generally viewed as 
vulnerable.
30.Community-Based Participatory Research
NA.
31.Research Involving American Indian/Native Populations
31.1. While this study may incidentally enroll some Native American participants, it 
does not specifically target them for inclusion or exclusion, or seek to draw 
conclusions about Native Americans as a group.  
32.Transnational Research
32.1. NA
33.Drugs or Devices
33.1. The research does not modify the selection, dosage, or administration of any 
medications from usual practice.  The only modification from usual practice is 
the use of two accepted regional-anesthesia techniques rather than one or the 
other used bilaterally.
33.2. The study involves the use of a FLIR E95 thermal imaging camera as a means 
of recording data, in accordance with its usage instructions.
33.3. No investigational (IND) drugs will be used in this study.
34.Principal Investigator’s Assurance
By [CONTACT_273989], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_123858]:
☒ The information supplied in this form and attachments are complete and correct.  
☒ The PI [INVESTIGATOR_123859]’s Manual and will conduct this research in accordance 
with these requirements. 
☒ Data will be collected, maintained and archived or destroyed per HSC Data Security Best 
Practices, including:
1.Best Practice for data collection is to be directly entered onto a data collection 
form that is stored in a secured access folder on HSC central IT managed network 
storage (such as the N:\Research-Studies drive), or in a secure HSC Information 
Security approved system such as REDCap.
2. Temporary storage -- de-identified data collection, if done in a clinical setting 
or other setting that does not allow direct entry into a secured system, may be 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Dermatomal spread of Paravertebral and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425465] 17 of 23Template Version Date: 01/31/2021temporarily stored using encrypted removable (e.g. CD-ROM (a compact disc 
used as a read-only optical memory device for a computer system), USB 
flash/thumb drive (a small external flash drive that can be used with any computer 
that has a USB port), etc.) media or a university owned electronic storage device 
or hard copy document. This temporarily stored data must be transferred to HSC 
central IT managed network storage and deleted from the temporary device as 
soon as possible.  The important security safeguard is that no identifiers be 
included if the data is entered or stored using a storage container that is not 
managed by [CONTACT_425506].
3.Permanent (during data analysis, after study closure) storage must reside on 
HSC central IT managed network storage (such as the N:\Research-Studies 
Drive). Processing of data (aggregation, etc.) are to be carried out in such a way 
as to avoid creating/retaining files on untrusted or unsecure storage 
devices/computers (an example of an unapproved storage location would be 
storing the data locally on your HSC computer hard drive rather than on the HSC 
network drives). Trusted devices are HSC managed and provide one or more of 
following safeguards: access logs, encryption keys, backups, business continuity 
and disaster recovery capabilities.
4.Alternate storage media must be approve by [CONTACT_123899].

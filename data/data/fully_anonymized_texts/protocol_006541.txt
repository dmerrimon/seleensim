2Synopsis
Purpose
Patient portals provide secure online access to medical records with the capability of 
messaging providers, filling prescriptions, viewing educational materials, and accessing 
clinic services. There is considerable evidence documenting disparities in patient portal 
use. Adults who are elderly, Black, Latinx, and those with low socioeconomic status (SES) 
and low health literacy are less likely to use patient portals as an adjunct to clinical care 
(Anthony et al. 2018; Grossman et al, 2019). Concern has been raised that this well-
intentioned solution for patient-centered care may actually worsen health inequities unless 
portal use among the underserved is actively increased (Grossman et al, 2019; Veinot et 
al. 2018). 
Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a multi-level intervention 
aimed at increasing access and use of patient portals for diabetes management 
(MAP) in community health centers (CHCs). There are [ADDRESS_310382] completed Phase 1 
of the study. 
We are now seeking IRB approval for Phase 2.

Objectives
Aim 1. Optimize components of the MAP intervention for adults with T2D who 
access healthcare at CHCs. To accomplish this aim, we will conduct interviews/focus 
groups with adults with T2D and health care providers (n=24) from two CHCs to inform 
details of intervention design and to identify perceived barriers and facilitators to the delivery 
of the intervention. We will use these qualitative findings to finalize the MAP protocol.  
Aim 2. Determine the effect size of MAP on the primary outcomes of portal use 
(number of logins) and A1C, among adults with T2D (n=30) who access healthcare at two 
CHCs. Secondary outcomes include: a) patient engagement with care (clinic appointments, 
referrals, ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], use of community resources for social determinants of 
health); b) T2D clinical management (EMR data of A1C, blood pressure, lipid profile, BMI); 
c) T2D self-management (medication, blood glucose monitoring, healthy eating, physical 
activity); d) psychosocial outcomes (diabetes self-efficacy, autonomy support, and diabetes 
distress); e) technology outcomes (digital literacy, acceptance/use/confidence); and f) 
satisfaction. Using a within subjects, pre-post design we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_255489] 30 adults with T2D 
who are not currently using the patient portal. Data will be collected at baseline, 3, and 6

3months. We will also rigorously evaluate the feasibility of MAP using an established 
framework (acceptability, demand, implementation, adaptation, and integration). 
Study Population
Adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D)  of diverse race/ethnicity who access healthcare at 
community health centers (CHCs) will participate in the study. There are significant racial 
and ethnic disparities in the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of T2D. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_255490], these disparities persist. Racial/ethnic 
minorities are more likely to have poor glycemic control (Kiek et al, 2006), to develop 
diabetes-related complications (Osborn et al. 2013) and 1.5-2.3 times more likely to die 
from diabetes than whites (Spanakis et al. 2013).  Further, minorities have been particularly 
affected by [CONTACT_4113]-19, with increased risk for infection, morbidity, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and 
mortality (Yancy 2020) Preexisting conditions, including and especially diabetes, increase 
risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes (Richardson et al. 2020). Thus, innovative approaches 
are urgently needed to address health inequities in T2D.
Increased patient portal use has the potential to increase engagement with care and 
improve diabetes health outcomes. Yet, despi[INVESTIGATOR_255491], disparities in portal use continue. To date, no interventions on 
portal adoption have targeted adults with T2D of diverse race/ethnicity with limited 
resources, who have unique structural and social barriers to portal access, use, and 
diabetes self-management.
We will target adults with T2D who access health care at CHCs because CHCs play a 
critical role in addressing health inequities in T2D, providing care to over [ADDRESS_310383] CHC patients (92%) live in poverty or near-poverty as defined by [CONTACT_255509]; are disproportionately from racial/ethnic minority groups (total 
63%:32% Hispanic, 22% Black, 9% other minorities); and have high rates of chronic 
conditions compared to the general population.

4Study Design
In Phase 1 we will use a qualitative descriptive design, convening interviews/focus groups 
with stakeholders to guide the development of MAP. During this phase we will finalize the 
intervention protocol and develop promotional and training materials.
In Phase 2, we will evaluate the preliminary efficacy and feasibility of MAP using a pre-
post design. 
Study Duration
The study will last for two years. We anticipate completing Phase [ADDRESS_310385] for 6 months. 
Outcome Variables
In Phase 1, there are no outcome variables. 
In Phase 2, our primary outcomes include portal use (e.g., number of logins) and 
glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) measured with a fingerstick of blood and analyzed with 
the A1CNow+ system. Secondary outcomes include: patient portal engagement (number 
of clinic appointments, use of community resources, medication refills, ER visits, and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255492] 3 months). Other secondary outcomes include T2D 
clinical management (EMR data of A1C, blood pressure, lipid profile, BMI), self-
management (medication, blood glucose monitoring, healthy eating, physical activity), 
psychosocial outcomes (diabetes self-efficacy, autonomy support, diabetes distress) 
technology acceptance/use/confidence, and satisfaction. 
We will also collect data on the intervention implementation which will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_255510], # of rescheduled/reminders for sessions, 
and how the portal was used by [CONTACT_1962], CHWs, nurses, and providers. Implementation 
will also be measured via treatment fidelity. Lastly, we will use field notes and meeting 
notes from training and communication with interventionists to determine barriers and 
facilitators to program implementation.

121 Background
1.1 Background
Patient portals provide secure online access to medical records with the capability of 
messaging providers, filling prescriptions, viewing educational materials, and accessing clinic 
services. There is considerable evidence documenting disparities in patient portal use. Adults 
who are elderly, Black, Latinx, and those with low socioeconomic status (SES) and low health 
literacy are less likely to use patient portals as an adjunct to clinical care (Anthony et al, 2018; 
Grossman et al. 2019). Concern has been raised that this well-intentioned solution for patient-
centered care may actually worsen health inequities unless portal use among the underserved 
is actively increased (Grossman et al., 2019; Veinot et al. 2018: Lorenc et al 2013). 
Portal adoption interventions can successfully increase portal use. In a systematic 
review of interventions to increase portal use in vulnerable populations, 67% of studies (12/18) 
showed a signiﬁcant increase in portal use, predictors of use, or reduced disparities. Free or 
low-cost internet access, technical training and assistance, and proactive outreach from the 
healthcare team through the portal have the strongest evidence for improving health equities 
in portal use and outcomes (Lorenc et al 2013). In the general population, patient portal use 
has been shown to increase patient engagement with office visits and decrease emergency 
room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (Reed et al., 2019). Patient portal use also increases patient 
knowledge, self-efficacy, decision-making, medication use, and preventive screening (Han et 
al, 2019). In adults with diabetes, greater portal use of secure messaging with providers led 
to improved glycemic control (A1C) compared to non-users (Dekvota et al, 2016: Chung et al. 
2017; Harris et al, 2018; Kuo et al, 2016).  Other trials have demonstrated significant 
reductions in A1C through diabetes self-management support and education via the portal 
(Tang et al, 2013; Ralston et al, 2009;  Alturkistani et al, 2020).  Thus, fostering communication 
with providers and diabetes self-management support are promising features of portals for 
adults with diabetes. However, to date there are no interventions promoting engagement in 
clinical care and diabetes self-management via patient portals in adults with type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) of diverse race/ethnicity who experience considerable health disparities. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) Social Determinants of Health Equity provides 
a useful framework for reducing disparities in patient portal use. It posits that socioeconomic 
position produces health disparities through four intermediary factors - material 
circumstances, psychosocial factors, behavioral/biological factors, and the healthcare system. 
We will develop and evaluate a multi-level intervention aimed at increasing access and use of 
patient portals for diabetes management (MAP) in community health centers (CHCs). MAP 
will intervene on each intermediary factor of the WHO framework. Specifically, MAP will: 1) 
provide free access to tablets and internet (material circumstances); 2) deliver technology 
training and support (psychosocial factors); 3) assess social determinants of health and refer 
to community resources (material circumstances); and, 4) provide diabetes self-management 
support and referral to clinic services (behavioral/biological factors). MAP will be delivered by 
[CONTACT_255511]’ healthcare system. 
Intervention components will be tailored for low-literacy, low-numeracy adults and 
communications will be designed to increase participant’s autonomy for portal use and 
diabetes self-management. We hypothesize that MAP will increase portal use and patient 
engagement with health care, improve diabetes self-management and psychosocial 
outcomes, and ultimately improve glycemic control.

demonstrated substantial disparities in portal use (Grossman et al, 2019). In a systematic 
review of patient portal interventions for adults of diverse race/ethnicity and limited resources, 
technical training was the most effective strategy in improving patient portal logins, use of 
features, and secure messaging (Grossman et al. 2019). Interventions promoting patient 
portal use, such as accessing medical records and secure messaging with provider, improve 
knowledge, self-efficacy, and medication adherence in adults with chronic illnesses6 and 
glycemic control in adults with diabetes (Tang et al, 2013: Alturkistani et al, 2020; Harris et al, 
2013). To date, no interventions on portal adoption have targeted adults with T2D of diverse 
race/ethnicity with limited resources, who have unique structural and social barriers to portal 
access, use, and diabetes self-management. 
CHCs play a critical role in addressing health inequities in T2D, providing care to over 
27 million people in the US (National Association of Community Health Centers, 2020). The 
aim of CHCs is to provide affordable, high quality, comprehensive primary care to medically 
underserved populations, regardless of insurance status or ability to pay for care. Most CHC 
patients (92%) live in poverty or near-poverty as defined by [CONTACT_255512]; are 
disproportionately from racial/ethnic minority groups (total 63%:32% Hispanic, 22% Black, 9% 
other minorities); and have high rates of chronic conditions compared to the general 
population. In 2018, 21% of adults seen at CHCs had T2D compared to 11% in the general 
population. Our goal, therefore, is to determine the effect of a multi-level intervention to 
increase patient portal use among adults with T2D who access healthcare at CHCs by 
[CONTACT_255513], home internet, and technology support, as well as personalized care to 
improve engagement with health care and diabetes self-management. 
Social determinants of health are important considerations in developi[INVESTIGATOR_255493] T2D who access care at CHCs. The Social Determinants of Health Equity 
framework (Soar & Irwin, 2010), developed by [CONTACT_14300], posits that socioeconomic and 
political context contribute to one’s socioeconomic position, with populations stratified based 
on education, occupation, and income (Figure 1). These structural determinants of health 
operate through intermediary and social determinants of health to shape health outcomes. 
Intermediary and social determinants include material circumstances (e.g., access to 
tablets/internet, food 
security), behavioral 
and/or biological 
factors (e.g., taking 
medications), 
psychosocial factors 
(e.g., technology 
literacy), and the 
health care system 
(access to care). By

self-management support into the portal adoption intervention and thus expect not only 
increased portal use but also improved diabetes self-management and glycemic control

There is a risk of loss of confidentiality. All practices completed in Phase 1 to decrease this 
risk will be followed in Phase 2. All participants will participate in an intervention that includes 
education and support on how to log in and use the patient portal and nurse coaching on 
diabetes self-management via the patient portal. There is a slight risk of hypoglycemia if 
diabetes self-management is improved; however, all participants will be receiving the nurse

and an approximately 6 month data plan (until study completion). They will be able to keep 
the tablet at the end of the study. Participants may learn how to better manage their 
diabetes, enjoy communicating with their nurse about their diabetes and may feel like they 
are contributing to knowledge on diabetes self-management in adults with T2D.  Some 
pariticipants may improve their glycemic control.

173 Study Purpose and Objectives
3.1 Purpose
The purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a multi-level intervention aimed at 
increasing access and use of patient portals for diabetes management (MAP) in community 
health centers (CHCs). There are [ADDRESS_310397] 
interviews/focus groups with adults with T2D and health care providers (n=24) from two CHCs 
to inform details of intervention design and to identify perceived barriers and facilitators to the 
delivery of the intervention. We will use these qualitative findings to finalize the MAP protocol.  
The primary objective of Phase [ADDRESS_310398] size of MAP on the primary 
outcomes of portal use (number of logins) and A1C, among adults with T2D (n=30) who 
access healthcare at two CHCs. Secondary outcomes include: a) patient engagement with 
care (clinic appointments, referrals, ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], use of community resources 
for social determinants of health); b) T2D clinical management (EMR data of A1C, blood 
pressure, lipid profile, BMI); c) T2D self-management (medication, blood glucose monitoring, 
healthy eating, physical activity); d) psychosocial outcomes (diabetes self-efficacy, autonomy 
support, and diabetes distress); e) technology outcomes (digital literacy, 
acceptance/use/confidence); and f) satisfaction. Using a within subjects, pre-post design we 
will pi[INVESTIGATOR_255489] 30 adults with T2D who are not currently using the patient portal. Data will be 
collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. We will also rigorously evaluate the feasibility of MAP 
using an established framework (acceptability, demand, implementation, adaptation, and 
integration).

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 9/18/2023Protocol Number [PHONE_5320] Sept 6, 2023, Version [ADDRESS_310399] will 
be conducted in two phases. In Phase 1 we will use a qualitative descriptive design, convening 
interviews/focus groups with stakeholders to guide the development of MAP. During this phase 
we will finalize the intervention protocol and develop promotional and training materials. In 
Phase 2 we will train personnel in intervention delivery (one community health worker [CHW] 
and one nurse at each CHC) and inform other health care providers at the clinics (e.g., 
physicians, pharmacists) about MAP. We will then implement MAP and evaluate the 
preliminary efficacy and feasibility of MAP using a pre-post design. IRB approval will be 
obtained prior to start-up of Phase 2.
In Phase 2, we will use a pre-post design, collecting data from participants at baseline, 3 and 
6 months. We will evaluate change over time in participants.

We will also collect data on the intervention implementation which will be assessed by [CONTACT_255516], # of rescheduled/reminders for sessions, and how 
the portal was used by [CONTACT_1962], CHWs, nurses, and providers. Implementation will also be 
measured via treatment fidelity. Lastly, we will use data from all field notes of trainings and 
meetings with interventionists to determine barriers and facilitators to implementation.

5.4 Recruitment Procedures 
Phase 1:
We will use convenience and purposive sampling through flyers at clinics, in-person 
recruitment by [CONTACT_21171] (RAs), social media advertisements at clinics, and 
recommendations from clinic leadership and participants. 
For providers, we will use convenience and purposive sampling to achieve variation in type 
of provider (e.g. MD or NP), age, gender, and race/ethnicity. For CHWs, we will seek 
diversity in years at CHC, gender, and race/ethnicity. For adults with T2D, we will also use 
convenience and purposive sampling to achieve variation in use of portals (never users, 
occasional users, frequent users) as well as variation in age, gender, race/ethnicity, and 
duration of T2D. 
Interested participants will be invited to contact [CONTACT_255517]. At the first contact, a trained research assistant will determine eligibility 
using an established script. If eligible and interested, the research assistant will inform the

266 Study Methods/Procedures
6.1 Study Procedures
Phase I:
Interested participants will be screened by a trained research assistant using a script. If not 
eligible or interested, people will be thanked for their time. 
If eligible and interested, we will obtain informed consent as previously described. We will 
also collect data via focus groups, scheduling individual interviews if logistical challenges 
arise. There will be different semi-structured interview/focus group guides for clinic personnel 
and patients. Focus groups will be composed of the same subject group – all providers or all 
patients. Interviews/focus groups with stakeholders will be conducted by [CONTACT_255520] a bilingual RA.  Participants of focus groups/interviews will be asked to talk 
about their experiences with patient portals. Specifically, participants will be asked to 
describe barriers and facilitators to patient portal use for engagement in diabetes care, 
technology needs, and feedback on the proposed content and procedures of MAP. 
Providers and CHWs will complete a demographic survey on age, sex, race/ethnicity, type of 
provider, years in practice, and years at CHC. Adults with T2D will be asked to provide data 
on age, sex, race/ethnicity, type of insurance, duration of T2D, most recent A1C, and years 
receiving care at CHC. If adults with T2D cannot recall their most recent A1C, we will ask 
them to contact [CONTACT_255521] a later date. 
All interviews/focus groups will be scheduled at convenient times for participants, via ZOOM 
or in-person if it is safe to do so. If focus groups are conducted via ZOOM, participants will 
be asked to change their name [CONTACT_1639] a pseudonym prior to entry into the focus group. 
Interview/focus groups will be conducted in Spanish as needed. Interviews/focus groups will 
be audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and Spanish transcripts translated to English. No 
videos will be recorded for ZOOM interviews. 
Phase 2:
For recruitment, flyers will be posted at the clinic and clinicians will be encouraged to refer 
eligible participants. Information about the study will also be posted on clinic social media 
channels. Interested recruits will be screened by a language concordant trained RA using a 
script. If not eligible or interested, people will be thanked for their time. 
If eligible and interested, a trained RA will enroll participants from the CHCs. The RA will 
obtain written informed consent and collect data (in English or Spanish depending on 
preference). We will use REDCapTM, an NIH-supported, FDA-compliant electronic data 
capture application for data collection and storage. RAs will enter data at the time of data 
collection into the database via tablets. Trained RAs or nurses will obtain point-of-care A1C 
values with a fingerstick of blood, following all protocols for safety.    
All participants who enroll in the study will receive standard T2D care at their CHC and the 
MAP intervention. The MAP intervention consists of 4 components:
1. Supplies/Needs: Provision of tablet, provision of an approximately 6-month data 
plan (until study completion), and referral for community resources such as food or 
housing assistance. Participants will keep the tablet after they finish the study. 
Tablets will be set to the appropriate language (English or Spanish per participants 
preference).

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 9/18/2023Protocol Number [PHONE_5320] Sept 6, 2023, Version 5
272. Technology Training: In-person training and ongoing support on how to use the 
patient portal with their tablet by [CONTACT_255522] (CHW) or nurse 
from the respective clinics. The CHW or nurse will give participants their tablet with 
data plan. They will meet 1:1 with participants in person or by [CONTACT_223938]. Sessions 
will cover: 1) how to use the tablet; 2) how to use the portal; 3) social determinants 
needs assessment; and 4) connection to community resources. The number, 
duration, and spacing of sessions will be determined by [CONTACT_255523], but it is anticipated that participants will have 4-[ADDRESS_310405] month of the intervention. 
Sessions will be conducted face-to-face in the clinic or over secure telemedicine 
through MyChart/Healow. During the first or second session, the interventionist will 
conduct a screening for the social determinants of health (eg, housing, food, 
utilities). According to existing clinic protocol, participants with any such needs will 
be given referrals to community resources and assistance with accessing them such 
as completing an application for subsidized housing or obtaining groceries from a 
food bank.
Attendance will be recorded and CHWs will complete a fidelity checklist after each 
session. The CHWs will remind participants about sessions. Once technology 
competence has been established through a teach-back method, participants will 
be connected with the nurse at each site. Interventionists will remain available after 
these sessions are concluded, in case participants have additional needs/questions 
regarding material needs and/or tablet/portal use. Participants will be given the 
contact [CONTACT_255524]. 
See Appendix X for details of this component of the intervention.
3. Diabetes Support: Diabetes self-management support will be provided by a nurse 
via the patient portal. The nurse will have an initial in person or telehealth session 
with participants to assess their diabetes self-management challenges and 
successes. Nurses will assess for depressive symptoms at their initial session with 
participants using the PHQ-2 (an established depressive symptom screener for 
primary care). Participants will be informed of a positive screen and advised to 
contact [CONTACT_255525]. Primary care 
providers will also be informed of a positive screen. At this meeting the nurse and 
participant will co-create a diabetes self-management plan aligned with their 
treatment plan prescribed by [CONTACT_3038]’ primary care provider. The nurse will 
work with each patient to individualize diabetes behavioral targets, considering the 
following priorities: use of the portal, attendance at appointments, uploading of 
blood glucose data to the portal, medication refills and adherence, and lifestyle 
and emotional factors. After this initial session, the nurse will proactively contact 
[CONTACT_255526] 2 times/week or as clinically indicated for 
3 months to check-in, provide diabetes education, provide motivational support, 
and/or answer any participant questions about their diabetes. After 3 months, the 
nurse will check-in with participants one time per week. See Appendix X for details 
of the intervention. 
4. Text Messages: CHWs and nurses may also send text message reminders to 
participants for appointments or to check/use patient portal.
MAP will follow guidelines for health care for low-literacy and low-numeracy patients with 
diabetes (For example, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_255495], presenting information in small chunks, use 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_255496]). In addition, all contacts between the nurse or CHW and 
participant will be guided by [CONTACT_255527]. Autonomy support refers to a 
patient’s perception that their healthcare provider recognizes the person’s personal agency,

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 9/18/2023Protocol Number [PHONE_5320] Sept 6, 2023, Version [ADDRESS_310406] Training
CHWs and nurses from each CHC will receive training on the MAP protocol that will entail 
self-study, small group class sessions, and live practice. Training is anticipated to require the 
equivalent of approximately 2 days for CHWs and nurses, with homework and practice 
between training sessions. Training will cover: orientation to research and goals of the study; 
human subjects protection; protocol and documentation; and, team roles, responsibilities, 
and supervision. Training will also cover details of the intervention content through materials 
made for this study. CHWs and nurses will be taught specific strategies for working with low-
literacy/low-numeracy individuals. 
Training will also teach CHWs and nurses how to provide autonomy support to participants. 
Research shows that autonomy support can be learned and practiced.48-51 Through scripts, 
role-play, and illustrative case examples, they will be trained to use specific techniques such 
as acknowledging the participant perspective, identifying participant goals, emphasizing 
participant responsibility, and providing encouragement. The co-PIs will observe role plays 
and complete treatment fidelity checklists; CHWs and nurses will be allowed to deliver the 
intervention to participants only after the PIs judge that their skill level is sufficient. Drs. 
Wagner and Whittemore have extensive experience training CHWs and nurses in delivery of 
behavioral interventions. After the formal training, the PIs, the study nurse and CHW will 
meet approximately weekly during the first four weeks of intervention delivery and bi-weekly 
thereafter or as indicated by [CONTACT_7676]. Clinics will be compensated for the salary of the nurse 
and CHW for training, delivering the intervention, and completing study tasks.
Follow-up data will be collected at 3 and 6 months. At each data collection session, an 
appointment for the next data collection session will be scheduled. Participants will be sent a 
text message, email message, phone call, or calendar reminder (based on preference) for 
data collection appointments (3, 2, and 1 day prior). To maximize retention, we will explain 
all study procedures in the informed consent process, provide escalating incentives for study 
assessments, and collect data on alternate contact [CONTACT_122473]. Our research team has ample 
experience with longitudinal research demonstrating successful retention with hard to reach 
populations including Latinx adults with T2D. Study participants will received compensation 
for data collection (Baseline $40.00, 3-month $40.00, 6-month $60.00)
6.1.1 Data Collection
Phase 1: Data for interviews/focus groups will be conducted using a semi-structured 
interview guide. Participants – healthcare providers/community health workers and adults 
with T2D – will participate in one interview or focus group which will last approximately 1 
hour and a half. Interview data will provide information on perceived barriers, facilitators, 
and needs of stakeholders on patient portal use/non-use. Our stakeholders are providers 
who will be communicating with patients via the patient portal and adults with T2D who will 
be using the patient portal to learn more about their diabetes and communicate their needs 
to their provider. Data will be collected via audio-recordings and recordings will be 
transcribed verbatim. Data will be coded and summarized per established and rigorous 
procedures. All data will be stored with a participant ID only. The code linking a participant

29to their code number will be maintained in a separate file on a secure server at Yale (eg. 
Secure Box). No identifying data will be included in transcripts (eg. if a name [CONTACT_255540]). 
Phase 2: Participant data for this phase will consist of self-report data by [CONTACT_4317] 
(demographic and medical history data, study questionnaires), laboratory data (fingerstick 
glycosylated hemoglobin A1C), electronic medical record data (e.g. body mass index, 
recent laboratory data), and patient portal data (e.g., number of logins, number of 
messages sent/received, content of messages sent/received) (see Table 1). All 
questionnaires have demonstrated adequate reliability and validity. 
Data will also be obtained on program implementation, fidelity, and barriers/facilitators to 
implementation from meeting field notes. 
All data will be stored with a participant ID only. The code linking a participant to their code 
number will be maintained in a separate file from the data files on a secure computer from 
Yale. No identifying data from field notes will be recorded.

Phase I: Not applicable
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related. 
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view 
of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-
threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to

For Phase 1, we will be interviewing participants and there is no intervention. 
For Phase 2, risk of the study is considered minimal and adverse events are defined in Table 
2:
Adverse event Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical 
exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or 
not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research 
Serious adverse 
eventAny adverse event that:
1. results in death;
2. is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred);
3. results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]; (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255498])
4. results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
5. results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or
6. based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this 
definition (e.g., allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in the emergency room or at home, convulsions that

drug dependency or drug abuse).
Unanticipated 
problemsAny incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following 
criteria:
1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) 
the research procedures that are described in the IRB-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; 
and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied;
2. related or possibly related to participation in the research 
(reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_32015]); and
3. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a 
greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.
The research team will meet with RNs at least every 2 weeks during study implementation. 
The RNs, CHW, and/or research team will report adverse events or unanticipated problems 
that they identify during the intervention implementation at research meetings. The PIs will 
solicit more information about the event if needed and will determine if it’s serious 
orunanticipated, using the definitions identified in the table above.  Serious adverse events, 
deaths or unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects encountered during the study will 
be reported by [CONTACT_255528]. In 
addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_48105]-up immediately to elicit as much information as possible about the 
event. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_255499]. The decision to terminate participation for a study participant due to

337 Statistical Design
7.1 Sample Size Considerations
Phase 1: Not applicable
Phase 2: Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_255502] a future large study, we 
conducted a power analysis to show an effect size on A1C using a feasible sample size of 
[ADDRESS_310407] error of 0.13. Therefore, 
the proposed sample size of 30 could estimate a change of A1C over time with a margin of 
±0.27% A1C for 95% confidence interval.  
7.2 Planned Analyses
Phase I analysis:
The sample of participants in the interviews/focus groups will be described using frequency 
distributions and appropriate summary statistics (SAS version 9.4). Content analysis will be 
used to analyze qualitative data from each type of stakeholder along with field notes and 
interviewer observations (Hsieh, 2005)  Rigor for this process includes: (a) transcribing taped 
interviews; (b) checking transcripts against tapes for accuracy; (c) developi[INVESTIGATOR_255503]; (d) assigning codes of text with 
appropriate checks; (e) reviewing coded data to identify themes across participants; and (f) a 
team approach to data analysis. At research team meetings we will assess researcher bias, 
coding saturation, and interpretative congruence. Results will be used to finalize the 
intervention protocol for implementation in Phase 2

Nov 2005;15(9):1277-88. 
Phase 2 Analysis: Data will be collected in the form of questionnaires online on the 
secure REDCap system. A1C data, electronic medical record data and patient portal data will 
entered into REDCap or Excel and meged into one database. All data that are downloaded 
from REDCap or Excel will be onto a Yale server, which has several secure firewall systems.. 
Descriptive analyses will be performed to assess demographic and clinical characteristics of 
the sample. Feasibility data will be summarized. Distributions of outcome variables will be 
examined for central tendency and dispersion. We will estimate the Cohen’s D effect size of 
MAP on A1C and will examine the intervention effect over 6 months using generalized linear 
mixed model (GLMM) with random intercept, which will incorporate the correlation within 
repeatedly measured A1C. The slope of time will represent the average change of A1C over 
[ADDRESS_310408]-
intervention value and will handle missing data using maximum likelihood approach. To 
confirm findings with missing data, we will rerun the GLMM with multiple imputations which 
will be produced by [CONTACT_255533] A1C. 
Number of logins and the repeatedly measured secondary outcomes will be analyzed with the 
same approach using the GLMM. Residuals will be assessed for normality assumption and

34variables will be transformed with an appropriate form when the normality assumption does 
not hold. Count data such as portal use, clinic appointments, ER visits, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255504]. For exceeding zero 
count (i.e. a high proportion of no appointment, ER visit, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), zero-inflated 
regression models will be employed. We will also estimate the effects of portal use (frequency, 
type) and feasibility factors (e.g., acceptability, attendance, fidelity) on A1c at 6 months after 
controlling for baseline A1c using generalized linear model (GLM). For future research with a 
large sample size, we will obtain an effect size (partial eta square) of each factor from GLM. 
Qualitative data will be analyzed using the aforementioned content analysis approach.

7.3 Data Relevance
Phase 1: Qualitative data collected from our stakeholders – healthcare providers/community 
health workers of CHCs and adults with T2D who access care at CHCs – will provide 
information on the barriers, facilitators, and needs related to an intervention to increase 
patient portal use for diabetes care. This will allow us to complete our study aim which is to 
optimize components of the MAP intervention for adults with T2D who access healthcare at 
CHCs. We will use these qualitative findings to finalize the MAP protocol.  
Phase 2: Data collected from participants, the electronic medical record, and patient portal 
will provide important information on whether the provision of material resources (tablet and 
data plan), technology assistance, and nursing education and support increases use of the 
patient portal and engagement with diabetes care. Adults with T2D who access clinical care 
at community health centers often do not have consistent engagement with clinical care, 
particularly through the patient portals. Use of patient portals has been shown to improve 
health care outcomes; thus, the data in this study will help us understand if our approach 
has the potential to improve health outcomes in this population. 
7.4 Data Coding
Phase 1: We will used established content analysis procedures to code the data. Initially we 
will develop coding categories by [CONTACT_255534]. Next we will assign 
codes to text in our transcripts with appropriate checks (having the 2 coders independently 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 9/18/2023
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 9/18/2023Protocol Number [PHONE_5320] Sept 6, 2023, Version [ADDRESS_310410] 2 transcripts and check codes for agreement and resolve discrepancies). If the 
2 coders cannot resolve discrepancies, these will be discussed with the Co-PIs. Once all 
data are coded, we will review coded data to identify themes across participants. During this 
process, we will use a team approach to data analysis to enhance rigor. At research team 
meetings we will assess researcher bias, coding saturation, and interpretative congruence.
Phase 2: Quantitative data will be coded based on a pre-determined system (either by 
[CONTACT_20526] a number to specific characteristic or by [CONTACT_255535]). De-identified data from REDCap will be downloaded into our statistical software 
for data analysis. For open-ended questions on Technology Barriers and Facilitators, we will 
use a content analysis method to code participant responses into categories in order to 
describe the most common barriers and facilitators. 
7.5 Data Analysis Tools
Phase 1: We will use SAS or EXCEL to describe the sample. We will use NIVIVO, a 
qualitative data analysis software to analyze interview data. 
Phase 2: We will use SAS or EXCEL to describe the sample. 
7.6 Data Monitoring
Phase 1: Not applicable
Phase 2: The co-PIs (Whittemore and Wagner) are responsible for monitoring individual 
events and determining whether the study protocol needs modification to minimize risk.
The research team will have at least monthly meetings to review individual cases and ensure 
close monitoring of participants.  If the team considers it appropriate, with a signed release 
of information from the participant, we will give any relevant information regarding the 
participant's health to their medical care providers.
7.7 Handling of Missing Data
 Phase 1: Not applicable
Phase 2: To confirm findings with missing data, we will rerun the GLMM with multiple 
imputations which will be produced by [CONTACT_255536] A1C. Number of logins and the repeatedly measured secondary 
outcomes will be analyzed with the same approach using the GLMM.

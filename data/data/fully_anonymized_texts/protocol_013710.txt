Lay Summary  of Proposed Research 
Lay Summary of Proposed Research
Schizophrenia (SZ) is a prevalent, debilitating, and costly illness. Currently available treatments are often 
either only partially effective or associated with significant side effects. Thus, newer treatments are 
desperately required.
All current treatments for SZ function primarily by [CONTACT_47506] D2-type dopamine receptors. An alternative 
theory of SZ comes from studies of microbial pathology and SZ that postulate disturbances of cytokines and 
inflammatory mediators in SZ. Ecologic data have suggested associations between early pregnancy 
infection and the development of SZ in offspring of infected mothers. Additionally, lifetime infection with 
Protocol Summary Form

Toxoplasma gondii substantially increases the risk of SZ, while epi[INVESTIGATOR_46294], studies on the effects of 
Toxoplasma gondii infection in humans and rodents, and results of the effects of antipsychotic medications 
on Toxoplasma gondii implicate this organism in risk for SZ.
One of the main mediators of the effects of infection/inflammation in the human body is cytokines. Recent 
data suggest that cytokines, and in particular IL-6, may mediate the effects of lifetime or prenatal infection 
on SZ risk. Preclinical models of SZ support a convergence between a role for IL-6 in the pathophysiology 
of SZ and the major neurochemical hypotheses of SZ-the dopamine and glutamate hypotheses. Namely, IL-
6 dysfunction or excess promotes SZ-like behaviors and SZ-like biochemical and electrophysiological 
profiles, while IL-6 knockout or neutralization mitigates these abnormalities. Furthermore, plasma IL-6 
levels are elevated in acutely psychotic but not treated patients, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 
studies have shown active inflammation in the brains of individuals with psychosis. Finally, treatment of 
individuals with SZ with non-specific anti-inflammatory agents, such as celecoxib and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], has 
suggested a role for anti-inflammatory agents in SZ. These data also suggest that studies of immunologic 
agents that more specifically target the underlying pathophysiology of SZ may be more efficacious. 
Tocilizumab (Actemra®) is an FDA-approved humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL-[ADDRESS_375949] a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-
blind clinical trial of tocilizumab as add-on treatment for residual positive, negative, and cognitive 
symptoms in SZ. After a two-week baseline measurement, a 12-week treatment phase (i.e., three doses of 
study drug), adjunctive to antipsychotics, will begin, with 18 individuals randomly assigned to tocilizumab 
and 18 individuals to placebo. The primary study hypothesis is that individuals receiving tocilizumab will 
show greater improvements in their PANSS total scores than those taking placebo. Secondary outcomes will 
include comparisons on specific clinical, cognitive, and biochemical (i.e., cytokines) outcomes, as well as 
relationships between baseline IL-[ADDRESS_375950] of the 
immunologic/inflammatory/infectious theory of SZ, and therefore has great implications for the study of 
drug development, etiology and pathophysiology of the illness.
Background, Significance and  Rationale
Background, Significance and Rationale
Birth
 cohort studies have identified associations between schizophrenia (SZ) and early pregnancy exposure 
to infectious agents, including influenza (Brown, Begg et al. 2004), herpes simplex virus type 2 (Buka, 
Tsuang et al. 2001; Buka, Cannon et al. 2008), and Toxoplasma gondii (Brown, Schaefer et al. 2005; 
Mortensen, Norgaard-Pedersen et al. 2007). The most parsimonious model suggests that there are common 
effects of infection that may increase the risk of SZ (Brown and Derkits 2010). These effects are 
hypothesized to be mediated by [CONTACT_167356] (Gilmore and Jarskog 1997). Cytokines are a family of soluble 
proteins that play an important role as the systemic mediators of host response to infection (Brown and 
Derkits 2010). Cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), may be produced in the CNS, have numerous 
effects on both glial and neuronal components of the CNS and have effects on both normal and abnormal 
brain development (Frei, Malipi[INVESTIGATOR_307101]. 1989; Benveniste, Sparacio et al. 1990; Hopkins and Rothwell

1995; Rothwell and Hopkins 1995; Gilmore and Jarskog 1997). In the maternal immune activation model of 
SZ, lipopolysaccharide- and poly (I:C) administration induce elevated levels of IL-6 in fetal brain (Patterson 
2009). IL-[ADDRESS_375951]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (effect size = 1.4) and acute relapsed 
(effect size = 0.96) patients, while they decrease after treatment (effect size = -0.31) (Miller, Buckley et al. 
2011). These data suggest that IL-6 is a state marker of SZ, normalizing with treatment.  In addition, 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies of the peripheral benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_32538], which is 
upregulated during microglial activation, have also supported persistent inflammation in the brains of 
individuals with SZ (van Berckel, Bossong et al. 2008; Doorduin, de Vries et al. 2009; Takano, Arakawa et 
al. 2010). Finally, treatment studies of non-specific anti-inflammatory agents also support the development 
of treatments aimed at underlying inflammation (Muller, Riedel et al. 2002; Akhondzadeh, Tabatabaee et al. 
2007; Laan, Grobbee et al. 2010; Muller, Krause et al. 2010). Therefore, pharmacologic agents that potently 
inhibit the activity of specific cytokines, in particular IL-6, represent a novel approach to the treatment of 
schizophrenia and may offer greater therapeutic benefit. 
Specific Aims  and Hypotheses
Specific Aims and Hypotheses
Study Goals:
1) Establish the  feasibility of using tocilizumab , and targeting the IL-6 receptor in general, as treatment for 
positive, negative and cognitive symptoms and impairments in daily functioning in SZ (i.e., as measured by 
[CONTACT_307119], GAF, CGI, UPSA, and MATRICS) and determine effect sizes for a more definitive clinical trial.
2) Refine  the study procedures and inclusion/exclusion criteria for a future, definitive clinical trial, using 
clinical/neuropsychological measures and laboratory analyses of cytokine levels.
3) To evaluate the safety of tocilizumab in schizophrenia.
 
4) To examine the effects of tocilizumab on hippocampal CBV and glutamate.
Description of Subject  Population
Sample #[ADDRESS_375952] to 
enroll 65% males and 35% females; with a racial profile of 44% Caucasian, 22% Hispanic, 26% African 
American, 6% Asian, and 2% Other.
Description of subject population
Patients with Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. All will undergo a screening history and physical, 
structured diagnostic interview, baseline laboratory work, and a urine drug screen. We will use the available 
information already obtained on subjects via clinical admission procedures or participation in other research 
protocols whenever possible.
Recruitment Procedures
Describe settings where recruitment will occur
Patients are  recruited from various sources by [CONTACT_307120] (CUMC) and from affiliated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (Harlem Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307102]. Luke’s-Roosevelt) and 
local mental health clinics, day programs, community residences, family and mental health advocacy 
groups.
We could  also recruit stable, English-speaking patients from outpatient clinics, from the Inwood or 
Audubon Clinics of the Washington Heights Community Service, or from the Lieber Research Clinic if they 
meet criteria for participation and are willing to participate. We could also recruit individuals who are 
inpatients on the 5-South inpatient unit at NYSPI, the 4-South inpatient unit at PI, or other inpatient units, 
if the patients meet criteria for the study, have capacity to make informed consent, and are interested in 
participating in this study.
In other  terms this study can be conducted on an inpatient or outpatient basis but recruitment could be 
from either the inpatient or the outpatient settings. The patient will be approached by a member of the 
clinical team for permission to be approached by [CONTACT_5051]. Capacity to provide informed consent 
will be evaluated by a psychiatrist not associated with the research team.

Baseline assessments
To obtain  a research diagnosis, we will use the SCID and/or DIGS information, in addition to history and 
clinical impression.  Additional information will be collected through the Positive and Negative Syndrome 
Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al., 1987), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale (Guy 1976), WTAR (WTAR 2001), 
Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) (APA, 2000), the University of [LOCATION_004] Performance-based Skills 
Assessment (UPSA) (Patterson et al., 2001) and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (Posner 
et al., 2007).
Clinical assessment
Clinical assessment  will be performed at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. At each time, PANSS, the CGI 
scale, the GAF, CSSRS, MATRICS, and UPSA will be performed.
Neuropsychological Test  Battery
The MATRICS  battery was chosen by a panel of experts on cognition in schizophrenia, and the battery is 
specifically designed to assess treatment-related changes in cognition in patients with schizophrenia. It 
assesses cognitive functions in the following domains using the following tests: Speed of Processing: 
Category Fluency, Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) – Symbol-Coding, Trail Making A. 
Attention/Vigilance: Continuous Performance Test – Identical Pairs (CPT-IP). Working Memory: University

Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) – Revised. Visual Learning: Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT) ¬– 
Revised. Reasoning and Problem Solving: Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) – Mazes. Social 
Cognition: Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT)– Managing Emotions.  This battery 
takes 60 to 90 minutes to administer.
Study Drug  administration
Protocol Summary Form

Girgis, Ragy
Page 16  of 31
At day  0, week 4 and week 8 subjects will receive study drug (placebo or tocilizumab) based on random 
assignment. Study drug will be administered intravenously via an iv drip over [ADDRESS_375956] suite, or the 5 South treatment room. A study 
physician will be present for the entire infusion.
All subjects  randomized to tocilizumab will receive 8mg/kg during their infusions, unless the subject is 
experiencing side effects that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_307105], are intolerable and likely 
to improve at a lower dose. In these cases 4mg/kg of tocilizumab, or the placebo equivalent, will be 
administered. Placebo will consist of a normal saline solution and will be administered in a similar manner. 
The maximum dose used will be 800mg.
Because of the  very low risk of anaphylaxis (see figure for criteria), as well as fever, chills, nausea, or 
vomiting due to the tocilizumab infusion itself (hypersensitivity reaction), the study physician will have 
parenteral epi[INVESTIGATOR_307106], as well as 
acetaminophen, and patients will be monitored by a study physician or nurse for one hour after the 
administration. Patients will also be called by [CONTACT_307124].
 
All patients will provide samples for anti-tocilizumab antibody testing at baseline and at termination.  In 
addition, samples for PK/PD will be tested for each time point when an anti-tocilizumab antibody test is 
done.  All patients experiencing events related to serious hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions that 
cause the patient to be withdrawn from study drug treatment will have anti-tocilizumab and PK/PD testing 
at time of event, and also [ADDRESS_375957] dose for anti-tocilizumab and PK/PD testing.   
Patients withdrawn from study drug due to a reduced neutrophil count will be monitored for signs of 
infection, with treatment as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_10157], and will have a repeat white blood cell 
count with differential performed weekly until the ANC is above 1500 cells/mm3 (1.5 x 109/L). If the ANC 
drops below 1.0 *10^9/L, biweekly CBCs will be performed and a heme consult will be obtained. In

Safety monitoring  and follow-up visits
Safety monitoring  will include the procedures described above in addition to a full evaluation including the 
following: a complete medical and psychiatric interview, medical exam, extrapyramidal symptoms, routine 
blood tests (25 mL) with LFTs and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_307107] 2, 4, 8, and 12. If clinically indicated, 
subjects may be asked to participate in extra follow-up visits as determined by [CONTACT_5989]. Vital 
signs urine toxicology, urine pregnancy, and adverse events via the SAFTEE will be assessed at every visit.
All patients who participate in this protocol will be managed by a study physician. If a subject who 
participates in this protocol has another psychiatrist before beginning the study, the study physician will 
coordinate care with that psychiatrist, although all patients will be seen for medical/psychiatric assessments 
at a minimum as per the schedule described above. 
 
Patients withdrawn from study drug due to a reduced neutrophil count will be monitored for signs of 
infection, with treatment as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_10157], and will have a repeat white blood cell 
count with differential performed weekly until the ANC is above 1000 cells/mm3 (1.0 x 109/L). If the ANC 
does not return to above 1000 cells/mm3 (1.0 x 109/L) within 2 months (or sooner if deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_307125]), a hematology referral will be obtained.
Patients withdrawn from study drug due to a reduced platelet count will have a repeat platelet count 
performed weekly until the count is above 100,000 cells/mm3 (100 x 109/L). If the platelets do not return to 
above 100,000 cells/mm3 (100 x 109/L) within 2 months (or sooner if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_307126]), a hematology referral will be obtained.
Patients withdrawn from study drug due to elevated liver function tests will have repeat tests performed, as 
clinically appropriate, until levels return to baseline.  If the patient’s liver function tests have not returned to 
baseline within 6 months (or sooner, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_36613]), an ultrasound and/or 
liver biopsy will be considered.
Early Termination  Visits
In the  case that patients must terminate the study early, every effort will be made to obtain the next 
scheduled clinical/neuropsychological/safety assessments as soon as possible after early termination, as 
well as the next study drug administration if it has been at least [ADDRESS_375958] administration and 
continue through the protocol, if possible and if they are willing to do so, as per the regular schedule.

Patients who participate in this  protocol may be asked to consider having a clinical/neuropsychological 
rating session associated with this study audio or videotaped, and would sign a separate consent for this. 
These audio/videotapes will be used only for educational/training purposes. Any patient who declines will 
still be eligible to participate in all other components of this study. Audio/video tapes will be kept for up to 
ten 10 years. They will be kept in locked file cabinets, and available only to research staff.
Cytokine and Toxoplasma Levels
At the  baseline and week 4, 8, and 12 visits, blood will be obtained for cytokine levels and toxoplasma 
antibody.
MRI Option
 
Patients who meet the additional MRI exclusion criteria and are interested will be presented the optoin of 
participating in the MRI option. Of note, participating in the MRI option is not required to be a part of the 
clinical trial. This will be clearly stated to patients.
 
For this option, patients will receive an MRI scan (as detailed below) at baseline and within one month of 
receiving their last dose of study drug. If they terminate early and after receiving at least one dose of study 
drug, they will be asked to have their follow up MRI scan.
 
MRI with gadolinium contrast. Subjects will obtain MRI images on the NYSPI 3.0T GE scanner. CBV, 
ASL, and MRS sequences will be obtained. After a T1 scout image, needed to determine patient position, 
we will acquire the following images:
(1) Standard structural images will be used to obtain tissue content information needed to convert the ASL 
signal into CBF value in physiological units. Next, pseudo Continuous ASL (pCASL) images will be 
acquired. Total imaging time for ASL will be ~10mins.
(2) For acquisition of left hippocampal glutamate using MRS, we will use standard MRS sequences. Total 
imaging time for MRS will be 15~30min.
(3) For CBV mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], subjects will receive pre-gadolinium and post-gadolinium T-1 weighted images after 
receiving I.V. gadolinium (0.1mmol/kg). Total imaging time for CBV will be ~[ADDRESS_375959] and care setting will be immediately arranged for further diagnostic

Because of the FDA safety announcement, we will inform all subjects who are currently enrolled, 
about this new safety announcement. We will use the following template to begin the discussion:
 
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an announcement stating they are 
investigating a possible risk of adverse health effects from repeated use of gadolinium for MRI. 
Though the FDA has not reached a conclusion at this time, you should not participate in this study if 
you have previously had more than 1 MRI scan with gadolinium."
 
From this point we will have a discussion with the subject about his/her willingness to continue to 
participate. If they do not want to continue their participation, they will be discontinued from the 
study.
 
In addition, to ensure that individuals are systematically queried about previous gadolinium scans, we 
will ask all individuals who are currently enrolled or interested in the study whether they had an MRI 
with an i.v. injection (i.e., “Did they give you an injection?”) in case people do not know the term 
“gadolinium.”

Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences 
Risks that could be encountered during the study period
a. Tocilizumab  administration
Tocilizumab is  FDA-approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in individuals who have not 
responded to previous DMARD therapy, as well as for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Therefore, there is 
substantial information on tocilizumab use, and tocilizumab has been found to be generally well tolerated, 
and its risks well characterized. We would also like to clarify that individuals who have received 
tocilizumab in clinical studies or in practice are generally more medically infirm (tocilizumab is indicated 
only for adults who have failed another biologic agent) and often receiving another immune modulator, such 
as methotrexate. Therefore, their risks of side effects are generally much higher than for our subjects who 
will be medically healthy and only receiving tocilizumab. A substantial proportion of serious side effects 
that occur while taking tocilizumab occur in individuals who are already immunocompromised, have CHF, 
or are predisposed or already have cancer.
There are  several risks of tocilizumab use. Risks of the administration include anaphylaxis (0.4%) as well as 
an acute hypersensitivity reaction (0.2%) including chills, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The emergence of 
anti-tocilizumab antibodies has been reported in clinical studies (RA: 18 of 601 patients (3.0 %), pJIA: 1 of 
19 patients (5.3 %), sJIA: 11 of 128 patients (8.6 %); and Castleman’s disease: 1 of 35 patients (2.9%).
Common and  mild side effects of tocilizumab administration including mild infection including 
nasopharyngitis, hypertension, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, mild elevated AST/ALT, headache, and 
dizziness, elevated lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. More serious side effects including injection site reaction (5-8%), gastrointestinal 
perforation (rare), thrombocytopenia (1.3-1.7%), neutropenia (1.8-3.4%), tuberculosis (rare), upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (6-8%), cancer (rare, and does not separate from placebo, Lopez-Olivo et al., 
2012), other serious/opportunistic infection (rare), demyelinating disorders (rare, unclear if related to 
tocilizumab), pleurisy (rare), cardiac failure (rare; and in meta-analyses with other immune modulators, 
does not separate from placebo (Singh et al., 2011).
Tocilizumab should  not be administered to pregnant or nursing females.
We will also break the blind after [ADDRESS_375963] been known to inhibit CYP450 enzymes, with a preference for those NOT 
involved in the metabolism of antipsychotic medications (e.g., CYP3A4). Treatment with tocilizumab has 
been known to restore CYP450 functioning to normal levels in situations in which elevated IL-[ADDRESS_375964] psychiatric

medications are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]450 enzymes NOT affected by [CONTACT_8668]-6 to a great degree (e.g., CYP2D6), 
although some are metabolized to a minor degree by [CONTACT_097]450 enzymes affected by [CONTACT_8668]-6 (e.g., CYP3A4). 
Therefore, while we do not expect a change in antipsychotic blood levels during the course of this trial, we 
will be vigilant about monitoring for a change in mental status of all participants in this trial. 
 
There is also the possibility that patients will experience an exacerbation of symptoms while in this trial.
b. Venous  Blood sampling
Intra-venous sampling  or lines (heplock or IV) can cause bleeding, occlusion, infection, or clotting. They 
may also cause discomfort.
c. Interviews
Patients may experience boredom  and fatigue during the administration of neuropsychological 
assessments and ratings scales.
d. Audio/videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_307110]  a slight risk of loss of confidentiality to subjects who participate in this optional component of the 
protocol.
e. MRI Imaging: The Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves 
to take measurements in the brain. MRI involves lying on a table that slides into a large magnet 
shaped like a cylinder. Before beginning the procedure, we will determine that patients do not have a 
pacemaker or any unsafe metallic implants such as an aneurysm clip or heart valve and certain 
tattoos, and they will be asked to remove any metal or magnetized objects (such as keys, chains, 
jewelry, retainers, medication patches, hairpi[INVESTIGATOR_307111]). In addition, they will complete a 
brief interview at the time of study inclusion to determine if they have Asthma or a history of renal 
failure that may exclude their ability to receive an injection of Gadolinium (see below section). These 
questions will be repeated on the day of the scan. For the scanning procedure, they will be asked to lie 
flat on the back in the MRI scanner for
approximately [ADDRESS_375965] reported sensations 
during MRI scans, such as "tingling" or "twitching" (or, very rarely, a painful sensation), which are 
caused by [CONTACT_307129]. With any MRI scan, on 
occasion, some people experience nervousness or discomfort due to the scanner's small space and the 
need to lie still. Except for pacemakers, some types of metallic implants, and medication patches, we 
are not aware of any other potentially dangerous interactions or hazards associated with the MRI 
scan. The MRI scanner also produces a loud noise.
 
f. Gadolinium compounds do have side effects such as nausea and vomiting, observed in less than 2 
people out of every 100 injected. (1.8% estimate). Dry mouth (less than 2%), dizziness (0.7% up to 
3.6%), and headache (2.2% up to 5.8%) are infrequent, yet possible side-effects. An additional side 
effect is hives, observed in less than 1 person out of every 100 injected with Multihance (0.7% 
estimate). All of these side effects resolve within [ADDRESS_375966] agents are at increased risk for more serious side rare side effects (less
than 1/10,000 injections estimate), such as severe allergic reaction that may result in sudden difficulty 
breathing, and therefore will not be injected with Gadolinium. Some patients with acute renal failure 
or end-stage renal disease have developed a serious medical condition known as nephrogenic systemic 
fibrosis (NSF) after the use of gadolinium for MRI. The primary concern regarding risks to renal 
function from gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) is specific to this population of patients 
who have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, or acute, florid, clinical renal failure, and 
then are exposed to gadolinium. This population of patients is by [CONTACT_307130]. Renal dysfunction as a result of 
gadolinium in a population without history of end-stage renal disease or acute renal failure has not 
been described in the medical literature. In a retrospective study conducted at two large medical 
centers, 74,[ADDRESS_375967] dose of gadolinium (0.1mmol/kg, the same dose used in our research studies) 
who had no screening for renal function, with a rate of zero/74,124 cases of renal complications (e.g., 
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) or other renal dysfunction) post injection (Prince, Zhang et al. 
2008). All [ADDRESS_375968] been identified in persons with 
normal renal function or with moderate renal dysfunction.
 
Regarding this specific risk, the FDA recommends:
1. Become familiar with the patient populations at risk for NSF.
2. Avoid using gadolinium in patients with known risks for developi[INVESTIGATOR_248526].
3. Prior to administering gadolinium, evaluate patients for renal dysfunction by [CONTACT_307131], either by [CONTACT_19201] a medical history or conducting laboratory tests that measure renal 
function.
4. When administering gadolinium, do not exceed the recommended dose in product labeling and 
allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the agent from the body prior to any further 
gadolinium
administration.
 
The American College of Radiology recommends, as of July 2007, pre-screening patients prior to the 
administration
 of Gadolinium-Based MR Contrast Agents (GBMCA) their glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) for the following patient groups:
1. Renal disease (including solitary kidney, renal transplant, renal tumor)
2. Age >60
3. History of Hypertension
4. History of Diabetes
5. History of severe hepatic disease/liver transplant/pending liver transplant. For patients in this 
category only, it is recommended that the patient's GFR assessment be nearly contemporaneous with 
the MR examination for which the GBMCA is to be administered.
 
The dosing guidelines are as follows: CNS (Central Nervous System) Adults: The recommended dose 
of Multihance 0.1mmol/kg (0.2 mL/kg) administered as a rapid bolus intravenous injection. 
According to the Multihance package insert and the recent literature, repeated dosing of mutihance 
up to a total dose of .3mmol/kg (in three doses of 0.1mmol/kg) can be immediate given within a short

time-span with no adverse effects. The elimination half-life of the compound is 1-2 hours. Prior to 
readministration, the FDA recommends 'sufficient time for drug elimination'. Our study design of a 
single baseline dose at 0.1mmol/kg followed by [CONTACT_307132], which should be complete by [CONTACT_307133], and is well below the maximal dosing 
guidelines that have been shown to be safe with repeated dosing in prior studies. 
Describe procedures for minimizing risks
All subjects  are given contact [CONTACT_71722] [INVESTIGATOR_83619] (primarily [CONTACT_307141]) so that they 
can contact [CONTACT_307134].
a. In  order to minimize risk, each patient will be monitored and the drug infusion stopped immediately 
should there be any safety concern. We will obtain frequent laboratory analyses, including lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], liver 
tests, and cbc, adverse event queries, and EKGs during this study.  Patients will be terminated from the 
study if their LFTs (i.e., AST/ALT) rise above 3x ULN or the ANC below 1000 or platelet count <100,000, or 
they develop side effects that are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], preclusive of continuing in this protocol. 
Patients with baseline severe liver disease, elevated AST/ALT (1.5x ULN), ANC<1500, thrombocytopenia 
(platelet < 100,000), known intestinal diverticula or an immunologic disorder which impairs the immune 
system will be excluded from this study. Patients will be instructed not to obtain any live vaccines between 
[ADDRESS_375969] (often 
methotrexate or prednisone which are comparatively more toxic). Therefore, all of the side effects that we 
will be discussing here are likely to occur at lesser rates and with lesser severity than described. In addition, 
tocilizumab is widely approved and it is now not possible to quantify the number of people who have 
received it. In addition, while the maximum dose in this trial is 8mg/kg given every 4 weeks, 12mg/kg is 
routinely given every [ADDRESS_375970]/ALT of 1.5xULN.

We will now address each of these criterion individually.
 
Regarding platelet counts, the mechanism by [CONTACT_307135], however, elevated IL-6 levels are thought to stimulate thrombopoietin (Kaser et al., 2001), so 
blocking IL-6 with tocilizumab may mitigate this activity. However, tocilizumab is not a bone marrow 
suppressor and only potentiates thrombopoietin. Therefore, antagonizing IL-6 only leads to a minor 
decrease in platelet counts, if at all, and one that is not related to serious bleeding events and rarely 
decreases below 100K. The frequency of this event is 1-4% in individuals receiving both tocilizumab and 
another DMARD, while in this trial subjects will only be receiving tocilizumab, which is relatively mild 
compared to typi[INVESTIGATOR_307112] (e.g., methotrexate, prednisone). In addition, tocilizumab related decreases 
in platelet counts are not related to serious bleeding events and are readily reversibly after discontinuing 
treatment. In summary, tocilizumab related thrombocytopenia is an extremely uncommon event, is mild 
when it occurs, is fully reversible after discontinuing treatment, and has no substantial clinical relevance.
 
Regarding decreases in neutrophil counts, the mechanism by [CONTACT_307136]. However, it is thought that IL-6 demarginates neutrophils and accelerates their release from 
marrow (Suwa et al., 2000), so blocking IL-6 would mitigate these effects. In addition, recent data show 
that anti IL6 treatments (such as tocilizumab) do not cause phagocytosis or reduced functioning of 
neutrophils (Wright et al., 2014), confirming these data.  Additionally, clinical data from Genentech 
(attached) also show that while Tocilizumab dose decrease ANC, the decrease in ANC has not been 
associated with severe infection. Also, tocilizumab is not a bone marrow suppressor and does not affect the 
overall concentration of neutrophils. Therefore, antagonizing IL-[ADDRESS_375971] approximately 33% of 
individuals on tocilizumab (~6 in this trial) to reach up to 3xULN and one percent to reach between 3-5x 
ULN (~0-1 in this trial). However, tocilizumab is not overtly toxic to the liver, and hepatitis or fulminant 
liver failure are not considered risks of tocilizumab. When it occurs, transaminitis is mild, reversible, and 
has no clinical relevance. In summary, tocilizumab related transaminitis is a relatively common event 
though much less common above 3xULN, is mild when it occurs, is fully reversible after discontinuing 
treatment, and has no substantial clinical relevance.

Because of the  very low risk of anaphylaxis, as well as fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting due to the 
tocilizumab infusion itself (hypersensitivity reaction), the study physician will have parenteral epi[INVESTIGATOR_307113], as well as acetaminophen, and patients will be 
monitored by a study physician or nurse (at the bedside) for one hour after the administration. For the one 
hour time period after the administration, when a nurse is at the bedside of the patient, the study 
physician will be in the immediate proximity (i.e., on [ADDRESS_375972] suite, and in the Division of Translational Imaging if using the Division of Translational 
Imaging, so that, if necessary, the study physician can be at the bedside within 30 seconds). During the one 
hour infusion, the study physician will be present at all times.  Patients will also be called by [CONTACT_307137]. 
In addition, while we do not expect a change in antipsychotic blood levels during the course of this trial, we 
will be vigilant about monitoring for a change in mental status of all participants in this trial.  
b. These  risks are minimized by [CONTACT_307138]. In addition, the primary study physician (in most 
cases [CONTACT_307141]) will assess the IV catheter placement. IV catheters will be removed immediately after 
administration of the study drug is complete (approximately 1 hour after placement).
c. In  order to avoid boredom caused by [CONTACT_307139], 
patients will be allowed frequent and regular breaks. If necessary, particularly during the 
screening/baseline visit, patients will be allowed to finish the session on a different day.
d. In  order to minimize the risks of loss of confidentiality for those patients who participate in the optional 
audio/videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_307114], tapes will be kept in locked drawers, and made available to 
research staff only. Personal identifying information will not be included on the tapes.
 
e. MRI Imaging: Before beginning the procedure, we will determine that patients do not have a 
pacemaker or any unsafe metallic implants such as an aneurysm clip or heart valve and certain 
tattoos, and they will be asked to remove any metal or magnetized objects (such as keys, chains, 
jewelry, retainers, medication patches, hairpi[INVESTIGATOR_307111]). In addition, they will complete a 
brief interview at the time of study inclusion to determine if they have Asthma or a history of renal 
failure that may exclude their ability to receive an injection of Gadolinium (see below section). These 
questions will be repeated on the day of the scan. The MRI scanner also produces a loud noise; 
earplugs will be provided to reduce this discomfort. If a patient experience any discomfort and wish 
to stop the scan, he/she can tell the MRI technologist who will stop the scan immediately. In our 
experience, no one has had sensations from the MRI that did not stop when the scanning stopped. 
 
f. Gadolinium -A trained physician  (currently [CONTACT_307141]) will inject the gadolinium and remain with 
the patient for the entire duration and for 15minutes after the scanning session is complete. Prior to 
scan, all participants being considered for participation in this study will continue to have a complete 
medical history prior to MRI to screen for renal failure/history of renal disease, diabetes, or 
hypertension, as well as screening labs. Patients with a diagnosis of acute renal failure are invariably 
severely medically ill and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], and are not eligible for study participation. In the current 
protocol, we administer Multihance according to the patient's weight at a dose of 0.1mmol/kg. Based

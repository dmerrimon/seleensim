 INTRODUCTION 
The global incidence of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection peaked in the mid -
1990s.  The incidence of new infections in 2014 is reported by [CONTACT_125539]/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) as 2 million new cases,  a reduction of 35% since 2000, with an estimated  
global total of 36.9 million people living with HIV  [1].  The decrease in  HIV incidence, due to 
multiple factors including prevention and treatment  programs , is an encouraging trend  but the scope 
and cost of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_128143] a global health threat .  
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is committed to the development of safe, effective methods to prevent and treat HIV and AIDS worldwide.  In this regard, the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), NIAID and Division of AIDS (DAIDS), NIAID, are collaborating to evaluate the potential clinical uses of HIV -specific 
broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (MAb) [ 2-4].  
The VRC, NIAID, NIH has  developed VRC07-523LS, a highly potent and broadly neutralizing 
HIV-[ADDRESS_144482] the HIV-1 CD4 binding site.  A similar antibody,  VRC01 
MAb, is currently in clinical trials under IND 113,611 [prevention indication] and IND 126,001 and 
IND 126,664 [therapeutic indication], was originally discovered in a subject infected with HIV-1 
for more than 15 years and whose immune system controlled the virus without anti- retroviral 
therapy [5]. Through advances in B-cell immunology, cloning and structure-guided optimization 
techniques, numerous HIV-1 neutralizing MAbs, including VRC07 (“07” denotes sequential numbering when discovered), VRC07-523 (“523” denotes sequential number ing when engineered 
variant generated), and later VRC07 -523LS (“LS” denotes 2 amino acid mutations), were isolated 
with potency and breadth greater than those of early antibodies[ 3]. 
The VRC07 (wild-type) heavy chain was identified by 454 deep sequencing based on its similarity to the VRC01 MAb and paired with the VRC01 (wild- type) light chain.  The mutations that together 
define the [ADDRESS_144483] amino acid residue of the light chain.   The LS designation specifies 
methionine to leucine (L) and asparagine to serine (S) (M428L/N434S, referred to as LS) changes 
within the C -terminus of the heavy chain constant region.  The LS mutation was introduced by [CONTACT_3725]-
directed mutagenesis to increase the binding affinity for the neonatal Fc -receptor (FcRn), resulting 
in increased recirculation of functional IgG [ 6, 7], thus increasing plasma half -life.   
VRC -HIVMAB0 75-00- AB (VRC07 -523LS ) is an investigational drug th at has not been 
administered to humans prior to this study. VRC07 -523LS is intended for the prevention of HIV-1 
infection in healthy adults initially . VRC07 -523LS may  also be evaluated for prevention of mother-
to-child transmission  and for treatment of  HIV -1 infected subjects. 
 RATIONALE FOR THE  STUDY  
VRC ’s clinical development  plans for neutralizing MAbs include potential uses in thr ee broad 
areas: 1) prevention of mother- to-child t ransmission (MTCT)  of HIV, 2) prevention of sexual 
transmission  of HIV , and 3) therapeutic application in HIV -[ADDRESS_144484] of HIV .  To evaluate the safety of administering VRC01  to infants who may be HI V-
infected at birth, studies in infants were preceded by [CONTACT_7609] 1 trials  in HIV -infected adults  (VRC 
601) and HIV -uninfected adults (VRC 602) that began in [ADDRESS_144485]: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0  
 PROTOCOL DATE: OCTOB ER 11, 2017    
Page 9 of 62 VRC01  has been  assessed as  safe and well tolerated at  the 5 -40 mg/kg doses administered 
intravenously (IV) and at 5 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) in both HIV -infected and HIV- uninfected 
adult populations.  T he pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of passively administered VRC01 were 
also evaluated.   For healthy adults  who received VRC01 at the 5 -40 mg/kg doses administered IV  
(n=18), the clearance was 0.016±0.003 L/h and an overall mean value for t he elimination half -life 
was 15.4±3.9 day s for IV administration .  At 5 mg/kg SC (n=5), the clearance was 0.029±0.007 L/h, 
and the mean elimination half -life was  16.6 ± 2.[ADDRESS_144486] as VRC01, neutralizes more HIV envelope strains than VRC01 at lower concentrations.   
VRC07 -523LS was found to be 5-to 8-fold more potent than VRC01, with an inhibitory 
concentration IC 50 <50 mcg/mL against 96% of HIV-1 pseudoviruses representing the major 
circulating HIV -1 clades and IC 50 <1 mcg/mL against 92% of HIV-[ADDRESS_144487] a prolonged half- life over 
VRC07 by [CONTACT_2902] 2- fold [3].   
In vivo  proof-of-concept studies showed that VRC07-523LS is about 5-fold more potent than 
VRC01LS in Rhesus macaques and displays a longer half- life (9 .8 days) than VRC07 (4.9 days) 
after a single dose of MAb at 10 mg/kg administered IV [ 3]. 
When administered IV at a single dose of 10 mg/kg in cynomolgus macaques, the half- life of 
VRC07 -523LS was about [ADDRESS_144488] 28 days (last collection point) in rectal and 
vaginal secretions and tissues. When administered SC at a single dose of 10 mg/kg in rhesus 
macaques, the half -life of VRC07-523LS was about [ADDRESS_144489] 49 days (last 
collection point) in rectal, vaginal and nasal secretions. Complete protection from SHIV-SF162P3 challenge was demonstrated with a single dose of VRC07-523LS at 20 mg/kg administered IV.   
A repeat dose IV and SC toxicity study with VRC07-523LS was performed in male and female 
Sprague -Dawley rats in accordance with “Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for Nonclinical 
Laboratory Studies.”  Treatment with  VRC07 -523LS at doses up to 400 mg/kg/dose IV or 40 
mg/kg/dose SC with three doses at [ADDRESS_144490] findings 
were reversible and no longer seen at the end of the recovery period.  Additionally, histologic changes were not observed in the GLP repeat dose toxicology study in the cell types with staining 
observed in the GLP tissue cross reactivity (TCR) study.  
Increased neutralization potency in vitro  and prolonged half- life of VRC07 -523LS correlate with 
improved protection against SHIV infection in vivo in animal studies , suggesting a potential clinical 
application against HIV -1 infection in humans in preventive and/or therapeutic settings. 
The proposed VRC07 -523LS doses are based on human studies of VRC01, preclinical studies of 
VRC07 -523LS and  the requirements to assess PK at a range of doses that will allow for full PK 
analysis and predictive modeling.  This range of doses allow s for informative PK modeling to be 
performed with the study data obtained here.  Preclinical studies with VRC07 -523LS to date also 
support the proposed human dose s and intervals between doses to achieve passive immunity as 
described in Section 2 and in the Investigator’s Brochur e (IB) .

VRC07 -523LS concentration for the PK analysis in this Phase 1 study will be measured by [CONTACT_128159] a Beckman Biomek based automation platform. The monoclonal antibody 5C9 is coated 
onto Immulon-4HXB microtiter plates overnight a t 4° C at a concentration of 3.5 mg/mL.  Plates 
are washed and blocked (10% FBS in PBS) for [ADDRESS_144492] sample are incubated 2 hours at 37° C 
followed by [CONTACT_128160] - labeled goat anti -human antibody (1hour, 37° C), and TMB 
substrate (15 minutes, room temperature).  Color development is stopped by [CONTACT_128161] [ADDRESS_144493] curve of VRC07-523LS covering the 
range from 0.98 to 1000 ng/mL is utilized to quantitate the sample concentrations based upon the average of sample dilutions within the range of the assay. 
Assessment for development of anti- VRC07 -523LS antibodies in subjects will be performed using 
the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform based on electrochemiluminescence.  The developed 
ADA assay uses the biotin- labeled VRC0 7 immobilized  on a streptavidin- coated MSD plate as the 
capture molecule, and the SULFO -TAG labeled VRC0 7 as the reporter molecule.  This assay is 
independent of the anti- VRC0 7-523LS antibody isotype, and permits the detection of both high and 
low affinity antibodies. Evaluation for anti- VRC0 7-523LS antibodies will be conducted in batches, 
on samples collected at 4 weeks after each antibody administration. Samples collected at other visits 
could be tested if there is a clinical indication or a decrease in PK values observed. 
Depending upon the concentrations measured in collected specimens, further evaluation of the 
research samples to assess for functional capacity to neutralize HIV may be conducted by [CONTACT_128162]-based virus neutralization assay using the pseudotyped viruses [ 8-10]. 
As an exploratory evaluation, subjects may be evaluated for their IgG1 allotypes to determine the potential for theoretical allotype -specific effects on the VRC07 -523LS pharmacokinetics such as 
reduced half -life or anti- drug antibody response [ 11-13].  Coded stored samples will be used for 
evaluation of the genetic sequence of the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region allotype .

 PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  STUDY 
A repeat dose IV and SC toxicity and pharmacokinetic study of clinical -grade VRC -HIVMAB075-
00-AB ( VRC07 -523LS) in male and female Sprague- Dawley rats was performed by [CONTACT_128165], 
Chicago, IL in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations.  Treatment with VRC -
HIVMAB075-00- AB (VRC07 -523LS), at doses up to 400 mg/kg/dose IV or 40 mg/kg/dose SC 
with three doses at 10- day intervals, was well -tolerated as most findings were reversible and no 
longer seen at the end of the recovery period.  Refer to the IB  for more information about this study. 
 IN VITRO  SAFETY STUDIES

Study Purpose  Study Outcome  
Assessment of anti -phospholipid 
reactivity  VRC07 -523LS has slight reactivity to phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] [ 3] 
Assessment of anti -nuclear 
antigen reactivity  VRC07 -523LS does reacts with a small subset of nuclear 
antigens  
Assessment of anti -phospholipid 
characteristics by [CONTACT_128166] (aPTT)  VRC07 -523LS does not impact aPTT by [CONTACT_128167][INVESTIGATOR_128145] a

Assessment of potential “off 
target” binding in a GLP t issue 
cross -reactivity study with 
normal adult human and ra t 
(Sprague Dawley) tissues  VRC07 -523LS staining that was observed in both human 
and Sprague- Dawley rat tissues included cytoplasm, 
cytoplasmic granules, perinuclear, and/or api[INVESTIGATOR_128146], epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], spi[INVESTIGATOR_86858], mononuclear 
cells, granulosa lutein cells, and neural cell processes.  VRC07 -523LS staining that was observed in human tissues 
only included cytoplasmic elements of hematopoietic cells, 
cells/processes associated with peripheral nerve, glial cell 
processes, reticular cells, mesothelial cells, interstitial cells, 
and adipocytes, and extracellular proteinaceous material in 
connective tissue of the sclera.  VRC07 -523LS staining that 
was observed in rat tissues only included the cytoplasm of 
rare decidual cells and lens protein.  According to ICH 
S6(R1) and other references [
17, 18], monoclonal antibody 
binding to cytoplasmic sites generally is considered of little 
to no toxicologi c significance.  The specific staining of 
extracellular proteinaceous material in eye (human tissue) 
and staining for lens protein in eye (rat tissue) further 
support the rat as a relevant species to assess safety . 
Additionally, histologic changes were not observed in the 
GLP repeat dose toxicology study in the cell types with 
staining observed in the GLP TCR  study.

enrolled.  
4.2.2 Enrollment, Study Day s and Visit Numbers  
In this study, enrollment is defined as the assignment of a study identification number and study group schedule (Section 6.3.1) in the clinical database .  A clinician will discuss the target dates and  
timin g of the study product administration (s) and  sample collection s before completing an 
enrollment to help ensure that the subject can comply with the projected schedule.  
Day [ADDRESS_144515] VRC07 -523LS administration.   Day 0 may occur on the same 
day as enrollment or up to 6 weeks after.  This period may be increased with PI [INVESTIGATOR_41473].  If Day 0 
does not coincide with enrollment, then the enrollment day may be referred to by a negative number 
of days (i.e., Day -1 to Day -42).  For c alculating elapsed days  following Day 0, each subsequent 
calendar date is labeled by [CONTACT_125557] “Study Day” as shown in the Schedule of Evaluations, Appendix III.  Since there may be more than one research sampling timepoint of 
interest per study day, each sample collection timepoint has its own “Visit Number.”  For this reason, there may be more than one visit number recorded on the same calendar date.  
Medical history and Day [ADDRESS_144516] administration , temperature, 
blood pressure, heart rate ( pulse) and weight will be collected  and a targeted physical examination 
(based on signs, reported symptoms or interim medical history ) may be conducted .  In all study 
groups, the subject will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_144517] is assigned to an IV administration group, t he IV access  will be placed in an  arm vein in 
an aseptic manner .  A different site may  be used for collection of PK blood samples;  however, the 
same site  may be used after flushing the line if another site is not available .  VRC07 -523LS will be 
administered with  approximately [ADDRESS_144518] is  assigned to a SC administration group, the SC administration site(s) to be used will be 
discussed with the subject and mu st be assessed as acceptable by [CONTACT_52613] .  The 
preferred SC administration site is the abdomen , but the upper arm or thigh may b e used .  Given the 
weight criterion in this study, the maximum volume needed to administer a 5 mg/kg SC dose is not expected to exceed 5. [ADDRESS_144519]: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0  
 PROTOCOL DATE: OCTOB ER 11, [ADDRESS_144520]’s electronic record 
will be available to clinicians in real time, and will be the sour ce for these data.  If concerns arise 
based on the electronic data, or if a subject uses a paper diary card, clinicians may follow up with 
additional phone calls during reactogenicity period as needed.  The paper diary may be the source document, if used by [CONTACT_423].  When neither a written nor electronic diary is available from the subject, the clinician will note the source of reactogenicity information recorded in the study database.  
For this study, solicited systemic parameters  occurring during the [ADDRESS_144521] will include: unusually tired/feeling unwell, muscles aches, headache, chills, nausea and joint pain. Subjects will also record highest m easured temperature daily.  Subject diaries  are 
reviewed for accuracy and completeness at follow -up visits and reactogenicity is  recorded without 
an attribution assessment.  Clinicians will follow and collect resolution information for any 
reactogenicity symptoms that are not resolved within 3 days. 
Local symptoms will be assessed and recorded by [CONTACT_47656].  Local reactogenicity parameters 
will include pain/tenderness, swelling, redness, bruising, and pruritus (itchiness)  at the product 
administration  site. Clinicians will assess t he product administration site (s) for local reactogenicity 
on the day of product administration  and during the scheduled follow-up timepoints  for all g roups.   
Events that may  require a clinic visit include rash, urticaria, fever of 38.6˚C (Grade 2) or higher 
lasting greater than 24 hours or significant impairment in the activities of daily living  (such as those 
consistent with Grade 2 or higher impairment) . Additionally, arthralgia or other clinical concerns 
may prompt a study visit based on the judgment of a study clinician.  
Clinical laboratory assays and clinical evaluations will assess safety and tolerability at specified 
intervals  after each administration .  Throughout the study, clinicians will also assess subjects for 
any changes in symptoms to include vision changes.  Any new or concerning symptoms will be 
fully assessed to include specialty consultation at the NIH Clinical Center as indicated clinically.  
4.2.5 Pharmacokinetics  
PK samples will be collected as close as reasonably possible to the target timepoints.  However, 
actual time of collection is critical for PK analysis and will be recorded for all samples.   The PK 
timepoints are  shown in the Schedule of Ev aluations . 
4.2.6 Oral Mucosa Samples  
To understand tissue distribution of VRC 07-523 LS and how long after administration it may be 
detectable, this protocol includes exploratory collection of oral mucosa samples . Subjects  will be 
offered the option of participating in the  oral sampling schedule, but it will not be mandatory.  
Samples will be collected using small ophthalmic sponges designed for clinical use.   
Oral swabs  for research may be collected per the Schedule of Evaluations, Appendix III.  
4.2.7 Schedule of Evaluations  
The Schedule of Evaluations, Appendix III, provides details on the study schedule and the permitted 
visit windows.  Schedule 1 is for the IV dose escalation  groups receiving one injection  (Groups 1, 2, 
4, and 5),  Schedule 2 is for the SC dose group receiving one injection (Group 3).   Schedule 3 and 
Schedule 4 are for the groups receiving repeat dosing ; Group 6 (5 mg/kg SC ) and Group 7 (20 
mg/kg  IV).  The schedules also include instructions for evaluations of s ubjects  who discontinue

safety or for sample collection for immunological testing .  After study completion, subjects may be 
invited to participate in one of the VRC sample collection protocols (VRC 200 or VRC 900) for 
follow-up sample collection. 
Any evaluation for an AE  or possible exacerbation of a pre-existing condition may be evaluated at 
study team discretion as a “protocol related” evaluation.  
4.2.8 Concomitant Medications 
Only routine prescription medications will be entered in the dat abase at the time of enrollment.  
Subsequently, c oncomitant medications associated with an AE that requires expedited reporting or 
the development of a new chronic condition requiring ongoing medical management will be 
recorded  in the database.  Receipt of a FDA -approved vaccine at any time during the study will be 
recorded in the database (clinicians should work with subjects regarding the timing of licensed vaccines relative to study product administration).  Otherwise,  concomitant medications taken 
throughout the study will be recorded in the subject’s chart as needed for general medical documentation but will not be recorded in the database.   
 CRITERIA FOR DOSE AND ROUTE ESCALATION  
There are three dose escalation reviews in this study and one route escalation review .  The Pro tocol 
Safety Review Team (PSRT, Section 8.9) will conduct an interim safety data review before dose 
escalation  and repeat dosing may occur.  Th e PSRT  must assess the data as showing no significant 
safety concerns before proceeding with  enrollment  of the next groups.  
• The f irst dose escalation review  (from 1 mg/kg IV to 5 mg/kg  IV) will occur when at least  3 
subjects who received the 1 mg/kg IV dose have completed 2 week s of safety follow -up 
visits .  The PSRT  review will determine if enrollments in Group 2 may begin . 
• The only route  escalation review and the second dose escalation review (from 5 mg/kg IV to 
5 mg/kg  SC and 20 mg/kg IV , respectively ) will occur when at least  3 subjects who received  
the 5 mg/kg  IV dose have completed 2 week s of safety follow -up visits.  Th e PSRT  review 
will determine  if enrollments in Group 3 (5 mg/kg SC), Group 6 (5 mg/kg SC by [CONTACT_128173]), Group 4 (20 mg/kg IV) and Group 7 (20 mg/kg IV by [CONTACT_128174]) may begin.   
• The third  dose escalation review (from 20 mg/kg IV to 40 mg/kg IV) will occur when at 
least 3 subjects who received  the 20 mg/kg IV dose have completed 2 weeks of safety 
follow-up visits.  This review will determine if enrollments in Group 5 (40 mg/kg  IV) may 
begin.  
• Additionally, the second and third doses can be administered in Groups [ADDRESS_144523]: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0

Page 22 of 62 The IRB will be provided with documentation of the safety review process and notification of the 
dose escalation.  Consultation with the IRB and FDA, if needed, as per study pause criteria (Section 
4.5) will occur if indicated by [CONTACT_33828].   One outcome of a dose escalation review may be to 
recommend evaluation of additional subjects at the current dose and reassess for safety before proceeding to a higher dose.  
 CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUATION OF VRC0 7-523LS  ADMINI STRATION  
Under certain circumstances, a subject may be terminated from participating in study product 
administrations .  Subjects who receive at least one VRC0 7-523 LS administra tion will continue 
follow-up according to the protocol Schedule of Evaluations , except that  the research sample 
collections will be discontinued for pregnant women or others in which it is contraindicated.  The 
study team will notify the antiretroviral pregnanc y registry ( http://www.apregistry.com) of any 
pregnancies that occur after receiving VRC0 7-523LS  for any subject still on study. Specific events 
that will require discontinuing a subject from receiving the study product include: 
1. Pregnancy;  
2. Grade [ADDRESS_144524] (with the exception that self -limited 
Grade [ADDRESS_144525] administration);  
3. Grade [ADDRESS_144526] ;  
4. Immediate hypersensitivity reaction associated with the study product; 
5. Intercurrent illness that is not expected to resolve prior to the next scheduled study product administration  which is assessed by [CONTACT_978] (or designee)  to require withdrawal from the 
product administration;  
6. Repeated failure to comply with protocol requi rements;  
7. Co-enrollment into a study in which other investigational research agents will be 
administered  before the subject has completed  the follow-up after the last VRC0 7-523 LS 
administration ; 
8. The IND sponsor or the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_128149];

 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is any  untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporal ly associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to 
the study treatment.   
Severity of AEs will be assessed using the Version 2.0 of the  DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity 
of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events [November 2014]. The table is available at : http://rsc.tech -
res.com/Document/safetyandpharmacovigilance/DAIDS_AE_GRADING_TABLE_v2_NOV2014.pdf.  Additional information can be found in Appendix IV .   
Reporting of all AEs will occur during the period from first study product administration  through [ADDRESS_144529] administration .  After this through completion of study participation 
only serious adverse events (SAEs) and new chronic medical conditions that require ongoing medical management will be recorded as AEs in the study database.   
 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
The term “Serious Adverse Event” (SAE) is defined in 21 CFR 312.32 as follows:  “ An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  Death, a life -threatening adverse event , 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persis tent or significant 
incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions , or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128151] c onsidered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.” 
“Life -threatening” refers to an AE that at occurrence represents an immediate risk of death to a 
PRODUCT: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0  
 PROTOCOL DATE: OCTOB ER 11, [ADDRESS_144530]. An event that may cause death if it occurs in a more severe form is not considered life-
threatening.  Similarly, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128152] a SAE. 
 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING TO THE IND  SPONSOR  
AEs that meet Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting Requirements must be reported and submitted by [CONTACT_128175] , VRC/NIAID/NIH, 
according to Sponsor guidelines as foll ows:  
• results in death  
• is life threatening  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• requires unplanned inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject  
• is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
In addition, any event, regardless of severity, which in the judgment of an investigator represents a 
SAE, may be reported on an expedited basis. 
An investigator will communicate an initial SAE report within 24 hours of site awareness of 
occurrence to the IND sponsor by [CONTACT_33831]  (see Appendix II).  
A written report by [CONTACT_128176] 3 working days.  
In order for the IND Sponsor to comply with regulations mandating sponsor notification of 
specified SAEs to the FDA within 7 and/ or [ADDRESS_144531] submit 
additional information as soon as it is available.  
5.3.1 IND Sponsor Reporting to the FDA 
It is the responsibility of the IND Sponsor to make the determination of which SAEs are “s erious 
and unexpected suspected adverse reactions” (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) as  defined in 21 CFR 312.32. 
• Suspected adverse reaction  means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE . 
• Unexpected Adverse Event  means an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed.   
All S[LOCATION_003]Rs, as  determined by [CONTACT_9533], will be reported to  the FDA as IND Safety 
Reports and IND Safety Reports will be provided to the IRB. 
The IND Sponsor will also submit an IND Annual Report of the progress of the investigation to the 
FDA as defined in [ADDRESS_144532]  
5.4.1 Unanticipated Problem (UP) Definition  
A serious “Unanticipated P roblem (UP)” is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all three of the following criteria:  
PRODUCT: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0  
 PROTOCOL DATE: OCTOB ER 11, 2017    
Page 25 of 62 • unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency in relation to the research risks that are 
described in the protocol, informed consent, IB, other study documents or in consideration 
of the character istics of the subject population being studied; and 
• related to participation in the research; and 
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
Non-serious UP: An UP  that is n ot an Adverse Event (UPnonAE) is an unanticipated problem that 
does not fit the definition of an AE , but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], involve risk 
to the subject, affect other s in the research study, or significantly impact the integrity of research 
data.  Such events would be considered a non- serious UP. For example, we will report occurrences 
of breaches of confidentiality, accidental destruction of study records or samples , or unaccounted-
for study drug.  
5.4.2 Protocol Deviation Definition  
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB -approved 
study procedures in a research protocol. Protocol deviations are designated as serious or non-serious and further characterized as  follows: 
• Those that occur because a member of the research team deviates from the protocol.  
• Those that are identified before they occur, but cannot be prevented. 
• Those that are discovered after they occur . 
Serious Protocol Deviation: A deviation that meets the definition of a SAE  or compromises the 
safety,  integrity of the data,  welfare or rights of subjects or others.  
5.4.3  Non -Compliance Definition  
Non-compliance is t he failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Protecti ons Program 
(HRPP ) policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human 
subjects. Non- compliance is further characterized as  serious, continuing or minor. 
“Serious non-compliance” is defined as non-compliance that : 
• Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants  
• Decreases potential benefits to participants  
• Compromises the integrity of the NIH -HRPP  
• Invalidates the study data  
“Continuing non- compliance ” is non- compliance that is recurring . 
“Minor non-compliance” is non- compliance that  is neither serious nor continuing. 
5.4.4 Expedited Reporting to the NIAID IRB 
The following will be reported within 7 calendar days of investigator awareness: 
• Serious and non- serious UP

• Serious or continuing non- compliance  
• SAEs that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the rese arch regardless of 
expectedness  
The following w aiver  applies to r eporting a nticipated protocol deviations and expected UPnonAEs:  
Anticipated deviation s in the conduct of the protocol will not be reported to the IRB unless they 
occur at a rate greater than anticipated by [CONTACT_3476]. Expected AEs will not be reported to the 
IRB unless they occur at a rate great er than that known to occur in healthy adults . If the rate of these 
events exceeds the rate expected by [CONTACT_3476], the events will be classified and reported as 
though they are unanticipated problems.  
5.4.5 Annual Reporting to the NIAID IRB 
The following will be reported to the NIAID IRB in summa ry at the time of Continuing Review: 
• Serious and non-serious UPs  
• Expected SAEs that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the research  
• SAE s that are not related to the research  
• All AEs, except expected AEs granted a waiver of reportin g  
• Serious and non-serious Protocol Deviations  
• Serious, continuing, and minor non- compliance

00-AB (VRC0 7-523 LS), a human monoclonal antibody with broad HIV- 1 neutralizing activity, 
administered to healthy  adults. 
 OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VRC0 7-523LS  administered at  1 
mg/kg IV, 5 mg/kg IV, 5 mg/kg SC, 20 mg/kg IV and 40 mg/kg IV  as a single dose, and 
administered at 20 mg/kg IV and 5 mg/kg SC by [CONTACT_128169] [ADDRESS_144533]: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0  
 PROTOCOL DATE: OCTOB ER 11, 2017

 SIZE AND ACCRUAL  
Recruitment will target about 25 healthy  adults of age 18-50 with 3 subjects in each dose escalation  
group (Groups 1-5), and 5 subjects in  each  repeat dosing group (Groups 6 and 7).  The permitted 
accrual is [ADDRESS_144534] in 
order to complete the safety dataset as planned.   
Dose escalation rules are described in Section 4.3. 
6.3.2 Sample Size Considerations 
This study is primarily descriptive.  For safety analysis, the goal is to identify safety concerns 
associated with different VRC0 7-523LS doses.  There may be as few as 3  to 5 subjects in a group at 
the time of a dose escalation ; therefore, this section considers group sizes of both n=3 and n=5. 
The ability to identify serious adverse experiences is best expressed by [CONTACT_128177]. Within a group of size n=3, there is a 90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate is no less than 0.536 and a 90% chance of observing no event if the true rate is no bigger than 
0.034. Within a group of size n=5, there is a 90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate is no less than 0.37 and a 90% chance of observing no event if the true rate is no bigger than 0.02. 
Probabilities of observing [ADDRESS_144535].  For example, within the group of size 
n=3, if the true event rate is 0.01, then there is a probability of 0.97 to observe no event and a 
probability of <0.001 to observe more than 1 event; while, within the group of size n=5, if the true event rate is 0.01, then there is a probability of 0.[ADDRESS_144536]: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0

Solicited AE s:  Solicited AE data is collected  after each dose administered in this study.  T he 
number and percentage of subjects experiencing each type of solicited  sign or symptom will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_926].   For a given sign or symptom, each subject’s solicited AEs  will be counted 
once under the maximum severity for all assessments.  
Unsol icited AE s:  Unsolicited AEs are coded into MedDRA preferred terms.   The number and 
percentages of participants experiencing each specific AE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_98262].  For the calculations in these tables, each participant’s adverse experience 
will be counted once under the maximum severity or strongest recorded causal relationship to 
treatment.  
A complete listing of adverse experiences for each participant will provide details including severity, relationship to treatmen t type, onset, duration and outcome. 
Local Laboratory V alues
:  Boxplots of local laboratory values will be generated for baseline values 
and for values measured during the course of the study.  Each boxplot will show the 1st quartile, the median, and the 3rd quartile.  Outliers, or values outside the boxplot, will also be plotted.  If 
appropriate, horizontal lines representing boundaries for abnormal values will be plotted. 
6.4.[ADDRESS_144539] [19].  VRC [ADDRESS_144540] Pharmacokinetic Analysis :  A non- compartmental PK analysis will be 
performed using Phoenix (Centara) or a similar program on the VRC0 7-523LS  concentration data 
generated from each subject .  Calculated PK parameters for IV Groups 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 will include: 
area-under-the- curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), clearance 
(CL), volume of distribution (Vdz), terminal elimination rate constant ( λz) and the terminal half -life 
(T1/2).  For Groups 3 and 6, the PK parameters will include AUC, Cmax, Tmax, apparent clearance 
(CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (Vdz /F), λz and T 1/2.  Cmax and Tmax will be taken 
directly from the observed concentration- time data.   The terminal slope, λ z, will be dete rmined 
from the log-linear portion of the curve and the T 1/2 calculated as 0.693/ λz.  AUC 0-Clast will be 
determined using the linear trapezoidal method , where C last is the concentration at [ADDRESS_144541] two doses in Groups 6 and 7 and the concentration at 24 weeks after dose in Groups 1, 2, 4 and 5 and final dose in Groups 6 and 7.  If the final sample (C
last) has measurable VRC0 7-523 LS 
concentrations, the remaining AUC after the final concentration  (AUC Clast -inf) will be estimated as 
Clast/λz.  Data will be summarized based by [CONTACT_128178]: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0

among IV groups will be determined by [CONTACT_128179]-adjusted ratios for Cmax and AUC 
between IV groups.  Additional compartmental analysis will be performed as warranted by [CONTACT_26739].  
Population Pharmacokinetic Analys es:  Population PK  analyses will be performed on the 
VRC0 7-523LS PK  data following IV and SQ administration  to determine compartmental PK 
parameters with the program NONMEM.   One and two compartment PK models will be assessed.   
Based on prior PK  studies of antibodies, including VRC01, it is anticipated that a tw o compartment 
model will adequately  characterize the data.  The population analysis wil l generate estimates for 
initial and final volumes of distribution (V d1 and Vd 2), inter- compartmental clearance (Q),  CL and 
bioavailability ( F).  Given the small subject numbers, the population PK  analysis will not include an 
exploratory covariate analysis  to assess clinical factors as fixed effects associated with VRC0 7-
523LS PK parameters with the exception of dose (5 vs 20 vs 40 mg/kg ), and first vs subsequent 
doses as a fixed effect s on CL, Vd 1, and Vd 2.  The terminal half -life, t 1/2β will be determined from

VRC -HIVMAB075-00- AB ( VRC07 -523LS) is supplied at a concentration of 100 mg/mL ± 10 
mg/mL  in an isotonic, sterile solution; two fill volumes are available: 2.5 ± 0.1 mL in a 3 mL glass 
vial and 6.25 ± 0.1 mL in a 10 mL glass vial. Vials contain a clear, colorless to yellow liquid 
essentially free of visible particles; some opaque or translucent particles may be present .  The 
formulation buffer is composed of 50 mM Histidine, 50 mM Sodium Chloride, 5% Sucrose, and 
2.5% Sorbitol at pH 6.8.  Vials are intended for single-use only and thus do not contain a preservative.  
In this trial, dose is limited or established based on subject weight.   In calculating the dose to 
administer and number of vials to thaw, it should be assumed that the concentration is 100 mg/mL and that a volume of at least 6 mL can be withdrawn from a vial.  Preparation of VRC0 7-523 LS for 
IV administration will require a 100 mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride, USP (normal saline).

 VRC  HIVMAB075 -00-AB (VRC07 -523LS)  VIALED PRODUCT  
The VRC07 -523LS product label designates the long- term storage temperature as  -35°C to -
15°C.  Clinical site storage in a qualified, continuously monitored, temperature- controlled freezer 
with temperature excursions -45°C to -10°C is acceptable.   
Following thaw, VRC07-523LS vials may be stored for up to 24 hours at controlled room 
temperature (maxi mum 27°C) and/or up to [ADDRESS_144545] sunlight. If stored at 2-8°C, vials must be equilibrated at controlled room temperature 
(maximum 27oC) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_144546] promptly report any storage temperature excursions outside of the normal 
allowance for the storage device to the IND Sponsor ( Appendix II).  The affected product must be 
quarantined in a separate area.  The IND Sponsor will notify the site pharmacist if continued clinical use of the product is acceptable. 
 PREPARATION OF STUDY PRODUCT  FOR ADMINISTRATION  
This section describes how the site pharmacist will prepare the study product for administration  and 
how the clinician will administer the product.  Clinician instructions on how to select an 
administration site are in Section 4.2.3.   
VRC07 -523LS is a highly concentrated protein solution and may develop white, opaque to 
translucent particles after thawing. When particles are observed, the y may disappear after a few 
hours at room temperature or storage at 2oC to 8oC.  
The following instructions apply to thawing VRC07 -523LS: 
1. Thaw vial(s) for a minimum of 1 hour at  controlled room temperature ( maximum 27°C) 
after removing from the freezer.   
2. Keep the material at room temperature during the entire preparation period until use , up 
to the maximum storage times described in S ection 7.2. 
3. Prior to preparation for administration, vials should be swirled for 30 seconds with 
sufficient force to resuspend any visible particles, yet avoiding foaming. DO NOT 
SHAKE THE VIALS. If par ticles are observed , return the vials to 2°C to 8°C storage. If 
the particles redissolve within the maximum storage times described in Section 7.2, the 
vials may be used for product preparation. If particles continue to be observed, do not 
use the vialed product for SC  or IV administration .  Refrigerated product must be 
equilibrated at controlled room temperature (maximum 27oC) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_144547]: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0

 RISKS  
Risks of Administration of MAb s: Administration of MAbs may have a risk of immune reactions 
such as acute anaphylaxis, serum sickness and the g eneration of antibodies.  However, these 
reactions are rare and more often associated with MAb s targeted to human proteins or with the use 
of murine MAbs  that would have a risk of human anti-mouse antibodies [ 20].  In this regard, 
because VRC 07-[ADDRESS_144555] a 
low risk of such side effects.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897],  the side effects of MAb s are mild and may include reactions at injection site (pain, 
redness, bruising swelling), fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, 
shortness of breath, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, pruritus, rash, urticaria, angio edema, 
diarrhea, tachycardia or  chest pain .  Clinical use of  MAb s that are targeted to cytokines or antigens 
associated with human cells may be associated with an increased risk of infections [ 20]; however, 
this is not expected to be a risk for a MAb  targeted to a viral antigen.  
It is known from published experience with human MAb s directed against the cell surface targets on 
lymphocytes that infusion of a MAb  may be associated with cytokine release , causing  a reaction  
known as “cytokine release syndrome” (CRS ) [21].  Most infusion-related events occur within the 
first 24 hours after beginning administration.  Severe reactions, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, 
bronchospasm, hypotension and hypoxia, are infrequent and more often associated with MAb s 
targeted to human proteins or with non-human MAb , such as a murine MAb  [20].  CRS reactions 
most commonly occur within the first few hours of beginning infusion and with the first MAb  
infusion received.  This is because the cytokine release is associated with lysis of the cells targeted 
by [CONTACT_128181].  With 
licensed therapeutic MAb s, CRS  is managed by [CONTACT_86964][INVESTIGATOR_51119], administ ering  
histamine blockers and restarting the infusion at a slower rate  [22].  
Delayed allergic reactions to a MAb  may include a serum sickness type of reactio n, which is 
characterized by [CONTACT_22815], fever, lymph node enlargement, and joint pains.  S ymptoms may not 
appear until several days after the exposure to the Mab.  This type of reaction is  noted to be more 
common with chimeric types of MAb  [20].

Risks of Blood Drawing :  Blood drawing may cause pain and bruising and, infrequently, may cause 
a feeling of lightheadedness or fainting. R arely,  it may cause infection at the site where blood is 
taken.  In this study, an IV line that can be used for blood collection may be placed and left in place 
for several hours on the days when there are frequent PK blood draws.  Problems  from use of an IV 
for blood drawing are generally mild and  may include pain, bruising, minor swelling or bleeding at 
the IV site and rarely, infection, vein i rritation (called phlebitis),  or blood clot.  
Risks of Oral Mucosa Sample Collection : Collection of samples by [CONTACT_128182], in some cases, minor bleeding.

 PLAN FOR USE AND STORAGE OF BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES  
The plan for use and storage of biological samples from this protocol is as outlined as follows. 
PRODUCT: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0  
 PROTOCOL DATE: OCTOB ER 11, [ADDRESS_144557].  Samples are stored at the NIAID Vaccine Immune T -Cell and Antibody Laborat ory 
(NVITAL), Gaithersburg, MD or VRC Laboratories in Building 40, which are both secure facilities with limited access .  Data will be kept in password-protected computers.  Only inve stigators or their 
designees  will have access to the samples and data.   Samples will be tracked in the Laboratory 
Information Management System (LIMS) database or using another software designed for this purpose (e.g., Freezerworks). 
7.9.3 Disposition of S amples , Specimens  and D ata at  Completion of the Protocol  
In the future, other investigators (both at NIH and outside) may wish to study these samples and/or data.  IRB approval must be sought prior to any sharing of samples.  A ny clinical information 
shared about those samples would similarly require prior IRB approval.  The research use of stored, unlinked or unidentified samples may be exempt from the need for prospective IRB review and approval.  Exemption requests will be submitted in writing to the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research, which is authorized to determine whether a research activity is exempt.  
At the time of protocol termination , samples will remain in the NVITAL facility or VRC 
laboratories or, after IRB approval, transferred t o another  repository.  Regulatory oversight of the 
stored samples and data may be transferred to a stored samples protocol as part of the IRB-approved termination plan.  Data will be archived by [CONTACT_128183], or after IRB and study sponsor approval, it may be either destroyed or transferred to another repository. 
7.9.4 Loss or Destruction of S amples , Specimens  or D ata 
The NIH Intramural Protocol Deviation  definition related to loss of or destruction of samples or 
data will be followed .  Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples (for example, due to freezer 
malfunction) or data (for example, misplacing a printout of data with identifiers) that compromises the scientific integrity of the study will be reported to the IRB  in accordance with institutional 
policies . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_125523].

 INTRODUCTION 
We invite you to take part in a research study at the N ational Institutes of Health (NIH).  First, 
we want you to know that:  Taking part in NIH research is entirely voluntary.  You may choose not to take part, or you may withdraw from the study at any time.  In 
either case, you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  
However, to receive care at the NIH, you must be taking part in a study or be under evaluation for study participation. 
 You may receive no benefit from taking part.  The research may give us knowledge that 
may help people in the future. 
Second, some people have personal, religious or ethical beliefs that may limit the kinds of medical or research treatments they would want to receive (such as blood transfusions).  If you have such beliefs, please discuss them with your NIH doctors or research team before you agree to the study.  
Now we will describe this research study.  Before you decide to take part, please take as much time as you need to ask any questions and discuss this study with anyone at NIH, or with family, friends or your personal physician or other health professional.
PURPOSE  AND PLAN  OF THE STUDY  
This is the study of an ex perimental product called “VRC07 -523LS.”  The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA ) allows it to be used for research only.  VRC07 -523LS is an antibody 
directed against HIV virus.  The human body uses antibodies as one way to help fight infection.  
There is currently no cure for  HIV  or vaccine to prevent it.   
The main purpose of this study is to see if the experimental product is safe and well -tolerated.  
We will study the amount of VRC07 -523LS in the body and how it changes over time.  We will 
check to see if people who get VRC07 -523LS make an  immune response  (antibody) to it. 
About [ADDRESS_144566]  
VRC07 -523LS is a monoclonal antibody or “MAb .”  An antibody is a protein that is used by [CONTACT_128189], like HIV.  Monoclonal
 means that all the 
antibodies in the product are the same.  The formal name [CONTACT_128208]- HIVMAB 075-
00-AB.   
VRC07 -523LS is a human antibody but it is  a genetically modified synthetic product .  It was 
made based on an antibody that was first found in an HIV-infected person.  Although the 
antibody was found in a human, the product is not made by [CONTACT_128190] a human.  VRC07 -
523LS was developed by [CONTACT_33862] (VRC)  at NIH.  This product was made in

• Intravenous (IV) Route Dose Groups :  
If you are in a group getting VRC07 -523LS by [CONTACT_128192], we will place a thin tube or IV 
line in a vein on your arm on the day you get the study product.  If needed, we will place a 
second IV line in a vein on your other arm for blood sample collection.   VRC07 -523LS will 
be mixed into a bag of liquid called “normal saline” or salt water .  The mix of normal saline 
and VRC07 -523LS will be given directly into your vein .  A pump will control how fast the 
study product goes into the vein.  The goa l is to give it over about [ADDRESS_144571] blood samples. 
o Blood sample collections  for IV Groups :  
On the day of your first IV infusion  of VRC07-523LS, we will collect blood samples from 
you before and right after  the infusion, and about [ADDRESS_144572] blood  samples from you before and right after the infusion, 
and then again about 1 hour after the i nfusion.  You will also be asked to come back to the 
clinic 4-5 times  after each repeat dose.  
• Subcutaneous (SC) Route Dose Groups : 
If you are in a group getting VRC07 -523LS by [CONTACT_128193], we will put a small needle into 
the fatty tissue under your skin.  The abdominal area is usually where the needle will be  
inserted in your body.  It is possible w e may use your arm or thigh area instead.  VRC07 -
523LS will not be mixed with any other liquid.  You will get the SC doses by [CONTACT_128194] a

o Blood sample collections for SC Groups : 
On the day of your first SC injection of VRC07 -523LS, we will collect blood samples 
from you before the injection.  You will also be asked to come back to the clinic [ADDRESS_144574] this information 
on an electronic form or “diary.”  If you prefer, you can  use a paper diary instead.   
If you have any side effects, you should tell a VRC  nurse or doctor as soon as possible.  You can

We will use some blood samples to study if your body develops an immune response 
(antibodies) to the study product.  These tests are for research purposes only and are not for 
checking on your health.  We will not give you these results.  After completing this study, we may invite you to take part  in another study for follow- up sample collection.
 
Experimental studies follow a set schedule.   This helps us answer the research questions. 
Scheduling for your visits allows some flexibility, but it is important that you work with the staff to follow the schedule.  You should try to not miss any visits.  You might need to have extra clinic visits an d laboratory tests if you have health changes that need to be checked.  
Collection of Oral Secretion  Sample s for Research  
If you are willing, we will collect samples of the mouth (oral /saliva ) for research during 3-6 
study visits, depending on your study group.  Collection of these samples is encouraged but not required.  If you choose to provide such samples, you may change your mind at any time throughout the study.  You may choose not to donate these samples but still take part  in the 
study.  
Oral samples will be collected with small disposable sponges , similar to a “Q -tip,” which are 
made for this purpose.  Each sponge is new and sterile, and is safe for use in sensitive areas of 
the body.  These samples are collected to see how VRC07 -523LS is distributed in your body.  They will not 
be for checking your health and do not replace routine health care.

MONITORING OF THE STUDY A group of ph ysicians and scientists at NIH will monitor this study.  This group will review the 
information from the study and will pay close attention to possible harmful reactions.  If serious 
side effects  occur, VRC07 -523LS administrations may be delayed or canceled. 
GENETIC TESTING  
Some of the blood drawn from you as part of this study will be used for genetic tests.  Some 
genetic tests are done in research studies to see if genetic differences in people cause different types of immune responses.  Your blood sample used in these genetic tests will not have your name [CONTACT_128209].  These tests are not used to check your health and we will not tell you the results.  
A special genetic test, called HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], is done by [CONTACT_941] N IH Clinical Center medical laboratory.    
These results will be in your medical record but they will not be used to check your health.  Any 
genetic testing, including HLA testing , is for research purposes only. Any genetic information 
collected or learned about you will be kept confidential.  Medical records, including HLA test 
results , are kept securely.  We will not give any genetic information that is in your medical 
record to anyone without your permission. 
STORED SAMPLES  
We will collect samples (including blood and possibly oral secretions) from you during the 
study.  We will keep these samples for future research to learn more about monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, the immune system, and/or other medical conditions.  Results from research with your samples will not be in your medical record or reported to you.  
Labeling of Stored Samples : We will label your stored samples by a special code or number.  
Only the study team can link this code to you.  Any identifying information about you (like name 
[CONTACT_128210]) will be kept as confidential as allowable by [CONTACT_2371] .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_125528], there is a 
small chance that information identifying you will be given to someone who should not get it.  
Risks from Stored Samples : There is a risk of unplanned release of information from your 
medical records.  The chance that this information will be given to an unauthorized person 
without your permission is very small.  Possible problems with the unplanned release of 
information include discrimination when applying for insurance and employment.  Similar problems may occur if you give information about yourself or agree to have your medical 
records released.

POSSIBLE STUDY RISKS  
Risks from IV  infusions or SC injections :
 It is possible that you may have some side effec ts.  
General r isks of methods that use a needle include stinging, discomfort, pain, soreness, redness, 
bruising, swelling  or a tiny cut at the needle insertion  site. 
Risks of VRC07 -523LS : This study is the first time that VRC07 -523LS is being given to people. 
VRC07 -523LS is similar  to the VRC monoclonal antibody, VRC01 .  More than [ADDRESS_144577] is given.  However, we rarely  saw these reactions when VRC01 was given. 
When reactions were reported , they were usually mild.  VRC01 given by [CONTACT_128195], redness and/or swelling at site of injection . These symptoms 
usually cleared within a few minutes to hours after the product was given. In an ongoing study, 
additional product injections were discontinued for one subject who developed mild chest 
discomfort and for one subject who developed mild rash that were assoc iated with  study product 
administration  (VRC01 or placebo).  
We are giving VRC07 -523LS at a controlled rate.  If symptoms occur while VRC07 -523LS is 
being given, tell the nurse.  Slowing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_100386].    Some antibody products have a risk of serious allergic reactions that can be  life-threatening.   
PRODUCT: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0  
 PROTOCOL DATE: OCTOB ER 11, 2017    
Page 48 of 62 • Anaphylaxis is one type of allergic reaction that may happen  soon after an antibody 
product is given.  This reaction can include difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, hives 
or rash, swelling in the mouth and face.  
• Serum sickness is a delayed type of allergic reaction that may happen  several days to 
three weeks after an antibody product is given.  This reaction can include hives or rash, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, muscle pains, joint pains, chest discomfort and shortness of breath.   
Some antibodies of the type that attack human proteins can  increase the  risk of serious infections.  
VRC07 -523LS is not expected to increase the risk of serious infections because i t attacks a virus  
and not a human protein. 
In addition to the possible risks that are listed above, VRC07 -523LS may have other side effect s 
that we do not know about yet.  Parti cipation in this study may affect your eligibility for future 
monoclonal antibody  studies.   We will give you  any new information about risks or other 
information that becomes available that may affect your decision  to continue in the study. 
Risks of Blood Drawing
: Blood drawing may cause pain and bruising and rarely , may cause a 
feeling of lightheadedness or fainting.  Rarely, it may cause infection at the site where the blood is taken.  In this study on the day of an infusion, an IV line may be placed in your vein and left for a few hours.  Problems at the IV site are usually mild and may include pain, bruising, minor swelling or bleeding.  Rarely, there may be an infection, vein irritation, or a blood clot.   
Risks of Oral Mucosa Sample Collection : Collection of samples by [CONTACT_128196], rarely , a little  
bleeding.  
Risk of a False Positive HIV Antibody Test Caused by [CONTACT_33805]07 -523LS : An HIV antibody test is 
the usual way to test fo r HIV infection.  VRC01 and VRC07 -523LS are antibodies  against HIV. 
Based on laboratory testing, VRC01 does not cause a positive HIV antibody test in standard diagnostic tests.  Since VRC07 -523LS is similar to VRC01, we expect that VRC07 -523LS does 
not cause a positive HIV antibody test.  However, we do not know yet if it will cause a positive HIV antibody test or not .  We will test for HIV antibodies at some visits.  If you  ever need or 
want an HI V test while you are on the study, please ask  the VRC Clinic to do the test.  We will 
tell you the results  of your HIV test . 
Risks during Pregnancy : We do not know what effects VRC07 -523LS may have on a fetus or 
nursing infant.  Women who are able to have children must agree to not get pregnant during study participation.   We will discuss effective birth control methods with you.  
You must notify the clinic staff right away if you get pregnant during this study or think that you 
might be pregnant. If you get  pregnant, you will not get any more VRC07 -523LS administrations  
and we will not collect any more blood for research .  However, you will be asked to continue 
with study follow -up visits to check on your health and to report the outcome of the pregnancy to 
us, which will be reported to the antiretroviral pregnancy registry ( http://www.apregistry.com).   
POSSIBLE BENEFITS  
This study will not provide you with any direct health benefit . You and others may benefit in the 
future from the information that we learn  from the study.

1 Day 0=day of first product administration.  Day [ADDRESS_144600]  administration are the baseline for assessing subsequent AEs.   
2 Screening includes physical exam with vital signs, height (ht) and weight (wt).  At other visits, if medically indicated, a t argeted exam is performed.  Otherwise only blood pressure (BP), 
pulse, and temperature are required, except at Visit [ADDRESS_144601] , dosed  based  on “mg/kg”.  
3 The PK blood draw “visits,” defined by [CONTACT_128201], are relative to the exact time of the end of injection  (EOI).  The exact start and end times of product administration and the 
time of PK blood draw(s) are recorded to ensure accurate PK analysis.   All subjects will be observed for [ADDRESS_144602], ALP and creatinine will be collected at all scheduled timepoints. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) will be collected at screening, baseline, and [ADDRESS_144603] is given .   
6 HLA type blood sample is collected once at any timepoint in the study and is shown as a Visit 11 evaluation for convenience; however, if HLA type is already available in the medical 
record it does not need to be repeated.  HLA type may also be obtained from a frozen sample.  
7 Oral mucosa sample collection is encouraged but not mandatory.  [X] indicates optional, as needed.  
 Visit windows : Visit 02A (±10 min); Visits 03, 04, 05 (± 6 hrs); Visits 06, 07, 08, 09 ( ±2 days); Visits 10, 11, 15, 16, 17 ( ±7 days).  Visits [ADDRESS_144604]: VRC-HIVMAB0 75-00-AB                                                                          PROTOCOL: VRC 605, VERSION 4.0

 INTRODUCTION 
We invite you to take part in a research study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
First, we want you to know that:  
 Taking part in NIH research is entirely voluntary.  
 You may choose not to take part, or you may withdraw from the stud y at any time.  In either case, you will not 
lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  However, to receive care at the NIH, you must be taking 
part in a study or be under evaluation for study participation.  
 You may receive no benefit from taking part.  The research may give us knowledge that may help people in the future.  
Second, some people have personal, religious or ethical beliefs that may limit the kinds of medical or research treatments they would want to receive (such as blood transfus ions).  If you have such beliefs, please discuss them with your NIH 
doctors or research team before you agree to the study.  
Now we will describe this research study.  Before you decide to take part, please take as much time as you need to ask any questions  and discuss this study with anyone at NIH, or with family, friends or your personal physician or other health 
professional. 
PURPOSE AND PLAN OF THE STUDY  
This is the study of an experimental product called “VRC07 -523LS .”  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  allows 
it to be used for research only. VRC07 -523LS is an antibody directed against HIV virus.  The human body uses antibodies 
as one way to help fight infection.   There is currently no cure for HIV or vaccine to prevent it.   
The main purpose o f this study is to see if the experimental product is safe and well-tolerated.   We will study the amount 
of VRC07 -523LS in the body and how it changes over time.  We will check to see if people who get VRC07 -523LS make an 
immune response (antibody) to it. 
About [ADDRESS_144640]  
about 13-27 clinic visits over 24 -48 weeks for each person, depending on the study group.

 P.A.: [ADDRESS_144641]  
VRC07 -523LS is a monoclona l antibody or “MAb.”  An antibody is a protein that is used by [CONTACT_128202], like HIV.  Monoclonal  means that all the antibodies in the product are the same.   
The formal  name [CONTACT_128208] -HIVMAB0 75-00-AB.  VRC07 -523LS is a human antibody but it is a genetically 
modified synthetic product .  It was made  based on an antibody that was first found in an HIV -infected person.  Although 
the antibody was found in a human, the product is not made by [CONTACT_128203] a human.   
VRC07 -523LS was developed by [CONTACT_128204] (VRC) at NIH.  This product was made in a drug 
manufacturing laboratory.  This is the first study to give VRC07 -523LS to humans.  
VRC07 -523LS is similar to the monoclonal antibody VRC01 and was manufactured in a similar way.  VRC01 has been given 
to over [ADDRESS_144642] completed the screening process and are known to be the 
following: 
• 18 to 50 years old  
• In general good health without significant medical problems as determined at screening 
• Willing to get  VRC0 7-523LS  
• Willing to donate  blood samples for future research  
• Willing to be tested for HIV infection  
• If female and able to get pregnant: willing to use birth control for the whole  study.  
STUDY PROCEDURES

Total [ADDRESS_144645] use an effective method of birth control for the 
entire study.  
• Intravenous (IV) Route Dose  Groups :  
If you are in a group getting VRC07 -523LS by [CONTACT_16228], we will place a thin tube or IV line in a vein on your arm on 
the day you get the study product.  If needed, we will place a second IV line in a vein on your other arm for blood 
sample collection.  VRC07 -523LS will be mixed into a bag of liquid called “normal saline” or salt water.  The mix of 
normal saline and VRC07 -523LS will be given directly into your vein.  A pump will control how fast the study product 
goes into the vein.  The goal is to give it over about [ADDRESS_144646] blood samples.  
o Blood sample collections for IV G roups :  
On the day of your first IV infusion  of VRC07 -523LS , we will collect blood samples from you before and right after 
the infusion, and about [ADDRESS_144647] blood samples from you before and right after the infusion, and then again 
about 1 hour after the infusion.  You will also be asked to come back to the clinic 4 -5 times after each repeat dose.  
• Subcutaneous ( SC) Route Dose Groups : 
If you are in a group getting VRC07 -523LS by [CONTACT_10530], w e will put a small needle into the fatty tissue under your 
skin.  The abdominal area is usually where the needle will be inserted in your body.  It is possible we may use your arm or thigh area instead.  VRC07 -523LS will not be mixed with any other liquid.  You will get the SC doses by 
[CONTACT_128194] a standard needle and syringe in [ADDRESS_144648] four  hours.   
o Blood sample collections for SC G roups : 
On the day of your first SC injection of VRC07 -523LS, we will collect blood samples from you before the injection.  
You will also be asked to come back to the clinic [ADDRESS_144649] blood samples from you before 
each injection.  You will also be asked to come back to the clinic 4 -5 times after each repeat dose.

[ADDRESS_144651] results 
show a health problem.   
We will use some blood samples to study if your body develops an immune response (an tibodies) to the study product.  
These  tests are  for research purposes only and are  not for checking on your health.  W e will not give you these results.  
After completing this study, we may invite you to take part  in another study for follow -up sample collection.  
Experimental studies follow a set schedule.  This helps us answer the research questions. Scheduling for your visits allows some flexibility, but it is important that you work with the staff to follow the schedule.  You should try to not miss any visits.  You might need to have extra clinic visits and lab oratory tests if you have health changes that need to be checked.  
COLLECTION OF ORAL  SECRETION  SAMPLE S FOR RESEARCH  
If you are willing, we will collect samples of the mouth (oral/saliva) for research during 3 -6 study visits, depending on 
your study group.   Collection of these samples is encouraged but not required.  If you choose to provide such samples, 
you may change your mind at any time throughout the study.  You may choose not to donate these samples but still take part in the study.  
Oral samples will be collected with small disposable sponges, similar to a “Q- tip,” which are made for this purpose.  Each 
sponge is new and sterile, and is safe for use in sensitive areas of the body.  
These samples are collected to see how VRC07 -523LS is distributed in your body.  They will not be for checking your 
health and do not replace routine health care.  
HIV TESTING AND COUNSELING  
As part of your participation in this study, we will provide you with HIV counseling and testing. We will test you for HIV infection a nd possibly for other infections if needed to check your eligibility for the study.  We will tell you how to remain 
HIV-uninfected and give you prevention resources.  If you are infected with HIV, you will not be able to participate in this 
study.  We will tell you what the results mean, how to find care, how to avoid infecting others, how we report HIV infection, and the importance of informing your partners that may be at risk because of your HIV infection. 
If you have questions regarding the HIV testing,  you are encouraged to discuss them with the study nurse or doctor, or 
you may call a NIH Clinical Center HIV counselor at . 
MONITORING OF THE STUDY  
A group of physicians and scientists at NIH will monitor this study.  This group will review  the information from the study 
and will pay close attention to possible harmful reactions.   If serious side effects occur, VRC07 -523LS  administrations may 
be delayed or canceled.

 P.A.: [ADDRESS_144652] samples (including blood and possibly oral secretions) from you during the study.  We will keep th ese 
samples for future research to learn more about monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, the immune system, and/or other medical conditions.  Results from research with your samples will not be in your medical record or reported to you.  
Labeling of Stored Sam ples:   We will label your stored samples by a special code or number.  Only the study team can 
link this code to you.  Any identifying information about you (like name [CONTACT_40234]) will be kept as confidential as allowable by [CONTACT_2371].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_125528], there is a small chance that information identifying you will be given to someone who should not get it.  
Risks from Stored Samples:   There is a risk of unplanned release of information from your medical records.  The 
chance that this information will be given to an unauthorized person without your permission is very small.  Possible problems with the unplanned release of information include discrimination when applying for insurance and employment.  Similar problems may occur if you give information about  yourself or agree to have your medical records released.  
Future Studies:   In the future, other investigators (at NIH or outside of NIH) may wish to study your stored samples.  
When your stored samples are shared, they will be marked with a code.  Your sam ples will not have any identifying 
information on them.  Some information about you, such as your gender, age, health history, or ethnicity may also be shared with other researchers. 
Any future research studies using your samples will be conducted in a way  that protects the rights and privacy of study 
participants.  Your stored samples will be used only for research and will not be sold.  The research done with your 
materials may be used to develop new products in the future but you will not receive payment  for such products.  
Making your Choice:   You cannot take part in this study if you do not want us to collect or store your blood samples.  If 
you agree to take part in this study, you must also agree to let us keep any of your samples for future research.  If you 
decide not to take part in this study, you may still take part in other studies at NIH.  
POSSIBLE STUDY RISKS 
Risks from IV infusions or SC injections:   It is possible that you may have some side effects.  General risks of methods 
that use a needle include stinging, discomfort, pain, soreness, redness, bruising, swelling or a tiny cut at the needle 
insertion site.  
Risks of VRC0 7-523LS :  This study is the first time that VRC07- 523LS is being given to people.   
VRC07 -523LS is similar to the VRC monoclonal antibody, VRC01.  More than [ADDRESS_144653] been given safely

 P.A.: [ADDRESS_144654] is given.  However, we rarely saw these reactions when VRC01 was given. When reactions were reported, they were u sually mild.  VRC01 given by [CONTACT_128195], redness and/or swelling at site of injection. These symptoms usually cleared within a few minutes to hours after the product was given. In an ongoing study, additional product injections were discontinued for one subject who developed mild chest discomfort and for one subject who developed mild rash that were associated with study product administration (VRC01 or placebo).  
We are giving VRC07 -523LS at a controlled rate.  If symptoms occur while VRC07- 523LS is being given, tell the nurse.  
Slowing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_100386].    
Some antibody products have a risk of serious allergic reactions that can be life -threatening.   
• Anaphylaxis is one type of allergic reaction that may happen soon after an antibody product is given.  This reaction 
can include difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, hives or rash, swelling in the mouth and face.  
• Serum sickness is a delayed type of allergic reaction that may happen several days to three weeks after an antibody product is given.  This reaction can include hives or rash, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, muscle pains, joint pains, chest discomfort and shortness of breath.   
Some antibodies of the type that attack human proteins can increase the risk of serious infections.  VRC07 -523LS is not 
expected to increase the risk of serious infections because it attacks a virus and not a human protein. 
In addition to the possible risks that are listed above, VRC07 -523LS may have other side effects that we do not know 
about yet.  Participation in this study may affect your eligibility for future monoclonal antibody studies.  We will give you  
any new information about risks or other information that becomes available that may affect your decision to continue in 
the study.  
Risks of Blood Drawing :  Blood drawing may cause pain and bruising and rarely, may cause a feeling of lightheadedness 
or fainting.  Rarely, it may cause infection at the site where the blood is taken.  In this study on the day of an infusion, an IV line may be placed in your vein and left for a few hours.  Problems at the IV site are usually mild and may include pain, bruising, minor swelling or bleeding.  Rarely, there may be an infection, vein irritation, or a bloo d clot.   
Risks of Oral Mucosa Sample Collection :  Collection of samples by [CONTACT_128205], rarely, a little bleeding.  
Risk of a False Positive HIV Antibody Test Caused by [CONTACT_33805]0 7-523LS:  An HIV antibody test is the usual way to test for HIV 
infection.  VRC01 and VRC07-523LS are antibodies against HIV.  Based on laboratory testing, VRC01 does not cause a 
positive HIV antibody test in standard diagnostic tests.  Since VRC07 -523LS is similar to VRC01, we expect that VRC07-
523LS does not cause a positive HIV antibody test.  However, we do not know yet if it will cause a positive HIV antibody test or not.  We will test for HIV antibodies at some visits.  If you ever need or wan t an HIV test while you are on the 
study, please ask the VRC Clinic to do the test.  We will tell you the results of your HIV test.  
Risks during Pregnancy :  We do not know what effects VRC07-523LS may have on a fetus or nursing infant.  Women who 
are able to have children must agree to not get pregnant during study participation.  We will discuss effective birth control 
methods with you.  
You must notify the clinic staff right away if you get pregnant during this study or think that you might be pregnant. I f 
you get pregnant, you will not get any more VRC07 -523LS administrations and we will not collect any more blood for 
research.  However, you will be asked to continue with study follow -up visits to check on your health and to report the 
outcome of the preg nancy to us, which will be reported to the antiretroviral pregnancy registry  (http://www.apregistry.com ).

The compensation is $175 for scheduled visits with blood drawing and oral swabs; $ [ADDRESS_144656] administration 
visit(s) that includes follow -up blood sample collections on the same day, and $ [ADDRESS_144657] administration visit(s) 
without follow -up sample collections on the same day.  Compensation for timely completion of all 3 days of an electronic 
diary will be $25 total.  Additional compensation for clinic visits that do not include research blood sample collection will be $75.  Tot al compensation for completion of the study is estimated to range from $ 2475 to $ [ADDRESS_144658] deposit into a bank account that you 
specify to the volunteer payment office.  Your compensation may need to be reported to the internal revenue service (IRS) as taxable income.  
REASONS FOR DISCONTINUING STUDY PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION OR REMOVING YOU FROM THE 
STUDY  
You may be stopped from getting VRC0 7-523LS for several different reasons, including:  
• You don't keep appointments or follow study procedures.  
• You get a serious illness that needs ongoing medical care.  
• You have a serious side effect thought to be due to VRC0 7-523LS.  
• You enroll in another research study at the same time you are in this study. 
• You become pregnant.  
• The study is stopped or canceled.  
A study may be stopped or canceled by a study sponsor, a regulatory agency or by [CONTACT_30967].  If this 
happens , we will tell you the reason why the study was stopped. 
You may choose to stop participating in the study at any time. If you got any doses of VRC0 7-523LS, you will be asked to 
keep follow -up visits so we can monitor your health. We may stop collecting sample s that  are for research purposes only .

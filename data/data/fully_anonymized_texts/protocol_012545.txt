There is general agreement that statin-treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) can increase the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in a small percentage of some individuals. This research proposal will study what metabolic characteristics and variables (for example high cholesterol or high triglycerides or both) will identify those people at highest risk of statin-induced T2DM.  We will evaluate how the medication atorvastatin (trade name [CONTACT_373242][INVESTIGATOR_17133]) works in regards to its effect on insulin action, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion to help us further understand the possible cause of the increased occurrences of T2DM in people who are at risk for T2DM.  Everyone will receive the same statin, Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133], at the same dose, [ADDRESS_467132] samples for integrated Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP), a monitoring approach developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Snyder and his research colleagues. This is described in detail on page [ADDRESS_467133]. Snyder's previous research on iPOP, we propose to analyze iPOP of individuals who participate in this study during and after taking the statin. In this study, we will analyze not only the previously-known drug's effectiveness but also untargeted drug's effectiveness, (other unknown benefits this medication may have) and drug effects such as those seen in some participants when given a statin. The hope then is to obtain a better understanding of how to perform a personal omics profile when taking drugs, which would lead to develop better use of drugs. You must sign this consent to participant in this study. A screening consent will be signed, or verbally agreed to before any screening procedures will be done.  VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION  Your participation in this study is voluntary.  Your decision not to participate will not have any negative effect on you or your medical care.  You can decide to participate now, but withdraw your consent later and stop being in the study without any loss of benefits or medical care to which you are entitled. Please let us know or call [CONTACT_373247] or one of his associates at [PHONE_7737] if you decide to withdraw from this study, we might ask you to come in for a final visit.

5  IRB USE ONLY Approval Date:   April 16, 2019 Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5952]: April 16, [ADDRESS_467140] – This test will be done at the beginning and end of the study.  You will be asked to fast for [ADDRESS_467141] (OGTT). The OGTT involves a series of blood samples taken before and during the 120 minutes after drinking a sweet cola drink which contains 50 -75 grams (5 tablespoons) of glucose (a form of sugar).  This test will be done after you have fasted for 12 hours from the previous evening.  An IV will be inserted in one of your arms for the purpose of drawing blood samples to determine your blood glucose (sugar) level during this procedure.  Blood samples will be drawn at time 0, 30, 60, [ADDRESS_467142] will be 45 ml (3 tablespoons).  The purpose of this procedure is to determine if you have a normal glucose tolerance response, impaired glucose tolerance (a mild abnormality of glucose disposal) or if you have diabetes and to calculate insulin secretion.   Although not common, some people may experience nausea when drinking the cola drink.   The results of this test will be discussed with you, and we will give you a copy. The total time for this procedure will take approximately [ADDRESS_467143] is designed to assess the ability of your pancreas gland to produce insulin in response to a glucose (sugar) infusion. During this test, you will have two small IV catheters (tubing) placed in your veins. One IV will be for blood drawing and the other for the infusion of glucose. You will be given glucose in specific amounts based on your weight and the glucose rate will be steadily increased over a 4-hour period. The amount of blood taken for this test will be equal to approximately 5 tablespoons (47.5 ml).  On rare occasions, the glucose can be irritating to the vein and may cause an achiness or redness in your arm.  If this happens let us know and we will either put a warm pack on the IV site or replace the IV to a new site. Although rare a side effect associated with having an IV some discomfort and carries a slight risk of infection, or bruising   INSULIN SENSITIVITY TEST- This test will be done at the beginning and end of the study.

6  IRB USE ONLY Approval Date:   April 16, 2019 Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5952]: April 16, [ADDRESS_467145] is designed to measure how well your cells remove glucose (a type of sugar) from your blood in response to insulin. This test will involve the infusion of glucose, insulin and octreotide (sandostatin) by [CONTACT_373231].   During this test you will have two small catheters (tubing) placed in your veins (I.V. lines).  One of these will be used for blood drawing and the other for giving the infusion of glucose, insulin and sandostatin.  Blood samples will be taken before, during and at the end of the infusion study. The total amount of blood that will be drawn from you during this study will be 59.5 ml of blood (approximately 4-5 tablespoons).   Insulin is a natural hormone, and sandostatin (a synthetic hormone) is a drug that temporarily blocks the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. There are no serious adverse effects from the brief use of sandostatin in this study.  However, there may be a transient (temporary) decrease in your pulse, and occasionally nausea and abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_373223] 5-10% of people.  There may also be a 5-10% chance of having abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_373224], which could occur several hours after the completion of the study.    Insulin will cause your cells to remove glucose from your blood. It is possible that your blood glucose levels could become too low (hypoglycemia) during and immediately after the end of the study. In order to avoid this from occurring, your blood glucose levels will be measured during and after the study, and glucose will be given as needed to prevent hypoglycemia from occurring.  There is the risk of fever and sudden fall in blood pressure if the infusate solutions (substances given in your vein) are contaminated.  However, the solutions are made from sterile components or substances tested for sterility before being used in the preparation of the solutions, and the risk of contamination is very slight. This test will be 6 hours in length  After completing these tests, you will be given the study medication Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133] 40 mg which you will take once a day for 2 months and will stop after completing the end of study tests.   POTENTIAL MEDICATION SIDE EFFECTS and POSSIBLE RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES  Atorvastatin  You will receive atorvastatin (Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133]) 40 mg to be taken once a day.    Side Effects:  Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_373225]. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence equal to or greater than 2%) in patients treated with atorvastatin 40 mg in placebo (no medication) -controlled trials regardless of causality were: nasopharyngitis, (inflammation of nasal passage and sore throat) - 7%, arthralgia (pain in joints) -10.6%, diarrhea -14.1 %, pain in extremity - 9.3%, and urinary tract infection 8.0%.

Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown and kidney failure) have been reported with Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_373226]. A history of kidney impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis.  People with kidney disease will not qualify for this study. The risk of myopathy, and in rare cases rhabdomyolysis, during treatment with statins is increased when taking certain medications.  These include: cyclosporine, certain medications to lower triglycerides (fibric acid derivatives, or niacin), some antibiotics such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, certain medications for treating HIV or hepatitis C, or strong antifungal medications known as azole antifungals phosphokinase.  It is important to let us know all medications you are taking whether prescribed or over the counter and any new medications you may be prescribed while you are participating in this study. Although very rare, another side effect is elevated liver enzymes which may cause symptoms of feeling tired or weak, loss of appetite, stomach pain, dark urine (dark brownish orange) or yellowing of the skin or whites of your eyes. Individuals who are on the medications listed above or have certain diagnoses as noted above will not qualify for this study.  Please let your healthcare provider know you are taking Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133].  It can also cause muscle tenderness or weakness, and study participants should be advised to report immediately unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if in addition you have fatigue or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133].   Other Cholesterol Lowering Medications While on the study medication you will not be able to take any other statins or cholesterol lowering medications such as niacin, fibrates, ezetimibe, bile acid binding resins or over the counter herbs such as red yeast rice which has the similar cholesterol lowering effects.  It is advised not to drink grapefruit juice when taking a statin.   Contraindications: These study medications are not recommended for people with any of the following: a known hypersensitive or allergy to statins, previous intolerance to all statins, severe kidney or liver disease.

Research using blood samples is an important way to try and understand human disease.  Blood samples may be stored for future research and testing in the field of insulin resistance and the relationship between early events for the development of atherogenesis (blockages in arteries) or type [ADDRESS_467150]; otherwise your identity will not be disclosed.   Because there is no absolute protection against discrimination on the basis of disease or genetic information, the investigator will use the results of this study as research only and it will not be included in your medical records. Because this is a research study the information we learn from this study or any future testing will not be reported directly to you.  There is no risk of not knowing this information as you will already be given current information regarding insulin resistance and heart disease risks and advised on methods to modify insulin resistance and your risk factors for coronary artery disease as it pertains to you.   If for some reason you are unable to continue in the study we will keep the blood samples obtained from your baseline studies. Any tissues you have donated which are used in research may result in new products, tests or discoveries. In some instances, these may have potential commercial value and may be developed and owned by [CONTACT_32366], Stanford University and/or others.  However, donors of tissues do not retain any property rights to the materials.  Therefore, you would not share in any financial benefits from these products, tests or discoveries.  If you do not want to grant permission to save your samples after the completion of analysis for this study let us know now or at the completion of your participation. You understand you have the right to withdraw your consent to save your blood after the completion of analysis now or at any time and this will not affect your ability to participate in the research study.  _____Yes:  I consent to my samples being saved for future research  _____No:  I do not consent to my samples being saved for future research  iPOP samples  We will perform iPOP analysis on the samples collected, including genomic (including whole genome sequencing, this tells us your DNA sequence and some of your genetic disposition to diseases, as well as the DNA sequence of the microbes in your nasal, tongue and skin surface swab, saliva, urine and stool samples), epi[INVESTIGATOR_141214] (this shows how genes are regulated at the DNA level), transcriptomic (this informs us how genes are expressed at the RNA level), proteomic (this allows us to know the details of all the

As part of this study, we will collect your name, medical history, sample related records, results of your physical examinations and answers to questionnaires.  We will also record your iPOP profiles (including genomic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_141214], transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomics, autoantibodyomic as well as integrative profiles) that we generate in our research lab. All participants for this study will be anonymized (unidentified) and assigned to a coded ID number and only the core personnel of the study will have access to the key. Data may also be looked at by [CONTACT_373232], including the Institutional Review Board (IRB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or the federal Office for Human Research Protections   TISSUE SAMPLING FOR GENETIC TESTING iPOP As part of the analysis on your samples, the investigators will do genetic testing. Genetic research is research that studies genes, including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by [CONTACT_373233]. Genetic research may include looking at information, such as personal appearance and biochemistry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family medical histories, reactions to medications and responses to treatment. Genetic research raises certain questions about informing you of any results. Possible risks of knowing results include: anxiety; other psychological distress; and the possibility of insurance and job discrimination. A possible risk of not knowing includes being unaware of the need for treatment. These risks can change depending on the results of the research and whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease. The iPOP information is for research purposes only and will not be released to you.   Your DNA sample and information will be kept in a secured place in [CONTACT_373249]’s laboratory at the Alway Building of the Stanford University School of Medicine, or another site until it is used up or destroyed. The banked DNA may be used in future studies of genetic factors related to health and disease.   Sometimes patients have been required to furnish information from genetic testing for health insurance, life insurance, and/or a job. A Federal law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers with [ADDRESS_467151] you based on your genetic information.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has established a national database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP) that wasdeveloped to archive and distribute the results of studies that have investigated the interaction of genotypes and phenotypes. These studies include genome-wide association studies, medical sequencing, molecular diagnostic assays, as well as association between genotype and non-clinical traits. dbGaP provides two levels of

Controlled-access data can only be obtained with authorization by [CONTACT_373234] (DAC) and includes de-identified genotype and phenotype information. Your tissues contain genes which are made of DNA that is unique to you. Coded information about you may be sent to this national database. Access will be controlled and limited to other researchers.   If you agree we would also like to make your genetic data accessible to the public. In this case, your name [CONTACT_373243], but the results of sequencing and other biological assays will be available. There is the possibility that you could be identified through your genome sequence which means others could have access to your genetic information.   Please note that even in the secure database, there is a risk of breach of confidentiality. When data are stored electronically, there is also a risk of breach of computer security. Since you and your relatives and other members of your ethnic group share some of the same genetic make-up, there is a small chance for breach of their privacy, as well.   While we believe that the risks to you and your family are very low, we are unable to tell you exactly what all of the risks are. We believe that the benefits of learning more about diseases outweigh these potential risks.   Psychological or social risks associated with loss of privacy:  • Although your genetic information is unique to you, you do share some genetic information with your children, parents, brothers, sisters, and other blood relatives. Consequently, it may be possible that genetic information from them could be used to help identify you. Similarly, it may be possible that genetic information from you could be used to help identify them.  • While neither the public nor controlled-access databases developed for this project will contain information that is traditionally used to identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number, or social security number, people may develop ways in the future that would allow someone to link your genetic information in our databases with information from you (or a blood relative) in another database and be able to identify you (or a blood relative). It also is possible that there could be violations to the security of the computer systems used to store codes linking your genetic and medical information to you.  • Since some genetic variations can help to predict the future health problems of you and your relatives, this information might be of interest to employers, health providers, insurance companies, and others. Patterns of genetic variation can also be used by [CONTACT_373235] a person or his/her blood relatives. Therefore, your genetic information potentially could be used in ways that could cause you or your family distress, such as by [CONTACT_373236] (or a blood relative) carry a genetic disease or by [CONTACT_373237] (or a blood relative).  • There may be other privacy risks that we have not foreseen.

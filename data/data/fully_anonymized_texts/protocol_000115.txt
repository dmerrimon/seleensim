million (1 in 5) American adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.1 DIC are characterized by [CONTACT_728596], infringe on the rights of others, violate social norms, 
and result in conflicts with authority figures.2 For these adolescents, behavioral health care is complex, long- term, 
and requires parental participation.3-5 Research by [CONTACT_728597]’ care.6-[ADDRESS_995053]  biases and limited skills  and confidence to  communicate with these parents  to encourage  them to voice their 
concerns and care preferences.9-12 Low income and/or minority parents are at greatest risk for not being involved 
in their adolescents’ behavioral health care, having poor interactions with providers, being more likely to perceive poor quality of their adolescents’ behavioral health care, and having low treatment engagement.
13-18 If 
unaddressed,  poor  parent -provider  interactions  interfere with  adoles cents’  retention  in behavioral  health  care.19,[ADDRESS_995054] targeted both parents and providers to optimize their interactions and 
improve behavioral health care for adolescents with DIC.3,21 
To address these problems, we propose modifying the evidence -based DECIDE intervention to target low 
income and/or minority parents and providers of adolescents with DIC. DECIDE stands for Decide the problem; 
Explore the questions; Closed or open- ended questions; Identify the who, why, or how of the problem; Direct 
questions to your health care professional; Enjoy a shared solution. DECIDE was developed for ethnically/racially 
diverse adult patients with serious mental illness,[ADDRESS_995055] evidence -based iterations include intervention 
com ponents targeted to and shown to increase patient activation, provider communication, and patient -provider 
interactions.22 DECIDE has two primary components: 1) three patient training sessions designed to help patients 
effectively ask  questions  and partici pate in  decisions about care:  and 2) a  12-hour workshop and up to  [ADDRESS_995056] disorders (DIC), especially those in low 
income and/or minority families, present some of the nation’s most pressing behavioral health care challenges. Five million (1 in 5) adolescents 12- 17 years of age are diagnosed with a DIC that includes the following DSM -5 
diagnoses: (a) Oppositional Defiant Disorder, (b) Conduct Disorder, (c) Intermittent Explosive Disorder, (d) Pyromania, (e) Kleptomania,  (f) Other  Specified  DIC Disorder,  and (g) Unspecified  DIC.
1,2,26 DIC are characterized  by 
[CONTACT_728598], infringe on the 
rights of others, violate social norms, and result in conflicts with authority figures.2 Annual medical costs average  
$14,[ADDRESS_995057]  Disorder  compared  to < $[ADDRESS_995058] 
medical costs range from $17 to 56 billion for those with DIC.27-29 Parents incur financial costs associated with 
interruptions in employment due to caregiving responsibilities, increased healthcare needs for their own stress - 
related  illnesses,  and their  child’s  treatment.30-33 Approximately  57%  of children  with  mental  health  disorders, 
including DIC, come from households living at or below the federal poverty level,34 and low income and/or 
minority parents are particularly vulnerable to the negativ e effects of caregiving for adolescents with these 
DECIDE  Parent -Provider  Interaction  
IRB Protocol   
disorders.18,35- 37 Problems  associated  with  DIC are exacerbated  during  adolescence  due to rapid  developmental 
changes and increased substance abuse and criminal activities.38 
The effective tr eatment of adolescents with DIC depends on their parents’ active engagement with 
behavioral health care providers.39,40 In addition to managing their adolescents’  problem behaviors  and their own 
distress over such behaviors,31,32,36,41,[ADDRESS_995059] ions with providers contribute to parent disengagement from their 
adolescents’ care and resistance to following provider recommendations, both of which lead to poor adolescent 
outcomes.49,50 
 
Low income and/or minority parents of adolescents with DIC are a t high risk for aversive interactions 
with providers due to socioeconomic disadvantages.32,51,52 Research has shown that effective communication  
skills deployed by [CONTACT_728599], such as asking informed questions and clearly articulati ng 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_728574], are associated with greater satisfaction with care and better health outcomes.53-57 However, 
low income and/or minority persons often have less opportunity to acquire these skills due to low educational 
attainment, poor health litera cy, disadvantaged social position, and limited resources.47,58- 60 Negative interactions 
are fostered by [CONTACT_728600]/or minority health consumers to be uninvolved, 
uniformed,  and unable  to make complex  health  care  decisions,8,19,47,61,62 and lack of training  about  how  to motivate 
low income and/or minority persons to voice treatment concerns and preferences. 18,59,60,63- 65 
Scientific  Premise:  To address  the above  issues,  research  suggests  appropriate  target  variables  for 
parents and providers are parent activation, provider communication, and parent -provider interactions.  
Activation is a person’s acquisition of knowledge, skills, and beliefs that facilitate active participation in health care.
66,67 High activation in a dult patients with chronic illness,68-77 such as diabetes,78 HIV/AIDS,79 hypertension;[ADDRESS_995060]  been  shown  to improve:  1) parent  
knowledge and management of their children and adolescents’ behavior problems;91-98 2) parent mental health 
and stress levels;93,94,99 and 3) parent self -efficacy in accessing and navigating adolescents’ mental health 
services.100,[ADDRESS_995061] demonstrated that patient 
activation  in the absence  of provider  support  can lead  to harmful  effects,  including further  exacerbation  of tension 
in patient - provider relationships or diminished patient use of ser vices particularly in low income and/or minority 
patients.23 Patients’ perception or belief that the provider is supportive (receptive) of the former’s efforts to be 
actively involved in treatment may act as a mediator of intervention effects.22,23 Alegria  and colleagues suggested 
that patients’ beliefs that providers will support their activation efforts may significantly contribute to benefits of 
patient -provider interactions, patient perception of management of care, perceived quality of care, and 
engage ment and retention in care.23 
Our proposed focus  on both  parents  and providers  is innovative  in this field.  In DIC and other  mental 
health  disorders,  there are several  support  programs  or interventions  targeting parents.  However,  there are no 
(zero) interventions targeting providers, and no interventions targeting both parents and providers. This was 
confirmed in a PubMed search of all existing English -language literature using terms “parent, mental health,  
activation  or empowerment,  and intervention”.  
DECIDE  Parent -Provider  Interaction  
IRB Protocol   
 
Our target variables are innovative in this field. Improving parent activation improves interactions with 
providers 17,21,[ADDRESS_995062] tested parent activation interventions in adolescent behavioral 
healt h care.102,103 These two studies102,103 showed positive effects on parent activation and perceived efficacy to 
work with mental health providers.104 However, neither study intervened with providers. Similarly, improving 
provider  communication  increases  satisfaction, adherence,  and health  outcomes,86,87 Yet there are no such  existing 
interventions for parents of children with DIC. This was confirmed in a PubMed search of all existing English - 
language literature using terms “parent -  provider co mmunication, mental health, and intervention. Provider 
communication interventions have been developed to improve encounters between healthcare providers and 
adult patients with physical health concerns,58,105,[ADDRESS_995063] intervention to improve interactions 
between par ents and providers of adolescents with DIC.  
 
Our inclusion of low income and/or minority parents addresses an understudied population. The 
existing parent  activation  intervention  studies  focused  on military  families102,109 or Latino  parents.104 The military 
sample was majority  white  (73%)  and middle  income.  Our study will include  a more racial/ethnic diverse sample.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_995064] the DECIDE intervention (referred to as 
DECIDE from now on) for parents and providers of adolescents with DIC. In phase I, our team in Indianapolis, IN (Drs. Oruche, Draucker, Perkins, parent and provider advi sory boards) will work with two consultants to modify 
DECIDE. [CONTACT_728620] will help modify the DECIDE provider components to be relevant for DIC. [CONTACT_728621] will help 
modify DECIDE from patient to parent focused. In phase II, we will test modified DECIDE ag ainst usual care in 
parents and providers of adolescents with DIC using a two -group, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], randomized, controlled design. During 
phase II, [CONTACT_728622] became a Co -Investigator at the University of South [LOCATION_012] in Tampa, FL.  [CONTACT_728621] (New 
York, NY) has c linical expertise in improving activation among parents of adolescents with DIC. [CONTACT_728620] 
(Northampton,  MA)  led the design  and implementation  of DECIDE  components  targeted  to providers
25 [CONTACT_728621] 
will help modify DECIDE from patient to parent focused. Our setting is a large, safety net health system in the 
Indianapolis metropolitan area servicing primarily low income and/or minority persons.  
Specific  aims  are to: 
 
Phase  I, Aim 1. Modify  DECI DE for low income  and/or  minority  parents  and providers  of adolescents  with  DIC. 
 
Phase  II, Aim 2. Evaluate  the feasibility  and acceptability  of modified  DECIDE.  
 
Phase  II, Aim 3. Estimate  preliminary  effects  of modified  DECIDE  to improve parent,  provider,  and adolescent 
outcomes. We hypothesize that compared to usual care:  
 
Hypothesis  3.1. Modified  DECIDE  parents  will show  greater  improvements  in: 1) activation;  2) parent - 
provider interactions; 3) perceived management of adolescents’ behavioral h ealth care, 4) perceived  
quality  of adolescents’  behavioral  health  care,  and 5) engagement  in adolescents’  behavioral  health  care. 
Hypothesis 3.2. Modified DECIDE providers will show greater improvements in: 1) communication skills 
and 2) parent -provider interactions.  
Hypothesis  3.3. Adolescents  of modified  DECIDE  parents  and providers  will show  higher  rates  of retention 
in behavioral health care.  
 
If study findings are positive, we will be poised to test the modified DECIDE in a fully -powered R01 level 
randomized, controlled, multi -site clinical trial. If study findings are negative, we will have process and outcome 
information  needed  to further  refine DECIDE  or pursue  different  interventions.  Either  way,  this line of research  has 
potential to optimize parent -provider interactions and ultimately, ensure adolescents with DIC receive the 
behavioral health care they need.

No providers  or parents  will be excluded  on basis  of race/ethnicity,  gender,  or sexual  orientation.  
 
5.0 Enrollment/Randomization 
Screening  
Providers  currently  employed  at Sandra  Eskenazi  Mental  Health  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Bowen  Center,  Centerstone,  and 
other applicable mental health ce nters or  private practice will be approached for inclusion on the  study.  Providers 
with at least one patient who is aged between 6 -17 and diagnosed with DIC disorders will be screened for 
enrollment.  
 
Informed Consent  
 
A study investigator  or research  assistant  will obtain  informed  consent  from the provider  either  via a 
HIPPA compliant teleconferencing platform (ie Zoom Health) or via telephone contact. Parents who become  
DECIDE  Parent -Provider  Interaction

enrolled  will be approached  via telephone  contact.  Informed  consent  for parents  will be obtained  virtually  via a 
HIPPA compliant telecon ferencing platform (i.e., Zoom Health) or telephone contact.  
Randomization  
 
All participants  will be assigned  to the intervention  arm and there will be no randomization.  Instead,  the 
intervention results will be compared to historical data.  
 
Study  Duration/Timeline  
 
The study will consist  of the provider  completing baseline  measures  and then  complete a 4.5 hours  (max) 
workshop  through Canvas  Learning  System,  completed  over  the course  of 2-3 weeks.  After  the provider  completes 
the workshop, he/she will be contact[CONTACT_728601] -intervention measures (T2) and 
conduct a recorded qualitative interview.  The parents will complete baseline (T1) study measures  before meeting 
with the parent trainer.  Then all will participate in up to three,  hour -long sessions training sessions with a parent 
trainer. In total, participation in the study will last between 6- 8 weeks.  
 
6.0 Study  Procedures  
 
1. Theoretical Framework. DECIDE is grounded in mental health disparities f rameworks113, 24 and social 
cognitive principles.114 The parent component is designed to increase parent activation, to help effectively ask 
questions  and participate  in decisions  about  care.23,112 66,111 The provider  component  is designed  to teach  provider 
communication  skills  in listening,  eliciting the patient’s  agenda, encouraging question,  and providing  management 
education.  
2. Preliminary Studies. Drs. Oruche, Draucker, Perkins, and Chacko collaborated on the preliminary 
studies  below.  For this application,  we added [CONTACT_728620]  (Consultant)  who  is a nationally  recognized  researcher 
and clinician with expertise in racial/ethnic disparities related to provider level factors. Our preliminary work is 
below.  
 
Preliminary study 1. Through this qualitative descriptive study (internal funding), Drs. Oruche and 
Draucker  identified  the most  salient  needs  and challenges  of parents  of adolescents  with  DIC. Results  indicated  
that parents’  interactions  with  providers  were often  aversive,  stressful,  and nonproductive;  suggesting need  for an 
intervention.7,[ADDRESS_995066] an intervention called FAME (Family Management Efficacy) for parents of adolescents with DIC. With funding 
(KL2TR001106, UL1TR001108), Oruche, Dra ucker, Chacko and a parent and provider advisory board, developed 
and tested  this 6-week  parent  group -based,  in-person  intervention  among  low income  African  American  parents  of 
adolescents with DIC aimed at enhancing parent activation and improving interac tions with behavioral health care 
providers.[ADDRESS_995067] a provider component. Facilitators noted 
some parents  struggled  to develop  effective communication  skills  (e.g.,  asking  questions  of providers,  sharing  ideas 
about the adolescents’ treatments). The team gained valuable experience in intervention delivery to parents of 
adolescents with DIC and co nfirmed the importance of simultaneously targeting providers. These lessons inform 
modification of the evidence- based DECIDE intervention in this proposed study.117 
Preliminary  work for this application.  Drs. Oruche,  Draucker,  and Perkins  collaborated  with  Drs. Nakash 
([ADDRESS_995068]  3 months) and Chacko ([ADDRESS_995069]  3 months), on  the following components of this  application: 
identification of target variables for the modified DECIDE, creation of the study conceptual model, selection of study measures, and overall study design.  
 
3. Methods  
DECIDE  Parent -Provider  Interaction  
IRB Protocol   
 
DECIDE Intervention . The evidence- based DECIDE intervention was developed for low income and/or 
minority adults with serious mental illness and their providers.22 DECIDE has both patient and provider 
components. DECIDE has improved patient activation,23,24 patient self- management,23 perceived quality of 
care,23and improved  collaborative  treatment  decision  making.22 Because DECIDE  was designed  for individuals  who 
work with adult patients, we wil l adapt it for parents and providers of adolescents with DIC. For example, case 
examples need to be relevant to the clinical work with this population and accommodate individual or family 
therapy; we will also shorten the provider training –  to increase feasibility of implementation and acceptability to 
participants. This fits with Stage 1A and 1B of the ORBIT model.[ADDRESS_995070]  parent  and provider  components.  
The parent  component  is designed  to teach  parents  how  to effectively  ask questions  and participate  in 
decisions  about  their  adolescents’  behavioral  health  care.  It will include  up to three 60 minutes  sessions (the third 
session is optional). Session 1 (Decisions and Agency) is designed to increase awareness of t heir role in clinical 
interactions and encourage participation and decision making in care. Session 2 (Self -efficacy and Consolidation) 
encourages parents to ask questions about their adolescents’ behavioral health and health care and treatment options . S ession 3Optional Booster), which can discuss any previous topi[INVESTIGATOR_728575]).  
The provider component is designed to improve provider communication in three key areas:  1) 
perspective taking to understand circumstances and perceptions; 2) attributional errors or attributing negative parent behaviors to character traits instead of considering the situational factors; and 3) receptivity to parent participation  and collaboration.  We will shorten  the provider  training to increase  feasibility  of implementation  and 
acceptability to participants. The  training will included one 4.5- hour (rather than 12 -hour) group workshop.  
  
 
Intervention Delivery. In addition to standard care, all participants  will receive the modified DECIDE. 
Parents receiving intervention will receive up to three 60 -minute sessions over the course of three weeks. The 
sessions will focus on increasing the par ent’s involvement in decision -making, increasing their understanding of 
the decision -making  process,  and training the parents  to ask questions  concerning their  adolescent’s  care.  These 
training sessions will be delivered by [CONTACT_728602] a HIPPA compliant video teleconferencing 
platform (ie Zoom Health) or via Telephone as approved by [CONTACT_1744].  
Phase  I, Aim [ADDRESS_995071] to guide 
modification of DECIDE. Inclusion Cri teria. Midtown Child and Adolescent Program staffs who do not meet the 
inclusion  criteria  in phase  II (i.e. manager  and clinical  coordinators  or supervisors). We will invite  two other  direct 
care providers who work in the healthcare system but not at recruitment site. No parent or provider will be 
excluded on basis of race/ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.  
 
DECIDE Modification.  [CONTACT_728622]  has met  both  [CONTACT_728620]  and Midtown  Chief Executive Officer, Program 
manager and clinical coordinators to discus s potential modifications to the provider intervention to increase 
acceptability and feasibility. We will invite their continued participation during phase I. The research team and 
provider advisory board will  meet monthly for  ~ 3 months to modify the  intervention.  At the  initial meeting,  the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_728576].  The research  team will prepare  the modified  
DECIDE  Parent -Provider  Interaction  
IRB Protocol   
intervention materials and present modifications to the provider advisory group for iterative feedback. The same 
process  will be followed  to modify  the parent  component  of the DECIDE  intervention.  Together,  research  team and 
the parents’ advisory group wil l meet twice during the first 4 -months of study period. We will (a) share the parent 
component of the DECIDE intervention, (b) discuss what components need to be modified, (c) have the team do the modifications; and (d) present them back to the parent advi sory group for iterative feedback.  
 
Phase  II, Aims  [ADDRESS_995072] publicly funded ment al 
health  center  in Indiana  and serves  primarily  low income  and/or  minority  population  (see Facilities  and Resources). 
Child and Adolescent Program employs 22 masters -prepared mental health providers. Oruche  also has clinical 
privileges at Midtown to  facilitate recruitment (see support letter). Midtown has  named  treatment engagement  as 
a top strategic priority.  
Sample. First, we will recruit 16 providers and then work with them to invite parents (or parent 
surrogates)  of adolescents  aged  [ADDRESS_995073]  been  diagnosed  with  a DIC disorder. Ideally,  we will enroll 
80 parents (5 parents per enrolled provider).  
 
Sample size justification. Because this is a feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], statistical models will be fit to estimate 
effect  sizes  for use in a future  randomized  trial.  Any inferential  testing  is considered  exploratory  though effect  sizes 
of ≥0.65 could be detected with 80% power in the models described below assuming pre/post exposure  
correlation of  0.5, intraclass  correlation of  5%, and two -tailed test  (α=0.05).  We will  follow the recommendation  of 
Hertzog
119 that a minimum of 30 participants per group are needed for pi[INVESTIGATOR_728577].119 To account for potential 20% dropout, we will recruit 40 parents to the intervention group with 1 - 
5 parents per provider) for up to a total of 80 parents. Provider sample size is based on availability.  
 
Procedures. Enrollment, consent, and baseline data collection. Providers . PI [INVESTIGATOR_728578], answer questions, and invite them to participate. Trained research assistants (RA) will obtain verbal informed consent from interested providers. Parents. To screen parents, we will 
enlist the help of providers and administrative assistants at the clinic, who have access to providers’ caseloads, 
schedules, and adolescent patient demographics. To coordinate recruitment, we will ask the administrative 
assistants to select  adolescents  between  6 to 17 years  who  are diagnosed  with  DIC. PI [INVESTIGATOR_728579]’ next visit . Parent eligibility and consent to participate will be determined 
by [CONTACT_728603] a HIPPA compliant teleconferencing platform (ie Zoom Health). If RA does not make  contact  [CONTACT_728604],  RA will send  study  flyer  and recruitment  letter  co-signed  by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_728580]. RA will make follow -up contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_995074]  baseline  data  from all providers  and parents.. Training for 
providers will occur as soon after baseline measures are collected.

Data collection . A trained study staff will collect baseline data (T1)  before the provider takes the DECIDE 
Training and will schedule a follow -up assessment [ADDRESS_995075] intervention training (T2). Providers will be 
instruc ted to think specifically about the most recent therapy session that he/she had with a parent of a child 
diagnosed with DIC in order to keep the parent provider interaction fresh in the provider’s mind when completing 
the measures.  Study staff will follow these same guidelines for scheduling the T2 data collection. Providers will 
complete and enter their surveys directly into REDCap.  Providers will be contact[CONTACT_728605].  Study staff will schedule  an appointment  with 
providers to collect the post -intervention (T2) measures in order to ensure the provider understands the 
instructions and also to conduct the post -intervention qualitative interview. Providers will b e instructed to  think 
specifically about the most recent therapy session that he/she had with a parent of a child diagnosed with DIC in order  to keep  the parent  provider  interaction  fresh  in the provider’s  mind  when  completing  the measures.  Parents

Measures.  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_995076] coordinator will keep logs and field notes of feasibility including: 1) 
enrollment  rates,  reasons  for ineligibility  and declining participation;  2) attrition  rate,  reasons  for missed  session  or 
intervention completion; and (3) measurement completion rates. We will measure parent and provider 
acceptability and satisfaction with modified DECIDE using Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) and in -depth 
semi structured interviews at T2. RAs under  Draucker’s supervision will conduct in -depth semi -structured 
interviews  including:  All intervention  providers  (n = 8) and two of each  of the parents  (n = 16). To explore  different 
levels of acceptability by [CONTACT_3654], for each provider, one parent will be chosen who has a high score (> 3) on the CSQ and one parent who has a low score (< 3). Both parents and providers will be asked about their experience 
with the intervention, what was helpful or not, and how they would change the intervention.  
 
Aim 3 measures . Parents,  providers,  and adolescents’  socio -demographic  factors  will be assessed  at T1; 
and outcomes will be assessed at T1 and T2.  We will include three items (i.e., level of parent organization,  
involvement,  and management  of adolescents’  care)  from  the Child  and Adolescent  Needs  and Strengths  (CANS) at 
Midtown’s request. We will use self- administered questionnaires with read- aloud procedures to address issues of 
literacy. All measures have well -established psychometric properties, sensitivity to change, and acceptable 
response burden.

school’s Center for Continuing Education and Lifelong Learning to offer the CE credits at minimal cost. Providers 
will also receive $100 upon completion of the T1 measures, the DECIDE Workshop, T2 measures and the 
qualitative interview i f located at any center that is not Bowen or Eskenazi.  
 
Intervention Fidelity. W e will follow the treatment fidelity protocols developed for the original DECIDE 
trial and the NIH Treatment Fidelity Workgroup recommendations to ensure intervention integrity and minimize drift/group contamination.
128 Design. We are comparing an historical control data to intervention data gathered 
during the study.. Provider training. All study personnel will receive training specific to their role; regular 
supervision and retraining as needed. We will fully manualize the modified intervention similar to  the original 
DECIDE intervention with standardized treatment protocols, training manuals, and training content,25,129,[ADDRESS_995081] of key intervention 
components. Receipt and Enactment of Treatment. Facilitators for parent component will complete a session - 
specific field  note  entry  that summarizes  parent  responses  (i.e.,  level  of engagement  and understanding)  and any 
potential external factors (e.g., interruptions, noise) that may have influenced their response.  
7.0 Reporting  of Adverse  Events  
Participants  will be monitored for adverse events on  a daily basis.  Any adverse events  will be reported to 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_728581].  The research  investigative  team will be responsible  for data  and safety  of this 
study and include Ukamaka Oruche, PhD, RN (Co -I)); Claire Draucker, PhD, RN (Co -I), Susan Perkins, PhD (PI), Ora  

DECIDE  Parent -Provider  Interaction  
IRB Protocol   
Nakash  (Consultant),  and Anil Chacko (Consultant).  In addition  to monthly research  team meetings,  the committee 
will meet as  soon as possible following the occurrence of any adverse events.  
Data. Parents and providers (participants) in this study will be assigned a participant identification 
number (PIN). Research materials such as parent and provider interviews will contain the PIN instead of the 
participants’ names. A file containing a link betwe en the PIN and the participants’ names will be created and 
access  to this file will be restricted  to key research  staff such as the Project coordinator  and only  for the purpose  of 
scheduling interviews. All research staff will be required to complete train ing in Human Subjects protection 
sponsored  by [CONTACT_728607].  This includes  basic human subjects’  protection 
and advanced training on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPA) and Conflict of Interest. The 
staff will also receive additional training on working with participants or handling identifying information.  
 
After obtaining cons ent from the parent, the research team will access their administrative data, and 
parent interviews for purposes of this study.  Once at research team offices at the university offices, all documents 
that include  identifying  information  (i.e. names,  address es and telephone  numbers)  will immediately  be separated 
from the parent  assessments,  and recordings.  These  items  will be stored  by [CONTACT_728608] [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a 
locked file and an identifying case number will be generated. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_728582]/or any information or files that link the case number with any parent identifying information. No reports will be made public using any names or identifying information. R aw 
data  and accompanying  research  protocols  will be kept  for at least  [ADDRESS_995082]  (research  staff and/or  patient)  and subsequent  clinical judgment. 
Both provider and parent participants will have several phone numbers to call should they have any concerns or questions about any aspect of the study, including contact [CONTACT_728609], the project coordinator, the IRB offices, and the parent/patient representatives at Midtown. All other adverse events will be reported annually 
with the continuing review. Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation. Taking part in the study is voluntary. A participant 
may choose not to take part in the study or to withdraw from the study at any time. If the participant withdraws 
from the study, he/she will not be penalized in any way and will not lose any benefits he/she is entitled. The participant may choose to contact [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_728583], or he/she may simply choose to stop coming 
to the study sessions. If the participant chooses to withdraw, a study representative will call the participant to 
make  sure  he/she  is ok. The study representative will provide  the participant  with  contact  [CONTACT_728610]. For example, parents may be provided number to other Midtown programs or National Alliance on 
Mental Illness (NAMI) Indianapolis. In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_728584].

8.0 Study  Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
After  signing the informed  consent,  participants  can withdraw  and leave the study at any time.  Members  
of the study team will assist participants in withdrawing if that is the wish of the participant.  Withdrawing from  
the study will not impact  the participant’s  healthcare  in any way.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_995083] 4 on the 5 -point scale 
(satisfied or highly satisfied). Effect sizes will be estimated by [CONTACT_728611], with parent, provider, or 
observer target and outcomes variables, all measured at T2, as outcomes and treatment group (intervention or usual care) as the explanatory variable. All models will also include the T1 outcome as a covariate and random 
effects  for provider  and parent  nested  within  provider  to account  for clustering.  Effects  sizes  will be estimated  with 
ω2. Analyses will be intent -to-treat and conducted using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, N.C., Copyright 
2002- 2012).  
Supplementary Analyses : We will investigate how the adjustment for covariates (age of child, sex of 
provider  and parent,  parent  race  and income,  severity  of child  illness  and duration  in treatment)  impacts  effect  size 
estimates by [CONTACT_728612] (e.g. male a nd female for parent gender). Missing Data : We will compare baseline variables between 
subjects who drop out of the study to those who do not using two -sample t tests, chi -square tests or their non-  
parametric  equivalents  as appropriate.  If we find that the missing  data  appear  to be MNAR,  this information  will be 
used in designing the larger trial. Because of the relatively small sample size, we will not attempt to model the 
missing data mechanism in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Sex as a biological variable: As noted above, we will estimate effect sizes by [CONTACT_728613]. Draucker will lead the qualitative analysis of the semi -structured interviews with  
input from PI [INVESTIGATOR_30496]. The interviews will be coded with standard content analytic procedures.

10.0 Privacy/Confidentiality  
A secure web -based system (REDCap) will be used to capture study data.  Participation in this research is 
covered  by a Certificate  of Confidentiality  from the National  Institutes  of Health.  The researchers  may  not disclose 
or use any information, document, or specimens that could identify any participants in any civil, criminal, 
administrative, legislative, or other legal proceeding, unless participant consents to it.

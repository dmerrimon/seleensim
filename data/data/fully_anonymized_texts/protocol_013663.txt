Title  
A randomized controlled study to assess SARS CoV -2 infection, viral shedding, 
and subsequent potential transmission in individuals immunized with Moderna 
COVID -19 Vaccine  
Primary objective(s)  
Primary objective 1:  
To evaluate the efficacy of Moderna COVID -[ADDRESS_505195] SARS -CoV -2 
infection (ie, to evaluate vaccine efficacy against infection or VE S) 
Primary objective 2:  
To evaluate the effect of Moderna COVID -[ADDRESS_505196]  and route of administration  
Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine : a lipid nanoparticle ( LNP ) dispersion of a 
messenger ribonucleic aci d (mRNA ) encoding the prefusion stabilized S protein 
of SARS -CoV -2 formulated in LNPs composed of 4 lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (1 proprietary and 3 
comme rcially available). The Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine , also known as 
mRNA -1273, is a suspension for intramuscular injection admi nistered as a series 
of two doses (0.5 mL each) 1 month apart.  
This vaccine has been issued an Emergency  Use Authorization ( EUA ) by [CONTACT_170055] (FDA) for active immunization to prevent 
COVID -19 in individuals 18 years and older .

virus that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID -19]) of any nation in the 
world  (1). Fortunately, there is now hope that the large burden of COVID -19-
related illnes s may lessen in 2021 due to the discovery that candidate  COVID -19 
vaccines, including the Moderna  COVID -19 Vaccine , can prevent symptomatic 
COVID -19 and severe disease in adults  (2, 3) . Ongoing  Phase 3  trials are n ot 
designed  to estimate a vaccine’s efficacy against all infection s, with a cri tical gap 
being asymptomatic infections . The current trials are also  not designed to evaluate 
vaccine effects on infectiousness as measured by [CONTACT_400786] . For example, at an individual level, it is currently 
unknown if vaccinated individuals should continue to wear masks or social 
distance, or if they should be quarantined if exposed to COVID -19. At a policy 
level, it is unknown if vacci nation should be required for cert ain settings, such as 
public transit including air travel, places of employment , or school . These 
questions are  especially important given that SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_505206] SARS -CoV -2 (4), suggesting that  trials  relying on 
seroconversion as a marker  of infection may miss infections .  
While there are many populations at risk for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505207] and September 2020, COVID -19 cases among young people 
aged 18-22 years increased 55% nationally (5) and during June -August 2020, 
young people aged 20-[ADDRESS_505208] incidence of disease in the US , 
accounting  for >20% of all confirmed cases (6). Further, increases in SARS -CoV -
2 infection among younger adults in the Southern US preceded  increases among 
older adults by 4 -15 days, which confirms the importance of younger adults 
spreading infection to older, more vulnerable populations (5). At the same time, 
individuals aged 18 -29 account for a tiny  percentage (0.5%) of all deaths due to 
COV ID-19 and are very unlikely to develop severe disease (7). These reasons 
plus the congregate and social living situations of students  and that many schools 
are regu larly testing their student body make them an excellent population to 
examine . The proposed study is designed to evaluate comprehensively the vaccine 
efficacy profile of the Moderna COVID -[ADDRESS_505209] on 
acquisition of infection includi ng asymptomatic infection, on disease and severity 
of disease, on measures of i nfectiousness, and transmission of infection.  
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 11 of 166 This study is a 2-arm randomized, open -label trial in adults aged 18 through 29 
years  augmented with an observational cohort  that will compare those who are 
randomized to receive the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine up on enrollment 
(Immediate Vaccination Group ) to those who are randomized to receive the 
vaccine 4 months later ( Standard of Care Group ) and those who prefer not to be 
vaccinated (Vaccine Declined Group). The study will capture all incident 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505210] daily nasal swabs, to enable ascertainment of the timing of 
acquisition and to capture the full viral load trajectory for incident infections. To 
capture secondary transmission events, very close contacts o f study  participants 
will be enrolled who may undergo  school or other community  testing  for incident 
infection over the duration of the study (‘prospective contacts’); in addition, 
diagnosis of infection among a study participant will trigger recruitment o f 
addit ional participant contacts (‘case -ascertained close contacts’). When a study 
participant tests positive based on testing of study -collected nasal swab s, school 
testing, or community testing , both prospective contacts and case -ascertained 
close conta cts wil l be asked to collect daily nasal swabs for [ADDRESS_505211] of a vac cine 
requires considering the other effects of the vaccine ( see Table 2-1) (8). The most 
fundamental  effect of a vaccine is to reduce acquisition of infection , sometimes 
referred to as ‘ vaccine efficacy against susceptibility’ , written VE S, and measured 
by [CONTACT_400787] -confirmed infection in the vaccine vs. 
placebo group . A vaccine that reduces acquisition of infection will provide benefit 
to the individual  (i.e. direct effects) , as well as benefit to the population by 
[CONTACT_400788]  (i.e. 
indirect  effects ). Modeling studies suggest t hat COVID -[ADDRESS_505212] , not only 
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 12 of 166 reducing disease, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], an d mortality, but reducing transmission of 
infection and thereby [CONTACT_400789] (9, 10) . 
An additional potential indirect effect of a vaccine is its effect on reducing 
secondary transmission of infection, written VE I and defined as the multiplicative 
reduction in the rate of secondary transmission among v accine vs. placebo 
individuals who be come SARS -CoV -2 infected. A vaccine might reduce 
transmission through reducing the magnitude and/or duration of viral shedding, 
by [CONTACT_400790], or by 
[CONTACT_400791].  Evaluating the 
effect of a COVID -[ADDRESS_505213] SARS -
CoV -2 infection  would necessarily y ield a net increase in the number of 
asymptomatic infections.  If individuals who become asymptomatically infected 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_400760], and given that 
asymptomatic individuals are less likely to be dia gnosed and self -isolate, such a 
vaccine  has the potential to increase transmission and prolong the pandemic (2, 
3). 
As we prepare this study , we recognize there are other approaches to measuring 
population level benefit (eg, vaccine effect on infection and  transmissibility ). 
These approaches include : observational studies , such as those being conducted in 
Israel to examine population benefit of the vaccine  and those planned by [CONTACT_400792] s to household contacts in 
longitudinal cohorts ; and ancillary studies with frequent swabbing on a s ubset of 
participants in Phase 3 studies. However, none of these studies will allow for the 
rigorous capture, through daily nasal swabbing, of the early dyn amics of viral 
replication and the capture of transmission events during the acute period of 
infecti on in a randomized trial .  
All of these vaccine  salutatory  effects may depend on a variety of individual 
characteristics such as age, prior infection with SARS -CoV -2; on virological 
characteristics ; and in the case of VE I which conditions  on infection , may depend 
on clinical characteristics such as symptomatology.  
As will be discussed below in detail, the ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_505214] plausibly influence exposure and 
therefore infection, but knowledge of va ccine receipt is viewed as less likely to 
influence disease, viral load, and secondary transmission.

acquisition of infec tion may still reduce onward transmission among  indivi duals 
who become infected despi[INVESTIGATOR_400761] , as measured by [CONTACT_128466] I (8, 
11). As discussed above, understanding the effect of a COVID -[ADDRESS_505220] SARS -CoV -2 infection  would necessarily yield a 
net increas e in the number of asymptomatic infections. If individuals who become 
asymptomaticall y infected despi[INVESTIGATOR_400760], 
and given that asymptomatic individuals are less likely to be diagnosed and self -

pandemic (2, 3) .  
If a COVID -[ADDRESS_505221] could be achieved. Deterministic 
compartmental models fit to data from King County, Washington and envi sioning 
vaccine rollout starting De cember 1, 2020 to 18% of the adult population 
proportionally across age groups, suggest that while a vaccine that reduces 
COVID -19 disease by 90% and SARS -CoV -2 infection by 10% reduces total 
infections in 2021 by 18.1% a nd deaths by 27.5%, if the vaccine additionally 
reduces infectiousness by 50% the impact on infections would more than double 
(to 49.3% reduction) and deaths would be cut in half (to 50.9% reduction) (Swan 
and Dimitrov  et al, in preparation ; Figure 2-1).

Figure 2-1 COVID -19 vaccine that reduces infectiousness by 50% has greater impact on 
infections and deaths.  Deterministic compartmental model calibrated to King County, WA 
stratifie d by [CONTACT_654], SARS -CoV-2 infection status, COVID -19 treatment status and vaccination. 
800,000 doses vaccine (for 18% of population) starting Dec 1, 2020, allocated proportionally across 
age groups. Absent vaccination, 20%  of infections are asymptomatic; asympt omatic infections are 
28% less infectious than symptomatic infections, but more transmissible due to lower rates of 
diagnosis and quarantine. Both vaccines reduce COVID -19 disease by 90% and SARS -CoV-2 
infection by 10 %. While one vaccine (light blue) does not reduce infectiousness among individuals 
who become infected, the other vaccine (dark blue) reduces infectiousness by 50%. As a result, it 
achieves a much greater reduction in both infections and deaths. (Swan, Dim itrov et al , in 
preparation) . 
In the co ntext of limited vaccine supply, mathematical modeling also suggests 
that optimal allocation of vaccine depends on how well a vaccine reduces 
infectiousness. Take, for instance, a d eterministic  compartmental  model cal ibrated 
to Washington State  that uses t he following assumptions: that, absent vaccination, 
40% of infections are asymptomatic , asymptomatic infections confer equal 
immunity and are equally infectious , and that there is sufficient vaccine supply for 
30% of the population. For a vaccine that redu ces COVID -19 disease by 90% but 
has no effect on infection or infectiousness, the limited supply of vaccine should 
be allocated to older adults who have a high burden of disease in order to 
minimize deaths and peak ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_602] ( Figure 2-2). However, if the vaccine 
also reduces infectiousness by 60%, minimizing peak hospi[INVESTIGATOR_400762], while minimizing deaths still requires 
vaccinating older adults. These results again highlig ht the critical importance of 
understanding vaccine effects on acquisition and infectiousness in order to make 
policy decisions.

Figure 2-2 Deterministic  compartmental  model calibrated to Washington State ( 7.6M people), 
reflecting US demographics.  Model assumes  4.56M doses vaccine (for 30% of population) 
assuming  10% of the population is previous ly infected and immune and there are 1000 current 
infections.  Absent vaccination, 40% of infections are asymptomat ic; asymptomatic infections confer 
equal immunity (for at least 6 mo. duration) and are equally infectious. (Matrajt et al , in preparation)  
Non-human primate (NHP) data also suggests that elimination of viral shedding 
by a COVID -[ADDRESS_505222] (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) , and thus improve markers of disease severity, 
three out of the four platforms tested did not eradicate nasal viral shedding in all 
cases.

Finally, not understanding relative infectivity is a huge gap in translating vaccine 
use to public health messaging. The demonstration of reduced infectivity may 
reduce vaccine hesitancy. Public health, medical personnel and organizations may 
embrace vacci nation, as well as users, if the vaccine both provides individual as

for vaccination. Data from this  trial can facilitate this messaging as well as help

trials are to evaluate vaccine efficacy ( VE) against COVID -[ADDRESS_505226] seroconversion using infrequent 
serology (every [ADDRESS_505227] 3 months), but this will not fully capture all infections including those that 
are asymptomatic . Estimates based on acute infection  cohorts (12) suggest that 
12-50% of asymptomatic infections might be missed using this sampling, leading 
to an unknown magnitude and direction of bias in the estimate of VE S. Dat a from 
Long et al. found  that 40% of individuals with asymptomatic RT-PCR confirmed 
SARS -CoV -2 infections  were IgG negative at 8 weeks after the acute phase of 
infection ( Figure 2-3) (4). Further, i t has been observed that asymptomatic cases 
have lower IgG titers across all antigens (including NP) ( Figure 2-4) (13). In

infected; viral load (VL) is only measured for those who are symptomatic and 
only after the onset of symptoms. Data from the Moderna trial where nasal swabs 
were collected at the time of vaccine administration on days [ADDRESS_505228] that the vaccine may reduce the level of nasal carriage of 
virus  (14). However, one time point does not robustly capture the full viral 
dynamics of infection, in particular , asymptomatic infe ctions. The data are  
suggestive that the vaccine may reduce viral carriage  (15). The level of viral 
shedding prior to the onset of symptoms , when most transmission occurs (16), 
will not be captured for any infected participants. Importantly, no d ata in current 
trials  are collected on onward transmission of infection and therefore VE I cannot 
be evaluated directly.

period July -December 11th , 2020,  more  than 85 colleges and Universiti es had 
more than 1 ,000 cases . Among these 49 campuses the cumulative attack rate from

given the fact that the number of reported cases for some schools includes faculty,

in comparison to the number of undergraduates.  
Among 15 Association of American Universities ( AAU ) universities , and using 
data from the start of semester through September 18, 2020,  there was an 
estimated 3.7% 1 -month attack rate. The attack rate appeared to decline  over time ; 
it was 1.7% over September [ADDRESS_505233] that a conservative assumption of SARS -CoV -2 incidence among US 
university  students for Fall semester 202 0 is 6%. A conservative incidence 
assumption for Spring and Summer [ADDRESS_505234] tracing, social distancing measures, as well as 
vaccine rollout to priority populations outside the universit ies, is therefore 3-6%.  
The outbreaks of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_505235] been reported 
to be associated with students residing in high density housing, socializing off 
campus, and not following social distancing guidelines  (19). In the US, it is 
estimated that 45 percent of young adults aged  18-22 years were enrolled in 
colleges and universities in 2019  (16). As such, much of the increase in cases this 
summer and fall are attributed to college students. The coll ege campuses are 
associated with a high rate of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505236] that SARS -CoV -2 can be 
spread by [CONTACT_400793]  (20-23). VL data among 
individuals with acute SARS -CoV -2 infection also indic ate that peak VL usually 
occurs before disease onset  (22, 24) . This suggests that there is a substantial 
transmission potential before symptom onset. According to the latest Centers for 
Disease C ontrol and Prevention ( CDC ) estimate 40% of SARS -CoV -2 infections 
are asymptomatic  (25). Available data indicate that younger individuals appear 
more likely to remain asymptomatic following infection  than older individuals  
(26, 27) . A recent study done in the [LOCATION_006] showed about 80% of children  between 
10-19 years of age remain  asymptomatic (28). As infected young students  are less 
likely to show clinical symptoms, the number of  clinical  cases reported among 
young populations would be lower, but the asymptomatic young students could 
still be capable of transmitting the virus to others  (29).

2.8 Evidence for v iral load as a marker of COVID -19 disease severity and 
clinical course  
Beyond infectiousness, there is a growing body of evidence su pporting a linkage 
between VL and COVID -19 disease outcome. Two Phase 2/3 trials of monoclonal 
antibodies for COVID -19 treatment in outpatient settings found that VL at 
enrollment and early after intervention was associated with future clinical 
outcomes and disease course (30, 31) . In the BLAZE -[ADDRESS_505240] -infusion the frequency of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_400763] a high VL (Ct value of less than 27.5) was 
12% (7 of 56 patients), as compared to 0.9% (3 of 340 patients) amon g those with 
a lower VL . Numerous observational studies have also identified associations 
between VL and clinical outcomes (32). The highest quality evidence comes from 
large cohort studies. In a large hospi[INVESTIGATOR_400764], Pujadas et al (33) estimated a 
highly significant 7% increase in mortality per log10 incre ase in VL at admission, 
after adjusting for other factors associated with clinica l outcomes (p = 0.0014, 
multivariate Cox model). Chen et al (34) confirmed this finding in a larger cohort 
of patients admitted to th ree [LOCATION_001] City hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. These data suggest that VL 
at and soon after the time of symptom onset may be a useful measure of disease 
severity.  
2.9 Methods for capturing transmiss ion  
Reducing transmission is key to ending/controlling the COVID -19 pandemic . Due 
to vaccination, the number of asymptomatic individuals might increase as 
vaccine -induced immune responses may lead to VL reduction. However, it is still 
to be discovered whether those individuals will continue to shed and transmit 

CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_505241]  transmission of SARS -CoV -2 
infection from study participants  can be  identified  in combination with  sequence -
analysis and phylogenetics methods (35).  
Estimating vaccine efficacy in reducing transmission (VE I), requires me asuring 
transmission of SARS -CoV -2 from vaccinated and unvac cinated individuals to 
others (36, 37) . Measuring transmission of infected individuals to uninfected 
individuals is challenging, especially for transient infections where it may be 
more difficult to ascertain which  infection occurred first. For example, beca use 
HIV is not transient and per -exposure transmission is low, resulting in a 
potentially long time period of exposure, transmission can be studied in sero -
discordant sexual partnerships. In a transient infection , ideally both members of 
the transmission p air are monitored before either is infected so that timing and 
direction of transmission can be easily determined. Prospectively following a 
cohort of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and their close conta cts to 
observe whether infection is transmit ted from study participants to close contacts, 
or from contacts to study participants, based on frequent testing of both allows for 
better quantification of the temporality of events regarding infection transmiss ion, 
if it occurs. To do this, Datta et al. propose augmenting a randomized, controlled 
vaccine trial with a cohort of close contacts of trial participants. Both trial 
participants and the contact [CONTACT_400797], 
allowing  for estimation of VE I. Another approach to capturing transmission 
events is a case ascertainment design (38, 39) . Under this design, contacts of 
index cases are enrolled and tested as the cases emerge over time. A  similar case 
ascertainment design was used for a recent household study for SARS -CoV -2 
prevention. In the HCQ PEP trial, which was a household -randomized, double -
blind, controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis to prevent 
acquisition  of SARS -CoV -2 among close contacts recently exposed to persons 
diagnosed with SARS -CoV -2 infection, individuals were self -referred from 
infected individuals and enrolled online and all study procedures were done 
remotely including infor med consent and dai ly self -nasal swabbing for 14 days 
(40). A case -ascertained approach is more resource -efficient than a prospective 
contact [CONTACT_400798] a large number of contacts, most 
of whom w ill not bec ome infected nor have an infected index case in the main 
study. Because contacts are only identified and tested after index case diagnosis, 
the case -ascertained approach also enables assessment of secondary transmission 
in contacts not participa ting in fre quent, prospective testing programs. However, 
the case -ascertained approach has the potential to miss or misclassify transmission 
events given the gap between diagnosing an index case and identifying, enrolling, 
and testing a contact. Index case s may also experience stigma when identifying 
contacts at the time of diagnosis, as opposed to when identifying contacts 
prospectively and before infection. The feasibility of recruiting and retaining 
contacts  of young adults , and of classifying transmission events a mong contacts,

cohort. The PCC Cohort will be identified at enrollment as close and sustained 
contacts of main study participants (eg, roommates or co -workers). Participants in 
the PCC cohort may undergo routine screening for SARS -CoV -2 infection as part 
of their attendance at their school or location of  employment, which may allow 
the participant and study team to receive real -time clinical diagnosis of COVID -
19 during the study . Additionally, w hen a positive case is identified for a main 
study participant, the participant (‘index case’) will identify and refer their recent 
close contacts for enrollment into the CACC cohort. For both cohorts, infection 
diagnosis of the associated main study parti cipant will trigger intensive short term

CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 34 of 166 5 IRB/E C review considerations  
US Food and Drug Administ ration (FDA) and other US federal regulations 
require IRBs/ECs /REs  to ensure that certain requirements are satisfied on initial 
and continuing review of research (Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),  
Part 46.111(a) 1 -7; 21 CFR 56.111(a) 1 -7). The f ollowing section highlights how 
this protocol addresses each of these research requirements. Each CoVPN  
Investigator welcomes IRB/EC /RE questions or concerns regarding these research 
requirements.  
5.1 Minimized risks to participants  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 1 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 1: Risks to subjects are 
minimized.  
This protocol minimizes risks to participants by (a) correctly and promptly 
informing participants about risks so that they can join in partnership with the  
researcher in recognizing and reporting harms; ( b) respecting local/national blood 
draw limits; (c) performing direct observation of participants postvaccination and 
reporting  information regarding side effects to the FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse 
Event Reporti ng System (VAERS ) per EUA guidance ; (d) having st aff properly 
trained in administering study procedures that may cause physical harm or 
psychological distress, such as blood draws, vaccinations, COVID -19 testing and 
counseling; and ( e) providing safety mon itoring.  
5.2 Reasonable risk/benefit balance  
45 CFR 4 6.111(a) 2 and 21 CFR 56.111(a) 2 : Risks to subjects are 
reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and 
the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to 
result.  
In all public health research, the risk -benefit rat io may be difficult to assess 
because the benefits to participant s in prevention protocols  are not as apparent as 
they would be in treatment protocols, where a study participant may be ill and 
may have exhau sted all conventional treatment options. However,  this protocol is 
designed to minimize the risks to participants while maximizing the potential 
value of the knowle dge it is designed to generate.

45 CFR 46.111 (a) 3 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 3: Subject selection is 
equitable  
This protocol has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for investigators to 
follow in admitting participants into the protocol. Participants are selected 
because of these criteria and not because of pos itions of vulnerability or privilege. 
Investigato rs are required to maintain screening and enrollment logs to document 
volunteers who screened into and out of the protocol and for what reasons.  
5.4 Appropriate informed consent  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 4 and 5 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 4 and 5: Informed 
consent is sough t from each prospective subject or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative as required by 45 CFR 46. 116 and 
21 CFR Part 50 ; informed consent is appropriately documented as 
required by [ADDRESS_505266] be obtained before any study 
procedures are initiated and assessed throughout the trial (see Section 9.1). Each 
site is provided training in informed consent by [CONTACT_400807]  a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on the informed consent process . The 
CoVPN  requires a signed consent document for documentation, in addi tion to 
chart notes or a consent checklist . 
5.5 Adequate safety monitoring  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 6 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 6 : There is adequate 
provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of 
subjects.  
Vaccination  providers are required to report to VAERS the certain  adverse events 
after COVID -19 vaccination, under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)  and 
encou raged  to report  adverse events  to Moderna TX 
|(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/vaccination -provider -support.html , see 
Section 11). Additionally , the use of v-safe will be recommended to vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (https://www.cdc.g ov/coronavirus/2019 -
ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html , see Section 11), and  an Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (IDMC)  will periodically review s tudy data.

CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_505267] privacy/confidentiality  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 7 and 21 CFR 56.111  (a) 7: There are adequate 
provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and maintain the 
confidentiality of data.  
Privacy refers to an individual’s right to be free from unaut horized or 
unreasonable intrusion into his/her private life and the right to con trol access to 
individually identifiable information about him/her. The term “privacy” concerns 
research participants or potential research participants as individuals whereas the 
term “confidentiality” is used to refer to the treatment of information abou t those 
individuals. This protocol respects the privacy of participants by [CONTACT_106807] (see 
Appendix A , Appendix B , Appendix C  and Appendix D  ). The privacy of 
participants is protected by a ssigning unique identifiers in place of the 
participant’s name [CONTACT_115646]. In the [LOCATION_002], rese arch 
participants in CoVPN protocols are protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality 
from the US NIH, which can prevent disclosure of st udy participation even when 
that information is requested by [CONTACT_106809]. Participants are told of the use and 
limits of the certificate in the study consent form.  In addition, each staff member 
at each study site in this protocol signs a n Agreement on  Confid entiality and Use 
of Data and Specimens with the CoVPN. In some cases, a comparable 
confidentiality agreement process may be acceptable.  Each study site participating 
in the protocol is required to have a standard operating procedure on how the staff 
membe rs will protect the confidentiality of study participants.

CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 37 of 166 6 Statistical considerations  
With an overall goal of accruing  48,000 person -months div ided evenly between 
vaccinated and unvaccinated follow -up time, w e anticipate enrolling up to 18 ,000 
participants . Up to  12,000 participants  will be randomized 1:1 to Immediate 
Vaccination Group  (at Months 0 and 1) or Standard of Care Group , with 
vaccination given  at Months 4 and 5  if not received off -study previo usly. Up to a n 
additional 6,000 participants will be enrolled into the Vaccine Decline d Group 
and will also  be offered vaccine at Months 4 and 5.  Operational monitoring of 
SARS -CoV -2 incidence, retention , outside COVID -19 vaccination, adherence to 
study procedures, and enrollment and tes ting of contacts in the PCC and CACC – 
pooled over main study participant groups -- will guide the choice of total number 
randomized and tota l number in the Vaccine Declined Group. Guidelines will be 
specified in the study SAP.  
Primary analyses of vaccine efficacy against infection ( VE S) and of the vaccine 
effect on viral load (ΔVL) will be conducted among all main study participants 
SARS -CoV -2 seronegative at enrollment . These analyses will be  supported by 
[CONTACT_400808] “Day 29 Negative Set”--the set of participants without PCR -
confirmed infection on or prior to Day 29 —that only  count SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505268] -Day 29 ; see Table 6-1 for a full d efinition of the 
various analysis sets for the study. Secondary analyses will  be conducted among 
all participants who receive both immunizations , ie, the Per-Protocol Set . 
Immunogenicity assessment will be done i n the Case -Cohort Immunogenicity 
Set—a subsample of the participants randomized to immediate vaccination and  
sampled on the basis of SARS -CoV -2 infection status and baseline characteristics 
that will be fully described in the study SAP.  
The FAS  differs fro m a full Intention -to-Treat set by [CONTACT_400809]. The exclusion of these individuals is justified 
because the effects of the vaccine  are unlikely to influence such exclusion. 
Because of the brief length of time between r andomization and e nrollment  
(ideally these will be on the same day ), we expect almost all randomized 
volunteers to be in the FAS.  
All primary and secondary analyses will be done according to  enrollment group , 
ie, Immediate Vaccination  Group , Standard of Ca re Group , or Vacci ne Declined  
Group .   
Main study participants will be tested using real-time PCR testing of swabs, and 
these  data will be used to identify SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505269] result s for main study participants  – based on  PCR testing of study 
swabs  or based on other testing systems  indicative of acute infection – will trigger

infection events diagnosed th rough any testing system  – either by [CONTACT_400810].  
The two contact [CONTACT_32024] – the PCC and the CACC  – will both be used for 
analyses of the vaccine effect on secondary transmission, as described below.  
The study is “t ime-driven”, ie, the primary analysis will occur when all 
participants have completed the 4 months follow -up. The number of primary 
endpoint infection events that accrue in the study is random and will depend on 
the level of SARS -CoV -2 incidence in each ar m.

For the CACC: 75% of main study participants enroll contact(s) and 
the average number of contacts enrolled is  [ADDRESS_505272] to a small 5% loss-to-follow -up rate . This person -time 
may come entirely from 12,[ADDRESS_505273] of Care Group  and followed for 4 months (16 
weeks), or, if there is insufficient unvaccinated follow -up among those 
randomized to Standard of Care, it will be supplemented w ith unvaccinated 
follow -up for p articipants in the Vaccine Declined Group. The power calculations 
apply, regardles s of where  the unvaccinated follow -up comes from . For this 
reason, w e refer to the two groups being compared as “ vaccinated” and 
“unvaccinated ”, where the former group consists of  participants  randomized to 
immediate vaccination and the latter group may in clude both participants  
randomized to Standard of Care Group and participants  enrolled in the Vaccine 
Declined Group (see Figure 2-7). 
Power calculations also focus ed conservatively on numbers of infections that 
accrue post -Day [ADDRESS_505274] -
enrollment;  and in the Day [ADDRESS_505275]-Day 29 infection  events, ie , SARS -CoV -2 infections among baseline 
seronegative participants in the D29 - set and diagnosed after Day 29 , will accrue 
to adequately power analyses addressing both primary objectives as well as key 
secondary objectives . Specifica lly, with 24,000 person -months of vaccinated 
follow -up and 24,000 person -months of unvaccinated follow -up, under a 4% 
SARS -CoV -2 incidence absent vaccination over 16 weeks (a conservative 
assumption for US college campuses, see Section 2.5, and supported by 
[CONTACT_400813] ), assuming VE S = 50% and other 
assumptions laid out in Table 6-2, a total of [ADDRESS_505276]-Day 29 infection  events will 
occur across vaccinated and unvaccinated groups  with probability 0. 5 and 214

The stu dy IDMC  will provide study oversight and ensure that the study is on -

summaries of study progress  throughout the study . Given  the short duration of the 
study and the considerable pr ior data establishing safety and efficacy of the

monitoring boundaries for VE or non -efficacy.  The IDMC  will make 
recommendations to protocol chairs and lead advisors . The s et of metrics, 
operational targets for them, and potential remedial actions will be laid out in full 
in the IDMC  Charter .  
6.3 Randomization  
A participant’s randomization assignment will be computer generated and 
provided to the CRS study staff through a Web -based randomization system.  
Randomization will be stratified . The randomization will be done in blocks to 
ensure balance among contempora neously evaluated Immediate  Vaccination and 
Standard of Care arms within levels defined by [CONTACT_400816] . 
6.[ADDRESS_505297]-outside -study -vaccination will be censored for 
primary and secondary analyses. In the rare instance that a participant receives 
study vaccination at the wrong time, the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will 
address how to analyze the data. A nalys es are modified intent -to-treat in that 
individuals who are randomized but not enrolled do not contribute data and hence 
are excluded. Because  of the brief length of time between randomization and 
enrollment , few such individuals are expected.  
The SAP will spec ify how data from the Vaccine Declined group will contribute 
to assessing primary and secondary objectives. Wherever possible, analyses w ill 
limit to data collected on randomized participants, and will entail comparing 
outcomes between those randomized to Immediate Vaccination or Standard of 
Care. However, if operational data on enrollment, retention, adherence to study 
procedures suggest t hat there wil l be insufficient unvaccinated follow -up for the 
Standard of Care Group to permit a specific analysis , data from the Standard of 
Care Group will be combined with data from the Vaccine Declined Group, with 
methods fully pre -specified in the SAP . 
Analyses fo r primary endpoints will be performed using SAS and R. All other 
descriptive and inferential statistical analyses will be performed using SAS, 
StatXact, or R statistical software.  
In general, no  formal multiple comparison adjustments will be e mployed for 
multiple secondary endpoints. However, multiplicity adjustments will be made for

in the Immediate Vaccin ation vs. Standard of Care arms . This analysis that 
restricts attention to randomized participants will be supported by a co-primary 
analysis that combines data from the Standard of Care arm with data from the 
Vaccine Decline d Group. An additional supporti ve analysis will restrict to  the 
D29- set, counting only infection events diagnosed post -Day [ADDRESS_505303] for a n SAP-
specified set of “risk” variables , or a composite risk score based on them, that are  
potentially associated with SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505304] for H0: VE = 0% with a type [ADDRESS_505305] is in estimation as opposed to hypothesis 
testing  and the study is designed  to ensure  that the lower limit for the CI will lie 
above 30% with high probability  under VE > 60%.The baseline hazard function 
in the Cox model will be strati fied by [CONTACT_400817] , which 
improves precision  of the  VE estimate and accounts for the fact that SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505306] for time -dependent exposure -related variables.   
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 48 of 166 The proportional hazards assumption will be evaluated using methods of 
Grambsch and Therneau (51).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary VE Analyses  
The primary analysis of VE again st SARS -CoV -2 infection  will be repeated in the 
FAS and D29- sets but including baseline seropositive participants  [Secondary 
Objective 5]; and in the PP set  [Seconda ry Objective 9]. The same methods  also 
apply to evaluating VE against seroconversion [Seco ndary Objective 2] and VE 
against COVID -19 disease [Secondary Objective 3]. Additional secondary VE 
analyses will be conducted where the time of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505307] outside vaccination, a secondary analysis will be performed that 
includes infection events and person -time that accrue following outside 
vaccination with the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine . Participan ts receiving outside 
vaccination other than Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine will continue to be censored 
at the time of outside vaccination. A time -varying Cox model will be used for 
inference , per methods in the study SAP.  
The asymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection e ndpoint  [Secondary Endpoint 8] is 
defined by [CONTACT_400818] 0, 2, and 4. The occurrence of a COVID -[ADDRESS_505308] on VL will focus on the primary VL 
endpoint, peak log10 viral load, and will condition on SARS -CoV -2 infection  
status. Peak log10 viral load will be estimated by [CONTACT_400819]10 
viral load measure ; secondary VL analyses will employ pa rametric models to 
estimate VL at peak. The mean observed log10 viral load will  be compared 
between the Immediate Vaccination and Standard of Care arms . This analysis that 
restricts attention to randomized participants will be supported by a co -primary 
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_505309]. These include  a model -based esti mate of peak log10 viral load, 
duration of detection of virus  [estimated e mpi[INVESTIGATOR_400765] a 
model fit to the viral load curve] , area under the log viral load curve [AUC] 
calculated using the trapezoidal rule, and area under the portion  of the log viral 
load curve over 105 viral copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL . Some mathematical m odeling studies 
provide evidence of transmission potential for VL above this threshold (21), but 
there is considerable uncertainty and therefore other thresholds will be 
considered. Analysis methods will be the same as for the prim ary VL endpoint 
above.  
In addition, the above  VL endpoints will be evaluated using  unconditional 
analys es, ie, not conditioning on SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505310] an endpoint  value defined for analysis, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a value of 
zero. The ‘transmission potential’ endpoint [Secondary endpoint 4] is one such 
endpoint that is defined unconditionally. The merit of unconditional  analyses is 
that they are not subjec t to potential post-randomization selection bias. A 
disadvantage of the unconditional analyses is that they may have lower statistical 
power.   
An additional  VL endpoint  that will be studied is a censored event -time variable, 
time to VL above 105 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. This endpoint is def ined for all enrolled main 
study participants and will be analyzed using the same methods used to evaluate 
VE against SARS -CoV -2 infection, but onl y counting infections once VL is 
above 105 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL. Additional methods of analysis that allow for the 
uncer tainty in the level of virus that is associated with transmission will be 
considered.   
Sensitivity analyses for VL will include data from all SARS -CoV -2 infected 
participants diagnosed based on PCR testing of study swabs or based on outside 
testing.

endpoints . 
6.4.5  Secondary transmission analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Identifying ‘adjudicated transmission e vents’  
An expert adjudication committee will examine and make a primary 
determination to identify ‘ adjudicate d transmission events’ from a main study 
participant diagnosed with infection (‘index case’) to a contact [CONTACT_400820] -CoV-[ADDRESS_505312] could 
also be a main study participant in theory, although this is  unlikely given the 
relatively small proportion of each community  that will be recruited to the main 
study. The adjudication committee will operate  under a charter that lays out a pre -
specified set of criteria for defining  the occurrence and direction of t ransmission 
and will be blinded to the enrollment group  of all study participants  and contacts . 
The endpoint definition will include criteria that need to be met regarding the 
temporal relationship (eg, evidence that person B’s infection occurred after per son 
A’s infection, evidence of compatible incubation period), epi[INVESTIGATOR_400766] 
(evidence of close contact [CONTACT_400821] A’s infecti ous period), and relatedness of 
their SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505313] (s) in the PCC or CACC who have positive SARS -
CoV -[ADDRESS_505314] results within a pre specified period (eg, two weeks ) of the index case 
diagnosis . This will include the type, frequency, and magnitude (eg, duration  and 
setting)  of contact [CONTACT_400822]; the timing of diagnosis of 
infection by [CONTACT_400823]  (defined as  the date of 
specimen collection) ; the VL trajectories , serology , and symptomatology  for the 
index case and the contact; and summa ries of the viral sequences for the index 
case and the contact [CONTACT_400824]  (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] ). Adjudi cation of all potential transmission events will occur within a 
short time frame at the end of the study to ensure decisions are being made using 
the same background research on transmission  and to ensure that the adjudication 
can take into account all SAR S-CoV -[ADDRESS_505315] on 
secondary transmission will rely on the determination of this committee and use 
the adjudicated transmission events and ou tcomes in statistical models . These 
same primary analyses will also only include main stud y participants diagnosed 
with infection through PCR testing of study swabs . However, sensitivity analyses 
will incorporate  data from  the full set of main study participants diagnosed with 
infection either through outside  testing or through PCR testing of swabs collected 
through the study  per methods described in the SAP . 
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 51 of 166 [IP_ADDRESS]  Analyses of the vaccine effect on secondary transmission  
Primary analyses of vaccine efficacy  against seco ndary transmission will include 
adjudicated  transmission events collected from  both the PCC and CAC C. Both 
conditional and unconditional analyses will be performed. Conditional analyses 
will compare the expected number  of adjudicated  transmission events be tween 
index cases in the Immediate  Vaccination  Group vs. Standard  of Care Group . This 
analysis that restricts attention to randomized participants will be supported by a 
co-primary analysis that combines data from the Standard of Care Group  with 
data from the Vaccine Decline d Group. An additional supportive analysis will 
restric t to SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505316] transmission; or if factors associated with onward 
transmission are modifiers of VE against infection.  
A secondary analysis of this endpoint will measu re vaccine  efficacy against  
secondary transmission as the percent reduction in the expected number of 
adjudicated transmission events linked to  a participant in the Immediate 
Vaccination  Group  relative to the Standard of Care Group . In contrast to the 
prim ary transmission analysis  that con ditions on the main study participant being 
infected , all main study participants will contribute to the analysis including those 
who do not become infected  to reflect the fact t hat SARS -CoV -2-uninfected 
participants  do no t transmit to others and therefore have 0 transmission  events . 
Let N = number of adjudicated transmission events for a given index case which 
is assumed to follow  a zero -inflated Poisson distribution with the mean of the 
non-zero point mass component  is 𝜇𝑒(𝑉𝛾) , where V indicates randomization 
assignment ( 1 Immediate Vaccination ; [ADDRESS_505317] of Care). Further let 𝛽 denote  
the log hazard ratio from a Cox proportional hazards model for infection time . 
Then the ratio of  the expected number of adjudic ated transmission events linked 
to a participant in the Immediate Vaccination  Group  relative to the Standard of 
Care Group  can be expressed as  
𝑒𝜃=𝑒𝛾𝑒𝛽, 
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 52 of 166 where 𝜃 is a measure of the vaccine’s impact on total onward transmission 
(transmission  from participants in main study) and 𝑒𝜃 is the relative reduction in 
the proportion of adjudicated transmission events  in the Immediate Vaccination  
Group  relative to the Standard of Care Group . This is analogous to the product 
estimator in the proporti onal means model (53, 54) . Note that this formulation 
assumes the time between detection in the index case participant and infection of 
a contact [CONTACT_400825].  Covariate -adjusted approaches will be  detailed in the SAP.  
The analysis tha t restricts attention to randomized participants will be supported 
by [CONTACT_400826] d Group.  
The unconditional  analysis retains high power even if there  are few breakthrough 
infections in the Immediate Vaccination Group due to high VE against infection . 
It also  properly  reflects that a vaccine is successful at reducing secondary 
transmission if it either meaningfully reduce s acquisition or reduces onward 
transmission from infected participants . Moreover, by [CONTACT_400827] -CoV -[ADDRESS_505318] -randomization selection bias issue .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Processing and phylogenetic analysis of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_505319] viral load (see Section 
10.3.2 ). Details ab out the sequencing platform and methodology for QC processes 
will be included in the study SAP. This will include the creation of a global 
alignment, which will b e used for the isolation of genes and the sequence analyses 
of local regions.  
A first step in the analysis of the sequence data will be to determine, for each pair 
of sequences among infected participants or contacts within a given study 
community , which a re identical. Data from Gen Bank, Global Initiative on Sharing 
Avian Influenza Data ( GISAID ), and other public databases suggest that we can 
expect limited variability in genetic sequences, especially those from a single 
common ancestor and constrained within a single study community over a [ADDRESS_505320] distance -based analyses of the sequences, 
including phylogenetic analysis, to identify potential lineages of infecting viral 
strains, infection clusters, and potentially linked transmissions. Phylogenetic 
analyses will also include ‘background’ SARS -CoV -2 sequences with 
geographical or temporal relevance from publicly available databases, such as 
GenBank and GISAID. The background sequences will help root the tree and give 
the tree structure and may lend insight into the identification of clusters and into 
potential transmission  events  during the adjudication process .

6.4.6  Immunogenicity analys es 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vaccine immunogenicity  
Immunogenicity will be characterized for th e immediate vaccination group only , 
using data from the Case -Cohort Immunogenicity Set (ccIS). Data from 
quantitative immunogenicity assays will be summarized using positive response 
rates and geometric means with 95% CIs, for each time point for which an 
assessment is performed. Data from qualitative (ie, yielding a positive or negative 
result) assays will be summarized by [CONTACT_400828]. 
Analyses focus on the Month 2 time point , the Day 1 time point, and the change 
in marker response between the two time points. The analyses will evaluate 
immunogenicity in all immediate vaccination arm participants and separately in  
subgroups defined by [CONTACT_400829] -CoV -2 seros tatus. The SAP will describe 
the complete set of immunogenicity analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immune response marker correlates of risk  
A separate Trial Marker SAP will describe the statistical methods and data 
analysis implementations for assessing immun e response markers a s correlates of 
the SARS -CoV -2 infection and peak log viral load  study endpoints, as well as 
various types of correlates/surrogates of protection.  
An unblinded statistical analysis by [CONTACT_106882] a primary 
immunogenicity en dpoint may be perfor med when all participants have 
completed the Month [ADDRESS_505321] 80% 
of these participants. Similarly, an unblinded statistical analysis by [CONTACT_400830] a secondary or exploratory i mmunogenicity endpoi nt may be 
performed when all participants have completed the corresponding 
immunogenicity visit and data are available for analysis from at least 80% of 
these participants. The CoVPN  Laboratory Center  will review  the analysis report 
prior to distribution t o the protocol chairs, NIAID , study product  developer, and 
other key CoVPN  members and investigators. Reports for distribution or 
presentation should use PubIDs and not PTIDs for individual responses.  
Distributio n of reports will be limited to those with a  need to know for the 
purpose of informing future trial -related decisions. The CoVPN  leadership must 
approve any other requests for CoVPN  immunogenicity analyses prior to the end 
of the scheduled follow -up visits .

The CoVPN  stores specimens from all study part icipants indefinitely, unless a 
participant requests  that specimens be destroyed or if requir ed by [CONTACT_1744]/EC, or RE.  
Other use of specimens is defined as studies not covered by [CONTACT_400843] s for the study ( see Appendix A , Appendix B , Appendix C , 
and Appendix D ). 
This research may relate to SARS -CoV -2, vaccines, coronaviruses , the immune 
system, and other dise ases. This could include genetic testing and, potentially, 
genome -wide studies. This research is done only to the extent authorized in each 
study site’s informed consent form, or as otherwise authorized under applicable 
law. Other research  on specimens (“other use”) will occur only after review and 
approval by [CONTACT_400834] , the IRB/EC of the researcher requesting the specimens, 
and the IRBs/ECs/REs of the CRSs if required.  
As part of consenting for the study, participants document their initial decision to 
allow or not allow their specimens to be used in other research, and  they may 
change their decision at any time. The participant’s initial decision about other 
use of their specimens, and any later change to that decision, is recorded by [CONTACT_106928] a Web -based tool that documents their current decisions for other use of 
their specimens. The CoVPN will only allow other research to be done on 
specimens from participants who allow such use.

11.1 FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)  
The Vaccine Ad verse Event Reporting System (VAERS ) is co-managed by [CONTACT_941] 
U.S. CDC and FDA and serves as the reporting mechanism for adverse events 
occurring from licensed and EUA vaccines, including the Moderna  COVID -19 
vaccine being used in this trial. VAERS accepts and  analyzes reports of adverse 
events (AEs) after a person has received a vaccination. It is accessed at 
https://va ers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html . 
Risks associated with receipt of the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine and AE 
reporting  requirements are described in the “Fact Sheet For Healthcare Providers 
Administering Vaccine ( Vaccination  Providers) Emergency Use Authorization 
(EUA) Of The Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine To Prevent Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID -19)”, available at https://www.modernatx.com/co vid19vaccine -
eua/. 
All v accination  providers , including those at the CRS, are required to report to 
VAERS the following adverse ev ents after COVID -19 vaccination, under 
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), and other adverse events if later revised by 
[CONTACT_29510]  |(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/vaccination -provider -support.html  
and https://vaers.hhs.gov/faq.html ): 
• Vaccine administration  errors, whether or not associated with an adverse 
event (AE)  
• Serious AEs regardless of causality. Serious AEs per FDA are def ined as:  
▪ Death;  
▪ A life -threatening AE;  
▪ Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
▪ A persistent or sign ificant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions;  
▪ A congenital anomaly/birth defec t; 
▪ An important medical event that based on appropriate medical judgement 
may jeopardize the individual and may require medical or  surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

clinically s ignificant AEs following vaccination, even if they are not sure if 
vaccination caused the event; and are to  report any additio nal select AEs and/or 
any revised safety reporting requirements per FDA’s conditions of authorized use 
of vaccine(s) throughout th e duration of any COVID -19 Vaccine being authorized 
under an EUA.    
CRS vaccination providers  will complete and submit reports to VAERS online at

Thank you for your interest in our research study. It is called CoVPN 3006. This 
informed consent form will tell you more about the study. Please read it carefully 
as you decide if you want to join. If you have  questions, please ask us. At the end, 
we will  ask you to answer  a few questions to make sure you understand the study .  
If you decide to join this study, we will ask you to sign this form. We will offer 
you a copy of this form to keep.  
CoVPN 3006  is a re search study. Research is not the same as medi cal care. The 
purpose of a research study is to answer scientific questions. We hope that what 
we learn will help people in the future.  
Key information  
• Joining this research study is voluntary. It is your choic e. 
• Our scientific questions are: Does the vacc ine protect people from getting 
infected with a coronavirus called SARS -CoV -2? Does the vaccine prevent 
people from transmitting SARS -CoV -2 to others?  
• If you join, your participation in this study will last for  about 5 months.  
• If you join, we will ask you to answer questionnaires, get injections, give 
blood, and take daily swabs of your nose .  
Here are the risks of taking part:  
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 94 of 166 • The most common risk is symptoms such as muscle aches or headaches after 
getting the injection . 
• There is a  risk of loss of your personal information .   
• There are other, less serious risks. We will tell you more about them later in 
this consent form.  
About the study  
The COVID -19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) is doing a study to test a vaccine 
against SARS -CoV -2. SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505397] of Care, 
and Vaccine Dec lined groups , will be in the Main Study.   
• The Immediate Vaccin ation  and Standard of Care groups will have a bout 
12,000 people that will get vaccine injections either immediately or 4 
months later . In this study, “standard of care” refers to all federal, st ate, 
and loca l recommendations regarding COVID -19 prevention, including 
COVID -19 vaccination, masking, social distancing, isolation and 
quarantine.  
• The Vaccine Declined group will have  about 6,000 people who prefer not 
to be vaccinated and will be followed  for 4 months .  
• The last two groups  are close contacts of the Main Study : the Prospective 
Close Contact  (PCC) group will have up to 36,[ADDRESS_505398] (CACC) group  will have up to [ADDRESS_505399] groups w ill help researchers determine if the vaccine 
prevents transmission of the SARS -CoV -2 virus to others. We will explain 
more about this later in this form.  
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_505400] indicated that you are agreeable to getting vaccinated for COVID -19 as 
recommended by [CONTACT_43614] f or Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC)  and have 
no preference as to the timing of vaccination.  
The researcher in charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert name [CONTACT_107002]] . The 
US National Institutes of Health is payin g for thi s study.  
1. This study’s vaccine  has an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)  for 
individuals [ADDRESS_505401] up -to-date “Fact 
Sheet for Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_400781]” with more information about the Moderna 
COVID -[ADDRESS_505402] sheet.  
We already know that the vaccine can prevent serious COVID -19 disease, but we  
do not know if the vaccine will work to prevent SARS -CoV -2 infection  in others.  
That is what we are testing in this study.  

CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 96 of 166 The Moderna COVI D-19 Vacc ine is not approved for sale in the [LOCATION_002] by 
[CONTACT_3133] (FDA).  
Although the vaccine is not approved, it has an Emergency Use Authorization 
(EUA) from the FDA based on its success at preventing disease symptoms fro m 
SARS -CoV-2 in other studies to date. During a public health emergency, like the 
COVID -19 pandemic, the FDA can issue an EUA to get vaccines to people faster. 
When the FDA issues an EUA, they continue to monitor safety.  
The vaccine was developed by [CONTACT_400857], Inc. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_400782] a weakened or killed virus, but the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine  is not 
made from the SARS -CoV -2 virus. The vaccine includes a short segment of 
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The mRNA is a genetic code that tells cells 
how t o make a protein. This mRNA is made in a laboratory. When injected into 
the body, the mRNA vaccine causes some cells to make that viral protein, which 
can trigger the immune system. Your immune system protects you from disease. 
If a p erson is later infecte d, their immune system remembers the protein from the 
vaccine which may help it to fight the virus. It is impossible for the vaccine to 
give you SARS -CoV -2 or COVID -19 infection.  
Risks of the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine:  
To date, more t han [ADDRESS_505403] people who got the vaccine had some 
reaction after their injections, especially after the second injection. The reaction to 
the vaccine didn’t affect their daily lives and it wen t away after two or three days. 
Most of these people said they had pain in the arm where they got the injection. 
These people also felt tired, had headaches, muscle and joint pain, and chills. A 
much smaller number of these people sai d they had redness or swelling where the 
needle went in their arm.  Some people had swelling of the lymph nodes in the 
same arm  of the injection . 
The risks of the study vaccine seen so far are the same as what have been seen 
with most vaccines. Generally, v accines can cause fever, chills, rash, aches and 
pains, nausea, headache, dizziness, and feeling tired. Vaccines can also cause 
pain, redness, swelling, or itching where you got the injection. Most people can 
still do their planned activities after getting  a vaccine. Rarely , people have side 
effects that limit their normal activities or make them go to the doctor.  
Rarely, a vaccine can cause you to have an allergic reaction. You might have a 
rash, hives, swelling of your face and throat, a fast heartbeat, d izziness and 
weakn ess, or trouble breathing. Allergic reactions can be life -threatening. Tell us 
if you have e ver had a bad reaction to any injection or vaccine.  
There may be other risks that we don’t yet know about, even serious ones. We 
will tell you if we learn about any  new risks.

11. If you get COVID -19, we will ask you to do several things.  
If you find out that you have COVID -19, please let us kn ow right away. We wi ll 
ask you to quarantine per local guidelines. By [CONTACT_130077], you also 
agree to share any SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505417] group (CACC). We may also ask you to 
provide us with their contact [CONTACT_400862] r each out to them 
directly . You may remember at the beginning of this form that we told you that 
about 2,250  people will be enrolled in the CACC group. The CACC group will 
help us learn if people who got the study vaccine are less likely to give SARS -
CoV -2 to someone else.  When considering who to ask to be your CACC, you 
should think about whether you feel comfortable or saf e sharing your infection 
status with them  if you get SARS -CoV -2. If you don’t feel comfortable sharing 
this information with them, you s hould not ask them to participate as a CACC.  
It is possible that someone you know m ay also be participating in the Main part of 
the study and might identify you as a close contact. They will not know you are 
also participating in the study unless you choos e to tell them. If someone else 
identifies you as a close contact, they will give you their referral code. It is okay 
to be enrolled in both the Main part of the study and the CACC group.  
If you find out that you have COVID -19, you will be directed to con tact the 
clinic, and we will ask you to either come to the clinic to have your blood drawn 
or we will ask you to self-collect  less than one teaspoon of blood and complete 
one additional eDiary questionnaire. It is important that  you give the blood 
sample a s soon as possible after finding out the you have COVID -19.

complete an End of Study questionnaire.  
Other Risks  
13. There are other risks to being in this study.  
This section describes the other risks and restrictions we know about. There may 
also be unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn an ything 
new that may affect your willingness to stay in the study.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood 
and giving injections. These procedures can caus e bruising, pain, faint ing, 
soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore, bleeding, and (rarely) muscle damage 
or infection where you got the injection.  
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 106 of 166 Risks of swabbing your nose:  
The feeling of having a small, soft -tipped swab inserted into your nostril  and 
twirled around may be a little uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. There is 
a small chance there could be some bleeding, but this is unlikely.  
Risks to your personal i nformation:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal informatio n. Although the risk 
is very low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened, you could have stress or 
anxiety.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
It is unlikely, but the genetic tests done on y our samples could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or 
other problems.  
Risk of anxiety/emotional stress:  
You may feel anxiety or emotional stre ss if you experience any of the risks 
described  here. You may feel worried if tests show that you have SARS -CoV -2. 
Some of the questions we will ask you may make you feel uncomfortable.  
Risk of delaying COVID -19 vaccine:  
COVID -19 vaccines are highly effec tive at preventing COVID -19 illness . The 
Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that you receive a 
COVID -19 vaccine  if it is made available to you . By [CONTACT_400863] -CoV -2

CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 108 of 166 We believe these steps are important to protecting your health, but it is up to you 
whether to complete them.  
Injuries  
Sites: Approval from CoVPN Regulatory Affairs (at [EMAIL_7682]) is 
needed for any change (other than those that the instr uctions specifica lly request or those 
previously approved by [CONTACT_400864]) to the boxed text. You can remove the box 
around the text.  
17. If you get sick or injured during the study, contact [CONTACT_106986].  
Paragraph below for all sites.   
Your heal th is important t o us. (Sites: adjust the following 2 sentences if 
applicable to the care available at your site)  We will tell you about the care that 
we can give here. For the care that we cannot provide, we will explain how we 
will help you get care else where.  
2 paragra phs below for all sites.   
This research study is covered by a US government program that may provide 
compensation for a serious injury or death. We will give you a handout with more 
information about this program.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) do es not 
have a mechanism to provide direct compensation for research related injury.  
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by 
[CONTACT_55825]. Or you might lose wages beca use you cannot go to work. 
However, there a re no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if they are 
study related.  
You always have the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied.  
18. When samples are no longer needed for this study, the C oVPN wants to use 
them in other studies and  share them with other researchers.  
The CoVPN calls these samples “extra samples”. The CoVPN will only allow 
your extra samples to be used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark 
your decision at the  end of this form.  
Do I have to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, the CoVPN will destroy all extra 
samples that it has. Your decision will not affect your being in this study.  
Where  are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. Your samples will be stored in the CoVPN repository in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 109 of 166 How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples  will be stored. [Site: Revise the previous  sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Researchers may make scientific 
discoveries or products using your samples. If this happens, there is no plan to 
share any money with you.  
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other stud ies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. 
They may help other people in the future.  
Will the CoVPN sell my samples and informatio n? No, but the CoVPN may share 
your samples with other researchers. Once the CoVPN shares your samples and 
inform ation, it may not be able to get them back.  
What information is shared with researchers? The samples and information will 
be labeled with a cod e number which will not be removed. The key to the code 
will stay at this clinic. However, some information that the CoVPN shares may be 
personal, such as your race, ethnicity, sex, and health information from the study.  
What kind of studies might be done  with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to vaccines, the immune system, coronavirus, and other 
diseases.  Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
If you agree, researchers may compare all of your genes (your geno me) to the 
genomes of many other people. Researchers look for common patterns of genes to 
help them understand di seases. The researchers may put the information into a 
protected database so that other researchers can access it. Your name [CONTACT_400883].  
Usually, no one could connect your genome to you as a person. There are rules  
against this. It’s also really difficult to do. But there is a risk that someone could 
combine information from your genome and other public i nformation about you 
and identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other 
problems. Th e risk of this happening is very small.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your info rmation are:  
• Researchers who use your extra samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies that f und or monitor the research using your extra 
samples and information  
• The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021

About the study  
The COVID -19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) is doing a study to test a vaccine 
against SARS -CoV -2. SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505423] of Care, 
and Vaccine Declined groups, will be in the Main Study.  
• The Immediate Vaccin ation and Standard of Care groups will have about 
12,000 people that will get vaccine injections either immediately or 4 
months later. In this study, “standard o f care” refers to all federal, state , 
and local recommendations regarding COVID -19 prevention, inc luding 
COVID -19 vaccination, masking, social distancing, isolation and 
quarantine.  
• The Vaccine Declined group will have about 6,000 people who prefer not 
to be vaccinated and will be followed for 4 months.  
• The last two groups are close contacts of the Mai n Study: the Prospective 
Close Contact  (PCC) group will have up to 36,[ADDRESS_505424] (CACC) group will have up to [ADDRESS_505425] groups will help researchers determine if the vaccine 
prevents transmissi on of the SARS -CoV -2 virus to others. We will explain 
more about this later in this form.

We will ask you to give a referral code to people with whom you expect to be in 
frequent close physical proximity during the study, like a roommate or co -worker. 
We want to ask these people to enroll in another part of this study that will help us 
find o ut if the vaccine prevents transmission of the SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505433] blood samples.  
When considering who to ask to be your PCC, you should think about whether 
you feel co mfortable or safe sharing your infection status wit h them if you get

you should not ask them to participate as a PCC.  
It is possible that someone you know may also be participat ing in the Main part of 
the study and might identif y you as a close contact. They will not know you are 
also participating in the study unless you choose to tell them. If someone else 
identifies you as a close contact, they will give you their referral cod e. It is okay 
to be enrolled in both the Main part of the study and the PCC group.  
We may also ask you for the name [CONTACT_400886]’t reach you or if you are unable to talk. We may contact [CONTACT_400869] (for example, to tell you about the study result s). 
We will ask you to c ontinue to follow any school  or employer program for SARS -
CoV -[ADDRESS_505434] your samples to see how your body, including your 
immune system, responds to a potential infection.  
We will send you r samples to labs approved by [CONTACT_400834]. Your samples will 
not be labeled with your name [CONTACT_29097].  
Researchers may also do genetic testing related to this study on your samples. 
Your genes are passed to you from your birth parents.  Differences in people’s 
genes can help explain why some people get a disease while others do not. The 
genetic testing will on ly involve some of your genes, not all of your genes (your 
genome). The researchers will study only the genes related to the immun e system 
and coronavirus, and genes that may affect how people get coronavirus.  
If you get SARS -CoV -2, the researchers may loo k at all of the virus’ genes that 
are in your samples. The researchers will use this information to learn more about 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505435]. For all other lab tests, we will not provide the 
results to you or the site.  
When your samples are no longer needed  for this study, the CoVPN will continue 
to store them.

Other Risks  
12. There are other risks to being in this study.  
This section describes the other risks and restrictions we know about. There may 
also be unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn anythin g 
new that may affect your willingness to stay in the study.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood 
and giving injections. These procedures can cause bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore, b leeding, and (rarely) muscle damage 
or infection where you got the injection.  
Risks of swab bing your nose:  
The feeling of having a small, soft -tipped swab inserted into your nostril and 
twirled around may be a  little uncomfortable, but it should not be pai nful. There is 
a small chance there could be some bleeding, but this is unlikely.  
Risks to your personal information:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk 
is very  low, it is possible that your personal informa tion could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened, you could have stress or 
anxiety.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
It is unlikely, but the genetic tests done on your samples could show you m ay be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others f ound out, it could lead to discrimination or 
other problems.  
Risk of anxiety/emotional stress:  
You may feel anxiety or emotional stress if you experience any of the risks 
described here. You may feel worried if tests show that you have SARS -CoV -2. 
Some of  the questions we will ask you may make you feel uncomfortable.  
Risk of declining  COVID -19 vaccine:  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend s that you 
receive a COVID -19 vaccine if it is  made available to you. COVID -19 vaccines

Injuries  
Sites: Approval from CoVPN Regulatory Affairs (at [EMAIL_7682]) 
is needed for any chan ge (other than those that the instructions specifically request or 
those previously approved by [CONTACT_400864]) to the boxed text. You can 
remove the box around the text.  
16. If you get sick or injured during the study, contact [CONTACT_106986].  
Paragr aph below for all sites.   
Your health is important to us. (Sites: adju st the following 2 sentences if 
applicable to the care available at your site)  We will tell you about the care that 
we can give here. For the care that we cannot provide, we will explain how we 
will help you get care elsewhere.  
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) does not have a mechanism to provide 
direct compensation for rese arch related injury.  
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by 
[CONTACT_55825]. Or you might lose wages because you cannot go to work. 
However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if they ar e 
study related.  
You always have the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied.  
17. When samples are no longer needed for this study, the CoVPN wants to use 
them in ot her studies and share them with other researchers.  
The CoVPN calls these samp les “extra samples”. The CoVPN will only allow 
your extra samples to be used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark 
your decision at the end of this form.  
Do I hav e to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, the CoVPN will destroy all extra 
samples that it has. Your decision will not affect your being in this study.  
Where are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. Y our samples will be stored in the CoVPN repository in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20, 2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 125 of 166 How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be stored. [Site: Revi se the previous sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority  imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Researchers may make scientific 
discoveries or products using your samples. If this happens, there is no plan to 
share any m oney with you.  
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. 
They may help other people in the future.  
Will the CoVPN sell my samples  and information? No, but the CoVPN may share 
your samples with other researchers. Once the CoVPN shares your samples and 
information, it may not be able to get them back.  
What information is shared with researchers? The samples and information will 
be lab eled with a code number which will not be removed. The key to the code  
will stay at this clinic. However, some information that the CoVPN shares may be 
personal, such as your race, ethnicity, sex, and health information from the study.  
What kind of studie s might be done  with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to vaccines, the immune system, coronavirus, and other 
diseases.  Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
If you agree, researchers may compare all of your g enes (your geno me) to the 
genomes of many other people. Researchers look for common patterns of genes to 
help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information into a 
protected database so that other researchers can access it. Your name [CONTACT_400887].  
Usually, no one could connect your genome to you as a person. There are rules 
against this. It’s also really difficult to do. But there is a risk that someone could 
combine information from your genome and  other public i nformation about you 
and identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other 
problems. The risk of this happening is very small.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who ma y see your info rmation are:  
• Researchers who use your extra samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your extra 
samples and information  
• The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Commi ttee

Thank you for your interest in getting the Moderna COVID -[ADDRESS_505444] questions, please ask us.  
After reviewing this informed consent addendum, if you decide to get the 
Moderna COVID -19 vaccine in this study, we will ask you to sign this form. We 
will o ffer you a copy of this fo rm to keep.  
1. This study’s vaccine has an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for 
individuals [ADDRESS_505445] up -to-date “Fact Sheet 
for Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] C aregivers” with more information about the Moderna 
COVID -[ADDRESS_505446] sheet.  
We already know that the vaccine can prevent serious COVID -19 disease, but we 
do not know if the vaccine will work to prevent SARS -CoV -2 infection in others. 
That is what we are testing in this study.  
The Moderna COVID -19 Vaccin e is not approved for sale in the [LOCATION_002] by 
[CONTACT_3133] (FDA).  
CoVPN 3006  Version  4.0 / May 20,  2021  
CoVPN 3006_v4.0_Final.docx  / Page 129 of 166 Although t he vaccine is not approved, it has an Emergency Use Authorization 
(EUA) from the FDA based on its success at preventing disease symptoms from 
SARS -CoV -2 in other studies to date. During a public health emergency, like the 
COVID -19 pandemic, the FDA can iss ue an EUA to get vaccines to people faster. 
When the FDA issues an EUA, they continue to monitor safety.  
The vaccine was developed by [CONTACT_14358], Inc. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_400784] a weakened or killed virus, but the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine  is not 
made from the SARS -CoV -2 virus. The vaccine includes a short segment of 
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The mRNA is a genetic code that tells cells 
how to make a protein. This mRNA is made in a laboratory. When injected into 
the body, the mRNA vac cine causes some cells to make that viral protein, which 
can trigger the immune system. Your immune system protects you from disease. 
If a person is la ter infected, their immune system remembers the protein from the 
vaccine which may help it to fight the v irus. It is impossible for the vaccine to 
give you SARS -CoV -2 or COVID -19 infection.  
Risks of the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine:  
To date, more than [ADDRESS_505447] people who got t he vaccine had some 
reaction after their injections, especially after the second injection. The reaction to 
the vaccine didn’t affect their daily lives  and it went away after two or three days. 
Most of these people said they had pain in the arm where they got the injection. 
These people also felt tired, had headaches, muscle and joint pain, and chills. A 
much smaller number of these people said they had redness or swelling where the 
needle went in their arm. Some people had swelling of the lymph nodes in th e 
same arm of the injection.  
The risks of the study vaccine seen so far are the same as what have been seen 
with most vaccines. Generally, vaccines can  cause fever, chills, rash, aches and 
pains, nausea, headache, dizziness, and feeling tired. Vaccines can  also cause 
pain, redness, swelling, or itching where you got the injection. Most people can 
still do their planned activities after getting a vaccine.  Rarely, people have side 
effects that limit their normal activities or make them go to the doctor.  
Rarel y, a vaccine can cause you to have an allergic reaction. You might have a 
rash, hives, swelling of your face and throat, a fast heartbeat, dizziness an d 
weakness, or trouble breathing. Allergic reactions can be life -threatening. Tell us 
if you have e ver ha d a bad reaction to any injection or vaccine.  
There may be other risks that we don’t yet know about, even serious ones. We 
will tell you if we learn ab out any new risks.

About the study  
The COVID -19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) is doing a study to test a vaccine 
against SARS -CoV -2. SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505456] of Care, 
and Vaccine Declined groups, will be in the Main Study.  
• The Immediate Vaccin ation  and Standard of Care groups will have about 
12,000 people that will get vaccine injections either immediately or 4 
months later. In this study, “standard of care” refers to all federal, state , 
and local recommendations regarding COVID -19 prevention, inclu ding 
COVID -19 vaccination, masking, social distancing, isolation and 
quarantine.  
• The Vaccine Declined group will have about 6,000 people who prefer not 
to be vaccinated and will be followed for 4 months.  
• The last two groups are close contacts of the Main Study: the Prospective 
Close Contact  (PCC) group will have up to 36,[ADDRESS_505457]  (CACC) group will have up to [ADDRESS_505458] groups will help researchers determine if the vaccine

About the study  
The COVID -19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) are doing a study to test a vaccine 
against SARS -CoV -2. SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505471] of Care, 
and Vaccine Declined groups, will be in the Main Study.  
• The Immediate Vaccin ation  and Standard of Care groups will have abo ut 
12,000 people that will get vaccine injections eithe r immediately or 4 
months later. In this study, “standard of care” refers to all federal, state , 
and local recommendations regarding COVID -19 prevention, including 
COVID -19 vaccination, masking, social  distancing, isolation and 
quarantine.  
• The Vaccine Decl ined group will have about 6,000 people who prefer not 
to be vaccinated and will be followed for 4 months.  
• The last two groups are close contacts of the Main Study: the Prospective 
Close Contact  (PCC)  group will have up to 36,[ADDRESS_505472] (CACC) group will have up to [ADDRESS_505473] groups will help researchers determine if the vaccine 
prevents transmission of the SARS -CoV -2 virus to others. We wil l explain 
more about this later in this form.

Risks of blood draws:  
In this study, we will either take your blood or ask you to self -collect your blood 
with a small device. Taking blood can cause bruising, pain, fainting, soreness, 
redness, and itching.  
Risks of swabbing your nose:  
The feeling of having a small, soft -tipped swab inserted into your nostril and 
twirled around may be a little uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. There is 
a small chance there could be some bleeding, but this is unlikely.  
Risks to your  personal in formation:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk 
is very low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened, you could have stress o r 
anxiety.  
Risks of COVID -19:  
While you are in this study, you should still follow federal, state , and local 
guidelines for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_505479] to join this research study if you don’t want to.

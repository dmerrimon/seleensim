 Objective /Aims :  With the goal of reducing disparities in pediatric asthma 
morbidity and urgent care reliance, we will test the efficacy of a mHealth HC intervention 
(“Text2Breathe” – T2B) designed to equip urban, low -income parents with tools for more 
effectively communic ating with their children’s PCPs and managing their child’s asthma. Aim 1:  
To improve urban, low -income children’s asthma -related health outcomes (primary outcome: 
reduced ED visits for asthma care, secondary outcome: lower morbidity) over 12 months. Aim 
2: To improve adherence to asthma care guidelines (primary care utilization for asthma care 
and improved parent asthma care self -management) over 12 months. Aim 3: To improve parent 
cognitions (parental self -efficacy and outcome expectations) regarding part nering with their 
child’s PCP for asthma care over 12 months.  
Rationale:  Chronic diseases, such as asthma, disproportionately affect urban, low -
income children. A key recommendation of the National Asthma Education and Prevention 
Program (NAEPP) Guidelines  for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma is partnership 
between healthcare providers and patients (and their parents, for children). Facilitating 
parents’ open communication with providers regarding healthcare status and concerns can 
equip them to more effectively partner with their child’s primary care provider (PCP). Thus, 
improving the health communication skills of low -income parents could improve parent’s 
adherence to treatment recommendations including utilization of the primary care for asthma 
care, and ultimately improve their child’s asthma health outcomes . Delivering content via 
mobile technology, part of a growing field called “mobile health” or “mHealth”, may be 
particularly useful among lower -income, urban families for whom the use of  mobile  and text 
messaging is widespread as an available and efficient means of communication.10 
 
Study Design:  A parallel -groups randomized control trial with low -income parents of 
children with physician -diagnosed asthma, ages 2 -12 years inclusive, who are seen  in the 
Seattle Children’s ED  or Mary Bridge Children’s  [for asthma care]. Each hypothesis will be tested 
by [CONTACT_753222] T2B with parents receiving only standard ED -based care for 
their child’s asthma, over 12 months.   
 
Patient Selection:  276 parents of Medicaid -insured children ages 2 -12 years 
inclusive, seeking asthma care at Seattle Children’s or Mary Bridge Children’s emergency 
department  who are the primary owners of a mobile phone with text messaging service . 
 
Outcomes:  Outcome data on parental self -efficacy and outcome expectations, 
adherence to asthma care treatment recommendations (e.g. primary care utilization), and child 
Page 3 of 25 
TEXT2BREATHE PROTOCOL V. 5 
 asthma outcomes (e.g., ED visits, asthma morbidity) will be collected via structured telephone 
interviews at 3, 6, 12, 18, and [ADDRESS_1031154] - enrollment.   
Study Aims & Hypotheses  
Aim 1:  To improve urban, low -income children’s asthma -related health outcomes 
(primary outcome: reduced ED visits for asthma care, secondary outcome: lower morbidity) 
over 12 months.   
Hypothesis 1a:  Children of parents who receive T2B will make fewer ED visits for 
asthma care than those receiving standard ED asthma care alone.  
Hypothesis 1b:  Parents who receive T2B will report lower morbidity (i.e., days of 
impairment) than  those receiving standard care.  
Aim 2:  To improve adherence to asthma care guidelines (primary care utilization for 
asthma care and improved parent asthma care self -management) over 12 months.  
Hypothesis 2a:  Parents who receive T2B will report increased pr imary care utilization 
(i.e., more frequent follow -up with their child’s PCP for routine asthma care) than those 
receiving standard care.  
Hypothesis 2b : Parents who receive T2B will demonstrate greater knowledge of 
asthma self -management than those receivi ng standard care.  
Hypothesis 2c:  Primary care utilization and improved self -management will mediate 
the effect of T2B on children’s asthma -related health outcomes.  
Aim 3:  To improve parent cognitions (parental self -efficacy and outcome expectations) 
regard ing partnering with their child’s PCP for asthma care over 12 months.  
Hypothesis 3a:  Parents who receive T2B will report greater self -efficacy in 
communicating with their child’s PCP about their child’s asthma care and greater outcome 
expectations for effective treatment and control of their child’s asthma symptoms than those 
receiving standard care.  
Hypothesis 3b : Parental self -efficacy and outcome expectations will mediate the 
effect of T2B on adherence to asthma care guidelines.  
 
Background and Study Rationale  
Pediatric Asthma Epi[INVESTIGATOR_753214],1 
affecting 6.5 million children under 18 years of age in 2005,11 who annually make in excess of 
Page 4 of 25 
TEXT2BREATHE PROTOCOL V. 5 
 700,000 visits to EDs.12 Its prevalence in children has increased dramatically from 3 -4% in 1980 
to over 9.6% in 2009.[ADDRESS_1031155] both in health care costs and loss of workforce. 
Disparit ies in Asthma Care and Outcomes Disadvantaged, urban chi ldren incur a 
disproportionate share of asthma prevalence and morbidity.1 Thirteen percent of impoverished 
children less than 18 years -old are diagn osed with asthma compared to 8% of those living 
above 200% of the poverty threshold.[ADDRESS_1031156]. Stephen Teach (Consultant) and colleagues launched the IMPACT DC Asthma 
Clinic in 1992 to provide comprehensive asthma education, medical consul tation and care 
coordination that is consistent with NAEEP guidelines. The clinic typi[INVESTIGATOR_753215], taking advantage of the 
“teachable moment” that naturally occurs after t he crisis of an asthma attack. In a [ADDRESS_1031157] involving 488 children with physician -diagnosed 
asthma aged 12 month s to 17 years presenting to the ED for acute care of asthma.15 The cohort 
was predominantly AA (86%) and economically disadvantaged (57% had annual household 
incomes <$30,000; 68% had public insurance). Prior to enrollment, reliance on the ED was high, 
with more than half reporting ≥4 ED visits in the previous 12 months. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_753216], 24% reported no scheduled visits to a PCP to discuss asthma in the 
prior 12 months.   
Over the six -month follow -up period, patients in the interven tion group had significantly 
fewer unscheduled visits (to urgent care or emergency departments) than patients in the 
control group [1.4 visits vs. 2.3 visits  respectively, adjusted RR=0.6 (95% CI:0.5 -0.8)]. Equally 
important, the i ntervention group reporte d more symptom -free periods and decreased asthma 
severity at one -month follow -up with improvements in several measures of quality of life that 
largely persisted over the six -month follow -up period. The intervention also increased more 
proximal behaviors su ch as adherence to long -term asthma control medications and reduced 
exposure to environmental triggers (e.g., smoking in the home).   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], the IMPACT DC intervention did not increase primary care 
utilization over the six months of follow -up [adjusted mean of 2.05 visits in the intervention 
Page 5 of 25 
TEXT2BREATHE PROTOCOL V. 5 
 group vs. 2.04 visits in the control group,  adjusted RR=1.0 (95% CI:0.85 -1.18)]. In addition, the 
proportion of caregivers reporting their PCP to be their child’s primary source of asthma care 
did not dif fer at one -month follow -up (48.7% in the intervention group vs. 49.1% of controls, 
p=NS). To better understand the implications of this  shortcoming, our research team assessed 
the impact of parent -provider relationship on asthma outcomes for the 94% (n=460 ) of 
participating children whose parents identified a PCP.[ADDRESS_1031158] DC intervention’s effectiveness in improving 
child asthma outcomes. It is this deficiency in primary care utilization, which our subsequent 
health communication i ntervention was designed to address.  
Rationale for Intervening to Improve Parent Communication: 
Enhancing Effects of IMPACT DC  
 
Relevance of Effective Patient -Provider Communication to Guideline -
based Asthma Care  
Effective communication is necessary in the development of a patient -provider care 
partnership, which the NAEPP Guidelines emphasize is essential for improving asthma control 
and reducing exacerbations (e.g., urgent care visits).[ADDRESS_1031159] found that more patient -centered and partnership -
building provider communication styles are associated with patient satisfaction with care, 
adherence to treatment plans and quality of healthcare.17-21 Unfortunately, such 
communication is le ss frequently obser ved with low -income patients.22For children with 
chronic diseases, parents (i.e., primary caregivers) play a critical role in disease management 
and are necessary mediators of the patient -provider partnership. Though less abundant than i n 
the adult literature, studies of parent -provider communication (PPC) have also found a 
relationship between communication and parent satisfaction with care, adherence to 
treatment recommendations, and discussion of psychosocial issues.23-28 As it has imp lications 
for disease self - (or in this case parent) management, poor parent -provider communication 
could play a role in the increased morbidity associated with asthma among low -income, urban 
children.29 
Page 6 of 25 
TEXT2BREATHE PROTOCOL V. 5 
 Shifting from Provider Communication Training to Par ent/Patient 
Training  
Previous interventions to improve patient -provider partnerships have primarily focused 
on improving provider communication skills and teaching providers to be more collaborative 
with patients and families.30-35 While such training of p roviders remains an important priority, 
partnership with PCPs also requires that the patient/parent effectively communicate issues 
such as emerging symptoms or response to medications. Such active parent participation in 
communication with their child’s pr ovider is more likely to be parent -initiated than physician -
prompted.36 Some recent research suggests parents’ communication with providers has 
implications for asthma outcomes; an asthma communication education intervention delivered 
to low -income parents  in their homes showed a trend -level effect on higher controller to total 
medication ratio at the 12 -month follow - up.37 Thus, strengthening the communication skills of 
low-income parents may improve adherence to asthma care recommendations (e.g., controll er 
medication use, routine visits with PCPs) thereby [CONTACT_753223]’s asthma outcomes.  
The Role of Parental Self -Efficacy in Improving Parent -Provider 
Communication (PPC)  
A review of the empowerment literature by [CONTACT_753224] e World 
Health Organization concluded that empowerment strategies are one of the most effective 
vehicles for improving health and reducing health disparities among disadvantaged 
populations.38 At the individual level, empowerment strategies focus on improv ing one’s self -
efficacy, and according to Social Cognitive Theory,39 self-efficacy is a critical mechanism for 
changing health behaviors (e.g., medication adherence, following up with PCP). In her 
observational research on parent -provider communication, [CONTACT_127796] (PI) examined whether 
parent -reported self -efficacy influence s audio -recorded PPC among urban, African American 
(AA) parents. Results indicated that parental self -efficacy in communicating with their child’s 
provider was an independent predictor of parent’s disclosure of concerns to their child’s PCP.[ADDRESS_1031160] of high self -efficacy was specific to lower income AA parents. The study 
also found self -efficacy to be positively associated with more question -asking and information -
giving regarding medical content by [CONTACT_753225]. Question -asking and information -giving by 
[CONTACT_1962]/parents are an important aspect of effective patient/parent -provider communication. 
Adult studies have found that patients who were more assertive and asked more questions 
during health care visits had better medication adherence, indic ating more engaged patients 
experience better outcomes.[ADDRESS_1031161]. Horn’s observational work, our team developed a HC intervention to 
educate and empower parents to communicate more effectively with their child’s PCP. Having 
the goa l of increasing parent’s self - efficacy in communicating with their child’s PCP and 
improving primary care utilization for asthma care, this intervention was guided by [CONTACT_753226] (SCT), which recognizes the impact of one’s environment on behav ior, but 
focuses on an individual’s ability,  through behavior change, to alter that environment to suit 
their needs.[ADDRESS_1031162] sustainable behavior 
change.39 Psychosocial factors include cognitions such as perc eived self -efficacy, which is the 
belief that one can successfully perform a required task in order to achieve a desired outcome. 
Environmental factors that contribute to behavior change (e.g., interventions) are facilitators - 
the provision of tools or re sources that make a behavior easier to perform.42 
As depi[INVESTIGATOR_753217] (Figure 1), our HC intervention as a 
whole serves as a facilitator for changing parents’ health communication and primary care 
utilizatio n behavior. Flores  et al. found that parent mentors were effective in improving asthma 
outcomes for minority children by [CONTACT_753227]’s asthma and facilitated the parents’ navigation of the health care system.43 In a 
similar manner, our HC intervention employs educators to equip parents with skills to achieve 
clear information exchange with their child’s PCP. The modifiable psychosocial/ cognitive factor 
that we sought to impact with the intervention was self -efficacy, w hich we aimed to improve by 
[CONTACT_753228]/skills for effectively communicating with their child’s 
PCP about asthma. Specifically, our Parent Empowerment Program in Asthma Care (PEPAC) 
provided face -to-face HC education in the cont ext of an IMPACT DC clinic visit, with emphasis 
on the information -exchange components of an asthma care visit with their PCP. In sum, 
through facilitating effective communication and improving self - efficacy, our HC intervention 
aimed to increase parents’  primary care utilization and thereby [CONTACT_753229]’s asthma 
outcomes.

TEXT2BREATHE PROTOCOL V. 5 
  
Parent Empowerment Program in Asthma Care (PEPAC)  
The PEPAC intervention as noted above, is a face -to-face HC intervention implemented 
in the context of the IMPACT DC clinic settin g. The intervention is presented in a format easy 
for parents to remember, a communication toolkit consisting of 3 S’s: Sharing information and 
concerns, Seeking information about diagnosis and asthma care plan, and Saying It Back for 
mutual verification.  
• Sharing: The importance of planning for the history -taking component of the PCP 
visit is emphasized, having parents think throug h what health information they can provide, 
their questions and concerns regarding their child’s asthma needs, and their overa ll goals for 
the visit.  
• Seeking: The physical exam and assessment aspect of the healthcare visit is 
described as information -seeking, primarily by [CONTACT_13917], so that they can develop a 
differential diagnosis or assessment and a plan for care  managemen t. The parent is also 
encouraged to seek information from the provider about the diagnosis and asthma care plan.  
• Saying It Back: Information  verification or saying it back is when parents clarify 
for themselves and the provider what the plan of care is f or their child. It is an opportunity to 
address any difference between parent and pr ovider goals for the care plan.  
These 3 S’s are conveyed to parents by a research assistant (RA) using a poster board as 
a visual aid.  
Parents are then given a wallet -sized card (Figure 2) with their child’s PCP name [CONTACT_13255] [CONTACT_544409] a reminder of the 3 S’s. The RA discusses the importance of 

Page [ADDRESS_1031163] DC visit. Parents then receive a 
“booster call” within two weeks of their visit to review the information learned during the 
intervention.  
 
 
 
HC Intervention Improves Children’s Asthma Health Outcomes – 
Validation of PEPAC  
Our team recently completed a RCT evaluating whether our HC intervention (PEPAC) 
improved upon IMPACT DC’s effectiveness at increasing primary care utilization for asthma 
care.7 A total of 150 participants (77 intervention group) were enrolled, and data were collected 
at baseline, 2 -months (n=138; 92% retention) and 6 -months follow -up (n=130; 87% retention). 
Sample demographics are comparable to those reported above for the IMPACT DC trial. At 
enrollment, according to NHLBI classifications, 54.1% of children had mild persistent asthma, 
and 31.8% had moderate persistent. 50.7% of parents  said their child had a written asthma 
action plan, and 83.0% identified their child’s PCP as the primary source of asthma care. The 
intervention group was more likely to be on public insurance, to have household income 
<$30,000, and to have environmental tobacco/smoke exposure in home, thus these variables 
were controlled in multivariate analyses.  
At two months post -enrollment, parents in the intervention group had significantly 
higher odds of identifying a PCP as their child’s main source of asthma care ( adjusted OR=12.6, 
95% CI: 1.1 -142.1) and reported a significantly lower rate of ED visits for asthma care between 
baseline and the 2 -month  assessment (adjusted IRR=0.3, 95% CI: 0.1 -0.8). These significant 
differences in utilization of primary care and acut e healthcare were not sustained [ADDRESS_1031164], the brief nature of the PEPAC intervention likely constrained the 
effects on behavior change. In our proposed study, we will extend exposure to intervention 
content via mobile phone based text -messaging. The rationale for u sing text -messaging, 
specifically among this target population, is outlined in the Innovation Section (B.1.b.) below. 
Second, we did not take into consideration parents’ beliefs about their child’s asthma. 
Specifically, as noted in the Social Cognitive The ory, 39 in addition to self -efficacy, the parental 
cognition of outcome expectations, one’s beliefs about the costs/benefits of a behavioral 
choice, may serve as a potentially modifiable factor impacting asthma outcomes. Along with 
issues of competing prio rities, this may play a role in worse asthma outcomes for minority 
children. Therefore, in the currently proposed intervention, outcome expectations will be 
targeted by [CONTACT_753230]’s personal goals for their child’s asthma outcomes, by [CONTACT_753231]. These two key enhancements to the 
PEPAC intervention will contribute to sustainability of expected health behavior changes.  
Innovation  
Advantages of mHealth Innovations  
mHealth, according to the National Institutes of Health Consensus Group, is defined as 
the use of mobile and wireless devices to improve health outcomes, healthcare services, and 
health research.44 The efficacy of mHealth technologies (e.g., text -messaging, mobile 
applications) is in part due to their convenience as a method of health information exchange,45 
and, similarly, they are effective for modifying health behavior because behavioral cues (e.g., 
reminders)  can be sent/received asynchronously, when and where they are most 
relevant/appropriate.[ADDRESS_1031165] demonstrated that mHealth technology can be 
used in pediatric settings to improve children’s chronic disease self -management (e.g., 
medication adherence, self - monitoring)  47,[ADDRESS_1031166] documented consistent positive 
effects of their Text4Health program on increasing influenza and human papi[INVESTIGATOR_462653] a virus 
vaccination rates among low -income minority youth.46,49,52,53 Their intervention delivers text 
message reminders (date, time, location of clinics) to parents along with educational content 
about the benefits of and dispelling any misconceptions con cerning the particular vaccination. 
Two of the noted advantages of this mHealth intervention are that text messages are short and 
thus may overcome literacy barriers in low -income populations, and by [CONTACT_753232].52 
Opportunity for mHealth Interventions to Address Health 
Disparities  
Approximately 85% of American adults currently (as of Spring 2013) use the Internet, 
56% own a smartphone, and 63% go online wir elessly with a laptop or cell phone.54-56 
Furthermore, 72% of Internet users reported looking online for health information with 31% of 
cell phone owners and 52% of smartphone owners saying they have used their phone to look 
up health or medical information.57 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_753218], differences in access/use vary by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity, age, income, 
education and urbanicity.54, 58 Recent studies indicate a majority of urban, low -income parents 
use their cell phones to access the internet ( 71% own a smartphone) and are very interested in 
receiving health information via mobile technology.59, [ADDRESS_1031167] important public health 
impacts in pediatric settings, where clear and frequent communication between parents and 
providers is important for managing children’s chron ic diseases (e.g., asthma, diabetes). Parents 
[or other caregivers] serve as the intermediary between pediatric patients and providers; they 
determine when healthcare is sought and are primarily responsible for relaying information 
about their child’s heal th to providers.61 Thus, utilizing mobile technology to empower parents 
to more effectively communicate with their child’s health care providers is a promising method 
for addressing disparities in childhood chronic diseases.  
Rationale for Using mHealth to Expand the Scope of a Face -to-Face 
HC Interventions  
Ongoing face -to-face tutorials with trained educators, as in the PEPAC study above, are 
labor intensive, costly and not easily generalizable, which limits this intervention’s application 
Page [ADDRESS_1031168], text messaging has become a widely used form of electronic 
comm unication, especially among urban minority populations. 72% of adults send and receive 
text messages, and minorities send more text messages than their White counterparts.[ADDRESS_1031169] useful, for example while they are discussing their child’s health with their PCP, making it 
a more effective behavioral cue. Third, as it is less intrusive than a phone call and less effortful 
than in -person meetings, p arents may be more receptive to information delivered via text. A 
survey of low -income parents of children under 6 years -old attending a Midwestern pediatric 
residency clinic indicated that the majority of this population is interested in receiving 
healthc are information (e.g., appointment reminders, test results, general health tips) via text 
messages from their PCPs.62 Fourth, messages are easily mass distributed; once the protocol is 
developed, it can readily be scaled up to a population level without ad ditional cost to program 
providers.  
Potential for Advances in the Field  
The proposed project is novel both in terms of the substance of the intervention and the 
means by [CONTACT_753233], and as such, has implications for research and clinical  
practice.  
Research Implications  
This project fills several gaps in current research on pediatric asthma treatment, parent -
provider communication, and mHealth methods for behavior change. First, this study directly 
addresses a pediatric health disparity. W hile studies have shown that mHealth can facilitate 
patient/parent -provider communication among children with asthma, [ADDRESS_1031170] of successfully engaging this population in research. 
Second, this study builds on previous successes (IMPACT DC and PEPAC) by [CONTACT_753234], low -income parents of 
children with asthma to improve their adherence to treatment recommendations. The 
proposed text -messaging is personalized and interactive, but does not directly involve  the PCP. 
Therefore, it circumvents provider time constraints and reduces the long -term costs of 
Page [ADDRESS_1031171] involved adolescents, who are 
themselves mobile phone users (see Kharbanda et al. for an exception  46,49,52,53), but by 
[CONTACT_753235], we hope to affect asthma outcomes in a 
wide age -range of children. Fjeldsoe and colleagues noted that most text messaging 
interventions for health behavior change only assessed outcomes at the end of the intervention 
period,  [ADDRESS_1031172] -effective technology for secondary prevention, and 
addressing a health behavior that is applicable across disease contexts. Part of effectively 
managing pediatric asthma is comprehensive and clear information transfer between patient 
(or more often their parents) and the healt hcare provider. While some mHealth interventions 
are designed to improve patient -provider communication,[ADDRESS_1031173] shown effects of text 
message interventions on primary prevention behaviors among URM populations.49 Also, a 
text-messaging intervention has been shown to improve asthmatic children’s disease 
management;[ADDRESS_1031174] prevention of 
asthma symptoms through primary care utilization. Finally, the proposed intervention advances 
clinical practice by [CONTACT_753236] a HC intervention that is not  
entirely disease specific. The study’s goal of improving parents’ communication self -efficacy and 
adherence to evidence -based guidelines in the care/management of a chronic pediatric 
condition can be applied to other chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes) for which there are health 
disparities.  
Scaling up an Innovative mHealth -Enhanced HC Intervention  
The overarching aim of the proposed project is to reduce a pediatric health disparity, 
specifically improving urban, low -income children’s asthma -related health b y empowering 
parents to more effectively communicate with providers and manage their children’s disease. 
Improving parent  communication and adherence to treatment recommendations in general 
could lead to positive child health outcomes for other chronic con ditions such as diabetes, 
obesity and mental illness, further reducing health disparities. Based on the findings of the 
proposed study, the next step in this line of research would be to extend this mHealth -
Page [ADDRESS_1031175] with low -income parents of children with physician -diagnosed 
asthma, ages 2 -12 years inclusive, who are seen in the Seattle Children’s or Mary Bridge 
Children’s ED [for asthma care] to test the efficacy of our mHealth HC interve ntion, T2B, 
primarily for reducing ED/urgent care visits for asthma care. Each hypothesis will be tested by 
[CONTACT_753222] T2B with parents receiving only standard ED -based care for their 
child’s asthma, over [ADDRESS_1031176] -enrollment. These telephone interviews will 
all be coordinated and conduction by [CONTACT_93749]’s study staff. Given the hi ghly 
seasonal nature of asthma -related morbidity, the text message component of the intervention 
will continue for 12 months (3 months of biweekly educational interactive text messages; on -
going parent -initiated access to key messages and reminder text mes sages for PCP follow -
up/medication refills/annual flu vaccines) allowing for the capture of individual variability in 
disease course. (Figure 3).

Study Population  
The study population will be parents/guardians of Medicaid - insured patients seen in 
the Seattle Children’s or Mary Bridge Children’s ED for treatment of their asthma. These are 
patients whose asthma is not yet well controlled and who experience the greate st morbidity 
due to environmental and social factors and are thus the most resource -intensive group.  
Inclusion criteria : Parents of Medicaid -insured children age [ADDRESS_1031177] 12 months will be eligib le. Older children/adolescents 
are excluded because they assume greater responsibility for asthma self -management, and 
their communication with providers becomes more independent over time. Parents must be 

Page [ADDRESS_1031178] 75% of parents in this population based on previous research on urban, low -income 
parents.59, 60 
Exclusion criteria:  Parents of children with significant medical co -morbidities (e.g., sickle 
cell disease,  insulin -dependent diabetes mellitus) will be excluded because of their increased 
interaction with healthcare providers.  
Recruitment and Randomization  
CRAs will identify potentially eligible patients through electronic admission board and 
medical record diagnostic codes after intake into the ED, and they will describe the study to 
potentially eligible parents while they are waiting to be seen by a provider. Interested families 
will be  screened for eligibility. If eligible, parents will complete the consent process. (See 
section 5.2.a for more details.) Then the CRA will administer a baseline questionnaire focusing 
on health care utilization, asthma self -management and morbidity, parent al self -efficacy and 
outcome expectations. After the questionnaire is completed, participants will be randomized to 
usual care or the intervention group (T2B). Randomization will occur automatically via the 
RedCap database system . Time allowing, participan ts randomized to the intervention will 
receive brief education on the 3 Ss and orientation to the text message component (including 
an “opt -in” code) while in the ED or if necessary by [CONTACT_1382] 48 hours. The text message 
education component will begin within 1 week after participants are randomized, allowing time 
for participants to enter the opt -in code.  
Retention and Compensation  
Parents will receive total compensation of $1 10 for participation in the study to be 
dispensed as: $[ADDRESS_1031179] will be g iven to the parent after he/she completes the baseline 
interview and $30 gift cards will be  sent  after the 3, 6, 12 follow -up interviews; Based on 
previous studies conducted by [CONTACT_753237], this amount should 
be sufficient to  compensate participants for their time and offset the cost incurred for the text 
messages (if any), but it will not be coercive, minimizing participation solely based on financial 
gain.  
To assist with subject retention, considering the transient nature of  this community and 
the fact that phone numbers are frequently disconnected and/or changed, we will obtain up to 
3 contacts’ phone numbers from each  participant at enrollment, and review and update 
contacts at each follow -up interview. Using this method in  previous studies, our research team 
has successfully maintained 90% subject retention at [ADDRESS_1031180] 
has extensive experience working with underserved populations [through public health 
departments] and pay -as-you-go service  providers, and can thus nimbly respond and adapt to 
Page [ADDRESS_1031181] they will 
still be called for the next follow -up.  Information for alternative contacts will also be collected 
at the time of consent.  These contacts will be utilized when participants’ provided phone 
numbers are inactive.   
Data Collection  
Trained CRAs will conduct structured in -person interviews after participants have 
consented and before randomization. Follow -up interviews, lasting approximately 30 minutes, 
will be conducted by a trained CRA blinded to participants’ randomiza tion. In cases when no 
blinded CRA is available an unblinded CRA may complete the survey. Unblinded status will be 
documented for each survey conducted. Electronic medical record review will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_753238]. Measures of asthma 
outcomes for this study are aligned with the recent recommendations of the Asthma Outcomes 
Groups for standardization of definitions and data collection methodologies for asthma 
research studies and clinical trials.75,[ADDRESS_1031182] of data collection .  The Asthma Self -Management Questionnaire will 
be administered at baseline  and 12 months.  (see appendix for Baseline Survey).  
Distal Outcome Measures – Child Asthma Outcomes  
ED visits for asthma care:  Parents will report whether and how many times their child 
was taken to the emergency room because of asthma during the past 12 months using 2 
questions administered in several national -scale surveys;  75 they will also indicate whether 
those visits included receipt of systemic corticosteroids.76 We will validate a large portion of this 
data with EMR review because Seattle Children’s is the primary  ED utilized by [CONTACT_753239]’s the primary ED utilized by [CONTACT_753240] . 
Asthma Morbidity:  Asthma morbidity will be assessed by [CONTACT_753241] (ICAC)73, 74, 77, [ADDRESS_1031183] DC intervention.15 Morbidity will be measured as the 
number of days (or nights) of impairment in the prior 2 weeks.

 Proximal Outcome Measures – Adherence  to Treatment 
Recommendations  
Primary Care Utilization:  To maintain continuity in outcomes with the IMPACT DC 
RCT,15 we will ask parents to identify their child’s primary asthma health care provider, as well 
as their child’s primary care provider. A comput ed variable will indicate whether the named 
PCP is the child’s primary asthma heath care provider. In addition, we will ask parents about 
frequency of PCP visits for asthma care at each telephone follow -up interview.  
Asthma Self -Management:  For asthma, sel f-management involves of a number of tasks 
to prevent and manage symptoms, such as monitoring symptoms over time, avoiding known 
triggers, and taking medications properly. The Asthma Self -Management Questionnaire,79 a 
newly developed measure recommended by  [CONTACT_753242],80 includes 16 multiple -choice questions regarding knowledge of preventive 
strategies and controller medication use. Standardized scores (0 -100) are generated, with 
higher scores indicating more knowledge of self -management. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.71. 
Wording of questions will be revised (e.g., “you” = “your child”) to be appropriate for parents of 
children with asthma.  
Parental Self -efficacy:  The Medical Competence Communication Scale (MCCS) 
measures pati ent’s perceptions of their own communication during their most recent medical 
visits.81 The patient version of the measure is used to assess information giving, seeking and 
verifying, as well as socio -emotional communication. The MCCS, patient version, con sists of 23 
items rated on a 5 -point Likert scale (1= unimportant to 5= important) with a higher score 
indicating greater perception of communication competence. Cronbach’s alpha ranges from 
0.76 -0.92 on the various subscales. Only the 16 self -competence i tems will be administered in 
this study. Wording of questions will be modified to state “my child’s medical problem” rather 
than “my medical problem.” The Parent Asthma Management Self -Efficacy Scale (PAMSES) is a 
valid and reliable instrument designed to measure parent self -efficacy in preventing and 
managing children’s asthma attacks.82 The PAMSES consists of 13 items rated on a 5 -point 
Likert scale (1=not at all sure to 5=completely sure) with a total possible score range of 13 to 
65; higher scores indic ate greater self -efficacy. Cronbach’s alpha in a sample of primarily White 
mothers was 0.87.82  
Parental Outcome Expectations:  In accordance with other research of pediatric asthma 
interventions, to assess parents’ beliefs about possible asthma quality of l ife for their child we 
will administer an 8 -item measure of parental expectations for asthma treatment.83 Parents 
respond to statements about their expectations (e.g., “I believe that my child can be symptom 
free most of the time.”) using a 5 -point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). 
Total scores are calculated by [CONTACT_753243], and higher scores reflect more 
optimistic asthma outcome expectations (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.70).  
Page [ADDRESS_1031184] of a personalized, interactive text -messaging program 
with asthma and health communication education (derived from IMPACT DC and PEPAC), as 
well as follow -up reminders for scheduling asthma care appointments with PCP  and annual flu 
vaccines . Participants  randomized to the control group will also receive reminder texts to 
schedule with their child’s PCP and to get an annual flu shot.  An algorithm of text message 
delivery will be determined for each participant (see appendix for Sample Algorith m content). 
The manual/intervention protocol and text messaging content will be refined and finalized 
during the start -up phase of the project (see Protection of Human Subject section for timeline). 
Within [ADDRESS_1031185] 3 months, after which parents can text key words to repeat  or 
receive additional messages/education at any time.  
Text messages will be individually tailored to include  child and parent initials  and, child ’s 
gender, Parents will also choose one goal important for improving management of their child’s 
asthma and fo r communicating with their child’s PCP regarding asthma care. A component of 
their text message communication education content will be based on their identified goal. 
Information for the tailored messaging will be collected as part of the baseline survey and will 
be verified and updated at the 3,  and [ADDRESS_1031186] DC asthma education message and a second on a PEPAC health 
communication me ssage. Parents in our focus groups indicated that this frequency of messages 
would not be burdensome but welcomed and useful. Parents will also receive text message 
reminders to follow up with their child’s PCP for asthma care at appropriate times based on  the 
asthma care guidelines and relative to the date of the ED visit/enrollment into the program. 
Parents will also be prompted to reply to the text confirming a scheduled appointment with 
their child’s PCP. Some messages will prompt participants to respon d (e.g., key content 
questions, follow -up reminders for PCP visits, achievement of asthma management goals). 
Once a participant replies to a text message, the system will send a subsequent text message 
with appropriate feedback. The program will also allow  participants to send a variety of 
keywords at any time to receive additional messaging. This will allow parents, for example, to 
request the 3 S’s during a visit with the PCP. Other messages may include an embedded link to 
a URL with additional relevant c ontent (e.g., videos demonstrating proper inhaler technique, 
explanation of controller vs. rescue inhalers), which we anticipate most participants will be able

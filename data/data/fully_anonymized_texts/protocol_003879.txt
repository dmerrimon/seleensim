 Background & 
Significance  
 
 
 
 
 
Objective:  HPV vaccination of children ages [ADDRESS_484750] potential to increase HPV vaccination rates. However, low 
parent awareness of services and poor engagement by [CONTACT_386867].   
 
This will be a mixed methods pi[INVESTIGATOR_386849]  a multimodal  communication strategy to 
increase pharmacy ‐located HPV vaccination for adolescents. The 
multimodal  strategy includes adapting an existing electronic 
“forecasting” system to identify vaccine eligible children who are due 
for vaccination and communication training for pharmacy staff to 
effectively recommend HPV vaccination. The study will involve the 
enrollment of parents/guardians with children between the ages of 9 -
17 and pharmacy staff at pharmacies in Western Washington state .  
 
 
Methods  Aim 1:  Conduct key informant interviews to infor m/adapt an existing 
electronic forecasting system and behavioral counseling framework 
to match  barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination in pharmacies.  
 
Aim 2:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_386850].  
Population:  Aim 1:   Key informant interviews will be conducted with up to 12 
parents/guardians of children aged 9 -17 and up to 18 Bartell Drugs 
pharmacy staff members.  
 
Aim 2:  Administer a pre/post implementation stu dy questionnaire  to 
all pharmacy staff in up to four  independent pharmacies in Western 
Washington state  and assess the adoption of the intervention based 
upon audits.  
 
Sites:  Bartell Drugs and independent pharmacies in Western Washington

6 4. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE   
 
Background  
Human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) causes 34,800 new cancer cases in men and women each year in  
the US, over 90% of which could be prevented by [CONTACT_386868]1. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_386851] [ZIP_CODE] the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the percentage of US 
adolescents  who are  with HPV vaccination in 2018 is only 51%, well below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 
80%3. Low vaccination rates are persistent in Washington State (including the Cancer Consortium’s Catchment 
Area), with  significant geographic variation in up ‐to‐date coverage (Figure 1). The President’s Cancer Panel4 
and the National  Vaccine Advisory Committee5 have recommended expanding HPV vaccination to pharmacies 
to capi[INVESTIGATOR_222400]  “medical neighborhood” to increase v accine access and coverage.  Pharmacies are 
promising HPV vaccination  settings: 89% of US residents live within 5 miles of a pharmacy6; 50 states and US 
territories allow pharmacists to  administer HPV vaccine7; and pharmacists have a long history as vaccine  
providers8, administering millions of doses  of several types of vaccines every year9. Our previous national 
surveys showed parents are willing to have  pharmacists administer HPV vaccine to their children10‐[ADDRESS_484751] -provided HPV vaccination13. Our analysis of 
demonstration projects in 5 states also showed that while pharmacy -located  HPV vaccination was highly 
acceptable, there are significant barriers to wider implementation: low awareness for  services among parents 
and poor engagement by [CONTACT_386869]14. Our findings prompt the policy question: How can HPV vaccination be effectively 
implemented in pharmacies to help achieve the Healthy People 2020 goal? To date, no implementation 
research has methodically evaluated strategies that could support HPV vaccination in pharmacies.  
 
Rationale  
Our long‐term goal is to increase HPV vaccination rates by [CONTACT_386870] ‐
located vaccination. The objective of this CCSG catchment area pi[INVESTIGATOR_386852] a multimodal 
communication strategy that can mitigate barriers pharmacies face in communicating about HPV vaccination 
with parents and patien ts. The strategy will consist of two evidence ‐based communication approaches: 1) 
Electronic  forecasting to identify vaccine ‐eligible children15; and 2) Pharmacy staff using the 5A’s (Ask, Advice, 
Assess, Assist,  and Arrange) Behavioral Counseling Framework  to recommend HPV and other vaccines. 
Electronic forecasting allows  pharmacy staff to proactively check which of their patients are eligible for 
vaccines. A study lead by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bacci found  that proactive prompting improved pharmacy staff engagement with 
vaccination services, resulting in a 15%  increase in adult vaccinations at Bartell Drugs, a regional pharmacy 
chain in Western Washington.[ADDRESS_484752] been further improved linking  the electronic forecasting with communication training on how to 
effectively communicate about vaccines with patients.  The 5A’s Framework is a behavioral counseling 
approach endorsed by [CONTACT_386871]16 and has been effectively  used in smoking 
cessation and physical activity interventions for two decades. The  framework provides an easy rubric for 
clinicians to evaluate and engage patients’ readiness and intentions for  behavior change. Training clinical staff 
to use the 5A’s has been successful for behaviorally intensive  interventions, so  it would be reasonable to 
believe that it could be used to motivate HPV vaccination. [CONTACT_30616] recently lead a study,  published in 
Pediatrics , that identified effective HPV vaccine message charact eristics17 that could be applied to the  5A’s. 
The two communication approaches would work together by [CONTACT_386872]/their parents with vaccinations and teach pharmacy staff how to effectively communicate about 
HPV vaccination. However, these communication approaches have not been used in pharmacies to improve 
HPV vaccination.

7 5. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
Aim 1:  Adapt an existing electronic forecasting system and behavioral counseling framework to match  
barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination in pharmacies. Guided by [CONTACT_386873] 
(TDF)20, we will conduct in ‐depth interviews with pharmacy staff ( n=18) and parents  or guardians  of children 
aged 9‐17 (n=12) to identify  factors that i mpede or promote parent and patient engagement with pharmacy ‐
located vaccination services.  
 
Aim 2:  Test the impact of an adapted multimodal communication strategy in pharmacies to support 
HPV vaccination. We will deliver a communication strategy training to pharmacy staff at predetermined 
pharmacy sites within Western Washington.  We will assess pharmacy staff’s experiences with the multimodal 
communication strategy and deliverin g HPV vaccination at baseline and post ‐implementation, measuring 
outcomes selected from Proctor’s Implementation  Outcomes Framework (IOF) .21 We will also develop an 
environmental scan25 to characterize a pharmacy’s environment, vaccination workflow, and team dynamics.  
The  findings will be used to adapt the pharmacy’s workflow to better use the currently available forecasting 
syste m and  tailor a vaccine communication training for pharmacy  staff based on the 5A’s.  
 
 
6. STUDY DESIGN AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
 
6.1 Study design  
This is a mixed methods  pi[INVESTIGATOR_386853], particularly HPV vaccination. These services are readily 
available in all pharmacies in Washington state , and, as such, this protocol is largely focused on quality 
improvement of vaccination service s. 
 
Aim 1.  This aim will use qualitative approaches to identify facilitators and barriers of behavioral determinants 
related to the adolescent vaccine communication and delivery in community pharmacies, with an emphasis on 
HPV vaccination. The activities o f this aim will include  1) Conducting cognitive testing with a convenience 
sample of non -participants to get feedback on our interview questions to ensure that they are understandable 
as intended.  No personal information or data will be collected during t his phase ; 2) C onducting key informant 
interviews with Parents/Guardians and Pharmacy staff using semi -structured interview techniques and 
environmental scans. Interviews will be guided using the TDF.  The TDF provides a sound theoretical 
foundation for our inquiry into barriers/facilitators of HPV vaccination in pharmacies, as it provides a 
comprehensive framework of behavioral determinants that impact how well individuals like a pharmacist can 
adopt a nd integrate an evidence -based practice like HPV vaccination. The TDF constructs we initially include 
in the guide will be informed by [CONTACT_386874][26-28] and our other 
implementation research in pharmacies.[29, 30]  
 
Aim 1  outcomes.  Qualitative information will be used to evaluate how well the proposed communication 
strategy matches barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination in pharmacies for both parents/guardians and 
pharmacy staff.  The activities of th is aim will result in findings that will be used to adapt the existing forecasting 
system in pharmacies to identify vaccine -eligible children and develop a vaccine communication training for 
pharmac y staff.  
 
Aim 2.  This aim will use quantitative approaches to evaluate the feasibility and impact of the communication 
strategies developed in Aim 1 on adolescent vaccination rates in pharmacies, emphasizing HPV vaccination. 
We will use a pre/posttest quas i-experimental design to evaluate the change in vaccination rates at selected 
pharmacy sites after implementation of the multimodal communication strategy , as well as changes in 
perceptions and behavioral predictors of pharmacy staff.   We will also develop  an environmental scan[25] to 
characterize a pharmacy’s environment, vaccination workflow, and team dynamics. Conducting environmental 
scans of pharmacies will further contextualize barriers/facilitators to HPV vaccination .[31]

Exclusion  Pharmacy staff: Floaters/per diem . Those who object to having their interview audio 
recorded.  
Parents/Guardians:  Those who object to having their interview audio recorded.   
 
6.3.2 Representation of women, children and minorities  
All parents/guardians , pharmac y technicians  and pharmacists  will be eligible to participate in this study 
regardless of sex/gender and race/ethnicity. Since the research will be conducted in community pharmacies in 
Washington state, majority (>60%) participants are expected to be White/Caucasian , which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_386854].  We expect roughly equal numbers of male and female participants across all 
populations.  Pharmacy staff recruited into the study will likely be 60% female based on current demographics 
of this professional workforce in  Washington state.  
 
6.3.3 Co -enrollment guidelines  
There are no restrictions on co -enrollment for aims 1 & 2.  
 
6.4 Sample size considerations and sampling strategy  
Aim 1:  Purposive  sampling will be used to identify potential parent/guardian  study participants . Purposive  
sampling from participating pharmacies will be used to identify pharmacy staff.  Since the research components 
CCSG catchment Area health pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] – PROMOTE Pi[INVESTIGATOR_386847] 3, 10/27/2022  
9 of this aim are entirely qualitative in nature, no power  calculation is required. Based on previous research 
studies with pa rents/guardians and  pharmacy staff, we believe that the proposed sample sizes for Aim 1 will 
allow us to capture a diverse range of viewpoints and to achieve thematic saturation, where no new information 
is gained by [CONTACT_386875] . Sample sizes were determined based on qualitative literature that indicate 
that thematic saturation can be achieved with as few as 12 participants.  
 
Aim 2:  Purposive sampling of independent pharmacies in Western Washington state . As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_386855], appropriateness, and potential impact of a multimodal communication 
strategy, a  power calculation is not necessary for Aim 2 . Additionally, th is study is purposively designed to be 
of limited scope based on the Fred Hutch/UW Cancer Consortium expectations for CCSG pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080] . Our 
planned future study to conduct a large scale implementation trial will have resources available to hire a 
biostat istician who can support the study team in trial design and conducting power calculations /appropriate 
statistical analyses.

11 We will use convenience sampling to identify participants for cognitive testing the survey questions. The 
convenience sample will include family and friends who are pharmacy staff known by [CONTACT_5051]. 
These individuals will not be participating in research.  They will be pr oviding feedback on survey questions to 
improve survey items and to ensure survey items are understood as the research team intended.  
 
6.5.2.B Pharmacy Staff  
Recruitment & screening:  Mylinh Nguyen , Director of Practice Development  for the Washington State 
Pharmacy Association (WSPA) , will introduce study information to independent pharmacy owners in Western 
Washington state . Pharmacy owners who are interested in participating in the study must manage/operate an 
independently -owned community pharmacy . Pharmacy owners  will contact  [CONTACT_3476] . Pharmacy owners 
will provide documented confirmation of their pharmacy site’s agreement of participation in the communicatio n 
intervention . We will select [ADDRESS_484757]; thus,  no written consent will be provided.  
Enrollment:  Once pharmac ies have been enrolled into the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],  pharmacy staff will be asked to complete a pre -
implementation  online survey  (i.e., pretest ; 10-15 minutes to complete ) via a survey link to assess the 
acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of providing HPV vaccination to children aged [ADDRESS_484758] -implementation survey  (i.e., 
post test) in the same fashion as the pre -implementation survey.  
 
Description of communication strategy intervention:  The communication intervention will be planned to be no 
more than 120 minutes (target time 90 minutes).  The strategy will consist of two evidence -based 
communication approaches: 1) Electronic forecasting  to identify vaccine -eligible children; and 2) Pharm acy 
staff using the 5A’s (Ask, Advice, Assess, Assist, and Arrange) Behavioral Counseling Framework  to 
recommend HPV and other vaccines. Electronic forecasting allows pharmacy staff to proactively check which 
of their patients are eligible for vaccines. Th e 5A’s Framework is a behavioral counseling approach endorsed 
by [CONTACT_386885]’ readiness and intentions for behavior change.  The two communication appr oaches would 
work together by [CONTACT_386886]/their parents with vaccinations

7.6 FHCC infrastructure that will secure data files.   
The database management is built with multiple layers of security and the center practices appropriate due 
diligence to ensure the data is maintained in an appropriate manner. The file and database servers at FHC C 
are housed in a dedicated computer machine room containing emergency backup power, a UPS, a back -up 
power generator, a non -liquid fire suppression system, and authorization -based limited access. In  addition to 
personal workstations, administrative access to databases and corresponding data will be limited to Virtual 
Private Network (VPN) and/or Terminal Server access. Furthermore, all databases will reside behind a 
redundant firewall system and intr usion prevention system.  
 
A copy of the data will be stored in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) VPC. This account is covered by a 
Business Associates Agreement (BAA) signed by [CONTACT_386889]. The data will be 
transferred to this secure loc ation via an IPsec VPN tunnel between the Fred Hutch Data Center and the AWS 
VPC. While stored in the VPC, all data will be encrypted at rest using custom encryption keys managed with 
AWS Key Management Service. All transport between authorized AWS service s including AWS EC2 and AWS 
S3 will be over secure TLS connections. Any processing of the data will be performed using dedicated EC2 
instances to ensure compliance. All access to the AWS Environment is controlled via Security Groups and 
Network Access Cont rol Lists and audited to ensure no unauthorized access occurs.  
 
The electronic data files for this study will be processed on this dedicated, layered -security system. Access to 
data identifying individual subjects will be restricted to investigators and s taff directly involved in the study, all of 
whom have completed standard data confidentiality training. Data will be accessed by [CONTACT_386890].  Per institutional standards, all desktops connecting to Fred 
Hutch networks must be baselined by [CONTACT_386891], password protections, and 
configuration for the network to recognize an approved device.  Unauthorized users do not have access to 
areas of the network which contain sensitive data, including PHI. All paper records and forms will be stored in 
locked drawers when not in use. Access to computer records will be strictly controlled and will require 
simultaneous knowledge of the database structure, database language, and multiple passwords . Since the 
system is behind a firewall and is accessible only to study staff, the risk of unlawful penetration is not a 
significant data safeguard concern.

for Investigators and Research Staff and will have to apply for access according to the Center’s Information 
Security Policy by [CONTACT_17258] a CIT Data Services Data Request Form. The granting of access is contingent 
upon agreement to these security  policies, which dictate responsible data usage and the loss of use privileges 
if violated.  
 
7.8 Data destruction  
 
CCSG catchment Area health pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] – PROMOTE Pi[INVESTIGATOR_386847] 3, 10/27/2022

7.9 Endpoints and variables  
Aim 1:  Qualitative information will be used to evaluate how well the proposed communication strategy matches 
barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination in pharmacies for both parents/guardians and pharmacy staff.  See 
interview question guides for the interview content .  
 
Aim 2:   Quantitative  information  will be collected  to assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of 
the proposed communication strategy to support HPV vaccination . See the Pre and Post Implementation 
Survey. P harmacy audits will be conducted from the pharmacy electronic records to assess adoption of HPV  
vaccination, measured as the average HPV vaccination rate per pharmacist at each pharmacy. We will also 
assess the impact of the communication strategy on adoption of other adolescent vaccines  (e.g., tetanus, 
diphtheria, acellular pertussis; meningoccocal conjugate; influenza) . 
 
8. Data collection procedures & data management of study records  
 
8.1 Case Report Forms (CRFs):  
Enrollment  & Demographic Survey Information  
Data collection instruments will be developed by [CONTACT_827]. Surveys and outcomes from in -depth 
interviews will be collected by [CONTACT_464]. Survey data will be collected electronically using  REDCap . 
Compared to paper data collection, electronic data collection has the potential to be more secure, in that all 
data will be password protected from the moment of data collection. Data will be uploaded directly to the 
study's secure server from REDCap . The secure server that warehouses data will be password protected and 
accessible only to study personnel directly involved in data cleaning and analysis. We will plan to use wireless 
internet to send digital data.  To protect the data, the  website to which  data will be uploaded will use  existing 
well-known SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security), as indicated by "HTTPS" in the URL. 
SSL/TLS is used by [CONTACT_386893].  All digital data will be sent and received using 
HTTPS.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_484773] Storage:  PI [INVESTIGATOR_386860], and store in a secure manner, complete, accurate, and 
current study records throughout the study.  The investigator will retain all study records for at least seven  
years after completion of the study.   Study records include administrative documentation and regulatory 
documentation as well as documentation related to each participant screened and enrolled in the study, 
including informed consent forms, contact [CONTACT_386894] m all visits during  the 
study.

17 8.3 Data analysis  
 
For both Aim 1 & Aim 2:  
 
 Aim 1: Using community ‐based sampling in collaboration with the Fred Hutch Office of  Community 
Engagement and Outreach, we will conduct audio ‐recorded, semi ‐structured interviews with parents of  
children aged 9 ‐17 (up to n=12) and Bartell Drugs pharmacy staff (up to n=18; 9 pharmacists, 9 pharmacy 
technicians)  to evaluate how well our proposed communication strategy match barriers and facilitators to HPV 
vaccination in  pharmacies. Interview guides will be informed by [CONTACT_386895]20, a widely used theoretical framework 
to understand  behavioral determinants to successfully implement health promotion programs. Interviews will be 
about 90 minutes  and qualitative data will be analy zed using framework ‐guided rapid analyses described by 
[CONTACT_386896].22 The qualitative  data will be used to adapt the pharmacy staff’s workflow to improve their use of the 
electronic forecasting system  and develop a tailored vaccine communication training ba sed on the 5A’s. 
Adaptations made to the communication  strategy will be methodically documented using Stirman’s Taxonomy 
of Adaptation Characteristics23. 
 
Aim 2: We will  evaluate the impact of the communication strategy using a pre/post implementation stud y 
design in independent pharmacies located in Western Washington state . This design is commonly used in 
exploratory/development studies. The communication strategy  will be delivered at the pharmacy study sites by 
[CONTACT_200252]. We will use the IOF21 which identifies distinct  implementation outcomes widely used to 
determine how successful implementation of an evidence ‐based practice,  like HPV vaccination, was in a 
specified setting, like pharmacies. We will use validated survey measures to assess  pharmacy staff’s report of 
the acceptability , appropriateness , and feasibility of the communication strategy to  support HPV vaccination .[ADDRESS_484774] s appropriate for small sample statistics . 
 
9.  Training procedures and quality assurance  
Study PI  [INVESTIGATOR_386861]/pharmacy staff  in study procedures , including 
recruitment, enrollment, conduct of the interviews, and maintenance of confidentiality and privacy.  Specific 
expertise in the conduct of qualitative research will be provided by [CONTACT_2296]’s qualitative expert , who  has 
conducted  qualitative research in numerous settings . All staff have been or wil l be trained in the responsible 
conduct of human subjects’  research (NIH or CITI courses).  
 
Clinical care :  No clinical care will be provided by [CONTACT_464].  
 
Adherence to protocol :  For Aim 1, bi -weekly reporting of enrollment will enable us to monitor if the  study is 
running a ccording to approved protocols.  Frequent reporting will also enable us to quickly respond to any 
problems that may arise during the study.   
 
For Aim 2, we will rely on periodi c reporting from the independent pharmacies  who will audit their pharmacy 
records and report their vaccination rates. Periodic reporting will occur at baseline (Month 0) and at least 1  
follow -up time point  after implementation of the communication strategy (Month 2 ). 
 
10. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
All members of the research staff and the personnel employed by [CONTACT_165721] -based organization will be 
trained in responsible conduct of research, i ncluding enrollment of human subjects, by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Shah and the 
research recruitment training offered by [CONTACT_386897].    
To protect against the risk of loss of confidentiality, only [CONTACT_30616] and the Project Coordinator will have ac cess 
to identifiable information or the study database. The study database will be password -protected and housed 
on a secure server at the Fred Hutch. Immediately after the semi -structured in -depth interviews data will be 
collected, the Project Coordinator  will transport the data to locked offices at the Fred Hutch. Survey data will be

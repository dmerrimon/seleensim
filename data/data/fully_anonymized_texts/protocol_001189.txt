Study Title
A Phase 2, Open-Label, multi-center Study of AL101 in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma 
(ACC) bearing activating Notch mutations
Protocol No. AL-ACC-01
Study Phase
Phase 2Clinical Sites
Approximately 16 sites in North America, and 10 sites in Europe 
and Israel
Study Rationale
AL101 is a potent and selective inhibitor of gamma secretase-mediated Notch signaling that is 
currently under development as an antitumor/antiangiogenic agent for single use or in 
combination with cytotoxic agents as well as other targeted agents in the treatment of tumor 
growth and metastasis. A large body of experimental evidence supports a causal role of 
activating Notch mutations in tumorigenesis. In adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), sequencing 
of tumor samples revealed genomic alterations in the Notch pathway in a subset of patients with 
a distinct ACC phenotype. ACC patients with NOTCH1 mutations have an aggressive disease 
with a distinct pattern of metastasis and worse prognosis than their wild type counterparts. In 
addition to NOTCH1 mutations, other NOTCH  mutations (2, 3, 4) were identified in ACC. There 
are currently no available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_37334]. Therefore, ACC with Notch pathway 
activation represents a high unmet therapeutic need.
Objectives Endpoints
Primary
To assess the clinical activity of AL101 
using radiographic assessments and 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 in ACC 
patients with activating Notch 
mutationsObjective response rate (ORR; complete 
response [CR] and partial response [PR]) 
by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 as determined by 
[CONTACT_120028]. For patients with bone-
exclusive disease, the modified MD 
Anderson (MDA) bone criteria will be used 
to access response (see Table 11).
Note: Investigator review will be done in 
accordance to FDA “Clinical Trial Imaging

Study Design
This is a Phase 2, non-comparative, open-label, multicenter study of AL101 in patients with 
recurrent or metastatic ACC who harbor NOTCH 1,2,3,4 activating mutations.
The study includes 2 cohorts, ran in a sequential fashion:
Cohort 1 – AL101 4 mg once weekly (QW) intravenously (IV)
Cohort 2 – AL101 6 mg QW IV
Cohort 1 will continue to enroll to reach up to a maximum of 45 patients. Cohort 2 will open 
for enrollment up to a maximum of 42 patients.
Prior to entering the study, to determine eligibility, potential candidates will undergo 
pre-screening assessment and confirmation for the presence of activating Notch mutations. 
Available mutation status from prior tests with any commercially available or locally 
developed NGS assay are acceptable. In Europe any commercially available CE marked 
device shall be used (for country specific requirements refer to Appendix E).
If historical genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_119989], testing will need to be conducted during pre-
screening using a laboratory developed or commercially available NGS assay to identify and 
confirm an activating Notch mutation. Any newly characterized mutation (such as tandem 
duplication, variant allele frequency, variants of unknown significance, etc.), will be evaluated 
with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis. Pre-screening study-specific assessments may be 
done while potential candidates are on other therapy provided that a separate pre-screening 
informed consent form is signed.
Patients with activating Notch mutations will then undergo screening assessments to 
determine study eligibility over a 28-day Screening period. Enrollment of patients with bone 
exclusive disease should be discussed and approved by [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor before 
enrollment (refer to inclusion criterion 5 in Section 4.1). For all patients, prior treatments and 
responses to such treatments, including radiological images and reports, within a year of study 
entry, will be collected as part of the medical history; for patients who are currently enrolled, 
this information will be collected retrospectively.
Starting on Cycle 1, Day 1, eligible patients will enroll into the study and receive AL101, 
either  4 mg intravenously (IV) weekly (QW) in Cohort 1 or 6 mg QW IV in Cohort 2, on 
Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 
consent withdrawal. For patients with radiological progression, investigational treatment may 
be continued as long as the patient is having clinical benefit, is agreed to by [CONTACT_120030]’s Medical Monitor.

ConfidentialPaired tumor biopsies will be collected at screening (fresh or archival2 within 3 years) and on-
treatment at Cycle 4 Day 1 ±28 days (provided medically safe and not contraindicated). 
Samples will be sent to a central vendor for NGS analysis. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded 
(FFPE) slides will be evaluated by [CONTACT_120031]1 stain. On the day of the on-treatment 
biopsy, blood will also be drawn for PK and biomarker assessments.
During the Treatment period, patients will undergo radiographic assessments every 8 weeks 
(±3 days) for review by [CONTACT_737]. Scans will be collected and held for possible future 
retrospective evaluation by [CONTACT_120032] (ICR). Other assessments will be 
done as specified in the Schedule of Activities (SoA; Table 1), including safety exploratory 
biomarkers. A repeat of tumor imaging will be required for the purposes of confirmation of 
response (i.e., partial response, and/or complete response). The confirmation scan should be 
no earlier than [ADDRESS_133975] indication of response.
All patients will undergo end of study (EOS) visit [ADDRESS_133976] due to toxicity, radiographic imaging will be done every 
3 months until disease progression or until the patient initiates another anti-cancer therapy.
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) review: Throughout the study, the independent DMC 
will monitor safety and efficacy parameters at approximately quarterly intervals, after at least 
[ADDRESS_133977] 2 cycles (after the first on-treatment radiographic 
assessment). Further details are specified in the DMC charter.

Evaluation of data will consist primarily of descriptive summary statistics and data listings. 
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the sample size (n), mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized in 
frequency tables. Time to event variables will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods.
If any statistical tests are performed, they will be one-sided, at the 5% significance level. 
Where confidence limits are appropriate, the confidence level will be 95%, unless otherwise 
stated.
Individual data (including relevant derived variables) will be presented by [CONTACT_120038]. Results of statistical analyses, descriptive summary statistics and supportive listings 
will also be presented.
Efficacy Analysis
Estimates of ORR and other response proportions will be presented together with 95% 
confidence intervals calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. Kaplan-Meier estimation 
will be used for the analysis of time-to-event endpoints, including DOR, PFS, and OS. 
Primary efficacy analyses will be performed on the efficacy evaluable set. Refer to the SAP 
for more details.
Safety and Tolerability Analysis
Safety will be assessed on the basis of AEs, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities,

Confidential1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 THERAPEUTIC I NDICATION
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare cancer most often occurring in the salivary glands 
with an incidence of 4.5 cases per million individuals (Lee, 2015; Moskaluk, 2013). The 
neoplasm can also arise in other locations, including the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal 
spaces, trachea, breast, lacrimal gland, skin, and lower female genital tract. ACC is characterized 
by [CONTACT_120040], with high rates of both local-regional recurrence and distant 
metastasis (Chae, 2015; Dillon, 2016; Ellington, 2012). Five, ten, and fifteen-year survival rates 
after surgical resection have been reported around 80%, 60%, and 45%, respectively, with almost 
half of patients dying from ACC, as opposed to other causes, at long-term follow-up (He, 2017; 
Lloyd, 2011).
Multiple studies have been conducted to discover genetic mutations and biomarkers specific for 
ACC (Ellington, 2012; Frierson, 2013). In addition to the frequent translocations involving 
myeloblastosis oncogene (MYB) in ACC, sequencing of tum
or samples revealed genomic 
alterations in epi[INVESTIGATOR_119991] (chromatin remodeling) pathway, DNA damage/ 
checkpoint pathway, FGF/IGF/PI3K signaling, and Notch signaling in a subset of patients (Ho, 
2013; Stephens, 2013). It was specifically demonstrated that NOTCH1 mutations significantly 
correlate with confirmed histology, advanced disease stage at diagnosis, higher incidence of liver 
and bone metastasis, and shorter relapse-free and overall survival (Ferrarotto, 2017; Sajed, 
2017).
1.[ADDRESS_134006] ACC primary tumors are treated with surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy, yet 
local and repeated recurrences are common (Ellington, 2012). In advanced stage, conventional 
chemotherapy regimens are still utilized as first-line therapy although antitumor activity across a 
variety of chemotherapy classes is poor. Cisplatin and 5-FU or CAP (cisplatin, doxorubicin, and 
cyclophosphamide) regimens can be used as combination chemotherapy (Laurie, 2011; 
Papaspyrou, 2011). Agents commonly given as monotherapy include cisplatin, mitoxantrone, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], vinorelbine, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine. However, few of these agents have shown 
efficacy, highlighting the need for new therapeutic options (Chae, 2015; Ellington, 2012; Ko, 
2016). To date
, no agent has been formally tested in ACC tumors that harbor Notch activation.
1.[ADDRESS_134007] is a single-use sterile solution (1.2 mg/mL) for intravenous (IV) administration.
Notch receptors are highly conserved, Type I transmembrane glycoproteins that regulate critical 
cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, self-renewal, survival, and cell fate 
determination. The Notch protein family has 4 members (Notch 1 to Notch 4) in mammals. 
Mammalian Notch receptors are activated by 4 transmembrane-bound ligands (Jagged1, 
Jagged2, Delta1, and Delta4 homologs) (LaFoya, 2016).

Page [ADDRESS_134008] relies on regulated proteolysis. Upon ligand binding to the Notch 
receptor, a series of steps leads to cleavage by [CONTACT_120041]. This frees the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus to 
form a transcriptional activation complex with the DNA-binding factor CSL (CBF1/Suppressor 
of Hairless/Lag1) and coactivators belonging to the mastermind-like family of proteins. Thus, a 
gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) such as AL101 can block the final step in Notch activation, the 
formation of the NICD.
1.3.1 Nonclinical Studies
The comprehensive battery of non-clinical studies conducted with AL101 included 
pharmacology studies, pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies in multiple species, and toxicity 
studies in rats and dogs.
In nonclinical models, AL101 exhibited antitumor/antiangiogenic activities including inhibition 
all 4 mammalian Notch receptors (Notch1 to Notch4) with high and equal potency. AL101 
exhibited broad-spectrum in vivo antitumor activity in nonclinical human cancer xenograft models 
of diverse histological types, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and breast, non-small 
cell lung, pancreatic, and colorectal carcinoma, among others. AL101 exerted its antitumor activity 
through direct inhibition of cell proliferation and indirectly via inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.
In vitro genetic toxicity and safety pharmacology studies and in vivo single- and repeat-dose (up 
to 5-weeks duration) IV toxicity studies in rats and dogs (including safety pharmacology 
endpoints), were performed to evaluate the potential toxicologic profile of AL101. Collectively, 
the non-clinical toxicology studies have established a dose- and concentration-dependent safety 
profile for AL101 and its active metabolite, with effects that are primarily attributed to 
target-mediated Notch inhibition.
More detailed information is available in the AL101 Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
1.3.2 Clinical Studies
The clinical development program for AL101 in cancer patients include:
Study CA216001 evaluated patients with advanced solid tumors who were treated 
with AL101 monotherapy; the study was designed as ascending multiple-dose 
study (completed on 22 June 2017, study report in progress).
Study CA216002 evaluated patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or 
lymphoma who were treated with AL101 in combinations with dexamethasone 
(completed, study report pending).
Study CA216003 evaluated patients with advanced solid tumors who were treated 
with AL101 in combination with [ADDRESS_134009]-dose chemotherapy 
regimens (paclitaxel, carboplatin-paclitaxel, and fluorouracil-leucovorin-
irinotecan [FOLFIRI]) (completed, study report pending).
Ongoing ACCURACY study (preliminary results).

ConfidentialIn Study CA216001, 94 patients were treated with AL101 (BMS-[ZIP_CODE]), of whom 83 patients 
received AL101 on a weekly (QW) schedule at doses ranging from 0.3 mg to 8.4 mg, and 11 
patients receiving AL101 every 2 weeks (Q2W schedule) at doses of 4 mg or 6 mg. The mean 
half-life (SD) following multiple-dose administration of AL101 over the 0.3-mg to 8.4-mg dose 
administered QW for at least 4 weeks ranged from 67.4 (18.7) hours to 147.8 (154.1) hours, 
indicating that AL101 is slowly eliminated. The most common reason given for discontinuation 
of treatment was disease progression, which was reported for 66 (70.2%) of patients in the study. 
Median duration of exposure was 5.9 weeks (range: 1 to 238 weeks) for the overall study 
population.
The primary endpoint was safety and establishment of recommended dose for Phase 2. Clinical 
safety data from Study CA216001 (N = 94) indicate that AL101 is tolerated at weekly doses of 
0.3 mg to 4 mg. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in the 6 mg dose level in 2 
patients (Grade 3 vomiting/Grade 3 lipase elevation and Grade 3 diarrhea) and 8.4 mg dose level 
in 3 patients (Grade 5 liver failure, recurrent Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction and Grade 3 
vomiting, each of which occurred after 2 doses of AL101). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
was defined as 4 mg for a QW dosing schedule and 6 mg for a Q2W dosing schedule (for more 
on dose selection details refer to Section 1.4.1). Most AEs have been Grade [ADDRESS_134010] 2 patients (out of 94) included hypophosphatemia (33 
patients, 35.1%)), diarrhea (18 patients , 19.1%)), hypokalemia (6 patients, 6.4%)), vomiting (4; 
patients, 4.3%)), aspartate aminotransferase increased (3 patients, 3.2%), dehydration (2 patients, 
2.1%), and hyponatremia (2 patients, 2.1%).
Best overall response assessed by [CONTACT_120042] (RECIST) v1.1 showed preliminary evidence of AL101 clinical activity in 
2 metastatic ACC patients bearing NOTCH1 mutation who were treated with AL101 4 mg IV 
infusion once per week (QW) as follows:
 First patient (63 years old male) had confirmed partial response (PR) with 
progressive disease at 8 months. Change from baseline in target lesion was 
23% decrease on Day 50 (8 weeks), 39% decrease on Day 113 (16 weeks), 
and 41% decrease on Day 162 (24 weeks).
 Second patient (66 years old female) had stable disease at the first on-
treatment assessment: 2 mm decrease (5.7%) in target lesion on Day 53/8-
week assessment. Patient received 4 mg QW and at day 44 changed to 2.4 
mg QW; she discontinued treatment due to a non-treatment-related AE (at 
day 106).
In Study CA216002, preliminary evidence of clinical activity was observed in 3 patients, 2 with 
complete remission (resulting in allogeneic transplantation in 1 patient and ongoing >17 months 
in the other patient) and 1 patient with partial remission that lasted approximately 12 weeks, all 
at the 6 mg dose level (n = 20). In addition, previous data (December 2014) showed evidence of 
clinical activity (≥ 50% reduction in bone marrow blast percentage) in 8 (32%) of 25 patients, 
including 4 patients treated at the 4 mg dose and 4 patients treated at the 6 mg dose. On a weekly 
schedule, the 6-mg dose was tolerated in this population, and the expansion cohort was opened at 
this dose level.

ConfidentialIn Study CA216003, for the more common tumor types, confirmed objective responses were 
reported for 8 of the 22 patients (36.4%) with TNBC (1 patient with a CR and 7 patients with 
PR) and 5 of the 19 patients (26.3%) with NSCLC (all with a PR). The most frequently reported 
AEs (>50% of all treated patients), regardless of causality, were fatigue, diarrhea, 
hypophosphatemia, nausea, and decreased appetite. Although there were limited numbers of 
patients in some treatment groups, the frequency of AEs appeared to be generally similar during 
QW administration of AL101 at a dose of 4 mg (Arms A, B, C) or 6 mg (Arms A, C) across all

In the current ACCURACY study, preliminary results have been reported. As of the cut-off date 
of August 31, 2019, data from [ADDRESS_134011] v1.1 or modified MDA bone response criteria was 
PR in 4 patients (22%), SD in 7 patients (39%) and PD in 7 patients (39%); disease control rate 
(PR+SD) was 61% (11 patients) (Ferrarotto, 2019). The longest response duration is over [ADDRESS_134012] 1 TEAE. 
CTCAE Grade 1 were reported by 3 patients (10.3%), Grade 2 by 6 patients (20.7%), Grade 3 by 
31% (9 patients); Grade 4 by 3 patients (10.3%) and Grade 5 by 2 patients (6.9%). The most 
frequently reported AEs (>30% of all treated patients), regardless of causality, were nausea, 
fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting. SAEs were reported for 14 patients (48.3%) with pneumonia 
reported by 3 patients (10.3), all other events were single incidences. Treatment-related SAEs 
included infusion site reactions (2 reactions in one patient) and keratoacanthoma (each, 1 patient, 
3.4%).
The observed safety profile of AL101 in the ACCURACY study to date suggests a lower rate of 
adverse events of Grade 3 and above than previously reported for AL101 Phase 1 studies 
conducted by [CONTACT_120043]. Notably, using the toxicity management guidelines for 
gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events in this protocol (outline in Section 6.6), the rate of Grade 3 
diarrhea was reduced to 3.4% vs. 19.1% in the ongoing ACCURACY study and study 
CA216001, respectively.
Based on results of study CA216001 for AL101 monotherapy, the previous developer 
recommended that the MTD for a QW dosing schedule was [ADDRESS_134013] that although the MTD in the solid tumor population treated on a QW dosing 
schedule was recommended by [CONTACT_120044]101 to be 4 mg QW, however, with a 
rigorous control of GI toxicity as shown CA216002, a dose of 6 mg is safe to administer to 
patients suffering with advanced cancer.

Confidential1.4 STUDY RATIONALE
AL101 is a potent and selective inhibitor of gamma secretase-mediated Notch signaling that is 
currently under development as an antitumor/antiangiogenic agent for single use or in 
combination with other targeted agents in the treatment of tumor growth and metastasis. A large 
body of experimental evidence supports the causal role of Notch pathway deregulation in 
tumorigenesis (Braune, 2016; Previs, 2015; Vinson, 2016; Wang, 2015; Xiao, 2016; Zhao, 
2017). In ACC, sequencing of tumor samples revealed genomic alterations in the Notch1 
pathway in a subset of patients with a distinct ACC phenotype. ACC patients with NOTCH1 
mutations have an aggressive disease with a distinct pattern of metastasis and worse prognosis 
(Ferrarotto, 2017). In addition to NOTCH1 mutations, other NOTCH  m utations (2, 3, 4) were 
identified in ACC (Bell, 2014; Sant, 2017; Stoeck, 2014).
The effe
ct of AL101 was evaluated in four ACC Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX) models that 
utilize tumors derived directly from patients have become the best platform for screening and 
predicting drug efficacy in oncology nonclinical models. These tumors, that are transferred 
directly to mice, without tissue culturing, maintain the histopathological and molecular features 
and best mimic the original human cancer (Izumchenko, 2017).
The effect of AL101 was evaluated prospectively in tumors with wild type Notch versus tumors 
with Notch activating mutations. Seventy milligrams of tumor tissue were implanted into 
Athymic Nude female mice 6-12 week old (Treatment arm N=5, Control arm N=10). 
Randomization to study arms was done once tumors reached a volume of 150-300 mm3. Dosing 
regimen was 7.5 mg/kg AL101 po weekly, 4 days on/ 3 days off. Tumor volumes were measured 
twice a week.
Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was significantly higher with AL101 monotherapy, compared to 
vehicle in both Notch mutant models (ACCx9: 110% TGI P<0.0001; and ACCx11: 78% TGI 
P=0.0441). AL101 did not have a significant effect in models without Notch activating mutations 
(ACCx6: 37% TGI P>0.99; ACCx5M1: 60% TGI P=0.25 (Figure 1).

Based on a preliminary Phase 1 study with AL101 (CA216001) where clinical activity of AL101 
was shown in an unselected patient population with solid tumors (see Section 1.3.2), the current 
study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AL101 in patients with ACC bearing 
activating Notch mutations.
The preliminary results of this study (see Section 1.3.2) suggest that the patient population 
initially recruited into this study had advanced progression, more than expected based on 
literature review (Ferrarotto, 2017; Ho, 2019). Thus, with the addition of Cohort 2, the Sponsor 
will now evaluate the biological activity in a larger patient population to better understand the 
response rate and the nature of the response as well as define the patients who are likely to 
respond to the drug in future studies.
1.4.1 Dose Selection
The doses selected for this study, 4 mg QW (Cohort 1) and 6 mg QW (Cohort 2) are based on 
nonclinical studies, prior clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_20444] (the previous developer) 
(CA216001, CA216002 and CA216003) and preliminary outcome from the ongoing 
ACCURACY study. Please also refer to the IB for further information.
In Study CA216001, in dose escalation on a QW schedule, patients were treated at AL101 dose 
levels of 0.3 (n = 4), 0.6 (n = 3), 1.2 (n = 4), 2.4 (n = 4), 4 (n = 7), 6 (n = 14), and 8.4 mg (n = 
11). In study CA216001, AL101 was safe and tolerated in doses up to 4 mg QW administration. 
DLTs were observed in the 6 mg and 8.4 mg dose levels. As AL101 potentially contributed to 
these DLTs and no DLTs were reported in the 7 DLT-evaluable patients treated at this dose in 
the dose escalation phase, the MTD in the solid tumor population treated on a QW dosing 
schedule as was recommended by [CONTACT_120045]101 to be 4 mg.
Overall, 43 patients were treated at a dose of 4 mg QW, in either the dose escalation (N=7) or 
dose expansion (N=36) phases. Treatment-related ≥Grade 3 AEs included hypophosphatemia

Confidential(41.9%; 18/43), diarrhea (18.6%; 8/43), hypokalemia (7.0%; 3/43), and anaphylactic reaction, 
anemia, AST increased, nausea, pruritus, and vomiting (2.3% each; 1/43).
PK results from Study CA216001 indicate that AL101 exposure (C max and AUC) increases 
approximately linearly for QW dosing from 4 mg to 6 mg.
PD results (Hes1 expression in PB) from Study CA216001 indicate greater maximum effect and 
duration of target inhibition when increasing the QW dose from 4 mg to 6 mg. Mean Hes1 
inhibition is maintained greater than 50% throughout 7 day period at 6 mg, where it recovers to 
under 50% by [CONTACT_4475] 7 at 4 mg.
Based on the observed safety profile of AL101 in this study to date (see Section 1.3.2), the 
existing toxicity management guidelines (outlined in Section 6.6) for GI and liver toxicity (liver 
function test to be monitored weekly; refer also to Sections 8.4.[ADDRESS_134015]) and the totality of the data from all 3 Phase 1 studies (see 
Section 1.3.2) as well as the enhanced PD modulation at 6 mg QW, the Sponsor decided to add a 
cohort with AL101 dose of 6 mg QW (Cohort 2); this dose may offer patients an increased 
benefit (as evident by [CONTACT_31577]/PD data described above) while maintaining their safety with weekly 
visits and rigorous toxicity management guidelines. Notably, using the toxicity management 
guidelines for GI adverse events, the rate of Grade 3 diarrhea was reduced to 3.4% in the 
ongoing ACCURACY study.

Confidential3 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a Phase 2, non-comparative, open-label, multicenter study of AL101 in patients with 
recurrent or metastatic ACC who harbor NOTCH 1,2,3,4 activating mutations.
The study includes 2 cohorts, ran in a sequential fashion:
Cohort 1 – AL101 4 mg once weekly (QW) intravenously (IV)
Cohort 2 – AL101 6 mg QW IV
Cohort 1 will continue to enroll to reach up to a maximum of 45 patients. Cohort 2 will open for 
enrollment up to a maximum of 42 patients. Prior to entering the study, to determine eligibility, 
potential candidates will undergo pre-screening assessment and confirmation for the presence of 
activating Notch mutations. Available mutation status from prior tests with any commercially 
available or locally developed NGS assay are acceptable. In Europe any commercially available 
CE marked device shall be used (for country specific requirements refer to Appendix E.
If historical genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_119989], testing will need to be conducted during pre-
screening using a laboratory developed or commercially available NGS assay to identify and 
confirm an activating Notch mutation. Any newly characterized mutation (such as tandem 
duplication, variant allele frequency, variants of unknown significance, etc.), will be evaluated 
with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis. Pre-screening study-specific assessments may be done 
while potential candidates are on other therapy provided that a separate pre-screening informed 
consent form is signed.
Patients with activating Notch mutations will then undergo screening assessments to determine 
study eligibility over a 28-day Screening period. Enrollment of patients with bone exclusive 
disease should be discussed and approved by [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor before enrollment 
(refer to inclusion criterion 5 in Section 4.1). For all patients, prior treatments and responses to 
such treatments, including radiological images and reports, within a year of study entry will be 
collected as part of the medical history; for patients who are currently enrolled, this information 
will be collected retrospectively.
Starting on Cycle 1, Day 1, eligible patients will receive AL101, either [ADDRESS_134016] may be continued as long as the patient is having clinical 
benefit, is agreed to by [CONTACT_120033]’s Medical 
Monitor.

of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30 questions (EORTC QLQ-C30)
The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be administered during the study at screening and then every [ADDRESS_134039] administration.
EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed as an instrument to measure cancer patients’ physical, 
psychological and social functions (Kaasa, 1995). The questionnaire is composed of 5 multiitem 
scales (physical, role, social, emotional and cognitive functioning) and 9 single items (pain, 
fatigue, financial impact, appetite loss, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, sleep disturbance 
and quality of life) (Kyriaki, 2001). It is validated and reliable and has been used successfully in 
various types of cancer, including head and neck cancer (Bjordal, 2000; Chaukar, 2005).
The example of the English version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 can be found at Appendix D and at

5.3 POPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS
Blood samples for population pharmacokinetics (PK) will be obtained at the times designated in 
the SoA, footnote q (Table 1). Start- and end-time for each investigational product infusion (and 
any interruptions) will be recorded in the eCRF. The actual time of the sample collection will be 
recorded in the eCRF. All samples will be analyzed for both parent and metabolite using liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay.
A population (mixed-effects) approach will be used to analyze the concentration data, the goal 
being to obtain a set of population parameters and to identify covariates that affect systemic 
exposure to each of the parent and metabolite. For each of parent and metabolite, one- and two-
compartment linear models will be applied to the data. If graphics suggest that these models are 
not appropriate, other models such as those including non-linearity with respect to dose and/or 
time will be evaluated. The relationship of pharmacokinetic parameters to body size will be 
evaluated systematically. Other covariates will be considered for inclusion in the model based on 
graphics. Models will be selected based on graphics and changes in the objective function. The 
analysis will be conducted with NONMEM software.

used by [CONTACT_120054]-related (certain, probable/likely, possible) 
non-hematological Grade 3  (except isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormality that are not 
associated with clinical signs or symptoms and are reversed with appropriate medical 
intervention within 48 hours) and hematological Grade 4 toxicities will lead to a 1 dose level 
reduction for AL101. For easily manageable Grade 1 or 2 toxicity, no dose reductions are 
required, but careful observation and treatment is required. Dose modification of intolerable 
Grade 2 toxicity will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with the Sponsor. Re-escalation of the 
dose following a dose reduction is allowed only after discussion and approval of the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor. Maximum AL101 treatment interruption allowed is 28 days; treatment 
interruption longer than 28 days will result in discontinuation of patient from the study. 
Additional treatment guidelines may be implemented by [CONTACT_32366], with agreement of the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor, as needed to ensure patient safety.

Confidential6.6.1 Treatment of Infusion Reactions
In case of hypersensitivity reactions, the Investigator should institute treatment measures 
deemed medically appropriate in accordance with current medical practice and treatment 
guidelines. The following treatment recommendations are based on prior experience with 
Taxol (containing Cremophor)10; these and/or other measures deemed medically necessary 
should be implemented based on the judgment of the Investigator. To reduce the risk of 
infusion reactions caused by [CONTACT_120036], premedication with H1- and H2-blockers 
(diphenhydramine and ranitidine or equivalents) or dexamethasone (Refer to Section 7.1.2 for 
additional instructions on premedication with steroids) will be given.
Note that the “Grades” listed below do not correspond to NCI CTCAE v5.0 criteria (which are 
based on response to intervention, and thus are not used here to recommend specific 
interventions). For the purpose of AE reporting and for determining the need for dose 
modifications, NCI CTCAE v5.0 grading for allergic reaction should be used.
Grade 1 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (e.g., transient flushing, rash, drug 
fever < 38°C):
Supervise at the bedside.
Report to Sponsor as an adverse event of special interest (AESI)
Grade 2 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (e.g., urticaria, drug fever  38°C, 
rash, flushing, dyspnea):
Interrupt the infusion and disconnect infusion tubing from patient,
Administer IV antihistamines (diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg), and ranitidine,
After recovery from symptoms, resume the infusion at a half of the infusion rate and if 
no further symptoms appear, complete the administration of the dose. A target infusion 
time of up to 3 hours may be appropriate in many cases.
Report to Sponsor as an AESI
Grade 3 or 4 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (e.g., symptomatic bronchospasm 
requiring parenteral medication(s) with or without urticaria; allergy-related 
edema/angioedema; anaphylaxis; hypotension):
Stop the infusion and disconnect infusion tubing from patient,
Administer epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamines, and nebulized bronchodilators as medically 
indicated,
Consider IV steroids which may prevent recurrent or ongoing reactions,

clinical judgment of the Investigator / treating physician(s) or an institutional diarrhea 
management protocol which adheres to most current medical standards.
1. Treat with loperamide
Loperamide should be started at the earliest sign of (1) a poorly formed or loose stool, (2) the 
occurrence of 1 to 2 more bowel movements than usual in 1 day, or (3) an increase in stool 
volume or liquidity. Loperamide may be taken in the following manners: [ADDRESS_134084] dose of loperamide, but is typi[INVESTIGATOR_119997] (Real, 2009). These doses should not be used for more than [ADDRESS_134085] doses of LOMOTIL® 
(diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) may be added or used instead of loperamide. Additional antidiarrheal 
measures, such as octreotide, may be used at the discretion of the Investigator or treating 
physician.
2. Interrupt AL101 dosing
For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea that is not controlled (i.e., to Grade 1) with loperamide, dosing 
of AL101 should be interrupted, as continued dosing is likely to result in increased severity of 
diarrhea. In addition, evaluation of infectious causes should be considered. Based on the 
mechanism of action and preliminary clinical experience, full gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
recovery will likely take longer than the time for diarrhea to resolve. Thus, interruption for 5 
days to 7 days beyond the resolution of diarrhea should be considered. Depending on the 
severity, time to onset, and time to resolution of diarrhea, reduction of AL101 dose and/or 
frequency, omission of future doses, or dexamethasone co-administration should be considered.
3. Increase fluid intake and, if applicable, consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_119998]-inflammatory drugs
Hypotension and/or renal insufficiency can occur in the setting of volume depletion from 
severe diarrhea. At the onset of any diarrhea, patients should be instructed to increase fluid

Confidentialintake to help maintain fluid and electrolyte balance during epi[INVESTIGATOR_119999]. Parenteral 
hydration should be started if oral hydration is not sufficient. The investigator should consider 
interrupting antihypertensive therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, if medically 
appropriate.
4. Treat with dexamethasone
For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea that is not adequately controlled with loperamide and dose 
interruption, administration of dexamethasone may be considered at the discretion of the 
treating physician/investigator. In nonclinical models of other GSIs, coadministration of 
dexamethasone has been shown to decrease the severity of intestinal pathology.(Real, 2009; 
Wei, 2010). Dexamethasone may be administered per os (PO) or IV, as appropriate. As there is 
no reported human experience with the use of dexamethasone for this indication, it is not 
known whether this effect will occur in humans at achievable exposures of dexamethasone. In 
a small number of cases, administration of dexamethasone [ADDRESS_134086] contributed to the improvement of diarrhea. If, in the 
judgment of the investigator, it is in the patient’s best interest to receive additional treatment 
with AL101 (for example, the patient has a response to therapy), dexamethasone co-
administration with future doses may be used after discussion with the Sponsor/medical 
monitor. In such cases, dexamethasone 8 mg to 10 mg daily for 2 days to 3 days, beginning on 
the day of AL101`dosing followed by [CONTACT_120057], may be appropriate.
For diarrhea associated with signs of colitis (e.g., fever, peritoneal signs, or significant GI 
bleeding), administration of dexamethasone and antibiotics should be considered. Also, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], bowel rest, and radiological evaluation may be appropriate if there are 
signs of possible intestinal perforation.
7 STUDY RESTRICTIONS
7.1 PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY
7.1.1 Premedication to Prevent Hypersensitivity Reaction
Histamine is a major mediator of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid responses in man, such as those 
induced by [CONTACT_120058], an excipi[INVESTIGATOR_120000]101. The premedication regimen below is based 
on clinical experience with other compounds containing Cremophor EL.
In order to prevent a hypersensitivity reaction, all patients initiating AL101 treatment will be 
premedicated approximately 1 hour prior to the infusion of AL101 with the following regimen:
H1-blocker (for example, diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg oral or equivalent), and
H2-blocker (for example, famotidine 20 to 40 mg oral or equivalent).
For patients who remain on study for more than 4 doses of AL101 without any evidence of 
infusion-related reaction, modification of the premedication regimen may be considered at the 
discretion of the investigator, with notification of the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. At this time, 
1 of the 2 histamine blockers may be discontinued; if there is still no evidence of infusion-
related reaction with the next 2 doses of AL101, the other may be discontinued. If under this

Confidentialdiscontinuation plan, the patient has an infusion-related reaction resulting in medical treatment, 
premedication with H1- and/or H2-blockers (as appropriate) should be resumed for subsequent 
doses.
If a patient experiences a Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reaction despi[INVESTIGATOR_120001] 
H1- and H2-blockers then the patient, if re-treated, should also be premedicated with 
corticosteroids (as described in Section 7.1.2) in addition to the H1- and H2-blockers). In the 
event that a patient has a repeat Grade [ADDRESS_134087] not receive any further treatment with 
AL101, unless agreed by [CONTACT_1034]/Medical Monitor and investigator that it is in the 
patient’s best interest to continue treatment (e.g. patient has had a response to therapy) and 
appropriate safety measures can be implemented. Such measures may include dose reduction, 
increased infusion time, initial lower infusion rate with gradual increases, and/or premedication 
with multiple doses of dexamethasone. These measures have been used to allow re-treatment 
after infusion reactions with other agents, including IXEMPRA and Taxol (Peereboom, 1993).
7.1.2 Premedication with Corticosteroids
All patients will receive premedication with corticosteroids as prophylaxis utilizing the 
approximately following regimen.
8 mg dexamethasone Per Os (PO) the night before each infusion
8 mg dexamethasone PO or IV within 30 minutes prior to dosing
8 mg PO every 8 hours for an additional 4 doses starting about 4 to 8 hours after the 
infusion is finished
Repeat for the first 4 doses (first cycle).
If there are no GI toxicities following the first 4 infusions, the number of additional doses 
following the future infusions can be decreased from 4 to 2 doses of 8 mg PO every 8 hours.
Further tapering should only be considered if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], steroid side 
effects are an issue and after discussion with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.
Other steroids, such as budesonide or prednisone may be used utilizing “prednisone 
equivalent” conversions.

during study participation with prior approval of the Sponsor’s medical monitor.
Patients with castration resistant prostate cancer who have not undergone surgical 
orchiectomy can continue on medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e., gonadotropin releasing hormone 
[GnRH] analogs) to maintain castrate levels of serum testosterone. Concurrent treatment 
with ketoconazole or anti-androgens is not permitted, and patients who have discontinued 
these medications must have a washout period of at least 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug 
(whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational product.
7.1.4 Prohibited Concomitant Medication
Medications specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the ongoing 
study. If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination specifically prohibited 
during the study, discontinuation from study therapy or vaccination may be required. The 
Investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the Investigator and/or 
the patient’s primary care physician. However, the decision to continue the patient on study 
therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the Investigator, the Sponsor 
and the patient.
Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120003] (including retreatment for post-complete response relapse) of this study:
Prior treatment with gamma secretase inhibitors.
Note: the following situations are considered 1 line of therapy:
Discontinuation of one drug in a multi-drug regimen and continuation of (an) other 
drug(s).
Restarting the same regimen after a drug holiday.
Switching from IV to oral formulation of the same drug is also considered one 
regimen.

confirmation of liver-related abnormalities, and (ii) Sponsor notification of p-DILI cases via 
SAE forms. Following the gathering and assessment of relevant clinical information the 
Sponsor is responsible for: (iii) Timely evaluation and triaging of p-DILI cases, (iv) Expedited 
reporting of p-DILI cases and (v) Expanded review of p-DILI cases including a detailed 
assessment of all available clinical information, investigations and biochemical data.
Investigators are expected to monitor ongoing routine and ad hoc hepatic laboratory test results 
to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_120012] a patient meets p-DILI criteria. They are expected to promptly 
notify the Sponsor/Medial Monitor of all p-DILI cases. p-DILI cases may be identified by

occur within 3 business days using a Hepatic Laboratory Panel (ALT, AST, TB, AP). Any 
patient with an abnormal Hepatic Laboratory Panel that meets p-DILI criteria (see Figure 2) is 
a candidate for investigational product discontinuation. Any confirmed p-DILI events must be 
reported (along with a description of the clinical findings) to Sponsor as an SAE within 24 
hours of confirmation.
An extensive clinical history, examination and appropriate investigations should be obtained to 
exclude cholestatic and other apparent causes that may explain the observed abnormalities in 
liver function and/or hepatic signs and symptoms. Other apparent causes include, non-
exhaustively and by [CONTACT_120070]: infectious diseases (such as active hepatitis -A, -B 
and -C), congenital diseases (such as Gilbert’s syndrome), neoplastic diseases (such as 
hepatocellular carcinoma), autoimmune diseases (such as primary biliary cirrhosis) and the use 
of concomitant hepatotoxic medications (such as antibiotics, the oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_120013]). All investigations to exclude potential causes of liver function abnormalities 
or hepatic signs and/or symptoms should be guided by [CONTACT_120071]’s 
age, gender, clinical history, and signs and symptoms.
8.5 NOTIFICATION OF SERIOUS UNEXPECTED SUSPECTED ADVERSE EVENT
The Investigator is responsible for identifying, documenting, evaluating and reporting SAEs

9.2 SAMPLE SIZE C ONSIDERATION
The study was initiated as a Simon’s two-stage optimal design.
The study passed the futility analysis in Stage 1 of the Simon two-stage design and is currently 
continuing to enroll patients. While the data on Cohort 1 (4 mg QW) is maturing, the study will 
enroll up to a maximum of 45 patients in Cohort 1 and in parallel will be expanded with the 
addition of Cohort 2 (6 mg QW). The study will continue enrolling a total of 42 patients in 
Cohort 2, unless an unexpected safety signal emerges that in the judgement of the DMC 
requires analysis and/or poses a serious threat to the well-being of the patient. A second look is 
may be undertaken at 50% of the total information fraction (21 patients) for Cohort 2.
The updated design, a 2-look Group Sequential design with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_120016]-spending function takes the first look after 21 patients and has the following

(even a partial dose).
Efficacy evaluable set: All patients who receive at least one dose of investigational product, 
have measurable disease at baseline per RECIST v1.1 or modified MDA criteria for bone-
exclusive disease (see Table 11), and have at least one post-baseline on-study assessment 
of tumor response.
Per-protocol (PP) analysis set: All efficacy evaluable patients who have no major protocol 
violations, as defined by [CONTACT_120037].
PK analysis set includes all patients who receive investigational product and have at least 
one post baseline evaluable PK sample.

set and the Efficacy Evaluable set. A summary of reasons for discontinuation from treatment 
and withdrawal from the study will be provided. The number of patients included in each 
analysis set will be summarized and the reasons for excluding patients from each set will be 
listed.
9.5 DEMOGRAPHIC AND BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS
Demographic characteristics including age, gender, race, and ethnicity will be presented in the 
form of tabular summary statistics for all ITT patients. Other patient baseline characteristics 
including weight, height, body mass index (BMI), initial stage of disease, and performance 
status will be presented similarly.
9.6 EFFICACY
9.6.1 Definition of Efficacy Endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint is the objective response rate (ORR). ORR is defined as the 
proportion of patients who have a best overall response (BOR) of CR or PR as determined 
using RECIST v1.1 or modified MDA criteria for bone-exclusive disease (see Table 11). BOR 
is defined as the best response recorded between the date of first dose of investigational 
product and the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy. A BOR of CR or PR requires 
confirmation of the assessment at least 4 weeks later.
Other efficacy endpoints are as follows:

first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause
OS, defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of death from any 
cause. Patients who are lost to follow-up and those not known to have died by [CONTACT_18681]-off 
date for analysis will be censored on the date the patient was last known alive, or the data 
cut-off date, whichever is earlier.

Table 11). The estimate of the ORR will be accompanied by a 2-sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence interval (CI) derived using the Clopper-Pearson method.
DOR, PFS, and OS will be summarized descriptively. The censoring rules will be defined in 
the SAP.
Refer to the SAP for more details.
9.7 SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY A NALYSIS
The safety assessment will be based on the frequency of AEs, the incidence of clinically 
significant abnormalities of laboratory values, concomitant medication use, vital signs, pain 
assessment and physical examination data in the Safety analysis set.
Adverse events: The AE verbatim descriptions (investigator terms from the CRF) will be 
classified into standardized medical terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). AEs will be considered treatment-emergent if they start on or any time 
after the first dose of investigational product until [ADDRESS_134120]. SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation will also be tabulated.
Other safety data: These data will be summarized by [CONTACT_120079]. Laboratory parameters 
will be categorized according to CTCAE v5.[ADDRESS_134121] baseline assessment. Laboratory data 
will be listed, and abnormal results will be flagged.

notification and review, within a reasonable time frame, by [CONTACT_1034], and cannot be made in 
violation of the Sponsor’s confidentiality restrictions or to the detriment of the Sponsor’s 
intellectual property rights.
Sponsor will register the study and post study results regardless of outcome on a publicly 
accessible website in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
11.9 RECORDS
Data collected at Screening and during the study will be recorded in the patient’s source 
documents and retained at the study site for all patients who sign informed consent. Patients 
who are enrolled in the study will have their data retained in the source documents at the site 
and also have their data entered into the eCRF. To maintain confidentiality, patients will be 
identified only by [CONTACT_120094].
The completed eCRFs will be transferred to the Sponsor (or designee). Copi[INVESTIGATOR_120023] (or designee). A compact disk containing the site 
eCRF data will be provided to the site at the completion of the study. All source documents, 
records, and reports will be retained by [CONTACT_113145] 21 CFR 312.62(c). 
The minimum retention time for study records will meet the strictest standard applicable to that 
site, as dictated by [CONTACT_120095], national, or regional laws or 
regulations. Prior to proceeding with destruction of records, the Investigator must notify the 
Sponsor in writing and receive written authorization from the Sponsor to destroy study records.
In addition, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any changes in the archival 
arrangements including but not limited to archival at an offsite facility or transfer of ownership 
if the Investigator leaves the site.
All primary data, or copi[INVESTIGATOR_20583] (e.g., laboratory records, eCRFs, data sheets, 
correspondence, photographs, and computer records), which are a result of the original 
observations and activities of the study and are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation 
of any study report, will be retained in the clinical site archives.
11.10 FINANCING AND INSURANCE
Financing and insurance of this study will be outlined in a separate agreement between CRO 
and the Sponsor.

ConfidentialAPPENDIX C SUMMARY OF RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID 
TUMORS (RECIST) V1.1
Disease response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) criteria (version 1.1). The following appendix summarizes the process for selecting 
baseline measurable lesions and deriving the appropriate response at subsequent imaging time 
points. For specific details related to the response criteria please refer to the published RECIST 
criteria (version 1.1) (Eisenhauer, 2009).
Establishing a Baseline Overall Tumor Burden:
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. The disease 
burden at baseline will be categorized into target and non-target lesions.
Target Lesions:
Identify a maximum of 5 target lesions (up to 2 target lesions per organ).
Target lesions must be measurable; where measurable is defined:
[ADDRESS_134135] (preferred) or MRI scan (or no less than 
double the slice thickness) for non-nodal lesions and ≥ 15 mm in short axis for 
nodal lesions
10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461]
[ADDRESS_134136] X-ray
NOTE: Regardless of the imaging modality blastic bone lesions will not be 
selected as target lesions. Lytic or mixed lytic-blastic lesions with a measurable 
soft tissue component ≥ 10 mm can be selected as target lesions.
NOTE: Lesions having undergone prior intervention (e.g., previous irradiation) 
will not be selected as target lesions unless there has been a demonstration of 
progress in the lesion.
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.
Calculate the sum of the diameters (SOD) of all target lesions.
For non-nodal lesions: the longest diameter should be included in the sum of diameters
For nodal lesions: the short axis measurement (i.e., widest dimension perpendicular to 
the long axis) should be included in the sum of diameters
Non-Target Lesions:
All remaining lesions (including pathological lymph nodes) are followed as non-target 
lesions. There is no limit to the number of non-target lesions that can be recorded at 
baseline. Baseline measurements are not required for non-target lesions.

ConfidentialEvaluation of Tumor Burden at Subsequent Assessments:
Please refer to the SoA (Table 1) for the timing of subsequent imaging assessments.
Target Lesions:
Target lesions are measured at every subsequent assessment and an overall SOD is calculated. 
Target lesions are assessed as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease 
(SD), Progressive Disease (PD), or Not All Evaluated (NAE) at every time point based on the 
calculated SOD.
Target Assessment Evaluation Definition
Complete Response (CR) CR is declared if ALL of the following are true for target lesions:
The disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions
Any pathological lymph nodes must have a reduction in short 
axis to <10 mm.
Partial Response (PR) PR is declared if there is a decrease of at least 30% in the SOD of 
target lesions compared to the baseline SOD of target lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD) PD is declared if ANY of the following are true for target lesions:
SOD of all target lesions increases at least 20% compared to the 
smallest SOD recorded from any prior assessment
NOTE: In addition to the relative increase at least 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
OR
The appearance of one or more new lesions.
Stable Disease (SD) SD is declared if target lesion assessment does not meet criteria for 
PR, PD, or CR.
Non-Target Lesions:
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed qualitatively at subsequent assessments. Non-target lesions are 
assessed as CR, PD, non-CR/non-PD (NCNP), or NAE at every time point.
Non-Target Assessment Evaluation Definition
Complete Response (CR) CR is declared if ALL of the following are true for non-target lesions:
Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.
All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD (NCNP) NCNP is declared when persistence of one or more non-target 
lesion(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits is observed.
Progressive Disease (PD) PD is declared if ANY of the following are true for non-target lesions:
Unequivocal Progression of existing non-target lesions.
NOTE: Unequivocal Progression of non-target disease is 
defined as an overall level of substantial worsening in non-

Page [ADDRESS_134137] increase in the size 
of one or more non-target lesion(s) is usually not sufficient to 
quality for unequivocal progression. The designation of overall 
progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease 
in the face of SD or PR of target disease should therefore be 
extremely rare.
OR
The appearance of one or more new lesions.
New Lesions:
The determination of new lesions should be unequivocal and not be attributable to differences in 
the scanning technique, change in modality, or findings thought to represent something other 
than tumor. This is particularly important when the patient’s target lesions show PR or CR.
A lesion identified at a subsequent time point in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. This underscores the 
importance of scanning all anatomical locations that are suspected to contribute to disease 
burden at baseline. 
Overall Time Point Response Assignment at Subsequent Assessments:
Once the Target-Lesion, Non-Target Lesion, and New Lesion Assessments have been completed 
for a subsequent imaging assessment, an Overall Time Point Response may be assigned.

US and Canada
Section 4.1
Inclusion no. 9:  WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for 
the duration of the treatment with AL101 plus [ADDRESS_134138]-treatment completion.
Inclusion no. 10: Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions 
for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with AL101 plus 90 days (duration 
of sperm turnover) post-treatment completion.
Section 7.3:
AL101 may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Furthermore, it is not known if AL101 has 
transient AEs on the composition of sperm. Non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be 
enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to 
conceive. Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal 
(a woman who has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), 
or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study. The two birth control methods can 
be either two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. 
Patients should start using birth control for 30 days prior to treatment initiation (Cycle 1, Day 1) 
and throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_134139].
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by 
[CONTACT_3969]), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide. Appropriate hormonal 
contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an 
estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or 
intramuscular agents).
Patients should be informed that taking the investigational product may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. To participate in the study, 
they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of the study 
and study period up to [ADDRESS_134140]. Reporting of 
Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor Medical Monitor is required (see Section 8.6). If there is 
any question that a patient will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that

Confidential2. MHRA requested clarification on contraceptive language for male and female patients.
Section 4.1
Inclusion no. 9: WOCBP must agree to use a highly effective birth control during the study 
(prior to the first dose with AL101 and for [ADDRESS_134141] dose), if conception is possible 
during this interval. Female patients are considered to not be of childbearing potential if they 
have a history of hysterectomy, or are post-menopausal defined as no menses for 12 months 
without an alternative medical cause.
Inclusion no. 10: Male patients with partners who are WOCBP should use a combination of the 
methods specified in Section 7.[ADDRESS_134142], unless permanently sterile by [CONTACT_25297].
Section 7.3:
AL101 may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Furthermore, it is not known if AL101 has 
transient AEs on the composition of sperm. Non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be 
enrolled if they are willing to use a high effective method of birth control or are considered 
highly unlikely to conceive. Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 
2) postmenopausal (a woman who has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be considered 
postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study. Patients should 
start using birth control for 30 days prior to treatment initiation (Cycle 1, Day 1) and throughout 
the study period up to [ADDRESS_134143].
The following are considered highly effective method of contraception:
For women of childbearing potential, including female study participants and partners of male 
participants, effective contraception is defined as follows:
combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:
-oral
-intravaginal
-transdermal
progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:
-oral
-injectable
-implantable

intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)
bilateral tubal occlusion
vasectomized partner with documentation of the success of the vasectomy
complete abstinence from heterosexual intercourse (periodic abstinence is not a safe 
method)
Male patients with partners who are women of childbearing potential should use a combination 
of the above specified methods for the women along with a male condom during the study and 
for [ADDRESS_134144] may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. To participate in the study, 
they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of the study 
and study period up to [ADDRESS_134145]. Reporting of 
Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor Medical Monitor is required (see Section 8.6). If there is 
any question that a patient will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that 
patient should not enter the study.
[LOCATION_009]
ANSM require that contraception will be used for 120 days (4 months) post last dose of AL101, 
therefore the following sections were modified and are to be followed in [LOCATION_009]:
Section 4.1
Inclusion no. 9: WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the 
duration of the treatment with AL101 and for 120 days (4 months) after the last dose of AL101.
Inclusion no. 10: Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions 
for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with AL101 and for 120 days 
(4 months) after last dose of AL101
Section 7.3:
AL101 may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Furthermore, it is not known if AL101 has 
transient AEs on the composition of sperm. Non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be 
enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to 
conceive. Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal 
(a woman who  has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), 
or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study. The two birth control methods can 
be either two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. 
Patients should start using birth control for 30 days prior to treatment initiation (Cycle 1, Day 1) 
and throughout the study period up to 120 days (4 months) after the last dose of investigational 
product.

contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an 
estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or 
intramuscular agents).
Patients should be informed that taking the investigational product may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. To participate in the study,

6 mg QW on patients’ quality of 
life.
Synopsis and Section 3 Study Design
Add sequential Cohort 2 (6 mg once 
weekly; QW) and clarify enrollment 
process.Study expansion and higher 
dose (while adhering to set 
safety toxicity management 
guidelines), may improve 
efficacy and maintain patient’s 
safety.
The current results in patients 
with ACC suggest that a higher 
dose of AL101 may be well 
tolerated in this patient 
population particularly with the 
use of steroids and other toxicity 
management guidelines. Prior 
studies suggest that the increase 
to [ADDRESS_134146] 
and this may result in improved 
efficacy in this difficult to treat 
patient population.Protocol V3.0,

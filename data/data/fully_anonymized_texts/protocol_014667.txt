STUDY DESIGN:  
KO-TIP-007 is an international, multicenter, open -label  singl e- arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_108516]. The re are two 
sub-studies, not intended for comparison  (1) an  interventional  open label , single arm , pi[INVESTIGATOR_598707] (AIM -HN) and  (2) an 
observational study to evaluate  the impact of HRAS mut ations on response to first line systemic  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_598692] (SEQ -HN).  
AIM -HN, includes HNSCC subjects with HRAS mutations . AIM -HN subjects will receive 
treatment with tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598708] -TIP-[ADDRESS_792036] line treatment data collected as well.  
The study design is shown in  Figure 1 . 
Figure 1: KO -TIP-007 Study Design  
   
• AIM -HN 
AIM-HN will enroll patients with head and neck tumors of confirmed squamous histology with 
HRAS mutations . Subjects must have failed (e.g. tumor progression, clinical deterioration, or 
recurrence ) their most recent prior therapy, and at least one prior line  of systemic platinum -based 
therapy  (the most recent prior and platinum -based  therapy may be the same regimen).  However,  
subjects who, at the judgment of the investigator, are considered not to be candidates to receive 
standard therapy with a platinum -containing regimen  may also be enrolled  (further detailed in 
Section  4.6).  The primary objective of AIM -HN is to determine the ORR of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598709] a VAF ≥20%, as assessed by  [CONTACT_223228].     

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_792037] measurable disease that meets the criteria for 
selection as a target l esion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (R ECIST) 
v1.1. The presence of at least one measurable target lesion per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_792038] one measurable target lesion 
confirmed by [CONTACT_598807] -HN.  
HNSCC d iagnosis by [CONTACT_598808] ; however,  all subjects must 
provide pathology  material for central pathology review.  Central c onfirmatio n of pathological 
diagnosis of HNSCC will be required for inclusion  of subjects in the  per-protocol  analysis set .  
Subjects in whom a diagnosis of HNSCC is not confirmed by [CONTACT_598809] -to-treat (mITT) analysis set .  
All AIM -HN enrolled subjects must have a known missense HRAS tumor mutation based on  
centralized testing  or other HRAS test used by [CONTACT_598810]. HRAS status  should be assessed on tumor obtained subsequent to the most recent pri or 
therapy in order to obtain  the most recent tumor biology; if tumor tissue that does not meet this 
criterion must be used (e.g. risk of biopsy is too high, patient refuses  new biopsy ), the 
investigator  should document  the reason . If several samples are a vailable, HRAS testing should 
be performed in the most recently obtained tumor sample.  To facilitate development of 
appropriate diagnostic testing, all subjects must provide enough tumor material for confirmation 
of HRAS status by [CONTACT_35970] . This tissue should be from the same source as that used for pre -
screening, or the reason that is not possible documented.  Subjects who were enrolled in the 
study based on HRAS mutation using  a Sponsor approved test, but in whom a missense HRAS 
mutation is  not confirmed by [CONTACT_12115] , may continue to receive study treatment.  SEQ -
HN subjects who were initially identified as w ild type HRAS but in whom a n HRAS mutation is 
later detected during the course of their standard therapy, will become eligible to screen for  
AIM -HN.   
AIM -HN e nrolled s ubjects will receive tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598710] a dose of 600 mg, orally with a 
meal  twice a day (bid) for 7 days in alternating weeks (Days 1 -7 and 15 -21) in 28-day cycles.  
Stepwise [ADDRESS_792039] (IDMB).  Investigator assessment 
of tumor response will also be collected  and reported  as a supportive analysis . Assessments will 
be performed at screening and approx imately every [ADDRESS_792040]’s 
participation in AIM -HN; thereafter, tumor response assessment should occur  approximately 
every [ADDRESS_792041]’s consent to study procedures .  Local 
investigator evaluation of tumor assessment will guide on -study treatment decisions, including 
decisions to stop study treatment due to progressive disease.   
Upon disease progression, all subjects will be followed approximately every 12  weeks for 
survival and the use of subsequent therapy until either death or End of Study (up to [ADDRESS_792042]  in AIM -HN, see Section 6.7.1 ), whichever occurs first.  
All subjects will be  followed -up for safety  through  the End of Treatment visit which occurs 
approximately [ADDRESS_792043] . Additional safety follow -up may be 
conducted if unresolved toxicity is present at th is End of Treatment visit.  The IDMB will provide 
periodic evaluations of safety and other data to ensure adequate benefit/risk  as well as  the 
validity and scientific merit of the study.  
An overview of the AIM -HN sub-study design is shown in  Figure 2 . 
Figure 2: AIM -HN Design  
   
• SEQ -HN 
SEQ -HN is an observational sub-study  
  Demographics, 
disease history, information on prior anti -cancer treatments and outcomes to prior treatments for 
HNSCC will be collected from  all enrolled subjects . At least approximately [ADDRESS_792044] extent possible according to 
pre-defined patient characteristics. If necessary, a dditional follow up of the matched HRAS 
wildtype HNSCC patients enrolled into SEQ -HN may continue until all AIM -HN objectives are 
completed and KO -TIP-007 end of study is reached. Control patients with HNSCC with  wildtype  
HRAS will not receive tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598711] -HN; however, 
they may be compensated for their participation in data collection, blood sampling, screening 
and follow up procedures according to institutional guidelines.  
An overview of the SEQ -HN design is shown in Figure 3 . 
Figure 3: SEQ -HN Design   
  
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS PLANNED :  
In AIM -HN, a t least [ADDRESS_792045] criteria for inclusion in the per -protocol analysis set include: received at least one dose of 
tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734], confirmed measurable disease at baseline per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_792046] baseline disease 
assessment (e.g. tumor assessment visit ). In SEQ -HN, approximately  an additional  225 patients 
with HNSCC but without detected HRAS mutations will also be enrolled . A subset of the  
wildtype  HRAS subjects will be selected as a matched -control subset to those  subjects with:  
• HRAS mutant tumors  enrolled as part of AIM -HN,

CONFIDENTIAL   • HRAS mutant tumors that do not enroll in AIM -HN, but have 1L data collected 
during  the pre-screening period  
SUBJECT SELECTION :  
Inclusion Criteria : AIM -HN 
For i nclusion of a subject in the tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598712]  (AIM -HN), all of the 
following inclusion criteria must be fulfilled . If a subject does initially not meet any inclusion 
criteria, the subject may be re -screened at a later time :  
1. At least 18 years of age . 
2. Histologically confirmed head and neck cancer  (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, sinonasal , 
nasopharyngeal,  or unknown primary)  of squamous histology  not amenable to local therapy 
with curative intent (surgery or radiation therapy with o r without chemotherapy). Enrol lment 
may proceed with local diagnosis but all subjects must consent to provide tumor tissue for a 
central pathology review.  
3. Documented treatment failure from most recent prior therapy (e.g. tumor progression, 
clinical deterio ration, or recurrence) , and from at least one prior platinum -containing 
regimen , in any treatment setting . The most recent prior and platinum -based  therapy may be 
the same regimen. Those subjects  who, at the judgment of the investigator, are considered 
clinically unsuitable to receive standard platinum -containing regimen , may also be enrolled 
and the reason  for clinical  unsuitability recorded.  There is no limit on the number of prior 
lines of therapy.  
4. Known tumor missense HRAS mutation  detected by  [CONTACT_40901] (NGS) or 
any other methodology approved by [CONTACT_1034] . Variant allele frequency (VAF) needs to be 
determined and must be available.  HRAS status should  be assessed on tumor tissue obtained  
subsequent to the most recent prior therapy  so that the most  accurate tumor biology is 
evaluated . If tumor tissue that does not meet this criterion must be used (e.g. risk of new 
biopsy is too high, patient refuses new biopsy), the investigator should document the reason.  
Enrol lment may proceed with the identification of a missense HRAS mutation using a test 
preferred by [CONTACT_598811] -screening , but all 
subjects must consent to provide tumor tissue for central HRAS confirmation .  
 
 
5. Measurable disease by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 (Appendix I) that meets the criteria for selection as a

The subject must meet/continue to meet these criteria at the time of first dosing, as 
confirmed by [CONTACT_598813] 72 hours of C1D1.  
11. Acceptable hematologic status:  
a) ANC  1000 cells/μL.  
b) Platelet count  75,000/μL.  
c) Hemoglobin  8.0 g/dL.  
The subject must meet/continue to meet these criteria at the time of first dosing, as 
confirmed by [CONTACT_598814] [ADDRESS_792051] be:

subject’s signs and symptoms. If subje cts are allergic to IV contrast, MRI scans or non -contrast CT may be used. Subjects 
with contrast allergy or renal insufficiency may use non -contrast CT or MRI, whichever is required to adequately assess all 
disease.  The one exception where MRI would not b e recommended is for the evaluation of parenchymal lung metastases.  In 
this instance, CT would be preferred.  If imaging of the brain is indicated, MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium 
should be performed for optimal evaluation of the brain.  If M RI is medically contraindicated, CT of the brain with and 
without contrast would be suggested.  Guidelines for imaging and instructions for transmission of the images to the IRF will 
be provided to each study site.

Amendment 3, 9 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL   4 BACKGROUND  
Brief information on tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598724]; more extensive information is 
provided in the Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598725]’s Brochure . 
4.1 Investigational Agent  
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734] (R115777; Zarnestra™)  
4.2 Study Rationale  
4.2.1 Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma  
Head and nec k squamous cell carcinoma accounts for more than 550,000 cases annually, 
worldwide  (Leemans 2011 ) with incidence rates of certain subtypes (oropharyngeal) on the rise  
(Chaturvedi 2011 ). Carcinogen (tobacco, alcohol) exposure and infection with the human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_598726] (HPV) are described as the two  major eti ological causes of HNSCC . Differences 
in prognoses have been reported for HPV -negat ive and HPV -positive HNSCC , with HPV 
negativity  being associated with worse clinical outcome  (Leemans 2011 ). 
Genomic structural alterations are commonly seen i n HNSCC . Both HPV -positive and HPV -
negative tumors harbor amplific ations of 1q, 3q, 5p and 8q and deletions of 3p,  5q, and 11q . The 
amplification of 3q26/[ADDRESS_792072], in HPV -negative tum ors 9p21.3 is 
commonly deleted while 11q13 , containing ANO1, CCND1 and FADD , and  11q22 , containing 
BIRC2 and YAP1 are amplified ( Aung 2016 ).  
From a biological perspective, the recurrent CDKN2A deletions and CCND1 amplification seen 
in HPV -negative tumors and E2F1 amplifications in HPV -positive tumors indicate that loss  of 
cell cycle regulation is a fundamental event in HNSCC carcinogenesis. Also, the importance of 
the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway s, particularly in HPV -negative HNSCC,  is highlighted 
by [CONTACT_598818], HRAS mutation and PIK3CA related alterations ( Aung 2016 ). Of note, 
it has been suggested that HRAS signals almost exclusively through PI3K -AKT and not through 
MAPK in HNS CC ( Endhardt 2014 ). TP53 is also frequently mutated in HPV -negative  cases 
whereas TP53 alterations are infrequent in HPV -positive tumors. However, a  small subset of 
HPV -negative , frequently  oral cavity , carcinoma s do not hav e TP53 mutations and harbo r 
activating HRAS mutations with or without inactivating CASP8 mutations , constituting a distinct 
subset of HNSCC ( TCGA 2015 ).  
The relevance of HRAS mutations is highlighted by [CONTACT_598819] (FTIs).  Although FTI s prevent more than [ADDRESS_792073] due to the compensative 
prenylation through type 1 geranylgeranyl transferase ( Baines 2011 ; Berndt 2011 ; Takashima 
2013 ).  Among RAS isoforms, inhibition of the farnesylation of KRAS and NRAS leads to their 
geranylgeranylation and unchanged membra ne localization.  HRAS cannot be 
geranylgeranylated and its membrane localization and cellular function is suppressed by [CONTACT_598820] 
(Whyte 1997 ).  Consequently, HRAS driven tumors are very sensitive to FTIs.  
4.2.2 Mechanism of Action  
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598727] a potent and selective inhibitor of farnesyltransferase (FTase), an enzyme 
responsible for adding a farnesyl group to proteins.   
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598728].  Early 
characterization of tip ifarnib demonstrated that it caused de -farnesylation and loss of membrane 
localization of HRAS, but not KRAS or NRAS ( Lerner 1997 ; Mahgoub 1999 ).  Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598729]3T3 cells with an IC 50 of 1.7 nM but did 
not inhibit parental NIH3T3 cells up to a concentration of 500 nM ( End 2001 ).  Consistent with a 
specific activity against HRAS, tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598730] a 53 human tumor cell panel with IC 50 of 1.7 nM and 5.2 nM, whereas cell 
lines with KRAS and NRAS mutations displayed a wide range sensitivity (~ 10 nM to > 500 
nM) ( End 2001 ).   
In preclinic al animal models of HRAS driven cancer, tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598731].  In mouse cell line xenograft models, tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598732] 86% tumor growth at 25mg/kg 
bid dose in HRAS mutated model while inhibiting only 10% tumor growth at the s ame dose in 
KRAS mutated model ( End 2001 ).  FTIs have also shown strong efficacy in several HRAS 
driven transgenic mouse models ( Kohl 1995 ; Barrington 1998 ; Trempus 2000 ; Chen 2014 ).  
Further, in a methylnitrosourea induced rat mammary tumor model, 90% of tumors with HRAS 
mutation showed complete regression upon tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598713], whereas the non -HRAS mutant 
tumors showed variable responses ( Yao 2006 ).  
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598733] (PDX) models. PDX models are thought to be more predictive of clinical activity 
because they are transplanted directly from the patient into host animals without in vitro culture 
and hence retain the properties of the original tumor more faithfully. As shown in  Figure 4 , 
tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598734] 80mg/kg bid was highly active in PDX models of several HRAS -
mutant HN SCC s inducing tumor stasis, partial responses and some complete regressions of 
established tumors. Importantly, the robust antitumor activity with tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598735] (1mg/kg once weekly, QW) and methotrexate 
(10mg/kg twice weekly, BIW) ( Figure 5 ).

Figure 5: Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598737] -Resistant HRAS -Mutant HNSCC  PDX Models  
 
Head and neck tumors with HRAS mutations have previously been reported to be resistant to 
cetuximab and erlotinib in vitro and in vivo ( Rampi[INVESTIGATOR_17174] 2014 ; Hah 2014 ; Wang 2014 ).  An 
intriguing study recently reported employed serial liquid biopsies from HN SCC  patients to reveal 
that acquired resistance to cetuxim ab in the clinic is in some cases associated with the early 
appearance of de novo  HRAS mutations ( Braig 2016 ).   
4.2.[ADDRESS_792074] cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer,  
melanoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), myelodysplastic syndromes  (MDS) , multiple 
myeloma, urothelial tract transitional cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung 
cancer ( NSCLC ) (Adjei 2003 , Cohen 2003 , Johnston 2003 , Alsina 2004 , Heymach  2004 , 
Kurzrock 2004 , Rao 2004 , Rosenberg 2005 , Hong, 2011 , Gajewski 2012 ). While sporadic tumor 
responses were observed in some of these studies, the level of activity in the absence of a 
molecular selection strategy did not support further development of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598738] a single ag ent. 
Preclinical data indicated that tumor models carrying HRAS mutations are highly sensitive to 
FTIs. The reason for this selectivity is potentially the fact that, contrary to KRAS and NRAS,

5-fluorour acil) with and without  cetuximab , remains an important therapy  (Vermorken 2008 ). 
Other approved systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_598741] , 
and their use as single agents and in combination in the front -line setting continue to increase  
(KEYNOTE -048; Ferris, 2016 ). Overall response rates to systemic therapy in this indication are 
<20% with a median overall survival of 5 -8 months in the 2 nd line setting ( Seiwert 2016 , Ferris 
2016 ) emphasizing the significant unmet need for effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_598742].   
HNSCC with HRAS mutations have been shown to be resistant to EGF R inhibition with 
cetuximab and erlotinib in vitro and in vivo ( Rampi[INVESTIGATOR_17174] 2014 , Hah 2014 , Wang 2014 ).  
Furthermore, a recent study employing serial liquid biopsies from HNSCC patients prior to and 
at progression on cetuximab treatment demonstrated that acquired resistance to cetuximab is 
commonly associated with the early appearance of HRAS mutations ( Braig 2016 ). This last

CONFIDENTIAL   observation also su ggests that additional cases of HRAS -driven HNSCC may arise as a result of 
treatment with anti -EGFR therapy. Additionally, in a comparison of TTP between patients with 
no HRAS mutation (N=48) and HRAS  mutants ( n=7), a statistically significant better progn osis 
for patients with no HRAS mutation (P =0.04)  and a trend toward improved overall survival was 
demonstrated ( Rampi[INVESTIGATOR_17174] 2014 ).  These published data compliment  preliminary  data from study 
KO-TIP-[ADDRESS_792076] treatment s of HNSCC .   
Initial data from  the ongoing KO-TIP-001 in which tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598743] a starting dose of

malignancies, doses from 25 to 1300 mg bid were explored. No MTD was identified. Dose -
limiting t oxicity of grade 3 neuropathy was observed in one patient and grade 2 fatigue in 4 of 6 
patients treated with 1300 mg bid. Fatigue, that was not dose -limiting, was observed at the prior 
dose level (800 mg bid). Of note, myelosuppression which was the most common toxicity in the 
21-day schedule (45% at 300 mg bid, Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598725]’s Brochure 201 8), was limited with 
the [ADDRESS_792080] of the weekly  schedule studies ( Lara 2005 ), the starting dose was 300 mg bid with 
300 mg dose escalation s to a maximum planned dose of 1800 mg bid. Two of 6 patients with 
non-hematological tumors in dose level 3 (900 mg bid) developed grade [ADDRESS_792081] 1 year with stable disease (12, 13, 16 and 17 months). Five grade 3 events of 
myelosuppression (out of 21 patients) were described by [CONTACT_598821] (doses not indicated) that 
were not considered dose limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) and hematological toxicity was described as 
moderate and manageable.

Only the Sponsor, upon consultation with the principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_598747]. The Sponsor will issue a formal protocol amendment to implement any changes. The 

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_792084]’s safety is compromised without 
immediate action. In these circumstances, immediate approval of the chairman of the  
Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  (IRB/IEC ) must be sought, and the 
Investigator should inform the Sponsor and the full IRB/IEC within 2 working days after the 
emergency has occurred.  
The IRB/EC must review and approve all protocol amendments. Protocol amendments that have 
an impact on subject risk  or the study objectives or  require revision of the informed consent form  
(ICF), must receive approval from the IRB/IEC prior to their implementation.  
When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden

6.2 Study Design  
KO-TIP-007 is an international, multicenter, open -label, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397], with two non -
comparative sub -studies: (1) an interventional open label, single arm, pi[INVESTIGATOR_598752] (AIM -HN) and (2) an observa tional study to 

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_792087] line systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_598692] 
(SEQ -HN).  
 AIM -HN, includes HNSCC subjects with HRAS mutations. AIM -HN subjects will receive 
treatment with tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598753]-study will address the primary objective of 
the KO -TIP-[ADDRESS_792088] failed (e.g.  tumor progression, clinical deterioration, or 
recurrence  their most recent prior therapy, and at least one prior line of systemic platin um-based 
therapy (the most recent prior and platinum -based therapy may be the same regimen). However, 
subjects who, at the judgment of the investigator, are considered not to be candidates to receive 
standard therapy with a platinum -containing regimen may also be enrolled (further detailed in 
Section 4.6 ).  The primary objective of AIM -HN is to determine the ORR of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598754] a VAF≥20%, as assessed by [CONTACT_223228].     
To participate in AIM -HN, all subjects must have measurable disease that meets the criteria for 
selection as a target l esion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
v1.1. The presence of at least one measurable target lesion per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_792089] one measurable target lesion 
confirmed by [CONTACT_598823] -HN.  
HNSCC diagnosis by [CONTACT_598824] ; however,  all 
subjects must provide pathology material for central pathology review.  Confirmation of 
pathological diagnosis of HNSCC will be required for inclusion of subjects in the per -protocol  

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_792090] recent tumor biology; if tumor tissue that does not meet this 
criterion must be used (e.g. risk o f biopsy is too high, patient refuses new biopsy), the 
Investigator  should document the reason. If several samples are available, HRAS testing should 
be performed in the most recently obtained tumor sample.   All subjects must provide enough 
tumor material for confirmation of HRAS status by [CONTACT_35970] . This tissue should be from the 
same source as that used for pre -screening, or the reason that is not possible documented.  
Subjects who were enrolled in the study based on HRAS mutation using a Sponsor approved test, 
but in whom a missense HRAS mutation is  not confirmed by [CONTACT_200029], may continue to 
receive study treatment. SEQ -HN subjects who were initially identified as wild type HRAS but 
in whom an HRAS mutation is later detected during the course of their standard therapy, will 
become eligible to enroll in AIM -HN.   
AIM -HN enrolled s ubjects will receive tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598710] a dose of 600 mg, orally with a 
meal  twice a day (bid) for 7 days in alternating weeks (Days 1 -7 and 15 -21) in 28-day cycles.  
Stepwise [ADDRESS_792091] (IDMB).  Investigator assessment 
of tumor response will also be collected and reported  as a supportive analysis . Assessments will 
be performed at screening and approxi mately every [ADDRESS_792092]’s 
participation in AIM -HN; thereafter, tumor response assessment should occur  approximately 
every [ADDRESS_792093]’s consent to study procedure s.  Local 
investigator evaluation of tumor assessment will guide on -study treatment decisions, including 
decisions to stop study treatment due to progressive disease.   
Upon disease progression, all subjects will be followed approximately every 12 weeks fo r 
survival and the use of subsequent therapy until either death or End of Study (up to [ADDRESS_792094] in AIM -HN, see Section 6.7.1 ), whichever occurs first.  

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_792095] . Additional safety follow -
up may be conducted if unresolved toxicity is present at this End of Treatment visit. The IDMB  
will provide periodic evaluatio ns of safety and other data to ensure adequate benefit/risk  as well 
as the validity and scientific merit of the study.  
An overview of the AIM -HN design is shown in  Figure [ADDRESS_792096] extent possible according to pre-defined patient 
characteristics. If necessary, additional follow up of the matched HRAS  wildtype HNSCC 
patients enrolled into SEQ -HN may continue until all AIM -HN objectives are completed and 
KO-TIP-007 end of study is reached. Control patients with HNSCC with wildtype HRAS  will 
not receive tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598755] n in SEQ -HN; however, they  may be 
compensated for their participation in data collection, blood sampling, screening and follow up 
procedures according to institutional guidelines.  
An overview of the SEQ -HN design is shown in  Figure 3 . 
6.3 Randomization  
KO-TIP-007 is a nonrandomized study. S ubjects enrolled as part of AIM -HN will receive 
tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598710] a dose of 600 mg, orally with food, bid for 7 days in alternating weeks 
(Days 1 -7 and 15 -21) in 28-day cycles.   
SEQ -HN is noninterventional and used for data collection in subjects with HNSCC without 
HRAS mutations .  Subjects enrolled in SEQ -HN will not receive tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598713].  
This is an open label study with no placebo or comparators.

occurs (see  Section 7.3 ). Kura  Oncology , Inc. or  its designee will provide the study site with a 
supply of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598767].  Upon disease progression, all 
subjects will be followed approxima tely every 12 weeks for survival and the use of subsequent 
therapy  until either death or End of Study (see Section 6.7.1 ), whichever occurs first.  
Subjects enrolled into  SEQ -HN will be followed through initiation of second li ne therapy, death, 
or consent withdraw, whichever occurs first. Additional follow up of the matched HRAS 
wildtype HNSCC patients enrolled into SEQ -HN may continue until all AIM -HN objectives are 
completed and End of Study  (see Section 6.7.1 ) is reached . 

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_792103]’s safety follow -up assessment  (End of Treatment 
visit)  performed approxi mately [ADDRESS_792104] .  At the time of End of Study, provisions will 
be made to transition all remaining AIM -HN subjects who demonstrate sustained clinical benefit 
beyond the end of the study to other means of continued treatment with tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598768] , e.g. single patient treatment protocol , other clinical trial or 
expanded access protocol , as allowed by [CONTACT_1769] .   
6.7.2 Premature Dis continuation of the Trial  
This trial may be discontinued prematurely in the event of any of the following:  
• IDMB recommendation based on observed safety leading to an unfavorable risk -benefit 
of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734].  
• IDMB recommendation based on futility criteria.  
• New information leading to a judgment of unfavorable risk -benefit of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598769], e.g. due to evidence of inefficacy of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598770], 
occurrence of significant previously unknown adverse reactions or unexpectedly high 
intensity or incidence of previously known adverse reactions, or other unfavorable safety 
findings in the HRAS mutant tumor subject population. Evidence of inefficacy may arise 
from this trial or from other trials and unfavorable safety f indings may arise from clinical 
or non -clinical examinations, e.g. toxicology.  
• Sponsor’s decision that continuation of the trial is unjus tifiable for medical or ethical 
reasons.  
• Poor enrollment of subjects making completion of the trial within an acceptabl e time 
frame  unlikely.  
• Discontinuation of development of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598771] .  
• Request by a Health Authority . 
Health Authorities and IRBs/IECs will be informed about the discontinuation of the trial in 
accordance with applicable regulations. In the case of premature discontinuation of the study, the 
investigations scheduled for the End of Treatment visit should be performed and the appropriate 
electronic case report form (eCRF) section completed.

Screening for HRAS mutation can occur at any time prior to initiating tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598785] -TIP-007, e.g. pre -
screening for HRAS mutations may be performed in subjects currently receiving platinum -based 
or other 1 firsttherapy.  Because a tumor’s biology changes over time and in response to anti -
cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it is recommended that testing is performed on tumor tissue obtained 
subsequent to the most recent prior; if it is not possible to obtain tissue meeting th is criterion 
(clinical risks too high, patient refusal, etc), the reason must be documented .  If several tumor 
samples are available, HRAS testing should be performed on the most recently obtained tumor 
sample.   
Subjects are required to have a missense HRA S mutation for enrollment in AIM -HN, the

part of KO -TIP-007: 
• If HRAS mutation data were obtained subsequ ent to the most recent prior therapy , and  
obtained using a Sponsor approved test, these data may be used for enrollment.  Re-biopsy 
should be considered for tumor tissue not meeting th is requirement. If re-biopsy is not 
possible, the clinical justification should be recorded . Procedures as outlined in Section 
9.1.2  regarding obtaining tumor material for potential confirmatory testing at a central 
laboratory should be followed.  
• If HRAS mutation data were obtained us ing a test which is not approved by [CONTACT_1034], 
these data may not be used for enrollment.  In such cases, HRAS testing procedures 
outlined in Section 9.1.2  should be followed for study eligibility.  
In addition, the following  procedures are to be performed in all subjects with known HRAS

10 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
Table 1 , Table 2 , and Table 3  summarize  the study required  evaluations.  
10.1 Efficacy Parameters  
The following subsections apply only to subjects participating in AIM -HN. 
10.1.1  Efficacy Variables  
Objective response (complete response and partial response) as determined by [CONTACT_423]’s best 
tumor response, duration of response, and time to progress ion will be assessed using RECIST 
v1.1(Appendix I ) by [CONTACT_223228].  Confirmation of response is required.   An IRF charter  providing  the 
specific procedures  will be filed with IRB s/IECs and regulatory autho rities .  
Local/Investigator tumor response assessment s will be collected and used to inform patient care 
decisions .   
 
  
10.1.2  Method and Timing   
Radiological assessments of the  tumor lesions will be made at screening (within [ADDRESS_792151] ug administration on Cycle 1 Day 1) and at least once approximately every 8 weeks 
(± 5 days)  for 12  months , thereafter once approximately every 12 weeks  (± 5 days).   Additional 
tumor assessments may be conducted at the judgment of the Investigator.  

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_792152] withdraw s their  consent to study procedures .  
Radiological assessments may also be conducted at treatment discontinuation (End of Treatment 
visit) if the reason for the treatment termination is other than disease progression and a tumor 
assessment w as not done within 8 weeks  before treatment discontinuation ( assessment must be 
conducted before subsequent  anti-tumor therapy is started).  Scans at the End of Treatment visit 
will be also conducted if required to confirm response to treatment.  
Lesions to be included in the t umor assessments should follow RECIST v1.1  (See Appendix I). 
CT scan  with a contrast agent is the preferred imaging method and the same technique should be 
used at screening and post -treatment assessments. CT scan coverage at screening  should 
encompass scans of the neck (including the skull base), chest and abdomen (includin g the liver 
and adrenals).  Any other areas of disease involvement should be scanned based on the subject’s 
signs and symptoms.  
Subjects with contrast allergy or renal insufficiency may use non -contrast CT or MRI, whichever 
is required to adequately assess  all disease. For subjects who develop a contraindication to 
contrast after screening scans are performed with a contrast agent, the decision to use non -
contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non -enhanced) should be based on tumor type, anatomic 
location of disea se and should be optimized to allow for comparison to the prior scans if 
possible.  The one exception where MRI would not be recommended is for the evaluation of 
parenchymal lung metastases.  In this instance, CT would be preferred.  If imaging of the brai n is 
indicated, MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium should be performed for optimal 
evaluation of the brain.  If MRI is medically contraindicated, CT of the brain with and without 
contrast would be suggested.  Guidelines for imaging and instructio ns for transmission of the 
images to IRF will be provided to each study site.

Additional variables to be examined as a part of this study include somatic  mutations in 
submitted tumor tissue  and plasma samples  
 (Witzig 2017 ).  These variables may be examined in subjects enrolled in AIM -HN and in 
subjects enrolled in SEQ -HN.  
Genetic testing will be/ was performed using Sponsor approved local tests or through central 
testing designated by [CONTACT_1034].  Samples may be submitted to a laboratory CRO if deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_598843] . Genetic markers (mutation, gene 
expression) include , but are not limited to , a panel of oncogenes common ly mutated in HNSCC 
or other alterations that could be relevant for the biology or treatment of HNSCC.   Gene 
expression analyses may include  the characterization of alternative gene spliced transcripts, post -
transcriptional modifications, gene fusion s, changes in gene expression  and u nsupervised gene 
expression analyses .

Complete, accurate and consistent data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the reporting  
period (defined be low) will be reported on an ongoing basis in the appropri ate section of the 
eCRF. Among these AEs, all SAEs must be additionally documented and reported using the 
Serious Adverse Event Report Form . It is important that each AE report include a description of 
the event, its duration (onset and  resolution dates, including time when it is important to assess 
the time of AE  onset relative to the recorded treatment administration time), its severity, its 
relationship with  the study  treatment, any other potential  causal factors, any treatment given or 
other action taken  (including dose modification or discontinuation of the IPs) and its outcome. In 
addition,  serious cases should be identified,  and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented.

Only pregnancies considered by [CONTACT_598845] (e.g. resulting from  
a drug interaction with a contraceptive medication) are considered as AEs. However,  all 
pregnancies with an estimated conception date during the study safety period must be recorded 
by [CONTACT_43978]/section of the eCRF. The same rule applies to  pregnancies in 
female subjects and in female partners of male subjects. The Investi gator must  notify the 
Sponsor in an expedited manner of any pregnancy using the Pregnancy Report Form,  which must 
be transmitted according to the same process a s described for SAE reporting . 
Investigators must actively follow up, document and report on the  outcome of all these  
pregnancies, even if the subjects are withdrawn from the study . The Investigator must notify the 
Sponsor of these outcomes using the Pregnancy Report Form,  and in case of abnormal outcome, 
the Adverse Event Report Form when the subjec t sustains an event and the Parent -Child/Fetus 
Report Form when the child/fetus sustains an event.  
Any abnormal outcome must be reported in an expedited manner, while normal outcomes must

[IP_ADDRESS]  Urinalysis  
Macroscopic a ssessment of the amount of protein, glucose, white blood cells and blood will be 
conducted. If abnormalities are noted, these will be recorded,  and a microscopic analysis 
conducted and recorded. If at any time, the subject’s serum creatinine is ≥ Grade 2, then a serum 
chemistry, microscopic urinalysis including the measurement of protein, glucose, blood, white 
blood cells will be conducted. If abnormalities are noted, then spot urine sodium, protein and 
creatinine should be performed to assess fracti onal so dium excretion (plasma creatinine x urine 
sodium / plasma sodium x urine creati nine) and urine protein/creatinine ratio (urine protein 
mg/urine creatinine mg ratio).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy Testing  
Pregnancy testing will be performed in females of child -bearing potential and testing may be 
performed on urine or serum.  If a positive urine pregnancy test is obtained, a confirmatory 
serum pregnancy test should be conducted.  If confirmatory test is pos itive, subject must 
terminate tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598720].  
Female subjects enrolled in AIM -HN must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 
72 hours prior to start of study  medication (Cycle 1 Day 1).  Pregnancy assessments will be 
performed on Day [ADDRESS_792158] is incl uded into the 
study (date of first signature [CONTACT_598866] -HN informed consent) and continues through the study’s 
post-treatment follow -up period, defined as approximately [ADDRESS_792159].  
The Investigator is required to grade the severity/intensity of each AE. Investigators will 
reference the NCI -CTCAE v 5.0. This is a descriptive terminology that can be used for AE 
reporting. A general grading (severity/intensity) scale is provided at the beginning of the 
referenced document, and specific event grades are also provided. If a particular AE’s 
severity/intensit y is not specifically graded by [CONTACT_43970], the Investigator is to 
revert to the general definitions of Grade [ADDRESS_792160] medical 
judgment.  
The 5 general grades are:  
• Grade 1: Mild

• Grade 5: Death related to AE. Note: Death (Grade 5 as defined by [CONTACT_12134] -CTCAE version 
5.0) is mainly regarded as an outcome, to be documented as described below.  
According to the Sponsor’s convention, if a severity/inten sity of Grade [ADDRESS_792161] also report the event as a n SAE as per Section  11.4.2 . However, a 
laboratory abnormality with a severity/intensity of Grade 4, such as low white blood cell count or 
increased ALT, is considered serious only if the condition meets one of the serious criteria 
described below.  
In the case of death, the primary cause of death (the event leading to death) should be recorded  
and reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be recorded as the outcome of this respective event; death  
will not be recorded as separate event. Only if no cause of death can be reported (e.g., sudden  
death, unexplained death), the death per se might be reported as an SAE.  
Investigators must also systema tically assess the causal relationship of AEs to the IP. Decisive 
factors for the assessment of causal  relationship of an AE to the study  treatments include, but 
may not be limited to, temporal  relationship between the AE and the study  treatments, known 
side effects of the study  treatments,  medical history, concomitant medications and procedures, 
course of the underlying disease  and study  procedures.  
11.3.[ADDRESS_792162] 
immediately (i.e. within a maximum of 24 HOURS after becoming aware of the event) inform 
the person(s) identified in the Serious Adverse Event Report Form by [CONTACT_756] , by [CONTACT_598846]. When an event (or follow -up information) is reported by [CONTACT_756], a written report must 
be sent immediately thereafter by [CONTACT_3719] e -mail. Reporting procedures and timelines are the same 
for any new information on a previously reported  SAE. For names, addresses, telephone and fax 
numbers for SAE reporting, see information included in the Serious Adverse Event Report Form. 
All written reports should be transmitted using the Serious Adverse Event Report Form, which 
must be completed by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator following specific completion instructions.  
The AE section of the eCRF must be completed and a copy of the information transmitted with 
the Serious Adverse Event Report Form. Other relevant pages from the eCRF may also be 
provided (e.g. medi cal history, concomitant drugs). The Investigator/Reporter must respond to 
any request for follow -up information (e.g. additional information, outcome and final evaluation, 
specific records where needed) or to any question the Sponsor may have on the SAE w ithin the 
same timelines as described for initial reports. This is necessary to permit a prompt assessment of 
the event by [CONTACT_598847].  

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_792163] comply with any applicable site -specific 
requirements related to the reporting of SAEs (and in particular deaths) involving his/her 
subjects to the IRB/IEC that approved the study.  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of “findings 
that could adversely affe ct the safety of subjects, impact the conduct of the study or alter the 
IRB/IEC’s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_43932].” In particular and in line with 
respective regulations, the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of AEs that are both seriou s and 
unexpected and are considered to be related to the administered product (“suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions”, S[LOCATION_003]Rs). The Sponsor will also provide S[LOCATION_003]R information to the 
Competent Authorities in all Member States concerned and Ethics  Committees in compliance 
with S[LOCATION_003]R reporting outlined in the European Directive 2001/20/EC.  The Investigator should 
place copi[INVESTIGATOR_598792]. National regulations with regards to 
safety reporting notifications to inve stigators will be taken into account. When specifically 
required by [CONTACT_43973], the Sponsor will provide appropriate safety reports 
directly to the concerned lead IRB/IEC and to the Competent Authorities in all Member States 
concerned and w ill maintain records of these notifications. When direct reporting by [CONTACT_598848] -specific regulations, the Investigator will be responsible 
for promptly notifying the concerned  IRB/IEC of any safety reports provi ded by [CONTACT_598849][INVESTIGATOR_43934].  
11.[ADDRESS_792164] a causal relationship  
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an  
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use  of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  In cases of 
surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is  considered 
as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  In case of a fat ality, the cause of death is considered as 
the AE, and the death is considered as its  outcome.  
Relatedness of an AE will be evaluated as follows:  
• Not related: Not suspected to be reasonably related to the IPs. AE could not medically  
(pharmacologically/clin ically) be attributed to the IPs under study  in this clinical  study  
protocol. A reasonable alternative explanation must be available.  

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-007          Page 81  
 
 
Amendment 3, 9 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL   • Related: Suspected to be reasonably related to the IPs. AE could medically  
(pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to  the IPs under study  in this clinical  study  
protocol.  
11.4.[ADDRESS_792165] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in this definition refers to an event 
in which the subject is at  risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might cause  death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• Results in  persisten t or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is otherwise considered as medically important.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598793] w hen, based upon appropriate medical judgment,  
they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of  
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm  
requiring intensiv e treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  
that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug  
abuse.  
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agen t via an IP is also 
considered a serious adverse reaction and all such cases should be reported in an expedited  
manner.  
11.4.3  Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of an SAE  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43930], or to simplify study  treatment or study  procedures (e.g. 
an overnight stay to facilitate chemotherapy and related hydration therapy application) are not  
considered as SAEs. However, all events leading to unplanned h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_598794] (e.g. undesirable effects of any administered  
treatment) must be documented and reported as SAEs.  
11.4.4  Events Not to Be Considered as AEs/SAEs  
Medical conditions present at the initial study visit that do not worsen in severity or frequency  
during the study  are defined as Baseline Medical Conditions and are NOT to be considered AEs.  
Progression of underlying disease is not an AE and therefore not an SAE per se, rather an  
efficacy endpoint , unless deemed to be causally related to administration of IP. However, if

recorded as AEs and reported as SAEs if meeting any seriousness criteria.  
11.4.5  Abnor mal Laboratory Findings and Other Abnormal Investigational 
Findings  
Abnormal laboratory findings and other abnormal investigational findings (e.g. on an ECG trace) 
should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, l ead 
to treatment discontinuation,  or are considered otherwise medically important by [CONTACT_3786]. If an abnormality fulfills these criteria, the identified medical condition (e.g. low 
white blood cell count, increased ALT) must be reported as the AE r ather than the abnormal 
value itself.

12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. Specific  details 
of the primary and key secondary analyses  will be provided in the Statistical Analysis  Plan 
(SAP). The modified  Intent -to-Treat analysis will be the primary analysis set for efficacy 
analyses and the per-protocol analysis set will be used as the secondary population.  
12.1 Statistical Methods  
12.1.1  Efficacy  
For the AIM -HN analyses, t he estimate of the ORR will be calcu lated based on the maximum 
likelihood estimator (i.e., crude proportion of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598795] ( CR) or Partial Response (PR)  by [CONTACT_223228] ) using the mITT analysis 
population set . Confirmation of response is required.  The estimate of the objective response rate  
will be accompanied by 2 -sided 95% exact binomial confidence interval.  Efficacy will also be 
evaluated among the planned 80 subjects in the per -protocol analysis set , as well as summarized 
based on Investigator assessment of tumor response.  
 
 
 
 
Time to objective response (OR) and  duration of objective response  (DOR)  will be calculated for 
tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598796].  For such subjects, the time to OR is defined as 

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-007          Page 83  
 
 
Amendment 3, 9 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL   number of days from enrollment in AIM -HN until start of PR or CR (whichever occurs first), 
while duration of objective response is def ined as the number of days from the start date of PR or 
CR (whichever response is achieve d first) to the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented. Disease pr ogression will be determined by [CONTACT_598850] v1.1 but local 
treatmen t decisions will be made by [CONTACT_598851] . The duratio n of objective response will be right -censored for subjects 
who achieve CR or PR and meet one of the following conditions: 1)  non-protocol anticancer 
treatment started before documenta tion of disease progression, 2) death or documented disease 
progression after more than 1 m issed disease assessment visit, or 3) alive and does not have 
documentation of disease pro gression before a data an alysis cutoff date. The analyses will be 
performed as determined by [CONTACT_598852] v1.1. Additional supportive analyses will be 
conducted using the investigator assessment.  
The time to OR and DOR  will be summarized descr iptively using the Kaplan -Meier method. The 
50th percentile of the Kaplan -Meier distributi on will be used to estimate the median response 
duration  and a 95% confidence interval for the median response duration will be computed . 
Progression -free survival (P FS) will be defined as the time (in months) from enrollment into 
AIM -HN to either first observation of progressive disease or occurrence of death due to any 
cause within 126 days (approximately 2 time intervals for tumor assessments) of either first 
admini stration of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598797]. In subjects without a progression date 
or with a death date more than [ADDRESS_792167]. Progression -free survival 
analyses should consider tumor assessments after treatment discontinuation or metastatic 
surgery. Survival will be defined as the time  (in months) from enrollment to the occurrence of 
death due to any cause. Sensitivity analyses for PFS and survival will be performed according to 
the FDA Guidance for Industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and 
Biologics (May 20 07). 
Survival and PFS endpoints will be summarized descr iptively using the Kaplan -Meier method. 
The 50th percentile of the Kaplan -Meier distributi on will be used to estimate the median PFS 
and overall survival  and 95% confidence intervals for the median re sponse duration will be 
computed.  
 

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_792168] deviation, median, 25th percentile (first quartile), 75th percentile (third 
quartile), minimum, and maximu m will be presented. For discrete data, the frequency and

14.2.1  Clinic Visits  
• If patients cannot travel to the stud y site or the investigator  cannot accommodate a visit, but 
can still receive care via a local provider, efforts should be made to collect data from the 
local provider in accordance with local privacy/data protection requirements.  Data collected 
may includ e but is not limited to collection of weight and vital signs (heart rate, blood 
pressure, temperature) .  If possible, the investigator should prospectively request that data be 
collected according to good documentation practices (i.e., ALCOA+).  
• Where appli cable, patient visits may be conducted virtually via telephone or video 
conference.  Data collected during calls may include, but is not limited to adverse event 
assessment, concomitant medication assessment, ECOG assessments, survival follow -up, and 
IP co mpliance assessment.  Investigators should ensure:

o Both the investigator and trial participant confirm their respective identities with 
one another before starting a real -time video conference visit  (e.g. have the trial 
participant confirm their date of birth or, if the visit is conducted via 
videoconference, present a form of government issued photographic 
identification)   Consult with the Sponsor or designee to confirm the specifics of 
any process implemented.  
o Details about the date and ti me of the real -time video conference visit, the 
location of the trial subject, the location of the investigator or staff conducting the 
visit should be  appropriately  documented.

• Clinical laboratory testing may be completed by a certified (e.g., CAP) local provider and 
reviewed by [CONTACT_093].  Laboratory results should be reviewed prior to either 
administration or additional shippi[INVESTIGATOR_598800].  
• If a local clinical laboratory wil l collect samples that require use of study specific laboratory 
kits ( , buccal swabs), laboratory kits may be shipped to the study subject to 
take with them to the local laboratory for use during testing.   
• If a local laboratory is utilized , the normal ranges for this lab need to be collected and the 
source of these values (i.e. coming from a local laboratory) needs to be clearly documented

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_792184] (IP) Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  
• If site visit restrictions are anticipated but are not yet in effect, additional IP (beyond one 
cycle) may be dispensed during on -site patient visits  at the Investigator’s discretion .   
• If site visit restrictions are implemented between patient visits, IP may be shipped directly 
from sites to patients under the investigator’ s supervision via overnight courier along with 
instructions for dosing and documentation of dosing.  Delivery signature [CONTACT_598867].  IP should be shipped at ambient temperature using an 
insulated package/container.  Appropriate safeguards should be used to ensure appropriate 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_201188], including  documentation of receipt (signature [CONTACT_372381] ) and condition 
of package (e.g. ensur ing no tamper proof seal had been broken , etc.) 
• The IP may be shipped at ambient temp in credo with no temperature monitoring device . 
• Consult with Sponsor, or designee, as needed to assign IP .   
 
14.5 Managing Restrictions to Site Monitoring by [CONTACT_598861] t ravel limitations, 
implementation of remote  or off -site monitoring visits (OMVs) may be conducted in lieu of on -
site visits whenever possible.  
OMVs should not place an extra burden on trial sites, and subjects must consent to any sharing 
of their personal  information outside the trial site.

according to local guidelines and regulations, but above all to assure the safety of trial 
participants, maintaining compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), and minimizing  risks to 
trial integrity.  Any changes made should be appropriately documented as protocol deviations.  
 
In advance of any interim analyses/planned dat abase locks, the Sponsor will ensure that the 
impact from study visit changes a re assessed and will revise the SAP accordingly.

Protocol Summary 
Title of Study:  The Vivaer® Procedure for Treatment of Nasal Airway Obstruction -   
A Prospec Tive, Multicenter R andomized Controlled Tri Al Comparing 
Vivaer to Sham Control (VATRAC)  
Purpose:  The purpose of this study is to compare the Vivaer procedure for 
treatment of nasal airway obstruction (NAO) with a sham procedure that 
simulates the actual procedure as closely as possible absent the delivery 
of radiofrequency (RF) energy to the nasal tissue.  
Study Device:  Vivaer® ARC Stylus  
  
Indications for 
Use (U.S.):   The Viv aer ARC Stylus is indicated for use in otorhinolaryngology 
(ENT) surgery for the coagulation of soft tissue in the nasal airway, to treat nasal airway obstruction by [CONTACT_443364], including cartilage in the internal nasal valve area.  
The Aerin C onsole is an electrosurgical system intended to generate 
radiofrequency (RF) electrical current for the use of an Aerin Medical Stylus. The Aerin Console is indicated for use in small clinic, office or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143078]. 
Intended and 
Indications for Use (European 
Union) : The Vivaer ARC Stylus is intended to improve nasal breathing by 
[CONTACT_841769].  It is indicated for use in 
patients who experience poor nasal breathing or chronic nasal obstruction. 
The Aerin Console is an electrosurgical system intended to generate radiofrequency (RF) electrical current for modification of soft tissues during ear, nose and throat procedures, when used with an Aerin Medical Stylus.  It is indicated for use in delivering radio -frequency 
energy to tissues as part of ear, nose and throat procedures in small clinic, office or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143078].  
Study 
Objective:  The primary objective is to assess the performance of the Vivaer 
procedure compared to a sham procedure with respect to individual 
participant success rates when used as a treatment for nasal airway 
obstruction. 
Individual participant success (“responder”) is defined as at least 1 
Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale class 
improvement or an improveme nt (decrease) in NOSE Scale score of 
20% or more from baseline at the 3 -month evaluation.

Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page 7 of 62 CONFIDENTIAL  
Study Design:  The study is designed as a multicenter (up to 20 sites), prospective, 
randomized, controlled superiority trial with a one -way crossover 
component avail able to participants randomized to the control arm.  A 
2:1 site -stratified randomization will be used to allocate participants  
with NAO to either the active treatment arm (Vivaer procedure) or the 
control arm (sham procedure) to provide up to 120 total part icipants in 
the following groups: 
o 80 active treatment (Vivaer procedure)  
o 40 inactive treatment (sham procedure)  
All participants will be evaluated in -office  prior to treatment and 
following treatment at week 4 (1 month)  and week 13 (3 months). The 
3-month evaluation will be used for the primary endpoint analysis. 
Active treatment participants (Vivaer procedure) will have an extended follow -up with evaluations conducted in -office at 6 months  (26 week s) 
and remotely at 12 months (52 weeks) and 24 months (104 weeks).  
Participants receiving the sham procedure may elect to crossover to the active treatment arm (Vivaer procedure) within [ADDRESS_1169645] to crossover or no longer  
meet all eligibility criteria will be exited from the study following the 3-
month evaluation. 
Active  
Treatment  
Arm  
(Vivaer procedure) : The Vivaer procedure will be performed in the study clinic using the 
Vivaer ARC Stylus and Aerin Console. The Vivaer A RC Stylus is a 
disposable handheld device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency 
energy to tissue when connected to the Aerin Console radiofrequency 
generating device. Participants in this study will undergo bilateral 
treatment of the nasal valves in  a single study session. Each side of the 
nose will be treated with up to four (4) non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_841753]. The default treatment settings will be used for the 
study: temperature 60 ° C, power 4 watts, treatment time 18 seconds, and 
cooling time 12 seconds. No repeat (“touch up”) procedures will be 
permitted after the initial procedure through the end of the study (24 
months). 
Control Arm  
(Sham 
procedure) : The sham  procedure  will be performed in the study clinic using the 
Vivaer ARC Stylus while audible sounds that accurately simulate the 
Aerin Console’s active treatment are produced even though RF energy 
is not being generated or delivered. All other aspects of the procedure 
will be the same as used for the active treatment, including 
administration of anesthetic agent(s).

Primary Study 
Hypothesis:  The proportion of participants in the active treatment arm (Vivaer 
procedure) with a successful outcome (responders) will exceed the 
proportion of participants in the control arm (sham procedure) with a 
successful outcome (responders) at 3 months postprocedure. 
Primary 
Endpoint:  The primary endpoint is the responder rate at 3 months after  the 
procedure for the randomized participants.  
Secondary 
Endpoints:  • Mean change in NOSE Scale scores from baseline to 3 months after 
procedure. 
• Frequency of device -related and procedure -related serious adverse 
events through the 3-month evaluation. 
Other 
Effectiveness and Safety Measures:  Adverse events  - Incidence (type and category) of adverse events overall 
and by [CONTACT_6492]- up interval.  
Nasal Assessment  - Th e target nasal valve area within each nostril will 
be visually assessed at baseli ne, just prior to treatment (if screening and 
procedure occur on different days), immediately after treatment , at 1 
month, 3 months, and 6 months after the procedure. The use of an 
endoscope for visual assessment is required. Representative video of 
each nasal passage will be captured for each assessment.  
NOSE Scale score:   
• Mean and mean change from baseline at the 3 -, 6-, 12-, and 24-
month follow -up evaluations. 
• Distribution of NOSE Scale score severity categories (mild, 
moderate, severe, extreme) at the 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24 -month 
follow -up evaluations. 
• Mean, change from baseline in mean, and response distribution of the 5 components of the NOSE Scale score (nasal congestion, 
nasal blockage, trouble breathing, trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and getting 
enough air during exercise) at the 3- , 6-, 12- , and 24-month 
follow -up evaluations. 
• Proportion of responders based on improvement in NOSE Scale 
score at the 3 -, 6-, 12-, and 24- month follow- up evaluations.  
Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain  - perception of pain associated with 
the procedure on a [ADDRESS_1169646] pain imaginable assessed immediately after 
treatment, and at 1- month and 3-month follow-up evaluations. 
Visual analog scale (VAS) for ease of breathing  - perception of the 
ability to breathe through the nose on a 0 to 100 mm scale with 0 
indicating no difficulty and 100 indicating extreme difficulty assessed at baseline, 1-month, 3-month, and 6- month follow -up evaluations.

 Page 9 of 62 CONFIDENTIAL  
Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS)  - mean and change from baseline in the 
ESS score at each evaluation. The ESS evaluates the self -reported 
likelihood of dozing or falling asleep in 8 daytime situations w ith 
likelihood rated No Chance  (0), Slight (1), Moderate (2), or High 
Chance (3) administered at baseline and the 1 -, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24 -
month follow -up evaluations. 
Participant Satisfaction Assessment  - Five question self -reported survey 
of satisfaction with the procedure and recommendation to others 
administered at the 3 -, 6-, 12-, and 24- month follow -up evaluations. 
Change in amount of “as needed” (PRN) medication/device use for 
nasal obstruction symptoms  - Self-reported assessment of an increase, 
no ch ange, or decrease in as needed medications and/or devices being 
used for treatment of nasal symptoms at each evaluation compared to 
use prior to the procedure administered at the [ADDRESS_1169647] obstruction symptoms will be documented at baseline and 
updated as necessary at each evaluation.  In addition, medications 
associated with treatment of adverse events will be documented.  
Duration of 
Study:  The primary endpoint will be evaluated at [ADDRESS_1169648] to crossover and receive the active Vivaer procedure within 
30 days after the 3- month evaluation with continued follow -up for 24 
more months for a total of 28 months of follow -up. Study enrollment is

 Page [ADDRESS_1169650] obstruction (NAO) is a highly prevalent disorder that affects the upper 
airway system causing restriction in normal airflow into the nasal cavity. Chronic 
nasal obstructi on can elicit many symptoms, including congestion, stuffiness, 
headache, fatigue, sleep disturbance, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], snoring and impairment of various daily and social activities leading to an overall decline in health -related 
quality of life (Q oL).
1-3 Given its high prevalence, treatment of NAO can be costly, 
with  expenditures for prescriptions, over -the- counter medications, and doctor’s 
visits.  
NAO  can be mediated  by a diversity of mucosal and structural disorders in the nasal 
cavity , including acute or chronic mucosal inflammation from infection, allergenic or 
non-allergenic irritants, or structural factors such as nasal masses or polyps, turbinate 
hypertrophy, na sal septal deviation, and nasal valve angle changes, narrowing or 
collapse.1,4-[ADDRESS_1169651].
3,8-10 As described by [CONTACT_535418]’s law, minute changes in the diameter of a 
tube will result in exponential changes in airflow11. 
Multiple devices designed to increase the size of the nasal passage at the nasal valve area are available over -the- counter (OTC) for noninvasive management of NAO.  
These products are marketed to people with poor nasal breathing, snoring difficulties, and those with increased breathing demands, such as athletes. These devices include 
adhesive external nasal dilator strips and internal nasal dilators. Both internal and 
external dilators have been found to effectively dilate the nasal airway and reduce airwa y resistance.
12-[ADDRESS_1169652] commonly consists of repair of a deviated nasal septum and reduction of the inferior turbinates. Surgi cal treatments may involve various suturing 
techniques used alone or in conjunction with grafting techniques using autologous 
cartilage typi[INVESTIGATOR_841755].
8, 
16-19 A new minimally invasive surgical procedure has also been introduced that uses 
an absorbable poly mer blend nasal implant to support the upper and lower cartilage 
inside the lat eral nasal wall similar to more traditional cartilage and nonabsorbable 
polymer grafts.20 Surgical treatments  are efficacious, but may require  significant 
recovery periods with complication  risks  such as bleeding, intranasal adhesions, 
scarring, infection, and graft migration, resorption or extrusion .16,19-23  
Radiofrequency (RF)  energy has been used for decades in the fields of 
otorhinolaryngology (ENT), neurosurgery, cardiology, urology and general surgery. 
  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page [ADDRESS_1169653] demonstrated that radiofrequency therapy applied to tissue of the nasal passage can be safe and effective in improving nasal obstruction while preserving nasal function.
27 Radiofrequency turbinate reduction (RFTR), for instance, is a 
minimally invasive surgical option that can reduce tissue volume in a precise, targeted manner.  This technique uses radiofrequency to create heat within the 
submucosal tissue of the turbinate, reducing tissue volume with minimal impact on surrounding tissues. Radiofrequency turbinate reduction differs fundamentally from traditional surgical methods by [CONTACT_138532] -power radiofrequency energy to provide a 
relatively quick and painless treatment for tissue coagulation and/or ablation .
[ADDRESS_1169654] been multiple studies analyzing the safety and outcomes of RFTR treatment. A systematic literature review of the RF ablation technique concluded that the technique is well tolerated and effective.
29  
Targeted radiofrequency heating of the later al cartilaginous nasal wall has also been 
used in patients with inspi[INVESTIGATOR_138506]; however, an incisional approach was required.
30 In this investigation, 3 treatments were applied per side with 
intent to produce tissue retraction and volume reduction. Participants (n=28) were 
asked to evaluate their nasal blockage on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating total blockage and 0, no sensation of blockage. At 16 weeks the mean VAS for the left nostril had decreased from 8.2 to 3. 4 and decreased for the 
right nostril from 8.9 to 4.1. There were no major complications during or after the procedure. 
The Vivaer procedure has previously been investigated in a prospective, 
nonrandomized multicenter study with 50 participants that supported regulatory 
clearance of the Viv aer ARC Stylus.
31 Participants exhibited significant symptoms of 
nasal obstruction attributed to internal nasal valve dysfunction  with Nasal Obstruction 
Symptom E valuation (NOSE) S cale score ≥[ADDRESS_1169655] events occurred in the period from the procedure to 4 weeks. Soreness, edema, and crusting resolved by  
4 weeks . The mean baseline NOSE S cale score was 79.9 (SD 10.8, range 60-100), 
and all participants had severe or extreme nasal obstruction. At 6 months , mean 
NOSE Scale score improved to 24.7 (SD 20.4, range 0- 90) with an average decrease 
  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page 16 of 62  CONFIDENTIAL  
of 54.5 (68.6%). The s evere and extreme nasal obstruction categories were reduced to 
10%. At 12 weeks, all participants (100%) were treatment responders, defined as 
participant s with at least a 15 -point decrease in the NOSE S cale score, and at 6 
months there were 3 nonresponders for a 94% responder rate. The decrease in NOSE 
Scale score did not differ significantly between patients who did or did not have prior 
nasal surgery.  
Thirty -nine of this study’s participants enrolled in a long -term follow -up study to 
assess NOSE score and quality of life through 2 years  with evaluations at 12, 18, and 
24 months.  The mean NOSE S cale score at baseline was 80.8 (SD 10.7) for 
participants in the follow -up study. The mean NOSE Scale score for participant s in 
this study improved t o 24.9 (SD 21.3) at the 26 -week endpoint of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_841756] a mean change from baseline of 55.9 (SD 23.6). Improvement in mean NOSE 
Scale score was maintained through the 12 -, 18-, and 24- month evaluations (27.5, 
32.7, and 26.5, respectively). At 6 months , severe and extreme nasal obstruction rates 
had decreased from 100% to 10% (4 of 39) of participants , and at 12- , 18- , and 24-
months, 17%, 26% and 17% of participant s had severe or extreme nasal obstruction, 
respectively.  Using the definition of res ponder of at least a 15- point improvement in 
NOSE Scale score, 92% of participants in this study were classified as responders at 6 
months and at 12 months 94% were classified as responders (3 participants  were not 
evaluated at 12 months). All 39 participa nts were evaluated at 18 months with a 
responder rate of 87% and at 24 months , 36 of 39 participants were evaluated and had 
a responder rate of 97%. Participants in the study also responded favorably to the 
Aerin Medical Quality of Life survey showing improvement in areas such as sleep quality, energy and productivity, wellbeing and emotions, less sickness, and less frequent use of medication compared to prior to having the procedure. Treatment for 
symptoms of nasal obstruction attributed to internal nasal valve dysfunction with the Vivaer procedure was demonstrated to provide durable relief through [ADDRESS_1169656] obstruction with a sham procedure that simulates the actual procedure as 
closely as possible absent the delivery of radiofrequency energy to the nasal tissue.  
2.1 Device and Regulatory Status 
The Vivaer procedure will be performed in the study clinic  using the Vivaer ARC 
Stylus and Aerin Console . The Vivaer ARC Stylus is a disposable handheld device 
capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue when connected to the Aerin Console radiofrequency generating device.  
The Vivaer ARC Stylus was cleared for use in the [LOCATION_002]  (U.S.) by [CONTACT_86959] ( FDA) under 510(k) K172529 and the Aerin Console was 
cleared under 510(k) K162810. Both devices  are also CE -marked  in the European 
Union.

Individual participant success ( “responder” ) is defined as at least 1 Nasal 
Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) S cale class improvement or an 
improvement (decrease) in NOSE S cale score of 20% or more from baseline at the 
3-month evaluation.   
The primary obje ctive will be assessed through evaluation of the primary endpoint 
defined as the responder  rate at 3 months after the procedure  for the randomized 
participants . 
3.2 Secondary Objectives  
Additional objectives include assessment and comparison of secondary and 
informational outcome measures between the groups receiving the Vivaer 
procedure and the sham  procedure. 
Secondary endpoints are: 
• Mean change in NOSE Scale scores from baseline to 3 months after procedure. 
• Frequency of device -related and procedure -related serious adverse events 
through the 3- month evaluation.  
Other Effectiveness and Safety Measures include: 
• A

and by [CONTACT_6492]- up interval.  
• Nasal Assessment  - The target nasal valve  area within each nostril will be 
visually assessed at baseline, just prior to procedure  (if screening and 
procedure occur on dif ferent days ), immediately after procedure, at [ADDRESS_1169659] 
holding breath and during maximal inhalation to capture dynamic changes. 
• NOSE Scale score:   
o Mean and mean change from baseline at the 3 -, 6-, 12-, and 24-
month follow -up evaluations. 
o Distribution of NOSE Scale score severity categories ( mild, 
moderate, severe, extreme ) at the 3- , 6-, 12-, and 24- month follow -
up evaluations. 
o Mean, change from baseline in mean, and response distribution of the 5 components of the NOSE Scale score (nasal congestion, nasal blockage, trouble breathing, trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and getting enough air during exercise) at the 3- , 6-, 12-, and 24- month follow -

4.0 Study Plan  
4.1 Study Design 
The study is designed as a m ulticenter ( up to 20 sites in the  U.S. and Europe ), 
prospective , randomized, controlled superiority trial  with a one -way crossover 
component available to participants randomized to the control arm . A 2:1 site-
stratified randomization will be used to allocate participant s with NAO to either the 
active treatment arm ( Vivaer procedure) or the control arm ( sham procedure ) to 
provide up to 120 total participants in the following groups: 
  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page 20 of 62  CONFIDENTIAL  
o 80 active treatment (Viv aer procedure) 
o 40 inactive treatment  (sham procedure) 
All participants will be evaluated in -office prior to treatment and following 
treatment at week 4 (1 month)  and week 13 (3 months ). The 3- month evaluation 
will be used for the primary endpoint analysis.   
Active treatment participants (Vivaer procedure) will have an extended follow -up 
with evaluations conducted in -office at 6 months  (26 weeks)  and remotely at 12 
months (52 weeks) and 24 months (104 weeks). 
Participants receiving the sh am procedure may elect to crossover to the active 
treatment arm (Vivaer procedure) within [ADDRESS_1169662] obstruction primarily due to internal nasal v alve dysfunction, rather 
than hypertrophied turbinates. This study requires severe or extreme symptoms demonstrated by a NOSE S cale score ≥
 [ADDRESS_1169663] had previous surgical treatment of the nasal valve are not eligible to enroll in this study; however, it is  anticipated that many patients will have 
already undergone rhinoplasty, septoplasty, inferior turbinate reduction or other surgical procedures prior to being approached for participation in this study. Therefore, a history of those types of procedures doe s not exclude a patient from 
enrolling in this study. However, to ensure that changes in NOSE Scale score over 
the course of follow -up are the result of the Vivaer procedure, prior surgical 
procedures must have been performed at least [ADDRESS_1169664] meet all  inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below for participation 
in the study. 
4.2.1 In clusi on Criteria  
1. Age 18 to 85 years (inclusively). 
2. Willing and able to provide informed consent.  
3. Willing and able to comply with the subject- specific requirements outlined

• Use of exter nal nasal dilator strips (eg, Breathe Right Strips)  
• Use of internal nasal dilator cones  
• Modified Cottle Maneuver (manual elevation of the lateral nasal wall using a small instrument or cotton -tipped applicator to open 
the nasal valve) 
• Cottle Maneuver (manual lateral retraction of the cheek to open the nasal valve)  
7. Dissatisfaction with medical management as judged by [CONTACT_102].

 Page [ADDRESS_1169665] provide written informed 
consent before undergoing any study related procedures. A participant will be  
considered enrolled after signing and dating the IRB/EC approved informed consent form. If a participant is enrolled in the study but subsequently does not meet the eligibility criteria, participation in the study will be terminated and the data may be excluded from all analysis.  
Randomization will occur after the participant is enrolled, met all eligibility criteria, 
and prior to the treatment procedure allowing sufficient time to prepare the required 
treatment. The randomized assignment (active treatment arm or control arm) will be 
determined using a web- based service. Once the baseline assessments have been 
completed  and if patient meets eligibility, results must be entered into the electronic 
data capture (EDC)  system before the system will randomize the participant to a 
study assignment group. Participants  will be assigned to the active treatment arm 
(Vivaer procedure ) or the control arm (s ham procedure) in a 2:[ADDRESS_1169666] adherence to the randomization process.  
4.4 Blinding  
It will not be possible to blind the investigator administering the treatment because of obvious differences in the active application of the RF energy versus the sham 
control. However, every effort should be made to keep the participant blinded as to 
the treatment received.   Steps to help maintain blinding include: 
• Following the same preparation procedures for all cases, including administration of anesthetics (topi[INVESTIGATOR_836760]). 
• Application of the Vivaer ARC Stylus in the same manner (pressure, locations, 
timing) for both the active and sham procedures. 
• Simulation of RF energy being applied by [CONTACT_841770]. 
• Use of a blinded evaluator  (nontreating physician) to conduct  the follow- up visit  
nasal assessment  when feasible ; however, this is not required. Medical 
personnel who are unaware of the treatment received are also preferred for  
overseeing and coordinating the collection of the participant reported outcome measures during the follow- up evaluations. At a minimum, the treating 
physician should not be present w hen the participant reported outcomes are 
being collected. Site training will include the importance of maintaining the

Assessments include:  
• Saddle nose deformity  
• Bruising around orbital a rea 
• Soreness, pain 
• Numbness 
  Endoscope required: 
• Inflammation / generalized redness  
• Swelling, edema  
• Blanching (generalized whiteness)  
• Bleeding at anesthetic injection site (not requiring physician 
intervention) 
• Bleeding at treatment site (not requiring physician intervention)

• Disruption of mucosal flow / crusting  
4.5.2 Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale  
Evaluation of nasal valve obstruction is based on clinical observations of signs 
and symptoms with no easily obtained, reproducible objective measurement techniques of the valve.
3 Poor correlation and uncertainty between more 
objective measures of nasal patency  (eg, nasal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_138507], acoustic 
rhinometry, rhinomanometry, CT scans, physician assessment of anatomy)  
and subjective measures have generally been reported.32-[ADDRESS_1169668] 
important determinates of treatment outcome .3,32,33 
To evaluate the significance of a patient’s nasal obstruction both before and 
after the procedure, this study will use the well -known subjective patient -
  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page 24 of 62  CONFIDENTIAL  
reported Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale for 
determinin g the primary endpoint of the study. The NOSE S cale is a validated 
disease -specific health status instrument used by [CONTACT_841771] s treated for nasal obstruction.37 The NOSE S cale consists 
of 5 items, each scored using a 5- point Likert scale to make a total score range 
of 0 through 100, where higher scores indicate worse obstruction. Severity of 
symptoms can be classified as mild (range, 5 -25), moderate (range, 30 -50), 
severe (range, 55 -75), or extreme (range, 80- 100) nasal obstruction, based on 
responses to the NOSE survey.38 
Treatment r esponder based on NOSE Scale improvement  
Individual participant success (responder) is defined as at least 1 Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale class improvement, (eg, 
going from a score in the severe range (55 -75) at baseline to a score in the 
moderate range (30- 50) at the 3- month evaluation ), or an improvement 
(decrease) in NOSE Scale score of 20% or more from baseline at the 3 -month 
evaluation. 
4.5.3 Pa in – Visual Analog Sc ale Pain Score  
A horizontal 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS)39 anchored on the left with 
the words “No Pain ” and on the right with the words “ Worst Pain 
Imaginable ”, will be used to measure nasal pain associated with the 
procedure. Scores are obtained by [CONTACT_841772] (0) to the point indicated with a vertical slash placed 
by [CONTACT_841773].   
4.5.4 Ease of Breath ing – Visual Analog Scale Breathing Score 
A horizontal 100 mm VAS  anchored on the left with the words “No Difficulty 
Breathing ” and on the right with the words “Extreme Difficulty  Breathing ”, 
will be used  to assess the perception of the ability to breathe through the nose .  
Scores are obtained by [CONTACT_841774] (0) to the point indicated with a vertical slash placed by [CONTACT_841775] . 
4.5.5 Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS)  
The ESS evaluates the self -reported likelihood of dozing or falling asleep in 8 
daytime situations with likelihood rated No Chance  (0), Slight (1), Moderate 
(2), or High Chance (3).
40 The total of the scores across the 8 questions can be 
categorized and interpreted as:  
• 0-7  It is unlikely that you are abnormally sleepy.  
• 8-[ADDRESS_1169669] an average amount of daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].   
• 10-15 You may be excessively sleepy depending on the situation.

4.5.6 Participa nt Satisfaction Assessment   
Five question self -reported survey of satisfaction using a 5- point scale to 
assess tolerability of the procedure, ease of recovery, breathing through nose, overall satisfaction with the procedure, and recommendation to others. 
4.5.7 Change in amount of PRN medication/device use for nasal obstruction sympto ms  
Self-reported assessment of an increase, no change, or decrease from baseline 
in as needed medications and/or devices being used for treatment of nasal 
symptoms following the procedure. Medication/device use may be 
categorized for reporting purposes.   
4.5.8 Medication  and Other Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_841759] , devices or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_841760] , medication name, frequency, and dose will be recorded at 
each evaluation visit. Medications may  be categorized for reporting purposes. 
4.5.9 Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be documented according to Section 7.1.2. 
4.6 Success/ Failure Criteria  
Determinations of the overall success of  treatment will be based on two levels : (1) 
the individual participant  level and (2) the overall treatment group success relative 
to the sham  control group.  Each level has its own criteria for success.  
4.6.1 Participant  Success 
The primary outcome success measure for a participant  in this study is based 
on an improvement (decrease) in the NOSE Scale score after the procedure compared to the baseline score. The improvement must reflect  at least one 
category improvement or ≥
 20% decrease in score at the 3 -month evaluation 
for the participant to be considered a success (responder).  
4.6.2 Participant  Failure  
A participant will be considered a nonresponder at the 3-month  evaluation if 
neither success criterion has been attained.  
4.6.3 Study Success  
The study will be considered a success if the proportion of participants  in the 
active treatment arm achieving a successful outcome (responder) is 
statistically significantly greater than  the proportion of participants in the 
  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page [ADDRESS_1169671] to crossover and receive the active Viv aer 
procedure within 30 days after the 3- month evaluation  with continued follow -up for 
24 more months for a total of up to 28 months of follow -up. Study e nrollment is 
anticipated to be completed within 12 months. Therefore, total study duration is 
anticipated to be approximately 40 months. 
4.8 Site Staffing and Responsibilities of Study Personnel  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_114083] s/ he has sufficient and 
qualified staff to conduct the clinical study and that all study- related tasks have 
been appropriately delegated and documented. Roles may include:  
• Treating physician – The treating physician  will perform the procedure and 
postprocedure assessments. The treating physician must be a medical doctor 
with experience in ENT procedures and trained in administering the Vivaer 
procedure.   
• Blinded physician evaluator (Not Required) – A physician experienced in 
ENT procedures , trained for participation in this study,  and unaware of the 
treatment received , may be used to conduct the follow -up nasal assessment. 
The blinded evaluator may also be responsible for the assessment , treatment 
and/or management of adverse events; however, in some cas es it may be 
necessary to refer the event to the treating physician . If a blinded evaluator 
is not available, the treating physician or principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_836762] -up assessments.  
• Oversight of participant reported outcomes  and other data  collection – 
Medical or office staff with relevant knowledge and experience as determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_841761] . Ideally, 
these individuals would be unaware of the treatment received by [CONTACT_3038].  
Due to differences between the active and sham control procedure s, staff may also 
become aware of the treatment being administered. Staff with knowledge of the 
randomization assignment should not communicate any information to the 
participant  or blinded evaluator (if used) in order to minimize any potential bias.  
4.9 Device Description  
The Vivaer procedure incorporates use of the Viv aer ARC Stylus (Model FG257), 
which is a cleared and CE -marked (FDA - K172529, CE 639608) disposable 
handheld device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue, and 
  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page 27 of 62  CONFIDENTIAL  
the Aerin Console  (Model  FG226), a cleared and CE -marked (FDA - K162810, CE  
639608) RF generator with temperature control capable of delivering very low 
doses of energy. 
The Vivaer ARC Stylus ( Figure 1 ) consists of a handle, shaft and treatment tip. An 
array of bipolar electrodes is positioned on a nonconductive tip  (Figure 2) that is 
attached to the  handle via a nonconductive shaft. A temperature sensor is located on 
the Stylus tip to monitor tissue temperature  during RF energy delivery. The Stylus 
is powered by a n external temperature -controlled radiofrequency generator  via a 
flexible cable  (Figure 3). The Stylus incorporates features to allow compatibility 
with and authentication by [CONTACT_836773]. The connector for the Viv aer 
ARC Stylus has a pin configuration that prevents its use with other RF generators, 
making it only compatible with the Aerin Console. Authentication of the Stylus is 
achieved via a crypto chip that is built into the Stylus handle assembly. The chip is read and written to by [CONTACT_143120]. Information stored on the chip includes the Stylus model information, treatment parameters, usage timestamp data, and a 
count of the remaining treatment cycles (based upon pre- set maximum).  
The Vivaer ARC Stylus is temporarily inserted into the nose to access the treatment 
area. The Stylus requires the application of conductive media (eg, saline gel) to the 
tip prior to use. The conductive media helps to ensure good contact [CONTACT_841776]. Application of the RF energy is controlled by a foot switch connected to the Aerin Console. T he Vivaer 
ARC Stylus improves nasal breathing by [CONTACT_841777]. The low -power radiofrequency energy 
generates heat within the tissue and creates a coagulation lesion. As the lesion heals, the tissue retracts  and stiffens, thereby [CONTACT_841778].  
The procedure requires local anesthesia only. The Stylus is manufactured and 
supplied sterile and for single use only by [CONTACT_143123].

4.10 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
4.10.1 Risks  
Potential risks associated with the use of the Viv aer ARC Stylus do not differ 
from commonly used devices and treatments for nasal obstruction and 
snoring, but due to the nonsurgical nature of the therapy, small treatment area, low energy delivery, and lack of need for general anesthesia, the overall risk 
to the participant may be less than presented by [CONTACT_841779], septoplasty, or functional rhinoplasty. 

  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page 29 of 62  CONFIDENTIAL  
Potential risks associated with the use of the Vivaer ARC Stylus and the 
associated local anesthetics are listed  below. Participants  will be monitored 
closely as part of this study to allow for early detection of potential problems 
and prompt treatment if required.   
Anticipated adverse events or side effects that may occur as a result of the 
treatment include :  
• Infection  
• Bleeding (other than during the treatment at treatment sites and greater 
than anticipated by [CONTACT_093])  
• Mucosal changes  
• Scar formation leading to nasal obstruction  
• External deformity  
• Sensory changes at treatment site   
• Bruising including around the orbital area (black eyes)  
Anticipated observations that are expected in and around the treatment area 
and are considered minor include:   
• Inflammation / generalized redness  
• Temporary swelling, edema  
• Blanching (generalized whiteness)  
• Temporary numbness/tingling  
• Temporary soreness/pain 
• Mild bleeding at anesthetic injection and/or treatment site (not 
requiring physician- level intervention, such as cautery)  
• Temporary nasal obstruction from tissue edema  
• Disruption of mucosal flow/intranasal crusting  
• Scab format ion 
These observations will be assessed in the nasal assessment and recorded at study visits if they occur. Should any of the following require mitigation by [CONTACT_836776], they will be  considered an adverse event and will be recorded on 
the study Adverse Event Report e CRF.  
Symptomatic improvements may not be achieved in all participants receiving the Vivaer procedure and may not be durable beyond the 3- month evaluation  
in all participants with relief at 3 months.  
  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page 30 of 62  CONFIDENTIAL  
An additional risk to participants receiving the sham procedure is a potential 
for higher likelihood of the treatment not relieving their nasal obs truction 
symptoms compared to those receiving the Viv aer procedure. 
4.10.2 Potential Risks to Participant Confidentiality  
In all clinical studies, confidentiality of protected health information may be breached due to study- related activities beyond those  of routine clinical care. 
This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_841780]’s electronic case report forms (eCRF). Risks to participant confidentiality are further minimized by [CONTACT_841781]. The 21 CRF Part 11 compliant and validated system maintains audit trails on all entries, changes or corrections to eCRFs. If a person with authority to complete but not sign eCRFs makes changes to an already signed eCRF, the investigator will be required to resign the eCRF, thereby [CONTACT_841782].  
4.10.3 Mitigation of Risks  
The study was developed based on previous preclinical and clinical experience and includes a number of steps to minimize any additional risks to participants  in the study: 
• Preclinical mechanical and bench evaluations have been conducted to demonstrate that the design characteristics of the study device are appropriate for reliable clinical use of the device.  
• The Vivaer ARC Stylus and Console have been cleared for use by [CONTACT_841783] -marked in the European Union. 
• The study will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_154630](s)/Ethics Committee and conducted according to applicable 
regulations with ongoing review by [CONTACT_1201]/EC. 
• Careful consideration has been given to the inclu sion/exclusion criteria 
in order to select appropriate candidates for treatment.  
• Patient s will be fully informed of the study requirements prior to 
enrollment.  
• Only physicians with experience in nasal surgical and minimally 
invasive procedures, and with specific training using the Viv aer ARC 
Stylus for performing the Vivaer procedure will be permitted  to 
participate in the study. 
• Study procedures, f ollow -up, and study monitoring are  designed to 
closely manage adverse events in a timely manner.

5.4 Treatment Visit and Procedure  
Randomization will occur after the participant is enrolled, met all eligibility criteria, 
and prior to performing the procedure allowing enough time for preparation of t he 
selected treatment .  
The treatment procedure is summarized below. Consult the Viv aer procedure 
Investigator’s Brochure and the Vivaer ARC Stylus and Aerin Console Instructions 
for Use  (IFUs) for full detail of the treatment procedure  and step -by-step 
instructions for preparation and use of the Viv aer ARC Stylus and Aerin Console. 
Pre paration   
The procedure will be performed in the study clinic.  The participant will be 
positioned in the exam chair according to personal comfor t and study physician’s 
preference (eg , upright, reclined or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). A nasal assessment (physical and 
endoscopic exam)  will be performed on each side of the nose  and for each nostril , 
including video (only required if screening and procedure occur on different days). 
This is to assess the configuration of the structural components of the lateral nasal 
wall (including the upper and lower lateral cartilage, their junction and the overlying mucosa) and to allow the study physician to map out and plan the areas of treatment. Participants will undergo bilateral treatment of the nasal valves in a 
single study procedure session . Each side of the nose will be treated with up to four 
(4) non- overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_841762].  
 
Figure 4.  Vivaer ARC Stylus at the nasal valve  
The study physician will anesthetize the treatment area by [CONTACT_2329] a topi[INVESTIGATOR_841763]/gauze or spray  of lidocaine to numb the mucosal tissue , wait approximately 
[ADDRESS_1169674] anesthesia to the treatment area after  initial numbness 
has occurred. The control group will undergo the same anesthetic protocol as the active treatment group.  

  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page 37 of 62  CONFIDENTIAL  
Treatment Administration  
A nasal speculum is inserted into the nostri l and opened to visualize the treatment 
area on the lateral nasal wall. The Vivaer ARC Stylus will then be inserted to access 
the treatment  area. The S tylus will be connected to the Aerin Console generator and 
the RF energy level will be set on the generat or.    
The default settings for the Vivaer ARC Stylus  will be used for the study:  
Temperature   60° C 
Power    [ADDRESS_1169675] the cartilage and mucosa of the lateral nasal wall and deliver RF energy to the tissues consistent with the  IFU. A tone sounds when the Console is activated, signifying that energy is 
being delivered through the Stylus; this tone stops when the pedal is released and RF energy is no longer delivered. 
When conducting a sham control procedure, the study physician will activate an 
audible tone mimicking the activation of the Aerin Console; however , no energy 
will be transmitted to the Stylus. The study physician should apply the Stylus to the 
lateral nasal wall in a similar fashion as would be done if energy was act ually being 
delivered.  
No repeat ("touch- up") procedures will be permitted during the study follow-up 
period.   
Procedure data collection  
Data relating to the procedure and the products used will be recorded on the Study 
Procedure e CRF .  The following information  will be recorded: 
• Preprocedure nasal assessment (physical and endoscopic exam) for each 
nostril including video (only required if screening and procedure occur on 
different days).  
• Procedure type, date of procedure  
• Preprocedure and procedure medications 
• Vivaer ARC Stylus and Aerin Console information  
• Procedure start and end times 
• Aerin Console settings  
• Treatment duration  
• Number of sites treated

 Page 38 of 62  CONFIDENTIAL  
• Occurrence of device malfunctions, protocol deviations, and/or a dverse 
events 
• Postprocedure nasal assessment (physical and endoscopic exam) for each 
nostril including video 
5.5 Postprocedure Assessments and Care  
Immediately postprocedure, a nasal assessment (physical and endoscopic exam) for each nostril including video will be conducted prior to discharging the participant  
and reported on the Study  Procedure e CRF .   
Participants will be asked to indicate  the pain level experienced during the study 
procedure from anesthesia delivery to procedure completion using the VAS pain score instrument (vertical line marked on the 100 mm line) on the Pain VAS CRF . 
At the discretion of the study physician, the following care may be provided: 
• Apply compression to the treatment area internally for 5 minutes.  
• Apply petroleum jelly to the treatment area as needed.  
• Use of nasal saline spray or ointment as needed  
• The participant  should be instructed not to manipulate the treatment site for 
[ADDRESS_1169676] follow- up visit (4 weeks) scheduled within the 
visit window  prior to release . 
Participants  should not receive other concomitant nasal treatment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_841764] -up period to avoid 
confounding the evaluation of the effect of the treatment , unless the additional care 
is in response to an adverse event or is considered in the best interest of the participant . Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], interventions, and pain medication will be monitored at 
follow -up evaluations.   
5.6 Follow- up Evaluations  and Study Exit  
Follow- up visit dates will be calculated from the study procedure date. Follow -up 
visits should be scheduled within the specified visit windows described in the 
Schedule of Events (Section 5.1) and Table 1 (Section 8.3.2). In-office follow -up 
evaluations are scheduled for 4 weeks (1 month) , 13 weeks (3 months)  and 26 
weeks ( 6 months ) after the procedure. In addition, follow- up evaluations at 12  and 
24 months  after the treatment  procedure  will be conducted remotely as a telephone 
assessment by [CONTACT_8786] . The timing of all follow -up evaluations is based on 
the date of the procedure and should not be altered based on the actual time of preceding follow -up visits. Participants  who make nonstudy visits should be 
evaluated for possible adverse events and an A dverse Event Report e CRF  should be  
submitted if appropriate . 
Participants randomized to the control arm (sham procedure) may elect to crossover to the active treatment arm (Vivaer pro cedure) within 30 days after the 3-month 
  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page [ADDRESS_1169677] undergone their scheduled 3- month evaluation and 
continue to meet all of the eligibility criteria , including NOSE Scale score of ≥ 55. 
New baseline information will be collected prior to the Vivaer procedure. Crossover 
participants who choose to have the Vivaer procedure will maintain  their original 
study ID and will follow the same pretreatment, treatment, and follow -up processes 
as any newly enrolled participant.   
All participants who receive the Viv aer procedure, as well as sham procedure 
participants who choo se to have the Viv aer procedure after their 3- month 
evaluation, should be followed through the final follow -up evaluation  at 2 years  
postprocedure regardless of their  success/failure classification. Sham procedure 
participants who choose not to have the Viv aer procedure or who f ail to meet 
inclusion and exclusion criteria  will be exited from the study following the 3-month 
evaluation. Every effort should be made to avoid having participants  withdraw from 
the study (Section  9.6). If a participant does choose to withdraw from the study, it is 
very important to record information regarding the reason(s) and the last known 
status of the participant . 
The following assessments will be conducted as indicated for each follow -up time 
point and recorded on the Follow-up Visit e CRF:  
In-o ffice evaluations: 4 -Week s (1-month), 13- Week s (3-month) and 26- week s (6-

 Study Exit  
Participants meeting the study requirements as planned will be exited from the 
study upon completion of  the 24 -month follow -up evaluation. If a participant 
reaches the 24 -month follow -up evaluation and is experiencing a new or ongoing 
adverse event, the study sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_138544]/or methods for continued surveillance of the event.

6.[ADDRESS_1169679] obstruction with a sham 
procedure that simulates  the actual procedure as closely as possible absent the 
delivery of radiofrequency (RF) energy to the nasal tissue . A 2:1 site -stratified 
randomization will be used to allocate participants with NAO to either the Vivaer 
procedure (active treatment) or a sham procedure (control). This study is designed 
to demonstrate the superiority of the active Viv aer treatment compared to the sham  
control.  
6.2 Study Hypotheses  
The null hypothesis (H 0) for this superiority study is that there is no difference 
between the success (responder) rate for the sham  control and the success 
(responder) rate for the Vivaer procedure: 
H0: πC - π T = 0 vs. H 1: πC - π T ≠ 0 
where:  
  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page 41 of 62  CONFIDENTIAL  
πC=proportion of responders in the sham procedure control group 
πT=proportion responders in the Viv aer procedure treatment group  
Rejection of the two-sided null hypothesis in favor of the alternative (H 1) 
hypothesis means that there is evidence for a statist ically significant difference in 
responder rates between the two groups.   
6.[ADDRESS_1169680]  and on the following assumptions: 
• Significance level α = 0.05 (two- sided)  
• Power = 80% 
• πC = 0.50 (allowance for a 50% control responders ) 
• πT = 0.80 (assumed 80% responde rs in the treated group) 
• Treatment allocation is 2 :1 
• 10% dropout and nonevaluable 
The 80% responder rate assumed for the active Viv aer procedure group is a 
conservative estimate based on the prior clinical study of this procedure in which all 
50 participants were responders at 12 weeks and 46 of 49 (94%) were responders at 26 weeks. The lower 95% confidence bound on the estimate of 94% is 83.5%, which supports the conservative estimate of 80% responders assumed for the purpose of sample size calculation. The 50% responder rate assumed for the sham 
control procedure is based on literature for placebo and sham controls in therapeutic and device studies suggesting from 30% to 60% responder rates, with device studies tending to be at the higher end of the range
42. A randomized study of a 
bioabsorbable implant treatment for nasal valve collapse reported a 54.7% responder rate in the sham procedure arm of the study.
20  
The minimum number of participants  to achieve 80% power with a 2:1 active 
treatment to sham  control allocation is 66 in the active treatment group and 33 in 
the sham . The sample size, allowing for 1 0% loss (nonevaluable) in each group and 
adjusting for a balanced distribution across 20 sites is 120 participants  (80 active 
treatment (Vivaer procedure) , 40 sham procedure control ). 
It is anticipated that participants will be enrolled at sites on a competitive basis; however, a  reasonable balance of partic ipants  among sites may  be maintained by

the primary endpoint at 13- weeks  (3-month) postprocedure. The primary  and 
secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the data from the primary evaluation 
phase for an interim study report when  these data become available. Information al 
outcomes will be analyzed and included in interim reports after all participants have 
reached each of the successive follow -up time points. A  final study report will be 
provided after all participants have reached the final 24-month  (104- week ) follow-
up evaluation of the extended follow -up phase of the study, including sham 
procedure control participants who subsequently received the Vivaer procedure. 
6.5 Analysis Populations  
The primary endpoint analysis will be based on the intent to treat (IT T) princip le.  
Participants  will be analyzed in the originally randomized treatment group 
regardless of actual treatment received. The effects of protocol deviation s will only 
be examined when the validity of the study conclusion is in question. All second ary 
and other analyses and reports will include an ITT population analysis. Following 
data reporting conventions, statistics on the per protocol population will also be 
reported. The per protocol population is defined as all participants who received 
treatments, with 13- week ( 3-month) follow -up data and no major protocol 
deviations. 
6.[ADDRESS_1169682] hoc  
sensitivity analys es may be performed, including a wors t-case analysis ( all missing 
primary outcomes in the Viv aer procedure group are considered nonresponders and 
all missing outcomes in the sham  procedure control group a re responders) and/or  a 
change- point analysis, to assess the effect of missing data on the primary analysis . 
The results of the sensitivity analysis will not be used to adjust the conclusions drawn from the primary analysis . 
Secondary outcome measures and additional observational measurements will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_143136]. 
6.7 Pooling  
All study data will be pooled across study sites to facilitate hypothesis testing in accordance with the sample size estimation and power analysis (Section 6.3) .  
Comparability between study sites may be shown using summary statistics calculated by [CONTACT_3725].

groups will not be statistically assessed in this prospective randomized clinical trial.   
There are no preplanned subgroup analyses; however, potential baseline covariates with possible impact on outcomes at 3 months are: 
• Age  
• Race 
• Sex 
• BMI  
• Allergic status (allergic rhinitis - nonallergic rhinitis)  
Results may be evaluated by [CONTACT_841784]. 
6.10 Primary Endpoint  Analysis 
Primary e fficacy will be evaluated using the proportions of successful outcomes 
(responders) on the primary outcome measure  (1 NOSE class improvement or 
improvement (decrease) in NOSE Scale score of ≥ 20% from baseline)  at 13 weeks . 
The proportions of successful pa rticipants  at 13 weeks in each group will be

Note: T
his definition includes events related to the investigational medical 
device or the comparator. This definition also includes events related to the procedure s involved. For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to 
events related to the use of investigational medical devices.   
Serious Adverse Event  (
 SAE)  - an adverse event that led to any of the 
following ( per ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2020):  
a) de ath, 
b) serious deterioration in the health of the subject,  users or other persons 
as defined by [CONTACT_10980]:  
1) a life -threatening illness or injury,  or 
2) a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function 
including chronic disease, or  
3) in-patien t or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or 
4) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening 
illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or 
a body function,

Note : Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a procedure 
required by [CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration in health, is not 
considered a serious adverse event.  
Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  – adverse event related to the use of an 
inves tigational medical device .  
Note : T his definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use , deployment , implantation, installation, or 
operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. This 
definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device. This includes comparator if the comparator is a medical device (per ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2020). 
Serious A
dverse D evice  Effect (SADE)  - an adve rse device effect that has 
resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event (per ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2020). 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  - any
  serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any othe r 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (per 21 CFR 812.3(s)). 
Relationship to device and procedure 
The potential relationship of the event to the device or procedure  will be 
categorized by [CONTACT_3470]: 
• N ot related  
An adverse event for which sufficient information exists to indicate 
that there is no causal connection between the event and the device or procedure. The adverse event is due to and readily explained by [CONTACT_2299] ’s underlying disease state or is due to concomitant 
medication or therapy not related to the use of the device or the procedure. In addition, the adverse event may not follow a reasonable 
temporal sequence following the procedu re. 
• U
nlikely  
The relationship with the use of the device or procedure seems not relevant and/or the adverse event can be reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained.  
• P
ossibly related  
There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been primarily caused by [CONTACT_239060]. The adverse event has a 
reasonable temporal relationship to the use of the device or the 
  CTP1006 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – VATRAC   
 
 Page 48 of 62  CONFIDENTIAL  
procedure and follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
device or procedure, but alternative etiology is equally or more likely compared to the potential relationship to the use of th e device or the 
procedure. 
• P
robably related 
There is a reasonable probability that the adverse event may have been primarily caused by [CONTACT_41491]. The adverse event has a reasonable temporal relationship to the use of the device or the procedure and follows a known or expected response pattern to the device or procedure , and an alternative etiology is unlikely or 
significantly less likely . 
• D
efinitely related  
The adverse event has a strong causal relationship to the device or procedure. The adve rse event follows a strong temporal relationship to 
the use of the device or the procedure, follows a known response 
pattern to the device  or procedure, and cannot be reasonably explained 
by [CONTACT_143140] ’s clinical state or othe r 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Every effort should be made to determine the cause of each adverse event, because a judgment must be made as to the relationship to the device or procedure. If an investigator cannot assign a causality category the event will be considered pos sibly related for reporting and analysis.  
Note : The occurrence of a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a pre-
existing condition, unless the condition becomes more severe or increases in frequency, would not be considered procedure or device related. 
Intensity of adverse events :  
• Mild  
The adverse event is noticeable to the participant but does not interfere 
with routine activity.  
• Mo derate  
The adverse event interferes with routine activity but responds to 
symptomatic therapy or rest. 
• S evere  
The adverse event significantly limits the participant 's ability to 
perform routine activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795]. The adverse event requires medical or surgical treatment or results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

• Causality (in relation to the device or proce dure)  
• Unexpectedness  
Signs and symptoms considered normal postprocedure recovery (eg, postprocedure pain, transient sensory symptoms, fever, postanesthesia symptoms) do not have to be reported as adverse events. If these events require treatment outside t hat which is considered normal or if the event lasted 
longer in duration than normal, they should be reported as adverse events.

Methodology:  
This OLE  study  (CL04041024)  includes an 82-week open -label Treatment Period following completion of 1 of 
the core studies (Study CL04041022, CL04041023, or CL04041025) from Visit 1 (OLE Baseline/ Week  24) to 
Visit 10 ( End of Treatment [EoT]/Week 106), followed by a 20-week Safety Follow -Up Period from Week [ADDRESS_927937] visit of the OLE  study is the same visit as the Week 24 visit in the core studies.  
An estimated 1880 subjects will receive OKZ:  
1. OKZ 64  mg q4w:  SC injection of OKZ  64 mg q4w + methotrexate (MTX)  
2. OKZ 64  mg q2w:  SC i njection of O KZ 64  mg q2w + MTX  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 OKZ treatment groups in the OLE study based on the treatment 
received in the core studies.  Subjects who received OKZ (q2w or q4w) in the core study in which they 
participated (including subjects  who received placebo in Study CL04041025 and were re -randomized to OKZ

(Study CL04041022 and CL04041023 ) or adalimumab (Study CL04041023) in the core study in which they 
participated will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_927938] 12 weeks of the OLE, all subjects will be required to remain on a s table dose of background MTX 
at 15  to 25  mg/week (or ≥10  mg/week if there is documented intolerance to higher doses) with a stable  route of 
administration (oral, SC, or intramuscular [IM ]).  After 12  weeks ( Visit 4  [Week 36 ] of the OLE  study ), the 
Investigator may adjust the MTX dosage and route, per local guidelines.  Methotrexate may be adjusted only for 
safety reasons according to Investigator discretion before Visit 4 (Week 36) of the OLE study.  
Subjects who are on rescue disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) during the core studies will be 
asked to continue these medications for the first [ADDRESS_927939] these 
background medications if deemed appropriate after Visit 4 ( Week 36 ) of the OLE  study . Background  rescue  
therapy  may be adjusted only for safety reasons according to Investigator discretion before Visit 4 (Week 36) of 
the OLE study.  
Throughout the study, concomitant treatment with folic acid ≥[ADDRESS_927940] dose of open -label study treatment  in the OLE study will be administered at Week  104 for all subjects .  
After completion of the 82-week open -label Treatment Period , subjects will enter the 20-week Safety 
Follow -Up Period .  During the Safety Follow -Up Period , subjects will return for 3  visits  at +4, +8, and 
+[ADDRESS_927941] study treatment  administration and then return for the 3 Safety Follow -Up Visit s +4, +8, 
and +[ADDRESS_927942] study trea tment  administration.  
Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study period and evaluated using the Common Technology 
Criteria version 4.0 (CTCAE v  4.0). 
There will be ongoing monitoring of safety events, including laboratory findings by [CONTACT_4885] .  
In addition, safety will be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_139809] 
(DSMB).

Calculation of Sample Size  
It is estimated that 1880 subjects will be enrolled in the OLE  study  after having completed a core study.  
Analysis Populations  
 Safety population:  The Safety population will include all subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study 
treatment  during the OLE  study .  Subjects in the Safety population will be analyzed according to the 
treatment they actually received.  
 Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT) population:  The mITT population will include all subjects who sign 
an Informed Consent for participation in the OLE  study , are randomized in the OLE  study , and receive 
at least 1  dose of study treatment  in the OLE  study .  Subjects will be analyzed according to the study 
treatment group to which they are randomized in the OLE  study .  The mITT population will be the 
primary efficacy  analysis population.  
 Per Protocol (PP) population:  The PP population will include all mITT subjects who do not have any 
major protocol violations .  Subjects will be analyzed according to the study treatment group to which 
they are randomized .  The PP pop ulation will be used for supportive analyses selected efficacy 
endpoints.  
Safety Analysis  
The main components for the safety analysis will include:   
 All AEs (and SAEs) will be solicited at every study visit, recorded, and coded according to the most 
recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  
 Vital signs and physical examination findings  
 Laboratory parameters  
 Electrocardiogram (ECG) and other specialized test findings  
Changes from OLE Baseline  value in safety parameters will be summarized based on the definition of 
OLE  Baseline  value as the last available measurement prior to the first OLE dose of study treatment .  
Additionally, changes from Core Baseline  will be summarized based on the baselin e value from the core study 
(i.e., the last available measurement prior to the first dose of study treatment  in the core study).   For subjects 
from Study CL04041025 who initiate OKZ treatment at Week [ADDRESS_927945] and summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT) according to the most recent version of  the MedDRA .  In addition, summaries of AEs by 
[CONTACT_684822] .  Follow -up-adjusted incidence rates and event 
rates per [ADDRESS_927946] -years of follow -up over the course of the core study and the OLE will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_684823] .  All safety and tolerability data recorded during the study will be listed 
and summarized by [CONTACT_684824], and over time, as appropriate.  
The above collected clinical  database will be summarized and presented with particular focus on the following 
safety concerns identified as AESIs based either upon the safety data available to date ( refer to the most recent 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure) for OKZ or drug class -related events f or a biologic, including 
IL-6 inhibitor s: 
 Infections (particularly serious infections), tuberculosis, opportunistic infections  
 Malignancies  
- The Investigator will be asked to provide relevant medical information/documentation 
(e.g.,  pathology/histology repo rts) on all the malignancies cases, whether considered serious 
or not, as these cases will be recorded in the safety database.  
 Elevation of blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (e.g. , hypercholesterolemia, blood cholesterol increased, blood

 Systemic injection reactions and hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis  
 Gastrointestinal perfora tion 
 Cardiovascular (CV) events  
 Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and pancytopenia  
 Hepatotoxicity  
- The Investigator will be asked to provide relevant medical information/documentation (e.g., 
laboratory test results, including tests for viral he patitis and, if performed, liver biopsy ) on all 
hepatotoxicity  cases, whether considered serious or not, as these cases will be recorded in the 
safety database  
 Injection site reactions  
 Demyelination in peripheral or central nervous system  
 Autoimmune disord ers 
Cardiovascular Risk Assessment  
The RA population is known to have an increased risk of CV events .  The following approach is proposed to 
fully assess the CV risks associated with OKZ:  
 Potential MACE will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_82647] 
(CVAC ) according to a predefined charter .  The charter will define the criteria, data, and source 
documentation required to adjudicate all MACE . 
 Baseline ( of the core study) CV risks including individual risk factors (e.g., tobacco use, presence of 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lipid profile ) will be assessed.  
 Known CV risk factors will be monitored and assessed to detect any trends over long -term exposure.  
Time from first exposure to OKZ treatment (either in the core study or OLE  study ) to first adjudicated MACE 
event will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier methodology by [CONTACT_1570].  
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted using the mITT population .  Changes from OLE Baseline  value in efficacy 
parameters will be summarized based on the definition of OLE Baseline  value as the last available 
measurement prior to the first OLE dose of study treatment .  Additionally, changes from Core Baseline  will be 
summarized based on the basel ine value from the core study (i.e., the last available measurement prior to the 
first dose of study treatment  in the core study) .  For subjects from Study CL04041025 who initiate OKZ 
treatment at Week [ADDRESS_927947] pre -OKZ value will also be summarized.   There will be no inferential comparisons between treatment 
groups for efficacy assessments.  Descriptive summaries will be provided for each efficacy parameter over time 
by [CONTACT_1570].  
Assessment of Nonresponders  
Starting at Visit 4 ( Week  36) and then at all onsite visits until the end of the open -label Treatment Period, all 
subjects will be assessed for response  to treatment , with no nresponders  defined as subjects who d o not improve 
by [CONTACT_2669] 20% in swollen and tender joint counts (66 -68 joint  assessment ) from the Core  Baseline assessment .  
Investigators will be requested to review carefully the response status at these time points and make appropriate 
actions based on  local guidelines regarding management of the subjects, including possible adjustments in 
background therapy or withdrawal from the study.  
Safety Follow -up Assessments  
Given the long half -life of OKZ (approximately 31  days), a [ADDRESS_927948] scheduled dose of study treatment , Visit 10  (the EoT Visit) will take place at 
Week 106.  For subjects who discontinue treatment prematurely , the EoT Visit will take place 2 weeks after the

Amendment 2 :  06 March 2019  22 Confidential  2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune/inflammatory disease characterized by 
[CONTACT_386537], with synovial cell proliferation and destructive changes in bone and 
cartilage of multiple joints .  Untreated, RA can lead to destruction, deformation, and 
dysfunction of affected joints, which may result in significant morbidity, and accelerated 
mortality ( Jacobsson et al, 2007 ).  Moderately to severely active RA is often treated with 
disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), with methotrexate (MTX) being the 
most commonly used conventional DMARD (cDMARD) .  For patients with an inadequate 
response to cDMARDs, biologic agents (i.e., biologic DMARDs [bDMARDs]) are the next 
step, and include, but are not l imited to, tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF -α) inhibitors (TNFi), 
interleukin -6 (IL-6) receptor (IL -6R) antagonists, and T -cell co -stimulation modulators .  
Among these, TNFi, especially in combination with MTX, are used most often 
(Smolen  et al, 2014 ).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_386507]/or bDMARD therapy, 
approximately 30% to 40% of patients with established RA fail to respond and 50% to 60% 
of patients fail to achieve a major clinical American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
response or good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response 
(Marchesoni  et al, 2009 ; Rubbert -Roth and Finckh, 2009 ; Cohen et al, 2008 ).  Even among 
responders, the majority do not achieve remission .  Thus, there continues to be an unmet 
medical need for new therapeutic approaches in the RA patient population.  
One such therapeutic approach is to target  IL-[ADDRESS_927969] differentiation , which subsequently contributes to joint 
destruction .  Due to the key role played by [CONTACT_8668] -6 in se veral RA mechanisms, targeting IL -6 is 
considered an attractive therapeutic option.  
2.2 Study Treatment  
2.2.1 Olokizumab  
Olokizumab (OKZ; CDP6038 ; L04041 ) is being developed by R-Pharm International  for the 
treatment of moderately to severely active RA .  Olokizumab was previously developed by 
[CONTACT_684825], and was transferred to R-Pharm International  for further global 
development.  
R-Pharm International  
CL0404102 4:  Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 4 
Olokizumab  
Amendment 2 :  06 March 2019  23 Confidential  Olokizumab is a humanized (complementarity determining region [CDR] -grafted) 
monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) of immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa i sotype, developed as an 
antagonist of IL -[ADDRESS_927970] utility in a wide range of 
autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.  
Interleukin -6 is a multifunctional cytokine that has been shown to play a central role in 
immune regulation, inflammation,  hemopoiesis, and oncogenesis, and has been linked to a 
wide range of human diseases .  It is a glycoprotein of 184  amino acids that is produced by a 
wide range of cell types including monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, epi[INVESTIGATOR_386508], vascular en dothelial cells, renal mesangial cells, glial cells, chondrocytes, 
T and B cells, and some tumor cells .  Stimuli of IL -6 production include TNF -α, 
lipopolysaccharides, and viral infections; inhibitors of IL -6 production include 
glucocorticoids .  Within the  context of an immune and inflammatory response, IL -6 has been 
shown to exert a wide range of effects, such as those described below:  
 Induction of antibody production by B cells  
 Important role in the generation of a subpopulation of T -helper cells, Th17 ce lls, 
which may play an important pathogenic role in a number of autoimmune diseases  
 Key driver of the acute phase response (the increased production, mainly by [CONTACT_4852], 
of soluble factors, such as C -reactive protein [CRP] and serum amyloid A [SAA], 
durin g inflammation)  
In developi[INVESTIGATOR_386509] -6, potential therapeutic strategies include inhibition 
of nonsignaling IL-6R receptor alpha chain (gp80), which gives the IL -6 family members 
their specificity, and the IL-6R signal -transducing subunit (gp130) .  The identification of the 
optimum epi[INVESTIGATOR_386510] -6 (binding IL -6 in a region that is predicted to be involved 
with gp80 or gp130) was conducted using antibodies with similar affinities , but different 
binding axes, as determined by [CONTACT_684826] e plasmon resonance ( BIAcore ).  Antibodies directed 
against mouse or human IL -[ADDRESS_927971] under a range of conditions tested.

CL0404102 4:  Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 4 
Olokizumab  
Amendment 2 :  [ADDRESS_927972] commonly used.  For patients with an inadequate response to 
cDMARDs, biologic agents that inhibit TNF -, especially in combination wit h MTX, are 
indicated (Smolen et al, 2014 ).  Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of patients receiving 
biologics (i .e., approximately 40% to 50% of those receiving TNFi therapy ) have inadequate 
response to such treatment ( Marchesoni et al, 2009 ; Rubbert -Roth and Finckh, 2009 ; 
Cohen  et al, 2008 ).  Thus , there is an unmet need for new therapeutic approaches utilizing 
alternative modes of action in this patient population.  
Olokizumab is being developed to address the unmet needs of patients with these severe, 
progressive, and debilitating disorders through a different therapeutic approach, utilizing an 
alternative mode of action .  Within the class of therapeutic antibodies targeting the 
IL-[ADDRESS_927973], OKZ is anticipated to be more potent because of its high affinity for IL -6 and 
its axis of intervention (inhibiting the interaction between IL -6 and gp130) .  Also, since OKZ 
is of the I g G4 isotype, it would not be expected to mediate significant levels of 
antibody -mediated complement fixation or cell -mediated cytotoxicity.  
Olokizumab is being developed for the treatment of RA to reduce signs and symptoms of 
disease  and improve physical functioning .  The proposed indication for OKZ is to be used in 
combination with MTX for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA in adult 
patients who have been inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_684827] .

level (NOAEL) of 200  mg/kg /week and 50  mg/kg/week after intravenous ( IV) and 
subcutaneous ( SC) administration , respectively . 
In a study aimed at assessing the effects of OKZ  on prenatal and postnatal development in 
the cynomolgus monkey, the treatment was well tolerated during the pregnancy and had no 
abortifacient effect.  However, some OKZ -treated females experienced dystocia and 
placental retention, sometimes associated wi th significant urogenital bleeding, which resulted 
in some deaths.  Given similar human and cynomolgus monkey physiology and the risk of 
dystocia and hemorrhage at parturition, inhibition of IL -6 signaling during pregnancy is not 
recommended . 
Taken togethe r, the currently completed nonclinical studies support continued clinical 
development for marketing approval of OKZ.  
2.2.3 Summary of Clinical Experience  
Nonclinical data were deemed sufficient to support clinical development of OKZ in humans 
for the treatment o f moderately to severely active RA (lead indication), other auto -immune 
inflammatory diseases, and oncological diseases with IL -[ADDRESS_927976] been investigated in 3  Phase  I clinical studies 
(RA0001, RA0010, and  RA0074) and 2  Phase II clinical studies (RA0056 and RA0083) .  
The safety and efficacy of OKZ were also studied in long -term open -label extension (OLE) 
studies for both Phase II studies (RA0057  and RA0089).  
The information in this section of the protocol regarding clinical studies with OKZ  is current 
as of 29 January 2016  (for updated information on results of clinical studies , refer to the most 
recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure ).

Amendment 2 :  06 March 2019  27 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of Safety Data from Olokizumab  Studies  
Study RA0001  
There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during the study and no 
subject discontinued the study as a result of an adverse event (AE) .  The overall incidence of 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was slightly higher in the placebo group overall 
(18 subjects [52.9%]; 35  events) than in the OKZ treatment groups overall (11  subjects 
[33.3%]; 26  events) .  No increase in the incidence of TEAEs was o bserved with increasing 
dose of OKZ.  
The most commonly  reported TEAEs were in the system organ classes (SOCs) of 
gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, general disorders, and infections and infestations .  The 
incidence of GI disorders was similar in both the OKZ  group overall (12.1%) and the placebo 
group overall (11.8%); however, at the preferred term (PT) level, abdominal distension 
([ADDRESS_927977] [3.0%]), abdominal pain ([ADDRESS_927978] [3.0%]), and vomiting (2  subjects [6.1%]) were 
only seen in the OKZ group .  The most  frequently reported TEAEs (occurring in ≥3% of 
subjects in any treatment group) by [CONTACT_386544] -like illness (11.8% placebo, 
6.1% OKZ), headache (11.8% placebo, 3.0%  OKZ), nasopharyngitis (8.8% placebo, 
3.0% OKZ), rhinitis (8.8% placebo, 0.0% OKZ), d iarrhea (5.9% placebo, 3.0% OKZ), and 
vomiting (0.0% placebo, 6.1% OKZ).  
For the majority of hematology  and clinical chemistry parameters there were no clinically 
significant differences in mean actual values between the placebo group and OKZ treatment 
groups, and no clinically significant fluctuations in mean actual values over time.  
Study RA0010  
There were no deaths during Study RA0010 .  Two subjects ([ADDRESS_927979] in the placebo 
IV + MTX group and [ADDRESS_927980] in the OKZ 1  mg/kg SC  + MTX group) experienced SAEs :  
Bowen’s disease and worsening of RA, respectively .  Neither event was considered by [CONTACT_386545] .  One subject in the placebo  + MTX overall 
group withdrew from the study as a result of exacerbation of their RA .  All subjects (100%) 
in the placebo  + MTX overall group and 96.7% of subjects in the OKZ  + MTX overall group 
experienced at least 1  TEAE .  The incidence of TEAEs did not increase with increasing dose 
of OKZ  + MTX administered ; although , a slightly higher number of AEs were experienced 
by [CONTACT_386546]  (1 mg/kg and 3  mg/kg)  + MTX SC treatment groups 
(16 subjects  [94.12%]; 101  events) compared with the OKZ  (0.1 mg/kg and 1  mg/kg)  + MTX 
IV treatment groups (13  subjects [100%]; 54  even ts).

Amendment 2 :  06 March 20 19 28 Confidential  Study RA0074  
In Study RA0074, there were no deaths, SAEs, severe AEs, or AEs that led to 
discontinuation .  The incidence of TEAEs was higher in the OKZ groups compared with the 
placebo group .  In the placebo group, 50% of subjects (2  of 4) had TEAEs ( 6 events), 
compared with 75% of subjects (3  of 4) in the OKZ 3  mg/kg treatment group (11  events), and 
100% of subjects (4  of 4) in each of the OKZ 0.3  mg/kg (16  events), OKZ 1  mg/kg 
(25 events), and OKZ 6  mg/kg (24  events) treatment groups .  The incidence of TEAEs did 
not appear to be related to the dose of OKZ administered.  
The most commonly reported TEAEs were within the SOCs of general disorders and 
administration site conditions ; investigations ; GI disorders ; infections and infestations ; 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], th oracic and mediastinal disorders ; and skin and SC tissue disorders .  Events 
occurring in >20% of subjects in the OKZ overall group, by [CONTACT_6214], included injection site 
hematoma (31.3%), abdominal pain (25.0%), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased 
(25.0%) .  The overall incidence of TEAEs in the OKZ -treated groups was higher than in the 
placebo -treated group, but given the small number of subjects in each treatment group , it is 
not possible to make any meaningful conclusions.  
In Studies RA0001, RA001 0, and RA0074, OKZ was tolerated at doses of up to 3  mg/kg SC 
(all studies), 6  mg/kg SC ( Study RA0074 only), and 10  mg/kg IV ( Study RA0001 only) .  
There were no deaths in any of these studies and only [ADDRESS_927981] 
in Study RA0010  discontinued the study early due to an AE (exacerbation of RA symptoms), 
but no subjects withdrew from Study RA0001 or Study RA0074 due to TEAEs.  
Study RA0056  
In Study RA0056, OKZ was well tolerated at doses of up to 240  mg q2w .  Serious AEs were 
reported by  6 subjects in the OKZ groups and 3  subjects in the placebo groups .  A total of 
11 subjects in the OKZ and placebo groups discontinued due to TEAEs ([ADDRESS_927982] in the placebo group ).  Overall, [ADDRESS_927983] subjects discontinuing due to 
TEAEs in the OKZ 60  mg q4w group (5  subjects [22.7%] compared with 2  subjects [10%] in 
the OKZ [ADDRESS_927984] [4.5%] in the OKZ 120  mg q2w group, and 2  subjects 
[8.7%] in the OKZ 240 mg q2w group) .  One subject (4.5%) in the placebo q2w group also 
discontinued due to TEAEs .  No TEAE PT leading to discontinuation was reported by [CONTACT_26813] [ADDRESS_927985] in any treatment group.  
Treatment -emergent AEs were reported by 17  subjects (77.3%) in the placebo q4w group, 
19 subjects (86.4%) in the placebo q2w group, 18  subjects (81.8%) in the OKZ 60 mg

19 subjects each in the OKZ 240  mg q4w (86.4%) and OKZ 240  mg q2w (82.6%) groups .  
The majority of these TEAEs were reported during the Treatment Period.  
The most commonly reported TEAEs (>10% of subjects in any treatment group) in the 
OKZ  q4w, OKZ q2w, and placebo groups were in the SOCs of GI disorders, general 
disorders and administration site conditions, infections and infestations, investigations, and 
nervous system disorders.  
The TEAEs that occurred with the  greatest incidence (i.e., occurring in ≥10% of subjects) in 
any OKZ treatment group included :  diarrhea, injection site reaction, injection site pruritus, 
nasopharyngitis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], urinary tract infection, ALT increased, 
aspartat e aminotransferase (AST) increased, and liver function test (LFT) abnormal.  
When considering TEAEs by [CONTACT_386547] (CTCAE), the majority of subjects in all treatment groups (≥59.1%) had 
CTCAE Grade  [ADDRESS_927986] in the OKZ 60  mg q4w (4.5%) group who reported CTCAE Grade  3 TEAEs during 
the Safety Follow -Up Period .  No CTCAE Grade  4 or 5 TEAEs were observed in any 
treatment group .  There were no deaths reported in Study RA0056 .  Overall, 6  subjects in the 
OKZ groups reported 7  SAEs  (3 subjects [15.0%] reporting 3  events in the OKZ 60  mg q2w

Study RA0010  
Preliminary efficacy data in terms of the Disease Activity Score 28 -joint Count 
(DAS28 ) (CRP) were obtained in Study RA0010 .  An indication of the efficacy of OKZ was 
obtained in the subpopulation of subjects with a baseline DAS28  (CRP) of >3.2 (i.e., those 
with moderate to high disease activity) .  Although the number of subjects falling into this 
moderate to high category was small, improvements in DAS28  (CRP) were seen following 
OKZ  + MTX administration, especially in the OKZ 1  mg/kg  SC + MTX group.  
Study RA0056  
In Study RA0056, a greater improvement in least squares (LS) mean DAS28 (CRP) from 
baseline at Week  [ADDRESS_928008] improvement observed in th e OKZ 240  mg q2w group .  
The overall dose -response trend (across the q4w and q2w dosing frequencies) was 
statistically significant (p<0.0001) .  Comparisons of dosing frequency (q2w versus q4w) and 
dose-by-dose frequency interactions (q2w trend versus q4w t rend) were not statistically 
significant .  The secondary efficacy variables were ACR  20% (ACR20), 50% (ACR50), and 
70% (ACR70) response criteria at Week  12 for the OKZ and placebo treatment groups .  The 
ACR20  and ACR50  estimated response rates at Week  12 were higher in all OKZ treatment 
groups compared with the placebo groups .  Very few subjects in any treatment group were 
ACR70  responders; however, those subjects that were ACR70  responders were all in the 
OKZ treatment groups.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of P harmacokinetic  Data from Olokizumab  Studies  
Studies RA0001, RA0010, and RA0056  
Single dose PK of OKZ were studied in Studies RA0001  (healthy non -Asian), 
RA0074  (healthy Japanese), and RA0010 (subjects with RA) .  Sparse sampling following 
repeated administration of OKZ was performed in non-Asian and Asian subjects with RA in 
Studies RA0056 and RA0083, respectively .  Exposure to OKZ following single dose 
administration appeared to be similar in non-Asian and Asian volunteers .  Following SC 
administration, maximum plasma concentrations were generally re ached between 
approximately 4  days (in Study RA0074, 6  mg/kg SC) and 14  days (in Study RA0001, 
1 mg/kg SC) .  Over the 0.3  to 6 mg/kg SC dose range evaluated in Studies RA0001  and 
RA0074, the median terminal half -life ranged from 30.1  to 39.6  days.  The PK profile of 
OKZ in Study RA0010  (non-Asian RA volunteers) was similar to that seen in healthy 
volunteers in Study RA0001  for the same doses .  The maximum concentration of OKZ 
following SC administration was achieved within a median of 7  to 13  days following  
3 mg/kg and 1  mg/kg dosing, respectively .  The estimate of terminal half -life across doses 
and routes of administration was 31  days (median range :  12 to 63  days).  
Pharmacokinetic bioavailability of OKZ via SC administration was estimated to be 63% 
across  the 3  studies evaluated ( Studies RA0001, RA0010, and RA0056) .  Population PK 
analysis utilizing sparse plasma concentration versus time data collected in RA0056  along 
with intense PK data collected in Studies RA0001  and RA0010  indicated similar PK 
charact eristics of OKZ in subjects with moderately to severely active RA and in healthy 
subjects .  Body weight was found to be the only “statistically significant” covariate on 
volume of distribution.  
2.2.4 Rationale for Dose Selection  
The dose regimens of OKZ to be ev aluated in this Phase III study are 64 mg q2w and 
64 mg q4w.  These are the same doses investigated in the 3 core studies (CL04041022, 
CL04041023, and CL04041025).  The rationale for selecting these dose regimens is provided 
below.  
In the Phase II studies , RA0056 and RA0083, the primary efficacy variable was met in all 
OKZ treatment groups, demonstrating improvement compared with placebo groups and a 
statistically significant overall dose -response trend as evidenced by [CONTACT_386556]28 (CRP) .  Study RA0001 demonstrated that OKZ was pharmacologically active at 
R-Pharm International  
CL0404102 4:  Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 4 
Olokizumab  
Amendment 2 :  06 March 2019  37 Confidential  all doses tested .  This finding was supported by [CONTACT_684830] I/IIa study , RA0010, conducted in subjects with mild to moderate RA .  The 
data from these studies highlight the potency of OKZ as well as the existence of 
dose-response dependence, shown by [CONTACT_386558] .  The relatively flat concentration -effect relationship for  
safety outcomes and the dose -dependent occurrence of injection site reactions for the 
OKZ  [ADDRESS_928011] efficacy gains versus the 120  mg dose 
regimens, led to the exclusion of the 240 mg dose regimen from further evaluatio n in the 
Phase III program .  This decision was further supported by [CONTACT_386559] 2 injections of 120 mg OKZ in order to achieve the 240 mg dose level even 
with the new 160  mg/m L formulation . 
In a thorough dose -response analysis using the combined database from the [ADDRESS_928012] slightly lower efficacy in the modeling 
analysis ; however , in both Pha se II studies that were conducted in relatively difficult to treat 
population of subjects  resistant to 1 or more TNFi biologics, the 60 mg monthly treatment 
groups showed statistically significant efficacy .  While there was not a detectable increase in 
safety events observed with doses above 120 mg monthly, there also did not seem to be a 
substantial gain in efficacy with higher doses .  Thus, the 120 mg monthly dose, administered 
as either 60  mg q2w or 120  mg q4w, seemed to be associated with optimal eff icacy/safety 
ratio.  The lower [ADDRESS_928013] volume that can be used in Phase III (0.4 mL) results in a nominal 
dose of 64 mg rather than 60 mg . 
Consequently, using the primary efficacy outcomes from individual Phase II studies, and 
additional dose -response analysis performed on a comb ined database derived from these 
studies, 2  OKZ dose regimens were selected for further investigation :  64 mg SC q2w and 
64 mg SC q4w since the totality of the data strongly suggested that both of these dose 
regimens could potentially be successful in a la rge Phase III program.  
2.3 Rationale for the Study  
The multicenter , open -label  design used in this study is consistent with the precedent set for  
Phase III OLE trials of other biologics and is in accordance with health authority guidelines . 
The goal of this Phase III study is to evaluate the long-term safety , tolerability , and efficacy  
of OKZ in subjects with moderately to severely active RA w ho previously completed

CL0404102 4:  Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 4 
Olokizumab  
Amendment 2 :  [ADDRESS_928014] dose of OKZ at Week 24.  For subjects 
transitioning from the adalimumab treatment group (core study CL04041023), there will be 
no additional time added for wash out of adalimumab other than the [ADDRESS_928015] 
dose of adalimumab in the core study (Week 22) and first dose of OKZ in the OLE study 
(Visit 1  [Week 24 ]).  Similar approaches have been implemented in a number of other 
clinical studies  involving adalimumab and other biologics or kinase inhibitors, and such a 
switch from on e biologic to another is commonly observed  in clinical practice  without 
significant safety concerns  (By[CONTACT_684831], 2012 ; Furst et al, 2007 ; Schiff et al, 2009 ; 
Wollenhaupt et al, 2014 ).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831] , the possibility for an increased risk of AEs, including 
infections , cannot be excluded  (Humira® [adalimumab] Prescribing Information ).  This 
potential risk will be mitigated by [CONTACT_684832] . 
It is possible that  subjects assigned to the  adalimumab treatment group in core study 
CL04041023  might  achieve remission or a decrease in disease activity while being treat ed 
with adalimumab and  switching to another biological treatment may lead to undesirable 
results for such subjects.  H owever, it will not be known at the completion of the [ADDRESS_928016]’s completion  of the core study and prior to enrollment 
in the OLE study, the Investigator and subject  will decide jointly whether the subject  will 
continue with the open -label administration of OKZ in this OLE  study  or exit the study . 
2.4 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Olokizumab has undergone extensive nonclinical testing , and [ADDRESS_928017] been 
completed .  In the difficult -to-treat population of RA patients who previously failed TNFi 
therapy, OKZ has demonstrated efficacy in 2 Phase II studies (Study RA0056 [extended with 
Study RA0057] in 221 subjects and Study RA0083 [extended with Study RA0089] in 
119 Asian subjects) using the doses of OKZ that are proposed for this Phase III study ; at 
higher doses, the safety profile was similar .  Bioavailability of OKZ via SC administration 
was estimated to be 63% across 3  studies evaluated ( Studies RA0056, RA0001, and 
RA0010) . 
The clinical program to date suggests that OKZ is effective in reducing disease symptoms in 
subjects with RA , and that OKZ  is generally well tolerated (for further efficacy and safety 
information , refer to the most recent version of the Investigator ’s Brochure) .  The safety 
profile of OKZ is consistent with the known effects of IL -6 blockers.  Overall, the

CL0404102 4:  Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 4 
Olokizumab  
Amendment 2 :  06 March 2019  39 Confidential  benefit /risk profile for subjects in the proposed study is favorable .  The study will provide  
valuable information on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of OKZ in subjects with RA, 
which may subsequently help to address  the unmet medical needs for this patient population.  
The design of this study contains adequate measures to mitigate risk factors and adequate 
safety monitoring to protect the subjects.   All subjects will be eligible for modification of 
background therapy  (i.e., MTX for all subjects, sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine for 
subjects assigned rescue medication in the core studies , and oral corticosteroids [if 
applicable] ), adm inistration of parenteral  corticosteroids, and modification of non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs ) after 12 weeks of open -label treatment  (see 
Section  6.13.3), according to Investigator discretion and local practice .  In addition, all 
subjects will be assessed at Visit 4 ( Week  36) and then at all onsite visits until the end of the 
study treatment administration for response  to treatment , with nonresponders defined as 
subjects who do not improve by [CONTACT_2669] 20% in swollen and tender joint counts (66 -68 joint  
assessment ) from the Core  Baseline assessment .  Investigators will be requested to review 
carefully the response status at these tim e points and make appropriate actions based on local 
guidelines regarding management of the subjects, including possible adjustments in 
background therapy or withdrawal from the study.  
In the context of the progressive, severe, and debilitating nature of R A, the balance between 
risks that have been identified from cumulative safety data for OKZ and the anticipated 
efficacy/benefit remains favorable.

5.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a multicenter , open -label , Phase  III study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
OKZ in subjects with moderately to severely active RA  who previously completed 24 weeks 
of double -blind treatment in Study CL04041022, CL04041023, or CL04041025 . 
This study will be conducted at approximately 250 global sites across Russia, Belarus, 
the US, Europe , the United Kingdo m ([LOCATION_006]), Asia, and Latin America.  It is est imated that 
approximately  1880  subjects will be enrolled . 
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility to enter the study at Visit 1  (which is the same visit as 
the Week 24 visit of the core studies ), and eligible subjects will be assigned to 1 of 2 dosing 
frequencies (q2w or q4w) of [ADDRESS_928020] dose of OKZ  
being  administered at  Week  104.  After completion of the open -label  Treatment Period , 
subjects will come to Visit 10  (End of Treatment [EoT]/Week  106) [ADDRESS_928021] 
dose of OKZ  for scheduled safety and efficacy assessments .  After Visit 10  (EoT/Week 106) , 
subjects will be scheduled for Safety Follow -Up Visit s SFU-1 (Week  108), SFU-2 
(Week  112), and SFU-3 (Week  126) to perform adequate safety assessments . 
The total amount of time to complete the OLE study will be approximately 102 weeks 
(inclusive of the open -label Treatment Period and the Safety Follow -Up Period).  The total 
amount of time to complete both the core study and the OLE study will be approximately 
130 weeks (2.5 years) (inclusive of the Screening , double -blind Trea tment Period, open -label 
Treatment Period , and Safety Follow -Up Period ). 
Subjects who discontinue treatment prematurely will be required to come to Visit 10 
(EoT/Week 106)  [ADDRESS_928022]  dose of study treatment  for scheduled efficacy and 
safety assessments .  These subjects will subsequently be followed for an additional 20  weeks 
(i.e., 22 weeks after the final dose of study treatment ) during a Safety Follow -Up Period.  
A schematic of the study design is presented in Figure 1.  The Schedule of Events to be 
conducted during the 82-week open -label  Treatment P eriod ( Week 24 through Week  106) 
and the Safety Follow -Up Period (Week  106 through Week  126) is presented in Table  1.

After completing the 24 -week double -blind Treatment Period in 1 of the 3 core studies , an 
estimated 1880  subjects will be randomized  to 1 of 2 open -label treatment groups : 
1. OKZ 64 mg q4w:  SC injection of OKZ 64  mg q4w + MTX  
2. OKZ 64 mg q2w:  SC injection of OKZ 64  mg q2w + MTX  
Subjects will be randomized based on the treatment receive d in the core studies .  Subjects 
who received OKZ (q2w or q4w) in the core study in which they participated (including 
subjects who received placebo in Study CL04041025 and were re -randomized to OKZ at 
Week 16) will receive the same OKZ treatment regimen  in the OLE  study .  Subjects who 
received placebo (Study CL04041022 and Study CL04041023) or adalimumab 
(Study  CL04041023) in the core study in which they participated will be randomized in a 
1:[ADDRESS_928028]’s treatment assignment in the 
core studies:  
 Subjects randomized to OKZ in the 3 core studies (CL04041022, CL04041023, and 
CL04041025) will complete 106 total weeks of treatment with OKZ . 
 Subjects randomized to placebo in Study CL04041022 and to placebo or adalimumab 
in Study CL04041023 will complete 82 total weeks of treatment with OKZ . 
 Subjects randomized to placebo in Study CL04041025 will transition to OKZ at Week 
16 and complete 8 weeks of double -blind treatment with OKZ during the core study; 
these subjects will complete 90 total weeks of treatment with OKZ.  
Subcutaneous  injections of OKZ 64 mg will be administered q2w or q4w throughout the 
open -label Treatment Period, and all s ubjects (and their caregivers, if applicable) will be 
trained at Visit 1 (OLE Baseline/Week 24) to administer OKZ (see Section 6.8).

Section  6.2. 
Background Therapy  
As per inclusion criterion No. 3 (see Section  5.3.1 ), subjects must have been treated with 
MTX at a dose of 15  to 25  mg/week (or ≥10  mg/week if there is documented intolerance to 
higher doses) during the core study  with a stable dose and mode  of administration (oral, SC, 
or IM ).  For the first 12 weeks of t he OLE study (i.e., through Week 36),  the dose of MTX 
should remain unchanged and may be adjusted only for safety reasons  according to 
Investigator discretion  (see guidelines in Appendix 1 [see Section  13.1]).  After Visit 4 
(Week 36 ), the Investigator may adjust the MTX dosage and route, per local guidelines.  
Subjects who were prescribed rescue medication(s) (sulfasalazine and/or 
hydroxychloroquine) during the core studies will be asked to continue these medications at 
the same dose for the first 12 weeks of the OLE  study (i.e., through Visit 4  [Week 36 ]).  
After Visit 4 ( Week  36), the Investigator may adjust these background medications if deemed 
appropriate.  
Additional details regarding background therapy, including adjustments to background 
therapy that are permitted after Visit 4 ( Week  36), are provided in S ection 6.13.3 .

7.1.10  Health Assessments and P atient -Reported Outcome s  
The PROs that will be utilized for efficacy assessments are discussed in this section.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index  
The HAQ -DI is a patient -reported questionnaire that provides an assessment of the impact of 
the disease and its treatment on physical function .  The HAQ -DI assesses the degree of 
difficulty experienced in 8 domains of daily  living activities using 20  questions .  The 
domains are dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip , and 
common daily activities, and each domain (activity) consists of 2  or 3 items .  For each 
question , the level of difficulty is scored from 0  to 3 where 0  = without any difficulty, 
1 = with some difficulty, 2  = much difficulty, and 3  = unable to do .  Each category is given a 
score by [CONTACT_386594] (i.e., question in each category with the 
highest score f or that category).  
If the maximum score is 0  or 1, but a device related to that category is used, or help from 
another person is provided for the category, then the category score is increased to 2 .  If the 
category score is already a 2  (or above), the sco re in that category remains [ADDRESS_928083] responses, no disability score will be calculated.  
The HAQ -DI will also include patient assessments of pain and health on a scale of 0 to 100 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Short Form -36 
The SF -36 health survey is a patient -reported survey of health; it is commonly used in health 
economics as a variable in the quality -adjusted life year (QALY) calculation to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of a health treatment .  The SF -36 consists of 8  scaled scores, which are the 
weighted sums of the questions in their section .  Each scale is directly transformed into a 0  to 
100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight .  The lower the score the 
more disability .  The higher the score , the less disability (i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to 
maximum disability and a score of 100  is equivalent to no disability).

[IP_ADDRESS]  European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensions  
The conceptual basis of the EQ -5D is the holistic view of health, including both the medical 
definition  and the fundamen tal importance of independent physical, emotional , and social 
functioning .  The concept of health in EQ -5D also encompasses both positive aspects 
(well -being) and negative aspects (illness).  
The EQ -5D consists of a questionnaire and a VAS and is a self -rated health status .  The 
EQ-5D records the subject’s perceptions of their own current overall health, and can be used 
to monitor changes with time .  The self -assessment questionnaire is a description of 
5 dimensions (i.e., mobility, self -care, usual activiti es, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression) .  The subject is asked to grade their own current level of function in each 
dimension into 1  of 5 degrees of disability ( extreme, severe, moderate , slight, or none) .  The 
combination of these with the conditions  “death” and “unconscious” enables a description of 
3127  different health states .  Each health state can be ranked and transformed as a single 
score called the utility . 
The EQ -5D health states  may be converted into a single summary index by [CONTACT_2931] a 
formula that attaches values to each of the levels in each dimension .  The index can be 
calculated by [CONTACT_386595] 1, the value for full health (i.e., state 
[ZIP_CODE]) .  Value sets have been derived for EQ -5D in several countries usin g the European 
Quality of Life -5 Dimensions Visual Analog Scale (EQ -5D VAS) valuation technique or the

circumstances surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to 
determine whether or not an AE is consid ered to be related to the study treatment .  The 
causal relationship between the study treatment  and the AE must be characterized as 
“related” or “not related” .  The following guidance should be taken into consideration:  
 Temporal relationship of event onset  to the initiation of the study treatment . 
 Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction,

treatment (e.g., antibiotic, antiviral, etc) will be monitored and evaluated.  Investigators will 
also educate subjects, parents, and/or caregivers about the symptoms of infections and will 
provide instructions on dealing with these infections . 
Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of OKZ in subjects with a 
history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes) that may 
predispose subjects to infections.  Study Treatment  should not be administered to subjects 
with active  or clinically significant  infection.  Vigilance for timely detection of serious 
infection is recommended for subjects receiving biologic agents for treatment of RA, as signs 
and symptoms of acute inflamma tion may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase 
reaction.  Subjects must be instructed to contact [CONTACT_466055], in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate

For injections  administered by [CONTACT_423] (or caregiver, if applicable) , subjects will record in 
the Subject Diary (see Section 5.5) any complaints, signs, or symptoms that occur during or 
after the injection.  S ubjects will be asked to contact [CONTACT_684854] [ADDRESS_928100] 1 of the following signs or symptoms 
occurring during or within 2 hours of the study treatment  injection:  
 Hypotension  
 Urticaria  
 Flushing  
 Facial or hand edema  
 Throat tig htness, oral cavity, or lip edema  
 Headache  
 Shortness of breath . 
The Investigator should report any AE of acute systemic injection reaction as 
“anaphylaxis” if it meets the Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis, as specified 
in Appendix 3 (Section  13.3). 
The study site must have adequate arrangements to manage anaphylactic reactions . 
Delayed injection reactions are usually defined as at least 2 of the following 4 signs or 
symptoms occurring within 1 day to 14 days following the injection:  
 Rash  
 Fever (more than 100°F [38°C])

[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatotoxicity  
The Investigator will be asked to provide relevant medical information/documentation (e.g., 
laboratory test results) for all serious and non -serious cases of potential hepatotoxicity . 
Potential hepatotoxicity is defined as laboratory resul ts that fulfill any of the following 
criteria (in all cases, AST may be substituted for ALT if ALT results are not available):  
 ALT >3× to ≤5× ULN  
 ALT >5× ULN  
 ALT >3× ULN and total bilirubin >2× ULN  
Laboratory results that satisfy any of the criteria for potential hepatotoxicity  should be 
followed by a repeat test within [ADDRESS_928101] bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase ( GGT ), INR, alkaline phosphatase, creatine 
phosphokinase, and hematology assessment.   After that, testing should be repeated at least 
weekly and followed until resolution, stabilization, or return to baseline values.  Additional  
testing may be limited to ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin if all other 
laboratory results are wit hin normal limits.  The number of LFTs included in each repeat 
testing may be further reduced to include only those param eters which remain abnormal (i.e., 
abnormalities that stabilize, resolve, or return to within baseline values do not require repeat 
testing).  
Potential hepatotoxicity events that  fulfill  any of the following criteria must also be recorded 
as SAEs in the eCRF  (in all cases, AST may be substituted for ALT if ALT results are not 
available):  
 ALT >3× ULN and total bilirubin >2× ULN  
 ALT >8× ULN  at any time, regardless of total bilirubin or accompanying symptoms

quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash , eosinophilia [>5%] ) 
For SAEs of potential hepatotoxicity , the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_386604], as additional test s are needed to investigate all potential causes of liver toxicity 
(e.g., alcohol  use, hepatitis infection, biliary tract disease, and concomitant medications).  
Work -up includes, but is not limited to:  
 Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  
 Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications 
and herbal/dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets.  
 Ruling out acute viral hepatitis (types A, B, C, D, and E), cytomegalovirus, 
Epstein -Barr virus, autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, 
hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy, and biliary tract disease.  
 Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
 Obtaining addi tional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin, biliary tract ultrasonography/imaging results, liver biopsy).  
 Considering  gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
All additional investigations should be rec orded i n the eCRF via the EDC system, and all 
records should be kept as source documents at the study site.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Injection Site Reactions  
An injection site reaction is any untoward medical event occurring at the injection site during 
or after study treatment  administration that can be at least possibly attributed to the study 
treatment  (i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out) . 
An assessment of pain, redness, swelling, induration, hemorrhage, and itching at the injection 
site will be performed.  At all spe cified visits (see Table  1), the assessment of injection site 
reactions that have occurred since the previous visit will be made by [CONTACT_684855].   Injection site reactions noticed after on -site study

Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data.  However, if any subject responses 
suggestive of a possible AE are identified during study site revie w of the PRO 
questionnaires, study site staff will alert the Investigator, who will determine if the criteria 
for an AE have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the subject's 
medical record per study site practice.  If the event me ets the criteria for an AE, it will be 
reported on the AEs eCRF.  
Information contained within the subject diary (see Section 5.5) will not be considered PRO 
data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of S erious Adverse Events  
All SAEs  that occur at or after Visit 1 ( OLE Baseline /Week 24) , regardless of the 
Investigator’s assessment on causality , must be recorded on the relevant  pages of the eCRF 
and reported to R-Pharm International  according to  protocol requirements.  
Investigators must report the SAE within [ADDRESS_928106] becoming aware of the event using the back -up paper SAE report form 
(instructions provided in the Investigator binders) .  Once the EDC system is operating 
normally again, Investigators must enter the SAE in the eCRF pages .  All SAEs should be

Follow -Up Period is not required to be reported unless the Investigator thinks that an event 
may be r elated to either the study treatment , study treatment  administration, or a protocol 
procedure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of S erious Adverse Events  to Regulatory Authorities and 
Investigators  
R-Pharm  International ’s designee will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, 
ethics committees, and Investigators, in accordance with national regulations in the countries

for other safety issues where these might materially alter the current benefit -risk assessment 
of OKZ or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the study treatment  administration 
or in the overa ll conduct of the study .  The study site will also forward a copy of all 
expedited reports to the relevant  Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) in accordance with national regulations.

Any AEs that occur at or after Visit 1 ( OLE Baseline /Week 24) until the end of the Safety 
Follow -Up Period (i.e., [ADDRESS_928109] dose of study treatment ) will be followed up  
to resolution.  Resolution means that the subject has returned to a baseline stat e of health, the 
Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE, or the subject is lost to 
follow -up.  The Investigator should follow each SAE until the event is resolved or returned to 
the baseline , the event is assessed as st able by [CONTACT_737], the subject is lost to

If the subject is lost to follow -up, the SAE will be categorized based on the Investigator’s last 
assessment .  Every effort should be made to fol low all SAEs considered to be related to OKZ 
or study -related procedures until an outcome can be reported.  
During the study, resolution of SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the SAE page of 
the eCRF and in the subject’s medical record to facilitate source data verification .  If, after

7.4.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory tests will be reviewed for results of potential clinical significance at all 
time points throughout the study .  The Investigator will evaluate any change in laboratory 
values .  If the Investiga tor determines a laboratory abnormality to be clinically significant, it 
is considered a laboratory AE; however, if the abnormal laboratory value is consistent with a 
current diagnosis  (or signs or symptoms if a diagnosis is not possible)  and is not a clin ically 
significant worsening from the baseline laboratory parameter , it should be documented 
accordingly without being reported as a  separate laboratory  AE.  The central laboratory will

[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs  
Vital signs ( temperature, h eart rate, BP, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ) will be measured as indicated in 
Table  1, and when clinically indicated .  Whenever possible, vital sign assessments should be 
performed by [CONTACT_386613](s) 
throughout the study .  Blood pressure and heart rate should be measured after the subject 
rests 5  minutes in a sitting position . 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE .  A vital sign result should be reported as 
an AE if it meets any of the following criteria:  
 Results in a change in RA treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, 
or treatment discontinuation)  
 Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy  
 Clinically significant in the Investigator’s judgment  
It is the Investig ator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings .  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should 
be classified as an AE.

also Section 7.4.4  for detail s regarding the DSMB.  
7.4.9 Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire  
The questionnaire “Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire” (see Appendix 2 [Section  13.2]) should 
be used as a source document .  The questionnaire will be completed at Visits 1 ( OLE 
Baseline /Week  24), 4 (Week 36) , 6 (Week 52) , 8 (Week 76) , 10 (EoT/Week 106) , and SFU-2 
(Week  112) as noted in Table  1. 
If question No. 1 (Does the subject have a new diagnosis of active TB  disease ) of the TB risk 
questionnaire is answered with “Yes” at Visit 1  (OLE Baseline/Week 24) , the subject is not 
allowed to enter the study (see exclusion criterion No. 2, Section 5.3.2 ).  A “Yes” response to 
any of the other questions within the questionnaire at Screening should trigger further careful 
assessment to determine the subject’s risk of TB disease . 
At any visit after Visit 1  (OLE Baseline/Week 24), a “Yes” response should be treated as 
follows:  
 Question 1:  If a subject answers “Yes” study treatment should be discontinued if 
active TB is confirmed (see Section  6.11). 
 Questions 2 through 6:  If a subject answers “Yes” to any question, they should be 
assessed (TB risk questionnaire and physical examination) [ADDRESS_928114], if needed.  
 Questions 7 through 12:  If a subject answers “Yes” to any question, this should 
trigger a careful assessment to determine if the subj ect developed TB 
(see Section  7.4.10 ). 
This risk questionnaire is not to be used to exclude TB disease or confirm diagnosis.  
7.4.10  Management of T uberculo sis 
Subjects that develop evidence of latent or active TB once enrolled in the study (and 
receiving study treatment ) must immediately discontinue further administration of study 
treatment, and  the subject  should be examined by [CONTACT_684859] (as acceptable per local practice).  
If active is confirmed, the subject must permanently discontinue study treatment  (see 
Section  6.11).  Confirmed active TB is an SAE that must be recorded on the relevant pages

If latent TB is confirmed, the subject may resume the administration of study treatment if 
active TB is ruled out by a certified TB specialist or pulmonologist who is familiar with 
diagnosing and treating TB (as acceptable per local practice), the subject starts prophylactic 
treatment of LTBI  according to country -specific/CDC guidelines (see App endix 4  
[Section  13.4]), and the subject  agree s to complete the entire course of recommended LTBI  
therapy.  Study treatment should not be administered until active  TB is ruled out , the subject 
starts prophylactic LTBI therapy , and the Investigator receives confirmation from the 
Medical Monitor if the subject deviated from the allowed injection window .  Confirmed 
latent TB should be recorded as an AE on the relevant pages of the eCRF.  Details regarding

Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both ( e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or  flushing, swollen 
lips-tongue -uvula)  AND AT LEAST 1 OF THE FOLLOWING  
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hypoxemia)  
b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_335501] r exposure to a likely allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):  
a. Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue -uvula)  
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduce d 
PEF, hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)  
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to se veral hours):  
a. Infants and children:  low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease 
in systolic BPa 
b. Adults:  systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that 
person’s baseline  
Abbreviations :  BP = blood pressure ; PEF =  peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229].  
a.  Low systolic BP for children is defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70  mm Hg + [2× age]) 
from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.

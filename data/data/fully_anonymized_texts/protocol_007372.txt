Background and Significance  Digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393830]-time verification of medication ingestion events and can be used to monitor medication adherence; previous studies have demonstrated their acceptability in real-world patient populations.1-[ADDRESS_494229] demonstrated pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with once daily Truvada is efficacious in preventing HIV infection, protection is highly dependent on adherence. There is a clear dose response relationship between PrEP adherence and prevention of HIV transmission.[ADDRESS_494230]-hoc analyses of the iPrEX data (corroborated by [CONTACT_393901]) found that individuals whose drug levels were consistent with taking 4 or more doses of TDF/FTC (e.g., Truvada) a week had a greater than 90% level of protection from HIV; but only 50% of MSM in iPrEX achieved consistent adherence.2,4-6 Substance use, especially stimulant use, among MSM occurs syndemically in the context of other mental health vulnerabilities (most notably depression, sexual trauma, and intimate partner violence7 that increase their risk for condomless anal sex and HIV infection. Similarly, among HIV-infected MSM, the impact of substance use on ART adherence and HIV treatment outcomes is also well established8,[ADDRESS_494231] already identified substance use as a significant barrier to optimal PrEP adherence among MSM.10,11  In this study, we plan to develop and deploy a novel smartphone based intervention, PrEPsteps. PrEPsteps, a smartphone-based intervention that addresses real-time PrEP nonadherence among MSM with non-alcohol substance use (MSM+S). PrEPsteps is a brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy intervention to improve PrEP adherence among MSM+S. It is comprises an established, empi[INVESTIGATOR_393831] (LifeSteps12-14) augmented for this population by [CONTACT_1116] A) app-delivered booster sessions; B) contingent reinforcement/corrective feedback15-17; and C) evidence based Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) addressing non-alcohol substance use.18,19 Innovatively, PrEPsteps responds to objective, real-time PrEP adherence data obtained from a digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393832]/FTC ingestion. I will conduct focus groups among HIV negative MSM+S to inform the specification, presentation and design of PrEPsteps, and test the usability and sustainability of PrEPsteps and the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393833] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (N=60) of MSM+S using PrEP. Finally, we will conduct qualitative interviews to assess the response to PrEPsteps and digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393834].

Specific Aims  Aim 1: To inform the specification of the PrEPsteps adherence intervention with participant-generated content solicited through five focus groups. We will solicit feedback from the focus group participants on all the components of the PrEPsteps intervention delivery content and platform.   Aim 2: To test, through a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (N=30x2), the feasibility, acceptability and potential for an effect of PrEPsteps on PrEP adherence, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in HIV seronegative MSM with non-alcohol substance use who are initiating or continuing PrEP.   Aim 3: To assess the acceptability of the PrEPsteps intervention components (and the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) through qualitative exit interviews with those randomized to the PrEPsteps condition.   III. Recruitment  Eligible participants are HIV-negative cis-gender MSM who have non-alcohol substance use (identified in medical record) and are currently taking PrEP. We will use recruitment techniques previously employed in Fenway studies, including venue outreach (bar, club, cruising areas), community outreach, word of mouth from past or present participants in FCH studies, and advertising (print, clinic flyers and electronic media). Potential participants will also be screened during clinical appointments at Fenway Health by [CONTACT_464]. New patients at Fenway Health are given a Notice of Privacy Practices which informs them that their protected health information may be utilized for research when the research proposal is IRB-approved and conducted in accordance with HIPAA privacy and confidentiality rules. Further, under HIPAA, as employees of the covered entity (Fenway Health), the study staff may utilize medical records to identify potential participants. Potentially eligible patients will be identified using electronic reports from the data team. A study staff member will then work with medical assistants and/or providers before approaching patients to assess interest. After entering the room and prior to screening, the study staff member will explain the study before asking permission to complete the screening questionnaire. Those who appear to be eligible will be invited to participate in the study after their appointment, or set up an appointment in the future.   During periods of remote work (i.e., when in-person recruitment on Fenway Health medical floors is not feasible due to COVID-19-related restrictions), we will additionally run a Tableau report (after securing a HIPAA waiver from Fenway Health IRB), to identify patients who meet basic eligibility criteria. For patients that meet initial eligibility criteria, we will reach out via phone and/or patient portal to those who gave permission to be contact[CONTACT_393902]. For individuals who have not yet opted-in, we will reach out to their provider for permission to contact [CONTACT_476]. If a provider does not respond to emails, we will attempt to call them or connect with their support staff via email or phone. We will document patients’ permission or providers’ permission to contact [CONTACT_393903] a password-protected file, which will be saved on Dropbox. Upon receiving permission from providers to contact [CONTACT_393904], we will reach out to patients via the patient portal. The initial message will not contain any sensitive information (e.g. mention of PrEP status, HIV status, etc.), and will use the subject line, “Paid Research Study Opportunity.” We will respond to general questions about the study (e.g., related to eligibility criteria) directly in the patient portal for the patient’s convenience; however, we will not respond to non-study-related questions and will ask participants to contact [CONTACT_393905]. The portal message will allow patients the option of opting out of future communications from the PrEPsteps study team. If a patient opts out, we will not contact

If a patient does not opt out within 7 days, we will reach out either via phone or via email with a provider letter. We will abide by [CONTACT_1962]’ stated contact [CONTACT_66178]. The provider letter sent via email will not include any sensitive information, and will use the subject line, “Paid Research Study Opportunity.” After [ADDRESS_494232] permission to be contact[CONTACT_7678], and elected to provide their email address, cell phone number, and/or zip code. The recruitment database is saved as a password-protected Excel file on Dropbox, which the study staff will access to recruit potential participants for PrEPsteps. The staff will contact [CONTACT_393907] a zip code located in or near [LOCATION_011], MA either via phone or via email. We will abide by [CONTACT_42148]’ stated contact [CONTACT_66178].   Our recruitment efforts, in line with our previous recruitment initiatives, will include targeted recruitment of men of color, by [CONTACT_393908], and conducting recruitment drives in minority communities. Initially, a potential participant will contact [CONTACT_464], express interest in the study, and provide the staff person with their name [CONTACT_393936]. Also, staff will use a study screener on Fenway medical floors that cover inclusion criteria for PrEPsteps (as well as a screener for an investigation recruiting a similar study population, the IMPACT study). The staff will briefly describe the study requirements and procedures for IMPACT and PrEPsteps, and if the prospective participant is interested, an eligibility screening will be conducted for both studies. This recruitment method has been utilized by [CONTACT_393909]. Contact [CONTACT_393910], and are interested in enrolling in PrEPsteps, will be stored in a password-protected spreadsheet on a shared folder in the Fenway server accessible only to members of the PrEPsteps study team.  We will advertise aim 2 of the study on social media (e.g., Grindr, Growlr, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Craigslist) in coordination with the recruitment team at the Fenway Institute. We will also receive referrals for potentially eligible participants through the use of a centralized pre-screener facilitated by [CONTACT_393911]. Finally, BIDMC will be used as a site for passive recruitment, in which a PowerPoint slide advertising the study will be shared/presented at regular HIV conference meetings attended by [CONTACT_393912].

 Version 21.[ADDRESS_494233] Selection  Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria Aim 1: 1) Cis-gender MSM with problematic stimulant use (identified in medical record as stimulant dependence or recurrent stimulant use that interferes with daily life: ICD 304, 305 and 292) or self-report (e.g. reported stimulant use in the past 6 months) 2) HIV-negative 3) On PrEP or qualifies for PrEP 4) Age 18 or older Aim 1: Does not speak English  Aim 2: 1) Cis-gender MSM with moderate to severe non-alcohol substance use disorder (via MINI assessment) 2) HIV-negative 3) On PrEP or initiating PrEP 4) Has qualifying laboratory testing: Cr clearance, HBV, liver function tests 5) Owns a smartphone with Android or iOS 6) Age 18 or older Aim 2: 1) Does not speak English 2) HIV positive 3) History of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis 4) History of gastric by[CONTACT_6476], bowel stricture 5) History of GI malignancy or radiation to abdomen 6) Unable/unwilling to ingest digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] 7) Allergy to gelatin, silver or zinc (components of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) 8) Does not qualify for PrEP (abnormal liver function, or Cr Clearance <60) Aim 3: Participants in Aim 2 will be enrolled in Aim 3 Aim 3: Did not participate in Aim [ADDRESS_494234] risk group for new HIV infection nationally (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). We did not include women or heterosexual men in the current study because the intervention approach may vary in different communities.  Moreover, Fenway’s extensive experience working with MSM makes this site most appropriate for the development of an intervention that focuses on MSM.  This study proposes to recruit biological MSM. The decision not to recruit transgender men or women is based upon the following considerations. The priority for this treatment development study is to develop a treatment that will identify important relationships between non-alcohol substance use and PrEP nonadherence so that we can modify these experiences to improve adherence in this population. If we are successful in developi[INVESTIGATOR_393835], we will expand our study to explore if the intervention can be translated towards transgender individuals who may have different barriers to PrEP adherence.  Justification for Substance Use Disorder Among MSM enrolled in the iPrEX study, individuals who experience suboptimal and eventual nonadherence had concomitant substance use disorders. While the majority of MSM with PrEP nonadherence in iPrEX were stimulant users, substance use in general has been a predictor of PrEP nonadherence, especially after the end of

 Version 21.0                                                                                                                                         Page 5 of 22  a structured clinical trial (Hoenigl JAIDS 2019). Additionally, all substance use has been associated with increased incidence of sexually transmitted infections, suggesting that risky sexual activity occurs in the context of substance use (Hoenigl Emerg Infect Dis 2018). MSM who use substances also experience other concurrent risk factors for nonadherence including missed appointments and disengagement with care (Zucker JAIDS 2019). These concurrent risk factors for nonadherence are increasingly exaggerated in individuals with moderate to severe substance use disorder who have increasingly disorganized lives. The aim of this investigation is to develop the PrEPSteps intervention to address personalized barriers to adherence in these individuals for whom substance use disorder impacts their PrEP adherence.  Justification for Exclusion Criteria We are excluding individuals with bowel strictures, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, bowel neoplasm or radiation to the abdomen in order to minimize the risk of retention of digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393836]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_393837], potential participants that are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_393838].   V. Subject Enrollment  For all aims, we will publicize the study at Fenway Health primary care provider (PCP) meetings. We will additionally distribute flyers and palm cards at Fenway Health and at local sites including local bars and clubs in coordination with our recruitment team. For recruitment from the medical floors at Fenway, we will utilize CPS/Centricity to access the patient scheduler in conjunction with electronic reports (HIPAA waiver) in order to know if potential participants are scheduled for appointments at Fenway locations, their providers (so that we can approach them or nursing staff on the appropriate floor and time), and whether or not potential participants have confirmed their appointment or cancelled them. If Fenway PCPs have eligible participants we will ask the PCP if they are willing to refer them to us. We will also screen participants at scheduled Fenway Health appointments using electronic reports generated from the data team under our HIPAA waiver.   Participants who consent and are recruited for aim 1 and also meet eligibility criteria for aims 2/3 will be additionally approached regarding aims 2/[ADDRESS_494235] study visit.   Finally, we will also advertise on social media, and flyering through clubs and other venues in the Greater [LOCATION_011] area. We will also advertise through local electronic billboards in the greater [LOCATION_011] area.  VI. Study Procedures  Aim 1: In this aim, we will conduct a series of [ADDRESS_494236] participants complete a quantitative assessment (PrEPsteps_quantatitveassessment_v1). In the first two exploratory focus groups, we will discuss the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393839] a whole. We will explore themes of the interconnection between digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], adherence data, and interventions based on nonadherence. We will also explore the hardware relationships between digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
Detailed Protocol  Development of Ingestible Biosensors to Enhance PrEP Adherence in Substance Users (PrEPsteps)  
 Version 21.[ADDRESS_494237] five focus groups that will explore the structure of PrEPsteps. The focus groups will start with a general description of PrEPsteps. Next we will discuss each component of PrEPsteps: the LifeSteps framework, contingent reinforcement/corrective feedback (CR/CF) and SBIRT interventions. Iterative refinements to the structure of PrEPsteps, the wording of messages in CR/CF and content within SBIRT interventions. We will additionally inform the design features that improve the acceptability of each component of PrEPsteps: the timing of delivered interventions, how many messages are delivered daily, and the design and appropriate display of messages on the smartphone interface.   We will compi[INVESTIGATOR_393840], preparing participants for digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393841], the structure and delivery of PrEPsteps and content of PrEPsteps into a final product package of digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393842], smartphone app interface and interventions that comprise PrEPsteps. We will present this package to one final focus group (N=10) to ensure that all components are acceptable and understandable by [CONTACT_91301]. Once this final focus group is complete, we will program PrEPsteps with our industry partner, etectRx, into the smartphone app and conduct a series of pi[INVESTIGATOR_393843].  Aim 2 and 3: In Aims 2 and 3, we will deploy PrEPsteps in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_393844]-alcohol substance use who are on PrEP. This portion of the study will involve 7 study visits (most of them remote) over the course of [ADDRESS_494238] digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393845]. Details of the PrEPSteps intervention, delivery of intervention and all study visits are described below:   Intervention Condition (PrEPsteps): The PrEPSteps intervention integrates feedback from focus groups completed in aim 1 to specify the content of this intervention. At the core of PrEPSteps are text messages that are housed in the etectRx app that respond to adherence and nonadherence events detected by [CONTACT_393913][INVESTIGATOR_4382]. Daily messaging is triggered based on detection of adherence. There are three major parts to PrEPSteps:  1) Contingent reinforcement: These are neutral positive feedback messages (e.g. “ingestion detected”) that are delivered to the participant confirming that their digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393846]. These messages are delivered each time the participant ingests a digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393847]. 2) Corrective feedback: In the setting of detected nonadherence, participants will receive a message of corrective feedback, reminding participants that they did not take their PrEP. This message will be linked to the third component of PrEPSteps, a LifeSteps booster. 3) Life Steps booster sessions: As part of study visit 3, we will conduct an initial session of LifeSteps with the study participant. We will use this session to identify major perceived barriers to adherence and solutions to these barriers. We will focus specifically on substance use (Non-alcohol) as a potential barrier to adherence given our study population. These barriers and solutions are displayed in concert with corrective feedback messages after every nonadherence event detected by [CONTACT_393913][INVESTIGATOR_4382]. Participants are prompted to select the barrier that they may have encountered. They will also have the option to select “other,” which will generate a free text field to describe the barrier they faced. If they select one of the barriers they previously identified during LifeSteps in study visit 3, they will also receive their previously identified solution to that barrier.

Corrective feedback tied to Life Steps booster messages are delivered 1-2 hours after digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393849]’s self-defined dosing window (e.g., participant-identified regular PrEP ingestion time). For example, if a participant defines their dosing window as 9-11am, they will receive corrective feedback in the context of not taking their digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393850] 12pm-1pm.  See below for a figure of PrEPSteps algorithm:

Participants will be trained on the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_113572], operation of the reader and the accompanying app. For individuals in the control arm, they will receive confirmation messages surrounding digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_67131]. If participants want to see if they ingested a digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], they will be able to query this in the app. Participants will receive weekly adherence metrics (please see attached list of PrEPSteps messaging for both conditions).

If this visit is conducted entirely onsite, individuals will be roomed in the 8th floor consult rooms. We will conduct the informed consent process and answer questions about the study. If they consent, we will ask participants to sign the Fenway Institute Medical Release Form, Fenway Locator Form, and the Informed Consent Form. Once we verify consent is signed, we will ask participants to either show us their most recent screening lab work, or send results via secure email. If participants do not have qualifying lab work, or are initiating PrEP, we will draw labs specimens (Chem 7, Hepatitis B status, liver function tests). All lab tests will be processed by [CONTACT_393914]. Next, after the consent process, a trained member of the study team will walk the participant through the substance use screener (MINI 7.0 Substance Use Disorder Subscale) via Zoom. Once the substance use screener is complete, participants will complete the acute HIV screener (PrEPsteps_Screening Visit_Acute HIV Screener). If their responses indicate potential for acute HIV, they will receive HIV viral load testing or be referred to their PCP. We will also ask for permission to contact [CONTACT_2299]’s PCP via Mimecast secure email to inform them that the participant has enrolled in the study. All participants will then receive a 3rd generation rapid HIV test. If participants test positive, we will refer to them to Fenway Health for confirmatory testing. If participants do not wish to continue care at Fenway, we will refer them to the infectious disease clinic at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If participants are eligible, and have all qualifying laboratory work, we will contact [CONTACT_393915] 1.  In the event that the Screening Visit is conducted in a partially remote format, we will email participants the Fenway Institute Medical Release Form, Fenway Locator Form, and the Informed Consent Form prior to the virtual (Zoom) portion of the visit. We will conduct the informed consent process via Zoom and answer questions about the study. If they consent, we will ask participants to electronically sign all three of these forms while study staff remain on the Zoom line. Also during the virtual portion of this visit, we will review recent lab work, walk the participant through the substance use screener, and ask participants to complete the acute HIV screener. During the onsite portion of this visit, we will conduct the rapid HIV test, and any required lab work.    Study Visit 1: Procedures for this visit will be conducted onsite at Fenway Health, or partially remote, if necessary, in response to COVID-19. If this visit is conducted entirely onsite, participants will complete the baseline quantitative assessment (PrEPsteps_Quantative Assessment_Visit 1) via REDCap. We will show participants optional training videos on how to operate the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393851] (see PrEPsteps_etectRx Training Videos Link). We will then conduct a short training of operation of the components of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393852]. We will instruct participants on basic troubleshooting of the technology. We will also identify a 2-4 hour dosing window (e.g., period of time during which the participant usually takes their PrEP) and program this window into the online interface. This dosing window will be used to time the corrective feedback and LifeSteps booster components of PrEPSteps at Study Visit [ADDRESS_494239] digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393853] a study team member, to demonstrate their understanding of how to operate digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393854]. Finally, participants will electronically sign an acknowledgement of receipt of privacy practices from ARx Pharmacy (ARx_Receipt of Notice of Privacy Practices) via a link provided by [CONTACT_393916]. A copy of this receipt will be emailed to the study team and filed in the participant’s study file. Participants will be scheduled for a 2-week follow-up (Study Visit 2), and provided with 21 days of Truvada digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (14 pi[INVESTIGATOR_393855] 2-week period, plus 7 additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_393856] a buffer if scheduling issues arise). We will contact [CONTACT_393917] 2, 5, and 7 to ensure the technology is functioning.

We will also send participants optional training videos on how to operate the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393851] (see PrEPsteps_etectRx Training Videos Link). During the onsite portion of this visit, we will conduct all training on the use of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393852], and observe the participant ingest their first digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393857]. Participants will also sign the receipt of privacy practices from ARx Pharmacy during the onsite portion.   As part of the PrEPsteps supplement (3K23DA044874-05S1, funded in September 2022), additional questions were added to the baseline quantitative assessment at Study Visit 1 (PrEPsteps_Quantative Assessment_Visit 1). Participants who enrolled after the start of the supplement project completed the updated baseline quantitative assessment with the additional questions integrated. The study team will seek to contact [CONTACT_393918], and therefore did not complete the additional questions. If interested in completing the additional quantitative questions, participants may complete the PrEPsteps supplement baseline questions via REDCap, or over the phone with a study team member. If participants complete these questions verbally via phone, their answers will be recorded in REDCap by a study team member. Participants who elect to complete the additional questions will be remunerated.  Study Visit 2: Procedures for this visit will be conducted onsite at Fenway Health, or partially remote, if necessary, in response to COVID-19. This visit will take place [ADDRESS_494240] participants on day 7 to remind participants of their appointment. Participants will be randomized into the control arm (treatment as usual with digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393858]) or the intervention arm (PrEPsteps). Randomization will occur via a predetermined schema using REDCap. We will review the previous [ADDRESS_494241] the option of viewing the original digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393859] 1 as a refresher course for technology training if they desire. Participants will return any unused digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393860] 14-day period (to be counted by [CONTACT_464]), and will additionally undergo a blood draw for dried blood spot (DBS) testing for tenofovir diphosphate (to measure adherence and compare DBS against the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]). For all participants, a 30-day supply of Truvada digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393861]. We will contact [CONTACT_393919] 16, 19, [ADDRESS_494242] schema (i.e., reminder messages for study visit) will remain the same for each subsequent visit.  In the event that Study Visit 2 is conducted in a partially remote format, we will randomize the participant, review the previous 2 weeks of adherence data, and provide the link to the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393862] (Zoom) portion of this visit. All remaining study visit procedures will be conducted during the onsite portion of this visit.

Remuneration: Participants will be remunerated via ClinCards using the following schedule. Participants will only receive compensation for completed study visits. Participants who enrolled prior to the start of the PrEPsteps supplement in September 2022, and who elect to complete the additional questions added to the baseline quantitative assessment, will be compensated an additional $20.   Study Visit Compensation Screening Visit $20 Study Visit 1 $20 Study Visit 2 $30 Study Visit 3 $30 Study Visit 4 $30 Study Visit 5 $40 Study Visit 6 $50 Additional Supplement Questions (if applicable) $20 Total $[ADDRESS_494248]: We will contact [CONTACT_393921] (see PrEPSteps Study Messages_Participant Only). Additionally, if participants do not respond to text messages (e.g., technology check-ins at days 2, 5, 7, 16, 19, 21), we will contact [CONTACT_163170], and/or email. We will also contact [CONTACT_393922], Nomi text message, patient portal, and/or email. Upon participant request, we will inform them of the results of the urine drugs of abuse screen at study visits 3 and 5 via phone or in-person. As part of the PrEPsteps supplement, questions were added to the baseline quantitative assessment (PrEPsteps_Quantitative Assessment_Visit 1). The study team will contact [CONTACT_393923] 1 baseline quantitative assessment prior to the addition of the PrEPsteps supplement questions (in September 2022) to inquire about their interest in completing the additional supplement questions.   Standard Operating Procedures for Nonadherence: The digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393873]. Recognizing standard medical care does not include daily reminders around PrEP adherence, we have developed a standard operating procedure to surround nonadherence/non-detection of digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393874]. Communication surrounding nonadherence is detailed in a separate document (SOP_nonadherence).  Drug Procurement:  Digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393875] (our collaborating pharmacy). Once participants sign informed consent during the Screening Visit, and we have confirmed qualifying laboratory work and eligibility, we will fax a Patient Prescription and Enrollment Form to ARx. This order form will contain the following information, as required by [CONTACT_393924]: (1) participant’s name; (2) participant’s date of birth; (3) participant’s study ID number; (4) participant’s phone number; (5) participant’s mailing address; (6) participant’s drug allergies and current medications (if applicable); (7)

Following receipt of the Patient Prescription and Enrollment Form, ARx will mail 21 digital Truvada pi[INVESTIGATOR_393855] 14-day run in period (including 7 digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393876]). Upon determination that the participant is eligible to continue in the study, the study team will fax a second Patient Prescription and Enrollment Form to ARx (same order form as for initial run-in period). ARx will then mail 90 digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (three 30-day supplies) to the Fenway Pharmacy. Confirmation of all shipment receipt will be documented in the PrEPSteps Pharmacy SOP binder. At Study Visits 1, 2, and 3, we will complete a Prescription Card that study staff will bring to the Fenway Pharmacy, who will sign out drug to us. If participants no-show during their study visit, we will return and sign back in drug to the Fenway Pharmacy. Leftover drug (during study visits, or in the case of lost to follow up) will be kept at Fenway. Pharmacy labels will be scratched off and destroyed to protect participant privacy prior to return to our industry collaborators at a time to be determined.  Study Visit Scheduling:  We will schedule study visits as close to [ADDRESS_494249] completed the screening visits (Study Visits 1 and 2), we will continue to contact [CONTACT_393925] 3. We will review participants who are lost to follow up at this stage to determine if continued attempts to contact [CONTACT_393926]. All remote portions of study visits (via Zoom) will be scheduled as close in proximity as possible to the in-person portions of those visits.  Risk Assessments: A licensed clinician will be onsite during all study visits where the quantitative assessment component is completed in-person. If a participant answers “nearly every day” to question #9 on the PHQ9, indicating suicidality, this will trigger a safety evaluation by a licensed clinician (e.g., [CONTACT_393937]) before the participant is released. The clinician will review the results of the assessment with the participant, evaluate their safety and risk of harm, and make clinical referrals to Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278640]. In the unlikely event that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_393877], another licensed clinician will conduct the safety evaluation. The participant’s primary treating physician will be notified of the any clinical referrals made as a result of this evaluation.  VII. Biostatistical Analysis  Aim 1: We will conduct qualitative analysis on individual interviews in aim 1 to elucidate themes of technology acceptance, design, and optimal timing and delivery of messaging.   Aim 2: We will calculate descriptive statistics regarding the degree of adherence collected from the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. We will also calculate the accuracy of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393878]. We additionally will report overall percent adherence and measure the association between percent adherence and PrEPSteps. Additionally we will report weeks of adherence (>4 doses a week) and measure the association between weeks of adherence and the use of PrEPSteps. Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], proof-of-concept study, we will not be powered to determine the degree of adherence the use of a digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393879].  Aim 3: We will conduct an applied thematic analysis on all recorded interviews using NVivo 12.

 Version 21.[ADDRESS_494250] addressed each of these risks below: Exposure to Metal Components in Digital Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]: The Digital Pi[INVESTIGATOR_393880]. The radiofrequency tags contain minimal amounts of silver, zinc and magnesium that are significantly less than the recommended daily intake of these metals. In order to prevent absorption of these metals, the radiofrequency tag is coated with an epoxy and ethylcellulose coating in a technique that is used for other ingestible medical devices.20,21 Extensive experience in the use of ingestible small bowel endoscopy cameras has not reported adverse events related to the exposure of electronic components.22,23   Digital Pi[INVESTIGATOR_393881]: Study participants may experience retention of the radiofrequency emitting portion of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. A study assessing the efficacy of the capsule portion of PrEPsteps among healthy volunteers documented [ADDRESS_494251]. Chai has completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_393882] 96 ingestions with the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393883].2 Additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_393884] 100 participants who ingested radiofrequency tagged gelatin capsules revealed no reports of sensor retention (Personal communication from Joris VanDam, [COMPANY_001]). An additional investigation to determine the safety of digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393885].[ADDRESS_494252] comparison to the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393886]. Over a decade of experience of capsule endoscopy has revealed a capsule retention rate of less than 2%.22,[ADDRESS_494253] the capsule removed successfully underwent elective partial small bowel resection with pathologic findings including mild bowel stricture or intimal ulceration from capsule retention.25 Complication rates among patients with Crohn’s disease, bowel neoplasm, radiation enteritis, or stricture were higher.26,[ADDRESS_494254]. In order to minimize the risk of PrEPsteps capsule retention, we plan to exclude patients with underlying bowel disease or surgical intervention to the bowel.   Allergic Reaction: There is a risk of allergic reaction to the silver and zinc components of the radiofrequency transmitter, and to the gelatin pi[INVESTIGATOR_393887]. In order to minimize the risk of a potential allergic reaction, we plan to exclude patients with a known allergy to silver, zinc or gelatin.

We will take [ADDRESS_494255] participants from the risk of discoverability. • Password protection on participants’ cellphones: We will ensure that participants’ cellphones are enabled with password protection (or Touch ID, for iPhones). Participants will be the only individuals who have access to their personal cellphones. • Messaging that does not directly reveal PrEP ingestion: During focus groups in aim 1, we will craft messages from PrEPsteps that avoid inadvertent disclosure that participants are on PrEP to protect against individuals who are uninvolved in the study reading messages from PrEPsteps. Although messages are password protected, we will take the additional step of ensuring the text of messaging protects participants against PrEP discoverability. • Masking the icon of the PrEPsteps app to prevent discoverability: We will mask the icon of the PrEPsteps app as a generic “ID Cap” app to avoid discoverability of PrEP ingestion or participation in PrEPsteps. • Opaque digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393888]: The digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393889], prevent discoverability of PrEP ingestion by [CONTACT_393928]/FTC.  Psychological Discomfort of Disclosing Adherence Patterns: Participants may experience psychological discomfort in disclosing and learning of their adherence data during study visits.   IX. Potential Benefits  Participants may indirectly benefit from participation in the study by [CONTACT_393929]. Interacting and using PrEPsteps may confer some increased adherence among study participants.   X. Data Transmission from Digital Pi[INVESTIGATOR_393890]. There is no medication data that identifies study drug as Truvada, nor personal identifiers within the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393851]. Ingestion of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393891] a generic radiofrequency signal that is collected by [CONTACT_87413]. The Reader then transmits ingestion data via low energy Bluetooth to the participant’s cellular phone. This data is collected by [CONTACT_393930]’s smartphone. Within the app, data is converted to Java Script notation that describes the presence of an ingested medication. This data is transferred to servers at our collaborating industry partner, etectRx. This data is then stored on a secure server. Access is limited to etectRx maintenance technicians and the study team. For PrEPSteps interventions and text messages, receipt of digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393892]- this dashboard automates the PrEPSteps intervention and pushes messages via SMS text messaging to the participant’s phone in response to their ingestion patterns. Study participants are identified on the etectRx and NOMI dashboard only as study numbers. Their PHI is kept within secure Fenway computers. A secure excel spreadsheet that links study numbers to participant names is kept on desktop computers at Fenway accessible to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  XI. Data Monitoring and Quality Assurance

At each study visit, participants will undergo pi[INVESTIGATOR_393893], and calculate the accuracy of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393894]. Any discrepancies between the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393895]. For each participant, we will also review signaling from the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393896] (etectRx) to ensure there are no errors in data transmission contribution to missed adherence events. If errors occur as a result of data transmission, we will correct the participant’s adherence data, and convey these changes to participants’ PCP via Mimecast secure email. We will additionally obtain dried blood spot testing at study visits 3 and 4 to confirm adherence (see section V. study procedures)  Recorded interviews: Audio-recorded interviews (Aim 1 and 3) will be transcribed using a HIPAA compliant transcription service (Landmark transcription), and scrubbed of identifiers  Aim 2 QA review: Study investigators will conduct QA review of baseline adherence data after the first [ADDRESS_494256] (DSMB): Three investigators who are external to the study and external to [CONTACT_393938]’s mentoring team as defined by [CONTACT_393931] K23 award with expertise in PrEP, non-alcohol substance use disorder, technology security and behavioral interventions, will comprise a DSMB for Aim 2 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269]) of the research plan. The DSMB will convene annually during Aim 2. Additionally, the DSMB will meet when N=30 study participants are enrolled in Aim 2. They will review the data, and any potential study related adverse events prior to approving the continuation of recruitment. The responsibilities of the DSMB will include:  • Reviewing the research protocol, consent form, and plans for DSMB. • Evaluating the progress of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269]: recruitment, retention, data quality, site performance, adverse events. • Protection of participant safety • Making recommendations to [CONTACT_393938] and the Fenway Institute IRB regarding continuation, termination or modification of the study depending on benefits or adverse events. • Ensuring the confidentiality of study data. • Reviewing adverse events. • Providing annual written reports to [CONTACT_393938], and NIH regarding safety concerns, continuation or modification of the research plan.  We will additionally comply with all Fenway regulations regarding reporting of adverse events and ensuring data quality.  Data Tracking: Ingestion data will be automatically logged into the web interface hosted by [CONTACT_393932] a date/time stamp to ensure accurate record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_393897]. All data will be securely accessed at Fenway Health.

Background and Significance  Digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393830]-time verification of medication ingestion events and can be used to monitor medication adherence; previous studies have demonstrated their acceptability in real-world patient populations.1-[ADDRESS_494259] demonstrated pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with once daily Truvada is efficacious in preventing HIV infection, protection is highly dependent on adherence. There is a clear dose response relationship between PrEP adherence and prevention of HIV transmission.[ADDRESS_494260]-hoc analyses of the iPrEX data (corroborated by [CONTACT_393901]) found that individuals whose drug levels were consistent with taking 4 or more doses of TDF/FTC (e.g., Truvada) a week had a greater than 90% level of protection from HIV; but only 50% of MSM in iPrEX achieved consistent adherence.2,4-6 Substance use, especially stimulant use, among MSM occurs syndemically in the context of other mental health vulnerabilities (most notably depression, sexual trauma, and intimate partner violence7 that increase their risk for condomless anal sex and HIV infection. Similarly, among HIV-infected MSM, the impact of substance use on ART adherence and HIV treatment outcomes is also well established8,[ADDRESS_494261] already identified substance use as a significant barrier to optimal PrEP adherence among MSM.10,11  In this study, we plan to develop and deploy a novel smartphone based intervention, PrEPsteps. PrEPsteps, a smartphone-based intervention that addresses real-time PrEP nonadherence among MSM with non-alcohol substance use (MSM+S). PrEPsteps is a brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy intervention to improve PrEP adherence among MSM+S. It is comprises an established, empi[INVESTIGATOR_393831] (LifeSteps12-14) augmented for this population by [CONTACT_1116] A) app-delivered booster sessions; B) contingent reinforcement/corrective feedback15-17; and C) evidence based Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) addressing non-alcohol substance use.18,19 Innovatively, PrEPsteps responds to objective, real-time PrEP adherence data obtained from a digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393832]/FTC ingestion. I will conduct focus groups among HIV negative MSM+S to inform the specification, presentation and design of PrEPsteps, and test the usability and sustainability of PrEPsteps and the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393833] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (N=60) of MSM+S using PrEP. Finally, we will conduct qualitative interviews to assess the response to PrEPsteps and digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393834].

Specific Aims  Aim 1: To inform the specification of the PrEPsteps adherence intervention with participant-generated content solicited through five focus groups. We will solicit feedback from the focus group participants on all the components of the PrEPsteps intervention delivery content and platform.   Aim 2: To test, through a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (N=30x2), the feasibility, acceptability and potential for an effect of PrEPsteps on PrEP adherence, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in HIV seronegative MSM with non-alcohol substance use who are initiating or continuing PrEP.   Aim 3: To assess the acceptability of the PrEPsteps intervention components (and the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) through qualitative exit interviews with those randomized to the PrEPsteps condition.   III. Recruitment  Eligible participants are HIV-negative cis-gender MSM who have non-alcohol substance use (identified in medical record) and are currently taking PrEP. We will use recruitment techniques previously employed in Fenway studies, including venue outreach (bar, club, cruising areas), community outreach, word of mouth from past or present participants in FCH studies, and advertising (print, clinic flyers and electronic media). Potential participants will also be screened during clinical appointments at Fenway Health by [CONTACT_464]. New patients at Fenway Health are given a Notice of Privacy Practices which informs them that their protected health information may be utilized for research when the research proposal is IRB-approved and conducted in accordance with HIPAA privacy and confidentiality rules. Further, under HIPAA, as employees of the covered entity (Fenway Health), the study staff may utilize medical records to identify potential participants. Potentially eligible patients will be identified using electronic reports from the data team. A study staff member will then work with medical assistants and/or providers before approaching patients to assess interest. After entering the room and prior to screening, the study staff member will explain the study before asking permission to complete the screening questionnaire. Those who appear to be eligible will be invited to participate in the study after their appointment, or set up an appointment in the future.   During periods of remote work (i.e., when in-person recruitment on Fenway Health medical floors is not feasible due to COVID-19-related restrictions), we will additionally run a Tableau report (after securing a HIPAA waiver from Fenway Health IRB), to identify patients who meet basic eligibility criteria. For patients that meet initial eligibility criteria, we will reach out via phone and/or patient portal to those who gave permission to be contact[CONTACT_393902]. For individuals who have not yet opted-in, we will reach out to their provider for permission to contact [CONTACT_476]. If a provider does not respond to emails, we will attempt to call them or connect with their support staff via email or phone. We will document patients’ permission or providers’ permission to contact [CONTACT_393903] a password-protected file, which will be saved on Dropbox. Upon receiving permission from providers to contact [CONTACT_393904], we will reach out to patients via the patient portal. The initial message will not contain any sensitive information (e.g. mention of PrEP status, HIV status, etc.), and will use the subject line, “Paid Research Study Opportunity.” We will respond to general questions about the study (e.g., related to eligibility criteria) directly in the patient portal for the patient’s convenience; however, we will not respond to non-study-related questions and will ask participants to contact [CONTACT_393905]. The portal message will allow patients the option of opting out of future communications from the PrEPsteps study team. If a patient opts out, we will not contact

If a patient does not opt out within 7 days, we will reach out either via phone or via email with a provider letter. We will abide by [CONTACT_1962]’ stated contact [CONTACT_66178]. The provider letter sent via email will not include any sensitive information, and will use the subject line, “Paid Research Study Opportunity.” After [ADDRESS_494262] permission to be contact[CONTACT_7678], and elected to provide their email address, cell phone number, and/or zip code. The recruitment database is saved as a password-protected Excel file on Dropbox, which the study staff will access to recruit potential participants for PrEPsteps. The staff will contact [CONTACT_393907] a zip code located in or near [LOCATION_011], MA either via phone or via email. We will abide by [CONTACT_42148]’ stated contact [CONTACT_66178].   Our recruitment efforts, in line with our previous recruitment initiatives, will include targeted recruitment of men of color, by [CONTACT_393908], and conducting recruitment drives in minority communities. Initially, a potential participant will contact [CONTACT_464], express interest in the study, and provide the staff person with their name [CONTACT_393936]. Also, staff will use a study screener on Fenway medical floors that cover inclusion criteria for PrEPsteps (as well as a screener for an investigation recruiting a similar study population, the IMPACT study). The staff will briefly describe the study requirements and procedures for IMPACT and PrEPsteps, and if the prospective participant is interested, an eligibility screening will be conducted for both studies. This recruitment method has been utilized by [CONTACT_393909]. Contact [CONTACT_393910], and are interested in enrolling in PrEPsteps, will be stored in a password-protected spreadsheet on a shared folder in the Fenway server accessible only to members of the PrEPsteps study team.  We will advertise aim 2 of the study on social media (e.g., Grindr, Growlr, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Craigslist) in coordination with the recruitment team at the Fenway Institute. We will also receive referrals for potentially eligible participants through the use of a centralized pre-screener facilitated by [CONTACT_393911]. Finally, BIDMC will be used as a site for passive recruitment, in which a PowerPoint slide advertising the study will be shared/presented at regular HIV conference meetings attended by [CONTACT_393912].

 Version 21.[ADDRESS_494263] Selection  Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria Aim 1: 1) Cis-gender MSM with problematic stimulant use (identified in medical record as stimulant dependence or recurrent stimulant use that interferes with daily life: ICD 304, 305 and 292) or self-report (e.g. reported stimulant use in the past 6 months) 2) HIV-negative 3) On PrEP or qualifies for PrEP 4) Age 18 or older Aim 1: Does not speak English  Aim 2: 1) Cis-gender MSM with moderate to severe non-alcohol substance use disorder (via MINI assessment) 2) HIV-negative 3) On PrEP or initiating PrEP 4) Has qualifying laboratory testing: Cr clearance, HBV, liver function tests 5) Owns a smartphone with Android or iOS 6) Age 18 or older Aim 2: 1) Does not speak English 2) HIV positive 3) History of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis 4) History of gastric by[CONTACT_6476], bowel stricture 5) History of GI malignancy or radiation to abdomen 6) Unable/unwilling to ingest digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] 7) Allergy to gelatin, silver or zinc (components of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) 8) Does not qualify for PrEP (abnormal liver function, or Cr Clearance <60) Aim 3: Participants in Aim 2 will be enrolled in Aim 3 Aim 3: Did not participate in Aim [ADDRESS_494264] risk group for new HIV infection nationally (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). We did not include women or heterosexual men in the current study because the intervention approach may vary in different communities.  Moreover, Fenway’s extensive experience working with MSM makes this site most appropriate for the development of an intervention that focuses on MSM.  This study proposes to recruit biological MSM. The decision not to recruit transgender men or women is based upon the following considerations. The priority for this treatment development study is to develop a treatment that will identify important relationships between non-alcohol substance use and PrEP nonadherence so that we can modify these experiences to improve adherence in this population. If we are successful in developi[INVESTIGATOR_393835], we will expand our study to explore if the intervention can be translated towards transgender individuals who may have different barriers to PrEP adherence.  Justification for Substance Use Disorder Among MSM enrolled in the iPrEX study, individuals who experience suboptimal and eventual nonadherence had concomitant substance use disorders. While the majority of MSM with PrEP nonadherence in iPrEX were stimulant users, substance use in general has been a predictor of PrEP nonadherence, especially after the end of

Additionally, all substance use has been associated with increased incidence of sexually transmitted infections, suggesting that risky sexual activity occurs in the context of substance use (Hoenigl Emerg Infect Dis 2018). MSM who use substances also experience other concurrent risk factors for nonadherence including missed appointments and disengagement with care (Zucker JAIDS 2019). These concurrent risk factors for nonadherence are increasingly exaggerated in individuals with moderate to severe substance use disorder who have increasingly disorganized lives. The aim of this investigation is to develop the PrEPSteps intervention to address personalized barriers to adherence in these individuals for whom substance use disorder impacts their PrEP adherence.  Justification for Exclusion Criteria We are excluding individuals with bowel strictures, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, bowel neoplasm or radiation to the abdomen in order to minimize the risk of retention of digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393836]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_393837], potential participants that are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_393838].   V. Subject Enrollment  For all aims, we will publicize the study at Fenway Health primary care provider (PCP) meetings. We will additionally distribute flyers and palm cards at Fenway Health and at local sites including local bars and clubs in coordination with our recruitment team. For recruitment from the medical floors at Fenway, we will utilize CPS/Centricity to access the patient scheduler in conjunction with electronic reports (HIPAA waiver) in order to know if potential participants are scheduled for appointments at Fenway locations, their providers (so that we can approach them or nursing staff on the appropriate floor and time), and whether or not potential participants have confirmed their appointment or cancelled them. If Fenway PCPs have eligible participants we will ask the PCP if they are willing to refer them to us. We will also screen participants at scheduled Fenway Health appointments using electronic reports generated from the data team under our HIPAA waiver.   Participants who consent and are recruited for aim 1 and also meet eligibility criteria for aims 2/3 will be additionally approached regarding aims 2/[ADDRESS_494265] study visit.   Finally, we will also advertise on social media, and flyering through clubs and other venues in the Greater [LOCATION_011] area. We will also advertise through local electronic billboards in the greater [LOCATION_011] area.  VI. Study Procedures  Aim 1: In this aim, we will conduct a series of [ADDRESS_494266] participants complete a quantitative assessment (PrEPsteps_quantatitveassessment_v1). In the first two exploratory focus groups, we will discuss the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393839] a whole. We will explore themes of the interconnection between digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], adherence data, and interventions based on nonadherence. We will also explore the hardware relationships between digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
Detailed Protocol  Development of Ingestible Biosensors to Enhance PrEP Adherence in Substance Users (PrEPsteps)  
 Version 21.[ADDRESS_494267] five focus groups that will explore the structure of PrEPsteps. The focus groups will start with a general description of PrEPsteps. Next we will discuss each component of PrEPsteps: the LifeSteps framework, contingent reinforcement/corrective feedback (CR/CF) and SBIRT interventions. Iterative refinements to the structure of PrEPsteps, the wording of messages in CR/CF and content within SBIRT interventions. We will additionally inform the design features that improve the acceptability of each component of PrEPsteps: the timing of delivered interventions, how many messages are delivered daily, and the design and appropriate display of messages on the smartphone interface.   We will compi[INVESTIGATOR_393840], preparing participants for digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393841], the structure and delivery of PrEPsteps and content of PrEPsteps into a final product package of digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393842], smartphone app interface and interventions that comprise PrEPsteps. We will present this package to one final focus group (N=10) to ensure that all components are acceptable and understandable by [CONTACT_91301]. Once this final focus group is complete, we will program PrEPsteps with our industry partner, etectRx, into the smartphone app and conduct a series of pi[INVESTIGATOR_393843].  Aim 2 and 3: In Aims 2 and 3, we will deploy PrEPsteps in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_393844]-alcohol substance use who are on PrEP. This portion of the study will involve 7 study visits (most of them remote) over the course of [ADDRESS_494268] digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393845]. Details of the PrEPSteps intervention, delivery of intervention and all study visits are described below:   Intervention Condition (PrEPsteps): The PrEPSteps intervention integrates feedback from focus groups completed in aim 1 to specify the content of this intervention. At the core of PrEPSteps are text messages that are housed in the etectRx app that respond to adherence and nonadherence events detected by [CONTACT_393913][INVESTIGATOR_4382]. Daily messaging is triggered based on detection of adherence. There are three major parts to PrEPSteps:  1) Contingent reinforcement: These are neutral positive feedback messages (e.g. “ingestion detected”) that are delivered to the participant confirming that their digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393846]. These messages are delivered each time the participant ingests a digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393847]. 2) Corrective feedback: In the setting of detected nonadherence, participants will receive a message of corrective feedback, reminding participants that they did not take their PrEP. This message will be linked to the third component of PrEPSteps, a LifeSteps booster. 3) Life Steps booster sessions: As part of study visit 3, we will conduct an initial session of LifeSteps with the study participant. We will use this session to identify major perceived barriers to adherence and solutions to these barriers. We will focus specifically on substance use (Non-alcohol) as a potential barrier to adherence given our study population. These barriers and solutions are displayed in concert with corrective feedback messages after every nonadherence event detected by [CONTACT_393913][INVESTIGATOR_4382]. Participants are prompted to select the barrier that they may have encountered. They will also have the option to select “other,” which will generate a free text field to describe the barrier they faced. If they select one of the barriers they previously identified during LifeSteps in study visit 3, they will also receive their previously identified solution to that barrier.

Corrective feedback tied to Life Steps booster messages are delivered 1-2 hours after digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393849]’s self-defined dosing window (e.g., participant-identified regular PrEP ingestion time). For example, if a participant defines their dosing window as 9-11am, they will receive corrective feedback in the context of not taking their digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393850] 12pm-1pm.  See below for a figure of PrEPSteps algorithm:

Participants will be trained on the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_113572], operation of the reader and the accompanying app. For individuals in the control arm, they will receive confirmation messages surrounding digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_67131]. If participants want to see if they ingested a digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], they will be able to query this in the app. Participants will receive weekly adherence metrics (please see attached list of PrEPSteps messaging for both conditions).

If this visit is conducted entirely onsite, individuals will be roomed in the 8th floor consult rooms. We will conduct the informed consent process and answer questions about the study. If they consent, we will ask participants to sign the Fenway Institute Medical Release Form, Fenway Locator Form, and the Informed Consent Form. Once we verify consent is signed, we will ask participants to either show us their most recent screening lab work, or send results via secure email. If participants do not have qualifying lab work, or are initiating PrEP, we will draw labs specimens (Chem 7, Hepatitis B status, liver function tests). All lab tests will be processed by [CONTACT_393914]. Next, after the consent process, a trained member of the study team will walk the participant through the substance use screener (MINI 7.0 Substance Use Disorder Subscale) via Zoom. Once the substance use screener is complete, participants will complete the acute HIV screener (PrEPsteps_Screening Visit_Acute HIV Screener). If their responses indicate potential for acute HIV, they will receive HIV viral load testing or be referred to their PCP. We will also ask for permission to contact [CONTACT_2299]’s PCP via Mimecast secure email to inform them that the participant has enrolled in the study. All participants will then receive a 3rd generation rapid HIV test. If participants test positive, we will refer to them to Fenway Health for confirmatory testing. If participants do not wish to continue care at Fenway, we will refer them to the infectious disease clinic at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If participants are eligible, and have all qualifying laboratory work, we will contact [CONTACT_393915] 1.  In the event that the Screening Visit is conducted in a partially remote format, we will email participants the Fenway Institute Medical Release Form, Fenway Locator Form, and the Informed Consent Form prior to the virtual (Zoom) portion of the visit. We will conduct the informed consent process via Zoom and answer questions about the study. If they consent, we will ask participants to electronically sign all three of these forms while study staff remain on the Zoom line. Also during the virtual portion of this visit, we will review recent lab work, walk the participant through the substance use screener, and ask participants to complete the acute HIV screener. During the onsite portion of this visit, we will conduct the rapid HIV test, and any required lab work.    Study Visit 1: Procedures for this visit will be conducted onsite at Fenway Health, or partially remote, if necessary, in response to COVID-19. If this visit is conducted entirely onsite, participants will complete the baseline quantitative assessment (PrEPsteps_Quantative Assessment_Visit 1) via REDCap. We will show participants optional training videos on how to operate the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393851] (see PrEPsteps_etectRx Training Videos Link). We will then conduct a short training of operation of the components of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393852]. We will instruct participants on basic troubleshooting of the technology. We will also identify a 2-4 hour dosing window (e.g., period of time during which the participant usually takes their PrEP) and program this window into the online interface. This dosing window will be used to time the corrective feedback and LifeSteps booster components of PrEPSteps at Study Visit [ADDRESS_494269] digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393853] a study team member, to demonstrate their understanding of how to operate digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393854].

Remuneration: Participants will be remunerated via ClinCards using the following schedule. Participants will only receive compensation for completed study visits. Participants who enrolled prior to the start of the PrEPsteps supplement in September 2022, and who elect to complete the additional questions added to the baseline quantitative assessment, will be compensated an additional $20.

Additionally, if participants do not respond to text messages (e.g., technology check-ins at days 2, 5, 7, 16, 19, 21), we will contact [CONTACT_163170], and/or email. We will also contact [CONTACT_393922], Nomi text message, patient portal, and/or email. Upon participant request, we will inform them of the results of the urine drugs of abuse screen at study visits 3 and 5 via phone or in-person. As part of the PrEPsteps supplement, questions were added to the baseline quantitative assessment (PrEPsteps_Quantitative Assessment_Visit 1). The study team will contact [CONTACT_393923] 1 baseline quantitative assessment prior to the addition of the PrEPsteps supplement questions (in September 2022) to inquire about their interest in completing the additional supplement questions.   Standard Operating Procedures for Nonadherence: The digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393873]. Recognizing standard medical care does not include daily reminders around PrEP adherence, we have developed a standard operating procedure to surround nonadherence/non-detection of digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393874]. Communication surrounding nonadherence is detailed in a separate document (SOP_nonadherence).  Drug Procurement:  Digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393875] (our collaborating pharmacy). Once participants sign informed consent during the Screening Visit, and we have confirmed qualifying laboratory work and eligibility, we will fax a Patient Prescription and Enrollment Form to ARx. This order form will contain the following information, as required by [CONTACT_393924]: (1) participant’s name; (2) participant’s date of birth; (3) participant’s study ID number; (4) participant’s phone number; (5) participant’s mailing address; (6) participant’s drug allergies and current medications (if applicable); (7)

Following receipt of the Patient Prescription and Enrollment Form, ARx will mail 21 digital Truvada pi[INVESTIGATOR_393855] 14-day run in period (including 7 digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393876]). Upon determination that the participant is eligible to continue in the study, the study team will fax a second Patient Prescription and Enrollment Form to ARx (same order form as for initial run-in period). ARx will then mail 90 digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (three 30-day supplies) to the Fenway Pharmacy. Confirmation of all shipment receipt will be documented in the PrEPSteps Pharmacy SOP binder. At Study Visits 1, 2, and 3, we will complete a Prescription Card that study staff will bring to the Fenway Pharmacy, who will sign out drug to us. If participants no-show during their study visit, we will return and sign back in drug to the Fenway Pharmacy. Leftover drug (during study visits, or in the case of lost to follow up) will be kept at Fenway. Pharmacy labels will be scratched off and destroyed to protect participant privacy prior to return to our industry collaborators at a time to be determined.  Study Visit Scheduling:  We will schedule study visits as close to [ADDRESS_494279] completed the screening visits (Study Visits 1 and 2), we will continue to contact [CONTACT_393925] 3. We will review participants who are lost to follow up at this stage to determine if continued attempts to contact [CONTACT_393926]. All remote portions of study visits (via Zoom) will be scheduled as close in proximity as possible to the in-person portions of those visits.  Risk Assessments: A licensed clinician will be onsite during all study visits where the quantitative assessment component is completed in-person. If a participant answers “nearly every day” to question #9 on the PHQ9, indicating suicidality, this will trigger a safety evaluation by a licensed clinician (e.g., [CONTACT_393937]) before the participant is released. The clinician will review the results of the assessment with the participant, evaluate their safety and risk of harm, and make clinical referrals to Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278640]. In the unlikely event that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_393877], another licensed clinician will conduct the safety evaluation. The participant’s primary treating physician will be notified of the any clinical referrals made as a result of this evaluation.  VII. Biostatistical Analysis  Aim 1: We will conduct qualitative analysis on individual interviews in aim 1 to elucidate themes of technology acceptance, design, and optimal timing and delivery of messaging.   Aim 2: We will calculate descriptive statistics regarding the degree of adherence collected from the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. We will also calculate the accuracy of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393878]. We additionally will report overall percent adherence and measure the association between percent adherence and PrEPSteps. Additionally we will report weeks of adherence (>4 doses a week) and measure the association between weeks of adherence and the use of PrEPSteps. Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], proof-of-concept study, we will not be powered to determine the degree of adherence the use of a digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393879].  Aim 3: We will conduct an applied thematic analysis on all recorded interviews using NVivo 12.

 Version 21.[ADDRESS_494280] addressed each of these risks below: Exposure to Metal Components in Digital Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]: The Digital Pi[INVESTIGATOR_393880]. The radiofrequency tags contain minimal amounts of silver, zinc and magnesium that are significantly less than the recommended daily intake of these metals. In order to prevent absorption of these metals, the radiofrequency tag is coated with an epoxy and ethylcellulose coating in a technique that is used for other ingestible medical devices.20,21 Extensive experience in the use of ingestible small bowel endoscopy cameras has not reported adverse events related to the exposure of electronic components.22,23   Digital Pi[INVESTIGATOR_393881]: Study participants may experience retention of the radiofrequency emitting portion of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. A study assessing the efficacy of the capsule portion of PrEPsteps among healthy volunteers documented [ADDRESS_494281]. Chai has completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_393882] 96 ingestions with the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393883].2 Additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_393884] 100 participants who ingested radiofrequency tagged gelatin capsules revealed no reports of sensor retention (Personal communication from Joris VanDam, [COMPANY_001]). An additional investigation to determine the safety of digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393885].[ADDRESS_494282] comparison to the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393886]. Over a decade of experience of capsule endoscopy has revealed a capsule retention rate of less than 2%.22,[ADDRESS_494283] the capsule removed successfully underwent elective partial small bowel resection with pathologic findings including mild bowel stricture or intimal ulceration from capsule retention.25 Complication rates among patients with Crohn’s disease, bowel neoplasm, radiation enteritis, or stricture were higher.26,[ADDRESS_494284]. In order to minimize the risk of PrEPsteps capsule retention, we plan to exclude patients with underlying bowel disease or surgical intervention to the bowel.   Allergic Reaction: There is a risk of allergic reaction to the silver and zinc components of the radiofrequency transmitter, and to the gelatin pi[INVESTIGATOR_393887]. In order to minimize the risk of a potential allergic reaction, we plan to exclude patients with a known allergy to silver, zinc or gelatin.

We will take [ADDRESS_494285] participants from the risk of discoverability. • Password protection on participants’ cellphones: We will ensure that participants’ cellphones are enabled with password protection (or Touch ID, for iPhones). Participants will be the only individuals who have access to their personal cellphones. • Messaging that does not directly reveal PrEP ingestion: During focus groups in aim 1, we will craft messages from PrEPsteps that avoid inadvertent disclosure that participants are on PrEP to protect against individuals who are uninvolved in the study reading messages from PrEPsteps. Although messages are password protected, we will take the additional step of ensuring the text of messaging protects participants against PrEP discoverability. • Masking the icon of the PrEPsteps app to prevent discoverability: We will mask the icon of the PrEPsteps app as a generic “ID Cap” app to avoid discoverability of PrEP ingestion or participation in PrEPsteps. • Opaque digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393888]: The digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393889], prevent discoverability of PrEP ingestion by [CONTACT_393928]/FTC.  Psychological Discomfort of Disclosing Adherence Patterns: Participants may experience psychological discomfort in disclosing and learning of their adherence data during study visits.   IX. Potential Benefits  Participants may indirectly benefit from participation in the study by [CONTACT_393929]. Interacting and using PrEPsteps may confer some increased adherence among study participants.   X. Data Transmission from Digital Pi[INVESTIGATOR_393890]. There is no medication data that identifies study drug as Truvada, nor personal identifiers within the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393851]. Ingestion of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393891] a generic radiofrequency signal that is collected by [CONTACT_87413]. The Reader then transmits ingestion data via low energy Bluetooth to the participant’s cellular phone. This data is collected by [CONTACT_393930]’s smartphone. Within the app, data is converted to Java Script notation that describes the presence of an ingested medication. This data is transferred to servers at our collaborating industry partner, etectRx. This data is then stored on a secure server. Access is limited to etectRx maintenance technicians and the study team. For PrEPSteps interventions and text messages, receipt of digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393892]- this dashboard automates the PrEPSteps intervention and pushes messages via SMS text messaging to the participant’s phone in response to their ingestion patterns. Study participants are identified on the etectRx and NOMI dashboard only as study numbers. Their PHI is kept within secure Fenway computers. A secure excel spreadsheet that links study numbers to participant names is kept on desktop computers at Fenway accessible to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  XI. Data Monitoring and Quality Assurance

At each study visit, participants will undergo pi[INVESTIGATOR_393893], and calculate the accuracy of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393894]. Any discrepancies between the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393895]. For each participant, we will also review signaling from the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_393896] (etectRx) to ensure there are no errors in data transmission contribution to missed adherence events. If errors occur as a result of data transmission, we will correct the participant’s adherence data, and convey these changes to participants’ PCP via Mimecast secure email. We will additionally obtain dried blood spot testing at study visits 3 and 4 to confirm adherence (see section V. study procedures)  Recorded interviews: Audio-recorded interviews (Aim 1 and 3) will be transcribed using a HIPAA compliant transcription service (Landmark transcription), and scrubbed of identifiers  Aim 2 QA review: Study investigators will conduct QA review of baseline adherence data after the first [ADDRESS_494286] (DSMB): Three investigators who are external to the study and external to [CONTACT_393938]’s mentoring team as defined by [CONTACT_393931] K23 award with expertise in PrEP, non-alcohol substance use disorder, technology security and behavioral interventions, will comprise a DSMB for Aim 2 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269]) of the research plan. The DSMB will convene annually during Aim 2. Additionally, the DSMB will meet when N=30 study participants are enrolled in Aim 2. They will review the data, and any potential study related adverse events prior to approving the continuation of recruitment. The responsibilities of the DSMB will include:  • Reviewing the research protocol, consent form, and plans for DSMB. • Evaluating the progress of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269]: recruitment, retention, data quality, site performance, adverse events. • Protection of participant safety • Making recommendations to [CONTACT_393938] and the Fenway Institute IRB regarding continuation, termination or modification of the study depending on benefits or adverse events. • Ensuring the confidentiality of study data. • Reviewing adverse events. • Providing annual written reports to [CONTACT_393938], and NIH regarding safety concerns, continuation or modification of the research plan.  We will additionally comply with all Fenway regulations regarding reporting of adverse events and ensuring data quality.  Data Tracking: Ingestion data will be automatically logged into the web interface hosted by [CONTACT_393932] a date/time stamp to ensure accurate record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_393897].

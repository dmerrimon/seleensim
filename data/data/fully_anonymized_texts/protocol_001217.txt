Study Title: A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study of BBI608 in Combination with Temo zolomide for 
Adult Patients with Recurrent or Progressed Glioblastoma 
Study Number: BBI608-201GBM
Study Phase: Ib/II
Study Drug BBI608, a novel investigational small molecule anticancer drug that targets  
cancer stem cells 
Primary Objectives: The primary objective of this phase Ib/II study is to determine  t h e  s a f e t y ,  
tolerability, and preliminary anti -cancer activity of BBI608 in combination with
temozolomide (TMZ) in adult patients with recurrent or progress ive 
glioblastoma (GBM) who have not received prior treatment with b evacizumab. 
Patients who are eligible for further surgical resection will b e enrolled into Arm 
A.  Patients who are not eligible for further resection will be  enrolled into Arm 
B.
The primary efficacy endpoint will be progression -free survival at 6- months 
(PFS -6), defined as the proportion of patients who have survived without  
objective disease progression per RANO criteria for at least 6 months after 
enrollment. Secondary endpoints will include median progression  free survival 
(PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and o bjective response 
rate (ORR) (when applicable).
Secondary 
Objectives:To determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of BBI608 and of BBI60 8 plus TMZ 
when administered to this population.
To determine the pharmacodynamics (biomarkers) of BBI608 in res ected 
glioblastoma tissue (when applicable).
Study Design: This is an open-label, multi-center, phase Ib/II study of BBI608 a dministered in 
combination with TMZ to patients with recurrent or progressive GBM who have 
not received prior bevacizumab therapy.
ARM A: Patients who are candidates for surgical resection will receive BBI608 
asmonotherapy prior to resection, followed by [CONTACT_447]- operative BBI608 
administered in combination with TMZ.
BBI608 will be administered at a dose -level of 480 mg twice daily for 7 (±2)
days prior to a planned surgical resection or biopsy of recurre nt GBM.  BBI608 
will be discontinued immediately prior to the surgical procedur e and will remain 
discontinued pending clinical post -operative recovery of the patient.  
Upon the clinical recovery of the patient and at a time between 15- 28 days 
following surgery, BBI608 will be administered orally, daily, i n combination 
with temozolomide that is administered at 150 mg/m2for days 1 through 5 of 
each 28 day cycle The dose of temozolomide can be increased to 200 mg/m2as 
per standard TMZ dosing guidelines for patients who complete at lea st one cycle 
at 150 mg/m2.  The initial dose of BBI608 will be 480 mg twice daily. Dose 
adjustment is allowed.

through 5 of each 28 -day cycle. Cycles 
will repeat until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion is met.
Approximately 7( ± 2 )  days Begins between 15-28-days after surgery
ARM B: Patients who are not candidates for surgical resect ion will receive 
BBI608 administered orally, daily, in combination with temozolo mide 150 
mg/m2that is administered on days 1 through 5 of each 28-day cycle.  The dose 
of temozolomide can be increased to 200 mg/m2as per standard TMZ dosing 
guidelines for patients who complete at least one cycle at 150 mg/m2.  The 
initial dose of BBI608 will be 480 mg twice daily. Dose adjustm ent is allowed.
In the phase Ib/DLT cohort portion of this study, f or both Arms A and B, 
pharmacokinetics will be evaluated on Day [ADDRESS_73522] y.  Enrollment will be 
held if ≥2 patients are unable to undergo res ection due to DLTs. Enrollment will 
also be held if  ≥ [ADDRESS_73523] 28  d a y s  o f  
combination treatment with BBI608 and TMZ.  If DLT is observed in ≥ 2 of 6 
patients evaluable for DLT, the initial dose of BBI608 for all patients in that arm
will be reduced to the next lower dose level of 240mg twice daily and an 
additional 6 -patient safety cohort will be enrolled at that dose- level and 
evaluated for DLT as above.  Enrollment will continue at a dose -level at which 
≤ [ADDRESS_73524] schedule for BBI608. 
It is e xpected that up to 30 patients (including those enrolled to the DLT 
evaluation cohorts) will be enrolled in each arm.
For all patients on study, tumor assessments will be performed at eight- week 
intervals or as clinically indicated.  Disease status will be assessed by  [CONTACT_22242]-
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. 
Progression Free Survival will be assessed from the date of enrollment until 
objective disease progression or death. Tumor response an d progression will be 
evaluated using RANO criter ia.  Patients who are enrolled in Arm A but who do 
not undergo surgical resection will be considered evaluable for  tumor response
utilizing the same assessment criteria as employed for patients in Arm B. All
patients will be followed for dise ase progression and included in time -to-event 
analyses.
Patients will continue treatment with BBI608 and TMZ until the investigator has 
determined that they are no longer clinically benefiting due to progression of

met.  Treatment with BBI608 as monotherapy can continue if TMZ is 
discontinued for any reason. Also, the investigator may continu e BBI608 in 
combination with TMZ or BBI608 monotherapy after the initial de monstration 
of radiological progression and in the absence of intolerable t oxicities, 
performance status decline, worsening of disease related sympto ms, 
radiographical findings that would warrant acute intervention a nd no ongoing 
severe toxicities that may be related to BBI608.  The patient w ill also get repeat 
tumor assessments after 4 -6 weeks.  Treatment with BBI608 (with or without 
TMZ) will continue until unacceptable toxicity, further disease  p r o g r e s s i o n  
(clinical or radiologi cal), or another discontinuation criterion is met.
Safety will be evaluated for the duration of the study. Adverse  events will be 
documented using the current version of the NCI CTCAE (v 4.0).  
Study Populations: This study will enroll patients with histologically confirmed g lioblastoma 
(GBM) at first recurrence of disease following front -line therapy.
Patients must have received prior  treatment with standard first  line therapy for 
GBM , including maximal surgical resection and postoperative externa l-beam 
radiotherapy. Concurrent chemoradiation with TMZ is allowed but  n o t  
mandatory.
Patients are eligible for enrollment if they have unequivocal e vidence of tumor 
recurrence/progression by [CONTACT_9268] a minimum of [ADDRESS_73525] received prior 
bevacizumab or other anti -VEGF agents are not eligible to enroll.  
Baseline MRI should be performed within 28 days prior to enrollment. 
Other key inclusion criteria include ECOG status of 0-1 (KPS ≥ 70%) and 
adequate bone marrow, hepatic , and renal function at baseline.
Test Product, Dose, 
and Mode of 
Administration: BBI608 will be administered orally, twice-daily, at an initial dos e-level of [ADDRESS_73526] dose should be adminis tered in the morning and the 
second dose should be administered approximately 12 hours later.  The doses 
should be administered with fluids, one hour prior to or two hours after meals.
The BBI608 dose can be modified a ccording to the following sche dule:
Dosing Level Description
Initial Dose 480 mg twice daily   (960 mg total daily)
Modification Level –1 240 mg twice daily   (480 mg total daily)
Modification Level –2 80 mg twice daily     (160 mg total daily)
Modification Level –3 80 mg once daily (80 mg total daily)
TMZ will be administered orally, once daily, at a dose of 150 m g/m2daily on 
days 1 through 5 of each 28 -day study cycle. T he dose of temozolomide can be 
increased to 200 mg/m2as per standard TMZ dosing guidelines for patient s who 
complete at least one cycle at 150 mg/m2.
Duration of 
Treatment: For an individual patient, treatment with BBI608 and TMZ will c ontinue until 
unacceptable toxicity, disease p rogression (clinical or radiolo gical) ,or another 
discontinuation criterion is met.  Treatment with BBI608 as mon otherapy can 
continue if TMZ is discontinued for any reason.  Also, the inve stigator may 
continue BBI608 in combination with TMZ or BBI608 monotherapy a fter the 
initial demonstration of radiographic progression and in the ab sence of 
intolerable toxicities.  The patient will also get repeat tumor  assessments after 4-
6 weeks. Treatment with BBI608 (with or without TMZ) will conti nue until 
unacceptable toxicity, further disease progression (clinical or  radiological), or

Criteria for 
Determination of Dose
-Limiting 
Toxicity: A DLT is defined by [CONTACT_67422], 
probably or definitely related to BBI608 or to BBI608 in combination with T MZ
during the first 28 days of combination treatment: 
xCTCAE Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant blee ding
xCTCAE Grade 4 hemato logical toxicity. 
xCTCAE Grade 3 non-hemato logical toxicity, except:
oGrade [ADDRESS_73527] <[ADDRESS_73528] occurrence of DVT or PE will not be 
considered a DLT. 
xToxicities le ading to delay of study treatment for ≥ [ADDRESS_73529] 28  d a y s  o f  
comb ination therapy.  DLTs will be determined from adverse events, and 
changes from baseline in physical examination findings and in laboratory 
parameters.  Patients who do not complete 28 days of combinatio n therapy for 
reasons other than DLT may be replaced.
Adverse events considered related to TMZ only will not be consi dered DLTs for 
BBI608 in combination with TMZ. 
Pharmacokinetic 
and Pharmacodynamic Variables: Pharmacokinetic variables to be determined include maximum plas ma drug 
concentration (Cmax), area under the time- concentration curve (AUC), and 
terminal half -life. Blood samples for PK determination will be drawn over 12
h o u r s  o n  D a y  1  a n d  a g a i n  o n  D a y  5  o f  Cycle 1 of BBI608 and TMZ 
combination therapy. Archival tissue (15 -30 unstained slides or t issue block) 
from primary tumor resection will be collected from all patient s.  When 
possible, the following tissue will be collected from the repea t resection 
procedure: fresh frozen tissue and formalin fixed, paraffin -embedded, tissue. 
Archival samples will be used to examine potential predictive b iomarkers for 
therapeutic activity of BBI608 or of BBI608 plus TMZ, while samples obtained 
from the on -study resection procedure will be used to investigate evidence of 
BBI608 presence in resected tumor tissue and to evaluate pharmacodynamics. 
Statistical Methods: In general, categorical variables will be summarized as the num ber and 
percentage of patients in each category. Continuous variables w ill be 
summarized by [CONTACT_67423], standard deviation, median, minimum, an d maximum.
The primary population for the efficacy endpoints will be the P er Protocol 
population defined as the population of patients who have been treated with at 
least 80% of 1 complete cycle of BBI608 and TMZ. Analyses will also be 
performed on the Intent-to- Treat (ITT) population in each arm. Analyses will 
also be performed on The primary endpoint is PFS- 6, defined as the proportion 
of patients with PFS (i.e. absence of documented objective prog ression or death) 
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 6  at 6 months after enrollment.
With a sample size of 30 patients, the lower bound of the two -sided 80% 
confidence interval, as estimated by [CONTACT_67424] a projected 
PFS-6 rate of 20%, will be greater than 10%, a nd provides meaningful 
information for further clinical evaluation.
The secondary endpoints will include OS (overall survival), def ined as the 
interval between the date of patient enrollment until death; PF S (progression 
free survival), defined as the interval between the date of patient enrollment and 
objective progression or death; ORR (objective response rate), the proportion of 
patients with a documented comp lete response or partial respons e according to 
the RANO criteria; and DCR (disease control rate), the proporti on of patients 
with documented stable disease, partial response, or complete r esponse 
according to RANO criteria. 
Safety analyses will include adverse events, SAEs, laboratory t ests, and physical 
examination changes from baseline.  All patients receiving at l east one daily 
dose of BBI608 will be considered evaluable for safety analyses .  In addition to 
the evaluation and categorization of adverse events, listings o f laboratory test 
results collected at baseline and during the study will be gene rated.  Descriptive 
statistics summarizing the changes in those laboratory tests ov er time will be 
presented.

BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #[ADDRESS_73535] uncovered the presence of cancer stem cells  (CSCs, also called tumor 
initiating cells or cancer stem-like cells), which have self-re newal capability and are 
considered to be fundamentally responsible for malignant growth , relapse, and metastasis. 
Importantly, CSCs are inherently resistant to conventional ther api[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Therefore, a targeted 
agent with activity against cancer stem cells holds great promi se for cancer patients [Boman 
and Wicha, 2008; Clevers, 2011; Lobo et al., 2007; Magee et al., 2012; Singh and Settleman, 2010). Specifically in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), CSCs have been r eported to be 
responsible for both disease pathogenesis and resistance of GBM  to therapy  [Singh 2004, 
Chen 2012, Bao 2006, Beier 2008].
BBI608 is a small molecule that targets cancer by [CONTACT_67425] -renewal of and inducing 
apoptosis in cancer stem cells. While not a kinase inhibitor, B BI608 works by [CONTACT_67426]3 pathway. With their proprietary target discovery technolo gy TPIV®, scientists at 
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc. have dis covered that STAT3 pathway acti vity is critical for the self-
renewal and survival of cancer stem cells in human cancer, incl uding GBM
.
1.2 Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) 
GBM is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In the U nited States, 3,336 new cases 
of GBM were estimated to occur in 2012, and 2,055 of these pati ents died from this disease 
[NCI SEER] . GBM accounts for approximately 50% of all primary brain tumors . 
Unfortunately, GBM patients have f ew treatment options: standar d of care consists of 
maximal resection of tumor followed by [CONTACT_67427] t emozolomide (TMZ), an 
oral alkylating agent, with additional TMZ chemotherapy until p rogression of disease, which 
is the unfortunate outcome in nearly all patients. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_67384], prognosis 
with standard of care treatment remains poor, as median surviva l is 15-17 months [Stupp 
2005; Chinot 2014] .
A retrospective review of 168 recurrent-GBM patients from a sin gle center suggested that 
retreatment at relapse may lead to increase in progression free  survival (PFS) as well as in 
overall survival (OS) [Hau 2003] . Standard treatment for recurrent GBM includes 
chemotherapy, usually administered until evidence of further di sease progression, and 
possible tumor debulking in select patients. A randomized Phase  3 study comparing TMZ to 
nitrosoureas in chemotherapy-naïve patients with recurrent GBM reported no statistically 
significant difference between these two treatment arms. For th e TMZ arm, the study 
reported a median PFS of 5 months and a median OS of 8.5 months  [Brada 2010] . A Phase 
II study of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent GBM followin g adjuvant first-line TMZ 
treatment resulted in an objective response rate of 28%, 6 mont h PFS of 43%, and a 
decreased need for steroids, but did not result in a prolonged OS [Cloughesy 2010] . Overall, 
there is a lack of standard sec ond-line therapy recommendations . Management of patients 
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #[ADDRESS_73536], one of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_67385]133 marks GBM stem cells [Singh 2004] .
Targeting stem cells, therefore, holds great promise for fundam entally advancing cancer 
treatment, including that for GBM.
Accumulating evidence indicates that CSCs play a key role in bo th the initiation of GBM 
[Singh 2004]  and in tumor recurrence (in the latter via its role in chemora diotherapy 
resistance) [Chen 2012, Bao 2006, Beier 2008] . Cancer stem cells have been isolated from 
human GBM using cell surface markers such as Lgr5 [Nakata 2013, Mao 2013]  and CD133 
[Singh 2004, Brescia 2013] . CSCs isolated from GBM patients display both tumor-initiating  
properties and resistance to chemotherapeutics. These findings suggest that the development 
of cancer stem cell inhibitors represents a novel and compellin g strategy for the treatment of 
GBM.
1.4 Mechanism of Action 
STAT3 is aberrantly activated in a wide variety of human cancer s, including GBM, all of the 
major carcinomas, and in some hematologic tumors. STAT3 is a ke y transcription factor that 
is activated in 50-80% of GBM, is associated with advanced tumo r grade, is involved in 
resistance to TMZ, and is correlated with worse outcome in both  animal models of human 
GBM and in human patients, regardless of MGMT status [Carro 2010, Kohsaka 2012, 
Stechishin 2013, Lo 2008] . Importantly, STAT3 is the master transcription factor underly ing 
the mesenchymal subtype of human glioma [Dunn 2012; Phillips 2006; Carr 2010] .
Inhibition of STAT3 in vitro potentiates TMZ efficacy in TMZ-re sistant GBM cell lines and 
data suggest that STAT3 mediates MGMT expression [Kohsaka 2012] . These data 
demonstrate that both GBM pathogenesis and chemoradioresistance  may be regulated by 
[CONTACT_67428]3 and therefore establish a powerful rationale for the deve lopment of GBM cancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_67386]3 activity. 
1.5 Preclinical Efficacy

BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 15  Cancer stem cells are intrinsically resistant (more than 5 to 1 0  fold) to chemotherapeutic 
drugs. BBI608 has potent activity (~100 to 500 nM) against canc er stem cells in vitro and in 
vivo, and moreover spares normal hematopoietic stem cells (IC50 not  reached at 30 ʛM);
these properties offer a wide therapeutic window. The dependenc e on STAT3 for aberrant 
activity is conserved in various non-stem cancer cells. BBI608 has demonstrated in vitro 
efficacy against a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines de rived from both solid tumors 
and hematologic malignancies (IC50 ~100 nM to 500 nM). BBI608 m onotherapy has 
demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in vivo , and in the absence of adverse effects, in 
multiple murine xenograft models of human cancer, including tho se of brain, liver, head and 
neck, breast, prostate, colon, gastric and pancreatic cancers. Additionally, in vivo 
spontaneous metastasis mouse models have demonstrated that BBI6 [ADDRESS_73537] therapeu tic potential of BBI608 in

1.6 GLP Toxicology  
GLP 28-day repeat dose toxicology studies were performed in bot h rats and dogs at doses of 
10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day of BBI608 by [CONTACT_16759].   
In the rat study, 100 mg/kg was not tolerated by [CONTACT_67429].  Toxic observations include 
significant weight loss, soft feces and diarrhea, and decreased  food consumption, which led 
to early sacrifice. These symptoms recovered in the remaining m ale rats within 14 days after     
termination of dosing. Female rats receiving 100 mg/kg/day show ed weight loss during the 
first week of dosing; however, weight recovered during the cont inued dosing phase without 
significant abnormal clinical observations.  
In the rat study, abnormal laboratory findings (azotemia, hypon atremia, hypochloremia, 
hyperkalemia, polycythemia, neutrophilia, monocytosis, and lymp hopenia) were observed 
primarily in moribund male rats dosed at 100 mg/kg. These findi ngs are consistent with acute 
renal failure in the setting of dehydration and diarrhea. In ra ts dosed at 100 mg/kg for 28 
days, there was a mild decrease in sodium, chloride, and albumin levels and mild elevation of 
white blood cells, red blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes an d monocytes. No significant 
abnormal laboratory findings were seen in recovered rats, sugge sting that these abnormal 
laboratory findings are reversible. There were no abnormal labo ratory findings in rats dosed 
at 10 and 30 mg/kg.  
In the rat study, histopathological findings were noted in the rats dosed at 100 mg/kg, 
primarily in moribund male rats, including microscopic changes in the stomach and urinary 
bladder (focal or multifocal c hronic ulceration, epi[INVESTIGATOR_67387], chronic active

atrophy with mild to moderate lymphocyte apoptosis in thymus, m ild to moderate lymphoid 
atrophy and mild to moderate mastocytosis in mesenteric lymph n odes, mild to moderate 
lymphoid atrophy in two moribund male rats dosed at 100 mg/kg, and some elevation of 
hemosiderosis in the spleen) and in adrenal glands (mild cortic al vacuolation). These findings 
were considered to be non-specific changes related to the test vehicle in the setting of 
dehydration and diarrhea. There were no significant histopathol ogical findings in recovered 
rats, suggesting that these histopathological changes are rever sible. There was no significant 
test vehicle related microscopic changes in rats dosed at 30 mg /kg and at 10 mg/kg.  
In the rat study, toxicokinetics showed that all dose groups in  rats achieved BBI608 exposure 
at a level well above the predicted exposure levels needed for efficacy, and exposure lasted 
beyond 10 hours.  
In the dog study, toxicity was observed in dogs receiving 100 m g/kg/day.  Toxic symptoms 
consisted of mild weight loss, emesis, diarrhea, and mucoid and  soft feces. These adverse 
effects were reversible within [ADDRESS_73538] level  (NOAEL, based on clinical observation, laboratory 
tests, gross and histopathological changes) for rats administer ed BBI608 daily orally over 28 
days was 30 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose: 180 mg/m2) and th e NOAEL in dogs 
administered BBI608 daily orally over 28 days was 30 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose: 
600 mg/m2). 
1.7 Safety and Encouraging Signs of Antitumor Activity in Phase I and II Studies 
In the Phase I dose escalation study of BBI608 monotherapy, 14 cohorts (N=41) were dosed 
from 20 mg to 2000 mg/day.  All of the patients in this study w ere in the last line of 
treatment setting. Eighteen (44%) of the patients had CRC, whic h was the most common type 
of cancer studied in this trial. Other types of cancers varied from 2-7% of the total, and 
included gastric/GEJ, pancreatic, NSCLC, prostate, head and nec k, melanoma and others.  
The vast majority of the patients (78%) in this study had progr essed on >3 prior regimens. 
Adverse events were generally mild, including grade 1-2 diarrhe a, nausea, anorexia and 
fatigue with a total of 4 grade 3 events (diarrhea and fatigue) . MTD was not reached. At 400 
mg/day, the plasma concentration of BBI608 was sustained at a c oncentration > 1.5 uM 
(several fold above the IC 50 [avg.~0.09 uM]) for >8 hours.  RP2D has been determined to be 
480 mg bid. Among those evaluable for tumor response (using REC IST 1.1 criteria), disease 
control (disease stabilization and regression) was observed in 65% of patients. Prolonged 
time to progression was observed in 46% of evaluable patients, including patients with CRC, 
head & neck, gastric, ovarian, melanoma, and breast cancers. In  the subset of patients with 
CRC (N=18), disease control was seen in 67% of those evaluable.   Median progression free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of 14 and 47 weeks, re spectively, were observed in 
evaluable CRC patients.  Median OS for biomarker-positive (nucl ear E-catenin and high p-
STAT3) CRC patients was 53 weeks and 54 weeks, respectively.  I n this study, BBI608 has 
shown a favorable safety and PK profile, and encouraging signs of activity, particularly in 
CRC.

BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 17  In addition, BBI608 has been evaluated in combination therapy i n the Phase Ib/II studies. 
BBI608 has been safely combined at full dose with paclitaxel or  capecitabine (BBI608-201 
and BBI608-224, respectively), with a similar adverse event pro file compared to that of 
either BBI608 or paclitaxel monotherapy. The RP2D of BBI608 in combination with weekly 
paclitaxel or capecitabine has  been determined to be 480 mg twi ce daily.

combined with weekly Paclitaxel and at 240mg either as monother apy or combined with 
weekly Paclitaxel.  Plasma levels of BBI608 in subjects taking budesonide were similar to 
the ones that had not received budesonide prophylaxis at BBI608  doses of 240mg and 480mg 
bid, either with or without the addition of weekly Paclitaxel i nfusion. 
Given the clinical data thus far, and the encouraging in vitro  and in vivo  results seen with the 
combination of BBI608 with TMZ, further evaluation of BBI608 in  combination therapy to 
treat GBM is warranted.

Confidential Page 21  4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Overall Study Design 
This is an open-label, multi-center Phase Ib/II, study of BBI60 [ADDRESS_73549] not received 
prior treatment with bevacizumab and who may or may not be elig ible for further surgical 
resection. The primary efficacy endpoint will be PFS-6. Seconda ry efficacy endpoints will 
include median PFS, OS, DCR and ORR.  
Arm A  will include patients who are candidates for repeat surgical r esection. These patients 
will receive 7 (±2) days of BBI608 monotherapy at a dose level o f 480 mg twice daily (960 
mg total daily dose – Initial Dose) prior to resection. Following surgical clinical recovery, 
and on a date between 15-28 days following the date of surgery,  BBI608 (480 mg twice 
daily) will be restarted in combination with TMZ (150 mg/m2 on days 1 through 5 of each 
28-day cycle). If a patient does not recover from surgical rese ction sufficiently within 28 
days to resume oral therapy with BBI608 plus TMZ, the patient s hould be withdrawn from 
study. Combination therapy will continue until disease progress ion or another 
discontinuation criterion is met.  The dose of TMZ can be incre ased to 200 mg/m2 for those 
patients who complete at least one cycle at 150 mg/m2in combination with BBI608.   
Arm B  will include patients who are either not candidates for repeat  surgical resection or 
have undergone repeat surgical resection prior to enter the stu dy. These patients will receive 
BBI608 (480 mg twice daily) in combination with TMZ (150 mg/m2 administered for days 1 
through 5 of each 28 day cycle) and continue treatment until dis ease progression or another 
discontinuation criterion is met. The dose of TMZ can be increa sed to 200 mg/m2 for those 
patients who complete at least one cycle at 150 mg/m2 in combin ation with BBI608.   
Initially, [ADDRESS_73550] 28 days of 
combination treatment. For patient in Arm A during the run-in pe riod with BBI608 
monotherapy, the same DLT rules as for the combination therapy will apply.  Enrollment will 
be held if ≥ 2 patients are unable to undergo resection due to DLTs.  Enrollment will also be 
held if ≥ [ADDRESS_73551] an unexpected surgical complication.
For a given arm, if > 2 out of 6 patients experience a DLT, then  the BBI608 dose will be 
reduced for all patients in that arm to the next lower dose leve l of 240mg twice daily. 
Furthermore, an additional 6-patient safety cohort in that stud y arm will be enrolled at the
reduced dose-level and evaluate d for DLT as described below.  
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) will be defined as the dose-lev el evaluated at which < [ADDRESS_73552] of

4.2 Rationale for Study Design  
Considerable data has been collected from the Phase I monothera py study of BBI608 as well 
as from phase 1b/II studies conducted in advanced oncology pati ents who have failed 
multiple previous regimens. BBI608 has shown a favorable safety  and PK profile and 
encouraging signs of activity. Combination of cancer stem cell therapeutics with 
chemotherapy would allow simultaneous inhibition of cancer stem  cells as well as non-stem 
tumor bulk cells. Given the clinical data thus far, and the enc ouraging in vitro  and in vivo
results seen with combination of BBI608 with TMZ, further evalu ation of BBI608 in 
combination therapy to treat GBM is warranted. 
4.[ADDRESS_73553] be en generally mild (Grade 1-
2) with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, anorexia and fa tigue.  Grade 3 events 
include fatigue and diarrhea. No bone marrow suppression or neu ropathy was observed. 
In phase 1b/II studies, BBI608 has been successfully combined a t full dose (480 mg twice 
daily) with weekly paclitaxel or capecitabine, without any sign s of adverse effects that differ 
from those that occur when either agent is administered as monot herapy.  
Dosing of BBI608 in each combination arm of this trial will be initiated at 480 mg twice 
daily; this dose is the monotherapy RP2D for BBI608 and is also  the RP2D of BBI608 in 
combination with weekly paclitaxel or capecitabine.
4.4 Criteria for Dose Escalation and Determination of Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 23  Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated separately in ea ch study arm. Patients 
evaluable for DLT assessment are defined as having been exposed  to at least 28 days of 
continuous daily administration of BBI608 in combination with T MZ (i.e. DLT evaluation 
period starts from the first administration of TMZ), or having h ad a protocol-defined DLT at 
any time within this period. Based on the tolerability and safe ty of evaluable patients, 
enrollment of additional patients  will occur according to crite ria described below:  
xIf <1 treated patients experien ce a BBI608-related DLT (defined  below) by [CONTACT_2006] 28 of 
Cycle 1 of combination therapy with TMZ, then additional patien ts will be enrolled at 
this BBI608 dose into the RP2D expansion cohort.
xIf >2 treated patients at a dose level experience a BBI608-rela ted DLT by [CONTACT_2006] 28 of 
Cycle 1, patient enrollment into this BBI608 dose level cohort will stop and the 
BBI608 dose will be reduced to the next lower  dose level of 24 0mg twice daily. An
additional 6-patient safety cohort will be enrolled at the redu ced dose-level and 
evaluated for DLT.

Section 5.7).   
[ADDRESS_73559] of a Pre-Study Evaluation, during whi ch the patient is evaluated to 
determine suitability for entry i nto the study; On-Treatment Ev aluations, during which the 
patient is regularly evaluated during the conduct of the study;  and an End-of-Study 
Evaluation (See APPENDIX A and APPENDIX B for schedules of Asse ssments). 
Following the Pre-Study Evaluation and a determination by a Pri ncipal Investigator that the 
patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and after the p atient signs the informed consent, 
the patient will be considered enrolled in the study.   
In general, unless otherwise noted, a window of ± 2 days is all owed when scheduling 
protocol visits and evaluations.  If, due to unforeseen circums tances, frame-shifting of a 
study cycle or patient visit schedule occurs beyond the allowab le window of ± 2 days, the 
medical monitor for the Sponsor should be notified of the alter nate schedule.  The protocol

*RANO criteria serve to categorize clinical radiologic images.  Given a unique mechanism of 
action targeting cancer stem cells, BBI608 therapy may be conti nued in a patient who is 
clinically well, but who meets criteria for “Progressed Disease” per RANO criteria.  
Continuation of BBI608 protocol therapy in this context is allo wed provided no further 
standard, approved treatment options exist; and provided the in vestigator assess that the 
potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk a nd in the absence of intolerable 
toxicities, performance status decline, worsening of disease re lated symptoms, radiological 
findings that would warrant acute intervention and no ongoing s evere toxicities that may be 
related to BBI608.  The patient will also get repeat tumor asse ssments after 4-6 weeks.  
Treatment with BBI608 (with or without TMZ) will continue until  unacceptable toxicity, 
further disease progression (clinical or radiological), or anot her discontinuation criterion is 
met.

The following clarifies important dates at the end of study tre atment: 
Date of Last Dose: The date th at the last dose of BBI608 is taken.  The Date of Last 
Dose does not necessarily need to be the Date Off Active Study.
Date Off Active Study: The date when both the patient and the investigator/study team 
understand the patient to be off of active protocol treatment.  I n  
most cases, this will be the same as the Date of Last Dose ;
however, it does not need to be the case.  In addition, the Date Off

Archival formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples  from a previous resection 
or biopsy of the patient’s glioblastoma  should be collected from all patients enrolled in the 
clinical trial. 
For patients enrolled into Arm A, the archival tumor tissue wil l serve as a baseline  sample 
prior to starting treatment with BBI608.  An on-treatment  tumor sample will be collected 
during the surgical tumor resection, following completion of th e 1-week BBI608 
monotherapy treatment.  
Tumor samples that are obtained at the time of surgical resecti on and are labeled with study 
protocol identification number and patient identification numbe r will be sent to a regulatory 
authority-approved tumor bank affiliated with the study site, o r to the study site pathology 
department if the site does not have a regulatory authority-app roved tumor bank. 
Appropriately processed tumor specimens would be then forwarded  to the Sponsor or

BBI608 was shown in vitro to inhibit individual CYP P450 isoforms 1A2, 2D6, 2C19, 3A4, 
and 2C9 with IC50’s of 0.25 μM, 0.25 μM, 2.5 μM, 5 μM, and 0.5 μM respectively, under 
serum-free conditions. Since BBI608 has shown the ability to in hibit these CYP P450 
isoforms in vitro , concomitant use of agents that are substrates of these CYP P4 50 enzymes 
should be used only if deemed medically necessary by [CONTACT_67439] y investigator. Examples of 
commonly prescribed agents that are metabolized by [CONTACT_67440] P4 50 enzymes are: 
  NSAIDS: such as ibuprofen, naproxen

BBI608 is metabolized by [CONTACT_2750] P450 isoform 1A2. Therefore, c oncomitant use of drugs 
that inhibit or induce CYP1A2 should be avoided unless deemed m edically necessary by [CONTACT_67441].   
Known drugs that inhibit CYP 1A2 include ciprofloxacin and othe r fluoroquinolones, 
Fluvoxamine Verapamil, amiodarone, interferon, methoxsalen, eno xacin, mexiletine, and 
ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325].

7.6.2 Budesonide - Interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant oral administration of ketoconazole (a known inhibi tor of CYP3A4 activity in 
the liver and in the intestinal mucosa) caused an eight-fold in crease of the systemic exposure 
to oral budesonide. If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 acti vity (such as ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin) i s indicated, discontinuation of 
budesonide should be considered. After extensive intake of grap efruit juice (which inhibits 
CYP3A4 activity predominantly in the intestinal mucosa), the sy stemic exposure for oral 
budesonide increased about two times. Ingestion of grapefruit o r grapefruit juice should be 
avoided in connection with budesonide administration.

study. All AEs considered to be r elated to BBI608 occurring aft er any administration of the 
study drug will be followed until the event resolves. AEs will be evaluated using the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE, Version 4.0.
Investigators are required to document all AEs occurring during  the clinical trial, 
commencing with study enrollment and including the protocol-def ined post-treatment 
follow-up period (21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] §312.64[ b]) on designated CRF 
pages. It is also important to record all AEs that result in pe rmanent discontinuation of the 
investigational product being studied, whether serious or non-s erious. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs), as defined below, must be report ed to [LOCATION_011] Biomedical or 
its representative within 24 hours of knowledge of their occurr ence. 
8.1.2 Definitions 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurr ence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject that does not necessarily have a causal r elationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (inc luding an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to  the medicinal product. 
Laboratory data are to be collected as stipulated in this proto col, and toxicity trends will be 
analyzed utilizing objective toxicity criteria.  Clinical syndr omes associated with laboratory 
abnormalities are to be recorded as appropriate (e.g., diabetes  mellitus instead of 
hyperglycemia).   
Progression of disease is considered an efficacy outcome parame ter and should not be 
captured as an AE.  A non-serious AE is any untoward medical oc currence that does not 
meet any of the criteria for SAEs as defined below. 
Patients should be instructed to report any AE that they experi ence to the Investigator.  
Investigators should assess the patient for AEs at each visit.  AEs occurring during the 
clinical trial and the follow-up period should be recorded on t he appropriate AE CRF.  To 
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #[ADDRESS_73591] accurate AE terms on CRFs. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than i ndividual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_67442].  However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a compon ent of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_093], it should be recorded as a separa te AE on the CRF. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
8.2.1 Definitions 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event occurring at  any dose that results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
xDeath 
xA life-threatening adverse drug experience 
xInpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_67409]/incapacity 
xA congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events may be considered an SAE based upon ap propriate medical 
judgment.

Confidential Page 44  9 ASSESSMENT OF ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITY 
The following definitions and criteria (from Response Assessmen t in Neuro-Oncology 
[RANO Wen et al., 2010] Working Group criteria) should be used for the baseline 
evaluations of existing disease, and for the ongoing evaluation  of tumor responses. 
Measurable disease - presence of at least one measurable lesion.  
Measurable lesions  - lesions that are bidimensionally contrast-enhancing with cle arly 
defined margins by [CONTACT_28842], with two perpendicular diame ters of at least 10 mm, 
visible on two or more axial slices that are preferably, at mos t, 5 mm apart with 0-mm skip. 
The size of a measurable lesion at baseline should be two times  the slice thickness. 
Non-measurable lesions  - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest perpendi cular 
diameters < 10 mm), unidimensionally measurable lesions, or mas ses with margins not 
clearly defined. 
xAll measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notatio n, using a 
ruler or calipers. 
xThe same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline an d during follow-
up.
xTumor surrounding a cyst or a surgical cavity should be conside red non-
measurable unless there is a nodular component measuring > 10 m m in 
diameter.  
9.1 Method of Measurement 
xMRI (T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images as well as T2-weighte d/FLAIR 
images) is the best currently available and reproducible method  to measure 
target lesions selected for res ponse assessment.  Conventional MRI should be 
performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_73593] (for pa tients with 
MRI non-compatible devices), or at least with the same magnet s trength, for 
the duration of the study to redu ce difficulties in interpretat ion of images. 
9.2 Baseline Documentation of “T arget” and “Non-Target” Lesions 
xIf there are multiple contrast-enhancing lesions, a minimum of two lesions up 
to a maximum of five lesions total should be identified as target lesions  and 
recorded and measured at baseline. 
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 45  xTarget lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (l esions with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated m easurements 
(either by [CONTACT_67443]). 
xOccasionally, the largest lesions may not allow reproducible re peated 
measurements, and the next largest lesions that can be measured  reproducibly 
should be selected. 
xA sum of the products of the perpendicular longest diameters (L D) for all 
target lesions  will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The 
baseline sum LD will be used as the reference by [CONTACT_67444]. 
xPatients with multiple lesions of which only 1 or 2 are increas ing in size, the 
enlarging lesions should be considered the target lesions  for evaluation of 
response. The other lesions will be considered non-target lesions  and should 
also be recorded.    
xThe cystic or surgical cavity should not be measured for respon se 
determination. 
xAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as  non-target lesions
and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these  lesions are 
not required, but the presence or absence of each should be not ed throughout 
follow-up.
9.[ADDRESS_73594]-operative 
baseline scan (performed 48- 72 hours after surgery) should be u sed for response assessment. 
Response criteria are outlined below. In the event that the rad iographic changes are equivocal 
and it is unclear whether the patient is stable or has develope d progressive disease, it is 
permissible to continue treatment and observe the patient close ly, for example at 4-week 
intervals. If subsequent imaging studies demonstrate that progr ession has occurred, the date 
of progression should be the date of the scan at which progress ion was first suspected.  
Complete Response* 
Requires ALL of the following: 
1. Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-me asurable disease 
sustained for at least 4 weeks. 
2. No new lesions. 3. Stable or improved non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions. 4. Patients must be off corticos teroids (or on physiologic repla cement doses only). 
5. Patients must be stable or improved clinically.
#
Partial Response* 
[LOCATION_011] Biomedical, Inc  March 9, 2017 
BBI608-201GBM  Amendment #3 
Confidential Page 46  Requires ALL of the following:
1. Greater than or equal to 50% decrease compared to baseline in  the sum of products of 
perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sus tained for at least 4 
weeks.  
2. No progression of non-measurable disease.  3. No new lesions.  4. Stable or improved non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same o r lower dose of 
corticosteroids compare d to baseline scan. 
5. The corticosteroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation sh ould be no greater than 
the dose at time of baseline scan. 
6. Patients must be stable or improved clinically.
#
Stable Disease 
Requires ALL of the following: 
1. Does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression. 
2. Stable non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR)  lesions on same or lower dose  of corticosteroids 
compared to baseline scan. IN the event that the corticosteroid  dose was increased for 
new symptoms and signs without confirmation of disease progress ion on 
neuroimaging, and subsequent follow-up imaging shows that this increase in 
corticosteroids was required be cause of disease progression, th e last scan considered 
to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corti costeroid use was 
equivalent to the baseline dose. 
3. Patients must be stable clinically.#
Progressive Disease 
Defined by [CONTACT_67445]: 
1. Greater than 25% increase in the sum of the products of perpe ndicular diameters of 
enhancing lesions compared to the smallest tumor measurement ob tained either at 
baseline (if no decrease) or be st response, on stable or increa sing doses of 
corticosteroids.** 
2. Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stab le or increasing doses 
of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan or best response f ollowing initiation of 
therapy,* not due to co-morbid events (e.g. radiation therapy, demyelination, 
ischemic injury, infection, seizures, post-operative changes, o r other treatment 
effects).  
3. Any new lesion. 4. Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes  apart from the tumor (e.g. 
seizures, medication side effects, complications of therapy, ce rebrovascular events, 
infection, etc.) or changes in corticosteroid dose.
#
5. Failure to return for evaluation due to death or deterioratin g condition. 
6. Unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease. 
*Patients with non-measurable disease only cannot have a comple te or partial response. The 
best response possible is stable disease. 
**Stable doses of corticosteroids include patients not on corti costeroids.

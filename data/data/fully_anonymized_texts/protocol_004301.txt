2. SYNOPSIS  
 
STUDY DRUG:  
 Mirabegron  25-50 mg daily  
STUDY TITLE:  
 A pi[INVESTIGATOR_675384] (PD)  
STUDY OVERVIEW:  This study is  a randomized 1:1 placebo -controlled 10-week study of 
mirabegron  as add -on therapy to an educational intervention of behavioral 
modification including pelvic floor exercise (PFE) in a cohort of 40 PD  
subjects over the age of 30 with overactive bladder (OAB).    Active drug 
will be mirabegron 25  mg daily with up -titrati on to 50  mg daily after 5 
weeks.  Subjects will be enrolled based on response to an overactive 
bladder questionnaire  at baseline –visit 2 . Voiding diaries (72-hr) will be 
utilized following the  screening visit and phone visits  [ADDRESS_913134] the time of each micturition and/or urgency 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], urine  volume with each void, any epi[INVESTIGATOR_162748],  and the 
severity of urgency  (according to the scale used in the Overactive Bladder 
Symptom Composite Score, O AB-SCS): 1 = no urgency  (normal voiding);  
2 = mild (could postpone voiding  for as long as  necessary without fear of 
incontinence ); 3 = moderate (could  postpone voiding  for a short while 
without fear of  leakage ); 4= severe ( could not postpone, had to rush t o the 
toilet ); 5= urgency incontinence (could not make it to the toilet without 
some leakage) .    
 
Diaries will also record pelvic floor exercises. Primary outcome will be 
change in mean daily OAB -SCS (summation of all urgency scores 
recorded at  all voids throughout the 72hr diary recording  averaged over 3 
days), visit 4  vs. baseline.   
 
STUDY HYPOTHESIS:  
 
 Treatment with Mirabegron will improve urinary urgency control beyond 
that achieved with pelvic floor exercises alone . 
STUDY SUBJECTS:  
 40 subjects with Parkinson disease  and OAB complaints .   
DESIGN:  Multiple -dose, randomized, placebo -controlled prospective, single -site, 
investigator -initiated trial.  
DURATION OF STUDY : 
 10 weeks (active treatment)  
TREATMENT REGIMEN:  
 Group A will receive Mirabegron 25mg daily; at  visit 3 , those who up -
titrate will receive two 25mg tablets  
Group B will receive placebo; at visit 3 , those who up -titrate will receive 
two placebo tablets  
Group A and B  will receive the same baseline education in pelvic floor 
exercise based on viewing of an instructional PowerPoint presentation  plus 
take-home printed material.

(Outcome measures) : 
 Primary Outcome Measure  
Change in mean daily OAB -SCS, visit 4 vs. baseline . 
 
Secondary Outcome Measures  based on voiding diary  
• Change in mean  daily OAB -SCS, Visit 3  vs. baseline  
• Mean number of micturitions  per 24 hours, Visit 3  and Visit 4  vs. 
baseline  
• Mean number of incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_612183] 24 hours, Visit 3  and 
Visit 4  vs. baseline  
• Mean volume voided pe r micturition, Visit 3  and  Visit 4  vs. 
baseline  
 
Secondary Outcome Measures based on clinic visits  
• Overactive Bladder questionnaire  symptom severity scale  (OAB -q), 
Visit 3  and Visit 4  vs. baseline  
• Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), which includes questions 
about cognition, psychosis, and constipation, in addition to urinary 
symptoms; Visit 3  and Visit 4  vs. baseline.  
• Patient Perception of Bladder Condition at Visit 3  and Visit 4  vs. 
baseline  
• Subject’s  Global Impression of Change at Visit 3  and Visit 4  vs. 
baseline  
STATISTICAL METHODS : Demographics and baseline disease characteristics , including age, gender, 
duration of disease, modified Hoehn and Yahr  stage, MDS -UPDRS motor 
(part 3) subscore, PD medications including levodopa -equivalent daily 
dose (LEDD), and other medications for OAB will be compared between 
study groups.  
 
LEDD will be calculated according to standa rdized formulae (Tomlinson 
2010 ). 
 
Analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures will include:  
• Summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum) at baseline , visit 3  and visit 4 by 
[CONTACT_3148] .  
• Summary of % change from baseline to visit 3  and 4. 
• Significance testing  
 
The primary time points for all comparative measures will be Baseline 
Visit (Visit 2), Titration Visit (Visit 3) and Final Visit (Visit 4).  Outcome 
measures will be compared between g roups using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) or other method  as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_675393] . Demonstration of superiority will depend on achieving 
statistical significance for the primary endpoint. Level of significance will 
be defined  as p = 0.05. All statistical tests will be two -sided.  Statistical

SAFETY:  
 Female subjects will undergo urine pregnancy testing if they are deemed to 
have any risk of being pregnant or becoming pregnant during the study.  
Baseline assessment of CBC, CMP , urinalysis, urine culture,  and post -void 
residual will be conducted to address exclusion criteria.  
 
Adverse Event Monitoring:  
• This will be assessed at phone visits , visit [ADDRESS_913139] and unscheduled visits as needed (see 
below)  
• Additionally, post -void residual will be assessed at screening,  visit 
3, and visit [ADDRESS_913140] of monitoring and recording all adverse 
events, including serious adverse events. An adverse event is any 
undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after starting 
study drug (o r therapy). Medical conditions/diseases present before starting 
study treatment are only considered adverse events if they worsen after 
starting study treatment.  
 
Adverse events include adverse drug reactions, illness with onset during 
the study, exacerba tions of pre -existing conditions or clinically significant 
changes in physical examination or significantly abnormal objective test 
findings.  All adverse events will be recorded and graded as mild, moderate 
or severe by [CONTACT_675394].   
 
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical 
condition which: 1. is fatal or life -threatening, 2. require s or prolong s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 3. results in persistent or significant dis ability/incapacity, 
4. constitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect, 5. is medically 
significant, in that it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  If any 
serious adver se events occur, the treatment status of the subject(s) may be 
revealed, as clinically indicated.  Subjects who discontinue medication use

5. INTRODUCTION (BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE)  
 
5.1 OAB Symptoms in PD  
 
Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease , behind  only 
Alzheimer disease. Prevalence is estimated  to be 0.3% of the general population and 1 -2% of 
the population over the age of 60  (de Lau 2006 , Kowal 2013 ). In 2005, 4 million people  
worldwide had PD , and that number is expected to more than double by 2030, t o 8.7 million  
(Dorsey 2007) . Estimates of p revalence in the [LOCATION_002] vary from 340,000 (Dorsey 2007) 
to 630,000 (Kowal 2013). Prevalence in the US is expected to nearly double by 2030, with 
estimates ranging from 610,000 (Dorsey 2007) to 1.06 million (Kowal 2013) by 2030, and an 
estimate of 1.34 million by 2050 (Kowal 2013).  
 
Urinary symptoms are common in PD . Prevalence estimates of lower urinary tract symptoms 
(LUTS) in PD range from 27% to 88% depending on severity threshold, screening tool, and 
sampling methods  (Araki 2000b, Sammour 2009, Winge 2006, Winge 2012) . LUTS include 
nocturia, urgency, frequency, and incontinence. LUTS increase morbidity  (Balash 2005)  and 
decrease quality of life (Araki 2000 a, Sammour 2009) in PD.  
 
Aside from the current study drug (Mirabegron) , other FDA -approved oral medications for 
OAB have an anticholinergic mechanism of action. Patients with PD are especially sensitive 
to cognitive side effects of anticholinergic medications because they, by [CONTACT_675395], have a significant cholinergic deficit. In addition, because of autonomic involve ment 
in PD, these patients have a high rate of constipation, another symptom that may be 
significantly worsened by [CONTACT_675396].  
 
5.2 Pelvic Floor Exerc ises (PFE) in PD  
 
There is limited research of PFE in PD . These are  simple interventions that can be easily 
applied in a clinical setting (such as an educational video/handout).   One uncontrolled pi[INVESTIGATOR_460904] 20 patients with PD showed a significant impr ovement in epi[INVESTIGATOR_675387] -up after an 8 -week, 5 -visit course of PFE -based 
behavioral therapy (Vaughn 2011).  
 
This design will demonstrate the effects of PFE on OAB in PD through the placebo arm of the 
study.  Beca use PFE are possibly effective with virtually no risk, they are the preferred first -
line intervention, but their efficacy has not been rigorously demonstrated. In addition, 
Confidential**  Daniel J. Burdick, MD   Page 12 
Protocol DBPA -2013 -01; Mirabegron and PFE for OAB in PD;  version: 2.[ADDRESS_913145] received training in PFE and  be practicing them on their own .   
 
5.3 Mirabegron for OAB  
 
Adding mirabegron may yield greater results than PFE alone. Mirabegron is an FDA -
approved treatment for OAB that has not been studied in Parkinson disease (PD). Importantly, 
mirabegron has a novel mechanism of action, activating Beta -3 adrenergic receptors in 
detrusor muscles  (Chapple 2012) . It is therefore expected to  avoid anticholinergic side effects 
such as confusion, halluci nations, and constipation , to which  PD patients  are especially 
susceptible .  
 
In phase 3 clinical trials, mirabegron demonstrated efficacy in treating OAB symptoms in a 
general adult population. In a sample of 1978 patients, mirabegron 50 mg daily and 100 mg 
daily produced statistically significant improvements over placebo in the number of 
incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 24 hours and number of micturitions per 24 hours  (Khullar 2013) . 
Incidence of adverse events (AEs) in the groups receiving mirabegron was not s ignificantly 
different from AEs in a group receiving tolterodine ER 4 mg daily  (Khullar 2013) . This 
substantiated an earlier study ( Chapple 2012) that found equivalent treatment effects and AE 
profile when comparing mirabegron 50 mg and 100 mg to tolterodi ne ER 4 mg in a sample of 
2444 patients. This study was not placebo -controlled.  Mirabegron efficacy was similarly 
demonstrated in a sample of 1329 patients (Nitti 2013), wherein  mirabegron [ADDRESS_913146] starting dose of mirabegron is 25 mg daily (Prescribing Information, Astellas 
Pharma, Inc.). A higher dose of 50 mg daily is also approved for use, and titration to this dose 
will be allowed at the mid -point of the trial (after 5 weeks), as it is likely that some patients 
will respond better to the higher dosage.  
 
6. STUDY OBJECTIVES

7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
7.1 Overall Study Design  
 
This study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 10 -week study of mirabegron as 
add-on therapy to an educational intervention of behavioral modification including pelvic 
floor exercise (PFE) in a cohort of 40 PD subjects over the age of 30 with overactive bla dder 
(OAB). Active drug will be mirabegron 25mg daily with optional up -titration to 50mg daily at 
visit 3. . Subjects will be enrolled based on response to an overactive bladder questionnaire at 
baseline  –visit 2.  Voiding diaries (72-hr) will be utilized following screening  visit,  Phone 
visit [ADDRESS_913148] the time of each micturition 
and/or urgency epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], urine  volume with each void, any epi[INVESTIGATOR_162748],  and the 
severity of urgency  as measured by [CONTACT_675397] 
(OAB -SCS) : 1 = no urgency  (normal voiding);  2 = mild (could postpone voiding  for as long 
as necessary without fear of incontinence ); 3 = moderate (could  postpone voiding  for a short 
while without fear of  leakage ); 4= severe ( could not postpone, had to rush to the toilet ); 5= 
urgency incontinence (could not make it to the toilet without some leakage) .    
 
Diaries will also record pelvic floor exercises. The p rimary outcome measure will be mean 
daily OAB -SCS (summat ion of all urgency scores recorded at all voids throughout the 72hr 
diary recording  averaged over 3 days ), visit 4  vs. visit 2 -baseline.  This measure  accounts for 
both the frequency and the urgency components of OAB.  
 
The study is composed of 4 clinic vis its and 2 phone visits over the course of 11 -12 weeks.

7.2 Enrollment  
Subjects who may qualify for this study will be identified in the context of clinical care at the 
EvergreenHealth Neuroscience Institute . Such eligible patients may receive a copy of the 
informed consent  form (ICF) at the time of their clinic visit. Recruitment may also occur 
through local promotional opportunities , referrals from other area neurologists, urologists, 
EvergreenHealth Pelvic Health Rehab, and the Washington State Parkins on Disease Registry.  
Patients may contact [CONTACT_675398] a notice about the study on the Institute’ s website or other online postings. Subjects  
who are not established patients at Evergree nHealth  will be offered the chance to undergo a 
telephone screening using an institutional review board (IRB) approved telephone screening 
text.  Subjects will be requested to send pertinent outside medical records for chart review by 
[CONTACT_675399] a screening visit.  
 
7.3 Screening  (Visit 1)  
 
Visit 1 is the screening visit. At this clinic visit, patients will provide written, informed 
consent and be assessed for eli gibility (excluding those eligibility criteria requiring 
completion of the voiding diary). A history of the patient’s PD symptoms and LUTS will be 
taken, and the patient’s past medical history will be reviewed. Diagnosis of PD will be 
confirmed based on [LOCATION_006] PD Society Brain Bank criteria (Hughes 1992). Current medi cation 
list will be reviewed, and a levodopa -equivalent daily dose will be calculated based on the 
patient’s current PD medication list and on published conversion factors (Tomlinson 2010). 
Eligible subjects will have a stable PD medication regimen for [ADDRESS_913149] 14 days prior to the screening visit.  The patient’s 
history of medication allergies will be reviewed.  
 
Physical examination will be performed, both a general medical examination  including vital 
signs  and a neurological examination . Neurological exam will  includ e MDS -UPDRS part 3 
evaluation  and modified Hoehn and Yahr (HY) staging of PD ( Goetz 2004 ). Post-void 
residual  (PVR)  will be assessed. Laboratory testing will include CBC, CMP , and urinalysis  
(U/A) by [CONTACT_675400].  Pre-menopausal women will have 
urine hCG measured.  
 
The voiding diary will be dispensed to the patient  and training will be provided o n how to 
complete the diary , including instruction on how to meas ure void volume . The PowerPoint 
presentation  of pelvic floor exercises will also be shown to the patient and each patient will be 
provided a copy to take home.

testing is ind icated, urine hCG will be measured.  
 
7.7 Unscheduled Visits  
 
Subjects may return to the clinic for safety evaluation or to receive additional study 
medication as needed. Unscheduled visits will include a review of concomitant medications 
and any adverse effects, and, if needed in the estimation of the study physicia n, physical 
examination in whole or in part.

study visits through the final visit. Every patient has the right to discontinue study 
participation at any time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the 
discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, or admi nistrative reasons. Criteria for 
early termination include, but are not limited to , < 36 hours of time covered in a bladder diary, 
poor adherence to study medication (less than 70% of study medication consumed),  loss of 
health insurance coverage,  and safet y issues related to study -related or non -study related 
adverse events.  
 
If a patient has a clinical necessity to alter their standard PD medications, the patient will be 
withdrawn from the trial so that changes may be made , except that occasional addition al doses 
of carbidopa/levodopa will be allowed if needed to address periodic worsening of 
parkinsonian symptoms . Additional doses of carbidopa/levodopa taken during the 72 -hour 
diary periods will be recorded in the diary. If a patient is withdrawn due to a n adverse event, 
the event will be followed, when possible, until resolution.  Patients who withdraw from the 
study may be replaced, but withdrawn patients will not be re -entered into the study.  
 
All data generated up to the time of discontinuation from the  study will be analyzed and the 
reason(s) for discontinuation will be recorded.  
 
8.4 Screen failures / Rescreening  
 
Subjects who screen fail because they do not  meet inclusion criteria or because of certain 
exclusions, e.g. presence of urinary tract infection, may rescreen after  30 days at the discretion 
of the investigator.

topi[INVESTIGATOR_675390]:   
 
• Bladder health: What’s normal?  
• Bladder dietary irritants  
• Bladder retraining and urge delay techniques  
• Pelvic floor anatomy and function  
• How to perform a “ Kegel”  
• “Kegel” home exercise program  
• Pelvic floor exercises with functional activities  
• Maintaining your home exercise program  
 
Subjects will have the opportunity to ask the study physician follow -up questions  as needed.  
 
9.2 Investigational drug  
 
The study medication and matching placebo will be provided by [CONTACT_77818].  The active 
medication will be mirabegron 25  mg po daily from Baseline Visit  (Visit 2)  to Titration Visit  
(Visit 3) . At the Titration Visit , all patients who have tolerated mirabegron 25 mg daily (no 
adverse events on this dose) will be up -titrated to mirabegron [ADDRESS_913157] will dispense the active or placebo medication at randomization 
and again at the Titration Visit.  An extra 5 -day supply of medication will be provided for 
each study period to allow a window for scheduling of appointments.  
 
9.3 Randomization and Blinding  
 
Following confirmation of eligibility  at Visit 2 , an eligible patient will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_913158] to 
the research study staff from the research pharmacy (a separate locked room containing only 
research medications).  The investigating physician s, nurse and research coordinator will be 
blinded as to treatment arm until  the code is broken.  The randomization code may be broken 
by [CONTACT_675401] a medical emergency. The reasons for this will be documented 
carefully. The subjects will receive identical appearing active or placebo study medication 
tablets, with id entification known only to the research pharmacist.  
 
9.4 Concomitant T herapy  
 
All concomitant therapy will be documented.  Prohibited will be concurrent (defined as 
“within 14 days of screening”) use of antimuscarinics  listed in Appendix 3 : oxybutynin

concurrent use of thioridizine , flecainide, propafenone or Digoxin ; and intravesical botulinum 
toxin treatment w ithin the previous six months. Medication s that are likely to influence 
bladder function may not be initiated between s creening and study completion. They may be  
continued with n o dose changes during the stud y. 
 
9.5 Treatment Compliance  
 
Patients will be asked to return all unused medication and all medication bottles, including 
empty bottles, at each visit and at the end of the study and the quantity of returned medication 
will be documented.  
 
10. DESCRIPTION OF ASSESSMENTS  
 
10.1 Safety Monitoring  
 
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_675402] e vent (AE) reporting, physical examination, vital signs, 
laboratory evaluation, and evaluation of post -void residual.  
 
10.1.1 Physical Examination  
 
A general physical examination will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening Visit)  and Visit 4 
(Final Visit) . This  exam will include, at minimum, HEENT, heart, lungs, abdomen, 
musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. Subjects with a range of health conditions that may 
put the patient at risk for adverse outcomes will be excluded, as listed under Exclusion 
Criteria.  
 
10.1.2 Vital Signs  
 
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be measured at each clinic 
visit. Subjects with BP  > 165 systolic or > 100 diastolic  or those with HR > 100  will be 
excluded at screening or discontinue study medication  if this occurs while on study 
medication. However, they may complete other elements of the study.  
 
10.1. 3 Laboratory Evaluations  
 
All subjects will undergo baseline testing with CBC, CMP, and urinalysis by [CONTACT_675403].  Subjects with screening estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) < 60, or AST or ALT > 2x upper limit of normal will be excluded.  
 
10.1.4 Pregnancy Status

1). At Visits [ADDRESS_913160]-void Residual  
 
PVR  will be measured by a bladder scan after urination at Visits 1, 3, and 4. Subjects wi th 
PVR  > 200  mL will be excluded  at screening or will discontinue study medication if this 
occurs while on study medication.  Symptoms of urinary retention will be monitored 
throughout the study and may lead to early discontinuation of study me dication; how ever, 
such subjects  may complete other elements of the study.  
 
10.1. [ADDRESS_913161] of monitoring and recording all adverse events, 
including serious adverse events.  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, physical sign, or medical condition that emerges 
during the study or, if pre sent at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the 
suspected cause. Adverse events include adverse drug reactions, illness with onset during the 
study, exacerbations of pre -existing conditions or clinically significant changes in physical 
exami nation or significantly abnormal objective test findings. Medical conditions/diseases 
present before starting study treatment are only considered adverse events if they worsen after 
starting study treatment. All adverse events will be recorded and graded a s mild, moderate or 
severe by [CONTACT_675404] , 
outlined here:  
 
• MILD : An event that caus es transient or  minimal symptoms  and that does not 
interfer e with daily  activities.  
• MODERATE : An event that causes symptoms sufficient  to interfere with but not 
prevent daily  activities.  
• SEVERE : An event that prevents normal, everyday activities.  
 
Adverse events will also be classified by [CONTACT_675405] [INVESTIGATOR_675391], outlined here:  
 
• Definitely Unrelated : The AE is definitely not related to the drug. This designation is 
reserved for those events that  do not follow a reasonable temporal se quence following 
drug administration (e.g.  occur prior to study treatment ) or for those events that cannot 
be even remotely related to study participation.  
Confidential**  Daniel J. Burdick, MD   Page 22 
Protocol DBPA -2013 -01; Mirabegron and PFE for OAB in PD;  version: 2.0 April 23  2014  
 
 Page 22 • Unlikely related : There is no reasonable association between the study treatment and 
the suspected e vent and the event could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical 
state or other therapy administered to the patient.  
• Possibly related : The suspected AE may or may not follow a reasonable temporal 
sequence from study treatment administration but seems to be the type of reaction that 
cannot be dismissed as unlikely. The event could have been produced or mimicked by 
[CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or other therapy administered to the patient.  
• Probably related : The suspected AE follows a reasonable temporal s equence from 
study treatment administration, abates upon discontinuation of the treatment, and 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical 
state or other treatments . 
• Definitely related : The suspected AE follows a r easonable temporal sequence from 
study treatment administration, abates upon discontinuation of the treatment, and, if 
appropriate, resumes upon re -introduction of the treatment. Additionally, the suspected 
AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_675406]’s 
clinical state or other treatments . 
 
The princip al investigator and all other research staff  except the research pharmacist  will be 
blinded towards randomization of active drug versus placebo until after completion of study.   
 
10.1. 7 Serious Adverse Events  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that meets one of more of the following criteria:  
 
• Is fatal or life -threatening  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9613] a current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes  
 
If any SAE  occur s, the treatment status of the subject(s) may be revealed, as clinically 
indicated.  If a patient disc ontinues medication use due to an AE, the event will be followed, 
when possible, until resolution. No interim analysis of safety data is planned because the 
entire study will be conducted over [ADDRESS_913162] been recorded in 
published PD drug trials.  
 
10.1.7 .1 Serious Adverse Events Reporting  
 
The FDA will be informed of SAEs as  soon as possible or within 15 calendar days. In 
addition, the Investigator will n otify the FDA of any unexpected  fatal or life -threatening 
experience associated with the use of the drug as soon as possible, or within 7 calendar days, 
by [CONTACT_130153]. When the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_147758] a n SAE 
requires reporting to the FDA (unexpected and possibly related to study drug), the following 
actions will be taken:  
Confidential**  Daniel J. Burdick, MD   Page 23 
Protocol DBPA -2013 -01; Mirabegron and PFE for OAB in PD;  version: 2.0 April 23  2014  
 
 Page 23  
• Telephone the FDA  immediately (day of awareness)  in the c ase of reportable death or 
life-threatening events.  
• Complete FDA Form 3500.  
• Send  the completed Form 3500 to the FDA (preferably by [CONTACT_60839] 1 -800-FDA -0178) 
within  the timelines mentioned above.  
• Attach the photocopy of all examinations, medical notes and records related to the 
SAE and document the dates these were made. For laboratory re sults, include the  
laboratory normal ranges. For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], Admission H&P, Discharge Summary,  
Consultative reports, etc. could be very helpful. In the case of a fatal event, provide an  
autopsy report, when it becomes available.  
 
10.2 Efficacy Assess ments  
 
10.2.1 OAB -SCS 
 
The primary outcome measure will be the change in the mean daily Overactive Bladder -
Symptom Composite Score (OAB -SCS)  from baseline to  visit 4. . One of the secondary 
outcome measures will be the change in  the mean daily OAB -SCS from baseline to visit 3.  
The OAB -SCS requires subjects to record the severity of urgency of each micturition  over a 
72-hour period  as follows: 1 = no urgency  (normal voiding);  2 = mild (could postpone voiding  
for as long as  necessary without fear of incontinence ); 3 = moderate (could  postpone voiding  
for a short while without fear of  leakage ); 4= severe ( could not postpone, had to rush to the 
toilet ); 5= urgency incontinence (could not make it to the toilet without some leakage) . The 
total score is derived  by [CONTACT_675407] a [ADDRESS_913163], the OAB -SCS accounts for both frequency and 
urgency in OAB, and is therefore a more accurate assessment of OAB th an measurements of 
urgency alone (Starkman 2008).  Mean daily OAB -SCS is total 72 -hour score divided by 3. 
For incomplete days,  the daily  score will be adjusted to equal [( total score for the incomplete 
day / actual number of hours recorded) x  24 hours ] (Zinner 2005 ). 
 
10.2.[ADDRESS_913164] number of micturition 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_612183] 24h, number of incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 24h, and volume per micturition.  The 
change in these variables from baseline  to visit 3  and from baseline to visit 4 will be 
secondary outcome measures.  (The voiding diary will also record frequency of Kegel 
exercises  and PRN doses of carbidopa/levodopa , but th ese will be control s, not outcome 
measure s.) 
 
10.2.3 OAB -q 
 
The Overactive Bladder questionnaire  symptom severity scale  (OAB -q) measures the impact 
of bladder symptoms by [CONTACT_675408] a 6 -
Confidential**  Daniel J. Burdick, MD   Page 24 
Protocol DBPA -2013 -01; Mirabegron and PFE for OAB in PD;  version: 2.0 April 23  2014  
 
 Page 24 point scale. The questionnaire has been  validated for use in the general population  (Coyne 
2002) and in patients with Parkinson disease ( Iacovelli 2010 ).  
 
10.2.4 NMSS  
 
The NMSS is a validated rating scale of non -motor symptoms in Parkinson disease 
(Chaudhuri 2007). It rates the severity and frequency of 30 symptoms in 9 domains, includi ng 
3 symptoms of overactive bladder. The other domains it evaluates are cardiovascular, 
sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, 
gastrointestinal, sexual function, and miscellaneous (pain, sense of smell, change in weight, 
and excessive sweating). Severity is rated from 0 (none) to 3 (major source of distress) and 
frequency is rated from 1 ( rarely, <1/week ) to 4 (very frequent , at least daily ). The score on 
each item is the product of the severity and frequency ra tings. The total score for the NMSS is 
the sum of all item scores.   
 
10.2. 5 PPBC  
 
The PPBC asks patients to rate the severity of their bladder symptoms on a 6 -point scale, from 
“My bladder condition does not cause me any problems at all” to “My bladder co ndition 
causes me many severe problems.” This single -item, global measure has been validated for 
use in a general population with OAB (Coyne 2006).  
 
10.2. [ADDRESS_913165]’s Global Impression of Change will be assessed by [CONTACT_7939] a single question at 
visit 3 and visit 4. : “Since starting the study drug, how have your bladder symptoms 
changed ?” Answers will be on a 7 -point scale: 1 = much improved; 2 = somewhat improved; 
3 = minimally  improved; 4 = no change; 5 = minimally  worse; 6 = somewhat worse; and 7 = 
much worse.  
 
11. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Statistical analysis will be performed by a consulting statistician contracted with 
EvergreenHealth.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_913166] a hypothesis in a preliminary fashion and to assess for safety  in this population with a 
specific neurological disease . As such, a power calculation may be irrelevant. However, a 
small number of sub jects (e.g. less than 10 ) may cause significant sampling error to miss a 
treatment effect or common safety issue. Some entities that establish criteria for level of 
evidence consider a sample size of 20 subjects in each arm to be a minimum representative 
population to be considered for Class III or better classification of Level of Evidence.  
Therefore, a  sample size of 40 subjects is a reasonable number for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_162753].

11.2 Study Population  
 
The study population will include all patien ts who pass screening and undergo randomization. 
Data will be analyzed in an intent -to-treat fashion.  
 
11.3 Baseline and Demographic Characteristics  
 
The following characteristics will be summarized descriptively  for placebo and drug groups : 
• Demographics ( age, gender, race)  
• Parkinson disease characteristics  at baseline  (disease duration, date of onset, initial 
symptom , PD type [tremor -dominant or akinetic -rigid], modified Hoehn and Yahr 
stage in the ON state, and MDS -UPDRS part 3 score in the ON state ) 
• Levodopa -equivalent daily dose  (LEDD)  
• Other medications used for OAB  
 
11.4 Safety Analysis  
 
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] (study drug or placebo) and by [CONTACT_2715]. Changes in 
vital signs (BP, HR, RR) and changes in post -void residual will be analyze d to detect 
differences between active drug and placebo.   
 
11.5 Efficacy Analysis  
 
Outcome measures are described in section 10.2. A nalysis of primary and secondary outcome 
measures will include : 
• Summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) at 
baseline , visit 3  and visit 4  by [CONTACT_3148] .  
• Summary of % change from baseline to visit 3  and 4. 
• Significance testing  
 
The primary time points for all comparative measures will  be Baseline Visit  (Visit 2) , 
Titration Visit  (Visit 3)  and Final Visit  (Visit 4) . Outcome measures will be compared 
between groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or other method  as deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_675409] . Demonstration of  superiority will depend on 
achieving statistical significance for the primary endpoint. Level of significance will be 
defined as p  = 0.05. All statistical tests will be two -sided.

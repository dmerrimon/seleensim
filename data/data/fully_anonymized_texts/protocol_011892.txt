Title of Study:  
A Multicenter, Open -Label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long -term Safety and Efficacy of 
Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Who Have Completed a Prior Clinical 
Study with P atisiran  
Study Centers:  
This study will be conducted at multiple sites worldwide that have enrolled patients in a previous 
patisiran study.  
Objectives : 
To assess the safety and efficacy of long -term dosing with patisiran in transthyretin -mediated 
amyloidosis  (ATTR ) patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy  (FAP). 
Methodology:   
This is a multicenter, multinational, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have previously completed a patisiran study.  
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran  intravenously ( IV) 
once every 21  (±3) days for the duration of the study.   In order to maintain the every [ADDRESS_454286] visit (Day 0) in this study [ADDRESS_454287] every 30 
(±5) days .  Patients will also have visits at the clin ical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_454288] these 
efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites [CAS]”); these sites can also dose and 
manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites 
[PCS])”, while se nding the patients to the nearest CAS for their [ADDRESS_454289] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be continually 
assessed throughout the stud y for adverse events  (AEs) .  Unscheduled visits for study assessments may

n. Grip strength will be measured in triplicate using a dynamometer held in the dominant hand.  Every effort will be made to use the same device for a patient 
throughout the duration of the study.  Two assessments of the grip strength will be performed on separate days (1 assessment on each day).  The second 
(repeat) assessment must be conducted at least 24 hours (approximately) after the first assessment, but not more than [ADDRESS_454305] be completed without assistance from another person; ambulatory aids such as canes and 
walkers are permitted.  The time required for the patient to walk [ADDRESS_454306] will be performed 
on separate days (1 assessment on each day).  The second (repeat) assessment must be conducted at least 24 hours (approximately) but not more than [ADDRESS_454307] assessment. 
q. Examination will include visual acuity, visual fields, and slit-lamp evaluation. An electroretinogram may also be performed, as described in Section  9.1.6   
r. Optional skin biopsies will only be obtained if the patient had skin biopsies in the parent study and has provided separate informed consent for the skin 
biopsies in this study.  Each skin biopsy assessment will include 2 sets of tandem 3-mm skin punch biopsies (4 biopsies total), including 1 set of biopsies 
taken from the distal lower le g, when a patient’s clinical status allows, and [ADDRESS_454308] 3 months. 
t. Patients who are entering this study from a protocol that does not include the Norfolk QOL-DN questionnaire (eg, ALN-TTR02-003) do not have to 
complete this assessment. 
u. Patients entering this study from study ALN-TTR02-003, who were not previously participating in the cardiac subgroup, will be required to have an 
echocardiogram before dosing on Day 0. 
v. Serum samples for anti-drug antibodies will be collected as specified. 
w. Patisiran will be administered once every 21 (±3) days.  Every effort should be made to continue dosing from the parent study in the 21 (±3) day timeframe.  
Doses may be administered at the clinical site or , where applicable country and local regulations allow, at home by a healthcare professional trained in the 
protocol. 
x. Patients who are receiving patisiran infusions at home must be contact[CONTACT_364520] a minimum of every 30 (±5) days for assessment of adverse

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 18 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
Transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a hereditary , autosomal domina nt, systemic 
disease caused by a mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene leading to the extracellular 
deposition of amyloid fibrils containing both mutant and wild type (WT) TTR.1,2 The particular  
TTR mutation and site of amyloid deposition determines the clinical manifestations of the 
disea
se, which includ e sensory and mot or ne ur opathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or 
cardiomyopathy.  ATTR is a progressive disease associated with severe morbidity, with a life 
expectancy limited to 5 to 15 years from symptom onset.3 There are over 100 reported TTR 
mutations which are 
associated with 2 clinical syndromes: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy 
(FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC).4,5,[ADDRESS_454316] common causative mutation of FAP is TTR Val30Met
(V30M), with the onset of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_192106] 30 and 55 years of age.9
Reduction of circulatin g a
myloidogenic TTR improve s 
outcomes in patients with FAP.  
Orthotopic liver transplantation, which eliminates mutant TTR from the circulation, has 
improved survival in early stage FAP patients.10  The TTR tetramer stabilizer tafamidis
(Vyndaqe l®) was approved in t he Eur opean Union (E U) for the treatme nt of s tage 1 FAP based 
on evidenc e that it ma y slow neuropath y pro gression in the se pa tients, but has not been approved 
for use in other regions of the world.  Diflunisal, a gene
ric, nonsteroidal anti-inflammator y drug 
(NSAI D) that is also a tetra mer stabil izer, exhibit s slowi ng of neuropath y progression in FAP 
patients, but is not standa rdly used amon g pra cti
tione rs.  Thus, ther e remai ns an unmet medical 
need for a potent a nd e
ffecti ve ther apy for FAP that will have an impac t on patients across a 
broad ran ge of neurolog
ic impairment, regardle ss of their mut ation. 
1.2. Patisiran 
Patisiran (the Intern
ati
onal Nonproprietary Name [INN] name [CONTACT_364607]-TTR02) is a novel investigational agent being developed for the treatment of ATTR 
patients with symptomatic FAP.  Patisiran comprises a small interfering ribonucleic acid 
(siRNA) which is specific for TTR, and is formulated in a hepatotropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
for intravenous (IV) administration.11 It is designed to significantly suppress liver production of  
both WT and all mutant forms of TTR, thereby [CONTACT_364521] c
linical benefit to patients with FAP. 
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of patisiran were 
evaluated in a serie
s of in vitro and in vivo studies that have enabled chronic dosing in clinical 
studies.  A summary of the nonclinical data can be found in the patisiran Investigators Brochure 
(IB). 
In a Phase 1 study of patisiran in healthy volunteers (Study ALN-TTR02-001), patisiran was 
g
enerally well tolerated.  Significant pharmacology in terms of TTR protein lowering (>80% 
reduction from pretreatment baseline) was observed at doses ≥0.15 mg/kg .  TTR levels showed 
evidence of recovery at Day 28 and return to baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 70.  A Phase 1 study in healthy 
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol Version 3.0 (Amendment 2) 05 January 2017 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 19 subjects of Japanese origin (Study ALN-TTR02-005) also showed dose dependent reduction in 
serum TTR, similar to that observed in Study ALN-TTR02-001 in Caucasian subjects; patisiran 
was safe and well tolerated up to 0.3 mg/kg.  An open-label Phase 2 multiple ascending dose 
study of patisiran in ATTR patients with FAP (Study ALN-TTR02- 002) was conducted to 
determine the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a 60 or 70 mi nute IV 
infusion of patisiran administered once every 3 o r 4 weeks for 2 doses.  The top dose of 
0.3 mg/kg administere d every 3 or 4 weeks was found to be generally sa fe and well tolerated, 
with maximum TTR knockdown of ~90% and sustained TTR suppression of >80% most 
consis tently observed with every 3 week dosing .  Twenty seven of the 29 patients treated on the 
Phase 2 trial enrolled in an ope
n-label extension study (ALN-TTR02-003) to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of long-term dosing with patisiran for approximately [ADDRESS_454317] been ge
nerally safe and well-tolerated on the -003 study, with preliminary data 
indicating no ch
anges in liver function tests, rena l function, or hematolog ic parameters, and no 
treatment-related discontinuations.  Sustained suppression of serum TTR of >80% has been 
observed in the open-label extension study, and preliminary clinical data at 6 months showed 
evidence for disease stabilization.12  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
stud
y of patisiran (ALN-TTR02-004; APOLLO) is ongoing worldwide.  The main objectives of 
the study are to demonstrate the clinical effic
acy of patisiran and to establish the safety of 
chronic dosing in ATTR patients with FAP.  Further details on the clinical studies of patisiran 
can be found in the patisira n Investigator’s Brochure . 
1.3. Study Design Rati
onale 
This is a multicenter, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran. 
The nonclinical data and clinical experience with patisiran support the continuation of patisiran 
treatment in this long-term extension study for ATTR patients with FAP.  All patients will 
receive patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV every [ADDRESS_454318] completed a 
prior study with patisiran (provided they meet the eligibility criteria of this study), including 
those previously on placebo, to receive open-label patisiran.  Patients coming on to this open-
label study from a blinded study will remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment until 
at least database lock has occurred in that study.  The duration of the study has been determined 
to allow the collection of long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy data of patisiran in patients 
with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  The estimated duration of the study 
is [ADDRESS_454319] that lower ing of the 
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol Version 3.0 (Amendment 2) [ADDRESS_454320] the clinical course of the disease.  Based on 
nonclinical and clinical data that showed suppression in levels of WT and mutant TTR upon 
administration of 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every [ADDRESS_454321] a clinical benefit in FAP patients with mild to moderate polyneuropathy and that 
further study is warranted.  
In completed and ongoing clinical studies (ALN-TTR02-001, ALN-TTR02-[ADDRESS_454322]-
TTR02-003), single and multiple doses of patisiran have been generally well tolerated.  Potential 
risks of patisiran include the following:  
Infusion-Related Reactions
Infusion-related reaction
s (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain biological
agents such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the potential for an
IRR with patisiran, all patients in this study will be premedicated prior to dosing with
patisiran.  The step-wise infusion regimen over approximately 70 minutes (starting with a
slower infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes before increasing
to 3 m
L/minute for the remainder of the infusion), may further reduce the risk of an IRR.
Liver function test abnormalities
In preclinical studies, patisira
n-related increased serum liver markers and histopathology in
the liver were observed at dosages > 0.1 mg/kg in rats and > 1.0 mg/kg in monkeys.  In
gen
eral, all of the findings were not observed or were observed at lower severity at the end of
the 60-[ADDRESS_454323] been  no clinically significant  change s in liver function tests  in
either the single- dose or multiple -dose studies. Patients in the study are monitored for liver
function via serial laboratory assessments.
Vitamin A Lowering
The suppre ssion of serum levels of TTR and retinol binding prote in (RBP) is expected to  
result in the lowe ring of circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical and clinical data have 
shown that the lowe ring of circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does 
not result in severe vitamin A deficiency.  Furthermore, there are individuals with RBP/TTR 
mutations who have life-long low levels of circulating vitamin A and are essentially in good 
health, suggesting that there are compensatory transport mechanisms for vitamin A that are  
yet undescribed.[ADDRESS_454324]

The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term dosing with patisiran 
in ATTR patients with FAP. 
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02)  ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 3.0 (Amendment 2) [ADDRESS_454327] completed “parent” study ALN-TTR02-[ADDRESS_454328]-TTR02-003 is not being conducted in Japan.  
C
onsented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran IV once 
e
very [ADDRESS_454329] a window of ± [ADDRESS_454330] visit (Day 0) on this study [ADDRESS_454331] 60 minutes before the start of the patisiran infusion .  Patisiran will be 
a
dministered as a 70-minute IV infusion (approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15-minutes 
followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion).  If the infusion 
duration for a patient was lengthened beyond 70 minutes due to the occurrence of an IRR while 
on the parent study, that infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular 
pa
tient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the 
Medic
al Monitor. 
After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site for patisiran dosing once every 
21 (±3) days.  Where applicable country and local regulations allow,  patients may receive the 
pa
tisiran infusions at home by a healthcare professional trained on the protocol and delivery of 
premedications and patisiran.  Patients who are receiving patisiran infusions at home will have a 
phone
 contact [CONTACT_364522] 30 (±5) days.  Patients will also have visits at the 
c
linical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_454332] these efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites 
[CAS]”); these sites can dose and manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and 
mana
ge the patients (“Patient Care Sites [PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS 
for their 52-week efficacy assessments.  Every effort should be made for the patient to return to 
the sa
me CAS center that the patient went to in the parent study.  Yearly efficacy assessments

c
ontinually assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs).  Unscheduled visits for study 
a
ssessments may occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518]. 
3.2. Number of Patients 
All patients who have previously completed a patisiran study may be enrolled if they meet the 
eligibility criteria for this study. 
3.3. Treatment Assignment 
All patients enrolled in this study will receive open-label patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV 
once every 21 (±3) days. 
The Investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_344354] (IRS) (via phone 
or
 web) after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria.  The patient will then be assigned a patient number that corresponds to their 
curre
nt patient number on the parent study.  A combination of the center number, parent study 
number
, enrollment number, and patient initials will create the unique patient identifier.  In 
countries with regulations prohibiting the use of patient initials, a strategy consistent with local 
regulations will be used to generate replacement values for the patient initials. 
3.4. Criteria for Study Termination 
The study may be terminated if patisiran does not obtain marketing approval or the development 
of patisiran is no longer being pursued by [CONTACT_1034] (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc). 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
a
ny time.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all 
documentation and patisiran supplied for the study must be returned to the Sponsor or Medpace, 
a
nd the Investigators, Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) / Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the 
decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure appropriate therapy 
and follow-up.

Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without penalty to 
their continuing medical care.  For those patients who withdraw, every effort will be made to 
de
termine their reason for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248], and to complete the Early Withdrawal visit. 
The
 Investigator may withdraw a patient from the study if the patient: 
 I s in violation of the protocol 
 Ex periences a serious or intolerable AE 
 B ecomes pregnant 
 R equires a prohibited medication (see Section 5.2) 
 R equests to be withdrawn from the study 
 I s found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol-required patisiran dosing 
visits 
The Investigator will withdraw patients from the study upon the request of the Sponsor, 
including
 if the Sponsor terminates the study.  Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, 
the 
Investigator will confer with the Sponsor before discontinuing the patient. 
Mi
ssing an occasional dose of patisiran will not necessarily result in the patient being withdrawn 
fr
om the study.  However, if a patient misses [ADDRESS_454339] and on the case report form (CRF). 
In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study, the clinical research organization (CRO)

and non-human primate ( NHP )  toxicology studies including a chronic NHP study in sexually 
mature animals, where there were no adverse effects in males (including sperm analyses and 
spermatogenic staging) or females.  In a dose range-finding rat embryo/fetal development study 
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02)  ALN-TTR02- 006

or fetal development despi[INVESTIGATOR_364488] (-88% from baseline) in serum vitamin A in the dams 
dosed with the rat-specific TTR surrogate siRNA. 
Women of child-bearing potential are defined as any woman or adolescent who has begun 
menstrua
tion. A post-menopausal woman is defined as a woman who has 12 months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels 
>40 mIU/mL or [ADDRESS_454341] dose of patisiran in this study.  
Hig
hly effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year).  
Acceptable forms of effective contraception are defined as follows: 
 Hor monal:  established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal 
methods of conception 
 P lacement of an intrauterine device (IUD) 
 P lacement of an intrauterine system (IUS) 
 Mec hanical/barrier method of contraception:  condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault cap) in conjunction with spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or 
supposi
tory) 
Note:  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not 
highly effective forms of contraception.  Therefore the use of additional spermicides 
does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  However, spermicides 
alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073].  
Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be 
used alone. 
 S urgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post-vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient); 
 S exual true abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Patients should be instructed to use [ADDRESS_454342] 
above.  Examples of 2 forms of highly effective contraception are as follows:  
 Or al, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives in conjunction with 
condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
 I UD in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
 Surgical sterilization of partner in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and 
spermicide

All packaging, labeling, and the preparation of patisiran will be in compliance with Good 
Manu
facturing Practice (GMP) specifications, as described in the Manufacture of Investigational 
Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_454345] is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 5.5 mL.  Th e 
c
ontainer closure system consists of a [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia 
(USP/EP) Type I borosilicate glass vial, a Teflon-faced butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium 
flip-off cap. 
6.2. Study Drug Storage 
Patisiran will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5 ± 3oC .  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions must be reported to the CRO and/or the Sponsor and use of 
the patisiran  halted until authorization for its continued use has been give n by [CONTACT_95346].  
No spe
cial procedures for the safe handling of patisiran are required.  A Sponsor representative 
or
 designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, 
and records.  
Patisiran supplied for this study may not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. 
6
.3. Study Drug Preparation 
Staff at each clinical site or the healthcare professional administering patisiran will be 
re
sponsible for preparation of patisiran doses, according to procedures detailed in the P harmacy 
Manual.  
All patients in this study will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days (± 3 days).  The 
amount (mg) of patisiran to be administered will be based on the patient’s body weight (kg) .  For 
e
ach dose administered, the weight obtained during the previous dosing visit will be used to 
calculate the dose of patisiran.  In the event that the weight obtained on the previous dosing day 
is not
 available, the weight obtained pre-dose on the current dosing day can be used for dose 
calculation.  Patients who weigh 105 kg or more will receive patisiran dosing based on an 
a
ssumption of a body weight of 104 kg. 
Patisiran will be prepared under aseptic conditions.  The total amount to be infused into each 
pa
tient at each dosing visit will be 200 mL.  Sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be added to a 
sterile infusion bag, and the calculated volume of patisiran will be withdrawn from the vials and 
inj
ected into the infusion bag. 
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol Version 3.0 (Amendment 2) [ADDRESS_454346] 60 minutes before the infusion: 
I
ntravenous dexamethasone (10 mg) or equivalent
Or
al paracetamol/acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent
Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2
blocker dose)
Intravenous H1 blo
cker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker
available at the
 clinical site).  Hydroxyzine 25 mg per os (PO, orally) or fexofenadine
30 mg or 60 mg PO or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient who
doe
s not tolerate IV diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker.
Further details (including a table of equivalent premedications) can be found in the patisiran 
Pharmacy Manual. 
Patients will be started on the above premedication regimen.  However, modifications may be 
made
 to the premedication regimen after consultation with the medical monitor either due to a 
pa
tient’s inability to tolerate one or more of the premedications or to the occurrence of IRRs 
unresponsive to slowing of the infusion rate. 
If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the steroid premedication regimen (e.g., patient
de
velops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status, or other complication), then
lowering of the steroid premedic
ation may be allowed for that patient after consultation with
the medical monitor.
If after consultation with the medical monitor, it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid
pr
emedication will be lowered, then the following steps m ust be followed :
1) If the current steroid dosage is 10 mg or less of intravenous dexamethasone or
e
quivalent, then the patient may be lowered in increments no greater than 2.5 mg
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent.
2) After each incremental lowering of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, the patient
must
 receive three consecutive intravenous doses of patisiran without IRR and continued
sig
ns or symptoms of steroid intolerance before further reductions in steroid
premedications.
3) The premedication steroid dosage should not be reduced below 5 mg intravenous
dexamethasone or equivalent.
Alternatively if a patient experiences an IRR when 10 mg or less of IV dexamethasone 
or equivalent is used as the steroid premedication, then proceed to Section 6.4.3. 
If a patient’s pre
medication regimen was modified prior to enr ollment in Study TTR02-006, the 
patient may continue on that modified premedication regimen.

Patisiran will be administered under the supervision of the site personnel every 21 (±3) days.  
Patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_454347] patisiran administered at home, where 
applicable country and local regulations allow.  Home administration of patisiran will be done by 
a healthcare professional trained on the protocol and delivery of premedications and patisiran. 
On a
ll dosing days, patisiran will be administered as a 70-minute IV infusion (approximately 
1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder 
of
 the infusion). 
If the patie
nt experiences an IRR the infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the
event of a mild or moderate 
IRR.
1) If the patient experiences a mild or moderate IRR that resolves by [CONTACT_364527].
2) If the patient experiences a severe IRR, then patisiran administration will not be resumed  
until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor (see Section  6.4.3).
If the infusion time for a patient was already extended on the parent study due to an IRR, that
modified infusion duration may be
 continued on this study for that particular patient.
Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70  minutes will require a discussion with the
M
edical Monitor.
For the first 3 infusions of patisiran on this study, the patient’s infusion site should be
assessed for signs of an
y localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the
end of the infusion, and the patient will remain at the clinical site for 1 hour following
completion of dosing.
If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will 
be
 considered missed and not administered. 
Additional details can be found in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual. 
I
n addition to study treatment, patients will receive the recommended daily allowance of 
vit
amin A .  Patients will receive this daily dose for the duration of their participation in the 
stud
y while being administered patisiran.  In Japan the clinical sites will provide the subjects 
with a 
prescription for vitamin A..

patisiran.  If the infusion is delayed, the administration of the infusion should be completed 
no more than 6 hours from the initial start of the infusion.   
 P atisiran administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe IRR until the 
case is discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
 I f after consultation with the Medical M onitor it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid 
premedication will be increased then the following steps are r ecommended : 
1) If the IRR occurred while the patient received [ADDRESS_454348] 60 minutes before the infusion and/or 5 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent the night before the intravenous infusion.  
2) Increased dose of premedication steroids should NOT exceed the combination of 20 mg 
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent on the day of infusion and 8 mg oral 
de
xamethasone or equivalent taken the night before the infusion.  
3) If the IRR occurred while the patient received less than 10 mg intravenous 
dexamethasone or equivalent, then the patient should return to the prior dose of 
int
ravenous dexamethasone or equivalent that did not result in an IRR. 
Patients will be instructed to call the Investigator if they experience symptoms such as fever, 
chills, myalgia, or nausea/vomiting after discharge from the site.

A sa
mple for INR assessment will be collected. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Screen 
Urine pregnancy tests are to be performed for all women of child-bearing potential.  The timing 
of the tests is specified in in Table 1; additional testing may be done any time pregnancy is 
suspec
ted. 
9.1.6. Op hthalmology Examination 
Ophthalmology examinations will include assessment of visual acuity, visual fields, and slit-
lamp evaluation.  Visual acuity should be evaluated at the beginning of each specified visit in the 
stud
y (ie, prior to slit-lamp examination).  Manifest refraction will be performed at each 
spec
ified visit before visual acuity testing and will be used to obtain a correction for visual acuity 
evaluations.  Visual acuity testing should be done with best (most recent) correction. 
An e
lectroretinogram (ERG) is a test to evaluate the retinal response to light.  It is done to 
de
termine if there is damage to rods and cones.  ERG testing should be performed if visual

9.1.7. Colu mbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) will be used to assess each patient's 
mental status as it relates to suicidal ideation and behavior. 
9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
9.2.1. De finition of Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Disease progression (including worsening of neuropathy impairment) will not be considered an 
AE. 
All IRRs will be recorded as AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event 
A serious AE (S AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:

Clinical Protocol  Version 3.0 (Amendment 2) 05 January 2017 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 44  Results in death 
 I s life-threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred; it does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death) 
 R equires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 R esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 I s a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 An importa nt medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192109] (eg, such events 
include allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions, or the development 
of drug dependency or abuse) 
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
Causal relationship assessment to drug treatments is required for purposes of reporting AEs.  To 
promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration along with 
good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the relationship of drug treatments to an 
AE: 
Definitely Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible. 
Possibly Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information 
on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikel
y Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, 
chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology. 
9.4. Recording Adverse Events 
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC). 
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other findings. 
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below. 
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02)  ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 3.0 (Amendment 2) 05 January 2017 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 45 Mild: Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
da
ily activity. 
Moderate: Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
daily activity. 
Severe: Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity. 
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of 
an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
[ADDRESS_454360] be fully recorded in the site’s source records and in the patients’ CRF, whether or 
not t
hey are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE should be described in detail: onset time 
and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
Adverse events should be followed through the end of study visit or until recovery to the normal 
state
 has been achieved, whichever occurs first.  In the event of a patient not returning to the 
clinical unit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost to follow-up. 
For patients who withdraw from the study early, ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution 
or [ADDRESS_454361].  SAEs will be followed by [CONTACT_364529]. 
9.5.1. S erious Adverse Event Reporting 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the above seriousness criteria (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) must be 
reported immediately to the CRO, always within [ADDRESS_454362] the following information: 
 P atient’s study number  
 De scription and date of onset of the event 
 Criterion for serious 
 Preliminary assignment of causality

9.5.2. P regnancy Reporting 
A female patient must have a negative pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_454366] dose of patisiran, the Investigator should report 
the pregnancy to the CRO within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the 
pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form.  Treatment with patisiran will be 
disconti
nued in any patient who is found to be pregnant during the study.  The patient should 
receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the 
possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723].  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), then the Investigator should follow the 
procedures for reporting an SAE outlined above. 
Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a patient participating in the study should also be reported 
to the Investigator, who will then report this to the CRO and follow to outcome as described 
above.

14.1. Case Report Forms 
The Investigator and designees agree to maintain accurate CRFs and source documentation as 
part of these case histories.  Source documents are the originals of any documents used by [CONTACT_364539][INVESTIGATOR_307]/institution that allow verification of the existence of the patient and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected during the trial. 
The Sponsor will supply CRFs for each patient.  Case report forms must be completed only by 
[CONTACT_364540].  Corrections must be made so as not to obliterate original 
data and must be identified and dated by [CONTACT_364541].  All data entered 
into the CRF must also be available in the source documents.  The Investigator will allow 
designated Sponsor representatives and regulatory bodies to have direct access to the source 
doc
uments to verify the data reported in the CRFs. 
Each completed CRF must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_192164] a timely 
manner.  The completed CRF will be the records maintained by [CONTACT_1034] .  A copy of the CRF 
will remain in the Investigator’s files.  
14.2. Confidentiality 
The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ anonymity will be maintained.  On the CRFs or 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_364542], but by [CONTACT_192172].  If patient names are included on copi[INVESTIGATOR_364492], the names (except for initials) will be 
obli
terated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for 
submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintained by [CONTACT_144759]. 
Following the principles of the GCP, if local regulations specify a patient’s number and initials 
will be used to identify the patient on their study records.  Laboratory samples may be labeled 
with an independent numbering code, and the label will not contain any other personal 
identification information.  The numbering code associated with these labels will be held by [CONTACT_364543], thereby [CONTACT_192174].  The 
number
ing code will also be held for samples in storage until marketing approval of patisiran in 
the countries where this study was conducted, or until clinical development of patisiran is halted.  
Throughout sample collection, storage (limited, staff only access area containing locked sample 
storage, and limited access sample tracking) and processing, the samples will only be handled by 
[CONTACT_192175]’s stan dard operating procedures. 
The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compi[INVESTIGATOR_144668], whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor  must approve 
any transfer of information not directly involved in the study.

S
igns and symptoms of an infusion-related reaction (IRR) usually develop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
Signs/symptoms may include: allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever), arthralgia 
(joint pain), bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, dyspnea (shortness of breath), fatigue (asthenia, 
lethargy, malaise), headache, hypertension, hypotension, myalgia (muscle pain), nausea, 
pruritus/itching, rash/desquamation, rigors/chills, sweating (diaphoresis), tachycardia, urticaria 
(hives, welts, wheals), vomiting. 
Categorization of IRRs is as follows: 
 
Categorization  Description  
Mild  Mild reaction:  infusion may be continued; if intervention is indicated 
it is minimal and additional treatment (other than paracetamol for 
delayed reactions) is not required.  
Moderate  Moderate reaction:  requires treatment including more intensive 
therapy  (eg, IV fluids, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug 
[NSAIDs]) in addition to infusion interruption but responds promptly 
to medication.  Treatment is indicated for ≤24 hours.  
Severe  More than moderate reaction:  not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_364495]; and/ or prolonged (treatment is indicated 
for >24 hours); recurrence of severe symptoms following initial 
improvement.

ALN -TTR02    Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_454381]- TTR02 -006 Protocol Amendment 2 
Summary of Changes (dated 05 January 2017)  
compared to Protocol Amendment 1 (dated 08 September 2015) 
A Multicenter, Open -label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long- Term Safety and 
Efficacy of Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy who have 
Completed a Prior Clinical Study with Patisiran  
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to add the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS) to the study assessments, which was inadvertently left out of previous versions of the 
protocol. The inclusion of the C-SSRS addresses a regulatory requirement to prospectively 
assess suicidality in clinical tria ls involving all drugs for neurological indications.  Overall, this 
amendment includes the following changes: 
• The Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale has been added as an assessment of suicidal 
ideation and behavior. 
• Country-specific versions of the protocol have been integrated in order to increase consistency in the execution of the clinical study globally 
• Electroretinograms are now recommended to be performed in the case of suspected 
retinal disease. 
• The premedication regimen has been updated to align with commercially available doses.  
• Blood samples for long-term storage have been added in order to permit future exploratory investigations. 
• During scheduled phone contact, clinical sites may now ask patients who are receiving 
home infusions about their g eneral experience receiving these infusions 
A detailed summary of the above changes, in addition to changes made for clarity, is provided in Table 1.  Corrections to abbreviations, typographical errors and formatting are not detailed.

Safety:  
Safety assessments will include monitoring for AEs  (including serious AEs  [SAEs]); clinical 
laboratory tests, including hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis , and pregnancy testing ; 
measurement of anti- drug antibodies (if clinically indicated); vital signs; physical examinations; and 
ophthalmology examinations. 
Statistical methods:  
This is an open-label extension study enrolling patients who have previously completed a patisiran 
study; the size of the study is not determined via power analysis of particular hypotheses tests.  
Efficacy analyses will examine between - and within- subject rates of  change over time.  For the subset 
of patients that have previously received placebo  in the parent study, comparisons for the various 
efficacy assessments will be made between rates of change pre- and post-administration of patisiran, 
and relative to the t reatment group in the parent study.  Additional exploratory analyses will compare 
rates of change with rates estimated from previous studies, including cross- sectional, natural history, 
and interventional studies of other drugs.  Associations between pharm acodynamic and efficacy data 
will be explored via correlation.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical efficacy data, clinical laboratory data, vital signs 
data, and ECG interval data, presented as both actual values and changes from baseline relative to each on -study evaluation.  Laboratory shift tables from baseline to w orst values will be presented.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  18 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
Transthyretin -mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant, systemic 
disease caused by a mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene leading to the extracellular 
deposition of amyloid fibrils containing both mutant and wild type (WT) TTR.1,2 The particular 
TTR mutation and site of amyloid deposition determines the clinical manifestations of the disease, which include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy.  AT TR is a progressive disease associated with severe morbidity, with a life 
expectancy limited to 5 to 15  years from symptom onset.
3 There are over 100 reported TTR 
mutations which are associated with 2 clinical syndromes: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy  
(FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC).4,5,[ADDRESS_454421] common causative mutation of FAP is TTR Val30Met 
(V30M), with the onset of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_192106] 30 and 55 years of age.9 
Reduction of circulating amyloidogenic TTR improves outcomes in patients with FAP.  Orthotopic liver transplantation, which eliminates mutant TTR fr om the circulation, has 
improved survival in early stage FAP patients .
10  The TTR tetramer stabilizer tafamidis 
(Vyndaqel®) was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of stage 1 FAP based on evidence that it may slow neuropathy progression in these patients, but has not been approved for use in other regions of the world.  Diflunisal, a generic, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that is also a tetramer stabilizer , exhibits slowing of neuropathy progression in FAP 
patients, but is not standardly used among practitioners.  Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for a potent and effective therapy for FAP that will have an impact on patients across a 
broad range of neurologic impairment, regardless of their mutation. 
1.2. Patisiran  
Patisira n (the International Nonproprietary Name [INN] name [CONTACT_364609] -TTR02) is a novel investigational agent being developed for the treatment of ATTR 
patients with symptomatic FAP .  Patisiran comprises a small interfering ribon ucleic acid 
(siRNA) which is specific for TTR, and is formulated in a hepatotropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
for intravenous (IV) administration.11 It is designed to significantly suppress liver production of 
both WT and all mutant forms of TTR, thereby [CONTACT_364552].  
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of patisiran were 
evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies that have enabled ch ronic dosing in clinical 
studies.  A summary of the nonclinical data can be found in the patisiran Investigators Brochure (IB).  
In a Phase 1 study of patisiran in healthy volunteers (Study ALN- TTR02 -001), patisiran was 
generally well tolerated .  Significant pharmacology in terms of TTR protein lowering (>80% 
reduction from pretreatment baseline) was observed at doses ≥0.15 mg/kg .  TTR levels showed 
evidence of recovery at Day [ADDRESS_454422] s of Japanese origin (Study ALN- TTR02 -005) also showed dose dependent reduction in

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  [ADDRESS_454423]- TTR02 -001 in Caucasian subjects; patisiran 
was safe and well tolerated up to 0.3 mg/kg.  An open- label Phase 2 multiple ascending dose 
study of patisiran in ATTR patients with FAP (Study ALN -TTR02 -002) was conducted to 
determine the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a 60 or 70 minute IV 
infusion of patisiran administered once every 3 or 4 weeks for 2 dos es.  The top dose of 
0.3 mg/kg administered every 3 or 4 weeks was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, with maximum TTR knockdown of ~90% and sustained TTR suppression of >80% most consistently observed with every 3 week dosing.  Twenty seven of  the 29 patients treated on the 
Phase 2 trial enrolled in an open-label extension study (ALN- TTR02 -003) to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of long -term dosing with patisiran for approximately [ADDRESS_454424] been generally safe and well -tolerated on the -003 study, with preliminary data 
indicating no changes in liver function tests, renal function, or hematologic parameters, and no treatment -related discontinuations.  Sustained suppression of serum TTR of >80% has been 
observed in the open- label extension study, and preliminary clinical data at 6 months showed 
evidence for disease stabilization.
12  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study of patisiran (ALN- TTR02 -004; APOLLO) is ongoing worldwide.  The main objectives of 
the study are to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of patisiran and to establish the safety of 
chronic dosing in ATTR patients with FAP.  Further details on the clinical studies of patisiran 
can be found in the patisiran IB. 
1.3. Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study designed  to evaluate the long -term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  
The nonclinical data and clinical experience with patisiran support the continuation of patisiran treatment in this long -term extension study for ATTR patients with FAP.  All patients will 
receive patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV every [ADDRESS_454425] completed a 
prior study with patisiran (provided they meet the eligibility criteria of this study), including those previously on placebo, to receive open- label patisiran.  P atients coming on to this open-
label study from a blinded study will remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment until 
at least database lock has occurred in that study.  The duration of the study has been determined 
to allow the collection of lo ng-term safety, tolerability and efficacy  data of patisiran in patients 
with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  The estimated duration of the study is [ADDRESS_454426] the clinical course of the disease.  Based on

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol   Versio n 2.0  (Amendment 1)  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  20 nonclinical and clinical data that showed suppression in levels of WT and mutant TTR upon 
administration of 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every [ADDRESS_454427] a clinical benefit in FAP patients with mild to moderate polyneuropathy and that 
further study is warranted.  
In completed and ongoing clinical studies (ALN- TTR02 -001, ALN- TTR02 -[ADDRESS_454428]-
TTR02 -003), single and multiple doses of patisiran have be en generally well tolerated.  Potential 
risks of patisiran include the following:  
• Infusion- Related Reactions  
Infusion- related reactions (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain biological 
agents such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the potential for an 
IRR with patisiran, all patients in this study will be premedicated p rior to dosing with 
patisiran .  The step -wise infusion regimen over approximately 70 minutes (starting with a 
slower infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes before increasing to 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion), may further reduce the risk of an IRR. 
• Liver function test abnormalities   
In preclinical studies, patisiran -related increased serum liver markers and histopathology in 
the liver w ere observed at dosages > 0.1 mg/kg in rats and > 1.0 mg/kg in monkeys.  In 
general, all of the findings were not observed or were observed at lower severity at the end of 
the 60-[ADDRESS_454429] been  no clinically significant  changes in  liver function tests  in 
either the single -dose or multiple -dose studies. Patients in the study are monitored for liver 
function via serial laboratory assessments.  
• Vitamin A Lowering  
The suppression of serum levels of TTR and RBP is expected to result in the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical and clinical data have shown that the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does not result in severe vitamin A 
deficiency.  Furthermore, there are individuals with RBP/TTR mutations who have life- long

Clinical Protocol   Versio n 2.0  (Amendment 1)  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  [ADDRESS_454433] previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will e nroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran IV once 
every [ADDRESS_454434] a window of ± [ADDRESS_454435] visit (D ay 0) o n this study [ADDRESS_454436] 60 minutes before the start of the patisiran infusion .  Patisiran will be 
administered as a 70 -minu te IV infusion (approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 -minutes 
followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion).  If the infusion 
duration for a patient was lengthened beyond 70 minutes due to the occurrence of an IRR while on the parent study, that infusion duration may  be continued on this study for that particular 
patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site for patisiran dosing once every 
21 (±3) days, or receive the patisiran infusions at home by a healthcare professional trained on 
the protocol and delivery of premedication s and patisiran .  Patients who are receiving patisiran 
infusions at home will have a phone contact [CONTACT_364522] 30 (±5) days.  Patients 
will also have visits at the clinical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_454437] these efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites 
[CAS]”); these sites can dose and manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and 
manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites [PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS for their 52- week efficacy assessments .  Every effort should be made for the patient to return to 
the same CAS center that the patient went to in the parent study .  Yearly efficacy assessments 
after the 52 -week visit may be done at a PCS.  Prior to starting the study, the CAS and PCS will 
create a delegation of responsibilities document tha t clearly details which site is responsible for

3.2. Number of Patients 
All patients who have previously completed a patisiran study may be enrolled if they meet the eligibility criteria for this study.  
3.3. Treatment Assignment  
All patients enrolled in this study will receive open -label patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV 
once every 21 (±3) days. 
The Investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_344354] (IRS) (via phone 
or web) after confirming that the  patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria .  The patient will then  be assigned a patient number that corresponds to their 
current patient number on the parent study.  A combination of the center number, parent study number, enrollment number, and patient initials will create the unique patient identifier.  In 
countries with regulations prohibiting the use of patient initials, a strategy consistent with local regulations will be used to generate replacement values for the patient initials.  
3.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study may be terminated if patisiran does not obtain marketing approval or the development of patisiran is no longer being pursued by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
any time.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all documentation and patisiran supplied for the study must be returned to the Sponsor  or its 
representative, and the Investigators, Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) / Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure

Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without penalty to 
their continuing medical care.   For those patients who withdraw, every effort will be made to 
determine their reason for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248], and to complete the Early Withdrawal visit.  
The Investigator may withdraw a p atient from the study if the patient:  
•Is in violation of the protocol
•Experiences a serious or intolerable AE
•Becomes pregnant
•Requires a prohibited medication (see Section 5.2)
•Requests to be withdrawn from t

•Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol-required patisiran dosingvisits
The Investigator will withdraw patient s from the study upon the request of the Sponsor, 
including if the Sponsor terminates the study.  Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, 
the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor before discontinuing the patient. 
Missing an occasional dose of patisiran  will not necessarily result in the patient being withdrawn

Highly effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year).  Acceptable forms of effective contraception are defined as follows:  
• Hormonal:  established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal 
methods of conception 
• Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Placement of an intrauterine system (IUS)  
• Mechanical/barrier method of contraception:  condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault cap) in conjunction with spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or 
supposit ory) 
Note:  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not highly effective forms of contraception.  Therefore the use of additional spermicides does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  However, spermici des 
alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073] .  
Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be used alone. 
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasecto my 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient); 
• Sexual true abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Patients should be instructed to use [ADDRESS_454447] above.  Examples of 2 forms of highly effective contraception are as follows:  
• Oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives in conjunction with 
condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• IUD in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• Surgical sterilization of partner in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide  
Interaction between patisiran  and hormonal contraceptives is not anticipated.  The patisiran drug

Solution for Injection contains 2 mg/mL of the TTR siRNA drug substance. 
5.2. Concomitant Medications  
Use of the following medications/treatments is prohibited during study participation: 
• Any investigational agent other than patisiran  
• Corticosteroids other than those administered as premedications prior to the dose of 
patisiran, those used to treat an infusion reaction, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_124374].  
However, for patients with chronic inflammatory disorders (eg, asthma, rheumatoid 
arthritis), systemically administered steroids may be permitted provided that: 1) the dose is <20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent if administered chronically, or 2) for 
doses ≥20 mg/day, administration is limited to no mor e than 5 consecutive days. 
Use of the medications/treatments listed below is permitted in patients who were already taking 
such medications while on the parent study in accordance with the rules of that study protocol.  
For patients who did not take these medications  while on the parent study, use of these 
medications is permitted, if necessary, only after the patient has completed the 52- week visit.  
• Tafamidis  
• Diflunisal 
• Doxycycline/TUDCA  
Medications and treatments other than those specified above, including palliative and supportive 
care approved by [CONTACT_364525]-related symptoms, are permitted during the study. 
All patients will be asked to continue to take an oral daily supplement containing the 
recommended daily allowance of vitamin A.  
Any concomitant medication or treatment that is required for the patient’s welfare may be given 
by [CONTACT_737].  Use of all concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded on the patient’s CRF through the end of the patient’s participation in the study.  This will include all prescription drugs, herbal preparations, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and 
minerals.  Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the CRF.

6.1. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and the preparation of patisiran will be in compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) specifications, as described in the Manu facture of Investigational 
Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_454450] is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 5.5 mL.  The container closure system consists of a [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia (USP/EP) Ty pe I borosilicate glass vial, a Teflon -faced butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium 
flip-off cap.  
6.2. Study Drug Storage  
Patisiran  will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5 ± 3oC.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions must be reported to the CRO and/or the Sponsor and use of the patisiran  halted until authorization for its continued use has been given by [CONTACT_95346].  
No special procedures for the safe handling of patisiran are required.  A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, 
and records.  
Patisiran  supplied for this study may not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. 
6.3. Study Drug Preparation  
Staff at each clinical  site or the healthcare professional administering patisiran  will be 
responsible for preparation of patisiran doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
All patients in this study will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days (± 3 days).  The 
amount (mg) of patisiran to be administered will be  based on the patient’s body weight (kg).  For 
each dose administered, the weight obtained during the previous dosing visit will be used to 
calculate the dose of patisiran .  In the event that  the weight obtained on the previous dosing day 
is not available, the weight obtained pre-dose on the current dosing day can be used for dose calculation.  Patients who weigh 105 kg or more will receive patisiran dosing based on an assumption of a body weight of 104 kg. 
Patisiran will be prepared under aseptic conditions.  The total amount to be infused into each 
patient at each dosing visit will be 200 mL.  Sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be added to a sterile infusion bag, and the calculated volume of patisiran  will be withdrawn from the vials and 
injected into the infusion bag.

•Intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg) or equivalent
•Oral paracetamol/acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent
•Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2
blocker dose)
•Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blockeravailable at the clinical  site).  Hydroxyzine or fexofenadine 25 mg per os (PO, orally)
or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient who does not tolerate IVdiphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker.
Further details (including a table of equivalent premedications) can be found in the patisiran  
Pharmacy Manual.  
Patients will be started on the above premedication regimen.   However, modifications may be 
made to the premedication regimen after consultation with the medical monitor either due  to a 
patient’s inability to tolerate one or more of the premedications or to the occurrence of IRRs unresponsive to slowing of the infusion rate. 
•If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the steroid premedication regimen (e.g., patient
develops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status , or other complication), then
lowering of the steroid premedication may be allowed for that patient after consultation withthe medical monitor.
•If after consultation with the medical monitor, it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroidpremedication  will be lowered, then the following steps must be followed :
1) If the current steroid dosage is 10 mg or less of  intravenous dexamethasone or
equivalent, then the patient may be lowered in increments no greater than 2.5 mgintravenous dexamethasone or equivalent.
2) After each incremental lowering of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, the patient
must receive three consecutive intravenous doses of patisiran without IRR and continued
signs or symptoms of steroid intolerance before further reductions in steroid
premedications.
3) The premedication steroid dosage should not be reduced below 5 mg intravenous
dexamethasone or equivalent.
Alternatively if a patient experiences an IRR when 10 mg or less of IV dexamethasone or 
equivalent is used as the steroid premedication, then proceed to Section  6.4.3. 
If a patient’s  premedicatio
n regimen was modified prior to enrollment in Study TTR02 -006, the 
patient may continue on that modified premedication regimen.

applicable country and local regulations allow.  Home administration of patisiran will be done 
according to a site -specific plan  by a healthcare professional trained  on the protocol and delivery 
of premedications and patisiran. 
On all dosing days, patisiran will be administered as a 70 -minute IV infusion (approxima tely 
1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3  mL/minute for the remain der 
of the infusion). 
•If the patient experiences an IRR the infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the
event of a mild or moderate IRR.
1) If the patient experiences a mild or moderate IRR that resolves by [CONTACT_364527].
2) If the patient experiences a severe IRR, then patisiran administration will not be resumed  
until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor (see Section 6.4.3).
•If the infusion time for a pat
ient was already extended on the parent study due to an IRR, that
modified infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular patient.
Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discus sion with the
Medical Monitor.
•For the first 3 infusions of patisiran on this study, the patient’s infusion site should beassessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the
end of the infusion, and the patient will remain at the clinical site for 1 hour following
completion of dos ing.
If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran  within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will 
be considered missed and not administered. 
Additional details  can be found in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual.  
In addition to study treatment, patients w ill receive  the recomme nded daily allowance of 
vitamin  A in  an oral supplement.

Criteria for categorizing IRRs are provided in Appendix 3. 
•In the event of an IRR, the infusion of patisiran may be stopped and the patient closely
monitored until resolution of the reaction.  Drugs that may be used to facilitate resolution and
permit resumption of pa tisiran administration include, but are not limited to:
paracetamol/acetaminophen (or equivalent), additional histamine H1/H2 receptor antagonists(eg, ranitidine), NSAIDs, adrenaline, supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and/or corticosteroids.
•Following resol ution of a mild or moderate IRR that required interruption of the patisiran
infusion, resumption of administration may occur at the Investigator’s discretion at a slowerinfusion rate (but not to exceed 3 hours) for that dose and for all subsequent doses of

no more than 6 hours from the initial start of the infusion.   
• Patisiran administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe IRR until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
• If after consultation with the M edical M onitor it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid 
premedication  will be increased then the following steps are recommended : 
1) If the IRR occurred while the patient received [ADDRESS_454453] 60 min utes before the infusion and/or 5 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent the night before the intravenous infusion.  
2) Increased dose of premedication steroids should NOT exceed the combination of 20 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent on the day of infusion and 8 mg oral dexamethasone or equivalent taken the night before the infusion.  
3) If the IRR occurred while the patient received less than 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, then the patient should return to the prior dose of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent that did not result in an IRR. 
Patients will be instructed to call the Investigator if they experience symptoms such as fever, chills, myalgia, or nausea/vomiting after discharge from the site.  
6.5. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
patisiran  supplied for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will be

evaluations.  Visual acuity testing sho uld be done with best (most recent) correction. 
Further details regarding the ophthalmology examinations will be provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
9.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Disease progression (including worsening of neuropathy impairment) will not be considered an 
AE. 
All IRRs will be recorded as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious AE (S AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death  from 
the event as it occurred; it does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol   Versio n 2.0  (Amendment 1)  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  43 • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192109] (eg, such events include allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions, or the development 
of drug dependency or abuse) 
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
Causal relationship assessment to drug treatments is required for purposes of reporting AEs.  To 
promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration along with good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the relationship of drug treatments to an 
AE: 
Definitely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clini cally plausible.  
Possibly Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative etiology.  
9.4. Recording Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC). 
In ad dition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other findings. 
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below.  
Mild:  Mild events are tho se which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
daily activity.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity .

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  [ADDRESS_454464] to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of 
an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
9.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported after the first 
dose of patisiran  regardless of their relationship to patisiran administration through the end of the 
study. 
Any medical condition that is present when the patient enters this extension study and does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it does deteriorate at any time during the study, it should be reported as an AE. 
All AEs must be fully re corded in the site’s source records and in the patients’ CRF, whether or 
not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE should be described in detail: onset time 
and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
Adverse events should be followed through the end of study visit or until recovery to the normal 
state has been achieved, whichever occurs first.  In the event of a patient not returning to the 
clinical unit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost to follow-up. 
For patients who withdraw from the study early, ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution 
or [ADDRESS_454465].  SAEs will be fo llowed by [CONTACT_364529]. 
9.5.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormal ity that
 meets the above seriousness criteria (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) must be 
reported imme diately to t he CRO, a lways w ithin

13.1. Ethics Review  
National regulations and International Conference on Harmonization ( ICH) require that approval 
be obtained from an IRB or an IEC prior to participation of patients in research studies.  Prior to 
the study onset, the protocol, any protocol amendments, informed consent forms (ICFs), and any 
other written information regarding this study to be provided to a patient or patient’s legal guardian must be approved by [CONTACT_4186]. 
All IRB and IEC approvals must be dated and contain IRB/IEC Chairman or designee 
authorization and must identify the IRB/IEC (eg, name [CONTACT_3816]), the clinical protocol by [CONTACT_364561]/or protocol number, and the date of approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_139611].  
No drug will be released to the site to dose a patient until written IRB/IE C authorization has been 
received by [CONTACT_16015].  
The Investigator is responsible for obtaining continuing review of the clinical research at least 
annually or more often if specified by [CONTACT_4186].  The Investigator must supply the Sponsor 
with written documentation of the approval of the continued clinical research. 
The Investigator will make all attempts to ensure that the IRB or IEC is constituted and operates 
in accordance with Federal and ICH GCP and any local regulations.  
13.2. Ethical Cond uct of the Study  
This study will be performed in accordance with the clinical trial agreement, the protocol, all 
applicable government laws, regulations, and guidances where the study is being conducted including policies with foundations in the World Health Organization (WHO) Declaration of 
Helsinki, the ICH of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human 
Use, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and all other applicable medical privacy laws and r egulations. 
13.2.1. Financial Disclosure Reporting Obligations  
Each Investigator (including Principal and any Sub Investigators) directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of study patients is required to provide financial disclosure information according to  all applicable legal requirements.  In addition, Investigators must commit to 
promptly updating this information if any relevant changes occur during the study and for a period of one year after the completion of the study.

be provided to the Sponsor.  Revisions to the ICF required during the study must be agreed upon, 
and a copy of the revised ICF provided to the Sponsor. 
At the time of recruitmen t, each prospective patient (or legal guardian) will be given a full 
explanation of the study and be allowed to read the ICF.  Once the Investigator is assured that the 
patient/legal guardian understands the commitments of participating in the study, the 
patient/legal guardian will be asked to sign and date the ICF.  A copy of the fully signed and dated ICF will be given to the patient.  The original ICF will be maintained in the patient’s 
medical record at the site.  All active patients will sign an update d ICF if revisions are made to 
the ICF during the course of the study. 
Prior to dosing in this study, the patient will sign and date the ICF and receive a copy of the 
signed ICF.  No study procedures should be performed before informed consent is obtained.  The

14.1. Case Report Forms  
The Investigator and designees agree to maintain accurate CRFs and source documentation as 
part of these case histories.  Source documents are the originals of any documents used by [CONTACT_192162][INVESTIGATOR_307]/institution that allow verification of the e xistence of the patient and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected during the trial.  
The Sponsor will supply CRFs for each patient.  Case report forms must be completed only by [CONTACT_192163].  Corrections must be made so as not to obliterate original 
data and must be identified and dated by [CONTACT_364541].  All data entered 
into the CRF must also be available in the source documents.  The Investigator will allow designated Sponsor representatives and regulatory bodies to have direct access to the source 
documents to verify the data reported in the CRFs. 
Each completed CRF must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_192164] a timely 
manner.  The completed CRF will be the records maintained by [CONTACT_1034].  A copy of the CRF 
will remain in the Investigator’s files.  
14.2. Confidentiality  
The Investigator m ust ensure that the patients’ anonymity will be maintained.  On the CRFs or 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_111242], but by [CONTACT_192172].  If patient names are included on copi[INVESTIGATOR_364492], the names (except for initials) will be 
obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintaine d by [CONTACT_144759]. 
Following the principles of the GCP, if local regulations specify a patient’s number and initials 
will be used to identify the patient on their study records.  Laboratory samples may be labeled 
with an independent numbering code, and the label will not contain any other personal 
identification information.  The numbering code associated with these labels will be held by [CONTACT_364563], thereby [CONTACT_192174].  The 
numbering code will also be held for samples in storage until marketing approval of patisiran in 
the countries where this study was conducted, or until clinical development of patisiran is halted.  Throughout sample collection, storage (limited, staff only access area containing locked sample 
storage, and limited access sample tracking) and processing, the samples will only be handled by 
[CONTACT_192175]’s standard operating procedures. 
The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compi[INVESTIGATOR_144668], whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor must approve 
any transfer of information not directly involved in the study. 
14.3. Inspection of Records  
The Sponsor will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of 
monitoring any aspect of the study.  The Investigator agrees to allow the Monitor to inspect the

Signs and symptoms of an infusion-related reaction (IRR) usually develop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  Signs/symptoms may include: alle rgic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever), arthralgia 
(joint pain), bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, dyspnea (shortness of breath), fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, malaise), headache, hypertension, hypotension, myalgia (muscle pain), nausea, prurit us/itching, rash/desquamation, rigors/chills, sweating (diaphoresis), tachycardia, urticaria 
(hives, welts, wheals), vomiting. 
Categorization of IRRs is as follows: 
 
Categorization Description  
Mild  Mild reaction:  infusion may be continued; if intervention is indicated 
it is minimal and additional treatment (other than paracetamol for delayed reactions) is not required. 
Moderate  Moderate reaction:  requires treatment including more intensive 
therapy (eg, IV fluids, nonsteroidal anti- inflammator y drug 
[NSAIDs]) in addition to infusion interruption but responds promptly 
to medication.  Treatment is indicated for ≤24 hours. 
Severe  More than moderate reaction:  not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_192114]; and/ or prolonged ( treatment is indicated 
for >24 hours); recurrence of severe symptoms following initial 
improvement.

  Version 2.0 (Amendment 1) Summary of Changes  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  [ADDRESS_454486]- TTR02 -006 Amendment 1 Summary  of Changes: 
Protocol Version 2.0 (Amendment 1), date d 08 September  2015, compared to Protocol 
Version 1.0 (Original Protocol), dated [ADDRESS_454487] been made to the following sections as indicated below; a rationale 
for the changes is also provided , followed by a detailed summary of changes. 
Modification of Premedication Regimen 
To date, per the ALN -TTR02-004/ALN-TTR02-006 protocol, patients in this study were to receive a 
premedication regimen that included 8 mg of dexamethasone or equivalent the night before and 20 
mg IV dexamethasone or equivalent the day of the infusion. Some patients on this premedication 
regimen for an extended amount of time in the ongoing Phase 2 open-label extension (OLE) study (Study ALN-TTR02-003) have reported recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_364501](s) reported as an infusion-related reaction (IRR) and/or related to the premedication dexamethasone.  In a prior Phase 2 multi-dose study (Study ALN-TTR02-002), a less intensive premedication regimen was tested, consisting of [ADDRESS_454488] -TTR02-002, the premedication regimen for the 9 patients in the OLE study 
(Study ALN-TTR02-003) who were experiencing post infusion flushing was reduced to include only 
10 mg dexamethasone on the day of infusion.  In addition, after discussion with the investigator two additional patients without flushing also received the lower dose of dexamethasone in the OLE study (Study ALN-TTR02-003).  These 11 patients in the OLE study  (Study ALN -TTR02-003) have been 
followed for a mean (range) of 6 (1-8) months on this less intensive premedication regimen and appeared to tolerate the infusions without any worsening or increased frequency of IRRs, and some reported less flushing. Based on this information, it is appropriate to change to the less intensive 
premedication regimen for patients in Study ALN-TT02-004/TTR02-006. 
In addition, after consultation with the medical monitor , specified patients who are intolerant of 10 mg IV 
dexamethasone or equivalent on the day of infusion may be considered for further step-wise reduction in 
dexamethasone or equivalent as specified in the protocol (See Protocol Section 6.4.1) . Alternatively, after 
consultation with the medical monitor, if the patient develops infusion related reactions on 10  mg IV  or 
less of dexamethasone, even after slowing of the infusion, that patient will be allowed to increase the 
steroid premeditation  dose in a step -wise manner as indicated per protocol (See Protocol Section 6.4.3). 
Clarification of Risk Benefit Assessment  
The risk benefit assessment has been updated to reflect liver function test abnormalities and risk for osteoporosis.  B ecause patients with FAP may be at risk for osteoporosis, it has been added that, if there 
is no medical contraindication, and per investigator judgment and local standard of care, study 
132
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)    Clinical Protocol ALN -TTR02 -006 
  Version 2.0 (Amendment 1) Summary of Changes  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  2 participants should, if appropriate, receive therapy for the prevention and early treatment of osteoporosis 
such as: calcium and vitamin D supplementation, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, 
estrogen agonist/antagonist or combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
Clarification of the Inclusion Criterion about Total Bilirubin 
The inclusion criterion about total bilirubin has been updated to be consistent with the inclusion critierion about total bilirubin in Study ALN -TTR02 -004.  Specifically the updated criterion states that patients 
must have total bilirubin within normal limits, but states that a patient w ith total bilirubin ≤ [ADDRESS_454489] is  
eligible if the elevation is secondary to  documented Gilbert’s syndrome (elevation of unconjugated 
bilirubin with normal conjugated bilirubin) and the patient has ALT and AST levels within normal 
ranges.  
Clarification about Ex clusion Criteri on about Uncontrolled C ardiac Arrhythmia and U nstable Angina  
This amendment also clarified  that patients with any uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or unstable angina 
are not permitted to enroll in the study (Exclusion Criterion #3) . Patients with uncontrolled clinically 
significant cardiac arrhythmia or unstable  angina were not permitted to enroll in this study in the previous 
version of the protocol; the change was made to remove the subjective determination of clinical significance from the criterion.  
Clarification about the Duration of the Study 
This amendment also clarified that the duration of the study was determined to allow the collection for long- term safety, tolerability, and efficacy data of patisiran.  
Additional Clarifications 
The following clarifications have also been made in this amend ment:  
• The collection of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is an efficacy assessment in Section 8.  
• Blood for serum vitamin A level will be collected before the administration of vitamin A 
supplementation (and not before patisiran administration because the se assessments are performed 
at non-dosing visits). 
• Magnetic resonance neurography is to be performed in the subset of patients who completed it in their parent study and may be performed for patients who did not complete it in their parent study.  
• The same examiner should perform the mNIS+7 and NIS+7 assessments at the We ek 52 visit as in 
the patient’s parent study.  
• All clinical laboratory samples will be processed by [CONTACT_2237].  
• Concomitant medications that continue from the parent study should be entered into the database. 
• Added INR  assessment as a safety laboratory assessment.  
• Added a 12- Week visit to collect samples for safety laboratory assessments . 
• Added to the Schedule of Events that inclusion and exclusion criteria are to be evaluated at the 
Day 0 Visit.  
• Separated the End of Study Visit and the Early Withdrawal Visits on the Schedule of Events.  
• Clarified study drug preparation.

  Amendment 1 Summary of Changes  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  5 Purpose:   To explore tolerability of patients with lower d examethasone in premedication regimen  
Primary change  (1 of 
3): Section 6.4.1 Premedication  
Formerly read:  Prior to dosing, patients will receive [ADDRESS_454490] set of premedications will be administered on the evening before patisiran administration as follows:  
• Oral dexamethasone (8 mg) or equivalent  
• Oral paracetamol/ acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent  
• Oral H2 blocker  (ranitidine 150 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2 blocker dose)  
• Oral H1 blocker, 10 mg cetirizine (hydroxyzine 25 mg, fexofenadine, or equivalent may be substituted if patient does 
not tolerate cetirizine)  
If the evening premedications (first s et) are missed, they should be administered a minimum of 6  hours before the second set (see 
below) of premedications on the day of dosing (ie, at least 7 hours before patisiran dosing).  
Prior to each dose of patisiran, patients will also  receive the following premedications (ie, second set) at least 60 minutes before the 
infusion:  
• Intravenous dexamethasone ( 20 mg) or equivalent  
• Oral paracetamol/acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent  
• Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2 blocker dose)  
• Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker available at the clinical site).  
Hydroxyzine or fexofenadine 25 mg per os (PO, orally) or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient who 
does not tolerate IV diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker.  
Further details (including a table of equivalent premedications) can be found in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual.  
Modifications to the premedication regimen may be allowed due to lack  of tolerability of one or more of the premedications by [CONTACT_4677] (eg, lowering of the corticosteroid dose if a patient develops uncontrolled hyperglycemia or altered mental status).  Such 
modifications may be allowed for that patient only after consultation with the Medical Monitor.  If the premedication regimen was 
already modified for this reason on the parent study, the modification for that particular patient will be carried over into this study.

Patients will be sta rted on the above premedication regimen.  However, modifications may be made to the premedication 
regimen after consultation with the medical monitor either due to a patient’s inability to tolerate one or more of the premedications or to the occurrence of IRRs unresponsive to slowing of the infusion rate.  
• If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the steroid premedication regimen (e.g., patient develops uncontrolled 
hyperglycemia, altered mental status, or other complication), then lowering of the steroid premedication may be allowed 
for that patient after consultation with the medical monitor.  
• If after consultation with the medical monitor, it is agree d that an individual patient’s steroid premedication will be 
lowered, then the following steps must be followed:  
1) If the current steroid dosage is 10 mg  or less of  intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, then the patient may be 
lowered in increments no greater than 2.5 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent.  
2) After each incremental lowering of  intravenou s dexamethasone or equivalent, the patient must receive three 
consecutive intravenous doses of patisiran without IRR and continued signs or symptoms of steroid intolerance before further reductions in steroid premedications.   
3) The premedication steroid dosage should not be reduced below 5 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent.  
Alternatively if a patient experiences an IRR when 10 mg or less of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent is used as the steroid premedication, the n proceed to Section 6.4.3.

Added Text:  Criteria for categorizing IRRs are provided in Appendix 3. 
• In the event of an IRR, the infusion of patisiran may be stopped and the patient closely monitored until resolution of the re action.  
Drugs that may be used to facilitate resolution and permit resumption of patisiran administration include, but are not limited to: 
paracetamol/acetaminophen (or equivalent), additional histamine H1/H2 receptor antagonists (eg,  ranitidine), NSAIDs, 
adrenaline, supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and/or corticosteroids.  
• Following resolution of a mild or moderate IRR that required interruption of the patisiran infusion, resumption of administration may occur at the Investigator’s discretion at a slower infusion rate (but not to exceed 3 hours) for that dose and for all su bsequent 
doses of patisiran.  If the infusion is delayed, the administration of the infusion should be completed no more than 6 hours from 
the initial start of the infusion.   
• Patisiran administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe IRR until the case is discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.  
• If after consultation with the Medical Monitor it is agreed that an individual patient’s steroid premedication will be 
increased then the following steps are recommended:  
1) If the IRR occurred while the patient received [ADDRESS_454492] 60 minutes  before the infusion and/or 5 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent the night before the intravenous infusion.  
2) Increased dose of premedication steroids should NOT exceed the combination of 20 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent on the day of infusion and 8 mg oral dexamethasone or equivalent taken the night before the infusion.  
3) If the IRR occurred while the patient received less than 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, then the patient should return to the prior dose of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent that did not result in an IRR.
 
Patients will be instructed to call the Investigator if they experience symptoms such as fever, chills, myalgia, or nausea/vo miting after

In completed and ongoing clinical studies (ALN -TTR02 -001, ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_454497] -TTR02 -003), single an d multiple 
doses of patisiran have been generally well tolerated.  Potential risks of patisiran include the following:  
• Infusion -Related Reactions  
Infusion -related reactions (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain biological agents such as liposomes or 
monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the potential for an IRR with patisiran, all patients in this study will be premed icated

• Liver function test abnormalities   
In preclinical studies, patisiran- related increased serum liver markers and histopathology in the liver were observed at

The suppression of serum levels of TTR and RBP is expected to result in t he lowering of circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical 
and clinical data have shown that the lowering of circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does not result in  
severe vitamin A deficiency.  Furthermore, there are individuals with RB P/TTR mutations who have life -long low levels of

Title of Study: 
A Multicenter, Open -Label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety and Efficacy of 
Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Who Have Completed a Prior Clinical 
Study with Patisiran
Study Centers:
This study will be conducted at multiple sites worldwide that have enrolled patients in a previous 
patisiran study.
Objectives:
To assess the safety and efficacy of long-term dosing with patisiran in  transthyretin-mediated 
amyloidosis (ATTR) patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP).
Methodology:
This is a multicenter, multinational, open -label extension study to evaluate the long- term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have previously completed a patisiran study.
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran intravenously ( IV)
once every 21 (±3) days for the duration of the study. In order to maintain the every 21- day dosing 
schedule from the parent study , patients are expected to have their first visit (Day 0) in this study [ADDRESS_454512] every 30 (±5) days. Patients will also have visits at the clini cal site 
at approximately [ADDRESS_454513] these 
efficacy assessments (referred to as “Centra l Assessment Sites [CAS]”); these sites can also dose and 
manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites
[PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS for their [ADDRESS_454514] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be continually 
assessed throu ghout the study for adverse events (AEs) .  Unscheduled visits for study assessments may 
occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518].

Safety:
Safety assessments will include monitoring for AEs (including serious AEs [SAEs]); clinical laboratory 
tests, including hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing; measurement of anti-
drug antibodies (if clinically indicated); vital signs; physical examinations; and ophthalmology 
examinations.
Statistical methods:
This is an open -label extension study enrolling patients who have previously completed a patisiran 
study; the size of the study is not determined via power analysis of particular hypotheses tests.
Efficacy analyses will examine between - and within-subject rates of change over time. For the subset 
of patients that have previously received placebo in the parent study, comparisons for the various 
efficacy assessments will be made between rates of change pre- and post-administration of patisiran ,
and relative to the treatment group in the parent study . Additional exploratory analyses will compare 
rates of change with rates estimated from previous studies, including cross -sectional, natural history, 
and interventional studies of other drugs.  Associ ations between pharmacodynamic and efficacy data 
will be explored v ia correlation.
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical efficacy data, clinical laboratory data, vital signs 
data, and ECG interval data, presented as both actual values and changes from baseline relative to each 
on-study evaluation.  Laboratory shift tables from baseline to worst values will be presented.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 181. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Disease Overview 
Transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant, systemic 
disease caused by a mutation in the transthyretin  (TTR) gene leading to the extracellular 
deposition of amyloid fibrils containing  both mutant and wild type (WT) TTR.1,2 The particular 
TTR mutation and site of amyloid deposition determines the clinical manifestations of the 
disease, which include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or 
cardiomyopathy.  ATTR is a progressive disease associated with severe morbidity, with a life 
expectancy  limited to 5 to 15 years from symptom onset.3 There  are over 100 reported TTR 
mutations which are  associated with 2 clinical syndromes: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy 
(FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy  (FAC).4,5,[ADDRESS_454538] common causative mutation of FAP is TTR Val30Met 
(V30M), with the onset of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_364502] 30 and 55 years of age.9
Reduction of circulating amyloidogenic T TR improves outcomes in patients with FAP.  
Orthotopic liver transplantation, which eliminates mutant TTR from the circulation, has improved survival in early stage FAP patients.
10 The TTR tetramer stabilizer tafamidis 
(Vyndaqel®) was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatme nt of stage 1 FAP based 
on evidence that it may  slow neuropathy  progression in these patients, but has not been approved 
for use in other regions of the world.  Diflunisal, a generic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that is also a tetramer stabilizer, exhibi ts slowing of neuropathy progression in FAP 
patients, but is not standardly used among practitioners.  Thus, there remains an unmet medical 
need for a potent and effective therapy for FAP th at will have an impact on patients across a 
broad range of neurologic impairment, regardless of their mutation. 
1.2. Patisiran 
Patisiran (the International Nonproprietary  Name [INN]  name [CONTACT_364609]-TTR02) is a novel investigational ag ent being developed for the treatment of ATTR 
patients with symptomatic FAP.  Patisiran comprises a small int erfering ribonucleic acid 
(siRNA) which is specific for TTR, and is fo rmulated in a hepatotropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
for intravenous (IV) administration.11 It is designed to significantly  suppress liver production of 
both WT and all mutant forms of TTR, thereby [CONTACT_364552]. 
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and tox icology of patisiran were 
evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies that have en abled chronic dosing in clinical 
studies.  A summary of the nonclinical data can be found in the patisiran Investigators 
Brochure (IB). 
In a Phase 1 study of patisiran in healthy volunteers (Study ALN-TTR02-001), patisiran was 
generally well tolerated.  Significant pha rmacolo
gy in terms of TTR protein lowering (>80 % 
reduction from pretreatment baseline) was observed at doses ≥0.15 mg/kg .  TTR levels showed 
evidence of recovery at Day
 28 and return to baseline by  [CONTACT_2006]

165
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02-006
Clinical Protocol Version 1.0 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 19subjects of J apanese origin (Study ALN-TTR02-005) also showed dose d ependent reduction in 
serum TTR, similar to that observed in Study ALN-TTR02-001 in Caucasian subjects; patisiran 
was safe and well tolerated up to 0.3 mg/kg.  An open-label Phase 2 multiple ascending dose 
study of pa
tisiran in AT TR patients with FAP (Study ALN-TTR02-002) was conducted to 
determine the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a
 60 or 70 minute I
V 
infusion of patisiran administered once every 3 or 4 weeks for 2 doses.  The top dose of 
0.3 mg/kg administere d every 3 or 4 weeks was found to be generally s afe and well tolerated, 
with maximum TTR knockdown of ~90%
 and sustained TTR suppression of >80% most 
consistently observed with every 3 week dosing.  Twenty seven of the 29 patients treated on the 
Phase 2 trial enrolled in an open-label extension study ( ALN-TTR02-003) to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of long-term dosing with patisiran for approximately [ADDRESS_454539] b een generally sa fe and we ll -tolerated on the -003 stud y, with preliminary data 
indicating no ch anges in liver function tests, re nal function, or hematolog ic parameters, a nd no 
treatment-related discontinuations.  Sustained suppressi on of serum TTR of >80% has been 
observed in the open-label extension study , and p
reliminary  
clinica l data at 6 months showed 
evidence for disease stabilization.12 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study of patisiran (AL
N-TTR02-004; APOLLO) i s ongoing worldwide.  The main objectives of 
the stud
y are to demonstrate the clinical efficacy o f patisiran and to establish the safety of
 
chronic dosing in ATTR patients with FAP.  Further details on the clinical studies of patisiran 
can be found in the p atisiran IB. 
1.3. Study Design Rationale 
This is a multicenter, open-label extension study desig ned to evaluate the long-term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran. 
The nonclinical data and clinical experie nce with patisiran support the continuation of patisiran 
treatment in this long-term extension study for A TTR patients with FAP.  All patients will 
receive patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV  every [ADDRESS_454540] completed a 
prior study with patisiran (provided they meet the eligibility criteria of this study), including 
those previously on placebo, to receive open-label patisiran.  Patients coming on to this open-
label study from a blinded study will remain blind ed to their previous treatment assignment until 
at least database lock has occurred in that study.  This study will allow patients to receive 
treatment with patisiran until it  becomes commercially available in their region, or until the study 
is otherwise terminated by [CONTACT_1034]. 
1.4. Risk-Benefit Assessment 
Please see the IB for an expanded risk/benefit assessment. 
1.4.1. Infusion-Related Reactions 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain biological 
agents such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the potential for an IRR 
with patisiran, all patients in this study will be premedicated prior to dosing with patisiran or 
166
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02-006
Clinical Protocol Version 1.0 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 20placebo.  The step-wise infusion  regimen over approximatel y 70 minutes (starting with a slower 
infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/minute fo r the first 15 minutes before increasing to 
3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion), ma y further reduce the risk of an IRR. 
1.4.2. Vitamin A Lowering 
The suppression of serum levels of TTR and RB P is expected to result in the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical and clinical data have shown that the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does not result in severe vitamin A 
deficiency.  Furthermore, there are individuals with RBP/TTR mutations who have life-long low 
levels of circulating  vitamin A and are essentially  in good health, suggesting  that there are 
compensatory  transport mechanisms for vitamin A that are yet undescribed.[ADDRESS_454541] tissues continuing  in the absence of RBP.14 Provided 
there is adequate vitamin A in the diet, tissue stores of vitamin A should not be affected by [CONTACT_364566].  However, as the vitam in A content of the diet may vary between 
different countries and different individuals within a country, all patients on the study will be 
asked to take continue taking daily supplement containing the recommended daily allowance of 
vitamin A.

administration (or at least 6 hours before the seco nd set of premedications on the day of dosing).  
The second set of premedications will be administ ered at least 60 minutes before the start of the 
patisiran infusion.  Patisiran will be administered as a 70-minute IV infusion (approximately 
1 mL/minute for the first 15-minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder 
of the infusion).  If the infusion duration for a patient was lengthened beyond 70 minutes due to 
the occurrence of an IRR while on the parent study, that infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site fo r patisiran dosing once every 
21 (±3) days, or receive the pati siran infusions at home by a healthcare professional trained on 
the protocol and delivery of premedications and patisiran.  Patients who ar e receiving patisiran 
infusions at home will have a phone contact [CONTACT_364522] 30 (±5) days.  Patients 
will also have visits at the clinical site at approxim ately [ADDRESS_454546] these efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites 
[CAS]”); these sites can dose and manage patients. There will also be sites that can dose and 
manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites [PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS 
for their 52-week efficacy assessments.  Every effort should be made for the patient to return to 
169
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02-[ADDRESS_454547] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be 
continually assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs).  Unscheduled visits for study 
assessments may occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518]. 
3.2. Number of Patients 
All patients who have previously comple ted a patisiran study may be enrolled if they meet the 
eligibility criteria for this study. 
3.3. Treatment Assignment 
All patients enrolled in this study will receive ope n-label patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV 
once every 21 (±3) days. 
The Investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_344354] (IRS) (via phone 
or web) after confirming that the patie nt fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria.  The patient wil l then be assigned a patient number that corresponds to their 
current patient number on the parent study.  A combination of the center number, parent study number, enrollment number, and patient initials will  create the unique patient identifier.  In 
countries with regulations prohibiting the use of patient initials, a strategy consistent with local regulations will be used to generate replacement values for the patient initials. 
3.4. Criteria for Study Termination 
The study may be terminated if patisiran does not obtain marketing  approval or the development 
of patisiran is no longer being pursued by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the s tudy for clinical or administrative reasons at 
any time.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all 
documentation and patisiran supplied for the stud y must be returned to the Sponsor or its 
representative, and the Investigators, Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) / Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the decision.  The Investiga tor should promptly inform th e patients and assure 
appropriate therapy and follow-up.

4.3. Patient Withdrawal Criteria 
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without penalty to 
their continuing medical care.  For those patients who withdraw, every effort will be made to 
determine their reason for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248], and to complete the Early Withdrawal visit. 
The Investigator may withdraw a patie nt from the study if the patient: 
/g120Is in violation of the protocol 
/g120Experiences a serious or intolerable AE 
/g120Becomes pregnant 
/g120Requires a prohibited medication (see Section 5.2) 
/g120Requests to be withdrawn from the study 
/g120Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol-required patisiran dosing 
visits 
The Investigator will withdraw patien ts from the study upon the request of the Sponsor, 
including if the Sponsor terminates the study.  Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, 
the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor before discontinuing the patient. 
Missing an occasional dose of patisiran will not necessarily result in the patient being withdrawn 
from the study.  However, if a patient misses [ADDRESS_454552] and on the case report form (CRF). 
In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study, the clinical research organization (CRO) 
Medical Monitor must be informed immediately.

Requirements 
TTR transports vitamin A in plasma; therefore, re ductions in circulating vitamin A levels 
accompany reductions in TTR caused by [CONTACT_364570] n.  Vitamin A deficiency has known effects on 
both male and female reproductive performance and embryo/fetal development.[ADDRESS_454553] been conducted in the rat 
and non-human primate (NHP) toxicology studies including a chronic NHP study in sexually 
mature animals, where there were no adverse ef fects in males (including sperm analyses and 
spermatogenic staging) or females.  In a dose range-finding rat embryo/fetal development study 
conducted with patisiran, there were no effec ts on mating, fertility, ovarian or uterine parameters,

In this study, women of child-bearing potential must  have a negative pregnancy test, cannot be 
breastfeeding, and must be using [ADDRESS_454554] dose of patisiran in this study.  
Highly effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year).  
Acceptable forms of effective contraception are defined as follows: 
/g120Hormonal:  established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal 
methods of conception 
/g120Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) 
/g120Placement of an intrauterine system (IUS) 
/g120Mechanical/barrier method of contraception:  condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault cap) in conjunction with spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or 
suppository) 
Note:  Failure rates indicate that, when use d alone, the diaphragm and condom are not 
highly effective forms of contraception .  Therefore the use of additional spermicides 
does confer additional theoretical contrace ptive protection.  However, spermicides 
alone are inefficient at preventing preg nancy when the whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073].  
Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier  method of contraception and should not be 
used alone. 
/g120Surgical sterilization of male partne r (with the appropriate post-vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient); 
/g120Sexual true abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Patients should be instructed to use [ADDRESS_454555] above.  Examples of 2 forms of highl y effective contraception are as follows:  
/g120Oral, implantable, injec table, or transdermal contr aceptives in conjunction with 
condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
/g120IUD in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
/g120Surgical sterilization of partner in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 306. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS AND MANAGEMENT 
6.1. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling 
All packaging, labeling, and the preparation of patisiran and placebo will be in compliance with 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) specificati ons, as described in the Manufacture of 
Investigational Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_454558] is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 5.5 mL.  The 
container closure system consists of a United Stat es Pharmacopeia/Europe an Pharmacopoeia 
(USP/EP) Type I borosilicate glass vial, a Teflon-f aced butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium 
flip-off cap. 
6.2. Study Drug Storage 
Patisiran will be stored upright and ref rigerated at approximately 5 ± 3oC.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions must be reported to the CRO and/or the Sponsor and use of 
the patisiran halted until authorization for its continued use has been given by [CONTACT_95346].
No special procedures for the safe handling of  patisiran are required.  A Sponsor representative 
or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, 
and records.Patisiran supplied for this study may not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. 
6.3. Study Drug Preparation 
Staff at each clinical site or the healthca re professional administering patisiran will be 
responsible for preparation of patisiran doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy 
Manual.
All patients in this study will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days (± 3 days).  The 
amount (mg) of patisiran to be administered will be based on the patient’s body weight (k g). For 
each dose administered, the we ight obtained during the previous dosing visit will be used to 
calculate the dose of patisiran.  In the event that the weight obtained on the previous dosing day 
is not available, the weight obtained pre-dose on the current dosing day can be used for dose 
calculation.  Patients wh o weigh 105 kg or more will receive patisiran dosing based on an 
assumption of a body weight of 104 kg. 
Patisiran will be prepare d under aseptic conditions. 
177
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02-[ADDRESS_454559] set of premedications will be administered on the evening before 
patisiran administration as follows: 
/g120Oral dexamethasone (8 mg) or equivalent 
/g120Oral paracetamol/ acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent 
/g120Oral H2 blocker (ranitidine 150 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2 
blocker dose) 
/g120Oral H1 blocker, 10 mg cetirizine (hydro xyzine 25 mg, fexofenadine, or equivalent 
may be substituted if patient does not tolerate cetirizine) 
If the evening premedications (first set) are mi ssed, they should be administered a minimum of 
6 hours before the second set (see below) of prem edications on the day of dosing (ie, at least 
7 hours before patisiran dosing). 
Prior to each dose of patisiran,  patients will also receive the following premedications (ie, second 
set) at least 60 minutes before the infusion: 
/g120Intravenous dexamethasone (20 mg) or equivalent 
/g120Oral paracetamol/acetam inophen (500 mg) or equivalent 
/g120Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2 
blocker dose) 
/g120Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker 
available at the clinical site).  Hydroxyz ine or fexofenadine 25 mg per os (PO, orally) 
or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted fo r any patient who does not tolerate IV 
diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker. 
Further details (including a table of equivalent pre medications) can be found in the patisiran 
Pharmacy Manual. 
Modifications to the premedication regimen may be allowed due to lack of tolerability of one or 
more of the premedications by [CONTACT_102] (eg, lowering of the corticosteroid dose if a patient 
develops uncontrolled hyperglycemia or altered mental status).  Such modifications may be 
allowed for that patient only after consultation with the Medical Monitor.  If the premedication 
regimen was already modified for this reason on the parent study, the modification for that 
particular patient will be carried over into this study. 
6.4.2. Study Drug Administration 
Patisiran will be administered under the supervision of the site personnel every 21 (±3) days.  
Patients who have received at l east [ADDRESS_454560] patisiran administered at home, where 
178
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02-006
Clinical Protocol Version 1.0 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 32applicable country and local regulations allow.  Home administration of patisiran will be done 
according to a site-specific plan by a healthcare pr ofessional trained on the protocol and delivery 
of premedications and patisiran. 
On all dosing days, patisiran will be administer ed as a 70-minute IV infusion (approximately 
1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder 
of the infusion). The infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the event of a mild or moderate IRR; 
patisiran administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe IRR until the case 
is discussed with the Medical Monitor (see Section 6.4.3).  If the infusion time for a patient was 
already extended on the parent study due to an IRR, that modified infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 
[ADDRESS_454561] 3 infusions of 
patisiran on this study, t he patient’s infusion site should be as sessed for signs of any localized 
reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes afte r the end of the infusion , and the patient will 
remain at the clinical site for 1 hour following completion of dosing. 
If a patient does not receive a dose of pati siran within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will 
be considered missed and not administered. 
Additional details can be found in th e patisiran Pharmacy Manual. 
In addition to study treatment, patients will receive the recommended daily allowance of 
vitamin A in an oral supplement. 
6.4.3. Suggested Guidelines for Manageme nt of Infusion-Related Reactions 
Criteria for categorizing IRRs are provided in Appendix 3. 
In the event of an IRR, the infusion of pati siran may be stopped and the patient closely 
monitored until resolution of the reaction.  Dr ugs that may be used to facilitate resolution and 
permit resumption of patisiran administration include, but are not limited to: 
paracetamol/acetaminophen (or equivalent), a dditional histamine H1/H2 receptor antagonists 
(eg, ranitidine), NSAIDs, adrenaline, supplementa l oxygen, IV fluids, and/or corticosteroids. 
Following resolution of a mild or moderate IRR that required interruption of the patisiran 
infusion, resumption of administration may occur at  the Investigator’s discretion at a slower 
infusion rate (but not to exceed 3 hours) for that dose and for all subsequent doses of patisiran.  If 
the infusion is delayed, the administration of the infusion should be completed no more than 
6 hours from the initial start of the infusion.  Patisiran administra tion will not be resumed for any 
patient following a severe IRR until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
Patients will be instructed to call the Investiga tor if they experience symptoms such as fever, 
chills, myalgia, or nausea/vomiting after discharge from the site. 
6.5. Study Drug Accountability 
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate  records of receipt and the condition of the 
patisiran supplied for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will be 
kept of the weight used to calculate each dispense d patisiran dose, and when and how much 
179
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02-[ADDRESS_454562] also be recorded. 
Drug accountability records and inventory will be av ailable for verification by [CONTACT_95346]. 
Further instructions about drug accountability ar e detailed in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual. 
6.6. Study Drug Handling and Disposal 
All used, partially used, and unused vials of patisiran will be returned to the Sponsor or its 
specified designee/depot or destroyed at th e site according to applicable regulations. 
Patisiran supplied for this study must not be used for  any purpose other than the present study.  
Drug that has been dispensed for a patient and returned unused must not be redispensed.

9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
9.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a pa tient or clinical investigational patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporal ly associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Disease progression (including worsening of neuropa thy impairment) will not be considered an 
AE. 
All IRRs will be recorded as AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event 
A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
/g120Results in death 
/g120Is life-threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred; it does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death) 
/g120Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
/g120Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
/g120Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
/g120An important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240300]

Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02-006
Clinical Protocol Version 1.0 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 42prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, such events 
include allergic bronchospasm, blood dysc rasias or convulsions, or the development 
of drug dependency or abuse) 
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
Causal relationship assessment to drug treatments is required for purposes of reporting AEs.  To 
promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration along with good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the relationship of drug treatments to an 
AE: 
Definitely Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medicat ion administration, and which 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible. 
Possibly Related: A clinical event, including  laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely Related: A clinical event, including labora tory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication admi nistration, and which other drugs, 
chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not Related: A clinical event, including  laboratory test abnormality, that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative etiology. 
9.4. Recording Adverse Events 
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last visit.  The patient should also be asked if he /she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant me dication routines (both prescription and OTC). 
In addition to patient observations, AEs will  be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other findings. 
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below. 
Mild: Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity. 
Moderate: Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
daily activity. 
Severe: Severe events are those which incapa citate and prevent usual activity. 
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of 
an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
189
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02-006
Clinical Protocol Version 1.0 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 43should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
9.5. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported after the first 
dose of patisiran regardless of their relationship to patisiran admi nistration through the end of the 
study. 
Any medical condition that is present when the patient enters this extension study and does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it does deteriorate at any time during 
the study, it should be reported as an AE. 
All AEs must be fully recorded in the site’s sou rce records and in the patients’ CRF, whether or 
not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE should be described in detail: onset time 
and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome (including time and date of  resolution, if applicable). 
Adverse events should be followed through the end of  study visit or until re covery to the normal 
state has been achieved, whichever occurs first.  In the eve nt of a patient not returning to the 
clinical unit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost to follow-up. 
For patients who withdraw from the study early, ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution 
or [ADDRESS_454572]. 
9.5.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the above seriousness criteria (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) must be 
reported immediately to the CRO, always within [ADDRESS_454573] the following information: 
/g120Patient’s study number
/g120Description and date of onset of the event 
/g120Criterion for serious 
/g120Preliminary assignment of causality 
Serious AE reporting will be via electronic data capture (EDC). 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the EDC system for the study.  If the 
event meets serious criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to 
Medpace Safety at  or call the Medpace SAE hotline 
listed below (country-specific phone number will be provided in the Stud y
 Manual), and fax the 
completed back-up paper SAE form to Medpace (country-specific

14.1. Case Report Forms 
The Investigator and designee s agree to maintain accurate CRFs and source documentation as 
part of these case histories.  Source documents are the originals of any documents used by [CONTACT_364539][INVESTIGATOR_307]/institution that allow verifica tion of the existence of the patient and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected during the trial. 
The Sponsor will supply CRFs for each patient.  Case report forms must be completed only by 
[CONTACT_192163].  Correctio ns must be made so as not to obliterate original 
data and must be identified and dated by [CONTACT_364574].  All data entered 
into the CRF must also be available in the source documents.  The Investigator will allow 
designated Sponsor represe ntatives and regulatory bodies to have direct access to the source 
documents to verify the data reported in the CRFs. 
Each completed CRF must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_192164] a timely 
manner.  The completed CRF will be the records ma intained by [CONTACT_1034].  A copy of the CRF 
will remain in the Investigator’s files.
14.2. Confidentiality 
The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ anonymity will be maintained.  On the CRFs or 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or design ees, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_111242], but by [CONTACT_192172].  If patient names are included on copi[INVESTIGATOR_364492], the names (except for initials) will be 
obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for 
submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintained by [CONTACT_144759]. 
Following the principles of the GCP, if local regulations specify a patient’s number and initials 
will be used to identify the patient on their study records.  Laboratory samples may be labeled 
with an independent numbering code , and the label will not contain any other personal 
identification information.  The numbering code associated with these labels will be held by [CONTACT_364543], thereby [CONTACT_192174].  The 
numbering code will also be he ld for samples in storage until marke ting approval of patisiran in 
the countries where this study was conducted, or u ntil clinical development of patisiran is halted.  
Throughout sample collection, storage (limited, staf f only access area containing locked sample 
storage, and limited access sample tra cking) and processing, the samples will only be handled by 
[CONTACT_192175] ’s standard operating procedures.
The Investigator must treat all of the information re lated to the study and the compi[INVESTIGATOR_144668], whose use is for the purpose of conducting the stud y.  The Sponsor must approve 
any transfer of information not directly involved in the study. 
199
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02-[ADDRESS_454584]. 
14.4. Retention of Records 
Essential documents should be retained for the period of  time required by [CONTACT_310548].  
The essential documents include the signed and dated final protocol, signed and dated 
amendments(s), if applicable, signed and dated curricula vitae of the Investigators, copi[INVESTIGATOR_364500], signed ICFs, IEC/IRB approval  and all related correspondence, financial 
agreements, regulatory approval, drug accountabi lity, study correspondence, and patient 
identification codes.  Records will not be destroyed without informing the Sponsor in writing and 
giving the Sponsor the opportunity to store the re cords for a longer period of time at the 
Sponsor ’s expense.
The ICH requires that patient identification codes be retained for at least 15 years after the completion or discontinuation of the study.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 58Appendix 3: Categorization of Infusion-Related Reactions 
Signs and symptoms of an infusion-related reacti on (IRR) usually develop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completel y within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
Signs/symptoms may include: allergic reaction/hype rsensitivity (including drug fever), arthralgia 
(joint pain), bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, dys pnea (shortness of breath), fatigue (asthenia, 
lethargy, malaise), headache, hypertension, hypotension, my algia (muscle pain), nausea, 
pruritus/itching, rash/desquamation, rigors/chills, sweating (diaphoresis), tach ycardia, urticaria 
(hives, welts, wheals), vomiting. 
Categorization of IRRs is as follows: 
Categorization Description
Mild Mild reaction:  infusion may be continued; if intervention is indicated 
it is minimal and additional treatment (other than paracetamol for delayed 
reactions) is not required.
Moderate Moderate reaction:  requires treatment including more intensive 
therapy (eg, IV fluids, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug 
[NSAIDs]) in addition to infusion interruption but responds promptly 
to medication.  Treatment is indicated for ≤24 hours.
Severe More than moderate reaction:  not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_364495]; and/ or prolonge d (treatment is indicated 
for >24 hours); recurrence of se vere symptoms following initial 
improvement.

Patisiran  
Title of Study: 
A Multicenter, Open -Label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long -term Safety and Efficacy of 
Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Who Have Completed a Prior Clinical 
Study with Patisiran  
Study Centers:  
This study will be conducted  at multiple sites worldwide that have enrolled patients in a previous 
patisiran study.  
Objectives : 
To assess the safety and efficacy of long -term dosing with patisiran in transthyretin -mediated 
amyloidosis  (ATTR ) patients with familial amyloidotic  polyneuropathy  (FAP). 
Methodology:   
This is a multicenter, multinational, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have previously completed a patisiran study.  
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran  intravenously ( IV) 
once every 21  (±3) days for the duration of the study.   In order to maintain the every [ADDRESS_454593] visit (Day 0) in this study [ADDRESS_454594] these 
efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites [CAS]”); these sites can also dose a nd 
manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites 
[PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS for their [ADDRESS_454595] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be continually 
assessed throughout the study for adverse events  (AEs) .  Unscheduled visits for study assessments may 
occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518].

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 18 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
Transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant, systemic 
disea
se caused by a mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene leading to the extracellular 
de
position of amyloid fibrils containing both mutant and wild type (WT) TTR.1,2 The particular 
TTR mutation and site of amyloid deposition determines the clinical manifestations of the 
disease, which include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or 
cardiomyopathy.  ATTR is a progressive disease associated with severe morbidity, with a life 
e
xpectancy limited to 5 to 15 years from symptom onset.3 There are over 100 reported TTR 
mutations which are associated with 2 clinical syndromes: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy 
(FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC).4,5,[ADDRESS_454622] common causative mutation of FAP is TTR Val30Met 
(V30M), with the onset of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_192106] 30 and 55 years of age.9 
Reduction of circulating amyloidogenic TTR improves outcomes in patients with FAP.  
Orthotopic liver transplantation, which eliminates mutant TTR from the circulation, has 
improved survival in early stage FAP patients.10  The TTR tetramer stabilizer tafamidis 
(Vyndaqel®) was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of stage 1 FAP based 
on e
vidence that it may slow neuropathy progression in these patients, but has not been approved 
for use in other regions of the world.  Diflunisal, a generic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(N
SAID) that is also a tetramer stabilizer, exhibits slowing of neuropathy progression in FAP 
pa
tients, but is not standardly used among practitioners.  Thus, there remains an unmet medical 
ne
ed for a potent and effective therapy for FAP that will have an impact on patients across a 
broad range of neurologic impairment, regardless of their mutation. 
1.2. Patisiran 
Patisiran (the International Nonproprietary Name [INN] name [CONTACT_364609]-TTR02) is a novel investigational agent being developed for the treatment of ATTR 
patients with symptomatic FAP.  Patisiran comprises a small interfering ribonucleic acid 
(siRNA)
 which is specific for TTR, and is formulated in a hepatotropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
for intravenous (IV) administration.11 It is designed to significantly suppress liver production of 
both WT and all mutant forms of TTR, thereby [CONTACT_364552]. 
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of patisiran were 
evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies that have enabled chronic dosing in clinical 
studies.  A summary of the nonclinical data can be found in the patisiran Investigators Brochure 
(IB). 
In a Phase 1 study of patisiran in healthy volunteers (Study ALN-TTR02-001), patisiran was 
g
enerally well tolerated.  Significant pharmacology in terms of TTR protein lowering (>80% 
reduction from pretreatment baseline) was observed at doses ≥0.15 mg/kg .  TTR levels showed 
evidence of recovery at Day 28 and return to baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 70.  A Phase 1 study in healthy 
226
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02)  ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 3.1-Argentina (Amendment 2) 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 19 subjects of Japanese origin (Study ALN-TTR02-005) also showed dose dependent reduction in 
serum TTR, similar to that observed in Study ALN-TTR02-001 in Caucasian subjects; patisiran 
was safe and well tolerated up to 0.3 mg/kg.  An open-label Phase 2 multiple ascending dose 
stud
y of patisiran in ATTR patients with FAP (Study ALN-TTR02-002) was conducted to 
determine the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a 60 or 70 minute IV 
infusion of patisiran administered once every 3 or 4 weeks for 2 doses.  The top dose of 
0.3 mg/kg administered every 3 or 4 weeks was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, 
with m
aximum TTR knockdown of ~90% and sustained TTR suppression of >80% most 
consistently observed with every 3 week dosing.  Twenty seven of the 29 patients treated on the 
Phase 2 trial enrolled in an open-label extension study (ALN-TTR02-003) to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of long-term dosing with patisiran for approximately [ADDRESS_454623] been generally safe and well-tolerated on the -003 study, with preliminary data 
indicating no changes in liver function tests, renal function, or hematologic parameters, and no 
treatment-related discontinuations.  Sustained suppression of serum TTR of >80% has been 
obser
ved in the open-label extension study, and preliminary clinical data at 6 months showed 
e
vidence for disease stabilization.12  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study of patisiran (ALN-TTR02-004; APOLLO) is ongoing worldwide.  The main objectives of 
the study are to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of patisiran and to establish the safety of 
chronic dosing in ATTR patients with FAP.  Further details on the clinical studies of patisiran 
can be found in the patisiran Investigator’s Brochure . 
1.3. Study Design Rationale 
This is a multicenter, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran. 
The nonclinical data and clinical experience with patisiran support the continuation of patisiran 
treatment in this long-term extension study for ATTR patients with FAP.  All patients will 
receive patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV every [ADDRESS_454624] completed a 
prior study with patisiran (provided they meet the eligibility criteria of this study), including 
those previously on placebo, to receive open-label patisiran.  Patients coming on to this open-
label study from a blinded study will remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment until 
at least database lock has occurred in that study.  The duration of the study has been determined 
to allow the collection of long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy data of patisiran in patients 
with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  The estimated duration of the study 
is [ADDRESS_454625] that lowering of the 
227
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02)  ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 3.1-Argentina (Amendment 2) 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential [ADDRESS_454626] the clinical course of the disease.  Based on 
nonclinical and clinical data that showed suppression in levels of WT and mutant TTR upon 
administration of 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every [ADDRESS_454627] a clinical benefit in FAP patients with mild to moderate polyneuropathy and that 
further study is warranted.  
In completed and ongoing clinical studies (ALN-TTR02-001, ALN-TTR02-[ADDRESS_454628]-
TTR02-003), single and multiple doses of patisiran have been generally well tolerated.  Potential 
risks of patisiran include the following:  
 I nfusion-Related Reactions  
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain biological 
agents such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the potential for an 
IRR with patisiran, all patients in this study will be premedicated prior to dosing with 
patisiran.  The step-wise infusion regimen over approximately 70 minutes (starting with a 
slower infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes before increasing 
to 3 m
L/minute for the remainder of the infusion), may further reduce the risk of an IRR. 
 L iver function test abnormalities   
In preclinical studies, patisiran-related increased serum liver markers and histopathology in 
the liver were observed at dosages > 0.1 mg/kg in rats and > 1.0 mg/kg in monkeys.  In 
gen
eral, all of the findings were not observed or were observed at lower severity at the end of 
the 60-[ADDRESS_454629] been  no clinically significant  change s in liver function tests  in 
either the single- dose or multiple -dose studies. Patients in the study are monitored for liver 
function via serial laboratory assessments.  
 Vitamin A Lowering  
The suppression of serum levels of TTR and retinol binding protein (RBP) is expected to 
re
sult in the lowering of circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical and clinical data have 
shown that the lowering of circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does 
not result in severe vitamin A deficiency.  Furthermore, there are individuals with RBP/TTR 
mutations who have life-long low levels of circulating vitamin A and are essentially in good 
health, suggesting that there are compensatory transport mechanisms for vitamin A that are 
yet undescribed.[ADDRESS_454630]

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential [ADDRESS_454633] previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran IV once 
every [ADDRESS_454634] a window of ± [ADDRESS_454635] visit (Day 0) on this study [ADDRESS_454636] 60 minutes before the start of the patisiran infusion .  Patisiran will be 
a
dministered as a 70-minute IV infusion (approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15-minutes 
followe
d by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion).  If the infusion 
duration for a patient was lengthened beyond 70 minutes due to the occurrence of an IRR while 
on the parent study, that infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular 
pa
tient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the 
Medic
al Monitor. 
After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site for patisiran dosing once every 
21 (±3) days  Patients will also have visits at the clinical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_454637] these efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites

for their 52-week efficacy assessments.  Every effort should be made for the patient to return to 
the same CAS center that the patient went t
o in the parent study.  Yearly efficacy assessments 
a
fter the 52-week visit may be done at a PCS.  Prior to starting the study, the CAS and PCS will 
create a delegation of responsibilities document that clearly details which site is responsible for 
which efficacy tests and safety parameters to ensure adherence to the protocol.  This document 
will
 become part of the study site specific documentation.

The Investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_344354] (IRS) (via phone 
or web) after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria.  The patient will then be assigned a patient number that corresponds to their 
current patient number on the pare
nt study.  A combination of the center number, parent study 
number
, enrollment number, and patient initials will create the unique patient identifier.  In 
countries with regulations prohibiting the use of patient initials, a strategy consistent with local 
regulations will be used to generate replacement values for the patient initials. 
3.4. Criteria for Study Termination 
The study may be terminated if patisiran does not obtain marketing approval or the development 
of patisiran is no longer being pursued by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
a
ny time.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all 
documentation and patisiran supplied for the study must be returned to the Sponsor or its 
re
presentative, and the Investigators, Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) / Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the 
reason for the decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure 
appropriate therapy and follow-up.

The
 Investigator may withdraw a patient from the study if the patient: 
 I s in violation of the protocol 
 Ex periences a serious or intolerable AE 
 B ecomes pregnant 
 R equires a prohibited medication (see Section 5.2) 
 R equests to be withdrawn from the study

Hig
hly effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year).  
Acceptable forms of effective contraception are defined as follows: 
 Hor monal:  established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal 
methods of conception 
 P lacement of an intrauterine device (IUD) 
 P lacement of an intrauterine system (IUS) 
 Mec hanical/barrier method of contraception:  condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault cap) in conjunction with spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or 
suppository) 
Note:  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not 
highly effective forms of contraception.  Therefore the use of additional spermicides 
doe
s confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  However, spermicides 
alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073].  
Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be 
used alone. 
 S urgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post-vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient); 
 S exual true abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Patients should be instructed to use [ADDRESS_454647] 
a
bove.  Examples of 2 forms of highly effective contraception are as follows:  
 Or al, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives in conjunction with 
condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
 I UD in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
 Surgical sterilization of partner in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and 
spermicide 
Interaction between patisiran and hormonal contraceptives is not anticipated.  The patisiran drug

of patisiran to interfere with the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives. 
Male

6.1. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling 
All packaging, labeling, and the preparation of patisiran will be in compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) specifications, as described in the Manufacture of Investigational 
Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_454649] is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 5.5 mL.  The 
c
ontainer closure system consists of a [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia 
(USP/EP) Type I borosilicate glass vial, a Teflon-faced butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium 
flip-off cap. 
6.2. Study Drug Storage 
Patisiran will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5 ± 3oC .  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions must be reported to the CRO and/or the Sponsor and use of 
the patisiran  halted until authorization for its continued use has been given by [CONTACT_364576].  
No special procedures for the
 safe handling of patisiran are required.  A Sponsor representative 
or
 designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, 
and records.  
Patisiran supplied for this study may not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study.

.3. Study Drug Preparation 
Staff at each clinical site or the healthcare professional administering patisiran will be 
re
sponsible for preparation of patisiran doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
All patients in this study will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days (± 3 days).  The 
amount (mg) of patisiran to be administered will be based on the patient’s body weight (kg) .  For 
e
ach dose administered, the weight obtained during the previous dosing visit will be used to 
calculate the dose of patisiran.  In the event that the weight obtained on the previous dosing day 
is not
 available, the weight obtained pre-dose on the current dosing day can be used for dose 
calculation.  Patients who weigh 105 kg or more will receive patisiran dosing based on an 
a
ssumption of a body weight of 104 kg. 
Patisiran will be prepared under aseptic condition s.  The total amount to be infused into each 
pa
tient at each dosing visit will be 200 mL.  Sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be added to a 
sterile infusion bag, and the calculated volume of patisiran will be withdrawn from the vials and 
inj
ected into the infusion bag.

Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2
blocker dose)
Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker
available at the clinical site).  Hydroxyzine 25 mg per os (PO, orally) or fexofenadine
30 mg or 60 mg PO or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient who
doe
s not tolerate IV diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker.
Further details (including a table of equivalent premedications) can be found in the patisiran 
Pharmacy Manual. 
Patients will be started on the above premedication regimen.  However, modifications may be 
made
 to the premedication regimen after consultation with the medical monitor either due to a 
pa
tient’s inability to tolerate one or more of the premedications or to the occurrence of IRRs 
unresponsive to slowing of the infusion rate. 
If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the steroid premedication regimen (e.g., patient
de
velops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status, or other complication), then
lowe
ring of the steroid premedication may be allowed for that patient after consultation with
the medical monitor.
If after consultation with the medical moni tor, it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid
premedication will be lowered, then the following steps must be followed :
1) If the current steroid dosage is 10 mg or less of intravenous dexamethasone or
e
quivalent, then the patient may be lowered in increments no greater than 2.5 mg
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent.
2) After each incremental lowering of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, the patient
must
 receive three consecutive intravenous doses of patisiran without IRR and continued
sig
ns or symptoms of steroid intolerance before further reductions in steroid
pr
emedications.
3) The premedication steroid dosage should not be reduced below 5 mg intravenous
dexamethasone or equivalent.
Alternatively if a patient experiences an IRR when 10 mg or less of IV dexamethasone 
or equivalent is used as the steroid premedication, then proceed to Section 6.4.3. 
If a patient’s premedication regimen  was modified prior to enrollment in Study TTR02-006, the 
patient may continue on that modified premedication regimen.

Patisiran will be administered under the supervision of the site personnel every 21 (±3) days.  
On all dosing days, patisiran will be administered as a 70-minute IV infusion (approximately 
1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder 
of
 the infusion). 
If the patient experiences an IRR the infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the
event of a mild or moderate IRR.
1) If the patient experiences a mild or moderate IRR that resolves by [CONTACT_364527].
2) If the patient experiences a severe IRR, then patisiran administration will not be resumed  
until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor (see Section 6.4.3).
If the infusion time for a patient was already extended on the parent study due to an IRR, that
modified infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular patient.
Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70  minutes will require a discussion with the
M
edical Monitor.
For the first 3 infusions of patisiran on this study, the patient’s infusion site should be
assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the
e
nd of the infusion, and the patient will remain at the clinical site for 1 hour following
completion of dosing.
If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will 
be
 considered missed and not administered. 
Additional details can be found in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual. 
I
n addition to study treatment, patients will receive the recommended daily allowance of 
vit
amin A in an or al supplement.  
6.4.3. S uggested Guidelines for Management of Infusion-Related Reactions 
Criteria for categorizing IRRs are provided in Appendix 3. 
I
n the event of an IRR, the infusion of patisiran may be stopped and the patient closely
monitored until resolution of the reaction.  Drugs that may be used to facilitate resolution and
permit resumption of patisiran administration include, but are not limited to:
paracetamol/acetaminophen (or equivalent), additional histamine H1/H2 receptor antagonists
(eg, ranitidine), NSAIDs, adrenaline, supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and/or corticosteroids.
F
ollowing resolution of a mild or moderate IRR that required interruption of the patisiran
infusion, resumption of administration may occur at the Investigator’s discretion at a slower
infusion rate (but not to exceed 3 hours) for that dose and for all subsequent doses of
patisiran.  If the infusion is delayed, the administration of the infusion should be completed
no more than 6 hours from the initial start of the infusion.
P
atisiran administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe IRR until the
case is discussed with the Medical Monitor.

premedication will be increased then the following steps are r ecommended : 
1) If the IRR occurred while the patient received [ADDRESS_454651] 60 minutes before the infusion and/or 5 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent the night before the intravenous infusion.  
2) Increased dose of premedication steroids should NOT exceed the combination of 20 mg 
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent on the day of infusion and 8 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent taken the night before the infusion.  
3) If the IRR occurred while the patient received less than 10 mg intravenous 
dexamethasone or equivalent, then the patient should return to the prior dose of 
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent that did not result in an IRR. 
Patients will be instructed to call the Investigator if they experience symptoms such as fever, 
chills, myalgia, or nausea/vomiting after discharge from the site. 
6.5. Study Drug Accountability

9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
9.2.1. De finition of Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS].
 Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Disease progression (including worsening of neuropathy impairment) will not be considered an 
AE. 
All IRRs will be recorded as AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event 
A serious AE (S AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
250
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02)  ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 3.1-Argentina (Amendment 2) 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 43  Results in death 
 I s life-threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred; it does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death) 
 R equires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 R esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 I s a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 An importa nt medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192109] (eg, such events 
include allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions, or the development 
of drug dependency or abuse) 
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
Causal relationship assessment to drug treatments is required for purposes of reporting AEs.  To 
promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration along with 
good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the relationship of drug treatments to an 
AE: 
Definitely Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible. 
Possibly Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information 
on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, 
chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology. 
9.4. Recording Adverse Events 
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC). 
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other findings. 
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below. 
251
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02)  ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 3.1-Argentina (Amendment 2) 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 44 Mild: Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity. 
Moderate: Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
daily activity. 
Severe: Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity. 
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of 
an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
9.5. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported after the first 
dose of patisiran regardless of their relationship to patisiran administration through the end of the 
study. 
Any medical condition that is present when the pa
tient enters this extension study and does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it does deteriorate at any time during 
the study, it should be reported as an AE. 
All AEs must be fully recorded in the site’s source records and in the patients’ CRF, whether or 
not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE should be described in detail: onset time 
and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
Adverse events should be followed through the end of study visit or until recovery to the normal 
state
 has been achieved, whichever occurs first.  In the event of a patient not returning to the 
clinical unit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost to follow-up. 
For patients who withdraw from the study early, ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution 
or [ADDRESS_454661].  SAEs will be followed by [CONTACT_364529]. 
9.5.1. S erious Adverse Event Reporting 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the above seriousness criteria (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) must be 
reported immediately to the CRO, always within [ADDRESS_454662] the following information: 
 P atient’s study number  
 De scription and date of onset of the event 
 Criterion for serious 
 Preliminary assignment of causality

9.5.2. P regnancy Reporting 
A female patient must have a negative pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_454666] dose of patisiran, the Investigator should report 
the pregnancy to the CRO within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the 
pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form.  Treatment with patisiran will be 
disconti
nued in any patient who is found to be pregnant during the study.  The patient should 
receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the 
possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723].  At the completion of the 
pr
egnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), then the Investigator should follow the 
procedures for reporting an SAE outlined above. 
Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a patient participating in the study should also be reported 
to the Investigator, who will then report this to the CRO and follow to outcome as described

At the time of recruitment, each prospective patient (or legal guardian) will be given a full 
explanation of the study and be allowed to read the ICF.  Once the Investigator is assured that the 
patient/legal guardian understands the commitments of participating in the study, the 
patient/legal guardian will be asked to sign and date the ICF.  A copy of the fully signed and 
dated ICF will be given to the patient.  The original ICF will be maintained in the patient’s 
medical record at the site.  All active patients will sign an updated ICF if revisions are made to 
the ICF during the course of the study. 
Prior to dosing in this study, the patient will sign and date the ICF and receive a copy of the 
signed ICF.  No study procedures should be performed before informed consent is obtained.  The 
Investigator or another person authorized by [CONTACT_364538] a copy to the patient.  The ICF will be filed in the patient’s medical record.

14.1. Case Report Forms 
The Investigator and designees agree to maintain accurate CRFs and source documentation as 
part of these case histories.  Source documents are the originals of any documents used by [CONTACT_364539][INVESTIGATOR_307]/institution that allow verification of the existence of the patient and 
subst
antiate the integrity of the data collected during the trial. 
The Sponsor will supply CRFs for each patient.  Case report forms must be completed only by 
[CONTACT_364540].  Corrections must be made so as not to obliterate original 
data and must be identified and dated by [CONTACT_364541].  All data entered 
into the CRF must also be available in the source documents.  The Investigator will allow 
designated Sponsor representatives and regulatory bodies to have direct access to the source 
doc
uments to verify the data reported in the CRFs. 
Each completed CRF must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_192164] a timely 
manner.  The completed CRF will be the records maintained by [CONTACT_1034].  A copy of the CRF 
will remain in the Investigator’s files.  
14.2. Confidentiality 
The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ anonymity will be maintained.  On the CRFs or 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_364542], but by [CONTACT_192172].  If patient names are included on copi[INVESTIGATOR_364492], the names (except for initials) will be 
obli
terated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for 
submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintained by [CONTACT_144759]. 
Following the principles of the GCP, if local regulations specify a patient’s number and initials 
will be used to identify the patient on their study records.  Laboratory samples may be labeled 
with an independent numbering code, and the label will not contain any other personal 
identification information.  The numbering code associated with these labels will be held by [CONTACT_364543], thereby [CONTACT_192174].  The 
numbering code will also be held for samples in storage until marketing approval of patisiran in 
the countries where this study was conducted, or until clinical development of patisiran is halted.  
Throughout sample collection, storage (limited, staff only access area containing locked sample 
storage, and limited access sample tracking) and processing, the samples will only be handled by 
[CONTACT_318454] p er the laboratory’s standard operating procedures.  
The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compi[INVESTIGATOR_144668], whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor must approve 
a
ny transfer of information not directly involved in the study.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 59 Appendix 3: Categorization of Infusion-Related Reactions 
Signs and symptoms of an infusion-related reaction (IRR) usually develop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
Signs/symptoms may include: allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever), arthralgia 
(joint pain), bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, dyspnea (shortness of breath), fatigue (asthenia, 
lethargy, malaise), headache, hypertension, hypotension, myalgia (muscle pain), nausea, 
pruritus/itching, rash/desquamation, rigors/chills, sweating (diaphoresis), tachycardia, urticaria 
(hives, welts, wheals), vomiting. 
Categorization of IRRs is as follows: 
Categorization  Description  
Mild  Mild reaction:  infusion may be continued; if intervention is indicated 
it is minimal and additional treatment (other than paracetamol  for 
delayed reactions) is not required.  
Moderate  Moderate reaction:  requires treatment including more intensive 
therapy (eg, IV fluids, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug 
[NSAIDs]) in addition to infusion interruption but responds promptly 
to medicatio n.  Treatment is indicated for ≤24 hours.  
Severe  More than moderate reaction:  not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_364495]; and/ or prolonged (treatment is indicated 
for >24 hours); recurrence of severe symptoms following initial

Rationale for Protocol Amendmen
t 
The primary purpose of this amendment is to add the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-
SSRS) to the study assessments, which was inadvertently left out of previous versions of the 
protocol. The inclusion of the C-SSRS addresses a regulatory requirement to prospectively 
assess suicidality in clinical trials involving all drugs for neurological indications.  Overall, this 
amendment includes the following changes: 
The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale has been added as an assessment of suicidal
idea
tion and behavior.
Electroretinograms are now recommended to be performed in the case of suspected
retinal disease.
The premedication regime
n has been updated to align with commercially available doses.
Reference to home infusions and to magnetic resonance neurography have been removed
as they will not be performed in Argentina.
The
 protocol was updated to include changes specified in the clarification letter dated

Title of Study:  
A Multicenter, Open -Label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long -term Safety and Efficacy of 
Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Who Have Completed a Prior Clinical 
Study with Patisiran  
Study Centers:  
This study will be conducted  at multiple sites worldwide that have enrolled patients in a previous 
patisiran study.  
Objectives : 
To assess the safety and efficacy of long -term dosing with patisiran in transthyretin -mediated 
amyloidosis  (ATTR ) patients with familial amyloidotic polyne uropathy  (FAP). 
Methodology:   
This is a multicenter, multinational, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have previously completed a patisiran study.  
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran  intravenously ( IV) 
once every 21  (±3) days for the duration of the study.   In order to maintain the every [ADDRESS_454695] visi t (Day 0) in this study [ADDRESS_454696] these

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 18 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
Transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant, systemic 
disea
se caused by a mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene leading to the extracellular 
de
position of amyloid fibrils containing both mutant and wild type (WT) TTR.1,2 The particular 
TTR mutation and site of amyloid deposition determines the clinical manifestations of the 
disease, which include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or 
cardiomyopathy.  ATTR is a progressive disease associated with severe morbidity, with a life 
expectancy limited to 5 to 15 years from symptom onset.3 There are over 100 reported TTR 
mutations which are associated with 2 clinical syndromes: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy 
(FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC).4,5,[ADDRESS_454724] common causative mutation of FAP is TTR Val30Met 
(V30M), with the onset of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_192106] 30 and 55 years of age.9 
Reduction of circulating amyloidogenic TTR improves outcomes in patients with FAP.  
Or
thotopic liver transplantation, which eliminates mutant TTR from the circulation, has 
improved survival in early stage FAP patients.10  The TTR tetramer stabilizer tafamidis 
(Vyndaqel®) was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of stage 1 FAP based 
on e
vidence that it may slow neuropathy progression in these patients, but has not been approved 
for use in other regions of the world.  Diflunisal, a generic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(N
SAID) that is also a tetramer stabilizer, exhibits slowing of neuropathy progression in FAP 
patients, but is not standardly used among practitioners.  Thus, there remains an unmet medical 
ne
ed for a potent and effective therapy for FAP that will have an impact on patients across a 
broad range of neurologic impairment, regardless of their mutation. 
1.2. Patisiran 
Patisiran (the International Nonproprietary Name [INN] name [CONTACT_364609]-
TTR02) is a novel investigational agent being developed for the treatment of ATTR 
patients with symptomatic FAP.  Patisiran comprises a small interfering ribonucleic acid 
(siRNA)
 which is specific for TTR, and is formulated in a hepatotropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
for intravenous (IV) administration.11 It is designed to significantly suppress liver production of 
both WT and all mutant forms of TTR, thereby [CONTACT_364552]. 
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of patisiran were 
evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies that have enabled chronic dosing in clinical 
studies.  A summary of the nonclinical data can be found in the patisiran Investigators Brochure 
(IB). 
In a Phase 1 study of patisiran in healthy volunteers (Study ALN-TTR02-001), patisiran was 
g
enerally well tolerated.  Significant pharmacology in terms of TTR protein lowering (>80% 
reduction from pretreatment baseline) was observed at doses ≥0.15 mg/kg .  TTR levels showed 
evidence of recovery at Day 28 and return to baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 70.  A Phase 1 study in healthy 
293
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02)  ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 3.12-Brazil (Amendment 2) 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 19 subjects of Japanese origin (Study ALN-TTR02-005) also showed dose dependent reduction in 
serum TTR, similar to that observed in Study ALN-TTR02-001 in Caucasian subjects; patisiran 
was safe and well tolerated up to 0.3 mg/kg.  An open-label Phase 2 multiple ascending dose 
stud
y of patisiran in ATTR patients with FAP (Study ALN-TTR02-002) was conducted to 
determine the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a 60 or 70 minute IV 
infusion of patisiran administered once every 3 or 4 weeks for 2 doses.  The top dose of 
0.3 mg/kg administered every 3 or 4 weeks was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, 
with m
aximum TTR knockdown of ~90% and sustained TTR suppression of >80% most 
consistently observed with every 3 week dosing.  Twenty seven of the 29 patients treated on the 
P
hase 2 trial enrolled in an open-label extension study (ALN-TTR02-003) to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of long-term dosing with patisiran for approximately [ADDRESS_454725] been generally safe and well-tolerated on the -003 study, with preliminary data 
indicating no changes in liver function tests, renal function, or hematologic parameters, and no 
treatment-related discontinuations.  Sustained suppression of serum TTR of >80% has been 
obser
ved in the open-label extension study, and preliminary clinical data at 6 months showed 
e
vidence for disease stabilization.12  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study of patisiran (ALN-TTR02-004; APOLLO) is ongoing worldwide.  The main objectives of 
the study are to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of patisiran and to establish the safety of 
chronic dosing in ATTR patients with FAP.  Further details on the clinical studies of patisiran 
can be found in the patisiran I nvestigator’s Brochure. 
1.3. Study Design Rationale 
This is a multicenter, open
-label extension study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran. 
The
 nonclinical data and clinical experience with patisiran support the continuation of patisiran 
treatment in this long-term extension study for ATTR patients with FAP.  All patients will 
receive patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV every [ADDRESS_454726] completed a 
prior study with patisiran (provided they meet the eligibility criteria of this study), including 
those previously on placebo, to receive open-label patisiran.  Patients coming on to this open-
label study from a blinded study will remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment until 
at least database lock has occurred in that study.  The duration of the study has been determined 
to allow the collection of long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy data of patisiran in patients 
with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  The estimated duration of the study 
is [ADDRESS_454727] that lowering of the

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential [ADDRESS_454728] the clinical course of the disease.  Based on 
nonclinical and clinical data that showed suppression in levels of WT and mutant TTR upon 
administration of 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every [ADDRESS_454729] a clinical benefit in FAP patients with mild to moderate polyneuropathy and that 
further study is warranted.  
In completed and ongoing clinical studies (ALN-TTR02-001, ALN-TTR02-[ADDRESS_454730]-
TTR02-003), single and multiple doses of patisiran have been generally well tolerated.  Potential 
risks of patisiran include the following:  
 I nfusion-Related Reactions 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain biological 
agents such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the potential for an 
IRR with patisiran, all patients in this study will be premedicated prior to dosing with 
patisiran.  The step-wise infusion regimen over approximately 70 minutes (starting with a 
slower infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes before increasing 
to 3 m
L/minute for the remainder of the infusion), may further reduce the risk of an IRR. 
 L iver function test abnormalities   
In preclinical studies, patisiran-related increased serum liver markers and histopathology in 
the liver were observed at dosages > 0.1 mg/kg in rats and > 1.0 mg/kg in monkeys.  In 
g
eneral, all of the findings were not observed or were observed at lower severity at the end of 
the 60-[ADDRESS_454731] been  no c linically significant  change s in liver function tests  in 
e
ither the single- dose or multiple -dose studies. Patients in the study are monitored for liver 
function via serial laboratory assessments.  
 Vitamin A Lowering 
The suppression of serum levels of TTR and retinol binding protein (RBP) is expected to 
re
sult in the lowering of circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical and clinical data have 
shown that the lowering of circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does 
not result in severe vitamin A deficiency.  Furthermore, there are individuals with RBP/TTR 
mutations who have life-long low levels of circulating vitamin A and are essentially in good 
health, suggesting that there are compensatory transport mechanisms for vitamin A that are 
yet undescribed.[ADDRESS_454732]

Clinical Protocol  Version 3.12-Brazil (Amendment 2) 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential [ADDRESS_454735] previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran IV once 
every [ADDRESS_454736] a window of ± [ADDRESS_454737] visit (Day 0) on this study [ADDRESS_454738] 60 minutes before the start of the patisiran infusion .  Patisiran will be 
a
dministered as a 70-minute IV infusion (approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15-minutes 
followe
d by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion).  If the infusion 
duration for a patient was lengthened beyond 70 minutes due to the occurrence of an IRR while 
on the parent study, that infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular 
pa
tient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the 
Medic
al Monitor. 
After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site for patisiran dosing once every 
21 (±3) days.  Patients will also have visits at the clinical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_454739] these efficacy assessments (referre d to as “Central Assessment Sites 
[CAS]”); these sites can dose and manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and 
mana
ge the patients (“Patient Care Sites [PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS 
for their 52-week efficacy assessments.  Every effort should be made for the patient to return to 
the same CAS center that the patient went t
o in the parent study.  Yearly efficacy assessments 
a
fter the 52-week visit may be done at a PCS.  Prior to starting the study, the CAS and PCS wi ll 
create a delegation of responsibilities document that clearly details which site is responsible for 
which efficacy tests and safety parameters to ensure adherence to the protocol.  This document 
will
 become part of the study site specific documentation.

continually assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs).  Unscheduled visits for study 
a
ssessments may occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518]. 
3.2. Number of Patients 
All patients who have previously completed a patisiran study may be enrolled if they meet the 
eligibility criteria for this study. 
3.3. Treatment Assignment 
All patients enrolled in this study will receive open-label patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV 
once every 21 (±3) days. 
The Investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_344354] (IRS) (via phone 
or web) after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria.  The patient will then be assigned a patient number that corresponds to their 
current patient number on the pare
nt study.  A combination of the center number, parent study 
number
, enrollment number, and patient initials wil
l create the unique patient identifier.  In 
countries with regulations prohibiting the use of patient initials, a strategy consistent with local 
regulations will be used to generate replacement values for the patient initials. 
3.4. Criteria for Study Termination 
The study may be terminated if patisiran does not obtain marketing approval or the development 
of patisiran is no longer being pursued by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
a
ny time.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all 
documentation and patisiran supplied for the study must be returned to the Sponsor or its 
re
presentative, and the Investigators, Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) / Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the 
reason for the decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure 
appropriate therapy and follow-up.

The
 Investigator may withdraw a patient from the study if the patient: 
Is in violation of the protocol
Experiences a serious or intolerable AE
Becomes pregnant
Requires a prohibited medication (see Section 5.2)
Requests to be withdrawn from the study
Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol-required patisiran dosing

The Investigator will withdraw patients from the study upon the request of the Sponsor, 
including
 if the Sponsor terminates the study.  Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, 
the 
Investigator will confer with the Sponsor before discontinuing the patient. 
Mi
ssing an occasional dose of patisiran will not necessarily result in the patient being withdrawn 
fr
om the study.  However, if a patient misses [ADDRESS_454746] and on the case report form (CRF). 
In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study, the clinical research organization (CRO)

or fetal development despi[INVESTIGATOR_364488] (-88% from baseline) in serum vitamin A in the dams 
dosed with the rat-specific TTR surrogate siRNA. 
In this study, women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, cannot be 
breastfeeding, and must be using [ADDRESS_454748] dose of patisiran in this study.  
Hig
hly effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year).  
Acceptable forms of effective contraception are defined as follows: 
 Hor monal:  established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal 
methods of c
onception 
 P lacement of an intrauterine device (IUD) 
 P lacement of an intrauterine system (IUS) 
 Mec hanical/barrier method of contraception:  condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault cap) in conjunction with spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or 
suppository) 
Note:  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not 
highly effective forms of contraception.  Therefore the use of additional spermicides 
doe
s confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  However, spermicides 
alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073].  
Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be 
used alone. 
 S urgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post-vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient); 
 S exual true abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Patients should be instructed to use [ADDRESS_454749] 
above.  Examples of 2 forms of highly effective contraception are as follows:  
 Oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives in conjunction with 
condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
 I UD in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
 Surgical sterilization of partner in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and 
spermicide 
Interaction between patisiran and hormonal contraceptives is not anticipated.  The patisiran drug 
subst
ance ALN-[ZIP_CODE] (siRNA), and the 2 novel lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 1,2-Dilinoleyloxy-N,N-

sn-glyceride  (PEG -2000-C-DMG ), were evaluated by [CONTACT_364578] P450 (CYP) activity.  None of the 
c
omponents displayed an inhibitory effect on any of the CYPs investigated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9,

CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at any of the concentrations studied.  These data suggest a low likelihood 
of
 patisiran to interfere with the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives. 
Male
s (including men who have had vasectomies) with partners of child-bearing potential, must 
agree to use 1 barrier method (eg, condom) and 1 additional method (eg, spermicidal foam, gel,

S
olution for Injection contains 2 mg/mL of the TTR siRNA drug substance. 
5.2. Concomitant Medications 
Use of the following medications/treatments is prohibited during study participation: 
 An y investigational agent other than patisiran 
 C orticosteroids other than those administered as premedications prior to the dose of 
patisiran, those used to treat an infusion reaction, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_124374].  
However, for patients with chronic inflammatory disorders (eg, asthma, rheumatoid 
arthritis), systemically administered steroids may be permitted provided that: 1) the 
dose is <20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent if administered chronically, or 2) for 
doses ≥2 0 mg/day, administration is limited to no more than 5 consecutive days. 
Use of the medications/treatments listed below is permitted in patients who were already taking 
such medications while on the parent study in accordance with the rules of that study protocol.  
F
or patients who did not take these medications while on the parent study, use of these 
medic
ations is permitted, if necessary, only after the patient has completed the 52-week visit. 
 Ta famidis 
 Diflunisal  
 Dox ycycline/TUDCA 
Medications and treatments other than those specified above, including palliative and supportive 
care approved by [CONTACT_364525]-related symptoms, are permitted during the study. 
All patients will be asked to continue to take an oral daily supplement containing the 
recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. 
Any concomitant medication or treatment that is required for the patient’s welfare may be given 
by [CONTACT_737].  Use of all concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded on the 
patient’s CRF through the end of the patient’s participation in the study.  This will include all 
prescription drugs, herbal preparations, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and 
minerals.  Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the CRF.

6.1. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling 
All packaging, labeling, and the preparation of patisiran will be in compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) specifications, as described in the Manufacture of Investigational 
Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_454751] is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 5.5 mL.  The 
c
ontainer closure system consists of a [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia 
(USP/EP) Type I borosilicate glass vial, a Teflon-faced butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium 
flip-off cap. 
6.2. Study Drug Storage 
Patisiran will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5 ± 3oC .  Any deviati on from 
the recommended storage conditions must be reported to the CRO and/or the Sponsor and use of 
the patisiran  halted until authorization for its continued use has been given by [CONTACT_364576].  
No special procedures for the
 safe handling of patisiran are required.  A Sponsor representative 
or
 designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, 
and records.  
Patisiran supplied for this study may not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. 
6
.3. Study Drug Preparation 
Staff at each clinical site or the healthcare professional administering patisiran will be 
re
sponsible for preparation of patisiran doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
All patients in this study will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days (± 3 days).  The 
amount (mg) of patisiran to be administered will be based on the patient’s body weight (kg) .  For 
e
ach dose administered, the weight obtained during the previous dosing visit will be used to 
calculate the dose of patisiran.  In the event that the weight obtained on the previous dosing day 
is not
 available, the weight obtained pre-dose on the current dosing day can be used for dose 
calculation.  Patients who weigh 105 kg or more will receive patisiran dosing based on an 
a
ssumption of a body weight of 104 kg. 
Patisiran will be prepared under aseptic conditions.  The total amount to be infused into each 
pa
tient at each dosing visit will be 200 mL.  Sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be added to a 
sterile infusion bag, and the calculated volume of patisiran will be withdrawn from the vials and 
inj
ected into the infusion bag.

Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2
blocker dose)
Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker
available at the clinical site).  Hydroxyzine 25 mg per os (PO, orally) or fexofenadine
30 mg or 60 mg PO or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient who
does not tolerate IV diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker.
Further details (including a table of equivalent premedications) can be found in the patisiran 
Pharmacy Manual. 
Patients will be started on the above premedication regimen.  However, modifications may be 
made
 to the premedication regimen after consultation with the medical monitor either due to a 
pa
tient’s inability to tolerate one or more of the premedications or to the occurrence of IRRs 
unresponsive to slowing of the infusion rate. 
If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the steroid premedication regimen (e.g., patient
de
velops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status, or other complication), then
lowe
ring of the steroid premedication may be allowed for that patient after consultation with
the medical monitor.
If after consultation with the medical monitor, it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid
pr
emedication will be lowered, then the following steps m ust be followed :
1) If the current steroid dosage is 10 mg or less of intravenous dexamethasone or
e
quivalent, then the patient may be lowered in increments no greater than 2.5 mg
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent.
2) After each incremental lowering of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, the patient
must
 receive three consecutive intravenous doses of patisiran without IRR and continued
sig
ns or symptoms of steroid intolerance before further reductions in steroid
premedications.
3) The premedication steroid dosage should not be reduced below 5 mg intravenous
dexamethasone or equivalent.
Alternatively if a patient experiences an IRR when 10 mg or less of IV dexamethasone 
or equivalent is used as the steroid premedication, then proceed to Section 6.4.3. 
If a patient’s premedication regimen was modified prior to enrollment in Study TTR02-006, the 
patient may continue on that modified premedication regimen.

Patisiran will be administered under the supervision of the site personnel every 21 (±3) days.  
On all dosing days, patisiran will be administered as a 70-minute IV infusion (approximately 
1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder 
of
 the infusion). 
If the patient experiences an IRR the infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the
event of a mild or moderate IRR.
1) If the patient experiences a mild or moderate IRR that resolves by [CONTACT_364527].
2) If the patient experiences a severe IRR, then patisiran administration will not be resumed  
until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor (see Section 6.4.3).
If the infusion time for a patient was already extended on the parent study due to an IRR, that
modified infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular patient.
Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70  minutes will require a discussion with the
M
edical Monitor.
For the first 3 infusions of patisiran on this study, the patient’s infusion site should be
assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the
end of the infusion, and the patient will remain at the clinical site for 1 hour following
completion of dosing.
If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will 
be considered missed and not administered. 
Additional details can be found in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual. 
I
n addition to study treatment, patients will receive the recommended daily allowance of 
vit
amin A in an oral supplement.

9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
9.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicina l 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Disease progression (including worsening of neuropathy impairment) will not be considered an 
AE. 
All IRRs will be recorded as AEs.

Patisiran (ALN-TTR02)  ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 3.12-Brazil (Amendment 2) 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 44 [IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event 
A serious AE (S AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 R esults in death 
 I s life-threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred; it does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death) 
 R equires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 R esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 I s a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 An importa nt medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192109] (eg, such events 
include allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions, or the development 
of drug dependency or abuse) 
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
Causal relationship assessment to drug treatments is required for purposes of reporting AEs.  To 
promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration along with 
good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the relationship of drug treatments to an 
AE: 
Definitely Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible. 
Possibly Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information 
on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, 
chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology. 
9.4. Recording Adverse Events 
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC). 
319
Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) ALN-TTR02- 006 
Clinical Protocol Version 3.12-Brazil (Amendment 2) 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 45 In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other findings. 
Adve
rse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below. 
Mild: Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity. 
Moderate: Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
daily activity. 
Severe: Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity. 
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of 
an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
9.5. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported after the first 
dose of patisiran regardless of their relationship to patisiran administration through the end of the 
study. 
Any medical condition that is present when the patient e
nters this extension study and does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it does deteriorate at any time during 
the study, it should be reported as an AE. 
All AEs must be fully recorded in the site’s source records and in the patients’ CRF, whether or 
not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE should be described in detail: onset time 
and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
Adverse events should be followed through the end of study visit or until recovery to the normal 
state
 has been achieved, whichever occurs first.  In the event of a patient not returning to the 
clinical unit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost to follow-up. 
For patients who withdraw from the study early, ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution 
or [ADDRESS_454766].  SAEs will be followed by [CONTACT_364529]. 
9.5.1. Ser ious Adverse Event Reporting 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the above seriousness criteria (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) must be 
reported immediately to the CRO, always within [ADDRESS_454767] the following information:

9.5.2. P regnancy Reporting 
A female patient must have a negative pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_454772] dose of patisiran, the Investigator should report 
the pregnancy to the CRO within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the 
pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form.  Treatment with patisiran will be 
disconti
nued in any patient who is found to be pregnant during the study.  The patient should 
receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the 
possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723].  At the completion of the 
pr
egnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), then the Investigator should follow the 
procedures for reporting an SAE outlined above. 
Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a patient participating in the study should also be reported 
to the Investigator, who will then report this to the CRO and follow to outcome as described

will remain in the Investigator’s files.  
14.2. Confidentiality 
The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ anonymity will be maintained.  On the CRFs or 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_364542], but by [CONTACT_192172].  If patient names are included on copi[INVESTIGATOR_364492], the names (except for initials) will be 
obli
terated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for 
submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintained by [CONTACT_144759]. 
Following the principles of the GCP, if local regulations specify a patient’s number and initials 
will be used to identify the patient on their study records.  Laboratory samples may be labeled 
with an independent numbering code, and the label will not contain any other personal 
identification information.  The numbering code associated with these labels will be held by [CONTACT_364543], thereby [CONTACT_192174].  The 
numbering code will also be held for samples in storage until marketing approval of patisiran in 
the countries where this study was conducted, or until clinical development of patisiran is halted.  
Throughout sample collection, storage (limited, staff only access area containing locked sample 
storage, and limited access sample tracking) and processing, the samples will only be handled by 
[CONTACT_192175]’s standard operat ing procedures. 
The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compi[INVESTIGATOR_144668], whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor must approve

S
igns and symptoms of an infusion-related reaction (IRR) usually develop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
Signs/symptoms may include: allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever), arthralgia 
(joint pain), bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, dyspnea (shortness of breath), fatigue (asthenia, 
lethargy, malaise), headache, hypertension, hypotension, myalgia (muscle pain), nausea, 
pr
uritus/itching, rash/desquamation, rigors/chills, sweating (diaphoresis), tachycardia, urticaria 
(hives, welts, wheals), vomiting. 
Categorization of IRRs is as follows: 
 
Categorization  Description  
Mild  Mild reaction:  infusion may be continued; if intervention is indicated 
it is minimal and additional treatment (other than paracetamol for 
delayed reactions) is not required.  
Moderate  Moderate reaction:  requires treatment  including more intensive 
therapy (eg, IV fluids, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug 
[NSAIDs]) in addition to infusion interruption but responds promptly 
to medication.  Treatment is indicated for ≤24 hours.  
Severe  More than moderate reaction:  not rapid ly responsive to medication or 
to interruption of infusion; and/ or prolonged (treatment is indicated 
for >24 hours); recurrence of severe symptoms following initial 
improvement.

A M
ulticenter, Open-label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety and 
Efficacy of Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy who have 
Completed a Prior Clinical Study with Patisiran 
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment 
The primary purpose of this amendment is to add the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-
SSRS) to the study assessments, which was inadvertently left out of previous versions of the 
protocol. The inclusion of the C-SSRS addresses a regulatory requirement to prospectively 
assess suicidality in clinical trials involving all drugs for neurological indications.  Overall, this 
amendment includes the following changes: 
 The  Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale has been added as an assessment of suicidal 
idea
tion and behavior. 
 Ele ctroretinograms are now recommended to be performed in the case of suspected 
retinal disease. 
 The premedication regimen has been updated to align with commercially available doses. 
 B lood samples for long-term storage have been added in order to permit future 
exploratory investigations. 
 R eference to home infusions and to magnetic resonance neurography have been removed 
as they will not be performed in Brazil. 
A detailed summary of the above changes, in addition to changes made for clarity, is provided in 
Table 1.  Corrections to abbreviations, typographical errors and formatting are not detailed.

 Amendment 3.1 Brazil Summary of Changes_ 20 January 2017 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 2 Table 1: Protocol Version 3.1 Brazil Detailed Summary of Changes 
The primary section(s) of the protocol affected by [CONTACT_364545].  The corresponding text has 
been revised throughout the protocol.  Deleted text is indicated by [CONTACT_364546]; added text is indicated by [CONTACT_364547]. 
Purpose: Added Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale to the study assessments  
The primary change occurs in Table 1 Schedule of Assessments  
Added text:  Added row to Schedule of Assessments indicating that the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale is to be 
collected at 26 weeks and 52 weeks after baseline and annually thereafter, as well as at the End of Study and Early 
Withdrawal visits.  
Section(s) also containing this change or similar changes:  
 Synopsis, Criteria for Evaluation, Safety  
 Section 9.1.7 Co lumbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (section added)  
Purpose: To remove reference to home infusions as this will not be performed in Brazil.  
The primary change occurs in Section 3.1 Overall Study Design  
Deleted text:  After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site for patisiran dosing once every 21  (±3) 
days, or receive the patisiran infusions at home by a healthcare professional trained on the protocol and 
delivery of premedications and patisiran.  Patients who are receiving patis iran infusions at home will have 
a phone contact [CONTACT_364522] 30 (±5) days .  Patients will also have visits at the clinical site at 
approximately 12, 26 and 52 weeks, and yearly thereafter.  
Section(s) also containing this change or similar  changes:  
 Synopsis methodology  
 Table [ADDRESS_454789] row (removed)  
 Table 1 Schedule of Assess ments, Footnote y and Footnote z  
 Section 5.3 Treatment Compliance  
 Section 6.4.2 Study Drug Administration  
Purpose: To update premedication regimen so that it aligns with commercially available doses.  
The primary change occurs in Section 6.4.1 Premedication

Title of Study:  
A Multicenter, Open -Label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long- term Safety and Efficacy of 
Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Who Have Completed a Prior 
Clinical Study with Patisiran  
Study Centers:  
This study will be conducted at multiple sites worldwide that have enrolled patients in a previous 
patisiran study.  
Objectives : 
To assess the safety and efficacy of long -term dosing with patisiran in transthyretin -mediated 
amyloidosis ( ATTR ) patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy ( FAP). 
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, multinational, open-label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran  intravenously ( IV) 
once every 21  (±3) days f or the duration of the study.  In order to maintain the every 21-day dosing 
schedule from the parent study , patients are expected to have their first visit (Day 0) in this study [ADDRESS_454799] every 30 (±5) days .  Patients will also have visits at the 
clinical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_454800] these 
efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites [CAS]”); these sites can also dose and 
manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites 
[PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS for their [ADDRESS_454801] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be 
continually assessed t hroughout the study for adverse events (AEs) .  Unscheduled visits for study 
assessments may occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518].

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  18 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
Transthyretin -mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant, systemic 
disease caused by a mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene leading to the extracellular 
deposition of amyloid fibrils containing both mutant and wild type (WT) TTR.1,2 The particular 
TTR mutation and site of amyloid deposition determines the clinical manifestations of the disease, which include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy.  AT TR is a progressive disease associated with severe morbidity, with a life 
expectancy limited to 5 to 15  years from symptom onset.
3 There are over 100 reported TTR 
mutations which are associated with 2 clinical syndromes: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy  
(FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC).4,5,[ADDRESS_454829] common causative mutation of FAP is TTR Val30Met 
(V30M), with the onset of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_192106] 30 and 55 years of age.9 
Reduction of circulating amyloidogenic TTR improves outcomes in patients with FAP.  Orthotopic liver transplantation, which eliminates mutant TTR fr om the circulation, has 
improved survival in early stage FAP patients .
10  The TTR tetramer stabilizer tafamidis 
(Vyndaqel®) was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of stage 1 FAP based 
on evidence that it may slow neuropathy progression in these patients, but has not been approved for use in other regions of the world.  Diflunisal, a generic, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that is also a tetramer stabilizer , exhibits slowing of neuropathy progression in FAP 
patients, but is not standardly used among practitioners.  Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for a potent and effective therapy for FAP that will have an impact on patients across a 
broad range of neurologic impairment, regardless of their mutation. 
1.2. Patisiran  
Patisira n (the International Nonproprietary Name [INN] name [CONTACT_364609] -TTR02) is a novel investigational agent being developed for the treatment of ATTR 
patients with symptomatic FAP .  Patisiran comprises a small interfering ribon ucleic acid 
(siRNA) which is specific for TTR, and is formulated in a hepatotropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
for intravenous (IV) administration.11 It is designed to significantly suppress liver production of 
both WT and all mutant forms of TTR, thereby [CONTACT_364552].  
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of patisiran were 
evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies that have enabled ch ronic dosing in clinical 
studies.  A summary of the nonclinical data can be found in the patisiran Investigators Brochure (IB).  
In a Phase 1 study of patisiran in healthy volunteers (Study ALN- TTR02 -001), patisiran was 
generally well tolerated .  Significan t pharmacology in terms of TTR protein lowering (>80% 
reduction from pretreatment baseline) was observed at doses ≥0.15 mg/kg .  TTR levels showed 
evidence of recovery at Day 28 and return to baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 70.  A Phase 1 study in healthy 
subjects of Japanese origin (Study ALN- TTR02 -005) also showed dose dependent reduction in 
361
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  [ADDRESS_454830]- TTR02 -001 in Caucasian subjects; patisiran 
was safe and well tolerated up to 0.3 mg/kg.  A n open- label Phase 2 multiple ascending dose 
study of patisiran in ATTR patients with FAP (Study ALN -TTR02 -002) was conducted to 
determine the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a 60 or 70 minute IV 
infusion of patisiran administered once every 3 or 4 weeks for 2 doses.  The top dose of 
0.3 mg/kg administered every 3 or 4 weeks was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, 
with maximum TTR knockdown of ~90% and sustained TTR suppression of >80% most consistently observed with every 3 week dosing.  Twenty seven of the 29 patients treated on the 
Phase 2 trial enrolled in an open-label extension study (ALN- TTR02 -003) to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of long -term dosing with patisiran for approximately [ADDRESS_454831] been generally safe and well -tolerated on the -003 study, with preliminary data 
indicating no changes in liver function tests, renal function, or hematologic parameters, and no 
treatment -related discontinuations.  Sustained suppression of serum TTR of >80% has been 
observed in the open- label extension study, and preliminary clinical data at 6 months showed 
evidence for disease stabilization.
12  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study of patisiran (ALN- TTR02 -004; APOLLO) is ongoing worldwide.  The main objectives of 
the study are to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of patisiran and to establish the safety of 
chronic dosing in ATTR patients with FAP.  Further details on the clinical studies of patisiran 
can be found in the pa tisiran IB.  
1.3. Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study designed  to evaluate the long -term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  
The nonclinical data and clinical  experience with patisiran support the continuation of patisiran 
treatment in this long -term extension study for ATTR patients with FAP.  All patients will 
receive patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV every [ADDRESS_454832] completed a prior study with patisiran (provided they meet the eligibility criteria of this study), including 
those previously on placebo, t o receive open -label patisiran.  Patients coming on to this open -
label study from a blinded study will remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment until 
at least database lock has occurred in that study.  The duration of the study has been determined 
to allow the collection of long- term safety, tolerability and efficacy  data of patisiran in patients 
with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  The estimated duration of the study 
is [ADDRESS_454833] the clinical course of the disease.   Based on 
362
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol   Version 2.1 -Brazil (Amendment 1)  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  20 nonclinical and clinical data that showed suppression in levels of WT and mutant TTR upon 
administration of 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every [ADDRESS_454834] a clinical benefit in FAP patients with mild to moderate polyneuropathy and that 
further study is warranted.  
In completed and ongoing clinical studies (ALN- TTR02 -001, ALN- TTR02 -[ADDRESS_454835]-
TTR02 -003), single and multiple doses of patisiran have been generally well tolerated.  Potential 
risks of patisiran include the following:  
• Infusion- Related Reactions  
Infusion- related reactions (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain biological 
agents such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the potential for an 
IRR with patisiran, all patients in this study will be premedicated p rior to dosing with 
patisiran .  The step -wise infusion regimen over approximately 70 minutes (starting with a 
slower infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes before increasing to 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion), may further reduce the risk of an IRR. 
• Liver function test abnormalities   
In preclinical studies, patisiran -related increased serum liver markers and histopathology in 
the liver w ere observed at dosages > 0.1 mg/kg in rats and > 1.0 mg/kg in monkeys.  In 
general, all of the findings were not observed or were observed at lower severity at the end of 
the 60-[ADDRESS_454836] been  no clinically significant  changes in  liver function tests  in 
either the single -dose or multiple -dose studies. Patients in the study are monitored for liver 
function via serial laboratory assessments.  
• Vitamin A Lowering  
The suppression of serum levels of TTR and RBP is expected to result in the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical and clinical data have shown that the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does not result in severe vitamin A 
deficiency.  Furthermore, there are individuals with RBP/TTR mutations who have life- long 
low levels of circulating vitamin A and are essentially in good health, suggesting that there 
are compensatory transport mechanisms for vitamin A that are yet undescribed.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  [ADDRESS_454840] previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran IV once 
every [ADDRESS_454841] a window of ± [ADDRESS_454842] visit (D ay 0) o n this study [ADDRESS_454843] 60 minutes before the start of the patisiran infusion .  Patisiran will be 
administered as a 70 -minu te IV infusion (approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 -minutes 
followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion).  If the infusion 
duration for a patient was lengthened beyond 70 minutes due to the occurrence of an IRR while on the parent study, that infusion duration may  be continued on this study for that particular 
patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site for patisiran dosing once every 
21 (±3) days, or receive the patisiran infusions at home by a healthcare professional trained on 
the protocol and delivery of premedication s and patisiran .  Patients who are receiving patisiran 
infusions at home will have a phone contact [CONTACT_364522] 30 (±5) days.  Pat ients 
will also have visits at the clinical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_454844] these efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites 
[CAS]”); these sites can  dose and manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and 
manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites [PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS 
for their 52-week efficacy assessments .  Every effort should be made for the patient to return to 
the same CAS center that the patient went to in the parent study .  Yearly efficacy assessments 
after the 52 -week visit may be done at a PCS.  Prior to starting the study, the CAS and PCS will 
create a delegation of responsibilities document that clearly details which site is responsible for

continually assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs) .  Unscheduled visits for study 
assessments may o ccur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518].  
3.2. Number of Patients 
All patients who have previously completed a patisiran study may be enrolled if they meet the 
eligibility criteria for this study.  
3.3. Treatment Assignment  
All patients enrolled in this study will receive open -label patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV 
once every 21 (±3) days. 
The Investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_344354] (IRS) (via phone 
or web) after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria .  The patient will then  be assigned a patient number that corresponds to their 
current patient number on the parent study.  A combination of the center number, parent study number, enrollment number, and patient initials will create the unique patient identifier.  In 
countries with regulations prohibiting the use of patient initials, a strategy consistent with local regulations will be used to generate replacement values for the patient initials.  
3.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study may be terminated if patisiran does not obtain marketing approval or the development of patisiran is no longer being pursued by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
any time.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all 
documentation and patisiran supplied for the study must be returned to the Sponsor  or its 
representative, and the Investigators, Independent Ethics Committ ee (IEC) / Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure 
appropriate therapy and follow-up.

Highly effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year).  Acceptable forms of effective contraception are defined as follows:  
• Hormonal:  established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal 
methods of conception 
• Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Placement of an intrauterine system (IUS)  
• Mechanical/barrier method of contraception:  condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault cap) in conjunction with spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or 
suppository) 
Note:  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not 
highly effective forms of contraception.  Therefore the use of additional spermicides 
does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  However, spermicides 
alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073] .  
Therefore, spermicid es are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be 
used alone. 
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient); 
• Sexual true abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Patients should be instructed to use [ADDRESS_454854] above.  Examples of 2 forms of highly effective contraception are as follows:  
• Oral, implantable, injectable,  or transdermal contraceptives in conjunction with 
condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• IUD in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• Surgical sterilization of partner in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and 
spermicide

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  31 6. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
6.1. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and the preparation of patisiran will be in compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) specifications, as described in the Manu facture of Investigational 
Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_454857] is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 5.5 mL.  The container closure system consists of a [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia (USP/EP) Ty pe I borosilicate glass vial, a Teflon -faced butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium 
flip-off cap.  
6.2. Study Drug Storage  
Patisiran  will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5 ± 3oC.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions must be reported to the CRO and/or the Sponsor and use of the patisiran  halted until authorization for its continued use has been given by [CONTACT_95346].  
No special procedures for the safe handling of patisiran are required.  A Sponsor representative 
or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, 
and records.  
Patisiran  supplied for this study may not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. 
6.3. Study Drug Preparation  
Staff at each clinical  site or the healthcare professional administering patisiran  will be 
responsible for preparation of patisiran doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  
All patients in this study will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days (± 3 days).  The 
amount (mg) of patisiran to be administered will be  based on the patient’s body weight (kg).  For 
each dose administered, the weight obtained during the previous dosing visit will be used to calculate the dose of patisiran .  In the event that  the weight obtained on the previous dosing day 
is not available, the weight obtained pre-dose on the current dosing day can be used for dose calculation.  Patients who weigh 105 kg or more will receive patisiran dosing based on an 
assumption of a body weight of 104 kg. 
Patisiran will be prepared under aseptic conditions.  The total amount to be infused into each 
patient at each dosing visit will be 200 mL.  Sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be added to a sterile infusion bag, and the calculated volume of patisiran  will be withdrawn from the vials and 
injected into the infusion bag.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  [ADDRESS_454858] 60 minutes before the infusion: 
• Intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg) or equivalent 
• Oral paracetamol/acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent 
• Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2 
blocker dose) 
• Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker available at the clinical  site).  Hydroxyzine or fexofenadine 25 mg per os (PO, orally) 
or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient who does not tolerate IV diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker. 
Further details (including a table of equivalent premedications) can be found in the patisiran  
Pharmacy Manual.  
Patients will be started on the above premedication regimen.   However, modifications may be 
made to the premedication regimen after consultation with the medical monitor either due  to a 
patient’s inability to tolerate one or more of the premedications or to the occurrence of IRRs unresponsive to slowing of the infusion rate. 
• If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the steroid premedication regimen (e.g., patient 
develops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status , or other complication), then 
lowering of the steroid premedication may be allowed for that patient after consultation with 
the medical monitor.   
• If after consultation with the medical monitor, it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid premedication  will be lowered, then the following steps must be followed : 
1) If the current steroid dosage is 10 mg or less of  intravenous dexamethasone or 
equivalent, then the patient may be lowered in increments no greater than 2.5 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent. 
2) After each incremental lowering of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, the patient 
must receive three consecutive intravenous doses of patisiran without IRR and continued signs or symptoms of steroid intolerance before further reductions in steroid 
premedications.   
3) The premedication steroid dosage should not be reduced below 5 mg intravenous 
dexamethasone or equivalent. 
Alternatively if a patient experie nces an IRR when 10 mg or less of IV dexamethasone or 
equivalent is used as the steroid premedication, then proceed to Section 6.4.3. 
If a patient’s  premedication regimen was modified prior to enrollment in Study TTR02 -006, the 
patient may continue on that modified premedication regimen.

Patisiran will be administered under the supervision of the site personnel every 21 (±3) days.  
Patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_454859] patisiran administered at home , where 
applicable country and local regulations allow.  Home administration of patisiran will be done 
according to a site -specific plan  by a healthcare professional trained  on the protocol and delivery 
of premedications and patisiran. 
On all dosing days, patisiran will be administered as a 70 -minute IV infusion (approxima tely 
1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3  mL/minute for the remain der 
of the infusion). 
• If the patient experiences an IRR the infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the 
event of a mild or moderate IRR. 
1) If the patient experiences a mild or moderate IRR that resolves by [CONTACT_364579].  
2) If the patient experiences a severe IRR, then  patisiran administration will not be resumed 
until the case is discussed with  the Medical Monitor (see Section  6.4.3).   
• If the infusion time for a patient was already extended on the parent study due to an IRR, that 
modified infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discus sion with the 
Medical Monitor. 
• For the first 3 infusions of patisiran on this study, the patient’s infusion site should be assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the 
end of the infusion, and the patient will remain at the clinical site for 1 hour following 
completion of dosing. 
If a patient does not receive a dose of  patisiran  within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will 
be considered missed and not administered. 
Additional details  can be found in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual.  
In addition to study treatment, patients will receive  the recomme nded daily allowance of 
vitamin  A in an oral supplement. 
6.4.3. Suggested Guideli nes for Management of Infusion-R elated Reactions  
Criteria for categorizing IRRs are provided in Appendix 3.  
• In the event of an IRR, the infusion of patisiran may be stopped and the patient closely 
monitored until resolution of the reaction.  Drugs that may be used to facilitate resolution and 
permit resumption of patisiran administration include, but are not limited to: 
paracetamol/acetaminophen (or equivalent), additional histamine H1/H2 receptor antagonists 
(eg, ranitidine), NSAIDs, adrenaline, supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and/or corticosteroids. 
• Following resolution of a mild or moderate IRR that required interruption of the patisiran 
infusion, resumption of administration may occur at the Investigator’s discretion at a slower 
infusion rate (but not to exceed 3 hours) for that dose and for all subsequent doses of

no more than 6 hours from the initial start of the infusion.   
• Patisiran administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe IRR until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
• If after consultation with the Medical Monitor it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid 
premedication  will be increased then the following steps are recommended : 
1) If the IRR occurred while the patient received [ADDRESS_454860] 60 minutes before the infusion and/or 5 mg oral dexamethasone or equivalent the night before the intravenous infusion.  
2) Increased dose of premedication steroids should NOT exceed the combination of 20 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent on the day of infusion and 8 mg oral dexamethasone or equivalent taken the night before the infusion.  
3) If the IRR occurred while the patient received less than 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, then the patient should return to the prior dose of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent that did not result in an IRR. 
Patients will be instructed to call the Investigator if they experience symptoms such as fever, chills, myalgia, or nausea/vomiting after discharge from the site.  
6.5. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator  or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
patisiran  supplied for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will be 
kept of the weight used to calculate each dispensed patisiran dose, and when and how much patisiran  is dispensed and used by [CONTACT_231759].  Any reasons for departure from the 
protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded. 
Drug accountability records and inventory will be available for verification by [CONTACT_95346]. 
Further instructions about drug accountabilit y are detailed in the patisiran  Pharmacy Manual.

9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
9.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Disease progression (including worsening of neuropathy impairment) will not be considered an 
AE. 
All IRRs will be recorded as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious AE (S AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that a t any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred; it does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death)  
385
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol   Version 2.1 -Brazil (Amendment 1)  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  43 • Requires inpatien t hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192109] (eg, such events 
include allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions, or the development of drug depend ency or abuse)  
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
Causal relationship assessment to drug treatments is required for purposes of reporting AEs.  To 
promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration along with 
good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the relationship of drug treatments to an AE: 
Definitely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which cannot be explai ned by [CONTACT_9153].  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible. 
Possibly Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to the medication admi nistration, but which could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, 
chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology.  
9.4. Recording Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC). 
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other findings. 
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below.  
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
daily activity.

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)  ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 2.1 -Brazil (Amendment 1)  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  44 Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
9.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported after the first dose of patisiran  regardless of their relationship to patisiran administration through the end of the 
study. 
Any medical condition that is present when the patient enters this extension study and does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it does deteriorate at any time during 
the study, it should be reported as an AE. 
All AEs must be fully recorded in the site’s source records and in the patients’ CRF, whether or 
not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE should be described in detail: onset time 
and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
Adverse events should be followed through the end of study visit or u ntil recovery to the normal 
state has been achieved, whichever occurs first.  In the event of a patient not returning to the 
clinical unit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost to follow-up. 
For patients who withdraw from the study early, ong oing AEs will be followed until resolution 
or [ADDRESS_454873].  SAEs will be followed by [CONTACT_364529]. 
9.5.1. Serious Adverse Event Reportin g 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the above seriousness criteria (Section  [IP_ADDRESS])  must be 
reported immediately to the CRO, always within [ADDRESS_454874] the following information:  
•Patient’s study number
•Description and date of onset of the event
•Criterion for serious
•Preliminary assignment of causality
Serious AE reporting will be via electronic data capture (EDC).

A Multicenter, Open -label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long- Term Safety and 
Efficacy of Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy who have 
Completed a Prior Clinical Study with Patisiran  
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to add the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS) to the study assessments, which was inadvertently left out of previous versions of the 
protocol. The inclusion of the C-SSRS addresses a regulatory requirement to prospectively 
assess suicidali ty in clinical trials involving all drugs for neurological indications.  Overall, this 
amendment includes the following changes: 
• The Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale has been added as an assessment of suicidal 
ideation and behavior. 
• Country- specific versions of the protocol have been integrated in order to increase 
consistency in the execution of the clinical study globally 
• Electroretinograms are now recommended to be performed in the case of suspected 
retinal disease. 
• The premedication regimen has be en updated to align with commercially available doses.  
• Blood samples for long-term storage have been added in order to permit future exploratory investigations. 
• During scheduled phone contact, clinical sites may now ask patients who are receiving 
home infusions about their general experience receiving these infusions  
A detailed summary of the above changes, in addition to changes made for clarity, is provided in Table 1.  Corrections to abbreviations, typographical errors and formatting are not detailed.

Title of Study:  
A Multicenter, Open -Label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long- term Safety and Efficacy of 
Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Who Have Completed a Prior Clinical 
Study with Patisiran  
Study Centers:  
This study will be conducted at multiple sites worldwide that have enrolled patients in a previous patisiran  study.  
Objectives : 
To assess the safety and efficacy of long -term dosing with patisiran in transthyretin -mediated 
amyloidosis ( ATTR ) patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy ( FAP). 
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, multinational, open- label extension study to evaluate the long- term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran  intravenously ( IV) 
once e very 21  (±3) days for the duration of the study.  In order to maintain the every 21-day dosing 
schedule from the parent study , patients are expected to have their first visit (Day 0) in this study [ADDRESS_454908] every 30 (±5) days .  Patients will also have visits at the clin ical site 
at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_454909] these 
efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites [CAS]”); these sites can also dose and 
manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites 
[PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS for their [ADDRESS_454910] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be contin ually 
assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs) .  Unscheduled visits for study assessments may 
occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518].

Safety:  
Safety assessments will include monitoring for AEs  (including serious AEs  [SAEs]); clinical laboratory 
tests, including hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing ; measurement of anti -
drug antibodies (if clinically indicated); vital signs; physical examinations; and ophthalmology 
examinations. 
Statistica l methods:  
This is an open-label extension study enrolling patients who have previously completed a patisiran 
study; the size of the study is not determined via power analysis of particular hypotheses tests.  
Efficacy analyses will examine between - and within -subject rates of change over time.  For the subset 
of patients that have previously received placebo  in the parent study, comparisons for the various 
efficacy assessments will be made between rates of change pre- and post-administration of patisiran, 
and relative to the treatment group in the parent study.  Additional exploratory analyses will compare 
rates of change with rates estimated from previous studies, including cross- sectional, natural history, 
and interventional studies of other drugs.  Associations between pharmacodynamic and efficacy data 
will be explored via correlation.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical efficacy data, clinical laboratory data, vital signs data, and ECG interval data, presented as both actual values and changes from baseline relative to each 
on-study evaluation.  Laboratory shift tables from baseline to worst values will be presented.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
Transthyretin -mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant, systemic 
disease caused by a mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene leading to the extracellular 
deposition of amyloid fibrils containing both mutant and wild type (WT) TTR.1,2 The particular 
TTR mutation and site of amyloid deposition determines the clinical manifestations of the disease, which include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy.  AT TR is a progressive disease associated with severe morbidity, with a life 
expectancy limited to 5 to 15  years from symptom onset.
3 There are over 100 reported TTR 
mutations which are associated with 2 clinical syndromes: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy  
(FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC).4,5,[ADDRESS_454936] common causative mutation of FAP is TTR Val30Met 
(V30M), with the onset of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_192106] 30 and 55 years of age.9 
Reduction of circulating amyloidogenic TTR improves outcomes in patients with FAP.  Orthotopic liver transpla ntation, which eliminates mutant TTR from the circulation, has 
improved survival in early stage FAP patients .
10  The TTR tetramer stabilizer tafamidis 
(Vyndaqel®) was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of stage 1 FAP based on evidence that it may slow neuropathy progression in these patients, but has not been approved for use in other regions of the world.  Diflunisal, a generic, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that is also a tetramer stabilizer , exhibits slowing of neuropathy progression in FAP 
patients, but is not standardly used among practitioners.  Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for a potent and effective therapy for FAP that will have an impact on patients across a 
broad range of neurologic impairment, regardles s of their mutation.  
1.2. Patisiran  
Patisiran (the International Nonproprietary Name [INN] name [CONTACT_364609] -TTR02) is a novel investigational agent being developed for the treatment of ATTR 
patients with symptomatic FAP .  Patisiran comprises a small interfering ribonucleic acid 
(siRNA) which is specific for TTR, and is formulated in a hepatotropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) for intravenous (IV) administration.
11 It is designed to significantly suppress liver production of 
both WT and all mutant forms of TTR, thereby [CONTACT_364583].  
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of patisiran were 
evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies that have enabled chronic dosing in clinical 
studies.  A summary of the nonclinical data can be found in the patisiran Investigators Brochure (IB).  
In a Phase 1 study of patisiran in healthy volunteers (Study ALN- TTR02 -001), patisiran wa s 
generally well tolerated .  Significant pharmacology in terms of TTR protein lowering (>80% 
reduction from pretreatment baseline) was observed at doses ≥0.15 mg/kg .  TTR levels showed 
evidence of recovery at Day 28 and return to baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 70.  A Pha se 1 study in healthy

subjects of Japanese origin (Study ALN- TTR02 -005) also showed dose dependent reduction in 
serum TTR, similar to that observed in Study ALN- TTR02 -001 in Caucasian subjects; patisiran 
was safe and well tolerated up to 0.3 mg/kg.  An ope n-label Phase 2 multiple ascending dose 
study of patisiran in ATTR patients with FAP (Study ALN -TTR02 -002) was conducted to 
determine the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a 60 or 70 minute IV 
infusion of patisiran administered once every 3 or 4 weeks for 2 doses.  The top dose of 
0.3 mg/kg administered every 3 or 4 weeks was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, with maximum TTR knockdown of ~90% and sustained TTR suppression of >80% most 
consistently observed with every 3 week dosing.  Twenty seven of the 29 patients treated on the 
Phase 2 trial enrolled in an open-label extension study (ALN- TTR02 -003) to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of long -term dosing with patisiran for approximately [ADDRESS_454937] been generally safe and well -tolerated on the -003 study, with preliminary data 
indicating no changes in liver function tests, renal function, or hematologic parameters, and no treatment -related discontinuations.  Sustained suppression of serum TTR of >80% has been 
observed in the open- label extension study, and preliminary clinical data at 6 months showed 
evidence for disease stabilization.
12  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study of patisira n (ALN -TTR02 -004; APOLLO) is ongoing worldwide.  The main objectives of 
the study are to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of patisiran and to establish the safety of chronic dosing in ATTR patients with FAP.  Further details on the clinical studies of patisiran can be found in the patisiran IB. 
1.3. Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study designed  to evaluate the long -term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  
The nonclinical data and clinical experience with patisiran support the continuation of patisiran 
treatment in this long -term extension study for ATTR patients with FAP.  All patients will 
receive patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV every [ADDRESS_454938] completed a 
prior study with patisiran (provided they meet the eligibility criteria of this study), including 
those previously on placebo, to receive open- label patisiran.  Patients coming on to this open -
label study from a blinded study will remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment until 
at least database lock has occurred in that study.  The duration of the study has been determined 
to allow the collection of long- term safety, tolerability and efficacy  data of patisiran in patients 
with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  The estimated duration of the study is [ADDRESS_454939] that lowering of the

nonclinical and clinical data that showed suppression in levels of WT and mutant TTR upon 
administration of 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every [ADDRESS_454941] a clinical benefit in FAP patients with mild to moderate polyneuropathy and that 
further study is warranted.  
In completed and ongoing clinical studies (ALN- TTR02 -001, ALN- TTR02 -[ADDRESS_454942]-
TTR02 -003), single and multiple doses of patisiran have been generally well tolerated.  Potential 
risks of patisiran include the following:  
• Infusion- Related Reactions  
Infusion- related reactions (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain 
biological agents such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the 
potential for an IRR with patisiran, all patients in this study will be premedicated p rior to 
dosing with patisiran .  The step -wise infusion regimen over approximately 70 minutes 
(starting with a slower infusion rate of approximately 1  mL/minute for the first 15 
minutes before increasing to 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion), ma y further 
reduce the risk of an IRR.  
• Liver function test abnormalities  
In preclinical studies, patisiran -related increased serum liver markers and histopathology 
in the liver were observed at dosages > 0.1 mg/kg in rats and > 1.0 mg/kg in monkeys.  In gene ral, all of the findings were not observed or were observed at lower severity at the 
end of the 60-[ADDRESS_454943] been no clinically significant changes in l iver function 
tests in either the single -dose or multiple-dose studies. Patients in the study are monitored 
for liver function via serial laboratory assessments.  
• Vitamin A Lowering  
The suppression of serum levels of TTR and RBP is expected to result in the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical and clinical data have shown that the lowering of circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does not result in severe 
vitamin A deficiency.  Furthermore, there are individuals with RBP/ TTR mutations who 
have life- long low levels of circulating vitamin A and are essentially in good health, 
suggesting that there are compensatory transport mechanisms for vitamin A that are yet undescribed.

Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran IV once 
every [ADDRESS_454947] a window of ± [ADDRESS_454948] visit (D ay 0) o n this study [ADDRESS_454949] 60 minutes before the start of the patisiran infusion .  Patisiran will be 
administered as a 70 -minu te IV infusion (approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 -minutes 
followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion).   If the infusion 
duration for a patient was lengthened beyond 70 minutes due to the occurrence of an IRR while 
on the parent study, that infusion duration may  be continued on this study for that particular 
patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site for patisiran dosing once every 
21 (±3) days, or receive the patisiran infusions at home by a healthcare professional trained on 
the protocol and delivery of premedication s and patisiran .  Patients who are receiving patisiran 
infusions at home will have a phone contact [CONTACT_364522] 30 (±5) days.  Patients 
will also have visits at the clinical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_454950] these efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites

assessments may occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518].  
3.2. Number of Patients  
All patients who have previously completed a patisiran study may be enrolled if they meet the eligibility criteria for this study.  
3.3. Treatment Assignment  
All patients enrolled in this study will receive open -label patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV 
once every 21 (±3) days. 
The Investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_344354] (IRS) (via phone 
or web) after confirmi ng that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria .  The patient will then  be assigned a patient number that corresponds to their 
current patient number on the parent study.  A combination of the center number, parent study number, enrollment number, and patient initials will create the unique patient identifier.  In 
countries with regulations prohibiting the use of patient initials, a strategy consistent with local regulations will be used to generate replacement val ues for the patient initials.  
3.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study may be terminated if patisiran does not obtain marketing approval or the development 
of patisiran is no longer being pursued by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
any time.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all 
documentation and patisiran supplied for the study must be returned to the Sponsor  or its 
representative, and th e Investigators, Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) / Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure

4.3. Patient Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without penalty to their continuing medical care.   For those patients who withdraw, every effort will be made to 
determine their reason for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248], and to complete the Early Withdrawal visit.  
The Investigator may withdraw a patient from the study if the patient:  
•Is in violation of the protocol
•Experiences a serious or intolerable AE
•Becomes pregnant
•Requires a prohibited medication (see Section 5.2)
•Requests to be withdrawn from the study
•Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol-required patisiran dosing
visits
The Investigator will withdraw patient s from the study upon the request of the Sponsor, 
including if the Sponsor terminates the study.  Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, 
the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor before discontinuing the patient. 
Missing an occasional dose of patisiran  will not necessarily result in the patient being withdrawn 
from the study.  However, if a patient misses [ADDRESS_454957] and on the case report form (CRF).  
In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study, the clinical  research organization (CRO) 
Medical Monitor must be informed immediately.

patisiran, there were no effects on mating, fertility, ovarian or uterine parameters, or fetal 
development despi[INVESTIGATOR_364488] (-88% from baseline) in serum vitamin A in the dams dosed with 
the rat -specific TTR surrogate siRNA . 
In this study, women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, cannot be 
breastfeeding, and must be using [ADDRESS_454958] dose of patisir an in this study.  
Highly effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year).  
Acceptable forms of effective contraception are defined as follows:  
• Hormonal:  established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or tran sdermal hormonal 
methods of conception 
• Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Placement of an intrauterine system (IUS)  
• Mechanical/barrier method of contraception:  condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault cap) in conjunction with spermicide  (foam, gel, film, cream or 
suppository) 
Note:  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not 
highly effective forms of contraception.  Therefore the use of additional spermicides 
does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  However, spermicides 
alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073] .  
Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be 
used alone. 
• Surgical sterilization of male partne r (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient); 
• Sexual true abstinence: when this is in line with t he preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Patients should be instructed to use [ADDRESS_454959] 
above.  Examples of 2 forms of highly effective contraception are as follows:  
• Oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives in conjunction with 
condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• IUD in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• Surgical sterilization of partner in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide  
Interaction between patisiran  and hormonal contraceptives is not anticipated.  The patisiran drug 
substance ALN -[ZIP_CODE] (siRNA), and the 2 novel lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 1,2- Dilinoleyloxy -N,N-

CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5).  In addition, there was no induction of CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at any of the concentrations studied.  These data suggest a low likelihood 
of patisiran  to interfere with the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives. 
Males (including men who have had vasectomies) with pa rtners of child -bearing potential, must 
agree to use 1 barrier method (eg, condom) and 1 additional method (eg, spermicidal foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository) of contraception throughout study participation and for 75 days 
(ie, a whole spermatogenic c ycle) after the last dose of patisiran in this study.  Males must also 
abstain from sperm donation after the first dose of patisiran through study participation and for 
[ADDRESS_454960] dose of patisiran in this study.

[DSPC ], cholesterol, and PEG 2000-C-DMG in isotonic phosphate buffered saline.  Patisiran 
Solution for Injection contains 2 mg/mL of the TTR siRNA drug substance. 
5.2. Concomitant Medications  
Use of the following medications/treatments is prohibited during study participation: 
• Any investigational agent other than patisiran  
• Corticosteroids other than those administered as premedications prior to the dose of 
patisiran, those used to treat an infusion reaction, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_124374].  
However, for patients with chronic inflammatory disorders (eg, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis), systemically administered steroids may be permitted provided that: 1) the 
dose is <20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent if administered chronically , or 2) for 
doses ≥20 mg/day, administration is limited to no more than 5 consecutive days.  
Use of the medications/treatments listed below is permitted in patients who were already taking such medications while on the parent study in accordance with the rules of that study protocol.  
For patients who did not take these medications  while on the parent study, use of these 
medications is permitted, if necessary, only after the patient has completed the 52- week visit.  
• Tafamidis  
• Diflunisal 
• Doxycycline/TUDCA  
Medications and treatments other than those specified above, including palliative and supportive 
care approved by [CONTACT_364525]-related symptoms, are permitted during the study. 
All patients will be asked to continue to take an oral daily supplement containing the 
recommended daily allowance of vitamin A.  
Any concomitant medication or treatment that is required for the patient’s welfare may be given 
by [CONTACT_737].  Use of all concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded on the 
patient’s CRF through the end of the patient’s participation in the study.  This will include all prescription drugs, herbal preparations, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and 
minerals.  Any changes in medications during the study will also be  recorded on the CRF. 
Similarly, concomitant medications that continue from the parent study will be entered into the 
database.

5.3. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with patisiran  administration is dependent on the proper preparation and 
administration of IV in fusions by [CONTACT_364526] .  Compliance with patisiran  administration will be verified through 
observation by [CONTACT_364555].  A dose will b e considered 
completed if 80% or more of the total volume of the IV solution was administered to the patient.  
Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of patisiran ; however , if a patient misses 
3 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consul tation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss 
whether the patient will be able to continue on the study. 
5.4. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a n open- label study ; however, patients rolling over into this study from a previously 
blinded study will remain blind to their previous treatment assignment until database lock has 
occurred in that study.

6. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
6.1. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and the preparation of patisiran will be in compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) specifications, as described in the Manufacture of Investigational Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_454961] is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 5.5 mL.   The 
container closure system consists of a [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia (USP/EP) Type I borosilicate glass vial, a Teflon -faced butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium 
flip-off cap.  
6.2. Study Drug Storage  
Patisiran  will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5 ± 3oC.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions must be reported to the CRO and/or the Sponsor and use of 
the patisiran  halted until authorization for its continued use has been given by [CONTACT_95346].  
No special procedures for the safe handling of patisiran are required.  A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, 
and records.  
Patisiran  supplied for this study may no t be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. 
6.3. Study Drug Preparation  
Staff at each clinical  site or the healthcare professional administering patisiran  will be 
responsible for preparation of patisiran doses, according to procedures detailed in  the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
All patients in this study will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days (± 3 days).  The 
amount (mg) of patisiran to be administered will be  based on the patient’s body weight (kg).  For 
each dose administered, the weight obtained during the previous dosing visit will be used to 
calculate the dose of patisiran .  In the event that the weight obtained on the previous dosing day 
is not available, the weight obtained pre-dose on the current dosing day can be used for dose calculation.  Patients who weigh 105 kg or more will receive patisiran dosing based on an assumption of a body weight of 104 kg. 
Patisiran will be prepared under aseptic conditions.  The total amount to be infused into each 
patient at each dosing visit will be 200 mL.  Sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be added to a sterile infusion bag, and the calculated volume of patisiran  will be withdrawn from the vials and 
injected into the infusion bag.

• Intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg) or equivalent 
• Oral paracetamol/acetaminoph en (500 mg) or equivalent 
• Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2 
blocker dose) 
• Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker available at the clinical  site).  Hydroxyzine or fexofenadine 25 mg per os (PO, orally) 
or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient who does not tolerate IV 
diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker. 
Further details (including a table of equivalent premedications) can be found in the patisiran  
Pharmacy Manual.  
Patients will be started on the above premedication regimen.   However, modifications may be 
made to the premedication regimen after consultation with  the medical monitor either due  to a 
patient’s inability to tolerate one or more of the premedications or to the occurrence of IRRs unresponsive to slowing of the infusion rate. 
• If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the steroid premedication regimen (e.g., patient 
develops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status , or other complic ation ), then 
lowering of the steroid premedication may be allowed for that patient after consultation with the medical monitor.   
• If after consultation with the medical monitor, it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid premedication  will be lowere d, then the following steps must be followed : 
1) If the current steroid dosage is 10 mg or less of  intravenous dexamethasone or 
equivalent, then the patient may be lowered in increments no greater than 2.5 mg 
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent. 
2) After each incremental lowering of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, the patient 
must receive three consecutive intravenous doses of patisiran without IRR and continued 
signs or symptoms of steroid intolerance before further reductions in steroid premedications.   
3) The premedication steroid dosage should not be reduced below 5 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent. 
Alternatively if a patient experiences an IRR when 10 mg or less of IV dexamethasone or 
equivalent is used as the steroid premedicati on, then proceed to Section 6.4.3. 
If a patient’s premedication regimen was modified prior to enrollment in Study TTR02 -006, the 
patient may continue on that modified premedication regimen.

Clinical Protocol                                        Version 2. 1 (Amendment 1 - [LOCATION_009] and [LOCATION_013] ) 17 December 201 5 
6.4.2. Study Drug Administration 
Patisiran will be administered under the supervision of the site personnel every 21 (±3) days.  
Patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_454963] patisiran administered at home , where 
applicable country and local regulations allow.  Home administration of patisiran will be done 
according to a site -specific plan  by a healthcare profess ional trained  on the protocol and delivery 
of premedications and patisiran. 
On all dosing days, patisiran will be administered as a 70 -minute IV infusion (approximately 
1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3  mL/minute for the remainder 
of the infusion). 
• If the patient experiences an IRR the infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the 
event of a mild or moderate IRR. 
1) If the patient experiences a mild or moderate IRR that resolves by [CONTACT_364579].  
2) If the patient experiences a severe IRR, then  patisiran administration will not be resumed 
until the case is discussed with the M edical Monitor (see Section  6.4.3).   
• If the infusion time for a patient was already extended on the parent study due to an IRR, that 
modified infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular patient.  
Returning the patient’s inf usion duration to 70 minutes will require a discus sion with the 
Medical Monitor. 
• For the first 3 infusions of patisiran on this study, the patient’s infusion site should be assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the end of the infusion, and the patient will remain at the clinical site for 1 hour following 
completion of dosing. 
If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran  within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will 
be considered missed and not adm inistered.  
Additional details  can be found in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual.  
In addition to study treatment, patients will receive  the recomme nded daily allowance of 
vitamin  A in  an oral supplement. 
6.4.3. Suggested Guideli nes for Management of Infusion-R elated Reactions  
Criteria for categorizing IRRs are provided in Appendix 3 . 
• In the event of an IRR, the infusion of patisiran may be stopped and the patient closely 
monitored until resolution of the reaction.  Drugs that may be used to facilitate resolution and 
permit resumption of patisiran administration include, but are not limited to: 
paracetamol/acetaminophen (or equivalent), additional histamine H1/H2 receptor antagonists 
(eg, ranitidine), NSAIDs, adrenaline, supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and/or corticosteroids. 
• Following resolution of a mild or moderate IRR that required interruption of the patisiran 
infusion, resumption of administration may occur at the Investigator’s discretion at a slower infusion rate (but not to exceed 3 hours) for that dose and for all subsequent doses of

patisiran.  If the infusion is delayed, the administration of the infusion should be completed 
no more than 6 hours from the initial start of the infusion.   
• Patisiran administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe IRR until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
• If after consultation with the M edical M onitor it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid 
premedication  will be increased then the following steps are recommended : 
1) If the IRR occurred while the patient received [ADDRESS_454964] 60 min utes before the infusion and/or 5 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent the night before the intravenous infusion.  
2) Increased dose of premedication steroids should NOT exceed the combination of 20 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent on the day of infusion and 8 mg oral dexamethasone or equivalent taken the night before the infusion.  
3) If the IRR occurred while the patient received less than 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, then the patient should return to the prior dose of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent that did not result in an IRR. 
Patients will be instructed to call the Investigator if th ey experience symptoms such as fever, 
chills, myalgia, or nausea/vomiting after discharge from the site.  
6.5. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator  or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
patisiran  supplied for this s tudy,  including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will be 
kept of the weight used to calculate each dispensed patisiran dose, and when and how much patisiran  is dispensed and used by [CONTACT_231759].  Any reasons for departure from the 
protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded.

visit.  A  subset of the efficacy assessments performed  at 52 weeks will be performed annually 
thereafter.   The specific timing for each assessment is presented in  Table 1 . 
For the 52- week time  point, a central neurologic testing core facility will review the data derived 
from the various neuropathy measures at each participating site to ensure compliance with testing procedures and quality of the data.  A central echocardiography core lab will analyze the 
echocardiogram data.  A core lab will be responsible for processing and analyzing skin punch 
biopsy samples.  Magnetic resonance (MR) neurography data (when performed)  will also be 
centrally read.  
Further details on performing the efficacy assessments will be provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
8.1.1. Neurological Testing  
Neurological  testing will be performed and the results of these tests will be used to  calculate the 
Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS), modified NIS ( mNIS+7 ), and NIS+7 , at the time points 
specified  in Table 1 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified Neurological Impairment Score +7  and Neurological Impairment 
Score +7  
The mNIS+7 assessment tool is a composite measure of neurologic impairment which includes 
the following measures: 
• Clinical exam -based NIS  (weakness and reflexes)  
• Electrophysiologic measures of small and large nerve fiber function (+7) including: 
− Nerve conduction studies ( NCS ) 5 attributes ( Σ5) 
− Quantitative  sensory testing ( QST ) by [CONTACT_364518] 
(TP) and heat pain ( HP) 
• Autonomic function (postural blood pressure) 
Neurologic impairment will also be assessed by [CONTACT_192121]+7.  The NIS+7 consists of the following 
measures:  
• Full NIS (including weakness, sensation, and reflexes) 
• Electrophysiologic measures of small and large nerve fiber function (+7) including: 
− NCS Σ5 
− Vibration  detection threshold ( VDT ) 
• Heart rate response to deep breathing ( HRdb )

The scoring and components of the mNIS+7 and NIS+7 are summarized in Appendix 4 .  
Components that are shared between the mNIS+7 and NIS+7 (including NIS and NCS) will be 
performed once at each assessment.  
Every effort will be made to use the same devices for NCS , QST, and VDT for a patient 
throughout the duration of the study. 
For each pati ent, 2 independent assessments of the mNIS+7 and NIS+[ADDRESS_454966] 24 hours (approximately) 
apart from each other but no greater than [ADDRESS_454967] these assessments at 
the Week 52 visit performed by [CONTACT_364556].  Assessments of the NIS 
during the annual visit (after the Week 52 visit) must be performed by a neurologist. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Neurological Impairment Score 
At each time point when only the f ull NIS  is required, 1 assessment of the NIS will be performed 
at a CAS or PCS.  
8.1.2. Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Stage and Polyneuropathy Disability 
Score  
Changes in ambulation will be evaluated through the polyneuropathy dis ability ( PND) score and

Every effort will be made to use the same dynamometer for a patient on both assessment days.  
8.1.8. Composite Autonomic Symptom Score  
To evaluate changes in autonomic symptoms, patients will complete the Composite Autonomic 
Symptom Score ( COMPASS  31) questionnaire.  The questionnaire consists of 31 clinically 
selected questions evaluating 6  autonomic domains (orthostatic intolerance, secretomotor, 
gastrointestinal, bladder, and pupi[INVESTIGATOR_10440]). 
8.1.9. Norfolk Quality of Life - Diabetic Neuropathy Questionnaire  
Quality of life will be assessed through the Norfolk Quality of Life - Diabetic Neuropathy 
(QOL -DN) questionnaire, a standardized 47- item patient -reported outcomes measure that is 
sensitive to the different features of diabetic neuropathy (DN) -small fiber, large fiber, and 
autonomic nerve function. 
Patients who are entering this study from a protocol that does not include the Norfolk QOL- DN 
questionnaire ( eg, ALN -TTR02 -003) will not complete this assessment.

9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
9.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associa ted with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Disease progression (including worsening of neuropathy impairment) will not be considered an 
AE. 
All IRRs will be recorded as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious AE (S AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred; it does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_364509]  42

prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, such events 
include allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions, or the development 
of drug dependency or abuse) 
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
Causal relationship assessment to drug treatments is required for purposes of reporting AEs.  To 
promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration along with 
good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the relationship of drug treatments to an 
AE: 
Definitely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible. 
Possibly Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information 
on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely Related:  A clinical event, i ncluding laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abn ormality, that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative etiology.  
9.4. Recording Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC). 
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other findings. 
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below.  
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
daily activity.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity f or the experience that day

Clinical Protocol                Version 2. 1 (Amendment 1 - [LOCATION_009] and [LOCATION_013] ) 17 December 201 5 
should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
9.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported after the first dose of patisiran  regardless of their relationship to patisiran administration through the end of the 
study. 
Any medical condition that is present when the patient enters this extension study and does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it does deteriorate at any time during the study, it should be reported as an AE. 
All AEs must be fully recorded in the site’s source records and in the patients’ CRF, whether or 
not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE should be described in detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
Adverse events should be followed through the end of study visit or until recovery to the normal 
state has been achieved, whichever occurs first.  In the event of a patient not returning to the 
clinical unit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost to follow-up. 
For patients who withdraw from the study early, ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution 
or [ADDRESS_454975].  SAEs will be followed by [CONTACT_364584]. 
9.5.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE and laboratory abnormality that meets the above seriousness criteria (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) must be 
reported immediately to the CRO, always within [ADDRESS_454976] the following information:  
•Patient’s study number
•Description and date of onset of the event
•Criterion for serious
•Preliminary assignment of causality
Serious AE reporting will be via electronic data capture (EDC).

14.1. Case Report Forms  
The Investigator and designees agree to maintain accurate CRFs and source documentation as 
part of these case histories.  Source documents are the originals of any documents used by [CONTACT_192162][INVESTIGATOR_307]/institution that allow verification of the existence of the patient and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected during the trial.  
The Sponsor will supply CRFs for each patient.  Case report forms must be completed only by 
[CONTACT_192163].  Corrections must be made so as not to obliterate original 
data and must be identified and dated by [CONTACT_364541].  All data entered 
into the CRF must also be available in the source documents.  The Investigator will allow designated Sponsor representatives and regulatory bodies to have direct access to the source 
documents to verify the data reported in the CRFs. 
Each completed CRF must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_192164] a timely 
manner.  The completed CRF will be the records maintained by [CONTACT_1034].  A copy of the CRF 
will remain in the Investigator’s files.  
14.2. Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ anonymity will be maintained.  On the CRFs or 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_111242], but by [CONTACT_192172].  If patient names are included on copi[INVESTIGATOR_364492], the names (except for initials) will be obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for 
submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintained by [CONTACT_144759]. 
Following the principles of the GCP, if local regulations specify a patient’s number and initials 
will be used to identify the patient on their study records.  Laboratory samples may be labeled 
with an independent numbering code, and the label will not contain any other personal identification information.  The numbering code associated with these labels will be held by [CONTACT_364543], thereby [CONTACT_192174].  The 
numbering code will also be held for samples in storage until marketing approval of patisiran in the countries where this study was conducted, or until clinical development of patisiran is halted.  
Throughout sample collection, storage (limited, staff only access area containing locked sample 
storage, and limited access sample tracking) and processing, the samples will only be handled by [CONTACT_192175]’s standard operating procedures. 
The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compi[INVESTIGATOR_144668], whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor must approve any transfer of information not directly involved in the study.

Appendix 3: Categorization of Infusion- Related Reactions  
 
Signs and symptoms of an infusion-related reaction (IRR) usually develop dur ing or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
Signs/symptoms may include: allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever), arthralgia 
(joint pain), bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, dyspnea (shortness of breath), fatigue (asthenia, 
lethargy, malaise), headache, hypertension, hypotension, myalgia (muscle pain), nausea, pruritus/itching, rash/desquamation, rigors/chills, sweating (diaphoresis), tachycardia, urticaria 
(hives, welts, whea ls), vomiting.  
Categorization of IRRs is as follows: 
 
Categorization Description  
Mild  Mild reaction:  infusion may be continued; if intervention is indicated 
it is minimal and additional treatment (other than paracetamol for delayed reactions) is not required. 
Moderate  Moderate reaction:  requires treatment including more intensive 
therapy (eg, IV fluids, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug 
[NSAIDs]) in addition to infusion interruption but responds promptly 
to medication.  Treatment is indicated for ≤24 hours. 
Severe  More than moderate reaction:  not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_192114]; and/ or prolonged (treatment is indicated for >24 hours); recurrence of severe symptoms following initial 
improvement.

Summary of Changes (dated 05 January 2017)  
compared to Protocol Version  2.2 - Japan (dated 14 March  2016) 
A Multicenter, Open -label, Extension Study to Evaluate t he Long -Term Safety and 
Efficacy of Patisiran i n Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy who have 
Completed a Prior Clinical Study with Patisiran  
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to add the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS) to the study assessments, which was inadvertently left out of previous versions of the 
protocol. The inclusion of the C-SSRS addresses a regulatory requirement to prospectively 
assess suicidality in clinical trials involving all drugs for neurological indications.  Overall, this 
amendment includes the following changes: 
• The Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale has been added as an assessment of suicidal 
ideation and behavior. 
• Country-specific versions of the protocol have been integrated in order to increase 
consistency in the execution of the clinical study globally 
• Electroretinograms are now recommended to be performed in the case of suspected 
retinal disease.  
• The premedication regimen has been updated to align with commercially available doses.  
• Blood samples for long-term storage have been added in order to permit future exploratory investigations. 
• During scheduled phone contact, clinical sites may now ask patients who are receiving 
home infusions about their general experience receiving these infusions  
A detailed summary of the above changes, in addition to changes made for clarity, is provided in Table 1.  Corrections to abbreviations, typographical errors and formatting are not detailed.

Study with Patisiran  
Study Centers:  
This study will be conducted at multiple sites worldwide that have enrolled patients in a previous patisiran study.  
Objectives:  
To assess the safety and efficacy of long -term dosing with patisiran in transthyretin -mediated 
amyloidosis (ATTR) patients with familial amyloidotic polyne uropathy (FAP). 
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, extension study to evaluate the long- term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran intravenously (IV) 
once every 21  (±3) days for the duration of the study.  In order to maintain the every-21-day dosing 
schedule from the prior clinical study (APOLLO stu dy), patients are expected to have their first visit 
(Day 0) in this study [ADDRESS_455013] these efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites [CAS]”); these sites can also dose and 
manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites 
[PCS])”, while sending  the patients to the nearest CAS for their [ADDRESS_455014] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be continually 
assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs).  Unscheduled visits for study assessments may 
occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518].

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
Transthyretin -mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant, systemic 
disease caused by a mutation in the transthyretin  (TTR) gene leading to the extracellular 
deposition of amyloid fibrils containing both mutant and wild type (WT) TTR.1,2 The particular 
TTR mutation and site of amyloid deposition determines the clinical manifestations of the 
disease, which include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy.  ATTR is a progressive disease associated with severe morbidity, with a life 
expectancy limited to 5 to 15  years from symptom onset.
3 There are over 100 reported TTR 
mutations which are as sociated with 2 clinical syndromes: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy 
(FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC).4,5,[ADDRESS_455039] common causative mutation of FAP is TTR Val30Met 
(V30M), with the onset of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_192106] 30 and 55 years of age.9 
Reduction of circulating amyloidogenic TTR improves outcomes in patients with FAP.  
Orthotopic liver transplantation, which eliminates mutant TTR from the circulation, has improved survival in early stage FAP patients.
10  The TTR tetramer stabilizer tafamidis 
(Vyndaqel®) was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of s tage 1 FAP based 
on evidence that it may slow neuropathy progression in these patients, but has not been approved for use in other regions of the world.  Diflunisal, a generic, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that is also a tetramer stabilizer,  exhibits slowing of neuropathy progression in FAP 
patients, but is not standardly used among practitioners.  Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for a potent and effective therapy for FAP that will have an impact on patients across a 
broad range of neurologic impairment, regardless of their mutation.  
1.2. Patisiran  
Patisiran (the International Nonproprietary Name [INN] name [CONTACT_364609] -TTR02) is a novel investigational agent being developed for the treatment of ATTR 
patien ts with symptomatic FAP.  Patisiran comprises a small interfering ribonucleic acid 
(siRNA) which is specific for TTR, and is formulated in a hepatotropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) for intravenous (IV) administration.
11 It is designed to significantly suppress liver production of 
both WT and all mutant forms of TTR, thereby [CONTACT_364552].  
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of patisiran were 
evaluated in a series of in vitro  and in vivo  studies that have enabled chronic dosing in clinical 
studies.  A summary of the nonclinical data can be found in the patisiran Investigators Brochure (IB).  
In a Phase 1 study of patisiran in healthy volunteers (Study ALN- TTR02 -001), patisiran was 
generally well tolerated.  Significant pharmacology in terms of TTR protein lowering (>  80% 
reduction from pretreatment baseline) was observed at doses ≥  0.15 mg/kg.  TTR levels showed 
evidence of  recovery at Day 28 and return to baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 70.  A Phase 1 study in healthy

subjects of Japanese origin (Study ALN- TTR02 -005) also showed dose dependent reduction in 
serum TTR, similar to that observed in Study ALN- TTR02 -001 in Caucasian subjects; pa tisiran 
was safe and well tolerated up to 0.3 mg/kg.  An open- label Phase 2 multiple ascending dose 
study of patisiran in ATTR patients with FAP (Study ALN -TTR02 -002) was conducted to 
determine the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a 60 or 70 minute IV 
infusion of patisiran administered once every 3 or 4 weeks for 2 doses.  The top dose of 
0.3 mg/kg administered every 3 or 4 weeks was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, with maximum TTR knockdown of ~90% and sustained TTR suppression of > 80% most 
consistently observed with every 3 week dosing.  Twenty seven of the 29 patients treated on the 
Phase 2 trial enrolled in an open-label extension study (ALN- TTR02 -003) to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of long -term dosing with p atisiran for approximately [ADDRESS_455040] been generally safe and well -tolerated on the -003 study, with preliminary data 
indicating no changes in liver function tests, renal function, or hematologic parameters, and no treatment -related discontinuations.  Sustained suppression of serum TTR of > 80% has been 
observed in the open-label extension study, and preliminary clinical data at 6 months showed evidence for disease stabilization.
12  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controll ed Phase 3 
study of patisiran (ALN- TTR02 -004; APOLLO) is ongoing worldwide.  The main objectives of 
the study are to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of patisiran and to establish the safety of chronic dosing in ATTR patients with FAP.  Further details on the clinical studies of patisiran can be found in the patisiran IB. 
1.3. Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study designed to evaluate the long- term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  
The nonclinical data and clinical experience with patisiran support the continuation of patisiran treatment in this long -term extension study for ATTR patients with FAP.  All patients will 
receive patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered  IV every [ADDRESS_455041] completed a prior study with patisiran (provided they meet the eligibility criteria of this study), including those previously on placebo, to receive open- label patisiran.  Patients coming on to this open -
label study from a blinded study will remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment until at least database lock has occurred i n that study.  The duration of the study has been determined 
to allow the collection of long- term safety, tolerability and efficacy data of patisiran in patients 
with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  The estimated duration of the study is [ADDRESS_455042] that lowering of the

nonclinical and clinical data that showed suppression in levels of WT and mutant TTR upon 
administration of 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every [ADDRESS_455044] a clinical benefit in FAP patients with mild to moderate polyneuropathy and that 
further study is warranted.  
In completed and ongoing clinical studies (ALN- TTR02 -001, ALN- TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455045]-
TTR02 -003), single and multiple doses of patisiran have been generally well tolerated.  Potential 
risks of patisiran include the following:  
• Infusion- Related Reactions  
Infusion- related reactions (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain biological 
agents  such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the potential for an 
IRR with patisiran, all patients in this study will be premedicated prior to dosing with 
patisiran.  The step -wise infusion regimen over approximately 70 minutes (starting with a 
slower infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes before increasing to 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion), may further reduce the risk of an IRR. 
• Liver function test abnormalities   
In preclinical studies, patisiran -related increased serum liver markers and histopathology in 
the liver were observed at dosages > 0.1 mg/kg in rats and > 1.0 mg/kg in monkeys.  In 
general, all of the findings were not observed or were observed at lower severity at the end of the 60-[ADDRESS_455046] been no clinically significant changes in liver function tests in 
either the single -dose or multiple -dose studies. Patients in the study are monitored for liver 
function via serial laboratory assessments.  
• Vitamin A Lowering  
The suppression of serum levels of TTR and RBP is expected to result in the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical and clinical data have shown that the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does not result in severe vitamin A deficiency.  Furthermore, there are individuals with RBP/TTR mutations who have life- long 
low levels of circulating vitamin A and are essentially in go od health, suggesting that there 
are compensatory transport mechanisms for vitamin A that are yet undescribed.

vitamin A by [CONTACT_192135]/her first dose of patisiran.  
• Osteoporosis

Further guidance to the investigator can be found in the IB.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of long- term dosing with patisiran 
in ATTR patients with FAP.  
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a multicenter, multinational, open -label extension study to evaluate the long- term safety 
and efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran IV once 
every [ADDRESS_455050] a window of ± 3 days.  In 
order to maintain the every 21-day dosing schedule from the  prior clinical study (APOLLO 
study), patients are expected to have their first visit (Day 0) on this study [ADDRESS_455051] 60 minutes before the start of the patisiran infusion.  Patisiran will be 
administered as a 70 -minute IV infusion (approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 -minutes 
followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion).  If the infusion 
duration for a patient was lengthened beyond 70 minutes due to the occurrence of an IRR while 
on the APOLLO  study, that infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular 
patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the 
Medical Mon itor. 
After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site for patisiran dosing once every 21 (±3) days .  Patients will also have visits at the clinical site at approximately 12, 26 and 52 
weeks, and yearly thereafter.

manage the patients(“Patient Care Sites [PCS]”), while sending the patients to the nearest CAS 
for their [ADDRESS_455053] year and yearly thereafter.  Patient s will be 
continually assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs).  Unscheduled visits for study assessments may occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518].  
3.2. Number of Patients  
All patients who have previously completed a patisiran study ma y be enrolled if they meet the 
eligibility criteria for this study.  
3.3. Treatment Assignment  
All patients enrolled in this study will receive open -label patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV 
once every 21 (±3) days. 
The Investigator or his/her delegate will c ontact the interactive response system (IRS) (via phone 
or web) after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria. The patient will then be assigned a patient number that corresponds to their current p atient number on APOLLO  study. A combination of the center number, APOLLO 
study number, enrollment number, and patient initials will create the unique patient identifier. In countries with regulations prohibiting the use of patient initials, a strategy consistent with local regulations will be used to generate replacement values for the patient initials.  
3.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study may be terminated if patisiran does not obtain marketing approval or the development 
of patisiran is no longer be ing pursued by [CONTACT_364590], Inc.  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or 
administrative reasons at any time.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all documentation and patisiran supplied for the study must be returned to 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or the CRO , and the Investigators, Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) / Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed 
of the termination and the reason for the decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the 
patients and assure appropriate therapy and follow-up.

4.3. Patient Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without penalty to 
their continuing medical care.  For those patients who withdraw, every effort will be made to determine their reason for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248], and to complete the Early Withdrawal visit. 
The Investigator may withdraw a patient from the study if the patient:  
•Is in violation of the protocol
•Experiences a serious or intolerable AE
•Becomes pregnant
•Requires a prohibited medication (see Section 5.2)
•Requests to be withdrawn from the study
•Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol-required patisiran dosing
visits
The Investigator will withdraw patients from the study upon the request of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., including if Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. terminates the study.  Upon 
occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, the Investigator will confer with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. before discontinuing the patient. 
Missing an occasional dose of patisiran will not necessarily result in the patient being withdrawn 
from the study.  However, if a patient misses [ADDRESS_455059] an d on the case report form (CRF). 
In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study, the clinical research organization (CRO) 
Medical Monitor must be informed immediately.

Women of child- bearing potential are defined as any woman or adolescent who has begun 
menstruation. A post-menopausal woman is defined as a woman who has 12 months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels > 
40 mIU/mL or [ADDRESS_455061] dose of patisiran in this study.  
Highly effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year).  Acceptable forms of effective contraception are defined as follows:  
• Hormonal:  established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of conception 
• Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Placement of an intrauterine system (IUS)  
• Mechanical/barrier method of contraception:  condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault cap) in conjunction with spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or suppository) 
Note:  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not 
highly effective forms of contraception.  Therefore the use of additional sper micides 
does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  However, spermicides alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073].  Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be 
used alone. 
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient); 
• Sexual true abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Patients s hould be instructed to use [ADDRESS_455062] 
above.  Examples of 2 forms of highly effective contraception are as follows:  
• Oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives in conjunction with 
condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• IUD in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• Surgical sterilization of partner in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide  
Interaction between patisiran and hormonal contraceptives is not anticipated.  The patisiran drug substance ALN -[ZIP_CODE] (siRNA), and the 2 novel lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 1,2- Dilinoleyloxy -N,N-

dimethylpropylamine (DLin -MC3 -DMA) and ( R)-methoxy- PEG 2000-carbamoyl -di-O- myristyl -
sn-glyceride  (PEG -2000-C-DMG), were evaluated by  [CONTACT_364554] P450 (CYP) activity.  None of the 
components displayed an inhibitory effect on any of the CYPs investigated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5).  In addition, there was no induction of CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at any of the concentrations studied.  These data suggest a low likelihood 
of patisiran to interfere with the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives.  
Males (including men who have had vasectomies) with partners of child-b earing potential, must 
agree to use 1 barrier method (eg, condom) and 1 additional method (eg, spermicidal foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository) of contraception throughout study participation and for 75 days (ie, a whole spermatogenic cycle) after the l ast dose of patisiran in this study.  Males must also 
abstain from sperm donation after the first dose of patisiran through study participation and for [ADDRESS_455063] appr opriate contraception method in Japan as 
available.

5. TREATMENT OF PATIENT S 
5.1. Description of Study Drug  
Patisiran Solution for Injection is a ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) therapeutic consisting 
of an siRNA targeting TTR messenger RNA (mRNA) formulated in a LNP.  The patisiran drug product is a sterile formulation of ALN -[ZIP_CODE], an siRNA targeting TTR, formulated as LNPs 
siRNA with lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (DLin -MC3 -DMA, 1,2- Distearoyl -sn-glycero -3-phosphocholine  
[DSPC], cholesterol, and PEG
2000-C-DMG in isotonic phosphate buffered saline.  Patisiran 
Solution for Injection contains 2 mg/mL of the TTR siRNA drug substance. 
5.2. Concomitant Medications  
Use of the following medications/treatments is prohibited during study participation: 
• Any investigational agent other than patisiran  
• Corticosteroids other than those administered as premedications prior to the dose of patisiran, those used to treat an infusion reaction, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_124374].  
However, for patients with chronic inflammatory disorders (eg, asthma, rheumatoid 
arthritis), systemically administered steroids may be permitted provided that: 1) the dose is < 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent if administered chronically, or 2) for 
doses ≥  20 mg/day, administration is limited to no more than 5 consecutive days. 
Use of the medications/treatments listed below is permitted in patients who were already taking 
such medications while on the APOLLO study in accordance with the rules of that study protocol.  For patients who did not take these medications while on the APOLLO study, use of 
these medications is permitted, if necessary, only after the patient has completed the 52 -week 
visit.  
• Tafamidis  
• Diflunisal 
• Doxycycline/TUDCA  
Medications and treatments other than those specified above, including palliative and supportive 
care approved by [CONTACT_364525]-related symptoms, are permitted during the study. 
All patients will be asked to continue to take the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. 
Patients will receive this daily dose for the duration of their par ticipation in the study while being 
administered patisiran. The Japan clinical sites will provide the subjects with a prescription for vitamin A.  
Any concomitant medication or treatment that is required for the patient’s welfare may be given 
by [CONTACT_11856].  Use of all concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded on the 
patient’s CRF through the end of the patient’s participation in the study.  This will include all 
prescription drugs, herbal preparations, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and 
minerals.  Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the CRF.

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol   Version 2.2 -Japan  
 
Similarly, concomitant medications that continue from the APOLLO study will be entered into 
the database.  
5.3. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with patisiran  administration is dependent on the proper preparation and  
administration of IV infusions by [CONTACT_364591].  Compliance with patisiran administration will be verified through observation by [CONTACT_464].  A dose will be considered completed if 80% or more of the 
total volume of the IV solution was administered to the patient.  Patients will be permitted to 
miss an occasional dose of patisiran; however, if a patient misses 3 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss whether the patient will be 
able to continue on the study. 
5.4. Randomization and Blinding  
This is an open- label study; however, patients rolling over into this study fro m a previously 
blinded study will remain blind to their previous treatment assignment until database lock has occurred in that study. 
6. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
6.1. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and the preparation of patisiran will be in compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) specifications, as described in the Manufacture of Investigational Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_455064] is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 5.5 mL .  The 
container closure system consists of a [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia (USP/EP) Type I borosilicate glass vial, a Teflon -faced butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium 
flip-off cap.  
6.2. Study Drug Storage  
Patisiran will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5 ± 3oC.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions must be reported to the CRO and/or Alnylam 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and use of the patisiran halted until authorization for its continued use has 
been given by [CONTACT_364590], Inc. or its designee.  
No special procedures for the safe handling of patisiran are required.  An Alnylam 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the 
supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
Patisiran supplied for this study may not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study.

Clinical Protocol   Version 2.2 -Japan  
 
6.3. Study Drug Preparation  
Staff at each clinical site or the healthcare professional administering patisiran will be 
responsible for preparation of patisiran doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  
All patients in this study will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days (±3 days).  The amount (mg) of patisiran to be administered will be  based on the patient’s body weight (kg).  For 
each dose administered, the weight obtained during the previous dosing visit will be used to 
calculate the dose of patisiran.  In the event that the weight obtained on the previous dosing day 
is not available, the weight obtained pre-dose on the current dosing day can be used for dose calculation.  Patients who weigh 105 kg or more will receive patisiran dosing based on an 
assumption of a body weight of 104 kg. 
Patisiran will be prepared under aseptic conditions.  The total amount to be infused into each 
patient at each dosing visit will be 200 mL.  Sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be added to a 
sterile infusion bag, and the calculated volume of patisiran will be withdrawn from the vials and 
injected into the infusion bag. 
6.4. Admin istration  
6.4.1. Premedication  
Prior to each dose of patisiran, patients will receive the following premedications in order to 
reduce the risk of experiencing an IRR at least 60 minutes before the infusion: 
• Intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg) or equivalent 
• Oral paracetamol/acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent 
• Intravenous H 2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H 2 
blocker dose) 
• Intravenous H 1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H 1 blocker 
available at the clinical site).  Hydroxyzine or fexofenadine 25 mg per os (PO, orally) 
or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient who does not tolerate IV diphenhydramine or other IV H
1 blocker. 
Further details (including a table of equivalent premedications) can be fo und in the patisiran 
Pharmacy Manual.  
Patients will be started on the above premedication regimen.  However, modifications may be 
made to the premedication regimen after consultation with the medical monitor either due to a 
patient’s inability to tolerate one or more of the premedications or to the occurrence of IRRs unresponsive to slowing of the infusion rate. 
• If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the steroid premedication regimen (e.g., patient 
develops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status, or other complication), then 
lowering of the steroid premedication may be allowed for that patient after consultation with 
the medical monitor.  
Alnylam Pharmaceu ticals  Confidential  29 
511
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol   Version 2.2 -Japan  
 
• If after consultation with the medical monitor, it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid 
premedication will be lowered, then the following steps must be followed : 
1) If the current steroid dosage is 10 mg or less of intravenous dexamethasone or 
equivalent, then the patient may be lowered in increments no greater than 2.5 mg 
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent. 
2) After each incremental lowering of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, the patient 
must receive three consecutive intravenous doses of patisiran without IRR and continued 
signs or symptoms of steroid intolerance before further reductions in steroid 
premedications.   
3) The premedication steroid dosage should not be reduced below 5 mg intravenous 
dexamethasone or equivalent. 
Alternatively if a patient experiences an IRR when 10 mg or less of IV dexamethasone or 
equivalent is used as the stero id premedication, then proceed to Section 6.4.3. 
If a patient’s premedication regimen was modified prior to enrollment in Study TTR02 -006, the 
patient may continue on that modified premedication regimen. 
6.4.2. Study Drug Administration 
Patisiran  will be administered under the supervision of the site personnel every 21 (±3) days. 
On all dosing days, patisiran will be administered as a 70 -minute IV infusion (approximately 
1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3  mL/minute fo r the remainder 
of the infusion). 
• If the patient experiences an IRR the infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the 
event of a mild or moderate IRR. 
1) If the patient experiences a mild or moderate IRR that resolves by [CONTACT_364592].  
2) If the patient experiences a severe IRR, then patisiran administration will not be resumed until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor (see Section  6.4.3).   
• If the infusion time for a patient was already extended on the APOLLO  study due to an IRR, 
that modified infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the 
Medical Monitor. 
• For the first 3 infusions of patisiran on this study, the patient’s infusion site should be assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 m inutes after the 
end of the infusion, and the patient will remain at the clinical site for 1 hour following completion of dosing. 
If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will 
be considered missed and not administered.  
Additional details can be found in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual.

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol   Version 2.2 -Japan  
 
In addition to study treatment, patients will receive  the recommended daily allowance of 
vitamin  A.  Patients will receive this daily dose for the duration of their participation in the study 
while being administered patisiran.  The Japan clinical sites will provide the subjects with a 
prescription for vitamin A.  
6.4.3. Suggested Guidelines for Management of Infusion- Related Reactions  
Criteria for categorizing IRRs are provided in Appendix 3.  
• In the event of an IRR, the infusion of patisiran may be stopped and the patient closely monitored until resolution of the reaction.  Drugs that may be used to facilitate resolution and 
permit resumption of patisiran administration include, but are not limited to: 
paracetamol/acetaminophen (or equivalent ), additional histamine H
1/H2 receptor antagonists 
(eg, ranitidine), NSAIDs, adrenaline, supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and/or corticosteroids. 
• Following resolution of a mild or moderate IRR that required interruption of the patisiran 
infusion, resumption of administration may occur at the Investigator’s discretion at a slower 
infusion rate (but not to exceed 3 hours) for that dose and for all subsequent doses of patisiran.  If the infusion is delayed, the administration of the infusion should be completed 
no more than 6 hours from the initial start of the infusion.   
• Patisiran administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe IRR until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
• If after consultation with the Medical Monitor it is a greed that an individual patient’s  steroid 
premedication will be increased then the following steps are recommended : 
1) If the IRR occurred while the patient received [ADDRESS_455065] 60 minutes before the infusion and/or 5 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent the night before the intravenous infusion.  
2) Increased dose of premedication steroids should NOT exceed the combination of 20 mg 
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent on the day of infusion and 8 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent taken the night before the infusion.  
3) If the IRR occurred while the patient received less than 10 mg intravenous 
dexamethasone or equivalent, then the patient should return to the prior dose of 
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent that did not result in an IRR. 
Patients will be instructed to call the Investigator if they experience symptoms such as fever, 
chills, myalgia, or nausea/vomiting after discharge from the site.  
6.5. Study Drug Accountability  
The investigator or the responsible pharmacist for study drug (designated according to the Japan 
local r egulations) will maintain accurate records of the receipt and condition of patisiran supplied 
for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will be kept of the weight 
used to calculate each dispensed patisiran dose, and when and how much patisiran is dispensed 
Alnylam Pharmaceu ticals  Confidential  31

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455066] also be recorded. 
Drug accountability records and inventory will be available for verification by [CONTACT_364593], Inc. or its designee. 
Further instructions about drug accountability are detailed in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual. 
6.6. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
All used, partially used, and unused vials of patisiran will be returned to Alnylam 
Pharmaceutical s, Inc. or its designee/depot or destroyed at the site according to applicable 
regulations. 
Patisiran supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study.  
Drug that has been dispensed for a patient and returned unused must not be redispensed. 
7. PHARMACOKINETIC ASSE SSMENTS  
No PK assessments will be performed in this study.  
8. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
8.1. Efficacy Parameters  
Efficacy assessments may be performed at Day [ADDRESS_455067] over 2 days.  Patients will not receive study drug at this 
visit.  A subset of the efficacy assessments performed at 52 weeks will  be pe rformed annually 
thereafter.  The specific timing for each assessment is presented in  Table 1 . 
For the 52- week time point, a central neurologic testing  core facility will review the data derived 
from the various neuropathy measures at each participating site to ensure compliance with testing procedures and quality of the data.  A central echocardiography core lab will analyze the 
echocardiogram data.  A core lab will be responsible for processing and analyzing skin punch 
biopsy samples.  
Further details on performing the efficacy assessments will be provided in the Study Reference 
Manual.  
8.1.1. Neurological Testing  
Neurological testing will be performed and the  results of these tests will be used to calculate the 
Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS), modified NIS (mNIS+7), and NIS+7, at the time points specified in  Table 1 .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Modified Neurological Impairment Score +7 and Neurological Impairment 
Score +7  
The mNIS+7 assessment tool is a composite measure of neurologic impairment which includes 
the following measures: 
• Clinical exam -based NIS (weakness and reflexes)  
• Electrophysiologic measures of small and large nerve fiber function (+7) including: 
− Nerve conduction studies (NCS) 5 attributes (Σ5)  
− Quantitative sensory testing (QST) by [CONTACT_364518] 
(TP) and heat pain (HP)  
• Autonomic function (postural blood pressure) 
Neurologic impairment will also be assessed by [CONTACT_192121]+7.  The NIS+7 consists of the following 
measures:  
• Full NIS (including weakness, sensation, and reflexes) 
• Electrophysiologic measures of small and large nerve fiber function (+7) including: 
− NCS Σ5 
− Vibration detection threshold (VDT) 
• Heart rate response to deep breathing (HRdb) 
The scoring and components of the mNIS+7 and NIS+7 are summarized in Appendix 4.  
Components that are shared between the mNIS+7 and NIS+7 (including NIS and NCS) will be 
performed once at each assessment.  
Every effort will be made to use the same devices for NCS, QST, and VDT for a patient 
throughout the duration of the study. 
For each patient, 2 independent assessments of the mNIS+7 and NIS+[ADDRESS_455068] 24 hours (approximately) 
apart from each oth er but no greater than [ADDRESS_455069] these assessments at 
the Week 52 visit performed by [CONTACT_364556].  Assessments of the NIS during the annual visit (after the Week 52 visit) must be performed by a neurologist. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Neurological Impairment Score 
At each time point when only the full NIS is required, 1 assessment of the NIS will be performed 
at a CAS or PCS.  
8.1.2. Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Stage and Polyneuropathy Disability 
Score  
Chan ges in ambulation will be evaluated through the polyneuropathy disability (PND) score and 
FAP stage (see Appendix 5 and Appendix 6,  respectively).

(IENFD) and sweat gland nerve fiber density (SGNFD).  For patients who had skin biopsies on 
the APOLLO study and who have provided additional voluntary consent for skin biopsy on this 
study, 2 sets of tandem 3-mm skin punch biopsies (4 biopsies total) for IENFD and SGNFD will be obtained at each time point.  One set of biopsies will be taken from the distal lower leg, when 
a patient’s clinical status allows, and 1 set from the distal thigh.  
Details on sample collection, processing, and storage will be provided in the Study Laboratory 
Manual.  
Skin biopsies will be performed at a CAS or PCS. 
8.1.4. Modified Body Mass Index  
Sites will measure body weight on all dosing days.  Using that data, the modified body mass 
index (mBMI) will be calculated (BMI × albumin) programmatically in the clinical database and 
does not need to be performed at the study center.

Further details regarding the ophthalmology examinations will be provided in the Study 
Reference Manual.  
9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adver se Events  
9.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatme nt. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal produc t. 
Disease progression (including worsening of neuropathy impairment) will not be considered an AE. 
All IRRs will be recorded as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
Alnylam Pharmaceu ticals  Confidential  38 
520
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol   Version 2.2 -Japan  
 
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred; it does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110256]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30506] (eg, such events include allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions, or the development 
of drug dependency or abuse) 
9.3. Relationship to Study D rug 
Causal relationship assessment to drug treatments is required for purposes of reporting AEs.  To 
promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration along with 
good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the relationship of drug treatments to an 
AE: 
Definitely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_364594].  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible. 
Possibly Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information 
on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal relationship to medication admin istration, and which other drugs, 
chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology.  
9.4. Recording Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC). 
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other findings. 
Adverse events are to be graded acco rding to the categories detailed below. 
Alnylam Pharmaceu ticals  Confidential  39 
521
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol   Version 2.2 -Japan  
 
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
daily activity.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of 
an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
9.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported after the first 
dose of patisiran regardless of their relationship to patisiran administration through the end of the 
study.  
Any medical condition that is present when the patient enters this extension study and does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it does de teriorate at any time during 
the study, it should be reported as an AE. 
All AEs must be fully recorded in the site’s source records and in the patients’ CRF, whether or 
not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE should be described in detail: ons et time 
and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
Adverse events should be followed through the end of study visit or until recovery to the normal 
state has been achieved, whichever occurs first.  In the event of a patient not returning to the clinical unit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost to follow -up. 
For patients who withdraw from the study early, ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution or [ADDRESS_455076].  SAEs will be followed by [CONTACT_192155]. 
9.5.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An assessmen t of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the above seriousness criteria (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) must be 
reported immediately to the CRO, always within [ADDRESS_455077] the f ollowing information: 
• Patient’s study number 
• Description and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of causality

9.5.2. Pregnancy Report ing 
A female patient must have a negative pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_455081] dose of patisiran, the Investigator should report 
the pregnancy to the CRO within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form.  Treatment with patisiran will be 
discontinued in any patient who is found to be pregnant during the study.  The patient should 
receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723].  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), then the Investigator should follow the 
procedures for reporting an SAE outlined above. 
Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a patient participating in the study should also be reported 
to the Investigator, who will then report this to the CRO and follow to outcome as described 
above.

A copy of the certificate of insurance as a measure to compensation for health damages will be 
submitted to the IRB/IEC if required. 
14. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
14.1. Case Report Forms  
The Investigator and designees agree to maintain accurate CRFs and source documentation as 
part of these case histories.  Source documents are the originals of any documents used by [CONTACT_364539][INVESTIGATOR_307]/institution that allow verification of the existence of the patient and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected during the trial.  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  will supply CRFs for each patient.  Case report forms must be 
completed only by [CONTACT_192163].  Corrections must be made so as not to obliterate original data and must be identified and dated by [CONTACT_364541].  All data entered into the CRF must also be available in the source documents.  The 
Investigator will allow the CRO and regulatory bodies to have direct access to the source 
documents to verify the data reported in the CRFs. 
Each completed CRF must be rev iewed and signed by [CONTACT_192164] a timely 
manner.  The completed CRF will be the records maintained by [CONTACT_364590], Inc.   
A copy of the CRF will remain in the Investigator’s files.  
14.2. Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ anonymity will be maintained.  On the CRFs or 
other documents submitted to Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  or designees, patients should not be 
identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_192172].  If patient names are 
included on copi[INVESTIGATOR_364510], Inc.  or designees, the 
names (except for initials) will be obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for submission to Alnylam Pharmaceuticals , Inc. (eg, signed ICFs) 
should be maintained by [CONTACT_30379]. 
Following the principles of the GCP, if local regulations specify a patient’s number and initials 
will be used to identify the patient on their study records.  Laborato ry samples may be labeled 
with an independent numbering code, and the label will not contain any other personal 
identification information.  The numbering code associated with these labels will be held by [CONTACT_364598], Inc. , thereby [CONTACT_364599].  The numbering code will also be held for samples in storage until marketing 
approval of patisiran in the countries where this study was conducted, or until clinical 
development of patisiran is halted.  Throughout sample collection, storage (limited, staff only access area containing locked sample storage, and limited access sample tracking) and 
processing, the samples will only be handled by [CONTACT_192175]’s 
standard operating procedures.

14.4. Retention of Records 
Essential documents should be retained for the period of time required by [CONTACT_310548].  
The essential documents include the signed and dated final protocol, signed and dated 
amendments(s), if applicable, signed and dated curricula vitae of the Investigators, copi[INVESTIGATOR_364500], signed ICFs, IEC/ IRB approval  and all related correspondence, financial 
agreements, regulatory approval, drug accountability, study correspondence, and patient 
identification codes.  Records will not be destroyed without informing Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. in writing and giving Al nylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  the opportunity to store the records for 
a longer period of time at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ’s expense.  
The ICH requires that patient identification codes be retained for at least [ADDRESS_455087] 
been received and analyzed by [CONTACT_364590], Inc. , or the study has been t erminated 
at all centers.  A separate, individual publication of the results of the study will be delayed until initial publication of the results of the multicenter study, or a decision not to publish is made.  If an initial draft is not produced within 18 months of completion of the study at all centers, or the 
timeframe for publication is not satisfactory, the Investigator may disclose the results after 
providing a copy and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  confirms receipt of the manuscript 30 days 
before s ubmission. 
Research ancillary to this main protocol may not be performed by [CONTACT_364600], Inc.

Appendix 3: Categorization of Infusion- Related Reactions  
 
Signs and symptoms of an infusion- related reaction (IRR) usually develop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
Signs/symptoms may include: allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever), arthralgia 
(joint pain), bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, dyspnea (shortness of breath), fatigue (asthenia, 
lethargy, malaise), headache, hypertension, hypotension, myalgia (muscle pain), nausea, pruritus/itching, rash/desquamation, rigors/chills, sweating (diaphoresis), tachycar dia, urticaria 
(hives, welts, wheals), vomiting. 
Categorization of IRRs is as follows: 
 
Categorization Description  
Mild  Mild reaction:  infusion may be continued; if intervention is indicated 
it is minimal and additional treatment (other than paracetamol for delayed reactions) is not required. 
Moderate  Moderate reaction:  requires treatment including more intensive 
therapy (eg, IV fluids, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug 
[NSAIDs]) in addition to infusion interruption but responds promptly 
to medication .  Treatment is indicated for ≤24 hours. 
Severe  More than moderate reaction:  not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_192114]; and/ or prolonged (treatment is indicated for >24 hours); recurrence of severe symptoms following initial 
improvement.

Summary of Changes  
Protocol Version 2.2-Japan (Incorporating Japan- specific update), date d [ADDRESS_455095] 
Completed a Prior Clinical Study with Patisiran  
 
Rationale for the Japan Country- specific Protocol Amendment  
• The primary purpose of the Japan country-specific protocol amendment is to remove 
home infusion references and MR neurography scanning as these practices are not 
applicable in Japan, and to update the vitamin A dispensing requirments to better align with country- specific pharmacy practices.  
The following additional change was incorporated: 
• Changed reference from “parent study” to “APOLLO study”; this change is being 
implemented because only Japanese subjects from the APOLLO study (ALN -TTR02 -
004) will be rolling into this extension study ALN- TTR02 -006; none of the subjects 
participating in the other patisiran parent study (ALN -TTR02 -003) are from Japan.  
• The name [CONTACT_364616]- text as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.  
• Deleted from Section 13.2, text describing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) that is only applicable in the [LOCATION_002] of 
America.  
• New Section 13.4 was added to describe Compensation for Health Damage s according to 
local regulations.  
A detailed summary of changes is provided in Table  1.  Corrections to typographical errors, 
punctuation, grammar, abbreviations, and formatting (including administrative changes between protocol amendments 2.1 and 2.2) are not detailed.

Patisiran  
Title of Study:  
A Multicenter, Open -Label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long -term Safety and Efficacy of 
Patisiran  in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Who Have Completed a Prior Clinical 
Study with Patisiran  
Study Centers:  
This study will be conducted at multiple sites worldwide that have enrolled patients in a previous 
patisiran study.  
Objectives:  
To assess the safety and efficacy of long -term dosing with patisiran in transthyretin -mediated 
amyloidosis  (ATTR ) patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy  (FAP ). 
Methodology:   
This is a multicenter, multinational, open -label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have previously completed a patisiran study.  
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and rece ive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran intravenously ( IV) 
once every 21  (±3) days for the duration of the study.   In order to maintain the every 21-day dosing 
schedule from the parent study, patients are expected to have their first visit (Day 0) in this study [ADDRESS_455106] every 30 (±5) days .  Patients will also have visits at the clin ical site 
at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_455107] these 
efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites [CAS]”); these sites can also dose and 
manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites 
[PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS for their [ADDRESS_455108] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be continually 
assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs) .  Unscheduled visits for study assessments may 
occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518].

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  18 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Disease Overview  
Transthyretin -mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant, systemic 
disease caused by a mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene leading to the extracellular 
deposition of amyloid fibrils containing both mutant and wild type (WT) TTR.1,2 The particular 
TTR mutation and site of amyloid deposition determines the clinical manifestations of the 
disease, which include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or 
cardiomyopathy.  AT TR is a progressive disease associated with severe morbidity, with a life 
expectancy limited to 5 to 15 years from symptom onset.3 There are over 100 reported TTR 
mutations which are associated with 2 clinical syndromes: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy  
(FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC).4,5,[ADDRESS_455134] common causative mutation of FAP is TTR Val30Met 
(V30M), with the onset of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_192106] 30 and 55 years of age.9 
Reduction of circulating amyloidogenic TTR improves outcomes in patients with FAP.  Orthotopic liver transplantation, which eliminates mutant TTR from the circulation, has 
improved survival in early stage FAP patients .
10  The TTR tetramer stabilizer tafamidis 
(Vyndaqel®) was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of stage 1 FAP based 
on evidence that it may slow neuropathy progression in these patients, but has not been approved for use in other regions of the world.  Diflunisal, a generic, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that is also a tetramer stabilizer, exhibits slowing of neuropathy progression in FAP 
patients, but is not standardly used among practitioners.  Thus, there remains an unmet medical 
need for a potent and effective therapy for FAP that will have an impact on patients across a broad range of neurologic impairment, regardless of their mutation. 
1.2. Patisiran  
Patisira n (the International Nonproprietary Name [INN] name [CONTACT_364609] -TTR02) is a novel investigational agent being developed for the treatment of ATTR 
patients with symptomatic FAP .  Patisiran comprises a small interfering ribonucleic acid 
(siRNA) which is specific for TTR, and is formulated in a hepatotropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) for intravenous (IV) administration.
11 It is designed to significantly suppress liver production of 
both WT and all mutant forms of TTR, thereby [CONTACT_364552].  
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of patisiran were 
evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies that have enabled ch ronic dosing in clinical 
studies.  A summary of the nonclinical data can be found in the patisiran Investigators Brochure (IB).  
In a Phase 1 study of patisiran in healthy volunteers (Study ALN- TTR02 -001), patisiran was 
generally well tolerated .  Significant pharmacology in terms of TTR protein lowering (>80% 
reduction from pretreatment baseline) was observed at doses ≥0.15 mg/kg.  TTR levels showed evidence of recovery at Day 28 and return to baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 70.  A Phase 1 study in healthy 
560
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 2.1 -Japan  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  19 subjects of Japanese origin (Study ALN- TTR02 -005) also showed dose dependent reduction in 
serum TTR, similar to that observed in Study ALN- TTR02 -001 in Caucasian subjects; patisiran 
was safe and well tolerated up to 0.3 mg/kg.  An open- label Phase 2 multiple ascending dose 
study of patisiran in ATTR patients with FAP (Study ALN- TTR02 -002) was conducted to 
determine the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a 60 or 70 minute IV 
infusion of patisiran administered once every 3 or 4 weeks for 2 dos es.  The top dose of 
0.3 mg/kg administered every 3 or 4 weeks was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, 
with maximum TTR knockdown of ~90% and sustained TTR suppression of >80% most 
consistently observed with every 3 week dosing.  Twenty seven of the 29 patients treated on the Phase 2 trial enrolled in an open-label extension study (ALN- TTR02 -003) to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of long -term dosing with patisiran for approximately [ADDRESS_455135] been generally safe and well- tolerated on the -003 study, with preliminary data 
indicating no changes in liver function tests, renal function, or hematologic parameters, and no 
treatment-related discontinuations.  Sustained suppression of serum TTR of >80% has been 
observed i n the open-label extension study, and preliminary clinical data at 6 months showed 
evidence for disease stabilization.
12  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study of patisiran (ALN- TTR02 -004; APOLLO) is ongoing worldwide.  The main objec tives of 
the study are to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of patisiran and to establish the safety of chronic dosing in ATTR patients with FAP.  Further details on the clinical studies of patisiran 
can be found in the patisiran IB. 
1.3. Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study  designed to evaluate the long- term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have complete d a prior study with patisiran. 
The nonclinical data and clinical experience with patisiran support the continuation of patisiran 
treatment in this long -term extension study for ATTR patients with FAP.  All patients will 
receive patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV every [ADDRESS_455136] completed a 
prior study with patisiran (provided they meet the eligibility criteria of this study), including those previously on placebo, to receive open- label patisiran.  P atients coming on to this open-
label study from a blinded study will remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment until at least database lock has occurred in that study.  The duration of the study has been determined to allow the collection of lo ng-term safety, tolerability and efficacy  data of patisiran in patients 
with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  The estimated duration of the study 
is [ADDRESS_455137] that lowering of the

nonclinical and clinical data that showed suppression in levels of WT and mutant TTR upon 
administration of 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every [ADDRESS_455139] a clinical benefit in FAP patients with mild to moderate polyneuropathy and that 
further study is warranted.  
In completed and ongoing clinical studies (ALN- TTR02 -001, ALN- TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455140]-
TTR02 -003), single and multiple doses of patisiran have be en generally well tolerated.  Potential 
risks of patisiran include the following:  
• Infusion- Related Reactions 
Infusion- related reactions (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain biological 
agents such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the potential for an 
IRR with patisiran , all patients in this study will be premedicated prior to dosing with 
patisiran .  The step -wise infusion regimen over approximately 70 minutes (starting with a 
slower infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes before increasing to 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion), may further reduce the risk of an IRR. 
• Liver function test abnormalities   
In preclinical studies, p atisiran -related increased serum liver markers and histopathology in 
the liver w ere observed at dosages > 0.1 mg/kg in rats and > 1.0 mg/kg in monkeys.  In 
general, all of the findings were not observed or were observed at lower severity at the end of 
the 60- [ADDRESS_455141] been  no clinically significant  changes in  liver function tests  in 
either the single -dose or multiple-dose studies. Patients in the study are monitored for liver 
function via serial laboratory assessments.  
• Vitamin A Lowering  
The suppression of serum levels of TTR and RBP is expected to result in t he lowering of 
circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical and clinical data have shown that the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does not result in severe vitamin A deficiency.  Furthermore, there are individuals with RB P/TTR mutations who have life-long 
low levels of circulating vitamin A and are essentially in good health, suggesting that there are compensatory transport mechanisms for vitamin A that are yet undescribed.

The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of long -term dosing with patisiran 
in ATTR patients with FAP.  
564
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455145] previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will e nroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran IV once 
every [ADDRESS_455146] a window of ± [ADDRESS_455147] visit (D ay 0) on this study [ADDRESS_455148] 60 minutes before the start of the patisiran infusion.  Patisiran will be 
administered as a 70 -minu te IV infusion (approximately 1  mL/minute for the first 15 -minutes 
followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion).  If  the infusion 
duration for a patient was lengthened beyond 70 minutes due to the occurrence of an IRR while 
on the parent study, that infusion duration may  be continued on this study for that particular 
patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the 
Medical Monitor.  
After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site for patisiran dosing once every 
21 (±3) days, or receive the patisiran infusions at home by a healthcare professional trained on 
the protocol and delivery of premedication s and patisiran .  Patients who are receiving patisiran 
infusions at home will have a phone contact [CONTACT_364522] 30 (±5) days.  Patients 
will also have visits at the clinical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_455149] these efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites 
[CAS]”); these sites can dose and manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and 
manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites [PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS for their 52-week efficacy assessments.  Every effort should be made for the patient t o return to 
the same CAS center that the patient went to in the parent study .  Yearly efficacy assessments 
after the 52 -week visit may be done at a PCS.  Prior to starting the study, the CAS and PCS will 
create a delegation of responsibilities document tha t clearly details which site is responsible for 
565
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455150] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be 
continually assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs) .  Unscheduled visits for study 
assessments may occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518]. 
3.2. Number of Patients 
All patients who have previously completed a patisiran study may be enrolled if they meet the 
eligibility criteria for this study.  
3.3. Treatment Assignment 
All patients enrolled in this study will receive open-label patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV once every 21 (±3) days. 
The Investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_344354] (IRS) (via phone 
or web) after confirming that the  patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria .  The patient will then  be assigned a patient number that corresponds to their 
current patient number on the parent study.  A combination of the center number, parent study number, enrollment number, and patient initials will create the unique patient identifier.  In 
countries with regulations prohibiting the use of patient initials, a strategy consistent with local 
regulations will be used to generate replacement values for the patient initials.  
3.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study may be terminated if patisiran does not obtain marketing approval or the development of patisiran is no longer being pursued by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study  for clinical or administrative reasons at 
any time.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all 
documentation and patisiran supplied for the study must be returned to the Sponsor or its 
representative, and the Investiga tors, Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) / Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the 
reason for the decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure 
appropriate therapy and follow-up. 
566
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455151] meet the following criteria before administration of 
patisiran on Day 0:

unconjugated bilirubin with normal conjugated bilirubin) and the patient has ALT and AST 
levels within normal ranges. 
5. Have a serum creatinine ≤2 × ULN  
6. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, cannot be 
breastfeeding, and must be using [ADDRESS_455153] agree to use 1 barrier method 
(eg, condom) and 1 additional method (eg, spermicide) of contraception throughout study 
participation and for [ADDRESS_455154] dose of patisiran in this study ; males must also 
abstain from sperm donation after the first dose of patisiran  through study participation 
and for [ADDRESS_455155] dose of patisiran in this study  
8. Be willing and able to comply with the protocol-required visit schedule and visit 
requirements and provide written informed consent 
4.2. Patient Exclusion Criteria 
A patient will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria before dosing at the Day 0:  
1. Has an active infection requiring systemic antiviral or antimicrobial therapy that will not be completed before the first dose of patisiran  administration  
2. Has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus

regimen were previously allowed per the parent study 
6. Is under legal protection (defined as “any person who becomes incapable of protecting 
his/her interests due to a medically diagnosed impairment of his/her mental faculties that may limit or prevent the expression of his will” ), decided by a court 
4.3. Patient Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without penalty to 
their continuing medical care.   For those patients who withdraw, every effort will be made to 
determine their reason for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248], and to complete the Early Withdrawal visit.  
The Investigator may withdraw a patient from the study if the patient:  
• Is in violation of the protocol 
• Experiences a serious or intolerable AE  
• Becomes pregnant  
• Requires a prohibited medication (see Section 5.2 ) 
• Requests to be withdrawn from the study 
• Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol-required patisiran dosing visits  
The Investigator will withdraw patients from the study upon the request of the Sponsor, 
including if the Sponsor terminates the study.  Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor  before discontinuing the patient. 
Missing an occasional dose of patisiran  will not necessarily result in the patient being withdrawn 
from the study.  However, if a patient misses [ADDRESS_455156] and on the case report form (CRF).  
In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study, the clinical  research organization (CRO) 
Medical Monitor must be informed immediately.  
4.4. Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Restrictions / Contraception 
Requirements 
TTR transports vitamin A in plasma; therefore , reductions in circulating vitamin A levels 
accompany reductions in TTR caused by [CONTACT_364523].  Vitamin A deficiency has known effects on 
both male and female reproductive performance and embryo/fetal development.[ADDRESS_455157] been conducted in the rat 
and non-human primate ( NHP ) toxicology studies including a chronic NHP study in sexually 
mature animals, where there were no adverse effects in males (including sperm analyses and 
spermatogenic staging) or females.   In a dose range-finding rat embryo/fetal development study

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 2.1 -Japan  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  27 conducted with patisiran, there were n o effects on mating, fertility, ovarian or uterine parameters, 
or fetal development despi[INVESTIGATOR_364488] (-88% from baseline) in serum vitamin A in the dams 
dosed with the rat- specific TTR surrogate siRNA . 
Women of child-bearing potential are defined as any woman or adolescent who has begun 
menstruation. A post-menopausal woman is defined as a woman who has 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels >40 mIU/m L or [ADDRESS_455158] dose of patisiran in this study.  
Highly effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year).  
Acceptable forms of effective contraception are defined as follows:  
• Hormonal:  established  use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal 
methods of conception 
• Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Placement of an intrauterine system (IUS)  
• Mechanical/barrier method of contraception:  condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault cap) in conjunction with spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or 
suppository) 
Note:  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not 
highly effective forms of contraception.  Therefore the use of additional spermicides does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  However, spermicides 
alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073] .  
Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be 
used alone. 
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patien t); 
• Sexual true abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Patien ts should be instructed to use [ADDRESS_455159] 
above.  Examples of 2 forms of highly effective contraception are as follows:  
• Oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives in conjunction with 
condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• IUD in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• Surgical sterilization of partner in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455160] -[ZIP_CODE] (siRNA), and the 2 novel lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 1,2-Dilinoleyloxy- N,N-
dimethylpropylamine ( DLin -MC3 -DMA) and ( R)-methoxy- PEG 2000-carbamoyl-di-O- myristyl -
sn-glyceride  (PEG -2000-C-DMG), were evaluated by [CONTACT_364603] P450 (CYP) activity.  None of the 
components displayed an inhibitory effect on any of the CYPs investigated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5).  In addition, there was no induction of CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at any of the concentrations studied.  These data suggest a low likelihood of patisiran  to interfere with the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives.  
Males (including men who have had vasectomies) with partners of child -bearing potential, must 
agree to use 1 barrier method (eg, condom) and 1 additional method (eg, spermicidal foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository) of contraception throughout study participation and for 75 days (ie, a whole spermatogenic cycle) after the last dose of patisiran in this study.  Males must also 
abstain from sperm donation after the first dose of patisiran through study participation and for [ADDRESS_455161] appropriate contraception method in Japan as 
available.

Patisiran Solution for Injection is a ribonucleic acid interference ( RNAi ) therapeutic consisting 
of an siRNA targeting TTR messenger RNA ( mRN A) formulated in a LNP.  The patisiran drug 
product is a sterile formulation of ALN-[ZIP_CODE], an siRNA targeting TTR, formulated as LNPs  
siRNA with lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (DLin -MC3 -DMA, 1,2-Distearoyl -sn-glycero -3-phosphocholine  
[DSPC], cholesterol, and PEG 2000-C-D MG in isotonic phosphate buffered saline.  Patisiran 
Solution for Injection contains 2 mg/mL of the TTR siRNA drug substance.  
5.2. Concomitant Medications  
Use of the following medications/treatments is prohibited during study participation: 
• Any investigational agent other than patisiran  
• Corticosteroids other than those administered as premedications prior to the dose of 
patisiran, those used to treat an infusion reaction, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_124374].  
However, for patients with chronic inflammatory dis orders (eg, asthma, rheumatoid 
arthritis), systemically administered steroids may be permitted provided that: 1) the 
dose is <20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent if administered chronically, or 2) for 
doses ≥20 mg/day, administration is limited to no more than 5 consecutive days. 
Use of the medications/treatments listed below is permitted in patients who were already taking 
such medications while on the parent study in accordance with the rules of that study protocol.  
For patients who did not take these medications  while on the parent study, use of these 
medications is permitted, if necessary, only after the patient has completed the 52 -week visit.  
• Tafamidis  
• Diflunisal  
• Doxycycline/TUDCA 
Medications and treatments other than those specified above, including palliative and supportive care approved by [CONTACT_364525]-related symptoms, are permitted during the study. 
All patients will be asked to continue to take an oral daily supplement containing the 
recommended daily allowance of vitamin A.     Patients will receive this daily dose for the 
duration of their participation in the study while being administered patisiran . 
Any concomitant medication or treatment that is required for the patient’s welfare may be given by [CONTACT_737].  Use of all concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded on the 
patient’s CRF through the end of the patient’s participation in the study.  This will include all 
prescription drugs, herbal preparations, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and minera ls.  Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the CRF. 
Similarly, concomitant medications that continue from the parent study will be entered into the database.

Compliance with patisiran  administration is de pendent on the proper preparation and 
administration of IV infusions by [CONTACT_364526].  Compliance with patisiran  administration will be verified through 
observation by [CONTACT_3449] s taff or trained home healthcare professionals.  A dose will be considered 
completed if 80% or more of the total volume of the IV solution was administered to the patient.  Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of patisiran ; however, if a pa tient misses 
3 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss whether the patient will be able to continue on the study. 
5.4. Randomization and Blinding 
This is an open -label study; however, patients rolling over into this study from a previously

6.1. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling 
All packaging, labeling, and the preparation of patisiran will be in compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) specifications, as described in the Manufacture of Investigational 
Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_455162] is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 5.5 mL.  The 
container closure system consists of a [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia (USP/EP) Type I borosilicate glass vial, a Teflon -faced butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium 
flip-off cap.  
6.2. Study Drug Storage 
Patisiran  will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5 ± 3oC.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions must be reported to the CRO and/or the Sponsor and use of 
the patisiran  halted until authorization for its continued use has been given by [CONTACT_95346].  
No special procedures for the safe handlin g of patisiran are required.  A Sponsor representative 
or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, 
and records.  
Patisiran  supplied for this study may not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. 
6.3. Study Drug Preparation  
Staff at e ach clinical  site or the healthcare professional administering patisiran  will be 
responsible for preparation of patisiran doses , according t o procedures detailed in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
All patients in this study will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days (± 3 days).  The 
amount (mg) of patis iran to be administered will be  based on the patient’s body weight (kg).  For 
each dose administered, the weight obtained during the previous dosing visit will be used to 
calculate the dose of patisiran .  In the event that the weight obtained on the previous dosing day 
is not available, the weight obtained pre-dose on the current dosing day can be used for dose 
calculation.  Patients who weigh 105 kg or more will receive patisiran dosing based on an 
assumption of a body weight of 104 kg. 
Patisiran will be prepared under aseptic conditions.   The total amount to be infused into each 
patient at each dosing visit will be 200 mL.  Sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be added to a 
sterile infusion bag, and the calculated volume of patisiran  will be withdrawn from the vials and 
injected into the infusion bag. 
573
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455163] 60 minutes before the infusion: 
• Intravenous dexamethasone ( 10 mg) or equivalent 
• Oral paracetamol/acetaminoph en (500 mg) or equivalent 
• Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2 
blocker dose) 
• Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker available at the clinical site).  Hydroxyzine or fexofenadine 25 mg per os (PO, orally) 
or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient who does not tolerate IV 
diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker. 
Further details (including a table of equivalent premedications) can be found in the patisiran  
Pharmacy Manual.  
Patients will be started on the above premedication regimen.   However, modifications may be 
made to the premedication regimen after consultation with  the medical monitor either due  to a 
patient’s inability to tolerate one or more of the prem edications or to the occurrence of IRRs 
unresponsive to slowing of the infusion rate. 
• If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the steroid premedication regimen (e.g., patient 
develops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status, or other complic ation ), then 
lowering of the steroid premedication may be allowed for that patient after consultation with 
the medical monitor.   
• If after consultation with the medical monitor, it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid 
premedication  will be lowere d, then the following steps must be followed : 
1) If the current steroid dosage is 10 mg or less of  intravenous dexamethasone or 
equivalent, then the patient may be lowered in increments no greater than 2.5 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent. 
2) After each incremental lowering of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, the patient 
must receive three consecutive intravenous doses of patisiran without IRR and continued 
signs or symptoms of steroid intolerance before further reductions in steroid 
premedications.   
3) The premedication steroid dosage should not be reduced below 5 mg intravenous 
dexamethasone or equivalent. 
Alternatively if a patient experiences an IRR when 10 mg or less of IV dexamethasone or 
equivalent is used as the steroid premedicati on, then proceed to Section 6.4.3. 
If a patient’s premedication regimen was modified prior to enrollment in Study TTR02 -006, the 
patient may contin ue on that modified premedication regimen.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  33 6.4.2. Study Drug Administration  
Patisiran will be administered under the supervision of the site personnel every 21 (±3) days.  
Patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_455164] patisiran administered at home , where 
applicable country and local regulations allow.  Home administration of patisiran will be done according to a site- specific plan by a healthcare professional trained  on the protocol and delivery 
of premedications and patisiran . 
On all dosing days, patisiran will be administered as a 70 -minute IV infusion (approximately 
1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remain der 
of the infusion). 
• If the patient experiences an IRR the infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the 
event of a mild or moderate IRR. 
1) If the patient experiences a mild or moderate IRR that resolves by [CONTACT_364579]. 
2) If the patient experiences a severe IRR, then  patisiran administration will not be resumed 
until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor (see Section  6.4.3 ).   
• If the infusion time for a patient was already extended on the parent study due to an IRR, that 
modified infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular patient.  
Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discus sion with the 
Medical Monitor. 
• For the first 3 infusions of patisiran on this study, the patient’s infusion site should be assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the end of the infusion, and the patient will remain at the clinical site for 1 hour following 
completion of dosing. 
If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran  within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will 
be considered missed and not administered. 
Additional details  can be found in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual.  
In addition to study treatment, patients will receive  the recomme nded daily allowance of 
vitamin  A in an oral supplement.  Patients will receive this daily dose for the duration of their 
participation in the study while being administered patisiran . 
6.4.3. Suggested Guideli nes for Management of Infusion-R elated Reactions 
Criteria for categorizing IRRs are provided in  Appendix 3.  
• In the event of an IRR, the infusion of patisiran may be stopped and the patient closely 
monitored until resolution of the reaction.  Drugs that may be used to facilitate resolution and 
permit resumption of patisiran administration include, but are not limited to: paracetamol/acetaminophen (or equivalent), additional histam ine H1/H2 receptor antagonists 
(eg, ranitidine), NSAIDs, adrenaline, supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and/or corticosteroids. 
• Following resolution of a mild or moderate IRR that required interruption of the patisiran infusion, resumption of administration m ay occur at the Investigator’s discretion at a slower

patisiran.  If the infusion is delayed, the administration of the infusion should be completed 
no more than 6 hour s from the initial start of the infusion.   
• Patisiran administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe IRR until the 
case is discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
• If after consultation with the Medical Monitor it is agreed that an indivi dual patient’s  steroid 
premedication  will be increased then the following steps are recommended : 
1) If the IRR occurred while the patient received [ADDRESS_455165] 60 min utes before the infusion and/or 5 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent the night before the intravenous infusion.  
2) Increased dose of premedication steroids should NOT exceed the combination of 20 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent on the day of infusion and 8 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent taken the night before the infusion.  
3) If the IRR occurred while the patient received less than 10 mg intravenous 
dexamethasone or equivalent, then the patient should return to the prior dose of 
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent that did not result in an IRR.

visit.  A  subset of the efficacy assessments performed at 52 weeks will be performed annually 
thereafter.   The specific timing for each assessment is presented in  Table  1. 
For the 52- week time point, a central neurologic testing core facility will review the data derived 
from the various neuropathy measures at each participating site to ensure compliance with testing procedures and quality of the data.  A central echocardiography core lab will analyze the 
echocardiogram data.  A core lab will be responsible for processing and analyzing skin punch 
biopsy samples.   Magnetic resonance (MR) neurography data (when performed) will also be 
centrally read.  
Further details on performing the efficacy assessments will be provided in the Study Reference 
Manual.  
8.1.1. Neurological Testing  
Neurological testing will be performed and the results of these tests will be used to c alculate the

9.1.6. Ophthalmology Examination 
Ophthalmology examinations will include assessment of visual acuity, visual fields, and slit-
lamp evaluation.  Visual acuity should be evaluated at the beginning of each specified visit in the 
study (ie, prior to slit-lamp examination).  Manifest refraction will be performed at each specified visit before visual acuity testing and will be used to obtain a correction for visual acuity 
evaluations.  Visual acuity testing should be done with best (most recent) correction. 
Further details regarding the ophthalmology examinations will be provided in the Study 
Reference Manual.  
9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
9.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Disease progression (including worsening of neuropathy impairment) will not be considered an 
AE. 
All IRRs will be recorded as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious AE (S AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred; it does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
584
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 2.1 -Japan  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  43 • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192109] (eg, such events 
include allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions, or the development 
of drug dependency or abuse) 
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
Causal relationship assessment to drug treatm ents is required for purposes of reporting AEs.  To 
promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration along with good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the relationship of drug treatments to an 
AE: 
Definitely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible. 
Possibly Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Not Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative etiology. 
9.4. Recording Adverse Events 
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).  
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other findings. 
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below.  
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
daily activity.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and preven t usual activity.  
585
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)  ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455176] to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separat ely (with distinct onset dates).  
9.5. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported after the first dose of patisiran  regardless of their relationship to patisiran administration through the end of the 
study. 
Any medical condition that is present when the patient enters this extension study and does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it does deteriorate at any time during the study, it should be reported as an AE.  
All AEs m ust be fully recorded in the site’s source records and in the patients’ CRF, whether or 
not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE should be described in detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
Adverse events should be followed through the end of study visit or until recovery to the normal 
state has been achieved, whichever occurs first.  In the event of a patient not returning to the 
clinical unit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost to follow-up. 
For patients who withdraw from the study early, ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution 
or [ADDRESS_455177].  SAEs will be followed by [CONTACT_364529] . 
9.5.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE and laboratory abnormality that meets the above seriousness criteria (Section  [IP_ADDRESS])  must be 
reported immediately to the CRO, always within [ADDRESS_455178] the following information: 
•Patient’s study number
•Description and date of onset of the event
•Criterion for serious

13.1. Ethics Review  
National regulations and International Conference on Harmonization ( ICH) require that approval 
be obtained from an IRB or an IEC prior to participation of patients in research studies.  Prior to 
the study onset, the protocol, any protocol amendments, informed consent forms (ICFs), and any 
other written information regarding th is study to be provided to a patient or patient’s legal 
guardian must be approved by [CONTACT_4186]. 
All IRB and IEC approvals must be dated and contain IRB/IEC Chairman or designee 
authorization and must identify the IRB/IEC (eg, name [CONTACT_3816]), the cl inical protocol by [CONTACT_364561]/or protocol number, and the date of approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_324740].  
No drug will be released to the site to dose a patient until written IRB/IEC authorization has been 
received by [CONTACT_16015]. 
The Investigator is responsible for obtaining continuing review of the clinical research at least 
annually or more often if specified by [CONTACT_4186].  The Investigator must supply the Sponsor with written documentation of the approval of the continued clinical research.  
The Investigator will make all attempts to ensure that the IRB or IEC is constituted and operates in accordance with Federal and ICH GCP and any local regulations.  
13.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be performed in accordance with the clinical trial agreement, the protocol, all applicable government laws, regulations, and guidances where the study is being conducted including policies with foundations in the World Health Organization (WHO) Declaration of 
Helsinki, the ICH of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human 
Use, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and all other 
applicable medical privacy laws and regulations.  
13.2.1. Financial Disclosure Reporting Obligations 
Each Investigator (including Principal and any Sub Investigators) directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of study patients is required to provide financial disclosure information according to all applicable legal requirements.  In additio n, Investigators must commit to 
promptly updating this information if any relevant changes occur during the study and for a period of one year after the completion of the study. 
13.3. Written Informed Consent 
Written informed consent in compliance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 50 and ICH will be obtained from each patient before undergoing any protocol- specific tests or 
procedures that are not part of routine care.  
593
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455187] also be agreed upon.  The final IRB/IEC approved ICF must 
be provided to the Sponsor.  Revisions to the ICF required during the study must be agreed upon, 
and a copy of the revised ICF provided to the Sponsor. 
At the time of recruitment, each prospective patient (or legal guardian) will be given a full 
explanation of the study and be allowed to read the ICF.  Once the Investigator is assured that the 
patient/legal guardian understands the commitments of participating in the study, the patient/legal guardian will be asked to sign and date the ICF.  A copy of the fully signed and 
dated ICF will be given to the patient.  The original ICF will be maintained in the patient’s 
medical record at the site.  All active patients will sign an updated ICF if revisions are made to the ICF during the course of the study. 
Prior to dosing in this study, the patient will sign and date the ICF and receive a copy of the 
signed ICF.  No study procedures should be performed before informed consent is obtained.  The Investigator or another person authorized by [CONTACT_364538] a copy to the patient.  The ICF will be filed in the patient’s medical record.

14.1. Case Report Forms  
The Investigator and designees agree to maintain accurate CRFs and source documentation as 
part of these case histories.  Source documents are the originals of any documents used by [CONTACT_364539][INVESTIGATOR_307]/institution that allow verification of the existence of the patient and 
substantiate the in tegrity of the data collected during the trial. 
The Sponsor will supply CRFs for each patient.  Case report forms must be completed only by 
[CONTACT_192163].  Corrections must be made so as not to obliterate original 
data and must be identified and dated by [CONTACT_364541].  All data entered into the CRF must also be available in the source documents.  The Investigator will allow 
designated Sponsor representatives and regulatory bodies to have direct access to the source 
documents to verify the data reported in the CRFs. 
Each completed CRF must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_192164] a timely 
manner.  The completed CRF will be the records maintained by [CONTACT_1034].  A copy of the CRF 
will remain in the Investigator’s files.  
14.2. Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ anonymity will be maintained.  On the CRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_192172].  If patient names are included on copi[INVESTIGATOR_364492], the names (except for initials) will be 
obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintained by [CONTACT_144759]. 
Following the principles of the GCP, if local regulations specify a patient’s number and initials 
will be used to identify the patient on their study records.  Laboratory samples may be labeled 
with an independent numbering code, and the label will not contain any other personal 
identification information.  The numbering code associated with these labels will be held by [CONTACT_364543], thereby [CONTACT_192174].  The 
numbering code will also be held for samples in storage until marketing approval of patisiran in 
the countries where this study was conducted, or until clinical development of patisiran is halted.  Throughout sample collection, storage (limited, staff only access area containing locked sample 
storage, and limited access sample tracking) and processing, the samples will only be handled by 
[CONTACT_192175]’s standard operating procedures. 
The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compi[INVESTIGATOR_144668], whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor must approve 
any transfer of information not directly involved in the study.

Title of Study:  
A Multicenter, Open -Label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long- term Safety and Efficacy of 
Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Who Have Completed a Prior Clinical 
Study with Patisiran  
Study Centers:  
This study will be conducted at multiple sites worldwide that have enrolled patients in a previous patisiran study.  
Objectives : 
To assess the safety and efficacy of long -term dosing with patisiran in transthyretin -mediated 
amyloidosis ( ATTR ) patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy ( FAP). 
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, multinational, open-label extension study to evaluate the long- term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran  intravenously ( IV) 
once every 21  (±3) days for the duration of the study.  In order to maintain the every 21-day dosing 
schedule from the parent study , patients are expec ted to have their first visit (Day 0) in this study [ADDRESS_455200] every 30 (±5) days .  Patients will also have visits at the clin ical site 
at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_455201] these 
efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites [CAS]”); these sites can also dose and 
manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites [PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS for their [ADDRESS_455202] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be continually 
assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs) .  Unscheduled visits for study assessments may 
occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518].

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455207], dosage and mode of administration:  
Patisiran  (comprising a small interfering ribonucleic acid [ siRNA] targeting mutant and wild  type 
transthyretin [ TTR ] messenger RNA  [mRNA ], in a lipid nanoparticle formulation for IV 
administration) , 0.3 mg/kg once every 21 (±3) days administered as an IV infusion over 70 minutes 
(approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the 
remainder of the infusion) by a controlled infusion device. 
Patients will receive the following premedications at least 60 minutes before the  start of the patisiran  
infusion:  
• Intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg) or equivalent 
• Oral paracetamol/acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent 
• Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2 
blocker dose) 
• Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker 
available at the study site).  Hydroxyzine or fexofenadine 25 mg per os (PO, o rally) or 
cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient who does not tolerate IV diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker. 
Duration of treatment:  
The duration of the study has been determined to allow the collection of long- term safety, tolerabili ty 
and efficacy data of patisiran in patients with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  
The estimated duration of the study is 5 years.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  18 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
Transthyretin -mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant, systemic 
disease caused by a mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene leading to the extracellular 
deposition of amyloid fibrils containing both mutant and wild type (WT) TTR.1,2 The particular 
TTR mutation and site of amyloid deposition determines the clinical manifestations of the disease, which include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy.  AT TR is a progressive disease associated with severe morbidity, with a life 
expectancy limited to 5 to 15  years from symptom onset.
3 There are over 100 reported TTR 
mutations which are associated with 2 clinical syndromes: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy  
(FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC).4,5,[ADDRESS_455228] common causative mutation of FAP is TTR Val30Met 
(V30M), with the onset of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_192106] 30 and 55 years of age.9 
Reduction of circulating amyloidogenic TTR improves outcomes in patients with FAP.  Orthotopic liver transplantation, which eliminates mutant TTR fr om the circulation, has 
improved survival in early stage FAP patients .
10  The TTR tetramer stabilizer tafamidis 
(Vyndaqel®) was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of stage 1 FAP based on evidence that it may slow neuropathy progression in these patients, but has not been approved for use in other regions of the world.  Diflunisal, a generic, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that is also a tetramer stabilizer , exhibits slowing of neuropathy progression in FAP 
patients, but is not standardly used among practitioners.  Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for a potent and effective therapy for FAP that will have an impact on patients across a 
broad range of neurologic impairment, regardless of their mutation. 
1.2. Patisiran  
Patisira n (the International Nonproprietary Name [INN] name [CONTACT_364609] -TTR02) is a novel investigational agent being developed for the treatment of ATTR 
patients with symptomatic FAP .  Patisiran comprises a small interfering ribon ucleic acid 
(siRNA) which is specific for TTR, and is formulated in a hepatotropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
for intravenous (IV) administration.11 It is designed to significantly suppress liver production of 
both WT and all mutant forms of TTR, thereby [CONTACT_364552].  
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of patisiran were 
evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies that have enabled ch ronic dosing in clinical 
studies.  A summary of the nonclinical data can be found in the patisiran Investigators Brochure (IB).  
In a Phase 1 study of patisiran in healthy volunteers (Study ALN- TTR02 -001), patisiran was 
generally well tolerated .  Significant pharmacology in terms of TTR protein lowering (>80% 
reduction from pretreatment baseline) was observed at doses ≥0.15 mg/kg .  TTR levels showed 
evidence of recovery at Day 28 and return to baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 70.  A Phase 1 study in healthy 
624
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455229] s of Japanese origin (Study ALN- TTR02 -005) also showed dose dependent reduction in 
serum TTR, similar to that observed in Study ALN- TTR02 -001 in Caucasian subjects; patisiran 
was safe and well tolerated up to 0.3 mg/kg.  An open- label Phase 2 multiple ascending dose 
study of patisiran in ATTR patients with FAP (Study ALN -TTR02 -002) was conducted to 
determine the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a 60 or 70 minute IV 
infusion of patisiran administered once every 3 or 4 weeks for 2 dos es.  The top dose of 
0.3 mg/kg administered every 3 or 4 weeks was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, 
with maximum TTR knockdown of ~90% and sustained TTR suppression of >80% most 
consistently observed with every 3 week dosing.  Twenty seven of  the 29 patients treated on the 
Phase 2 trial enrolled in an open-label extension study (ALN- TTR02 -003) to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of long -term dosing with patisiran for approximately [ADDRESS_455230] been generally safe and well -tolerated on the -003 study, with preliminary data 
indicating no changes in liver function tests, renal function, or hematologic parameters, and no 
treatment -related discontinuations.  Sustained suppression of serum TTR of >80% has been 
observed in the open- label extension study, and preliminary clinical data at 6 months showed 
evidence for disease stabilization.12  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study of patisiran (ALN- TTR02 -004; APOLLO) is ongoing worldwide.  The main objectives of 
the study are to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of patisiran and to establish the safety of chronic dosing in ATTR patients with FAP.  Further details on the clinical studies of patisiran can be found in the patisiran IB. 
1.3. Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study designed  to evaluate the long -term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  
The nonclinical data and clinical experience with patisiran support the continuation of patisiran treatment in this long -term extension study for ATTR patients with FAP.  All patients will 
receive patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV every [ADDRESS_455231] completed a 
prior study with patisiran (provided they meet the eligibility criteria of this study), including those previously on placebo, to receive open- label patisiran.  P atients coming on to this open-
label study from a blinded study will remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment until at least database lock has occurred in that study.  The duration of the study has been determined 
to allow the collection of lo ng-term safety, tolerability and efficacy  data of patisiran in patients 
with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  The estimated duration of the study is [ADDRESS_455232] that lowering of the 
625
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455233] the clinical course of the disease.   Based on 
nonclinical and clinical data that showed suppression in levels of WT and mutant TTR upon 
administration of 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every [ADDRESS_455234] a clinical benefit in FAP patients with mild to moderate polyneuropathy and that 
further study is warranted.  
In completed and ongoing clinical studies (ALN- TTR02 -001, ALN- TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455235]-
TTR02 -003), single and multiple doses of patisiran have be en generally well tolerated.  Potential 
risks of patisiran include the following:  
• Infusion- Related Reactions  
Infusion- related reactions (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain biological 
agents such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the potential for an 
IRR with patisiran, all patients in this study will be premedicated p rior to dosing with 
patisiran .  The step -wise infusion regimen over approximately 70 minutes (starting with a 
slower infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes before increasing to 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion), may further reduce the risk of an IRR. 
• Liver function test abnormalities   
In preclinical studies, patisiran -related increased serum liver markers and histopathology in 
the liver w ere observed at dosages > 0.1 mg/kg in rats and > 1.0 mg/kg in monkeys.  In 
general, all of the findings were not observed or were observed at lower severity at the end of 
the 60-[ADDRESS_455236] been  no clinically significant  changes in  liver function tests  in 
either the single -dose or multiple -dose studies. Patients in the study are monitored for liver 
function via serial laboratory assessments.  
• Vitamin A Lowering  
The suppression of serum levels of TTR and RBP is expected to result in the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical and clinical data have shown that the lowering of 
circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does not result in severe vitamin A deficiency.  Furthermore, there are individuals with RBP/TTR mutations who have life- long 
low levels of circulating vitamin A and are essentially in good health, suggesting that there are compensatory transport mechanisms for vitamin A that are yet undescribed.
[ADDRESS_455237] started vitamin A supplementation by [CONTACT_364553]/her first dose of patisiran . 
• Osteoporosis 
Patients with FAP may be at risk for osteoporosis.[ADDRESS_455238] the potential to reduce bone

The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of long- term dosing with patisiran 
in ATTR patients with FAP.  
628
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455240] previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will e nroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran IV once 
every [ADDRESS_455241] a window of ± [ADDRESS_455242] visit (D ay 0) o n this study [ADDRESS_455243] 60 minutes before the start of the patisiran infusion .  Patisiran will be 
administered as a 70 -minu te IV infusion (approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 -minutes 
followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion).  If the infusion 
duration for a patient was lengthened beyond 70 minutes due to the occurrence of an IRR while on the parent study, that infusion duration may  be continued on this study for that particular 
patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site for patisiran dosing once every 
21 (±3) days, or receive the patisiran infusions at home by a healthcare professional trained on 
the protocol and delivery of premedication s and patisiran .  Patients who are receiving patisiran 
infusions at home will have a phone contact [CONTACT_364522] 30 (±5) days.  Patients 
will also have visits at the clinical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_455244] these efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites 
[CAS]”); these sites can dose and manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and 
manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites [PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS for their 52- week efficacy assessments .  Every effort should be made for the patient to return to 
the same CAS center that the patient went to in the parent study .  Yearly efficacy assessments 
after the 52 -week visit may be done at a PCS.  Prior to starting the study, the CAS and PCS will 
create a delegation of responsibilities document tha t clearly details which site is responsible for 
629
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455245] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be continually assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs) .  Unscheduled visits for study 
assessments ma y occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518].  
3.2. Number of Patients  
All patients who have previously completed a patisiran study may be enrolled if they meet the eligibility criteria for this study.  
3.3. Treatment Assignment  
All patients enrolled in this study will receive open -label patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV 
once every 21 (±3) days. 
The Investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_344354] (IRS) (via phone 
or web) after confirming that the  patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria .  The patient will then  be assigned a patient number that corresponds to their 
current patient number on the parent study.  A combination of the center number, parent study number, enrollment number, and patient initials will create the unique patient identifier.  In 
countries with regulations prohibiting the use of patient initials, a strategy consistent with local regulations will be used to generate replacement values for the patient initials.  
3.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study may be terminated if patisiran does not obtain marketing approval or the development of patisiran is no longer being pursued by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
any time.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all documentation and patisiran supplied for the study must be returned to the Sponsor  or its 
representative, and the Investigators, Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) / Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure 
appropriat e therapy and follow -up. 
630
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455246] meet the following criteria before administration of

Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without penalty to 
their continuing medical care.   For those patients who withdraw, every effort will be made to 
determine their reason for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248], and to complete the Early Withdrawal visit.  
The Investigator may withdraw a p atient from the study if the patient:  
•Is in violation of the protocol
•Experiences a serious or intolerable AE
•Becomes pregnant
•Requires a prohibited medication (see Section 5.2)
•Requests to be withdrawn from the study
•Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol-required patisiran dosing

The Investigator will withdraw patient s from the study upon the request of the Sponsor, 
including if the Sponsor terminates the study.  Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor before discontinuing the patient. 
Missing an occasional dose of patisiran  will not necessarily result in the patient being withdrawn 
from the study.  However, if a patient misses [ADDRESS_455251] and on the case report form (CRF).  
In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study, the clinical  research organization (CRO)

or fetal development despi[INVESTIGATOR_364488] (- 88% from baseline) in serum vitamin A in the dams 
dosed with the rat- specific TTR surrogate siRNA . 
In this study, women of child- bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, cannot be 
breastfeeding, and must be using [ADDRESS_455253] dose of patisiran in this study .  
Highly effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year).  
Acceptable forms of effective contraception are defined as follows:  
• Hormonal:  established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of conception 
• Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Placement of an intrauterine system (IUS)  
• Mechanical/barrier method of contraception:  condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault cap) in conjunction with spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or supposit ory) 
Note:  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not 
highly effective forms of contraception.  Therefore the use of additional spermicides 
does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  However, spermici des 
alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073] .  
Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be used alone. 
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasecto my 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient); 
• Sexual true abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Patients should be instructed to use [ADDRESS_455254] 
above.  Examples of 2 forms of highly effective contraception are as follows:  
• Oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• IUD in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide 
• Surgical sterilization of partner in conjunction with condom or diaphragm and spermicide  
Interaction between patisiran  and hormonal contraceptives is not anticipated.  The patisiran drug 
substance ALN -[ZIP_CODE] (siRNA), and the 2 novel lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 1,2- Dilinoleyloxy -N,N-

CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at any of the concentrations studied.  Th ese data suggest a low likelihood 
of patisiran  to interfere with the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives. 
Males (including men who have had vasectomies) with partners of child- bearing potential, must 
agree to use 1 barrier method (eg, condom) and 1 additional method (eg, spermicidal foam, gel, 
film, cream, or suppository) of contraception throughout study participation and for 75 days 
(ie, a whole spermatogenic cycle) after the last dose of patisiran in this study.  Males must also

5.2. Concomitant Medications  
Use of the following medications/treatments is prohibited during study participation: 
• Any investigational agent other than patisiran  
• Corticosteroids other than those administered as premedications prior to the dose of 
patisiran, those used to treat an infusion reaction, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_124374].  
However, for patients with chronic inflammatory disorders (eg, asthma, rheumatoid 
arthritis), systemically administered steroids may be permitted provided that: 1) the dose is <20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent if administered chronically, or 2) for 
doses ≥20 mg/day, administration is limited to no mor e than 5 consecutive days. 
Use of the medications/treatments listed below is permitted in patients who were already taking 
such medications while on the parent study in accordance with the rules of that study protocol.  
For patients who did not take these medications  while on the parent study, use of these 
medications is permitted, if necessary, only after the patient has completed the 52- week visit.  
• Tafamidis  
• Diflunisal 
• Doxycycline/TUDCA  
Medications and treatments other than those specified above, including palliative and supportive 
care approved by [CONTACT_364525]-related symptoms, are permitted during the study. 
All patients will be asked to continue to take an oral daily supplement containing the 
recommended daily allowance of vitamin A.  
Any concomitant medication or treatment that is required for the patient’s welfare may be given 
by [CONTACT_737].  Use of all concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded on the patient’s CRF through the end of the patient’s participation in the study.  This will include all prescription drugs, herbal preparations, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and 
minerals.  Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the CRF.

6.1. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and the preparation of patisiran will be in compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) specifications, as described in the Manu facture of Investigational 
Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_455256] is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 5.5 mL.  The container closure system consists of a [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia (USP/EP) Ty pe I borosilicate glass vial, a Teflon -faced butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium 
flip-off cap.  
6.2. Study Drug Storage  
Patisiran  will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5 ± 3oC.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions must be reported to the CRO and/or the Sponsor and use of the patisiran  halted until authorization for its continued use has been given by [CONTACT_95346].  
No special procedures for the safe handling of patisiran are required.  A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, 
and records.  
Patisiran  supplied for this study may not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. 
6.3. Study Drug Preparation  
Staff at each clinical  site or the healthcare professional administering patisiran  will be 
responsible for preparation of patisiran doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
All patients in this study will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days (± 3 days).  The 
amount (mg) of patisiran to be administered will be  based on the patient’s body weight (kg).  For 
each dose administered, the weight obtained during the previous dosing visit will be used to 
calculate the dose of patisiran .  In the event that  the weight obtained on the previous dosing day 
is not available, the weight obtained pre-dose on the current dosing day can be used for dose calculation.  Patients who weigh 105 kg or more will receive patisiran dosing based on an assumption of a body weight of 104 kg. 
Patisiran will be prepared under aseptic conditions.  The total amount to be infused into each 
patient at each dosing visit will be 200 mL.  Sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be added to a sterile infusion bag, and the calculated volume of patisiran  will be withdrawn from the vials and 
injected into the infusion bag. 
637
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455257] 60 minutes before the infusion: 
• Intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg) or equivalent 
• Oral paracetamol/acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent 
• Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2 
blocker dose) 
• Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker available at the clinical  site).  Hydroxyzine or fexofenadine 25 mg per os (PO, orally) 
or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient who does not tolerate IV diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker. 
Further details (including a table of equivalent premedications) can be found in the patisiran  
Pharmacy Manual.  
Patients will be started on the above premedication regimen.   However, modifications may be 
made to the premedication regimen after consultation with the medical monitor either due  to a 
patient’s inability to tolerate one or more of the premedications or to the occurrence of IRRs unresponsive to slowing of the infusion rate. 
• If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the steroid premedication regimen (e.g., patient 
develops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status , or other complication), then 
lowering of the steroid premedication may be allowed for that patient after consultation with the medical monitor.   
• If after consultation with the medical monitor, it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid premedication  will be lowered, then the following steps must be followed : 
1) If the current steroid dosage is 10 mg or less of  intravenous dexamethasone or 
equivalent, then the patient may be lowered in increments no greater than 2.5 mg intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent. 
2) After each incremental lowering of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, the patient 
must receive three consecutive intravenous doses of patisiran without IRR and continued 
signs or symptoms of steroid intolerance before further reductions in steroid 
premedications.   
3) The premedication steroid dosage should not be reduced below 5 mg intravenous 
dexamethasone or equivalent. 
Alternatively if a patient experie nces an IRR when 10 mg or less of IV dexamethasone or 
equivalent is used as the steroid premedication, then proceed to Section 6.4.3. 
If a patient’s  premedication regimen was modified prior to enrollment in Study TTR02 -006, the 
patient may continue on that modified premedication regimen.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  33 6.4.2. Study Drug Administration 
Patisiran will be administered under the supervision of the site personnel every 21 (±3) days.  
Patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_455258] patisiran administered at home , where 
applicable country and local regulations allow.  Home administration of patisiran will be done 
according to a site -specific plan  by a healthcare professional trained  on the protocol and delivery 
of premedications and patisiran. 
On all dosing days, patisiran will be administered as a 70 -minute IV infusion (approxima tely 
1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3  mL/minute for the remain der 
of the infusion). 
• If the patient experiences an IRR the infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the 
event of a mild or moderate IRR. 
1) If the patient experiences a mild or moderate IRR that resolves by [CONTACT_364579].  
2) If the patient experiences a severe IRR, then  patisiran administration will not be resumed 
until the case is discussed with  the M edical Monitor (see Section  6.4.3).   
• If the infusion time for a patient was already extended on the parent study due to an IRR, that 
modified infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discus sion with the 
Medical Monitor. 
• For the first 3 infusions of patisiran on this study, the patient’s infusion site should be assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the 
end of the infusion, and the patient will remain at the clinical site for 1 hour following 
completion of dos ing. 
If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran  within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will 
be considered missed and not administered. 
Additional details  can be found in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual.  
In addition to study treatment, patients w ill receive  the recomme nded daily allowance of 
vitamin  A in  an oral supplement. 
6.4.3. Suggested Guideli nes for Management of Infusion-R elated Reactions  
Criteria for categorizing IRRs are provided in Appendix 3.  
• In the event of an IRR, the infusion of patisiran may be stopped and the patient closely 
monitored until resolution of the reaction.  Drugs that may be used to facilitate resolution and

evaluations.  Visual acuity testing sho uld be done with best (most recent) correction. 
Further details regarding the ophthalmology examinations will be provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
9.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Disease progression (including worsening of neuropathy impairment) will not be considered an 
AE. 
All IRRs will be recorded as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious AE (S AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death  from 
the event as it occurred; it does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity

Clinical Protocol   Versio n 2.1 -Taiwan  10 December 2015  
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  43 • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192109] (eg, such events include allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions, or the development 
of drug dependency or abuse) 
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
Causal relationship assessment to drug treatments is required for purposes of reporting AEs.  To 
promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration along with good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the relationship of drug treatments to an 
AE: 
Definitely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clini cally plausible.  
Possibly Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative etiology.  
9.4. Recording Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC). 
In ad dition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other findings. 
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below.  
Mild:  Mild events are tho se which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
daily activity.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity . 
649
Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)  ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455270] to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of 
an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes 
should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
9.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported after the first 
dose of patisiran  regardless of their relationship to patisiran administration through the end of the 
study. 
Any medical condition that is present when the patient enters this extension study and does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it does deteriorate at any time during the study, it should be reported as an AE. 
All AEs must be fully re corded in the site’s source records and in the patients’ CRF, whether or 
not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE should be described in detail: onset time 
and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
Adverse events should be followed through the end of study visit or until recovery to the normal 
state has been achieved, whichever occurs first.  In the event of a patient not returning to the 
clinical unit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost to follow-up. 
For patients who withdraw from the study early, ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution 
or [ADDRESS_455271].  SAEs will be fo llowed by [CONTACT_364529]. 
9.5.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE and 
laboratory abnorma lity that meets the above seriousness criteria (Section  [IP_ADDRESS])  must be 
reported immediately to the CRO, always within [ADDRESS_455272] the following information:

will remain in the Investigator’s files.  
14.2. Confidentiality  
The Investigator m ust ensure that the patients’ anonymity will be maintained.  On the CRFs or 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_111242], but by [CONTACT_192172].  If patient names are included on copi[INVESTIGATOR_364492], the names (except for initials) will be 
obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintaine d by [CONTACT_144759]. 
Following the principles of the GCP, if local regulations specify a patient’s number and initials 
will be used to identify the patient on their study records.  Laboratory samples may be labeled 
with an independent numbering code, and the label will not contain any other personal 
identification information.  The numbering code associated with these labels will be held by [CONTACT_364563], thereby [CONTACT_192174].  The 
numbering code will also be held for samples in storage until marketing approval of patisiran in 
the countries where this study was conducted, or until clinical development of patisiran is halted.  Throughout sample collection, storage (limited, staff only access area containing locked sample 
storage, and limited access sample tracking) and processing, the samples will only be handled by 
[CONTACT_192175]’s standard operating procedures. 
The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compi[INVESTIGATOR_144668], whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor must approve 
any transfer of information not directly involved in the study.

A M
ulticenter, Open-label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety and 
Efficacy of Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy who have 
Completed a Prior Clinical Study with Patisiran 
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment 
The primary purpose of this amendment is to add the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-
SSRS) to the study assessments, which was inadvertently left out of previous versions of the 
protocol. The inclusion of the C-SSRS addresses a regulatory requirement to prospectively 
assess suicidality in clinical trials involving all drugs for neurological indications.  Overall, this 
amendment includes the following changes: 
 The  Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale has been added as an assessment of suicidal 
idea
tion and behavior. 
 C ountry-specific versions of the protocol have been integrated in order to increase 
consistency in the execution of the clinical study globally 
 Electroretinograms are now recommended to be performed in the case of suspected 
retinal disease. 
 The  premedication regimen has been updated to align with commercially available doses. 
 B lood samples for long-term storage have been added in order to permit future 
exploratory investigations. 
 Dur ing scheduled phone contact, clinical sites may now ask patients who are receiving 
home infusions about their general experience receiving these infusions 
A de
tailed summary of the above changes, in addition to changes made for clarity, is provided in 
Table 1.  Corrections to abbreviations, typographical errors and formatting are not detailed.

Patisiran  
Title of Study:  
A Multicenter, Open -Label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long- term Safety and Efficacy of 
Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Who Have Completed a Prior Clinical 
Study with Patisiran  
Study Centers:  
This study will be conducted at multiple sites worldwide that have enrolled patients in a previous patisiran study.  
Objectives : 
To assess the safety and efficacy of long -term dosing with patisiran in transthyretin -mediated 
amyloidosis ( ATTR ) patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy ( FAP). 
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, multinational, open-label extension study to evaluate the long- term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have previously completed a patisiran study. 
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran  intravenously ( IV) 
once every 21  (±3) days for the duration of the study.  In order to maintain the every 21-day dosing 
schedule from the parent study , patients are expec ted to have their first visit (Day 0) in this study [ADDRESS_455304] every 30 
(±5) days .  Patients will also have visits at the clin ical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_455305] these 
efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites [CAS]”); these sites can also dose and 
manage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites 
[PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS for the ir 52-week efficacy assessments.  E very 
effort should be made for the patient to return to the same CAS center that the patient went to in the parent study.  Yearly efficacy assessments after the [ADDRESS_455306] year and yearly thereafter.  Patients will be continually 
assessed throughout the study for adverse events  (AEs) .  Unscheduled visi ts for study assessments may

n. Grip strength will be measured in triplicate using a dynamometer held in the dominant hand.  Every effort will be made to use  the same device for a patient 
throughout the duration of the study.  Two assessments of the grip strength will be performed on separate days (1 assessment on each day).  The second 
(repeat) assessment must be conducted at least 24 hours (approximately) after the first assessment, but not more than [ADDRESS_455321] be completed without assistance from another person; ambulatory aids such as canes and walkers are permitted.  The time required for the patient to walk [ADDRESS_455322] will be performed 
on separate days (1 assessment on each day).  The second (repeat) assessment must be conducted at least 24 hours (approximate ly) but not more th an [ADDRESS_455323] assessment.  
q. Examination will include visual acuity, visual fields, and slit -lamp evaluation.  An electroretinogram may also be performed, as described in Section  9.1.6   
r. Optional skin biopsies will only be obtained if the patient had skin biopsies in the parent study and has provided separate i nformed consent for the skin 
biopsies in this study.  Each skin biopsy assessment will include 2 sets of tandem 3 -mm skin punch biopsies (4 biopsies total), including 1 set of biopsies 
taken from the distal lower leg, when a patient’s clinical status allows, and [ADDRESS_455324] 3 months.  
t. Patients who are entering this study from a protocol that does not include the Norfolk QOL -DN questionnaire (eg, ALN -TTR02 -003) do not have to 
complete this assessment.  
u. Patients entering this study from study ALN -TTR02 -003, who were not previously participating in the cardiac subgroup, will be required to have an 
echocardiogram before dosing on Day 0.  
v. Serum samples for anti -drug antibodies will be collected as specified.  
w. Patisiran will be administered once every 21 (±3) days.  Every effort should be made to continue dosing from the parent study  in the 21 (±3) day timeframe.  
Doses may be administered at the clinical site or, where  applicable country and local regulations allow,  at home by a healthcare professional trained in the 
protocol.  
x. Patients who are receiving patisiran infusions at home must be contact[CONTACT_364520] a minimum of every 30 (±5) days  for assessment of a dverse 
events and concomitant medication use.  During phone contact, patients may also be asked additional questions about their general experience receiving

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
Transthyretin -mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant, systemic 
disease caused by a mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene leading to the extracellular 
deposition of amyloid fibrils containing both mutant and wild type (WT) TTR.1,2 The particular 
TTR mutation and site of amyloid deposition determines the clinical manifestations of the disease, which include sensory and motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy.  ATTR is a progressive disease associated with sever e morbidity, with a life 
expectancy limited to 5 to 15  years from symptom onset.
3 There are over 100 reported TTR 
mutations which are associated with 2 clinical syndromes: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (F AC).
4,5,[ADDRESS_455331] common causative mutation of FAP is TTR Val30Met 
(V30M), with the onset of symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_192106] 30 and 55 years of age.9 
Reduction of circulating amyloidogenic TTR improves outcomes in patients with FAP.  Orthotopic liver transplantation, which eliminates mutant TTR from the circulation, has improved survival in earl y stage FAP patients .
10  The TTR tetramer stabilizer tafamidis 
(Vyndaqel®) was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of stage 1 FAP based on evidence that it may slow neuropathy progression in these patients, but has not been approved for us e in other regions of the world.  Diflunisal, a generic, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that is also a tetramer stabilizer , exhibits slowing of neuropathy progression in FAP 
patients, but is not standardly used among practitioners.  Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for a potent and effective therapy for FAP that will have an impact on patients across a 
broad range of neurologic impairment, regardless of their mutation. 
1.2. Patisiran  
Patisiran (the International Nonproprietary Name [INN] name [CONTACT_364609] -TTR02) is a novel investigational agent being developed for the treatment of ATTR 
patients with symptomatic FAP .  Patisiran comprises a small interfering ribonucleic acid 
(siRNA) which is specific for TTR, an d is formulated in a hepatotropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
for intravenous (IV) administration.11 It is designed to significantly suppress liver production of 
both WT and all mutant forms of TTR, thereby [CONTACT_364552].  
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of patisiran were 
evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies that have enabled chronic dosing in clinical 
studies.  A summary of the nonclinical data can be found in the patisiran Investigators Brochure 
(IB).  
In a Phase 1 study of patisiran in healthy volunteers (Study ALN- TTR02 -001), patisiran was 
generally well tolerated .  Significant pharmacology in terms of TTR protein lowering ( >80% 
reduction from pretreatment baseline) was observed at doses ≥0.15 mg/kg .  TTR levels showed 
evidence of recovery at Day 28 and return to baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 70.  A Phase 1 study in healthy

subjects of Japanese origin (Study ALN- TTR02 -005) also showed dose dependent reduction in 
serum TTR, similar to that observed in Study ALN- TTR02 -001 in Caucasian subjects; patisiran 
was safe and well tolerated up to 0.3 mg/kg.  An open- label Phase 2 multiple ascending dose 
study of patisiran  in ATTR patients with FAP (Study ALN -TTR02 -002) was conducted to 
determine the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a 60 or 70 minute IV 
infusion of patisiran administered once every 3 or 4 weeks for 2 doses.  The top dose of 
0.3 mg/k g administered every 3 or 4 weeks was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, 
with maximum TTR knockdown of ~90% and sustained TTR suppression of >80% most 
consistently observed with every 3 week dosing.  Twenty seven of the 29 patients treated on t he 
Phase 2 trial enrolled in an open-label extension study (ALN- TTR02 -003) to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of long -term dosing with patisiran for approximately [ADDRESS_455332] been generally safe and well -tolerated on the -003 study, with preliminary data 
indicating no changes in liver function tests, renal function, or hematologic parameters, and no 
treatment -related discontinuations.  Sustained suppression of serum TTR of >80% has been 
observed in the open- label extension st udy, and preliminary clinical data at 6 months showed 
evidence for disease stabilization.12  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study of patisiran (ALN- TTR02 -004; APOLLO) is ongoing worldwide.  The main objectives of 
the study are to dem onstrate the clinical efficacy of patisiran and to establish the safety of 
chronic dosing in ATTR patients with FAP.  Further details on the clinical studies of patisiran can be found in the patisiran Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3. Study Design Rationale  
This is  a multicenter, open-label extension study designed  to evaluate the long -term safety and 
efficacy of patisiran in patients with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  
The nonclinical data and clinical experience with patisiran support the continuation of patisiran treatment in this long -term extension study for ATTR patients with FAP.  All patients will 
receive patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV every [ADDRESS_455333] completed a prior study with patisiran (provided they meet the eligibility criteria of this study), including those previously on placebo, to receive open- label patisiran.  Patients coming on to this open-
label study from a blinded study will remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment until at least database lock has occurred in that study.  The duration of the study has been determined 
to allow the collection of long- term safety, tolerability and efficacy  data of patisiran in patients 
with FAP who have completed a prior study with patisiran.  The estimated duration of the study is [ADDRESS_455334] that lowering of the

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455335] the clinical course of the disease.   Based on 
nonclinical and clinical data that showed suppression in levels of WT and mutant TTR upon 
administration of 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every [ADDRESS_455336] a clinical benefit in FAP patients with mild to moderate polyneuropathy and that further study is warranted.  
In completed and ongoing clinical studies (ALN- TTR02 -001, ALN- TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455337]-
TTR02 -003), single and multiple doses of patisiran have been generally well tolerated.  Potential 
risks of patisiran include the following:  
• Infusion- Related Reactions  
Infusion- related reactions (IRRs) can occur with systemic administration of certain biological 
agents such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  In order to reduce the potential for an 
IRR with patisiran, all patients in this study will be premedicated p rior to dosing with 
patisiran .  The step -wise infusion regimen over approximately 70 minutes (starting with a 
slower infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes before increasing to 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion), may further reduce the risk of an IRR. 
• Liver function test abnormalities   
In preclinical studies, patisiran -related increased serum liver markers and histopathology in 
the liver w ere observed at dosages > 0.1 mg/kg in rats and > 1.0 mg/kg in monkeys.  In 
general, all of the findings were not observed or were observed at lower severity at the end of 
the 60-[ADDRESS_455338] been  no clinically significant  changes in  liver function tests  in 
either the single -dose or multiple -dose studies. Patients in the study are monitored for liver 
function via serial laboratory assessments.  
• Vitamin A Lowering  
The suppression of serum levels of TTR and retinol binding protein ( RBP ) is expected to 
result in the lowering of circulating vitamin A levels.  Preclinical and clinical data have 
shown that the lowering of circulating vitamin A associated with suppression of RBP does not result in severe vitamin A deficiency.  Furthermore, the re are individuals with RBP/TTR 
mutations who have life-long low levels of circulating vitamin A and are essentially in good health, suggesting that there are compensatory transport mechanisms for vitamin A that are yet undescribed.

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term dosing with pati siran 
in ATTR patients with FAP.

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455342] completed “parent” study ALN -TTR02 -[ADDRESS_455343] -TTR02 -003 is not being conducted in Japan.  
Consented eligible patients will enroll in this study and receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran  IV once 
every [ADDRESS_455344] a window of ± [ADDRESS_455345] visit (D ay 0) o n this study [ADDRESS_455346] 60 minutes before the start of the patis iran infusion.  Patisiran will be 
administered as a 70 -minu te IV infusion (approximately 1 mL/minute for the first 15 -minutes 
followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3 mL/minute for the remainder of the infusion).  If the infusion 
duration for a patient was lengthened beyond 70 minutes due to the occurrence of an IRR while 
on the parent study, that infusion duration may  be continued on this study for that particular 
patient.  Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discussion with the 
Medical Monitor. 
After the Day 0 visit, patients should return to the clinical site for patisiran dosing once every 
21 (±3) days .  Where applicable country and local regulations allow,   patients may receive the 
patisiran infusions at home by a healthcare professional trained on the protocol and delivery of 
premed ication s and patisiran .  Patients who are receiving patisiran infusions at home will have a 
phone contact [CONTACT_364522] 30 (±5) days.  Patients will also have visits at the 
clinical site at approximately 12, [ADDRESS_455347] these efficacy assessments (referred to as “Central Assessment Sites 
[CAS]”); these sites can dose and m anage patients.  There will also be sites that can dose and 
manage the patients (“Patient Care Sites [PCS])”, while sending the patients to the nearest CAS for their 52- week efficacy assessments .  Every effort should be made for the patient to return to 
the same CAS center that the patient went to in the parent study .  Yearly efficacy assessments

continually assessed throughout the study for adverse events (AEs) .  Unscheduled visits for study 
assessments may occu r if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_44518]. 
3.2. Number of Patients  
All patients who have previously completed a patisiran study may be enrolled if they meet the 
eligibility criteria for this study.  
3.3. Treatment Assignment  
All patients enrolled in this study will receive open -label patisiran at 0.3 mg/kg administered IV 
once every 21 (±3) days. 
The Investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_344354] (IRS) (via phone 
or web) after confirming that the  patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria .  The patient will then  be assigned a patient number that corresponds to their 
current patient number on the parent study.  A combination of the center number, parent study number, enrollment number, and patient initials will create the unique patient identifier.  In 
countries with regulations prohibiting the use of patient initials, a strategy consistent with local 
regulations will be used to generate replacement values for the patient initials.  
3.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study may be terminated if patisiran does not obtain marketing approval or the development 
of patisiran is no longer being pursued by [CONTACT_1034] (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc) . 
The Sponsor reserves the  right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
any time.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all documentation and patisiran supplied for the study must be returned to the Sponsor  or Medpac e, 
and the Investigators, Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) / Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the 
decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure appropriate therapy and follow-up.

4.3. Patient Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without penal ty to 
their continuing medical care.   For those patients who withdraw, every effort will be made to 
determine their reason for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248], and to complete the Early Withdrawal visit.  
The Investigator may withdraw a patient from the study if the patient:  
• Is in violation of the protocol 
• Experiences a serious or intolerable AE  
• Becomes pregnant  
• Requires a prohibited medication (see Section 5.2) 
• Requests  to be withdrawn from the study 
• Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol-required patisiran dosing 
visits  
The Investigator will withdraw patient s from the study upon the request of the Sponsor, 
including if the Sponsor terminates the study.  Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor before discontinuing the patient. 
Missing an occasional dose of patisiran  will not necessarily result in the patient being withdrawn 
from the study.  However, if a patient misses [ADDRESS_455354] and on the case report form (CRF).  
In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study, the clinical  research organization (CRO)

4.4. Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Restrictions / Contraception 
Requirements  
TTR transports vitamin A in plasma; therefore , reductions in circulating vitamin A levels

both male and female reproductive performance and embryo/fetal development .[ADDRESS_455355] been conducted in the rat 
and non-human primate ( NHP ) toxicology studies including a chronic NHP study in sexually 
mature animals, where there were no adverse effects in males (including sperm analyses and 
spermatogenic staging) or females.   In a dose range- finding rat embryo/fetal development study

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 3.1 -[LOCATION_008] 11 May 2017  
 
conducted with patisiran, there were no effects on mating, fertility, ovarian or uterine parameters, 
or fetal development despi[INVESTIGATOR_364488] (- 88% from baseline) in serum vitamin A in the dams 
dosed with the rat- specific TTR surrogate siRNA . 
Women of child- bearing potential  are defined as any woman or adolescent who has begun 
menstruation. A post-menopausal woman is defined as a woman who has 12 months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels 
>40 mIU/mL or [ADDRESS_455356] dose of patisiran in this study .  
Highly effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year).  
Acceptable forms of effective contraception are defined as follows:  
• Hormonal:  established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of conception 
• Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Placement of an intrauterine system (IUS)  
• Mechanical/barrier method of contraception:  condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault cap) in conjunction with spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or 
suppository) 
Note:  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not 
highly effective forms of contraception.  Therefore the use of additional spermicides 
does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  However, spermicides alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073] .  
Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be used alone. 
• Surgical st erilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy

components displayed an inhibitory effect on any of the CYPs investigated (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5).  In addition, there was no induction of CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 at any of the concentrations studied.  These data suggest a low likelihood 
of patisiran  to interfere with the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives. 
Males (including men who have had vasectomies) with partners of child -bearing potential, must

However, for patients with chronic inflammatory disorders (eg, asthma, rheumatoid 
arthritis), systemically administered steroids ma y be permitted provided that: 1) the 
dose is <20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent if administered chronically, or 2) for 
doses ≥20 mg/day, administration is limited to no more than 5 consecutive days.  
Use of the medications/treatments listed below is permitted in patients who were already taking 
such medications while on the parent study in accordance with the rules of that study protocol.  
For patients who did not take these medications  while on the parent study, use of these 
medications is permitted, if ne cessary, only after the patient has completed the 52- week visit.  
• Tafamidis  
• Diflunisal 
• Doxycycline/TUDCA  
Medications and treatments other than those specified above, including palliative and supportive 
care approved by [CONTACT_364525]- related s ymptoms, are permitted during the study. 
All patients will be asked to continue to take the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. Patients will receive this daily dose for the duration of their participation in the study while being administered patisiran. In Japan, the clinical sites will provide patients  with a prescription for 
vitamin A . 
Any concomitant medication or treatment that is required for the patient’s welfare may be given by [CONTACT_737].  Use of all concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded on the 
patient’s CRF through the end of the patient’s participation in the study.  This will include all

6. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
6.1. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and the prepa ration of patisiran will be in compliance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) specifications, as described in the Manufacture of Investigational 
Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_455360] is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 5.5 mL.  The container closure system consists of a [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia (USP/EP) Type I borosilicate glass vial, a Teflon -faced butyl rubber stopper, and an aluminium 
flip-off cap.  
6.2. Study Drug Storage  
Patisiran  will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5 ± 3oC.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions must be reported to the CRO and/or the Sponsor and use of the patisiran  halted until authorization for its continued use has been give n by [CONTACT_95346].  
No special procedures for the safe handling of patisiran are required.  A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, 
and records.  
Patisiran  supplied for this study may not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. 
6.3. Study Drug Preparation  
Staff at each clinical  site or the healthcare professional administering patisiran  will be 
responsible for preparation of patisiran doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
All patients in this study will receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran once every 21 days (± 3 days).  The 
amount (mg) of patisiran to be administered will be  based on the patient’s body weight (kg).  For 
each dose admini stered, the weight obtained during the previous dosing visit will be used to 
calculate the dose of patisiran .  In the event that the weight obtained on the previous dosing day 
is not available, the weight obtained pre-dose on the current dosing day can be used for dose 
calculation.  Patients who weigh 105 kg or more will receive patisiran dosing based on an assumption of a body weight of 104 kg. 
Patisiran will be prepared under aseptic conditions.  The total amount to be infused into each 
patient at each dosing visit will be 200 mL.  Sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be added to a sterile infusion bag, and the calculated volume of patisiran  will be withdrawn from the vials and 
injected into the infusion bag.

•Intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg) or equivalent
•Oral paracetamol/acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent
•Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2
blocker dose)
•Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blockeravailable at the clinical  site).  Hydroxyzine 25 mg per os (PO, orally) or fexofenadine
30 mg or 60 mg PO or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be substituted for any patient whodoes not tolerate IV diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker.
Further details (including a table of eq uivalent premedications) can be found in the patisiran  
Pharmacy Manual.  
Patients will be started on the above premedication regimen.   However, modifications may be 
made to the premedication regimen after consultation with  the medical monitor either due  to a 
patient’s inability to tolerate one or more of the premedications or to the occurrence of IRRs unresponsive to slowing of the infusion rate. 
•If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the steroid premedication regimen (e.g., patient
develops uncontroll ed hyperglycemia, altered mental status , or other complication), then
lowering of the steroid premedication may be allowed for that patient after consultation withthe medical monitor.
•If after consultation with the medical monitor, it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroidpremedication  will be lowered, then the following steps must be followed :
1) If the current steroid dosage is 10 mg or less of  intravenous dexamethasone or
equivalent, then the patient may be lowered in increments no greater than 2.5 mgintravenous dexamethasone or equivalent.
2) After each incremental lowering of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent, the patient
must receive three consecutive intravenous doses of patisiran without IRR and continued
signs or symptoms of steroid int olerance before further reductions in steroid
premedications.
3) The premedication steroid dosage should not be reduced below 5 mg intravenous
dexamethasone or equivalent.
Alternatively if a patient experiences an IRR when  10 mg or less of IV dexamethasone or 
equivalent is used as the steroid premedication, then proceed to Section 6.4.3. 
If a patient’s premedicatio
n regimen was modifie d prior to enrollment in Study TTR02-006, the 
patient may continue on that modified premedication regimen.

6.4.2. Study Drug Administration 
Patisiran will be administered under the supervision of the site personnel every 21 (±3) days.  
Patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_455362] patisiran administered at home , where 
applicable country and local regulations allow.  Home administration of patisira n will be done by 
a healthcare professional trained  on the protocol and delivery of premedications and patisiran. 
On all dosing days, patisiran will be administered as a 70 -minute IV infusion (approximately 
1 mL/minute for the first 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_3450] 3  mL/minute for the remain der 
of the infusion). 
•If the patient experiences an IRR the infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the
event of a mild or moderate IRR.
1) If the patient experiences a mild or moderate IRR that resolves by [CONTACT_364527].
2) If the patient experiences a severe IRR, then patisiran administration will not be resumed  
until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor (see Section 6.4.3).
•If the infusion time for
 a patient was already extended on the parent study due to an IRR, that
modified infusion duration may be continued on this study for that particular patient.
Returning the patient’s infusion duration to 70 minutes will require a discus sion with the
Medical Monitor.
•For the first 3 infusions of patisiran on this study, the patient’s infusion site should be
assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the
end of the infusion, and the patient will remain at the clinical site for 1 hour followingcompletion of dosing.
If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran  within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will 
be considered missed and not administered. 
Additional details  can be found in the patisiran Pharmacy Manual.  
In addition to study treatment, patients will receive  the recomme nded daily allowance of 
vitamin  A .  Patients will receive this daily dose for the duration of their participation in the 
study while being administered patisiran.  In Japan the clinical sites will provide the subjects 
with a prescription for vitamin A.
. 
6.4.3. Suggested Guideli nes for Management of Infusion-R elated Reactions  
Criteria for categorizing IRRs are provided in Appendix 3. 
•In the event of an IRR, the infusion of patisiran may be stopped and the patient closely
monitored until resolution of the reaction.  Drugs that may be used to facilitate resolution andpermit resumption of pati siran administration include, but are not limited to:
paracetamol/acetaminophen (or equivalent), additional histamine H1/H2 receptor antagonists
(eg, ranitidine), NSAIDs, adrenaline, supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and/or corticosteroids.
•Following resolut ion of a mild or moderate IRR that required interruption of the patisiran
infusion, resumption of administration may occur at the Investigator’s discretion at a slower

infusion rate (but not to exceed 3 hours) for that dose and for all subsequent doses of 
patisiran.  If the infusion is delayed, the administration of the infusion should be completed 
no more than 6 hours from the initial start of the infusion.   
• Patisiran administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe IRR until the case is discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
• If after consultation with the M edical M onitor it is agreed that an individual patient’s  steroid 
premedication  will be increased then the following steps are recommended : 
1) If the IRR occurred while the patient receiv ed [ADDRESS_455363] 60 minutes before the infusion and/or 5 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent the night before the intravenous infusion.  
2) Increased dose of premedication steroids should NOT exceed the combination of 20 mg 
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent on the day of infusion and 8 mg oral 
dexamethasone or equivalent taken the night before the infusion.  
3) If the IRR occurred while the patient received less than 10 mg intravenous 
dexamethasone or equivalent, then the patient should return to the prior dose of 
intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent that did not result in an IRR. 
Patients will be instructed to call the Investigator if they experience symptoms such as fever, 
chills, myalgia, or nausea/vomiting after discharge from the site.  
6.5. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator or designee (or in Japan, the responsible pharmacist designated according to the 
Japan local regulations) will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the patisiran  supplied for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will be 
kept of the weight used to calculate each dispensed patisiran dose, and when and how much 
patisiran  is dispensed and used by [CONTACT_231759].  Any reasons for departure from the 
protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded.

9.1.6. Ophthalmology Examination 
Ophthalmology examinations will include assessment o f visual acuity, visual fields, and slit-
lamp evaluation.  Visual acuity should be evaluated at the beginning of each specified visit in the 
study (ie, prior to slit- lamp examination).  Manifest refraction will be performed at each 
specified visit before v isual acuity testing and will be used to obtain a correction for visual acuity 
evaluations.  Visual acuity testing should be done with best (most recent) correction. 
An electroretinogram (ERG) is a test to evaluate the retinal response to light.   It is done to 
determine if there is da mage to rods and cones.  ERG testing should be performed if visual 
changes raise the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_364491].  
Further details regarding the ophthalmology examinations will be provided in the Study 
Reference Manual.  
9.1.7. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) will be used to assess each patient's 
mental status as it relates to suicidal ideation and behavior.   If a patient’s C -SSRS raises concern 
of suicidal ideation or behavior, the Investigator must ensure prompt and appropriate mental 
health interventions in accordance with standard of care. 
9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
9.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Disease progression (including worsening of neuropathy impairment) will not be considered an 
AE. 
All IRRs will be recorded as AEs.

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 3.1 -[LOCATION_008] 11 May 2017  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious AE (S AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate r isk of death from 
the event as it occurred; it does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30506] (eg, such events 
include allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions, or the development 
of drug dependency or abuse) 
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
Causal relationship assessment to drug treatments is req uired for purposes of reporting AEs.  To 
promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration along with 
good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the relationship of drug treatments to an 
AE: 
Definitely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible.  
Possibly Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information 
on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, 
chemicals, or underlying d isease provide plausible explanations. 
Not Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative etiology.  
9.4. Recording Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked a bout medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).

Patisiran (ALN -TTR02)   ALN -TTR02 -006 
Clinical Protocol  Version 3.1 -[LOCATION_008] 11 May 2017  
 
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other findings. 
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below.  
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
daily activity.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual a ctivity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of 
an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day 
should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with  distinct onset dates).  
9.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported after the first 
dose of patisiran  regardless of their relationship to patisiran administration through the end of the 
study. 
Any medical condition that is present when the patient enters this extension study and does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it does deteriorate at any time during 
the study, it should be reported as an AE. 
All AEs must be fu lly recorded in the site’s source records and in the patients’ CRF, whether or 
not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE should be described in detail: onset time 
and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
Adverse events should be followed through the end of study visit or until recovery to the normal 
state has been achieved, whichever occurs first.  In the event of a patient not returning to the clinical unit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost to follow-up. 
For patients who withdraw from the study early, ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution 
or [ADDRESS_455375].  SAEs will be followed by [CONTACT_364529]. 
9.5.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the above seriousness criteria (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) must be reported immediately to the CRO, always within [ADDRESS_455376] the following information:

of the trial master file on study completion.  
9.5.2. Pregnancy Reporting  
A female patient must ha ve a negative pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_455381] dose of patisiran , the Investigator should report 
the pregnancy to the CRO within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the 
pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form.  Treatment with patisiran  will be 
discontinued in any patient who is found to be pregnant during the study.  The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnancy should be followed by [CONTACT_144723].  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), then the Investigator should follow the 
procedures for reporting an SAE outlined above. 
Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a patient participating in the study should also be reported 
to the Investigator, who will then report this to the CRO and follow to outcome as de scribed 
above.

14.1. Case Report Forms  
The Investigator and designees agree to maintain accurate CRFs and source documentation as 
part of these case histories.  Source documents are the originals of any documents used by [CONTACT_192162][INVESTIGATOR_307]/institution that allow verification of the existence of the patient and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected during the trial.  
The Sponsor will supply CRFs for each patient.  Case report forms must be completed only by 
[CONTACT_192163].  Corrections must be made so as not to obliterate original 
data and must be identified and dated by [CONTACT_364541].  All data entered 
into the CRF must also be available in the sourc e documents.  The Investigator will allow 
designated Sponsor representatives and regulatory bodies to have direct access to the source 
documents to verify the data reported in the CRFs. 
Each completed CRF must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_192164] a timely 
manner.  The completed CRF will be the records maintained by [CONTACT_1034].  A copy of the CRF 
will remain in the Investigator’s files.  
14.2. Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ anonymity will be maintained.  On the  CRFs or 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_111242], but by [CONTACT_192172].  If patient names are included on copi[INVESTIGATOR_364492], the names (except for initials) will be 
obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintained by [CONTACT_144759]. 
Following the principle s of the GCP, if local regulations specify a patient’s number and initials 
will be used to identify the patient on their study records.  Laboratory samples may be labeled 
with an independent numbering code, and the label will not contain any other personal 
identification information.  The numbering code associated with these labels will be held by [CONTACT_364563], thereby [CONTACT_192174].  The 
numbering code will also be held for samples in storage until marketing approval of patisiran in 
the countries where this study was conducted, or until clinical development of patisiran is halted.  Throughout sample collection, storage (limited, staff only access area containing locked sample 
storage, and limited access s ample tracking) and processing, the samples will only be handled by 
[CONTACT_192175]’s standard operating procedures. 
The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compi[INVESTIGATOR_144668], whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor must approve 
any transfer of information not directly involved in the study.

Appendix 3: Categorization of Infusion- Related Reactions  
 
Signs and symptoms of an infusion-related reaction (IRR) usually develop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  Signs/symptoms may include: allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever), arthralgia 
(joint pain), bronchospasm, cough, dizziness, dyspnea (shortness of breath), fatigue (asthenia, 
lethargy, malaise), headache, hypertension, hypotension, myalgia (muscle pain), nausea, pruritus/itching, rash/desquamation, rigors/chills, sweating (diaphore sis), tachycardia, urticaria 
(hives, welts, wheals), vomiting. 
Categorization of IRRs is as follows: 
 
Categorization Description  
Mild  Mild reaction:  infusion may be continued; if intervention is indicated 
it is minimal and additional treatment (other than paracetamol for delayed reactions) is not required. 
Moderate  Moderate reaction:  requires treatment including more intensive 
therapy (eg, IV fluids, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug 
[NSAIDs]) in addition to infusion interruption but responds promptly 
to medication.  Treatment is indicated for ≤24 hours. 
Severe  More than moderate reaction:  not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_192114]; and/ or prolonged (treatment is indicated for >24 hours); recurrence of severe symptoms fol lowing initial 
improvement.

Summary of Changes (dated 11 May  2017)  
compared to Protocol Version 3.0 (d ated 05 January 2017) 
A Multicenter, Open -label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long- Term Safety and 
Efficacy of Patisiran in Patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy who have 
Completed a Prior Clinical Study with Patisiran  
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment  
The purpose of this country-specific protocol amendment is to address comments (dated 
28 February 2017) from the [LOCATION_008]’s National Health Service Ethics Committee 
   Text  has been added to the 
protocol detailing that if a patient ’s Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) score 
raises concern of suicidal ideation or behavior, the Investigator must ensure prompt and appropriate mental health interventions in accordance with standard of care.  
A detailed summary of changes is provided in Table  1.

Table 1: Protocol Amendment 2 Detailed Summary of Changes  
The primary section(s) of the protocol affected by [CONTACT_364545].  The corresponding text has 
been revised throughout the protocol.  Deleted text is indicated by [CONTACT_364546]; added text is indicated by [CONTACT_364547]. 
Purpose: Added text that if a patient’s Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) score raises concern of suicidal ideation or behavior, the 
Investigator must ensure prompt and appropriate mental health interventions in accordance with standard of care  
The primary change occurs in Section 9.1.7, Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Added text:  The Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) will be used to assess each patient's mental status 
as it relates to suicidal ideation and behavior.  If a patient’s C -SSRS raises concern of suicidal ideation 
or behavior, the Investigator must ensure prompt and appropriate mental health interventions in 
accordance with standard of care.

1. Introduction  
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_860118].1,2 Ketamine can play a role in perioperative pain management 
by [CONTACT_860132][INVESTIGATOR_860119]-effects.3  
1.1 Ketamine  
Ketamine is a well -known general anesthetic functioning  by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -
receptor antagonism. Addition ally, ketamine has diverse molecular targets and neurophysiological 
properties  which can help in the management of acute and chronic pain, depression, posttraumatic 
stress disorders , and schizophrenia .4   
1.1.1 Role of ketamine for anesthesia and a nalgesia  
Ketamine can be used for induction of anesthesia, analgesia and for pr evention of inflammation 
and persistent pain. The drug’s  analgesic and anti-inflammatory  effects are particularly useful in 
perioperative pain management  because it reduces opi[INVESTIGATOR_860120] .[ADDRESS_1198805] is 
mediated through NMDA receptors6, voltage -gated sodium channels7,8, BK channels9, opi[INVESTIGATOR_264574] (mu , delta)10,11 and  gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors12 (Table  1). 
Unsurprisingly, analgesia requires lower concentrations than  general anesthesia .13,14 A range of 
systemic inflammatory response is set in motion by  [CONTACT_569817], eliciting complex interaction 
with numerous inflammatory bioma rkers.15 Ketamine anti -inflammatory potential is elucidated by 
[CONTACT_860133] -6 (IL -6) in early postoperative period.16 Ketamine also play 
an important role in depression management.17 
Ostensibly  ketamine should be used widely for improving postoperative pain and outcome s. 
However this is not the case. The psychologic side -effects are one of the main reasons for its 
limited use. Emergence reaction s are in reported in 10 -20% of the patients. Consequentially opi[INVESTIGATOR_860121].  
Ketamine may play role in reducing perioperative hypotension which  has been associated with 
increased perioperative morbidity and mortality.18,[ADDRESS_1198806] s including  psychedelic symptoms (hallucinations, memory defects, panic 
attacks), nausea/vomiting, somnolence, cardiovascular stimulation and, in a minority of patients, 
hepatoxicity . 24 Usually the dose used is 30 mg/hour for [ADDRESS_1198807] on the γ -aminobutyric ac id (GABA) system, and modulation of the 
serotonergic system have been suggested as possible mechanisms .27 Lamotrigine, an 
anticonvulsant which decreases presynaptic glutamate release  and widely used for 
neuropsychiatric illness .28 Lamotrigine augmentation of serotonin reuptake inhibitors is well 
tolerated in treatment -resistant obsessive –compulsive disorde r. 29 Lamotrigine  may pla y a role  in 
treating  ketamine use disorder.30 
A key study was reported at the Society of Neuroscience meeting in 1997 and later published in 
the Archives of General Psychiatry.  It reported that  in healthy subjects , 300 mg oral lamotrigine 
significantly decreased ketamine -induced perceptual abnormalities as assessed  by [CONTACT_138208] -
Administered Dissociative States Scale (P<.001) .31 Furthermore lamotrigine increased the 
immediate mood -elevating effects of ketamine (P<.05) . The authors concluded  that gl utamate 
release -inhibiting drugs may reduce the hyperglutamatergic consequences of NMDA receptor 
dysfunction which may be implicated in the pathophysiologic processes of neuropsychiatric 
illnesses .  
In an another experiment designed to identify the  sites of action of ketamine in inducing symptoms 
and to determine the role of increased glutamate release using the glutamate release inhibitor 
lamotrigine , the authors concluded that lamotrigine pretreatment prevented many of the signal 
changes and the s ymptoms  associated with ketamine use..  The results of this clinical study were 
confirmed in a laboratory  study published in Science 1998 –“Reversal  of Phencyclidine Effects by 
a Group II Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Agonist in Rats ”.32  The authors noted that “ Group  II 
metabotropic glutamate receptors were targeted to normalize glutamatergic disruptions 
associated with an anim al model of schizophrenia, the phencyclidine model. An agonist of this 
group of receptors, at a dose that was without effects on spontaneous activity and corticolimbic 
dopamine neurotransmission, attenuated the disruptive effects of phencyclidine on workin g 
memory, stereotypy, locomotion, and cortical glutamate efflux. This behavioral reversal occurred 
in spi[INVESTIGATOR_860122] .”  
Available  evidence  therefore  support s use of lamotrigine for reduc ing undesirable psychologic 
effects of low dose ketamine in perioperative period. If it in fact does, lamotrigine might broaden  
use of ketamine for anesthesia and pain management.

 2. Specific Aim and Hypothesis  
Aim – The aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_860123] d eterm ine whether lamotrigine reduce s psychologic side -
effects consequent to  low-dose ketamine in surgical patients.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_860124] a subsequent  hypothesis testing study , and provide data to strengthen a  sample -size 
estimate . 
Hypothesis  - Preoperative treatment with 300 mg lamotrigine reduce s psychologic side -effects 
(measured  by [CONTACT_860134] : conceptual disorganization, 
hallucinatory behavior, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_23703], and unusual thought content ) in adults given  ketamine for 
non-cardiac surgery .  
 
3. Significance  
Ketamine has multiple properties of an ideal anesthetic induction and maintenance agent. The 
analgesic effects has desirable opi[INVESTIGATOR_263067], and the anti-inflammatory  properties may 
help improve outcomes. But its use in perioperative setting is limited, primarily, due to concerns 
of the psychologic side effect. Lamotrigine can help reduce the undesirable psychologic side -
effects of ketamine.  
4. Plan of investigation  
4.1 Outcomes  
1.1.1 Primary outcome  
1. Psychologic side -effects measured  in PACU (up to 90 minutes after ketamine infusion) 
by [CONTACT_860134] ( BPRS ) corresponding  to positive  
symptoms of schizophrenia: conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_23703], and unusual thought content. Each symptom is rated 1 -7 (1 = not 
present, 2 = very mild, 3 = mild, 4 = moderate, 5 = moderately severe, 6 = severe, 7 = 
extremely  severe), and, therefore, the total score based on four  key items of BPRS will 
be between 4 (best score) and  28 (worst score).  
4.1.2 Secondary outcomes  
1. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_70995]  – total IV morphine equivalents  
2. Pain score in PACU  – numeric rating scale ( 0 -10)  
3. Binary outcome p ostoperative nausea vomiting (PONV)  in PACU  
4. Postoperative Nursing Progress Record (NPR) records nausea vomiting severity as: 
0=none, 1= mild, 2=moderate, 3= severe; analysis will compare two study groups on 
moderate and severe nausea / vomiting ( 0 or 1 vs. 2 or 3) in the PACU .  
4.1.3 Exploratory outcomes  
1. Sedation agitation scale33 (RASS score) at the time of admission in PACU.  
2. Average daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_860125] ( morphine equivalents) . 
5 
 3. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_727161] -effects , using the o pi[INVESTIGATOR_33048] (ORSDS)  
on the first and second postoperative  days.34,35  
 
4.2 Trial design  
Double blind, randomized (1:1) , pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] . 
4.[ADDRESS_1198808] with 95% confidence interval.     
Variability and treatment effect estimates observed in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_860126].    
Although not the focus, assuming standard deviation of 2 units (Anand and others, A ttention of 
the Neuropsychiatric effects of Ketamine with Lamotrigine reported the mean ± SD of 1.5± 2 for 
BPRS outcome), the sample size of N=25 patients per group (N=50 patients total) will provide 
about 90% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_1198809]  the difference of 1.9 or larger in units 
drop between two study groups.  
 
 5. Eligibility criteria  
Patient undergoing elective abdominal surgery.  Specifically, we wil l enroll surgical inpatients 
18-65 yr  having noncardiac surgery who require a general  anesthesia.  We will exclude patients 
in whom ICU admission is planned preoperatively.   
5.1 Inclusion criteria  
- 18-65 years of age  
- Planned  overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836] 
- Planned surgery duration 3-6 hours  
5.2 Exclusion criteria  
- Pediatric and pregnant patients  
- History of seizure  
- History of Schizophrenia  
- History of unstable angina  
- Antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_860127]  
- History of lamotrigine use 
6. Training for rating scales:  
 
a. BPRS rating s:  will be conducted by [CONTACT_860135].  All fellows will be trained on how to do the 
ratings by [CONTACT_3252] -investigator, [CONTACT_860141] (Vice -chair of Research, Center for Behavioral Health). Raters 
[ADDRESS_1198810] to pass a quiz used in a large ketamine study b eing conducted at the Cleveland Clinic  to 
assess understanding regarding the ratings .  
6. Protocol  
6.1 Patient recruitment  
From anesthesia preoperative clinic.  
6.2 Randomization and blinding  
1:1 randomization without stratification use web -based software (Redcap) before surgery. 
Allocation will be concealed from the patient, the nurse, the operating room team. Both patient 
and the operating room team will be blind ed to the treatment allocation (double blind).  
6.[ADDRESS_1198811] intraoperative care as per the anesthesia care team. All patients will receive Ketamine 1 
mg/kg at induction. Ketamine 5mcg/kg/min will be started at induction  and stopped at the end of 
surgery.   
6.[ADDRESS_1198812] postoperative care as per PACU team. The psychologic side -effects will be measured 
using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)37,38 using an online 
tool( http://farmaco logiaclinica.info/scales/BPRS/ ), within [ADDRESS_1198813] Anand has used this training for other current research projects.  
7. Data analysis  
The analysis and reporting of the results will fol low the CONSORT guidelines ( www.consort -
statement.org  ). The process of patient selection and flow throughout the study will be summarized 
using a flow -diagram.  
We will analyze patients in the treatment grou p to which they are allocated, according to the 
intention -to-treat principle. Any patients lost to follow -up will be censored at the t ime they are lost 
to follow -up.  
7.[ADDRESS_1198814], we compared two randomized groups ( lamotrigine vs. placebo ) for balance on potentially 
confounding patients’  demographic, baseline and surgical characteristics using univariable 
summary statistics (mean and standard deviation, median and quartiles, or proportions, as 
7 
 appropriate) and using absolute standardized difference scores (ASDs).  ASDs are defined as the 
absolute value of the difference between means, mean rankings, or proportions divided by a 
combined estimate of standard deviation; thus the ASD roughly represents the number of standard 
deviations the two  study groups are apart from one another.   
The exploratory outcomes will be summarized  by [CONTACT_860136]: expressed as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for 
continuous variables and number (percent) for categorical variables.  No formal statistical test 
will be conducted for the exploratory outcomes.  
Primary analysis  
As for primary analysis, two randomized groups will be compared on the continuous  total score 
based on BPRS four items ranging between 4 (best score) and 28 (worst score ). We will estimate 
the effect of Lamotrigine on reduction psychological side -effects of ketamine infusion using  the 
two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test and Hodges Lehmann estimation of location shift  (along with 
95% confidence interval) . This method is appropriate since  we expect that the outcome will exhibit 
a skewed distribution. If the inc idence of any psychologic effects  is very low, meaning that  vast 
majority of the patients will have a score of four (corresponding to no symptoms) , we will treat 
the outcome as binary (no symptoms vs. any symptoms). I this case the  chi-square test will be used 
to compare two randomized groups ; the odds ratio along with 95% confidence interval will be 
reported . 
The Type I error for the primary analysis will be kept at 5% level with significance criterion of 
P<0.05.  
Secondary analysis  
Assuming log -normal distribution of PACU opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]  (in IV morphine equivalent) , we 
will evaluate the percent difference in geo metric mean IV morphine equivalent dose between the 
two randomized groups using t-test on the log -transformed data . To evaluate the difference in 
mean PACU pain scores (in VRS scale) we will first summarize the pain scores (in VRS scale) by 
[CONTACT_860137] (TWA) pain score for each patient. Then we will use a 
t-test to assess the exposure effect on the TWA pain scores. Binary PONV outcome will be 
compared  between two study groups using chi -square test.  
We used the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple analyses to preserve Type I error at 5% level for 
the secondary analysis with the significance criterion of 0.017 for each of the secondary outcome 
(i.e., 0.05 / 3).  
7.2 Data management  
Redcap software will be used for storing patient level information for this study.  Or paper case 
report form will be used and stored in secure location at Outcomes Research department.

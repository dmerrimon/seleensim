1.1 Title  
A phase 1 open -label clinical trial to evaluate the safety  and immunogenicity of 
synthetic DNAs encoding a native -like HIV Env Trimer and Interleukin -12 (INO -
6160), alone or in a prime -boost regimen with 3M -052-AF + Alum adjuvanted 
VRC HIV Env Trimer 4571  in adult participants  without HIV . 
1.2 Design  
This is a randomized  open -label trial to examine the safety and immunogenicity 
of INO-6160 ( synthetic DNAs encoding a native -like HIV Env Trimer and 
Interleukin -12), alone or in a prime -boost regimen with VRC HIV Env Trimer 
4571 adjuvanted with 3M-052-AF + Alum . The primary hy pothesis is that the 
vaccine regimen  will elicit HIV-1 envelope protein –specific binding antibody 
(Ab) and T-cell responses .

HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 10 of 107 * Up to 5 additional participants may be enrolled  (for a total of 25) , if needed, with a 
goal of approximately  20 participants to contribute to the immunogenicity analyses . 
Specific scenarios that could necessitate enrollment of additional participants in order 
to prevent loss  of statistical power of the study include (but are not limited to) the 
following: loss  of participants due to moving, withdrawal of consent, missing vaccine 
visits, or variations in the clinical care due to unpredictable events.  Participants  will not 
be replaced after visit 5, the visit [ADDRESS_442872] 5 participants (across 
both arms ) and enrollment will pause after the first 5 participants are enrolled. The 
Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) will review cumulative safety information for all 
participants recorded through the visit scheduled [ADDRESS_442873] 5 participants and will determine whether it is safe to proceed with full enrollment.  
1.6 Duration  per participant  
12 months of scheduled clinic visits (main study) and an AESI health contact [CONTACT_355532] 18.

The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) Clinical Research Sites (CRSs) will be 
located in the US and will  be further specified in the Site Announcement Memo.  
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page [ADDRESS_442874]-in-human clinical trial will examine  the safety and immunogenicity of a 
vaccination regimen with a synthetic DNA –encoded stabilized HIV -1 Env 
Native -Like Trimer (sD -NLT -AB05 adjuvanted with IL -12 DNA ), alone or in 
combination with HIV-1 Env Trimer  4571 , adjuvanted with 3M-052-AF + Alum , 
as a boost. The DNA  vectors  will be delivered via ID EP. Vaccination with 
Native -Like Trimer (NLT) via a DNA platform (as opposed to recombinant 
protein) eliminates the need to  express and purify NLTs in vitro, saving time and 
lowering costs .  
Advantages of the synthetic DNA vaccine platform with adjuvant IL -12 DNA  
(pGX6001 ), especially when administered in combination with NLT protein 
boosts, include:  
• The potential to elicit more robust immune responses than protein vaccine 
alone , 
• Potential dose sparing of protein vaccine required in the regimen , and  
• Unique induction of cellular responses to act synergistically with induced 
humoral responses.  
The clinical trial will inform future N LT and DNA clinical studies  for both HIV 
vaccines and non -HIV vaccines , such as sD -NLT germline -targeting trimers to 
activate specific bnAb precursor lineages, sD -NLT heterologous boosting to 
broaden antibody recognition , and sD -NLT prime with protein NLT boosts with 
combinations of NLTs based on more diverse HIV isolates to generate broader 
responses.  
2.1 Rationale for evaluation of sD-NLT-AB05  with IL -12 adjuvant  and 
Trimer 4571 adjuvanted with 3M -052-AF + Alum  in a prime boost 
regimen  
2.1.1  sD-NLT-AB05 with IL -12 adjuvant  
Native -Like Env Trimers (NLTs) : HIV envelope protein (Env) is a 
conformationally dynamic structure that is a key target for HIV vaccine 
development (1, 2) . Preclinical studies demonstrate that recombinant NLTs , 
which resemble ‘native’ Env on the HIV virion surface,  display surfaces 
recognized by  [CONTACT_355533] (bnAbs) capable of 
neutralizing  HIV while simultaneously ensuring that many non -neutralizing 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_355505] (3, 4) . Stabilized NLTs can be engineered by 
[CONTACT_355534]. Recently, we 
optimized NLTs for an advanced synthetic DNA vacci ne delivery platform (sD -
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 12 of 107 NLT). In the sD -NLT formulation, NLT immunogens can be encoded in s ynthetic 
DNA cassettes as transgenes in a clinical plasmid (pVax).   
sD-NLT -AB05  encodes for an  Env trimer derived from the HIV -1 clade A strain 
BG505 (5). The DNA platform is thus refer red to as  “sD-NLT -AB05 .” It is a 
gp140 format modified through a set of directed mutations to produce a stable 
NLT exposing epi[INVESTIGATOR_355506] . It also  occlud es distracting epi[INVESTIGATOR_355507] -neutralizing Abs (eg, on the V3 loop and inner dom ain surface)  
(5, 6) . Similarly , the VRC -HIVRGP096 -00-VP Env trimer ( Trimer 4571 ) is a 
stabilized NLT,  also derived from BG505 in a gp140 format , modified with a 
different set of mutations to prevent CD4 -induced conformational triggering (7-
9). Specifically, the  sD-NLT -AB05 encoded trimer and Trimer 4571 share the 
following amino acid sequence changes : SOS stabilizing mutations (501C, 605C), 
gp41 stabilizing mutation (559P), glycan introduction mutation (332N), and 
improved furin cleavage site mutations (RRRRRR between 507 and 512). They 
differ in 2 sets of changes: Trimer 4571 contains disulfide mutations (201C, 
433C) and sD -NLT -AB05 contains 11 changes to improve biophysical properties 
(T106E, M271I, F288L, N363Q, F519S, A561P, V570H, R585H, L568D, R304V 
and A319Y).  The sD -NLT -AB05 and Trimer [ADDRESS_442875]  the B-cell or T-cell responses.  
IL-12 induces the production of interferon -gamma (IFN -gamma), favori ng the 
differentiation of type 1 T helper (Th1) cells (10, 11) . Biologically active IL -12 
has pleotropic effects but  is generally considered to be a pro -inflammatory 
cytokine that biases the CD4+ T -cell response towards a Th1 phenotype. Previous 
studies have demonstrated that the inclusion of plasmid -encoded IL-12 
(GENEVAX IL -12-4532 ) with HIV PENNVAX -B DNA was dose spa ring (12). 
The inclusion of IL -[ADDRESS_442876] the tolerability of an HIV DNA 
vaccine (13). 
2.1.2  Trimer 4571 adjuvanted with 3M -052-AF + Alum  
In proof -of-concept preclinical studies  in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], Trimer [ADDRESS_442877] administration. Rhesus 
macaques immunized via IM injection with research -grade Trimer 4571 produced 
neutralizing Abs to BG505.W6M.C2.T332N (see the Investigator’s Brochure [IB] 
for more detail on these BG505 variants).  
3M-052-AF contains 3M -[ADDRESS_442878] (TLR7/[ADDRESS_442879]) that induces production of cytokines in vitro from 
immune cells, such as de ndritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes (14-17).  
Nonclinical studies in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], rats, rabbits, and rhesus macaques comparing 
the immunogenicity of the related SOSIP protein BG505 SOSIP.[ADDRESS_442880] consistently shown that the protein 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 13 of 107 adjuvanted with 3M -052-AF + Alum elicits neutralizing and binding Abs more 
quickly, to higher peak magnitudes, and with greater durability than any of the 
other protein -adjuvant combinations tested  (see IB). 
In rhesus macaques, among 8 adjuvants combined with an Env gp140 
immunogen, the Alum/TLR7 agonist was the most potent in assays characterizing 
both Ab and cellular responses. T his hierarchy of potency was sustained 
throughout the longitudinal follow -up. The overall effect of the Alum/TLR 
combination was to boost Env binding Ab titers 3 -10-fold compared to Alum 
alone (18). 
The 3M -052-AF adjuvant is a TLR7/[ADDRESS_442881] added to vaccine antigens to 
generate strong Ab responses in several nonhuman primate (NHP) models, and it 
is currently being evaluated in HVTN 137 and HVTN 300 clinical trials (see 
Section 2.4). Combining 3M -052-AF with Alum results in a synergistic increase 
in immune resp onses to vaccine antigens in preclinical models , including Ab 
titers, CD4+ T -cell responses, infiltrating monocytes and dendritic cells, and B -
cell activation when compared to either Alum or 3M -052-AF alone (14). In NHPs  
immunized with SARS -CoV -2 RBD formulated with 3M -052 combined with  
Alum, several enhanced immune responses were observed, including increased 
Ab titers, RBD binding and effector Abs, Th1 biased CD4+ T cells, and 
protection from SARS -CoV -2 viral challenge when compared to Alum alone (19). 
For additional information, see the IB.  
2.2 Preclinical data  with sD -NLT-AB05 : mice  and rabbits  
In preclinical animal models, DNA -encoded NLTs are capable of inducing 
autologous neutralizing immune responses, and DNA -encoded NLTs act 
synergistically with recombinant protein NLTs in prime -boost regimens. NLTs 
formulated as sy nthetic DNA and delivered by [CONTACT_355535].  
Preclinical studies in mice demonstrated that  sD-NLT -AB05 can  assemble  in vivo  
with a native -like antigenic profile similar to the same recombinant NLT protein 
produced in vitro (see  Figure 2-1, and reference (6)). 
This is the first time NLTs have been shown to assemble directly in vivo  when 
launched from synthetic DNA by [CONTACT_355536]. DNA -encoded NLTs 
folded properly in vivo and  induced the appropriate humoral response, as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_355537] -NLT -AB05 induces autologous tier -2 
neutralizing antibodies (nAbs)  in mice. Comparison of protein versus DNA NLT 
vaccinations in mice demonstrated induction of trimer -binding antibodies by [CONTACT_355538]. High levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell responses, as well as 
autologous tier-2 BG505.T332N neutralization was observed in mice immunized 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 14 of 107 with sD -NLT -AB05 ( Figure 2-2 A and B). However, recombinant protein failed 
to generate either CD8+  T-cell responses or any tier-2 responses in mice, as 
shown by [CONTACT_355539] (20). Neutralizing clones have been isolated and Cryo -
EM employed to molecularly map the murine neutralizing  epi[INVESTIGATOR_355508] -NLT -AB05, which is also a target of protective nAbs  in 
primates (21, 22)  (Figure 2-3 A and B). sD -NLT -AB05 has also been observed to 
generate autologous tier-2 neutralizing respon ses in rabbits  (unpublished data , see 
the IB ). In published macaque studies by [CONTACT_62214], DNA/Env protein co -
administration at the same site during each vaccination can improve induced 
binding and nAb responses (23), as well as challenge outcome (24).

2.3 Clinical Experience with related DNA vaccines  encoding HIV Env 
immunogens with and without IL -12 adjuvant  
Prior clinic al studies (HVTN 070, HVTN 080, HVTN 087, and HVTN 098) have 
demonstrated the safety of DNA -encoded HIV Env immunogens delivered via EP 
and demonstrated consistent induction of Ab and CD4+ T -cell and CD8+ T -cell 
responses. Key features of these trials and summaries of safety are shown in  Table 
2-1. HVTN 098 tested  optimized cocktail formulations  administered via a device 
enhanced for ID EP delivery and resulted in an effi cient platform , generating a

applicable trials are summarized in Table 2-1 above and  include data from over 
300 individuals. DNA vaccines were well tolerated, with no severe systemic 
reactogenicity and no severe related adverse events ( AEs). Two participants who 
received IM injections discontinued further vaccinations due to pain at the 
injection site. It is important to note that there are differences between IM 
injection and ID EP , with ID administration generally being less associated with 
injection site pain.  
Edupuganti et al reported on the safety, tolerability, and acceptability of IM and 
ID EP of the HIV -1 PENNVAX -GP DNA vaccine and IL -12 in HVTN 098 (26). 
Systemic reactogenicity symptoms with IM injecti on of DNA vaccines and  with 
ID injection of DNA vaccines  did not differ (26). Injections were generally well 
tolerated but skin lesions (flat scars) occurred in 49% of participants with ID 
injection s. These changes were found to be acceptable in 96% of participants and 
did not lead to vaccination discontinuation for any participant.  
When the injection and EP are given  in the skin, the needles may leave marks, 
such as red bumps or scabs. The marks may  heal later but may still leave light or 
dark spots or small scars. For some people, these marks have lasted 9 months or 
more (26). These marks tend to be more noticeable on darker skin.  
In an ongoing phase 2/3 clinical trial ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), a SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_442884] 
been reported.  For more details, please see the IB.  
2.3.2  Immunogenicity  
EP improves immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. Experience from the 
immunogenicity results from several prior clinical studies has informed the design 
of the current study. HVTN 070 and HVTN 080 tested the same PENNVAX -B 
DNA vaccine (PV), but with  (HVTN 080) and without (HVTN 070) IM EP (12). 
Comparing the comparable vaccine regimens between these trials (PV+IL -12) 
after the third vaccination, the HIV -specific CD4+ T -cell response rate increased 
from 19.2% to 80.8% and the CD8+ T -cell response rate increa sed from 6.9% to 
51.9% when administered by [CONTACT_151658]. These results clearly demonstrated the markedly 
enhanced T -cell immunogenicity with EP, especially notable for CD8+ T cells 
that previously have not been induced well by [CONTACT_100660]. The responses were 
primarily dire cted to Gag and Pol, and not to Env. Because of this, in HVTN 098, 
the Env expressing DNA vaccine was modified, including two env plasmids 
encoding clade A and C Env immunogens, and including a substitution of an 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 19 of 107 optimized IgE leader as well as the deletio n of their cytoplasmic tail to improve 
surface expression (25). The dose of the env plasmids was also increased relative 
to the gag and pol plasmids.  
ID delivery  is dose sparing.  HVTN 098 compared IM EP and intradermal EP, 
with the ID EP administration at 1/5th the dose of the IM EP. CD4+ and CD8+ 
HIV-specific T -cell responses were equivalent for ID and IM, demonstrating the 
dose-sparing effect of ID EP, with the highest responses to Env. Unlike prior 
trials, Env -specific binding Ab responses were induced in the majority of vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] f or both the ID and IM groups, with higher response rates and/or 
magnitudes for the ID  + IL-12 group for some Env antigens. IgG binding Abs to 
V1V2 Env antigens were detected in up to 56% of participants, with highest 
responses for the ID  + IL-12 group. Neu tralizing antibodies were mainly detected 
only to a tier 1A viral isolate. Only a few participants developed detectable 
antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and these were mainly in the 
ID + IL-12 group. Thus, HVTN 098 demonstrated equivalent o r sometimes 
superior immune responses for ID relative to IM (both including IL -12), and the 
ID route was dose -sparing.  
Inclusion of IL -[ADDRESS_442885] significant differences. Although not statistically significant, the 
response rates including IL -12 were higher than without IL -12 (CD4+ HIV -
specific T -cell response rates increased from 44.4 to 80.8% and CD8+ increased 
from 33.3% to 51.9% after the third dose). In HVTN 098, the CD4+ HIV -specific 
T-cell response rate increased from 56.3% to 96.4% comparing the ID groups 
without and with IL -[ADDRESS_442886] rather than the fourth . The effec t of IL -12 was examined in another HVTN 
study, HVTN 087, that tested increasing doses of IL -12 included with DNA 
administered IM with EP for 3 doses followed by [CONTACT_355540] (VSV) 
boost (28). HIV -specific CD8+ T -cell response rates were generally increased 
when IL -[ADDRESS_442887] IL -12 dose group compared to the group 
without IL -12. Unexpectedly, addition of IL -12 led to significantly decreased 
CD4+ HIV -specific T -cell response rates after the prime for the low - and 
medium -dose groups.

HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 20 of 107 mcg (Group 2), both combined with 500 mcg Alum. The study is ongoing and 
remains blinded to within -group treatment assignme nt. As of April 27 , 2022 , both 
the 1 mcg 3M -052-AF group (6 participants total ; 5 receiving protein/adjuvant, 1 
receiving placebo) and the 5 mcg 3M -052-AF group (11 participants total ; 10 
receiving protein/adjuvant, 1 receiving placebo) completed enrollmen t. Part A of 
the initial protocol specified that participants in Groups 1 and 2 would receive 2 
total doses : one at month 0 and the other at month 2.  
Five out of 6 participants received 2 doses of the 1 mcg dose ( 1 participant 
discontinued for reasons unr elated to vaccination) and 10 out of 11 participants 
received 2 doses of the 5 mcg dose. One participant in the 5 mcg dose group 
(Group 2) decided to discontinue vaccination due to Grade 3 induration/erythema 
first noted on Day [ADDRESS_442889] -vaccination. The maxi mum size of both the induration 
and erythema was measured at 17 x 17 cm on Day 8 (Grade 3). The erythema 
resolved over 3 days and the induration subsided to less than 5 cm on Day 11 
(Grade 1). The induration was measured at [ADDRESS_442890] -injection. At no point was the 
pain/tenderness greater than mild and the participant continued to work. It is 
unknown at present whether this participant received placebo or study product. 
Another participant in Group [ADDRESS_442891] dose for 3 total doses. Nine  (out of 17) participants 
elected to receive a third dose. There were no unsolicited Grade 3 or 4 AEs and 
no related serious adverse events ( SAEs ), adverse events of special interest 
(AESIs ), or deaths in either group  after this third dose . Both local and systemic 
reactogenicity was similar between all 3 doses in participants who received 3 
doses.

Overall, the BG505 SOSIP.664 with 3M -052-AF was generally well tolerated, 
with no unsolicited Grade 3 or 4 AEs, no related SAEs, AESIs, or deaths, and no 
unplanned study pauses. Other than the persistent erythema in one of  the HVTN

consisting of both a DNA vaccine  and an adjuvanted protein vaccine leads to 
improved outcomes in a variety of several preclinical models (23, 29 -31). The 
most directly  relevant study is that of Felber and colleagues in rhesus macaques 
(31). It involved a comparison of vaccination with monomeric HIV envelope 
administered via both DNA and an adjuvanted protein delivered ei ther into the 
same limb or into  contralateral limbs, allowing for a direct comparison of 2 
injections with the same regimen (protein and DNA) at the same time in the same 
limb versus spacing simultaneous injections into contralateral limbs. Vaccination 
targeting the same draining lymph nodes lead to an improvement in a variety of 
immune  outcomes , including functional Ab responses (both increased ADCC 
activity and improved FcRIIIa binding) and  cellular response s (both CD4+ and  
CD8+ ). The proposed mechanism involves simultaneous priming of both CD4+ T 
cells (mostly induced by [CONTACT_100660]) and Env-specific B cells (mainly induced by [CONTACT_355542]) in the same lymph node when injections were 
given in the same limb.  
Most  importa ntly, vaccination targeting the same draining lymph nodes resulted 
in superior protection against  simian -human immunodeficiency virus ( SHIV ) 
challenge  (see Figure 2-5).

HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 32 of 107 4 Laboratory strategy  
4.1 Assessment  of immunogenicity endpoints  
The primary goal of HVTN 304  is to determine whether the  sD-NLT -AB05/  IL-
[ADDRESS_442919] regimen with VRC Env Trimer 4571 
adjuvanted with 3M -052-AF + Alum  will elicit HIV -1 envelope protein specific 
binding antibody (Ab) and T -cell responses.  To this end, HVTN immunogenicity 
assays will be used to measure  both Env-binding Abs and both CD4+ and CD8+ 
Env-specific T cells .  
For the primary endpoints, vaccine matched  HIV-specific binding Ab responses 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_145653] , and r esponse rate and magnitude of CD4 + 
and CD8+ T -cell responses will be assessed  by [CONTACT_4133] . These data will 
also be used to identify and prioritize samples for in -depth immunogenicity 
analyses  (secondary and exploratory endpoints , see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). 
Additional assays may be performed on selected responders and at additional 
timepoints at the discretion of  Protocol Team  leadership  based on its  evaluation of 
primary results following the fourth  vaccination (see Section 3.1).  
The laboratory strategy and the technical details are described in the Central 
Assay Plan and will be updated as new reagents  and techniques are incorporated 
into assay planning. This document will be available on the protocol webpage.

HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 33 of 107 5 Study design  
This is a randomized  trial to examine the safety and immunogenicity of INO-6160 
(sD-NLT -AB05/ IL-12 DNA ) alone or in combination with Trimer 4571  
adjuvanted with 3M -052-AF + Alum in healthy adults. The primary hypothesis is 
that INO-6160 alone or in combination with Trimer 4571  adjuvanted with 3M -
052-AF + Alum vaccinations can induce seroconver sion binding antibody 
responses and induce antigen specific T-cell responses  (both CD4+ and CD8+) .

5.2.1  Delaying vaccinations for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, a participant’s scheduled vaccination will be 
delayed. The factors to be considered in such a decision include but are not 
limited to the following:  
• Intercurrent illness or pre-vaccination abnormal vital signs or clinical 
symptoms that may mask  assessment of vaccine reaction  
• Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone or other 
glucocorticoid), immune targeting monoclonal antibodies or other 
immunomodulators (other  than nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 
[NSAIDs]), with the exception that study injection may continue per principal 
investigator ( PI) discretion if the next study injection occurs at least 2 weeks 
following completion of glucocorticoid treatment;  
• Rece ipt of any live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks prior to study vaccine 
administration ; (Note: ACAM2000 vaccine for Monkeypox received within 
30 days prior to enrollment or receipt of study vaccine; or if ACAM2000 
received greater than 30 days prior to e nrollment or receipt of study vaccine 
and vaccination scab still present; or planned administration within 30 days 
after enrollment or receipt of study vaccine).  
• Receipt of any vaccines that are not live attenuated vaccines within 2 weeks 
prior to study va ccine administration . Replication incompetent vaccines such 
as the Jynneos vaccine for the prevention of monkeypox disease are not 
considered to be live vaccines . 
Vaccinations should not be administered outside the visit window period specified 
in Appendix B  without PSRT approval.   
5.2.2  Discontinuation of study vaccine administration  
Under certain circumstances, an individual participant’s vaccinations will be 
permane ntly discontinued. Specific events that will result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
participant’s vaccination schedule include:  
• SAE that is subsequently considered to be related to vaccination  
• Pregnancy  (regardless of outcome)  
• HIV infection  
• Grade 3 AE assessed as related to  study vaccine  with the exception of fever 
and subjective local and systemic symptoms. For grade 3 injection site

HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 42 of 107 6 Statistic al considerations  
6.1 Sample size justification  and accrual  
Recruitment will target enrolling 10 healthy, adult participants without HIV  per 
group for the 2 study groups receiving either 2 doses of INO-6160  followed by 2 
doses of INO-6160  alone or in combinati on with Trimer adjuvanted with 3M -052-
AF + Alum  (for study schema see  Table 1-1). Up to [ADDRESS_442930] vaccination, all participants 
will provide some safety data. It is possible, however, for immunogenicity dat a to 
be missing; previous HVTN and AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group (AVEG) 
studies suggest 10% is a reasonable estimate for the rate of missing data. For this 
reason, the sample size calculations account for 10% of enrolled participants 
having missing data fo r the primary immunogenicity endpoints.  This 10% 
missingness accounts for both post -processing variables (eg , problems with 
samples)  and is mitigated by [CONTACT_355549].  
6.1.1  Power calculations for imm unogenicity  
The main goal for the analysis is to evaluate the difference of the frequency and 
magnitude of HIV -1 specific binding Ab responses, and the rate of CD4+ and 
CD8+ T -cell responses between the [ADDRESS_442931] and fourth 
vaccin ation . The precision with which  the true response rate can be estimated 
from the observed data depends on the true underlying response rate and the 
sample size. Two -sided 95% confidence intervals ( CIs) for the response rate 
based on observing a particular rate of responses in the study group s is shown in 
Table 6-1. The table indicates n  = 9 per group, assuming a 10% loss of data.

9/9 100 62.9 100 
The estimated differences in response rate, as well as their 95% CIs are shown in 
Table 6-2. Due to the relatively small sample sizes, it is recommended (36) to 
construct th e two -sided response rate difference CIs with Agresti -Caffo interval 
(37) that is  less conservative. The group with higher response rate is assumed to 
have positive response rate of 50%, 70% , and 90%, an d the assumed range of 
response rate differences between 2 groups is 0% to 50%, 70% , and 90% , 
respectively. With sample size of 10 for each group, the statistically significant 
difference in response rates of approximately 50% (44.4% -55.6%) can be detected  
while controlling Type -I error rate at 5%.

study participants in both group s will receive the same sD -NLT -AB05 + IL-12 
DNA  adjuvant ; thus, the safety sample siz e can be doubled. Specifically, for this 
two-arm study with sample size n  = 10 per group (n  = 20* for safety after the first 
2 doses), there is at least a 90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate 
of such an event is 20.6% (10.9%*) or more and there is at least a 90% chance of 
observing no events if the true rate is 1.05% (0.53%*) or less. Safety data will be 
evaluated using historical controls. As a reference, in HVTN vaccine trials

An alternative way of describing the statistical properties of the study design is in 
terms of the 95% CI for the true rate of an AE based on the observed data. Table 
6-4 shows the 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals for the probability of an event 
based on a particular observed rate. If none of the 10 (20* for safety after first 2

6.2 Randomization  
The randomization sequence will be obtained by [CONTACT_22123] -generated random 
numbers and provided to each HVTN CRS through the Statistics and Data 
Management Center’s ( SDMC ) Web -based randomization system. The 
randomization will be done in blocks to ensure bal ance across study groups. At 
each institution, the pharmacist with primary responsibility for dispensing study 
products is charged with maintaining security of the treatment assignments.  
6.3 Blinding  
This is an open -label study. Participants and site staff will be unblinded to 
participants’ group assignments. Laboratory program staff will be blinded to 
participants’ group assignments during assay analysis , whenever feasible . 
6.4 Statistical analyses  
This section describes the final study analysis. All data from enrolled participants 
will be analyzed according to the initial randomization assignment regardless of 
how many vaccinations they received. The analysis is a modified intent -to-treat 
analysis i n that individuals who are randomized but not enrolled do not contribute 
data and hence are excluded. Because of the brief length of time between 
randomization and enrollment —typi[INVESTIGATOR_106742] 4 working days —very 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 47 of 107 few such individuals are expected. All  analyses will be performed using SAS and 
R.  
No formal multiple comparison adjustments will be employed for multiple safety 
endpoints, multiple primary immunogenicity endpoints, or secondary endpoints. 
However, multiplicity adjustments will be made for ce rtain immunogenicity 
assays, as discussed below, when the assay endpoint is viewed as a collection of 
hypotheses (eg, testing multiple peptide pools to determine a positive response).  
6.4.[ADDRESS_442934] of baseline participan t characteristic, safety, and 
immunogenicity for primary - and secondary -objective analyses . 
6.4.2  Baseline demographics  
Participants’ baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics.  
6.4.3  Safety/ tolerability  analysis  
Since enrollment is conc urrent with receiving the first vaccination, all participants 
will have received at least 1 vaccination and therefore will provide some safety 
data.  
Reactogenicity:  The number and percentage of participants experiencing each 
type of reactogenicity sign or symptom will be tabulated by [CONTACT_355550]. For a given sign or symptom, each participant’s reactogenicity will be 
counted once under the maximum severity for all injection visits. Wilcoxon rank 
sum tests will be used to test for differences in se verity between groups.  
AEs and SAEs:  AEs will be coded into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) –preferred terms. The number and percentage of 
participants  experiencing each specific AE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_355551]. For the calculations in these tables, each subject’s 
AE will be counted once under the maximum severity or strongest recorded 
causal relationship to treatment. A complete listing of AEs for each subject will 
provide details including severity, relationship to treatment, onset, duration , and 
outcome.  
6.4.4  Immunogenicity analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical Analysis to address  primary objectives  
The first component of the analysis will entail comparing the frequency of HIV -
1–specific binding Ab responses 2 weeks following the fourth  vaccination. 
Comparison between the 2 vaccine groups will use Fisher’s exact test, while 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 48 of 107 McNemar’s test will be used for paired data (between visits), with a significant 
difference declared if the 2-sided p -value is ≤ 0.05.  
To compare the magnitude of HIV -1–specific binding Ab responses [ADDRESS_442935] with 5% type -I error rate will be performed. Wilcoxon 
signed rank test with 5% type -I error rate will be performed for paired data.  
With the response rates of CD4+ and CD8+ T  cell to HIV -1 specific Env peptide 
pools 2 weeks following the fourth vaccination, the 2 vaccine groups will be 
compared using Fisher’s exa ct test , and McNemar’s test will be used for paired 
data), with a significant difference declared if the 2 -sided p -value is ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_442936] for paired data, with 5% type -I error rate. Graphs will be used to display 
the background -subtracted magnitudes for each participant by [CONTACT_109414], treatment 
arm, and timepoint, with a box plot of data from positive responders 
superimposed on the individual data values. Statistical testing comparing th e 
magnitudes will be based on positive responders only.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General approach  for secondary and exploratory  analyses  
For the statistical analysis of immunogenicity endpoints, data from enrolled 
participants will be used according to the initial randomization as signment 
regardless of how many injections they received. Additional analyses may be 
performed, limited to participants who received all scheduled injections per 
protocol. Assay results that are unreliable, from specimens collected outside of 
the visit win dow, or from HIV -infected participants are excluded. Since the exact 
date of HIV infection is unknown, any assay data from blood draws 4 weeks, or 
less, prior to an infected participant’s last seronegative sample and thereafter may 
be excluded. If an HIV -infected participant does not have a seronegative sample 
post enrollment, then all data from that participant may be excluded from the 
analysis.  
Discrete categorical assay endpoints (eg, response rates) will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_355552]. Crude 
response rates will be presented with their corresponding 95% CI estimates 
calculated using the score test method (38). Fisher’s exact tests will be used to 
compare the response rates of between  2 vaccine groups , with a significant 
difference declared if the 2 -sided p -value is ≤ 0.05.  
For quantitative assay data (eg, magnitude of HIV -1 Env-specific binding Ab 
responses), graphical and tabular summaries of the distributions by [CONTACT_488], 
treatment arm, and timepoint will be made. The difference between arms at a 
specific timepoint will be tested with a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test if 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page [ADDRESS_442937] if the data appear 
to be normally distributed. An appropriate data transformation (eg, log10 
transformation) may be applied to better satisfy assumptions of symmetry and  
homoscedasticity ( constant variance). More sophisticated analyses employing 
repeated measures methodology (for example, repeated measures analysis of 
variance or generalized estimating equations) may be utilized to incorporate 
immune responses over several timepoints and to  test for differences over time. 
However, inference from such analyses would be limited by [CONTACT_355553]. All statistical tests will be 2 -sided and will be considered 
statistically significant if p  0.05.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Missing Data  
Based upon previous AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group and HVTN trials, missing 
10% of immunogenicity results for a specific assay is common due to study 
participants terminating from the study early, problems in shippi[INVESTIGATOR_36406], or 
low cell viability of pro cessed peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMCs ). To 
achieve unbiased statistical estimation and inferences with nonparametric tests 
and generalized linear models fit by [CONTACT_355554] (GEE) 
methods, missing data need to be missing comple tely at random (MCAR). MCAR 
assumes that the probability of an observation being missing does not depend 
upon the observed responses or upon any unobserved covariates but may depend 
upon covariates included in the model (eg, missing more among whites than 
nonwhites). When missing data are minimal (specifically if no more than 20% of 
participants are missing any values), then nonparametric tests and GEE methods 
will be used, because violations of the MCAR assumption will have little impact 
on the estimates a nd hypothesis tests. These models will include as covariates all 
available baseline predictors of the missing outcomes.  
If a substantial amount of immunogenicity data is missing (at least 1 value 
missing from more than 20% of participants), then using the  methods that require 
the MCAR assumption may give misleading results. In this situation, analyses of 
the immunogenicity endpoints at a specific timepoint will be performed using 
parametric generalized linear models fit by [CONTACT_54683]. These methods  
provide unbiased estimation and inferences under the parametric modeling 
assumptions and the assumption that the missing data are missing at random 
(MAR). MAR assumes that the probability of an observation being missing may 
depend upon the observed respon ses and upon observed covariates, but not upon 
any unobserved factors. Generalized linear models for response rates will use a 
binomial error distribution and for quantitative endpoints, a normal error 
distribution. For assessing repeated immunogenicity me asurement, linear mixed 
effects models will be used. If the immunological outcomes are left - and/or right -
censored, then the linear mixed effects models of Hughes (39) will be used 
because they accommodate the censoring. In addition, secondary analyses of 
repeated immunogenicity measurements may be done using weighted GEE (40) 
methods, which are valid under MAR. All of the models described above will 
include as covariates all available baseline predictors o f the missing outcomes.

Ad hoc safety reports may also be prepared for SMB review at the request of the 
HVTN [ADDRESS_442939] approve any other requests for 
safety data prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immunogenicity  
A statistical analysis by [CONTACT_106882] a primary immunogenicity 
endpoint may be performed . The HVTN Laboratory Program will review the 
analysis report prior to distribution to the protocol chairs, Division of AIDS 
(DAIDS ), vaccine developer, and other key HVTN members and investigators. 
Distribution of reports will be limited to those with a nee d to know for the 
purpose of informing future trial -related decisions. The HVTN leadership must 
approve any other requests for HVTN immunogenicity analyses prior to the end 
of the scheduled follow -up visits. Any analyses conducted prior to the  end of the 
study should not compromise the integrity of the trial in terms of participant 
retention or safety or immunogenicity endpoint assessments.

conducted remotely, such as via phone, text message, email, or other electronic 
means, in lieu of, or in combin ation with, in -person visits.  As long as they are 
completed within the visit window (see Appendix B ), procedures  for a study visit 
can be completed over multiple days.  
8.3 Reactogenicity Assessments  
Reactogenicity definition:  Signs and symptoms considered to represent 
reactogenicity from the vacc ine include systemic events of increased body 
temperature, fatigue, generalized myalgia, generalized arthralgia, headache, chills, 
nausea, and local events at the injection site including pain/tenderness, induration 
and erythema.  
The reactogenicity assess ment period is the day of vaccination and [ADDRESS_442952] not resolved 
within the reactogenicity assessment period.  
Pre-vaccine Administration:  Intercurrent illness  assessment  and evaluations 
(including vital signs and planned injection -site evaluation ) are performed prior to 
each vaccine  administration .

HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 58 of 107 Guidance for participants scheduling licensed vaccines or allergy 
immunotherapy:  In order to prevent interference with reactogenicity assessment, 
participants who plan to receive licensed vaccines or allergy immunotherapy 
should be counseled to avoid scheduling receipt of these substances, when 
possible, within t he 2-week interval after study -product administration. To avoid 
unnecessary delays in study -product administration, participants should be 
counseled to avoid scheduling receipt of these substances before study -product 
administration (see Section 5.2.1 ). 
Post-vaccine administration in -clinic evaluation : Following the enrollment  
vaccine administration, participants will be observed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_442953] administration . For all subsequent administrations , 
participants will be observed for a minimum of 30 minutes  with the following 
exception: for Group 2, participants will be observed for [ADDRESS_442954] administration of Trimer 4571 + 3M -052 AF + Alum scheduled for Month  3. 
During this time, vital signs will be recorded, the injection site will be i nspected  
for evidence of local reaction, and any evidence of systemic symptoms will be 
assessed.  
Post-vaccine administration contact [CONTACT_46144]:  Remote or in -person 
contact [CONTACT_355561] o n 
the third or fourth  day following vaccination. Any postvaccination reaction grade 
2 or higher will be assessed by a clinician within 48 hours after onset unless the 
reaction is improving and/or has completely resolved. Additionally, other clinical 
concer ns may prompt a study visit based on the judgment of a study clinician.  
Symptom diaries : Participants are asked to record symptoms on a daily basis 
using an electronic participant diary  (eDiary) . A paper alternative is available . All 
participants will be given a thermometer for oral temperature measurement, a 
ruler , and access to the eDiary  (paper alternative available) . All participants will 
be provided training on diary completion, proper thermometer usage, and the use 
of the measurin g device to measure any injection site induration and/or erythema. 
Participant s will use the diary to record daily their highest temperature as well as 
local and systemic signs and symptoms for the day of vaccination and 14 full days 
following each vaccine  administration . Participant diaries will be reviewed by a 
clinician and reconciled for accuracy and completeness.  Attribution assessment 
will be performed and recorded on a case report form ( CRF ) for systemic 
reactogenicity events reported in the particip ant diary after additional evaluation 
of the participant by [CONTACT_30223] . 
8.4 EP-injection–site assessment  
To document the appearance of injection sites over time, the area to be injected 
will be assessed prior to receipt of an injection, and at subsequent scheduled 
visits. The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate the appearance of the 
injection sites afte r time has allowed for healing. A description including type and

HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page [ADDRESS_442955] (Section 8.8). Please see HVTN 304 Study -specific 
Procedures (SSP)  for further details.  
8.5 Visit windows and missed visits  
The schedule of visits and evaluations performed at each visit is shown in  
Appendix A . Visit windows are shown in Appendix B . The procedures for 
documenting missed visits and out of window visits are described in  the HVTN 
304 SSP.  If the missed visit is one that required safety assessments or local safety 
labs, HVTN CRS staff should attempt to bring the participant in for an interim 
visit as soon as possible.  
8.6 Monitoring for HIV infection  
Study participants will be tested  for HIV in fection periodically throughout the 
study per the HVTN HIV testing algorithm as noted in Appendix A . Participants 
will be promptly informed and counseled if they acqu ire HIV during the study 
and will be referred for treatment  (see Section 5.2.2 ). 
Study participants will receive regularly scheduled counseling regarding 
avoidance o f HIV infection in accordance with the most recent Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention HIV counseling guidelines.  
Although the study vaccine will not cause HIV infection, it may induce Abs 
detect able by [CONTACT_355562]. T his is referred to as 
vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). The following steps will be taken to 
protect participants from adverse consequences associated with VISP:  
• Participants will be counseled to avoid HIV Ab testing outside of the HVTN 
CRS during stu dy participation.  
• Participants can receive HIV diagnostic testing from the CRS following their 
last scheduled visit until they are told they do not have VISP.  
• Participants with VISP will be periodically offered free-of-charge poststudy 
HIV diagnostic testi ng (per the HVTN poststudy HIV testing algorithm) as 
medically/socially indicated (approximately every 6 months) unless or until 
HIV Ab testing is no longer standard in clinical settings . 
• Unless the participants request that their names be removed, the names of all 
participants in HVTN studies are entered into a secure VISP registry i n order 
to verify that an individual received an HIV vaccine (and therefore has the 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 60 of 107 potential for VISP ) and to qualify former participants for post -study HIV 
testing to dist inguish between VISP and HIV infection . Information in the 
VISP registry is not used for research.  
8.7 Early termination visit  
If a participant terminates participation in the study early for any reason, the site 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_355523] s are appropriate : end -of-study HIV 
test, CBC with differential, serum chemistry, physical examination, and if 
indicated, a pregnancy test (see Appendix A ). If a participant acquires HIV, 
please see Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_442956] the information listed below  and will perform an  abbreviated  EP-
injection –site assessment  that can be conducted over the phone . If indicated, the 
participant may be asked to come in for a clinical assessment , which may also 
include referrals for AESI assessment. AESIs are described further in  Appendix 
F. 
• Confirmation  of vital status; if deceased, attempt to learn cause and date of 
death  
• If participant is alive, record the participant’s responses to the following:  
▪ SAEs; 
▪ AESI s (a sample list of AESI s is provided in Appendix F ). AESIs are 
reported regardless of relationship to study product(s);  
▪ Medically attended adverse events ( MAAEs ), defined as any AEs leading 
to an unscheduled visit to a healthcare professional , which are reported 
regardless of relationship to study product(s);  
▪ New diagnosis of HIV infection; and  
▪ Pregnancies and outcomes, including congenital anomalies/birth defects.  
All such events will be recorded and AEs will be assessed for rel ationship to 
study vaccines .

HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 61 of 107 9 Safety and adverse events  
9.1 Adverse events  
Unsolicited AEs will be collected over a period of 30 days after each vaccination. 
All collected AEs are captured in the clinical database  on the appropriate CRF. 
Clinic staff should eval uate every AE to determine if (1) the AE meets the 
requirements for expedited reporting (see Section 9.2.1 ), (2) the AE meets the 
criteria for a safety pause/prompt AE review (see Section  9.6), (3) the AE meets 
the criteria for an MAAE, and (4) the AE is a potential immune -mediated disease 
that may be listed as an AESI. A sample lis t of AESI s is provided Appendix F . 
In addition , a limited set of AEs will be collected and reported for [ADDRESS_442957] vaccine  administration  the participant receives : 
• SAEs/EAEs,  
• AESIs,  
• MAAEs ,  
• AEs leading to ear ly participant withdrawal or early discontinuation of study 
vaccine(s) administration.  
AEs will be graded according to the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of 
Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1  
(https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinica l-research -sites/daids -adverse -event -grading -
tables) , with the following exceptions :  
• Unintentional Weight Loss is required to be reported as an AE only if it is 
considered to be potentially deleterious to the participant’s health (see HVTN 
304 SSP). 
• Injection Site Erythema or Redness and Injection Site Induration or Swelling 
will not consider surface area and interference with usual social and functional 
activities , such that:  
▪ Grade 1 is: 2.5 to < 5 cm in diameter  
▪ Grade 2 is: ≥ 5 to < 10 cm in diameter  
▪ Grade 3 is: ≥ 10 cm in diameter OR Ulceration OR Secondary infection 
OR Phlebitis OR Sterile abscess OR Drainage  
▪ Grade 4 is: Potentially life -threatening consequences (eg, abscess, 
exfoliative dermatitis, necrosis involving dermis or deeper tissue)

HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 62 of 107 9.2 Serious adverse events  
The term “Serious Adverse Event” (SAE) is defined in 21 CFR 312.32 as follows:  
“An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the 
view of either t he investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death,  
• A life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967],  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions,  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgmen t, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emerg ency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse. ” 
“Life -threatening” refers to an AE that, at occurrence , represents an immediate 
risk of death to th e subject. Similarly, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355524] a n SAE .  
9.2.1  Expedited reporting of adverse events to DAIDS  
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of AEs are 
outlined in Version 2.0 (January 2010) o f the Manual for Expedited Reporting of 
Adverse Events to DAIDS (DAIDS EAE Manual), which is available on the 
Regulatory Support Center  (RSC ) website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -
research -sites/manual -expedited -reporting -adverse -events -daids . 
The DAIDS Adverse Experience  Reporting System (DAERS) , an internet -based 
reporting system, must be used for expedited AE  (EAE)  reporting to DAIDS.  In 
the event of system outages or technical difficulties, EAEs may be submitted 
using the DAIDS EAE Form. This form is available on the DAIDS RSC website 
at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/paper -eae-reporting .

within the DAERS application itself.   
For questions about expedited reporting, please contact [CONTACT_355563]@tech -res.com.  
The SAE Reporting Category will be used  throughout the study.  After completion 
of the  study , the suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( S[LOCATION_003]R ) 
reporting category will be used  if clinical staff becomes aware of an event on a 
passive basis.  
The study product s and investigational device for which expedited reporting are 
required are: 
• INO-6160 , 
• [Trimer 4571  + 3M -052-AF + Alum ], and  
• EP Device . 
The NIAID/DAIDS will report all unexpected SAEs related to the study products 
observed i n this clinical trial to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (IND 
Safety Reports).  
9.3 Safety monitoring  
9.3.1  Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT)  
The PSRT comprise s: DAIDS Medical Officer , Protocol Chair, Protocol C ochair ,

the Protocol Team (Clinic Coordinator, Clinical Data Manager, Clinical Trial 
Manager , vaccine developer representative (s), and others ) may also be included in 
HVTN [ADDRESS_442959] (SMB)  
The SMB is a multidisciplinary group consisting of biostatisticians, clinicians, 
and experts in HIV vaccine research that, collectively, has experience in the 
conduct and monitoring of va ccine trials. Members of the SMB are not directly 
affiliated with t he protocols under review.  
The SMB reviews safety data  (including cumulative reactogenicity events, AEs, 
laboratory safety data, and individual SAE reports) approximately every 4

full enrollment.  
9.6 Safety pause and pr ompt PSRT AE review  
The PSRT (see Section 9.3.1 ) will closely monitor participant safety . The trial can 
be paused at any time for any reason by [CONTACT_111153].  When a trial is placed on 
safety pause, all enrollment and vaccination will be held un til further notice. The 
AEs that will lead to a n immediate  safety pause or prompt HVTN 304  PSRT AE 
review are summarized in Table 9-1. Vaccinations may be suspended for safety 
concerns other than those described in the table, or before pause rules are met, if, 
in the judgment of the HVTN 304  PSRT, participant safety may be threatened. 
Criteria for an individual participant’s departure from the schedule of vaccinations 
are listed in Section 5.2.3 .

9.6.1  Plan for review of pause rules  
For all safety pauses, HVTN Core notifies the HVTN 304  PSRT, HVTN 
Regula tory Affairs, DAIDS Pharmaceutical Affairs Branch (PAB), DAIDS 
Regulatory Affairs Branch (RAB), DAIDS Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team 
(SPT), and participating HVTN CRSs. When an immediate safety pause is 
triggered, HVTN Core notifies the SMB.  
Once a tria l is paused, the HVTN 304  PSRT reviews safety data and decides 
whether the pause can be lifted or permanent discontinuation of vaccination is 
appropriate, consulting the SMB if necessary. HVTN Core notifies t he 
participating HVTN CRSs, HVTN Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS PAB, DAIDS 
RAB, and DAIDS SPT of the decision regarding resumption or discontinuation of 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page 66 of 107 study vaccinations. Based on the HVTN 304  PSRT assessment, DAIDS RAB 
notifie s the FDA as needed.  
If an immediate HVTN 304  PSRT notification or prompt HVTN 304  PSRT AE 
review is triggered, HVTN Core notifies the HVTN 304  PSRT as soon as possible 
during working hours (local time)  or, if the information was received during off 
hours, by [CONTACT_106934]. If a prompt HVTN 304  PSRT AE 
review cannot be completed within 72 hours of  notification (excluding weekends 
and US federal holidays), an automatic safety pause occurs.  
The HVTN requires that each CRS submit to its IRB/EC and any applicable RE 
protocol -related safety information (such as IND safety reports, notification of 
vaccin e holds due to the pause rules, unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others, and notification of other unplanned safety pauses). CRSs 
must also follow all applicable RE reporting requirements . 
9.7 Study termination  
This study may be termin ated early by [CONTACT_106936] 304  PSRT, 
the NIH, the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Office for 
Human Research Protections (OHRP), the FDA, or study product developers. In 
addition, the condu ct of this study at an individual HVTN CRS may be terminated 
by [CONTACT_106937]/EC and any applicable RE.  
9.[ADDRESS_442963],  should be completed unless 
medically contraindicated or applicable regulations require termination from the 
study. During follow -up of persons who are confirmed pregnant, pregnancy 
testing  is not required unless clinically indicated. If the participant terminates 
from the study prior to the pregnancy outcome, the site should make every effort 
to keep in touch with the participant in order to ascertain the pregnancy outcome. 
Pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes will be reported as described in the HVTN 
304 SSP. 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page [ADDRESS_442964]  
This research study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP)  (ICH E6 (R2)) , HVTN and DAIDS policies and 
procedures as specified in the HVTN Manual of Operations  and the DAIDS 
Clinical Research Policies and Standard Procedures Documents, and all 
applicable regulatory requirements. These polici es and procedures include 
protocol monitoring (on -site and remote) and compliance. DAIDS and HVTN 
policies and procedures are available for review by [CONTACT_355565]/EC/RE upon request. 
Any policies or procedures that vary from DAIDS and HVTN standards or require 
additional instructions (eg, instructions for randomization specific to this study) 
will be described in the HVTN [ADDRESS_442965], and follow -up of its research, ensuring that 
locally appropriate cultural and linguistic needs of study populations are met. 
Community Advisory Boards (CAB) are required by [CONTACT_355566] t in accordance with Good 
Participatory Practices (GPP) and all local and national guidelines.  
10.[ADDRESS_442966] comply with regulations set forth in the NIH’s 
Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid  
Molecules  (April 2019) . Information about the study must be submit ted to the 
Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC)  for each CRS. Investigators at each CRS  
are responsible for obtaining IBC approval per NIH guideline Section IV -B7-a-
(1). IBC review and approval must be documented by [CONTACT_355567]’s initial protocol registration for this trial  before 
participants are enrolled at the CRS . If this protocol is amended, investigators 
should follow the requirem ents of their respective IBC.  
10.3 Informed consent  
The sample  informed consent form ( SICF) in Appendix C  describes the 
investigational vaccine  and all aspects involved in study participation . 
Documentation of appropriate informed consent must be in place prior to 
conducting study procedures with participants. Periodic assessment of 
participants’ continued understanding of key study concepts and informed consent 
must also be documented.  Study sites are strongly encouraged to have their local 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11,  2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page [ADDRESS_442967] the participants’ decisions to 
stay in the trial, this information will be shared with trial participants. If 
necessary, participants will be asked to sign revised informed consent forms.  
An HVTN CRS may employ recruitment efforts prior to the participant 
consenting. For example, some HVTN CRSs use a telephone script to prescreen 
people before they come to the clinic for a full screening visit. Participants must 
sign a screening or protocol -specific consent before any procedures are performed 
to determine eligibility. HVTN CRSs must submit recruitment and prescreening 
materials to their IRB/EC and any applicable RE  for human subjects protection 
review and approval.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_442968] approval from their IRB/EC and any applicable RE to 
use a general screening consent form that allows screening for an unspecified HIV 
vaccine trial. In this way, HVTN CRS staff can continually screen poten tial 
participants and, when needed, proceed quickly to obtain protocol -specific 
enrollment consent. Sites conducting general screening or prescreening approved 
by [CONTACT_11577]/EC and any applicable RE may use the results from this screening to 
determine eligi bility for this protocol, provided that the tests are conducted within 
the time periods specified in the eligibility criteria.  
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN304_v2.0_Final  / Page [ADDRESS_442969] with the language in the SICF  (Appendix C ) 
may be performed on samples .  
11.1 Specimen storage and other use of specimens  
The HVTN stores specimens from all study participants indefinitely unless a 
participant requests  that specimens be destroyed or if destruction or a time limit 
for storage is requir ed by [CONTACT_1744]/EC or RE.  
“Other use of specimens ” is defined as studies not covered by [CONTACT_106927] ( see Appendix C ). 
This research may relate to HIV, vaccines, the immune system, and other 
diseases. This could include genetic testing and, potentially, genome -wide studies. 
This research is done only to the extent authorized in each study site’s informed 
consent form, or a s otherwise authorized under applicable law. Other research  on 
specimens (“other use”) will occur only after review and approval by [CONTACT_106885], 
the IRB/EC of the researcher requesting the specimens, and the IRBs/ECs/REs of 
the CRSs if required.  
As part of co nsenting for the study, participants document their initial decision to 
allow or not allow their specimens to be used in other research, and they may 
change their decision at any time. The participant’s initial decision about other 
use of their specimens, and any later change to that decision, is recorded by [CONTACT_106928] a Web -based tool that documents their current decisions for other use of 
their specimens. The HVTN will only allow other research to be done on 
specimens from participants who allow such us e. 
CRSs must notify HVTN Regulatory Affairs if institutional or local governmental 
requirements pose a conflict with or impose restrictions on specimen storage or 
other use of specimens .

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or 
ask someone to read it to you . If you decide to join the study, we will ask you to 
sign or make your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will 
ask you questions to see if we have explained everything clearly. You can also 
ask us questions about the study.  
Key information  
• This is the first study in which one of the study vaccines will be given to 
people.  
• Being in this research study is voluntary. It is your choice.  
• You are being asked to take part in this study because you are age [ADDRESS_442996]  HIV, and are generally healthy.  
• The purpose of this study is to see if the study vaccines are safe and to see 
how a person’s immune system responds to the m. 
• You will be in this study for up to [ADDRESS_442997]  1 year after your las t vaccination  to check on your health . 
• Procedures will include blood draws and injections of study vaccine s. 
• One of the study  vaccines will be given with electroporation  (EP). This 
procedure  uses a handheld device to  give an electrical pulse into the skin 
where the injection is given . We will tell you more about this procedure and 
its risks later in this consent form.   
• There are risks from participating.  We will tell you more about all of them 
later in this consent for m. The most common risks are as follows:  
▪ Taking blood and giving injections can cause  bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore  and bleeding . 
▪ The EP device can cause pain ranging from mild to severe that goes away 
quickly. It c an also cause soreness, bruising, redness, swelling, itching, or 
hardness/stiffness in the arm where you got the EP. There is also a risk of 
marks on the skin, such as red bumps, scabs, and changes in skin color 
that may last for 12 months  or longer . 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN 304_v2.0_Final  / Page 78 of 107 ▪ Becau se one of the vaccine s has not been given to people before , and the 
other vaccine has only been given to a few people,  we do not know what 
all of the risks may be.  
• We do not expect the study vaccine s to benefit you in any way.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and [Insert site name] are doing a 
study to test 2 HIV vaccine s. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  
Up to 25 people will take part in this study. The researcher in charge of this study 
at this c linic is [Insert name [CONTACT_107002]] . The US National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) is paying for the study.  
1. We are doing this study to answer three critical  question s. 
• Are the study vaccines safe to give to people?  
• Are people able to take  the study vaccines without becoming too 
uncomfortable?  
• How do people’s immune systems respond to the study vaccines? (Your 
immune system protects you from infections and disease.)  
2. The study vaccine s cannot give you HIV.  
The study vaccine s are not made fro m HIV. It is impossible for the study vaccine s 
to give you HIV. Also, they cannot cause you to give HIV to someone else.  
We do not know if the study vaccine s will decrease, increase, or not change your 
risk of getting HIV if you are exposed to the virus.  
3. The study vaccine s are experimental.  
We are testing 2 study vaccine s and a study adjuvant .  
One is  called INO-6160 . We will call it the DNA vaccine . It is ma de up of 2 
different pi[INVESTIGATOR_355526] , sD-NLT -AB05  + interleukin -[ADDRESS_442998] a stronger response.  3M-052 was originally 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 1 1, 2023  
HVTN 304_v2.0_Final  / Page [ADDRESS_442999] 
that has been used in approved vaccines for more than 90 years.  
Everyone in this study will get the DNA vaccine. It will tell your body to make 
small amounts of 2 different proteins. One of them is a protein that is found in 
HIV, and the second protein is called IL -12. IL-12 is naturally found in people. 
Your body’s immune system might recognize the HIV protein and prepare itself 
to fight HIV by [CONTACT_355570] T cells. IL -[ADDRESS_443000] diseases. You cannot get HIV 
or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or from the proteins the body makes in response 
to it. 
Some people in the study will also get the protein vaccine  and the study adjuvant . 
The immune system might be able to see this pi[INVESTIGATOR_355527].  
Where do the study products com e from ? 
The DNA vaccine was developed by [CONTACT_355571]  (Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvan ia) and formulated by [CONTACT_343423] . It is provided by [CONTACT_355572] a grant from the NIH.  
The protein vaccine was developed and is provided by [CONTACT_355573]  (VRC) , which  is part of the NIH .  
The 3M -052-AF adjuvant was developed , manufactured  and is being provided  by 
[CONTACT_355574] (AAHI)  in Seattle, Washington. Alum is 
being provided by [CONTACT_106951] (DAIDS ) in Bethesda, Maryland , which 
is part of the NIH.  
What do we know about the study vaccines from other studies?  
The DNA  vaccine has not been given to people before. Similar HIV DNA  
vaccines  with the same IL -[ADDRESS_443001] Alum was given to people as part of 2 
different on going studies. In one study, VRC018, 16 people got the same protein 
vaccine mixed with the Alum adjuvant  that we will use in this study . Each person 
got 3 injections  of the vaccine and adjuvant at the same dose or higher than the 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN 304_v2.0_Final  / Page [ADDRESS_443002] within about a week.  
In the second study, NIAID 19 -I-0069, 3 people got a single dose of the same 
protein vaccine combined with Alum at a higher dose than the one we will us e in 
this study. These injections did not cause any serious health problems . This study 
is still ongoing and plans to enroll up to 100 people.   
Another  protein  vaccine  and the same 3M-052-AF + Alum adjuvant being used in 
this study  are being test ed for the  first time in people in [ADDRESS_443003] some injection 
site reactions during the trial, mostly mild to moderate. One (1) person  had severe 
pain/tenderness in both the right and left injection sites 3 days followin g the 
fourth vaccination, though it lasted only one day.   
All people had some side effects that they described as mild to moderate. Five (5) 
people had severe side effects, including chills, headache, muscle aches, and 
generally feeling unwell. These sever e side effects went away within 2 days. Of 
the 5 people who had severe side effects, 2 decided to stop getting study 
injections because they felt gene rally unwell  after injections and it was affecting 
their daily lives. Another 2 of the 5 people who had se vere side effects got more 
injections; one of them had more severe side effects while the other did not. And 
one (1) of the [ADDRESS_443004] on its own. This person decided to stop getting any more 
injections. There were 4 people who exp erienced stronger side effects. These 
included chills, headache, muscle aches, and generally feeling unwell. Because 
the study is ongoing and is blinded, we do not know if th ese people  got the study 
vaccine with the adjuvant or a placebo  (sterile salt water with no vaccine in it) .  
Given the side effects experienced in HVTN [ADDRESS_443005] 
that many people in this study who receive the 3M -052-AF + Alum adjuvant will 
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN 304_v2.0_Final  / Page [ADDRESS_443006] would be similar to the Risks of 
vaccines  listed below . 
These are experimental HIV vaccines, which means we do not know if the 
vaccines will be safe to use in people, or if they will work to prevent HIV 
infection. These vaccines are used only in research studies . 
Risks of vaccines:  
All vaccines can cause fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, dizziness, 
feeling tired  and generally feeling unwell . Vaccines can also cause pain, redness 
or itching where you got the injection. Most side effects do not interfere with 
daily activities or make a person visit the doctor.  
Rarely, a vaccine can cause an allergic reaction, including a rash, hives, or trouble 
breathing. Allergic reactions can be life -threatening. Tell us if you ever had a bad 
reaction to an injection or vaccine.  
Risks of DNA vaccine s: 
More than [ADDRESS_443007] the risks of the DNA vaccine in this study to be similar to 
those of other DNA vaccines.  
Risks of the protein vaccine:  
This protein vaccine has been give n to a small number of people so far and no 
serious health concerns have been reported . Because of this, we do not know all 
the side effects. There may be side effects, even serious or life -threatening ones, 
that we do not know about yet.  
Risks of the study adjuvant:  
The combination of the protein vaccine and adjuvant used in this study has not 
been gi ven to people before, so we do not know all the risks. However, the 
adjuvant in combination with other similar protein vaccines is being given to 
people for the first time in other studies. A small number of people have received 
these vaccinations so far. A few of them have reported having some of the side 
effects described in the “ Risks of vaccine s” section above , but no serious health 
concerns have been reported so far.  
These are  the side effects we know about. There may be others that we don’t 
know about . We will tell you if we learn about new sid e effects that could affect 
your willingness to stay in the study.  
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN 304_v2.0_Final  / Page [ADDRESS_443008] 350 people . 
In another study, a DNA vaccine , together with IL -12 adjuvant , were given into 
the skin with EP to 55 people. EP has not caused any serious health problems in 
these participants.  
In a previous study using the EP device in healthy volunteers, some people said 
that they felt only a little discomfort, while others said  it was very painful, even 
after the injections were over. However, only 3 out of 48 volunteers left the study 
because of pain and discomfort.  
Another large study being done in multiple countries is currently giving EP with a 
DNA vaccine for SARS -CoV -2 (the virus that causes COVID -19). The study 
began in November 2020, and so far over [ADDRESS_443009] been reported so 
far. 
Risks of EP: 
EP cause s brief muscle contractions during the procedure. In previous studies 
using EP, people  felt initial pain t hat ranged from mild to severe. For most people , 
the pain eased quickly. EP can also cause soreness, bruising, redness, swelling, 
itching, or hardness/stiffness in the upper arm where you got the injection. When  
the injection and EP are given to the skin, the needles may leave marks such as 
red bumps and scabs. Later the marks may heal but might leave lig ht or dark spots 
on the skin . In some people, these marks lasted [ADDRESS_443010] not been given with EP before. In addition, every person’s skin can react 
differently. We will  show you photos of people who got EP in a previous study to 
give you examples of what these injection marks can look like over time.  
Site: Sites must review the samp le photos  of EP injection marks with 
potential participants during the study informed consent process.  
HVTN  304 Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN 304_v2.0_Final  / Page 83 of 107 On rare occasions, the EP device may cause infection at the part of your body 
where you got the injection.  
Having the procedure or thinking about it may cause some stress and anxiety. If 
you feel anxious, please tell us and we wil l try to help you.  In a previous study 
where a DNA vaccine was given into the skin with EP, over 99% of the 
participants said they would recommend EP with an effective HIV vaccine to 
their family/friends if it felt the same as their study experience , and  96% of these 
participants said that the appearance at injection sites was acceptable.   
We do not know if EP will change the risks for the DNA  vaccine . We do not 
know all the risks of EP because it has only been used  in a limited number of 
people before this  study and not with this DNA vaccine.   
Joining the study  
5. It is up to you whether or not to join the study.  
Take your time. Talk to people you trust. If you decide not to join this study or if 
you leave after you have joined, that will not affect your other care at this clinic 
and the benefits or rights you would normally have.  
You cannot be in this study while you are in another study where you get a study 
product. If you do not join this study, you may be able to join another study.  
During the study, you should not donate blood or tissue.  
Site: Remove item [ADDRESS_443011], and health history. A physical 
exam may include, but is not limited to:  
• Checking your weight, temperature, and blood pressure  
• Looking in your mouth and throat  
• Listening to your heart and lungs  
• Feeling your abdomen (stomach and liver)  
We will also do blood tests. These tell us about the health of  your kidneys  and 
liver. We will ask you about medicines you are taking , including HIV pre -
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).  We will ask you about behaviors that might put you 
at risk for getting HIV. If you were as signed female sex at birth, we will test you 
for pregnancy.

must use birth control to join this study.  
Site: If you want to include Appendix E, Approved birth control methods (for 
sample informed consent form), in this consent form, paste it below and delete 
paragraph below.  
It is important that you not become pregnant during the study because we do not 
know how the study vaccine could affect a developi[INVESTIGATOR_106784]. For this reason, you 
must agree to use effective birth control from [ADDRESS_443013] study injection  at 6 months  (for a total of 
9 months) . We  will talk to you about effective  birth control  methods . They are 
listed  on a handout  that we will give to you. 
You also should not begin the process to have your eggs collected until [ADDRESS_443014].

When we take blood, the amount will depend on the lab tests we need to do. It 
will be some amount between 10 mL and 243 mL ( 2 teaspoon s to about 1  cup). 
These samples are below the maximum of [ADDRESS_443022] the blood we take out 
within 4 to 8 weeks.

13. We will counsel you about protecting yourself from HIV.  
We w ill ask you questions about your risk factors for being exposed to HIV , such 
as sexual behavior, alcohol, and drug use. We will talk with you about ways to 
keep your risk of exposure to HIV low.

immune system , responds to the study vaccine s. 
We will send your samples (without your name [CONTACT_29097]) 
to labs approved by [CONTACT_355576]. In rare cases, some of your samples 
may be sent to labs in other countries fo r research related to this study.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples. Your genes are passed 
to you from your birth parents. They affect how you look and how your body 
works. This genetic testing will involve only some of your genes, not all of your 
genes (your genome). It will involve genes related to the immune system and 
HIV. 
If you get HIV, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the virus found in 
your samples. The researchers will use this information to learn more about HIV 
and how the virus is impacted by [CONTACT_106365] s. 
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
These tests done on your samples are for research purposes, not to check your 
health. Th e labs will not give the results to you or this clinic because their tests 
are not approved for use in making health care decisions. These labs are only 
approved to do research tests.   
When your samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN will co ntinue 
to store them . 
15. When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to use 
them in other studies and share them with other researchers.  
The HVTN calls these samples “extra samples .” The HVTN will only allow your 
extra samples to be used  in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your 
decision at the end of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
Do I have to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, the  HVTN will destroy all extra samples 
that it has. Your decision will not affect your being in this study or have any 
negative consequences here.  
Where are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. [Site: ch oose one of the following two sentences. African sites 
should choose the sentence referencing the repository in South Africa. All other 
sites should choose the sentence referencing the repository in the [LOCATION_002].]  
Your samples will be stored in the HV TN repository in South Africa. Your 
samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the [LOCATION_002].  
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN 304_v2.0_Final  / Page 89 of 107 How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be stored. [Site: Revise the previous sentence to insert limi ts if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, 
there is no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you are.  
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. 
They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
research purposes.  
Will the HVTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN may share 
your samples with HVTN or other researchers. Once the HVTN shares your 
samples and information, it may not be able to g et them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and information? When a researcher 
wants to use your samples and information, their research plan must be approved 
by [CONTACT_106885]. Also, the researcher’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics 
Committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106954]’s 
IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this .] IRBs/ECs protect the 
rights and well -being of people in research. If the research plan is approved, the 
HVTN will send  your samples to the researcher’s location.  
What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers? The samples and 
information will be labeled with a code number. The key to the code will stay at 
this clinic. It will not be shared with the HVTN, other researchers, or with anyone 
else who does not need to know your name.  Your name [CONTACT_107003]. However, some information that the HVTN shares may be personal, 
such as your race, ethnicity, sex, health information from the study, and H IV 
status. The HVTN may share information about the study product you received 
and how your body responded to the study product.  
What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the imm une system and other diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome -wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them  understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it, but your name [CONTACT_107004].

Other Risks  
19. There are other risks to being in this study.  
In addition to the risks of the study vaccine  and the procedures that were 
described above , this section describes the other risks we know about. There may 
be other risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn anything new that 
may affect your de cision to stay in the study.  
Risks of abnormal laboratory results :  
Minor changes in  laboratory test results occasionally happen. This means that the 
test results can show something to be abnormal when it is not. If this happens, we 
will ask you to come ba ck to the clinic to be retested. This may cause you to 
worry , and it may be inconvenien t to come back to the clinic . If retesting confirms 
something to be abnormal, we will provide care or help you get the care you need.  
Risks of routine medical procedures : 
Routine medical procedures such as taking blood and giving injections can cause 
bruising, pain, fainting, soreness, redness, stinging , swelling, itching, a sore, 
bleeding, and rarely infection where you got the injection. Taking blood can cause 
a low blood cell count (anemia), making you feel tired.  
Personal problems/discrimination/testing HIV antibody positive:  
Some people report personal problems or discrimination because they joined an 
HIV vaccine study. Family or friends may worry, get upset, or as sume that you 
have HIV. Rarely, someone has lost a job because the study took too much time 
away from work, or because their employer thought they had HIV.  
Most vaccines cause the body to make antibodies to prevent infection. Your body 
may make antibodies to HIV because you received an HIV study vaccine . Those 
antibodies could cause you to test positive on some types of HIV tests, even if you 
do not have HIV. This is called vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). VISP 
means that after you get the study vacci ne, a routine HIV test done outside this 
clinic is likely  say you have HIV, even if you don’t. For this reason, you should 
get HIV tests only at this clinic. Our tests can tell the difference between true HIV 
infection and a positive result caused by [CONTACT_941] s tudy vaccine . If you have VISP, we 
can arrange free HIV testing for as long as you need it.  
It is unlikely, but you could test antibody negative at the end of the study and then 
test positive sometime later, even though you don’t have HIV.  
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN 304_v2.0_Final  / Page 94 of 107 Site: Modify t he following paragraph if applicable.  If someone believes you have 
HIV, you could face discrimination and other problems. In some countries, you 
could be denied medical or dental care, employment, insurance, a visa, or entry 
into the military. If you have VISP, you will not be able to donate blood or 
organs. Your family and friends may treat you differently. We will give you a 
brochure that tells you more about VISP, and how you can avoid some of these 
problems.  
If you become pregnant during or after the st udy and have VISP, the antibodies 
might be passed to your baby. We know that this happens with some other 
vaccines. The antibodies are not a danger to the baby [CONTACT_355579], usually in 
about [ADDRESS_443028] 
VISP, we can arrange this testing for free for as long as it is needed.  
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask questions about HIV risks, su ch as sex 
and using drugs. Also, waiting for HIV test results could make you feel anxious. 
You could feel worried if test results show that you have HIV. If you feel 
embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and we will try to help you.  
Risks of disclosure of  your personal information:  
Although the risk is very low, it is possible that someone who should not may see 
your personal information. If that happens, you could face discrimination, stress, 
and embarrassment. We can tell you more about how we will prote ct your 
personal information.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
It is possible that genetic tests could show you may be at risk for certain diseases. 
If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. However, 
genetic test results are not part  of your study record, so it is almost impossible for 
anyone to connect them to you personally.  
Even if your genetic information somehow gets linked to your name, a federal law 
called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) helps protect you.  
GINA keeps health insurance companies and employers from seeing results of 
genetic testing when deciding about giving you health insurance or offering you 
work. GINA does not help or protect you against discrimination by [CONTACT_355580], disabilit y, or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
HVTN 304  Version 2.0  / January 11, 2023  
HVTN 304_v2.0_Final  / Page [ADDRESS_443029] health problems you don’t yet know about.  
When asked, most study  participants  say that participating in a study made them 
feel good about helpi[INVESTIGATOR_38609], increased their knowledge about HIV, and 
improved their self -esteem.  
This study may help in the search for a vaccine to prevent HIV. However, if the 
study vaccine s later become ap proved for sale, there are no plans to share any 
money with you . 
Your rights and responsibilities  
21. If you join the study, you have rights and responsibilities.  
We list these in the Bill of Rights and Responsibilities  (BRR) for HIV Research . 
We will give you  a copy of it . 
Leaving the study  
22. Tell us if you decide to leave the study.  
You are free to leave the study at any time and for any reason. This will not affect 
your care at this clinic and your legal rights.  
Previously collected information about you will  remain in the study records and 
will be included in the analysis of results. Your  information cannot be removed 
from the study records.  
We will ask you to come to the clinic one last time for a physical exam, and a 
pregnancy test, if indicated . We may ask to take some blood samples.  Whether 
you come for this last visit is up to you.

Your health is important to us . (Sites: Adjust the following 2 sentences if 
applicable to the care available at your site)  We will tell you about care that we 
can give here. For care that we cannot provide, we will explain how we will help 
you get care elsewhere.  
If you become sick or injured in this study, the HVTN has a process to decide if 
this is related to the study vaccine  and/or procedures. If it is, we call it a study -
related injury. There are funds to pay for treatment of study -related injuries if 
certain conditions are met.  
In this study, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will pay the cost of medical care that 
arise s from injuries caused by [CONTACT_355581]-[ADDRESS_443031] of medical care from injuries caused by [CONTACT_941] 3M -052-AF 
adjuvant. For injuries caused by [CONTACT_355582], t he 
HVTN has limited funds to pay medical costs that it determines are reasonable . If 
the injury is not study related, then you and/or your health insurance will be 
responsible for t reatment costs.  
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by 
[CONTACT_106965]. Or you might lose wages because you cannot go 
to work. However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if 
they are study related.  
You may disagree with the decision about whether your injury is study related. If 
you wish, the HVTN will ask independent experts to review the decision. You 
always have the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied.

The following are intended as guidelines for the investigator to help identify 
potential vaccine trial participants at “low risk” for HIV infection.  These 
guidelines are based on behaviors within the last 6 -12 months prior to en rollment; 
however, it may be appropriate to consider a person’s behavior over a longer

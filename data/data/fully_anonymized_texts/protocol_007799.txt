Protocol Summary  
 This is a randomized, open- label  clinical investigation of the effects of short -term oral 
metformin therapy on biomarkers for tumor growth in subjects with endometrial cancer. Metformin 
is a well- tolerated drug widely prescribed for treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and for 
treatment of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) in non- diabetic women (1, 2).  Clinical trials are 
ongoing to explore this possibility in breast cancer  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). This investigation is the first 
study of metformin in endometrial cancer patients, and is designed to understand the mechanism of its anti -cancer actions, if any, and its interactions with biomarkers in endometrial cancer 
patients.  
 Forty non -diabetic subjects will be randomized so that 20 will receive oral metformin for 
14-21 days and the remaining 20 will receive no metformin for 14-21 days. Subjects will be 
moni tored for adverse events (AEs).  All subjects will have blood samples collected on Day 1 
(prior to start of metformin for subjects randomized to metformin) and prior to surgery.  These 
samples will undergo metabolic, lipid and tumor- specific biomarker analyses. Tumor and adjacent 
normal tissue taken from subjects from the diagnosis and at the time of surgery will be analyzed for cellular proliferation, apoptosis and biomarker levels.  
The Primary objectives  of this study are as follows:  
1. To determine the effect of metformin on tissue markers of proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin -mediated signaling in endometrial cancer in non- diabetic obese women.   
2. To determine the tolerability of a short course of metformin in non- diabetic obese women 
with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer. 
The Secondary objectives of this study are as follows:  
1. To determine the effect of metformin on HbA
1c and blood lipid profiles measured at baseline 
and just before surgery.  
2. To determine the effect of metformin on the following hormones measured in blood plasma at baseline and just before surgery:  Insulin, IGF -I, leptin, and adiponectin.  
3. To determine the effect of metformin on the expression levels of mRNAs and miRs measured in blood plasma at baseline and just before surgery.  
4. To determine the effect of metformin on the expression levels of mRNAs and miRs  
measured in tumor and adjacent non- tumoral uterine tissue.  
Background and Rationale  
 Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the [LOCATION_002] , 
with approximately 45,000 cases per year 
(3). The single biggest risk factor for development of 
this disease is obesity (4).  There is a direct correlation between the extent of obesity and the 
development of endometrial cancer.  Peripheral adipose tissue contains high amount of the 
enzyme aromatase , which converts androstenedione into estrone.  This source of estrogen then 
exerts a proliferative effect on the lining of the uterus , leading over time to endometrial hyperplasia 
and carcinoma.  This type of endometrial cancer is referred to as Type I and represents ~80% of 
all endometrial cancers in this country (5).  More recently it has been shown that obesity is a risk 
factor for insulin resistance leading to higher levels of circulating insulin. If the insulin resistance is great enough, obesity will lead to diabetes. 
Serum insulin levels have now been shown to have a direct correlation with the 
development of endometrial cancer
 (6).  Case -control studies have documented higher serum

insulin levels in women who develop endometrial cancer versus women who underwent 
gynecologic surgery for benign disease (7).  Both insulin and insulin- like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) 
are highly associated with endometrial cancer.  In one study, women with high circulating insulin 
levels had a hazard ratio of 2.33 for developi[INVESTIGATOR_370059], after adjusting for age and estradiol(8).  
High insulin levels are associated with the metabolic syndrome, which includes insulin resistance, 
elevated circulating hormones, obesity, elevated lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and can clinically manifest as anovulation 
and infertility. The metabolic syndrome in women is often referred to as the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). In these women, medical reduction of circulating insulin leads to improvements in all factors associated with the metabolic syndrome, including an increase in ovulatory cycles and improved pregnancy rates
 (9).  Metformin, a biguanide compound, is a 
primary therapy used to treat insulin resistance associated with type II diabetes.  Among diabetics 
on metformin, there is a reduction in the development of cancer and the rate of cancer death (10).  
It is not precisely known how metformin reduces the development of cancer.  The reduction in 
cancer is not seen with other diabetic treatments such as sulfonylureas and insulin.  
Since the early 1990s, metformin has been used to treat PCOS.  A meta -analysis of the 
use of metformin and polycystic ovary syndrome in 2003 documented from controlled trials a significant improvement, compared with placebo,  in ovulation rates, pregnancy rates, fasting 
insulin levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol
(9).  It is important to note that these studies were 
performed in non- diabetic women.  Metformin is now used routinely as therapy for PCOS.  
Because high circulating levels of insulin have been associated with t he development of 
endometrial cancer, reduction of insulin levels with metformin may have a direct effect on the development or maintenance of this cancer.  Anecdotal reports have occurred of women with early low -grade endometrial cancer being successfully  treated with a regimen including metformin
 
(11).  Also, women who had initially responded to progesterone therapy for endometrial cancer and 
then became resistant, showed a renewal of progesterone response when they were started on 
metformin (12).  Laboratory data has documented that metformin is a potent inhibitor of endometrial 
cancer -cell proliferation (13).  Metformin has also been shown to promote progesterone receptor 
expression in endometrial cancer cells and to reverse progesterone resistance in endometrial 
cancer cells by [CONTACT_370068] (14, 15).  Progesterone receptor expression and 
sensitivity in endometrial cancer are associated with improved clinical outcomes.  
 Arkansas is one of the top states for obesity in the [LOCATION_002].  More than 30% of the 
adult population is characterized as obese, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or higher (16). At 
UAMS, we see approximately [ADDRESS_462973] in treatment of endometrial 
cancer. This drug also has the potential to be a chemo- preventive agent in women at high risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_370060].  There is currently no randomized trial to investigate the influence of metformin on endometrial cancer in obese non- diabetic women.

Proliferation Markers  
Human endometrial cancer cell lines ECC -1 and Ishikawa, when treated with metformin, 
showed decreased proliferation and decreased hTERT expression relative to non-t reated cells 
(17). In women treated with metformin to manage PCOS, sera from PCOS women after 6 months 
of metformin significantly decreased the invasive properties of ECC -1, in part, by [CONTACT_370069]-
inflammatory NF -κB expression and activation of Akt and Erk1/2 pathways (18). Further, the 
increase in progesterone receptor expression in metformin-treated Ishikawa and HEC -1B cells 
was associated with pathways targeted by [CONTACT_370070].    
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will evaluate the effect of metformin on endometrial tumor -cell 
proliferation and apoptosis, obesogenic and pro -tumorigenic marker gene expression, and anti -
oncogenic micro -RNA (mIR) expression. mIRs are potentially important regulators of expression 
of tumor -enhancing and tumor -suppressing pathway components. Endometrial tumors and 
adjacent non -involved tissues will be obtained at surgery. Tissues will be processed for 
histopathology and immunohistochemistry, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA and protein 
analyses. Fasting blood sera will be obtained prior to and after the 14-to-21-day treatment period 
for measurement of insulin, adiponectin, leptin, and IGF- 1 levels. Fixed tumor and ‘normal’ tissues 
will be analyzed for markers of proliferation (Ki67; phospho -histone H3) and apoptosis (T UNEL), 
and for expression of estrogen receptor (ER)α, progesterone receptor (PR), and tumor suppressor PTEN by [CONTACT_9064].  Isolated tissue RNAs will be assessed for PR, PTEN, ERα, KRAS,  and hTERT transcripts by [CONTACT_4503] -PCR. Protein extra cts will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_370071], PTEN, total and activated Akt and Erk 1/2, and insulin receptor 
expression. Sera from both groups at both time points  will also be subjected to analysis using 
miR- profiling arrays. Data obtained from analyses of all biological endpoints will be compared 
using standard statistical procedures.  
 The efficacy of metformin in potentially reversing the pro- tumorigenic parameters of 
endometrial cells (to be evaluated in adjacent non -involved endometrium) has  not been previously 
explored. Our studies may provide information on a subset of patients who are more likely to 
respond to metformin based on their endocrine profiles and clinico- pathologic factors, and hence 
may lead to metformin as a standard chemopreventive strategy for women with high risk for EC. The analyses of metformin- responsive mIRs that are associated with EC may also offer non -
invasive biomarkers for predicting women diagnosed with lower stage of EC and who are likely to suffer from EC recurre nce.

To minimize imbalance between treatment arms, the randomization procedure will employ 
a stra tified block randomization with randomly chosen blocks of size 2, 4, and 6, and with 
BMI as the stratification factor.  Randomization will be conducted using sealed envelopes 
located at the Cancer Clinical Trials Office (CCTO) .  There will be two sets of c onsecutively 
numbered envelopes, one set for subjects with BMI from [ADDRESS_462975] .   
Methods for ensuring blinding.  
Not applicable: this is an open- label study . 
Methods for unblinding the study.  
Not applic able: this is an open- label study . 
Procedure for unblinding in case of medical emergency. 
Not applicable: this is an open- label study . 
Metformin will be administered to patients  (randomized to receive metformin)  for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_462976]’s first post -operative visit . 
B. Blood Draws and Laboratory Tests  
Blood will be drawn from each subject, approximately 18 mL in purple top vacutainer s, 
prior to treatment assignment  (if not preformed previously as conventional care)  and after 
completion of the therapy at the time of surge ry.  The blood sample below will be subjected 
to the following tests at the UAMS Clinical Laboratory:    
a) A comprehensive metabolic panel (glucose, calcium, albumin, total protein, sodium, 
potassium, CO 2, chloride, BUN, creatinine, ALP, ALT, AST and total bilirubin), to be 
performed prior to starting treatment  only.  
b) A lipid panel (cholesterol, HDL- C, LDL -C, triglycerides), to be performed both prior 
to treatment assignment  and at the time of surgery.  
c) Determination of HbA1c, to be performed both prior to treatment assignment  and at 
the time of surgery.  
 
The blood samples listed below will be utilized for correlative laboratory studies in the  
research laboratory of [CONTACT_370085] at the UAMS Biomed Bldg . Aliquots of each 
blood sample will be centrifuged to separate out the plasma portion. Plasma will be stored at -80°C in the Co- Investigator’s lab until analysis is performed.

Page 11 of 21 
The following biomarkers will be assayed in the plasma samples collected at baseline and 
at the time of surgery through enzyme- linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or multiplex 
assays. All of these tests will be performed by [CONTACT_370072]. Rosalia Simmen’s 
lab:  
a) Insulin  
b) Leptin 
c) Adiponectin 
d) IGF-I and IGF- II  
 Remaining plasma samples will be subjected to global profiling of miRs and mRNAs to evaluate/validate the relative expression of specific candidate metformin- regulated miRs 
and mRNAs ([CONTACT_370086]’s lab). miR and mRNA  levels will be determined using 
quantitative SYBR green -based real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) assays and a microarray platform. These tests will be performed in Dr. F rank 
Simmen’s laboratory by [CONTACT_370073]/or by [CONTACT_370074]. 
C. Tissue Specimens  and Laboratory Tests  
A sample of tumor with adjacent normal mucosa will be obtained after surgery from the Pathology department from the tissue remaining after normal gross and histological assessments.   
Fresh tissue samples will be transported by [CONTACT_370075]. Rosalia 
Simmen’s laboratory  at the  UAMS Biomed Bldg .  Fixed tumor and ‘normal’ tissues will be 
subjected to IHC for markers of proliferation ( Ki-67, phospho -histone H3), and apoptosis 
(TUNEL, cleaved caspase- 3). Tumor (and ‘normal’) tissues will also be examined by 
[CONTACT_370076]/or ELISA for expression levels of FASN, total and phosphorylated insulin receptors, and total and phosphorylated IGF- I receptors. Total and phosphorylated AMPK 
levels will be assessed by [CONTACT_370077]. Lastly, tissues will be used for miR and mRNA profiling.        
D. Subject Data  
Subject data to be obtained and recorded will consist of the following:  
a) Patient characteristics: gender; age; BMI; race and ethnicity; smoking status (including approximate packs per day for current and former smokers); alcohol intake.  
b) Tumor characteristics: tumor stage; tumor differentiation status (well, moderate, poor); lymph node involvement; depth of invasion; tum or margins.   
c) Comprehensive metabolic panel: glucose, calcium, albumin, total protein, sodium, potassium, CO
2, chloride, BUN, creatinine, ALP, ALT, AST and bilirubin.  
d) Lipid panel: cholesterol, HDL- C, LDL -C, triglycerides.

E.  Subject Diary  
A subject who is randomized to metformin will receive a diary on Day 1.  The subject is to 
record the date and time of self -administration of the study drug.  The diary will be 
reviewed weekly by [CONTACT_370078].  The diary 
will be collected at the subject’s post -operative visit .   
F.  Treatment modifications 
Patients will be monitored for their ability to tolerate the study medication  during w eekly 
follow -up telephone calls.  If necessary, anti -diarrheal or anti- emetic therapy may be 
prescribed to ease any discomfort associated with the medicine.  If a patient cannot 
tolerate the study medication and misses two or more doses in a row, they will  be 
withdrawn from the study.   
G. Subject removal  
Any patient who develops a grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal toxicity while on study will be discontinued.   Subjects that withdraw from the study or that are withdrawn from the 
study due to unacceptable toxicity will return all unused study drug at their next scheduled 
clinic appointment.

Feasibility of Study Population R ecruitment:  
At the UAMS Gynecologic Oncology clinic, approximately 160 new cases of endometrial 
cancer in obese women are seen each year (three new cases per week).  The majority of these 
women are not diabetic at the time of the diagnosis of endometrial c ancer.  This represents the 
target population for this study.  All new patients are seen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Burnett or [CONTACT_370087].  Except in

Risks and Benefits  
A. Potential toxicities, risks and precautions  
Blood Samples: Pain and bruising at the injection site and rare infections can occur.  
Experienced personnel will perform the phlebotomies using approved techniques.  
Pressure and dressings will be used to minimize pain, bruising and infection. 
Metformin Treatment: Common (50%  of the time ): Diarrhea; Rare (10 – 25% of the 
time ): Nausea or vomiting, gas; Very rare (1 – 10% of the time ): Weakness, 
indigestion, abdominal discomfort, headache, taste changes, abnormal stools, pain in 
the muscles, lightheadedness or dizziness, difficulty breathing, nail probl ems, 
increased sweating, flu -like symptoms, flushing, feeling of a fast beating heart.  
Very rare side effects include Hirsutism (rare), lactic acidosis (3 cases per 100,000 
patient years; 1) occurs most often in individuals with concomitant renal and liver  
disorders, 2) who are 80 years of age or older, 3) who have heart, liver or kidney failure, 4) who have a history of heavy alcohol intake.  
B. Potential Benefits  
 It is unknown if 14-21 days of metformin treatment will provide any therapeutic benefit. 
For this reason, there is no guaranteed personal health benefit for subjects participating in this study.  However, information obtained from this study may improve prevention and treatment of endometrial cancer for individuals in the future.

Rockefeller Cancer Institute under the direction of the research pharmacist.  
Outcome Measures  
 
A. The primary endpoints of this study consist of the following:  
a. IHC-based tissue markers of proliferation: Ki67, phosphorylated histone H3, 
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and telomerase (hTERT).   
b. IHC-based tissue markers of anti- proliferation and apoptosis:  PTEN, KLF9, 
cleaved caspase- 3, and TUNEL staining.  
c. IHC-based tissue markers of insuli n-mediated signalling:  total and phosphorylated 
versions of Akt, Erk1/2, AMPK, and receptors for Insulin, IGF- I, and IGF- II. 
d. Meformin- related adverse events.  
B. The secondary endpoints of this study consist of the following:  
a. Blood levels of HbA
1c and the lipid- panel analytes (cholesterol, HDL- C, LDL -C, 
triglycerides).  
b. Plasma hormone levels (Insulin, IGF -I, IGF -II, leptin, and adiponectin).  
c. Plasma -measured expression levels of mRNAs and miRs, measured using 
quantitative RT- PCR and miR- profiling microarrays, respectively.  
d. Tissue- measured expression levels of mRNAs and miRs, measured using 
quantitative RT- PCR and miR- profiling microarray, respectively.

Monitoring  
Medical Monitor:  The Medical Monitor, Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_370063], once the PI [INVESTIGATOR_370064], to review safety data (adverse events, serious adverse events and other scientific observations).  
Study  Monitor:  The study will be monitored to ensure that the rights and well -being of 
human subjects are protected, that the data are accurate, complete and verifiable from source documents and that the trial is conducted in compliance with currently approved 
protocol/amendments on a quarterly basis.  
Statistical Considerations  
General approach:   For each tissue endpoint, the tumor -NTU difference will be calculated 
in each patient as the paired difference in values between tumor and adjacent NTU tissue.  For each blood endpoint, the endpoint response to treatment will be calculated in each 
patient as the paired difference between post -study and pre -study values.  All data will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_370081], standard deviation (SD), median, and range, and will be graphed as box plots.  Tumor -NTU differences and endpoint responses will be 
compared against zero via signed -rank test within each treatment arm.  Treatment arms 
will be compared to each other for differences via Wilcoxon rank -sum tests, with additional 
details provided below.  All statistical comparisons will be two- sided, and will employ a 
10% alpha to reduce Type II error in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_370065] -of-concept study.   
 
Analysis plan for tolerability:   Meformin- related adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_370082] , both as proportions at each grade and as average grades (i.e., mean 
scores).  For each type, the Wilcoxon rank -sum test will be used to compare treatment 
arms for differences in average grade.    
 
Analysis plan for the IHC- based primary endpoints:  The IHC -based primary endpoints will 
be measured in tissue, and will include markers of proliferation (Ki67, phospho- histone 
H3, ERα, PR, and hTERT), anti -proliferation and apoptosis (PTEN, KLF9, cleaved 
caspase- 3 and TUNEL staining), and insulin- mediated signalling (total and 
phosphorylated versions of Akt, Erk1/2, AMPK, and receptors for Insulin, IGF-I, and IGF -

II).  Endpoints measured in tumor tissue, adjacent NTU tissue, and tumor -NTU differences 
will b e summarized and graphed as described above.  Wilcoxon rank -sum tests will be 
used to compare endpoints measured in tumor, and likewise endpoints measured in 
adjacent NTU tissue, for differences between the metformin and no-metformin  treatment 
arms.   
 
Analysis plan for secondary endpoints measured in blood or plasma:   The secondary 
endpoints measured in blood will be the levels of HbA 1c, cholesterol, HDL- C, LDL -C, and 
triglycerides.  The secondary endpoints measured in plasma will be the plasma hormone 
levels (Insulin, IGF-I, IGF -II, leptin, and adiponectin) and the plasma-measured expression 
levels of mRNAs and miRs .  Endpoints measured at pre- study and post -study, and 
endpoint responses to treatment will be summarized and graphed as described above.  
Wilcoxon rank -sum tests will be used to compare endpoint responses to treatment for 
differences between the metformin and no- metformin treatment arms.   
 
Analysis plan for secondary endpoints measured in tissue:   The secondary endpoints 
measured in tissue will be the expression levels of mRNAs and miRs.  Endpoints 
measured in tumor tissue, adjacent NTU tissue, and tumor -NTU differences will be 
summarized and graphed as described above.  Wilcoxon rank -sum tests will be used to 
compare endpoints measured in tumor, and likewise endpoints measured in adjacent NTU tissue, for differences between the metformin and no-metformin treatment arms.  
 
Sample Size and Power: There will be [ADDRESS_462983] will be used at 10% alpha to 
compare all endpoints and endpoint responses for differences between the metformin arm and the no-metform in arm.  This study will be considered sufficiently powered to meet 
research objectives if the Wilcoxon rank -sum test has >90% power at 10% alpha to detect 
a treatment -arm difference of 1.[ADDRESS_462984] case scenario, 20 subjects per treatment arm (for a total of 40 su bjects) give the two- sided Wilcoxon rank -sum test 91.6% power at 10% alpha to 
detect a difference of 1.0 SDs between the metformin and no-metformin arms, thereby

Dissemination of Data  
  The results will be analyzed after the analysis of all the blood and tissue samples. Then the two groups will be compared and the statistical analysis will be performed. The results will be submitted for presentation at national meetings, manuscripts will be written for 
publication and the data will be used to apply for additional funding from federal agencies 
including the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI).

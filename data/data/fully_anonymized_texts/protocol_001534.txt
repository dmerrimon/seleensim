This material is the property of Olleyes, Inc. Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_625720]-adjusted  reference  values of the visuALL Field Analyzer  
(vFA), to assess the repeatability  for each parameter  and correlate  them 
with a Standard Automatic Perimetry (SAP) parameters . 
Study Rationale  Standard Automatic Perimetry (SAP) is the gold standard test for the 
evaluation of different diseases of the visual pathway like glaucoma. Its 
main goal is to measure the differential light sensitivity at several 
location s of the central field of vision. Nevertheless, the  accuracy of the 
current device  is limited by [CONTACT_625721], stressful examinations and frequency of 
testing among others.1,[ADDRESS_833679] been developed since the advent of the Octopus 
Perimeter3-5 and the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA),6,[ADDRESS_833680] variants are implemented using laptops and iPads and virtual reality 
headsets.10-13  
These modalities bring port ability but the lack of fixation methods , 
environmental control and hardware standardization may limit its wide 
usage.  
The main goal of this study is to evaluate the repeatability of a novel 
psychophysical platform that take s advantage of a Head Mounted De vice 
(HMD) with eye tracking capabilities. Other objectives of this study 
include the development of an initial reference database and the 
evaluation of it s correlation with HFA parameters.  
 
Study Design  visuALL -1 is a cross-sectional observational study . The primary endpoint 
of the study will be at end of the recruitment phase.  
Participants  A group of  healthy subjects and patients with glaucoma ; between 21 and 
80 years old will be invited to participate in the study . A total of 50 
healthy eyes and  an additional 50 eyes with glaucoma will be recruited 
for this study.  
All subjects will undergo a complete ophthalmologic examination at the 
glaucoma department of Wills Eye Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Each examination will 
include refraction, slit lamp biomicroscopy of the a nterior segment, IOP 
measurement, BCVA,  visual field and visuALL Field Analyzer (vFA) testing,  
gonioscopy and dilated stereoscopic fundus examination of the retina 
and optic nerve head. Data about family history of glaucoma will also be 
recorded.

Healthy criteria   Normal appearing optic nerve  and retina  
 IOP < 19 mmHg.  
 Normal SAP results in both eyes. (See SAP criteria)  
COAG criteria   Glaucomatous appearing optic nerve  and/or retina (i.e. increased 
cup to disc area ratio, rim thinning or RNFL defects indicative of 
glaucoma)  
 Abnormal SAP  results in the study eye. (See SAP criteria)  
Exclusion criteria  1. A spherical refraction outside ± 3.0 D and cylinder correction 
outside 2.0 D.  
2. Unreliable  SAP (false positives, fixation losses and false negatives 
>25% and/or observable testing artifacts).  
3. Unreliable vFA (>25% false positive, excessive fixation losses)  
4. SAP abnormality with a pattern of los s which is consistent with a 
neurologic and/or other ocular diseases  than glaucoma .

vFA Description   vFA Pro will be used for this validation study. T he visuALL system is 
composed of  two main parts  - the hardware and the software.  
The hardware includes three main components: A Head Mounted Device 
(HMD) also known as Virtual Reality (VR) headset, a Laptop and a 
Bluetooth connected handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].  
The HMD is powered by [CONTACT_625724] (Fove, Inc. Tokyo, Japan). This HMD weight 
520g and includes  a Wide Quad High Definitio n Organic Light Emitted 
Diode ( WQHD O LED) display with a resolution of 2560x1440 pi[INVESTIGATOR_625717] a 
refresh rate pf 70Hz . The display is divided in two halves (one for each 
eye) with a resultant resolution of 1280x1440 pi[INVESTIGATOR_625718]. The 
display measures  125.[ADDRESS_833681] d at a distance to 
subtend a field of view (FOV) up to 100 degrees.   
The HMD includes several tracking systems, inertial measurement units 
(IMUs) consisting of gyroscopes and accelerometers, in addition to 
infrared -based (IR ) position tracking  with two arrays of 6 IR sensors . 
The HMD uses 2 e ye-tracking system including infrared cameras with a 
frame rate of 120fps. The eye-tracking system has a resolution of less 
than 1 degree.  
The main PC components are a graphic processing units (GPU) NVIDIA 
GeForce GTX 970, a central processing unit (CPU) Intel Core i7 7th Gen 
7820HK (2.90 GHz) , random access memory (RAM) of 32GB, a hard disk

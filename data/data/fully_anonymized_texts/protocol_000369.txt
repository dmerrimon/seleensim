 1 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
1.1 Primary Objectives (1a and 1b) 
This study will examine the feasibility of a SNF-PC intervention in persons with Alzheimer’s and 
related dementias (ADRD) and cognitive impairment (MCI) and address patient/caregiver r eported 
outcomes including quality of life, symptom management, and satisfaction.  
1a: Establish the feasibility of the SNF-Palliative Care (PC) intervention, determined  by: (1) 
percentage of all post-acute SNF patients with ADRD/CI who meet eligibility criteria; (2)  
percentage of eligible patients with ADRD/CI and legally authorized representatives 
(LAR)/surrogate decision makers (also called a caregiver) who participate in the st udy; (3) 
percentage of participating patients with ADRD/CI who receive the SNF-PC and from whom all 
data are collected; and (4) clinician fidelity to the SNF-PC protocol (defined as 90% adh erence to 
protocol elements). 
1b: Measure patient/caregiver reported quality of life, symptom management, and satisfactio n 
with care post SNF-PC in a two-arm non-randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_270828] [ADDRESS_330222]/CI. 
  
1.2 Secondary Objectives (2) 
This study will compare the demographics, clinical characteristics, and palliative ( PC) needs of 
people with ADRD/CI versus non ADRD/CI serious illnesses during post-acute SNF care in NHs. 
 
2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus 
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are serious, life limiting illness es with no known 
cure. ADRD are often underdiagnosed in older adults yet cognitive impairment (CI) is of ten an 
early/middle stage of the dementia continuum with about one third of older adults wit h mild cognitive 
impairment developi[INVESTIGATOR_270829] 5 years.1 Dementia is the fifth-leading cause of death in older 
adults 2 and the majority of people with advanced dementia die in nursing homes (NHs). 3 Miller et al 
reported that 40% of U.S. NH residents dying with advanced dementia received Skilled Nursing Facilit y 
(SNF) care in the last [ADDRESS_330223]-acute rehabilitation service delivered in NHs focused on intense 
rehabilitation and/or aggressive, disease-modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Regardless of life expectancy, use of SNF 
care precludes access to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249]. 5,6 Palliative care (PC) offers an evidence-based alternative. [ADDRESS_330224] in SNFs. 7,8 Key components of 
PC are: 1) open discussion of illness trajectories, and establishment and communication of pat ient- 
and family- directed goals that guide health care; 2) aggressive prevention, early identification and  
treatment of illness-related symptoms; and 3) identification of psycho-spi[INVESTIGATOR_270830] l needs and 
approaches to mitigating suffering. 9,[ADDRESS_330225] can 
increase advance care planning and improve patient and caregiver satisfaction. 12 
Version 1.0  6 
  
The evidence-based SNF-PC encounter is a multi-component non-pharmacologic primary care 
provider delivered intervention designed to meet the PC needs of persons living with dementi a 
(PLWD) receiving post-acute care in NHs. Components focus on assessing and managing 
symptoms, conducting and documenting goals of care conversations, communicating needs, 
recommendations, and treatment preferences of the NH team members.

4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
4.1 Key Inclusion Criteria  
Patients: 1)  admitted for SNF post-acute care at a participating NHs following a recent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 2) age g 60 yea rs old, 3) speaks English (if verbal), 4) if non-verbal/unable to 
participate in a conversation and/or unable to make decisions, has a legally authorized 
representative (LAR)/surrogate decision maker who can make decisions for the patient as 
determined by [CONTACT_270842],  5) documented ADRD or CI (BIMS f 12) diagnosis in the medical 
record, 6) at least one global indicator for PC at SNF admission (provider would not be surprised if 
patient died within 1 year, believes the patient would benefit from advance care planning or 
symptom management; frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270831]; complex care requirements;  
decline in function; feeding intolerance; unintended decline in weight; or previous hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270832]). 
 
Surrogate/LAR: 1)  > 18 years old;  2) family member or friend of an eligible patient as determined 
by [CONTACT_270842]; 3) speaks English 
 
4.2 Key Exclusion Criteria  
Patients:  1) who have previously received or are referred for PC by [CONTACT_270843], 2) 
with a discharge plan within 48 hours of screening, 3) currently receiving hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677], 4) who do

4.[ADDRESS_330228] at Acts at designated times  that 
are predetermined and convenient for Acts staff weekly (this will vary based on thei r schedules). 
Study team members will then call the designated points of contact [CONTACT_270844] r eceive new 
SNF unit admissions each week using the Screening Script for Acts. The study team will attem pt to 
recruit all residents who meet inclusion criteria. The study team member will then cont act 
designated Acts staff to screen and review medical records using the inclusion criteria to determ ine 
eligibility remotely. The research staff will not be cold calling potential part icipants. Acts staff will 
not be engaged in the research. 
Global indicator of need: Acts staff will be given a copy of these forms to review medi cal records 
remotely with research staff. The purpose of this form is to confirm if the resident has a t least one 
global indicator of need. If the resident is found to not have a global indicator of need, they will be 
excluded from the study. Those who meet these criteria will be contact[CONTACT_270845]. 
Once the study team has the list of eligible residents from the facility, they  will contact [CONTACT_153718] (eligible patients or the LAR/surrogate decision makers of eligibl e patients) by [CONTACT_270846]. If they decide they want to enroll, 
study team members will arrange a convenient time to administer the baseline Palliative C are 
Outcome Scale version 2 (POSv2), Satisfaction with Care at the End of Life in Dementia (SWC-
EOLD, and the Symptom Management at the End of Life in Dementia (SM-EOLD) with each 
patient or LAR/surrogate decision maker. 
If patient names are provided by [CONTACT_270847], study staff will ensure they are recorded separate from t he 
primary database and are used only for the necessary amount of time to complete enrollment aft er 
which the record will be erased/destroyed. 
5 INTERVENTION  
5.1 Palliative Care Encounter Intervention (STANDARD OF CARE)  
Subjects will receive usual care plus a SNF-PC Encounter (intervention) by [CONTACT_270848]-based PC focused training that includes ADRD/CI components. 
The goal of the intervention, the SNF-PC Encounter, is to evaluate illness understanding, symptom 
assessment and management, goals of care conversations, documentation, communication, and 
implementation recommendations. While the intervention is not specifically designed f or patients 
diagnosed with ADRD/CI, all components are consistent with appropriate care for persons with 
cognitive impairment and their LAR/surrogate decision maker and include some ADRD/CI specific 
components. The intervention will be administered by [CONTACT_270849]-PC Encounter.  
 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_330229] notification will be utilized to infor m all newly admitted 
patients at each study site of their participation in this trial. During the admission process , 
potential subjects will be provided with a 1-page summary sheet (Broadcast notification) detaili ng 
their participation in this study that will include contact [CONTACT_270850] y team, should the 
subject or their LAR/surrogate decision maker elect to opt-out of participating. Baseline d ata will 
be collected virtually via telephone by [CONTACT_270851] (POSv2), the Satisfaction with Care at the End of Lif e in 
Dementia (SWC-EOLD), and the Symptom Management at the End of Life in Dementia (SM-
EOLD).  
 
Between 14 days and 21 days after the baseline POSv2, SWC-EOLD, and the SM-EOLD are 
administered, all subjects will be asked to complete the POSv2, SWC-EOLD, and the SM-EOLD 
again virtually via telephone. The POSv2, SWC-EOLD, and the SM-EOLD will be given a total 
of two times to those in the INTERVENTION and CONTROL groups (at baseline and follow up 
(14-21 days later)).  
 
Deidentified subject demographics will be collected on all participants in the following way:  
Study team members will review subject's medical records and enter de-identified data int o a 
Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database (Acts staff assists with the study team’s  
access to subject's medical record).  
 
The goal of the intervention is to prevent, identify and treat symptoms early during SNF care, 
establish goal directed treatment decisions, and support the patient and family in decision ma king. 
We anticipate that many Palliative Care encounters involve a single encounter with the patient 
and/or LAR/surrogate decision maker, but we have made allowances for follow up visits 
depending on individual patient and family needs (e.g., symptom management, continuing goals 
of care discussions). We will use usual care as the control condition. Usual care consists of 
traditional resources focused on skilled nursing care without services to support specialty 
palliative care. A usual care comparison will test whether the Palliative Care Encounter improves 
patient/family reported outcomes compared to traditional services. We have chosen to not use an 
attention control condition because the goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_270833] f easibility and 
determine the effect size of the intervention on the primary outcome.  
Version 1.[ADDRESS_330230] measures via phone or through a secured online template to 
minimize missing data at two time points (baseline and 14-21 days later) during the study. A ll 
data will be entered and managed in REDCap by [CONTACT_21118], project manager, or the PI.  
 
Patient/Caregiver Quality of Life: Measured at baseline and follow-up (14-21 days later ), the 
Palliative Outcomes Scale version 2 (POSv2) is a 12-item survey that measures quality of l ife in 
five dimensions: 1) physical; 2) emotional; 3) psychological; 4) spi[INVESTIGATOR_153418], and 5) provi sion 
of information and support. (RESEARCH PROCEDURE)  
 
Satisfaction With Care at the End of Life in Dementia (SWC-EOLD): Measured at baseline and 
follow-up (14-21 days later), the SWC-EOLD is a validated, 10-item scale that measures 
satisfaction with care for PLWD. Each item is measured on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from  1 
(<strongly disagree=) to 4 (<strongly agree= ) and uses a <prior 90 days= timeframe. Specific 
elements include satisfaction with medical and nursing care, decision-making, and their 
understanding of illness. All items are summed, yielding a range of scores of 10-40. Higher 
scores indicate greater satisfaction. (RESEARCH PROCEDURE) 
 
Symptom Management at the End of Life in Dementia (SM-EOLD): Measured at baseline and 
follow-up (14-21 days later), the SM-EOLD is a valid and reliable 9-item scale that measures 
PLWD physical and psychological symptoms over the previous 90 days. Each item is rated on a 
6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 5 (0 = <daily=, 1  = <several days a week=, 2  = <once per 
week=, 3  = <2 or 3 days a month=, 4  = <once a month=,  5 = <never=). Scores are summed and 
range from 0 to 45 (higher scores indicate better symptom management). (RESEARCH 
PROCEDURE) 
 
Palliative Care Encounter: Trained provider will discuss illness trajectories, establish , and 
communicate patient-directed goals that guide health care decisions, identify and treat illnes s-
related symptoms, and identify psycho-spi[INVESTIGATOR_270834].

6.[ADDRESS_330231] admissions paperwork (this provides a way for the patient or their legally authorized 
representative to receive a written statement of the research). The use of the broadcast st udy 
notification as well as the proposed broadcast study notification statement/flyer (includ ed in this 
submission) has been approved by [CONTACT_270847] (the participating nursing home). The broadcast 
notification will serve both as an advertisement and information sheet.  
 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_330232] potential participants (eligi ble patients or the 
LAR/surrogate decision makers of eligible patients) by [CONTACT_270852]. 
The study team members will read the broadcast study notification to all subjects with t he option 
to opt out.  
 
Study team members can confirm that the individual is the LAR because we have been given the 
contact [CONTACT_270853] a designated Acts staff member who is involved in the resident’s 
admission and overall care. The study team member asks the designated person at Acts if the 
resident can make their own decisions.  
6.3 Data Collection 
Baseline data will be collected virtually via telephone by [CONTACT_270854]/surrogate to complete the Patient Outcomes Scale (POSv2) as well as two ADRD 
specific evaluations: the Satisfaction with Care at the End of Life in Dementia (SWC-EO LD) and 
the Symptom Management at the End of Life in Dementia (SM-EOLD).  
 
Follow-up visit data will be collected virtually via telephone as well. The patient or 
surrogate/LAR will complete the POSv2, SWC-EOLD, and SM-EOLD 14-[ADDRESS_330233] baseline 
measures.  
6.4 Measures and Instruments 
To establish feasibility, benchmarks for success will be measured. To measure quality of l ife, the 
Palliative Outcomes Scale (POSv2) will be used. To assess care satisfaction and symptom 
management, the Satisfaction with Care at the End of Life in Dementia (SWC-EOLD) and the 
Symptom Management at the End of Life in Dementia (SM-EOLD) surveys will be used.

with dementia. Each item is measured on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 
(<strongly disagree=) to 4 (<strongly agree=). Specific elements include 
satisfaction with medical and nursing care, decision-making, and their 
understanding of the persons with dementia illness. All items are summed, 
yielding a range of scores of 10-40. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction. 
 
Symptom Management at the End of Life in Dementia (SM-EOLD): A valid 
and reliable 9 item scale administered to a caregiver that measures persons with 
dementia physical and psychological symptoms. Each item is rated on a 6-point 
Likert scale ranging from 0 to 5 (0 = <daily=, 1  = <several days a week=, 2  = <once

are summed and range from [ADDRESS_330235] practices for palliative care in the nur sing home 
setting. We do not anticipate any adverse reactions to the intervention and therefor e minimal risks to 
participants is expected. For Acts staff participating in the palliative care encounter training there is 
no risk. Adverse events (AEs) are defined as <unanticipated problems= involving r isks to study 
participants or others (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not 99-107.html). AEs will be 
identified by [CONTACT_270856]-report, routine study assessm ents, or through 
interactions with participants or SNF nursing home staff.  Because this proposal involves an evidence-
based palliative care intervention provided by [CONTACT_270857], no ser ious 
adverse events are expected to occur. However, the following may occur and expected in persons 
with serious illness:   
 
• Death, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Change in clinical status 
 
Adverse Event (AE):  AE is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study 
participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the r esearch, 
whether or not considered related to participation in the research.   
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  SAEs consist of any adverse event that results in death; is life 
threatening or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred ; 
Version 1.0  12 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; causes persistent or significant disability or inca pacity; results 
in congenital anomalies or birth defects; is another condition which investigators judge to re present 
significant hazards  
Any SAE will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible but no later than 5 calendar days. If AEs 
or SAEs are identified or reported, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_270835] (within 48 hours) ad hoc 
meeting with the study team. During this meeting, we will determine the relevance and si gnificance 
of the AE to the study, including an aggregate analysis of other occurrences of the same (or similar ) 
event. Then we will determine if the AE can be determined to be an anticipated or unanticipated 
problem (evaluate whether or not the event would have likely happened regardless of participation  
in the study) involving risk to human subjects or a serious adverse event and determine what, if any, 
follow- up is needed with the participant/family surrogate, participant’s primary care team, and the 
nursing facility leadership and staff. AEs will be monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_270858]/or the project manager. A listing of AEs and their attribution (e.g., level of pr obability 
of being study related, intervention related, or unrelated to study or treatment) will be recor ded and 
reviewed with each AE.

 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues  
N/A 
9.[ADDRESS_330237]-acute Skilled Nursing Facility ( SNF) 
Palliative Care (PC) intervention for patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementi as 
(ADRD) and cognitive impairment (CI). Following guidelines on sample size selection for  pi[INVESTIGATOR_270837] (widths of confidence intervals [CIs]) of our 
estimates of feasibility to assess sample size. With 25 participants per group, 90% CI s for 
proportions will be ± 10-16% for within-group proportions between 10-90%, which is sufficient  
precision for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_270838] a wide range of possible outcomes. Another primary outcome of the 
study is to estimate effect sizes for the SNF-PC intervention on patient/family caregive r reported 
satisfaction with care, symptom management, and quality of life. Based on our current experience 
in the parent study, we anticipate up to 10% of participants will not have outcomes available ( e.g., 
missing data or dropout).  
 
Based on prior results and a conservative assumption of a modest correlation (r = 0.3) between pre-  
and post-intervention values, we estimate the corresponding standard deviation (SD) of pre-post 
changes of the Satisfaction with Care at the End of Life in Dementia (SWC-EOLD) scale to be 4.9 
units.  With 25 participants enrolled per group (22 with complete data), we will have 80% power to 
detect a change in SWC-EOLD within the intervention group of 2.7 scale units at a two-sided 
significance level of α = 0.1 , which corresponds to a clinically significant change. The precision of 
the mean changes in SWC-EOLD within group and between groups (90% CIs) would be ± 1.0 and 
± 2.5 scale units, respectively. Lastly, with this sample size, the upper bound of the one-sided 90% 
CI for the SD of each endpoint will be only 17% higher than the point estimate, so there will be 
limited sample size inflation needed when powering a follow up study based on the SD estimates 
from the proposed study 
 
This is a non-randomized pragmatic clinical trial.  
9.[ADDRESS_330238] /CI using 
established benchmarks based on published recommendations for evaluating pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]. We will 
track the number of eligible patients, monitor follow-up, document rates of eligibility, en rollment, 
and completion of the intervention, and collect the outcome measures with <5% missing data. We 
will determine clinician fidelity to the SNF-PC protocol  
We also will estimate the effect size of the SNF-PC intervention on pre-post changes in th e POSv2, 
SWC-EOLD, and the SM-EOLD relative to the control group. These estimates will be summarized 
with two-sided 90% Confidence Intervals and p-values corresponding to tests against the null 
hypothesis of no (zero) difference.  
We also will examine the demographics, clinical characteristics, and palliative care needs of  people 
with ADRD/CI versus non ADRD/CI serious illnesses during post-acute SNF care. As the 
Version 1.0  14 
 comparisons will be made using baseline/pre-intervention information, all [ADDRESS_330239] changes in the POS v2 between the 
intervention and control arms. Linear regression models will be used to compare the two groups. 
The within-arm changes and differences between arms will be summarized with two-sided 90 % CIs 
and p- values corresponding to tests against the null hypothesis of no (zero) change or difference. 
We will also explore subgroup effects of the intervention on endpoints by [CONTACT_270859], age, and race.  
 
Other key parameters needed to plan a follow-up study will be estimated as well, including the 
standard deviation (SD) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of each endpoint. The IC C 
summarizes the degree of correlation of values among patients within a site, which is an import ant 
parameter when planning a future cluster randomized controlled trial.  
10 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
10.1 Data Collection/Management  
Study data will be entered and managed using REDCap (http://www.project-redcap.org) which is a 
secure, web-based application. The University of Maryland is a member of the REDCap consortium, 
and this application is freely available to consortium members. REDCap provides: 1) an int uitive 
interface for data entry (with data validation), 2) audit trails for tracking data ent ry and changes, 3) 
automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages, 4) 
procedures for importing data from external sources, and 5) advanced features, such as branching 
logic and calculated fields.  
 
10.2 Quality Assurance  
10.2.1 Training 
To maximize quality control, the study team will be trained in all data collection and 
entry procedures. A designated study team member will monitor data collection by 
[CONTACT_270860].  
10.2.2  Metrics 
The study team will utilize double-data entry methods on a 10% random sample, with 
checks for discordant errors, and as data are entered into the REDCap system. 
10.2.3 Protocol Deviation 
Protocol deviations will be captured, documented, and reviewed by a member of the 
study team during interaction with Acts staff and/or participants/LARs. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_270839] a modification to the protocol is needed.  
[ADDRESS_330240] the site will be identified only by a participant 
identification number (Participant ID, PID) and stored in secure computer files and locked fi ling 
cabinets to maintain confidentiality. All computer entry and networking programs will be done 
using PI[INVESTIGATOR_34107]. Information will not be released without written permission of the participant , 
except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, the NIA, and the OHRP. The study team 
will destroy the records at the earliest opportunity following data analysis and study completi on.

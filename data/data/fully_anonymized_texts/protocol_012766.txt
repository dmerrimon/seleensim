HER-[ADDRESS_805071] dramatic impacts in eliminating these primary 
tumors 23. However, there is also evidence of the molecules being involved in resistance to  treatments  
24. Patients with locally advanced HER -2/neu and triple -negative cancers are at sign ificant risk of 
systemic recurrence, especially when complete pathologic response is not obtained with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy. We believe that targeting these pathways with a cellular immune response  
(particularly CD4 T cells) may prevent or eliminate d ormant tumor cells remaining after therapy. Our 
preliminary data outlined below highlights an opportunity to potentially increase complete responses 
and help prevent recurrence in these patients with significant risk of systemic failure following 
standard therapy. Dendritic cell cancer vaccines combined with chemotherapy may increase complete 
responses giving breast cancer specific immune cells greater opportunity to function while the  
immune  repertoire  is  being  shifted  by [CONTACT_607592] -breast  cancer  response  and  offer  the 
chance to test secondary prevention of breast cancer in high risk settings. There is a need to determine 
whether this ICAIT DC1 can activate CD4 and CD8 T cells prior to or in combination with 
chemotherapy with or without  added trastuzumab. This would be a tremendous opportunity to  
improve outcomes for these high risk  patients.

Experience with the vaccine to prevent recurrence: DC1 induces durable Th1 -polarized anti - 
HER-[ADDRESS_805073] HER- 
2/neu over -expressing early breast cancer (Ductal carcinoma in situ -DCIS) or DCIS with

Subjects diagnosed with HER -2/neupos DCIS were vaccinated four times at weekly intervals prior to 
scheduled surgical resection of the tumor. The vaccines consisted of HER -[ADDRESS_805074] (LPS), 
resulting in high-level IL-12 and Th1 chemokine secretion ( DC1). The peptides used to pulse ICAIT 
DC consisted of 6 HLA class II promiscuous binders, as well as two HLA class I binding peptides (for 
HLA-A2.1pos subjects). A summary of trial results is shown in the  composite Figure [ADDRESS_805075] -vaccine surgical 
specimen showed that vaccination induced heavy influx of CD4pos helper-T cells around DCIS (Fig. 
1A), as well as CD8pos CTL and C D20 B cell (not shown). Immunohistochemical staining of HER - 
2/neu expression by [CONTACT_607593] -vaccine biopsy (“PRE”) compared with the post -vaccine surgical 
specimen (“POST”) indicated marked reduction of HER -2 expression in half of the subjects (Fig. 1 B). 
The left panels of “B” show photo microscopy of stained DCIS sections from one representative 
subject (note loss of brown HER -2 staining in “POST” specimen) while the right panels show 
composite data of HER -2 reductions from 8 sample subjects as well a s unvaccinated controls. No  such 
reductions were observed in an unvaccinated contemporaneous control group (Fig. 1B) suggesting  
that vaccination could eliminate HER -2-overexpressing tumor cells. A comparison of estimated tumor 
size determined radiographic ally prior to vaccination with the actual tumor removed during surgery 
indicated reductions in the area of disease for about half of the subjects, with results for five of these 
clinically-responsive individuals shown (Fig. 1C). In fact, five of [ADDRESS_805076] are shown (Fig.1D). This is important since CD4pos and CD8pos T  cell  
infiltration in IBC is associated with long -term survival.  The immunity generated by [CONTACT_607594][INVESTIGATOR_42751] I HER -[ADDRESS_805077] Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/[ADDRESS_805078] -vaccination. All subjects showed long -term CD4 T cell 
immunity to vaccine pep tides by [CONTACT_34536]. Anti -peptide results for subjects 1, 2 and 6 (taken 48, 48 
and 43 month’s post -vaccination, respectively) without prior stimulation are shown (Fig. 1E). Note 
that the long -term recall responses to vaccine peptides are often superior in ma gnitude to the recall 
response against tetanus toxoid. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_607568], we nonetheless demonstrated in some patients’ sera a vaccine -induced increase in 
complement -dependent lysis of HER -2/neupos tumor lines in vitro (Fig. 1F), a property not seen with 
trastuzumab. Although antibody titers appeared fairly low (not shown), these data provide strong 
encouragement that antibody responses are present and ripe for dramatic improvement. Of utmost  
importance in this completed trial and a second follow -on trial now in progress is that we have a 
composite complete pathologic response rate of about 35% in ERneg HER-2pos (i.e. hormone - 
independent) DCIS patients compared with 4% for ERpos HER-2neg (Fig. 1G). Since pathologic CR in 
breast cancer is associated with decreased risk of recurrence and deaths, it is not surprising that we 
have observed no breast cancer events in the patients that are ERneg HER-2pos compared to the group 
that is ERpos HER-2pos (Fig. 1G) we are highly confident that this Th1 -polarizing DC vaccine will be 
associated with diminished secondary recurrence of DCIS and IBC. We wish to determine whether 
these vaccines following chemotherapy can induce immune responses and ultimately d ecrease 
recurrence in high risk node positive patients.  
 
Clinical experience with DC1 vaccines : The vaccines are readily produced from all [ADDRESS_805079] cancer. There is abundant IL -12 production. There is 85 -90% induction of 
CD4 and CD8 T cells that recognize HER -[ADDRESS_805080] vaccination. None of these patients had immediately 
had chemotherapy or trastuzumab. The side effects of vaccine included grade 1 and 2 fevers, chills, 
fatigue, injection site soreness, headache. There were <10%  of patients with asymptomatic declines in 
MUGA scan all within normal range above 50%. There was no one that developed heart failure 
clinically or by [CONTACT_607595]. Any grade [ADDRESS_805081] 
cancer: The majority of DCIS patients even prior to vaccination have evidence of  CD4 T cells that 
secrete INF -γ when stimulated with extracellular domain (ECD) HER -1 (Fig 2 left graph). Those 
patients that do not have anti -HER-[ADDRESS_805082] HER -2 (Fig 2 right graph). There were only a few patients with evidence of HER -3 CD4 T  
cell responses prior to vaccination but the majority developed suggestion of weak CD4 T cell 
responses beginning after vaccination (Fig 3). These data support that following HER -[ADDRESS_805083] Cancer

6.1 Preparation of the  vaccine 
 
Preparation of the vaccine is a multi -step process starting with leukapheresis and countercurrent 
centrifugal elutriation to obtain the relevant monocyte pool. This monocyte pool will then be 
treated with GM -CSF then pulsed with HER -2/neu peptides and finally matured with INF -, and 
LPS for conversion into type 1 dendritic cells (DC1). When occurring at University of 
Pennsylvania a  study monitor will oversee quality assurance of vaccine production.  When 
occurring at Moffitt Cancer Center, all standard in stitutional quality assurance policies will be 
followed.

Version v2  03/01/2017  15  
 placed by [CONTACT_607597].   At the time of    
the apheresiscollection, a tube of serum will be drawn and tested for a baseline  anti -HER-2/neu 
response.  This will then be compared with a specimen of serum that will be taken and tested 
post vaccine.  
 
For subjects in whom leukapheresis did not yield sufficient number of cells to make all 6 
vaccines and 3 booster vaccines (1.8x10^9 monoc ytes), an additional apheresis collection will be 
undertaken to yield enough cells to manufacturer the remaining vaccines.  . 
 
Subjects may additionally undergo leukapheresis (15 -20 liters) at the completion of the first [ADDRESS_805091] 5mL of peripheral blood drawn at multiple time points during the vaccine 
schedule (pre vaccine, post six vaccines, pre booster 1, pre booster 2, pre booster 3, and 
completion of all vaccinations) to monitor immunologic responses to the administered vaccines. 
Subjects will also have the option to undergo additional leukapheresis (10 -15 liters) at the 
completion of the [ADDRESS_805092] Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/[ADDRESS_805093] to countercurrent centrifugal elutriation on a Model J -6M centrifuge (Beckman 
Instruments) equipped with a JE -5.0 elutriation rotor operating at 1725g and 20oC) or equivalent 
apparatus. The apheresis product is loaded onto the elutriator at 1 20cc/minute flow rate, then 
fractions are collected using stepwise increases in flow rates to obtain lymphocyte -rich (120  and  
140 cc/minute), transitional (150 cc/minute) and monocyte -rich (180 and 190 cc/minute) 
fractions. A final monocyte -rich fraction is collected at zero rpm (rotor off). Lymphocyte - rich 
fractions are then further purified with density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll -Hypaque to 
remove the red blood cells.  
 
The monocyte fraction is washed, counted and aliquoted out into portions fo r individual 
vaccines and cryopreserved for use at a later date.

Monocytes will be washed 2 times in Hanks Buffer. Monocytes will be cultured with GM -CSF, 
IL-4, IFN-, and LPS for conversion into DC1. Monocytes at concentrations of 3x106 cells/ml 
will be cultured in serum free medium (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) with 50 ng/ml (250 
IU/ml) rhGM -CSF, and IL -4 1000 u/ml (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 20 ug/ml HER- 
2/neu peptides will be added to the culture on the morning of day 2. If, after thawing the 
cryopreserved cells, there is less than 85% cell viability, the exact number of cells needed for 
vaccine production will be cultured for one extra day in rhGM -CSF and vaccine administration 
will be moved back one day. Recombinant HER -2/neu peptides 3 ECD p42-56

(PAREIPDLLEKGERL)  and  p1166 -1180  (TLERPKTLSPGKNGV)  (American  Peptide    Co, 
Sunnyvale, CA) will be pulsed on day 2. The peptides will be pulsed in separate wells 2 -3 wells 
per peptide to avoid competition for binding in the MHC. The evening of day 2 IFN - (1000 
u/ml) will be adde d. Six – eighteen hours later LPS (10 ng/ml) will be added and the cells 
cultured an additional 2 -8 hours. For HLA -A2+ subjects, one hour prior to harvest, pulse DC1 in 
addition to above with 50ug/ml of HER -2/neu class I binding peptides into one well of e ach ECD 
and ICD with two different peptides (369 -377, 689-697). For HLA -A3+ subjects, one hour prior 
to harvest, pulse DC1 in addition to above with 50ug/ml of HER -2/neu class I binding peptide 
into one well of each ECD and ICD with one peptide (369 -377). In the event that HLA -A tissue 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_607570] -A2 peptide addition, will have 
the peptides added to the culture under the principle that if said patient is not HLA -A2+ or HLA - 
A3+ the peptides will not be abl e to bind properly and be washed away during the harvest of the 
vaccine.  The cells will then be harvested from the plates, washed three times with Hanks  
Buffer, counted and pooled. Viability will be determined by [CONTACT_132422].   About [ADDRESS_805096]’s name, dat e and time prior to release. The vaccine will be

Version v2  03/01/[ADDRESS_805099] Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/[ADDRESS_805100] will be 
performed according to Good Laboratory Practices in the CVPF. The results of endotoxin 
testing and microbiology cultures will be checked when available and if not meeting 
specifications the vaccine will be discarded. An endotoxin level of less than 5 EU/kg body 
weight will be accepte d. Sterility testing will be performed in accordance with CFR 610.12 and 
a specification of no growth will be required. A final quality analysis certificate will be issued for 
each dose of vaccine administered. (Appendix B). Additionally, cell viability of  the prepared 
vaccine will be determined using trypan blue staining. The results will be available prior to 
vaccine administration. Cell viability of >70% will be required for release of vaccine. If this 
cutoff is not met, then the vaccine will be re -made. In addition, a sample of each vaccine will 
also be removed for FACS analysis of cell surface markers to confirm conversion of monocytes 
to DC. Since the activity of the vaccine does not depend on phenotype the vaccine will not be 
held for phenotype but wi ll serve as an internal evaluation of the process of vaccine preparation 
(see below).  
The requirements for vaccine release then  are: 
Viability >70% 
gram stain result no organisms  
endotoxin test  <5EU/kg subject weight 
culture and sensitivity  no growth final  culture 
 
Since the culture test will become available after vaccine administration the following 
contingency plan will be in place for a positive culture:  
 Notification of both the primary attending physician and the  subject. 
 Identification of the responsi ble microorganism and sensitivity  testing. 
 A description of additional subject monitoring as required by [CONTACT_607599]. 
 Initiate an investigation of the event and take corrective actions to prevent future 
recurrences. The scope of the investigation and proposed corrections should  include: 
o Evaluation of your current procedures for collecting and processing the 
autologous peripheral blood product to determine the step at which contamination 
could be introduced.  
o Development of  changes in the procedures that will assist in preventing sterility 
lapses in the  future. 
o Development of appropriate testing to ensure that revised changes to the 
procedures produce a sterile product. This should include sterility testing at 
various points  in the preparation of the  product. 
 Report the incident as an adverse event to the agency within [ADDRESS_805101] Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/[ADDRESS_805102] ELISA. We utilize ELISA reagents purchased from Pharmigen 
according to the m anufacturer’s recommendation to measure secreted  IL-12. 
 
Table 1: Preparation of Dendritic Cell Vaccines: Summary of Procedure   
1. Suspend monocytes in serum free medium (SFM) to concentration of 3x106cells/ml. Plate 1cc 
of cell suspension/well in 64 well plate for a total of 12 -18 wells (60-80 at Moffitt) . Cells plated 
in numbers higher than actual dose to compensate for 50 -75% retrieval rate with  harvesting.  
 
2. If monocytes cryopreserved, thaw, add 20 cc Hanks Buffer and spin at 1200 rpm for 5 
minutes at 220C. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_607571] 10 cc medium.  Remove 20 µl for 
cell count. Use trypan blue to exclude dead cells from cell count.  Add 10 cc Hanks Buffer and 
spin again at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at 220C. Resuspend to concentration of 3x 106 cells/ml in 
SFM and plate as above.   
 
 
3. Add rhGM -CSF for final concentration of 50 ng/ml or 250 IU/ml and IL -4 1000 u/ml (see IV 
Preparation of Reagents). Culture overnight.  If, after thawing the cryopreserved cells, there is 
less than 85% cell viability, the exact number of cells needed for vaccine production will be 
cultured for one extra day in rhGM -CSF and vaccine administration will be moved back one  day. 
 
4. The next morning, add HER -2/neu peptides for a final concentration of of 20µg/ml [ADDRESS_805103] Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/2017  21  
  
5. In the afternoon, add IFN - 1000 u/ml, culture cells at 37o C and 5% CO2 overnight for 14 hours.  
 
6. The following morning, add LPS (10 ng/ml)  
 
7. Incubate 2-8 hours. 
 
8. For HLA-A2+ subjects, one hour prior to harvest, pulse DC1 in addition to above with 50 ug/ml 
HER-2/neu class I binding peptides into one well of each ECD and ICD with two different peptides 
(369-377 and 689 -697). For  HLA -A3+ subjects, one hour prior to harvest, pulse DC1 in addition to 
above with 50ug/ml of HER -2/neu class I binding peptide into one well of each ECD and ICD with 
one peptide (369 -377).  In the event that HLA -A tissue typi[INVESTIGATOR_607572] -A2 peptide addition, will have the peptides added to the culture under the principle 
that if said patient is not HLA -A2+ or HLA -A3+ the peptides will not be able to bind properly and 
be washed awa y during the harvest of the vaccine.       
 
9. Harvest cells into 50cc Falcon tubes.  Maximum 20 cc cell volume and add 20 cc Hanks Buffer 
and spin at 1200 rpm for 5 minute @ 220C. Repeat this step, wash the cells again.  
 
10. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_607573]. Remove 20 µl for cell count to estimate % cell death. Pool 2 -2.5 million 
cells per each peptide and respin cells at 1200 rpm, 220C for 5 minutes.  Resuspend in 20cc sterile 
saline.  Remove 12 -18 million cells, about 15cc, for vaccine preparation and from the 5cc rem aining 
the tests of endotoxin, sterility testing, gram stain and FACS (see 6.5.4 Phenotypic Analysis of DC1 ) 
will be obtained.   The vaccine component will be centrifuged and resuspended to 1cc with a total 
cell number 1.0-2.0 x 107 cells.  
 
11. Label with subjects name, date  and time. Release for administration if cell viability >70% and 
gram stain no organisms seen Endotoxin testing must be less than 5 EU/kg body mass for 
administration.  At University of Pennsylvania, some of the tested material will be r eserved so that, 
in the event a contaminant is discovered in the process of sterility testing, we will have individual 
components to test so to determine the exact point of contamination.  
 
12. Remake the vaccine if cell viability <70%, positive gram stain,  or endotoxin level >5EU/kg. At 
Moffitt the vial will be removed from liquid nitrogen and allowed to thaw at room temperature.  
Once vial is fully thawed the vaccine will be removed from the vial and transferred into a syringe for 
injection.  The vaccine w ill be kept at a cool temperature, around 4 degrees C, until administration

D. Vaccine Schedule 
 
The vaccine schedule is meant to be weekly; however the first [ADDRESS_805110] not demonstrated serious toxicities and we 
anticipate that subjects on this protocol will also tolerate vaccination without incident. 
Specifically, our own HER -2/neu peptide pulsed DC1 protocol using this same regimen has been 
well tolerated. We have therefore designed this vaccination trial as a largely out -patient based 
protocol. However, should significant toxicities be noted this tri al as a result of the additional 
breast vaccinations, the trial will be amended to increase the period of patient observation 
accordingly.

6.7 Toxicity and Adverse Event  Reporting  
 
A. General Toxicity  
 
The HER -2/neu protein is expressed by [CONTACT_45092][INVESTIGATOR_607586], skin, 
gastrointestinal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], reproductive and urinary tissues. The HER -2/neu gene is not over - 
amplified in these normal cells and a level of protein expression is thus expected to be 
significantly lower than the gene over -amplification and protein over -expression seen in DCIS. 
In animal models of successful immunity to HER -2/neu protein using HER -2/neu ECD and ICD 
peptides, no evidence of autoimmunity has been noted. Additionally, in DC trials of melanoma 
and prostate, no cl inical evidence of autoimmunity directed against normal tissues sharing the 
targeted tumor antigen has been discovered. Therefore, although the risk is presumed to be 
minimal, the possibility of autoimmune disease directed at these normal tissues cannot be  
entirely excluded.  
 
This vaccine has not been previously administered to individuals who have been treated with 
Herceptin. Recent trials of Herceptin, the monoclonal antibody therapy to HER -2/neu ECD, have 
noted approximately 5% risk of cardiac toxicity l eading to heart failure. The mechanism appears 
to be related to presence of HER -2/neu on cardiac cells. The levels of HER -2/neu expression by 
[CONTACT_607603], however, are extremely low, detectable only by [CONTACT_79435].  
 
Subjects on this trial will have c ardiac evaluation of MUGA or echocardiogram to determine 
their ejection fraction. Subjects will also be closely monitored for signs/symptoms of heart 
failure. In our first trial there was no evidence of clinically relevant cardiac failure. Less than 8% 
of subjects had asymptomatic declines in ejection fractions post -vaccine, thought all EFs were 
still within normal range. There have been no long term cardiac toxicities noted as a result of this 
vaccine. Additionally, Herceptin does not cause long term cardi ac toxicity issues. We do not 
expect the cardiac toxicity of prior Herceptin treatment and treatment with the vaccine to be 
additive. 
 
It has been demonstrated that fetuses express HER -2/neu during the third trimester and there is 
the possibility of spontaneous abortion as a result of anti -HER-2/neu T cell responses against the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_42751] I HER -[ADDRESS_805143] Cancer

B. Toxicity Definitions  
 
Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI -CTCAE version 4.02  
 
C. Toxicity Definition for  Leukapheresis  
 
Grade 1: Requirement for oral calcium supplementation either during or just after procedure. 
Severe bruising requiring treatment such as warm compresses or anti -inflammatory medication 
for a brief 1 week duration.  
 
Grade 2: Prolonged requirement for calcium administration greater than 24 hours, infection at 
the intravenous site requirin g treatment or intervention with antibiotics or surgery.  
 
Grade 3: Alteration in vital signs such as severe hypotension requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_607587].  
 
D. Dose Limiting Toxicity  (DLT) 
 
Since the agent being administered is a biologic agent prepared from the subjects own cells as 
opposed to a single drug we will lump the toxicity together as that caused by [CONTACT_607604]. A subject that develops any grade 3 or greater toxicity per the 
NIH Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Toxicity Criteria version 4. 03 except for 
fever greater than 40oC for <12 hours will be taken off protocol.  A continuous monitoring rule 
for 
dose-limiting toxicity will be followed during the trial, as described in sectio n 6.11 Statistical 
Considerations.  
 
Grade 2 allergic reaction: generalized urticaria 
Greater than or equal Grade 3 allergic reaction 
Greater than or equal Grade 2 autoimmune reaction 
Greater than or equal Grade 3 cardiac toxicity  
Any Greater than or equal Grade 3 hematologic and non -hematologic toxicity.

6.8 Immunologic  Testing 
 
To ascertain the immunologic efficacy of the prepared vaccines, several parameters will be 
investigated at the initiation and then again at the conclusion of the four vaccine regimen. These 
include in vitro sensitization assays to determine the development of HER -2/neu CD4+ and CD8+ 
T  cell  precursors.    For  each  subject,  immunologic  evaluations  on  pre  and  post vaccination  
samples will be conducted simultaneously to minimize discrepancies in technique and culture 
conditions.  
 
To assess the in vivo immunologic effects of our DC vaccine, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells will be 
assessed before and after the vaccine protocol for qualitative evidence of HER -2/neu 
sensitization.   In addition T cells from the sentinel node will be tested post vaccinat ion.   If   this

Administration of HER -2/neu pulsed DC may result in several potential complications. First the 
administration of activated DC may cause transient hypotension from release of cytokines. This 
is a theoretic possibility and has not been observed in mouse models or human trials 
administering DC alone without IL -2 or other cytokines. The second possible complication 
includes the induction of autoimmune reactions to normal epi[INVESTIGATOR_607588] - 
2/neu antigen. However,  in animal models of successful immunity to HER -2/neu protein using 
HER-2/neu ECD and ICD peptides, no evidence of autoimmunity has been noted. Additionally, 
in DC trials of melanoma and prostate, no clinical evidence of severe autoimmunity directed 
against normal tissues sharing the targeted tumor antigen has been discovered. To date, in our 
own trial using peptide pulsed DC1s for vaccination in subjects with DCIS, the protocol has been 
well tolerated with toxicities of grade 1 fever, chills, headache, fat igue, and injection site 
tenderness.  
 
Recent data from studies of Herceptin, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER -2/neu, have 
reported a small incidence of cardiomyopathy likely related to low level expression of HER - 
2/neu on cardiac cells. The risk of this complication is estimated at 5%. This toxicity is a result 
of an antibody and it is anticipated that with low level expression that T cells will be able to 
discriminate against the heart. In addition since the heart cells are MHC class II negative CD4 + 
T cells would not interact with these cardiac cells.  
 
This vaccine has not been previously administered to individuals who have been treated with 
Herceptin. Subjects on this trial will have cardiac evaluation of MUGA or echocardiogram to 
determine their ejection fraction. Subjects will also be closely monitored for signs/symptoms of 
heart failure. In our first trial there was no evidence of clinically relevant cardiac failure. Less 
than 8% of subjects had asymptomatic declines in ejection fractions post -vaccine, thought all 
EFs were still within normal range. There have been no long term cardiac toxicities noted as a 
result of this vaccine. Additionally, Herceptin does not cause long term cardiac toxicity issues. 
We do not expect the cardiac toxicity of pr ior Herceptin treatment and treatment with the vaccine 
to be additive. 
 
It has been demonstrated that fetuses express HER -2/neu during the third trimester and there is 
the possibility of spontaneous abortion as a result of anti -HER-2/neu T cell responses a gainst the 
fetus.  Therefore women of childbearing years will be made aware of this possibility.  
 
8.0 Consent Procedure  
 
The nature of the study and the procedures to be performed will be reviewed with the subjects by 
[CONTACT_079]  [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee. The subjects will be given ample time to ask 
questions and decide on participation in the study. A consent form will be signed and kept in the 
research file and a copy on the patient’s chart. Any patient given vaccine or boost at Moffitt will 
be re-consented using Moffitt Cancer Center consent form.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_805149]’s chart will 
document participation in the study with the protocol name [CONTACT_114040].  Under no circumstance  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_42751] I HER -[ADDRESS_805150] Cancer  
Version v2  03/01/[ADDRESS_805151] significant risk of systemic recurrence and targeting HER -2/neu may 
reduce the risk of subsequent recurrence and if this study is safe and generates immune responses 
would lead to additional trials to test for reducing recurrence.  
 
11.0 Exceptions an d Deviations  
 
 
There will be no exceptions to eligibility, contraindicated treatment/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/interventions or safety 
tests. 
 
An exception is a one time, intentional action or process that departs from the IRB and CTSRMC 
approved study protocol, intended for one occurrence. If the action disrupts the study progress, such 
that the study design or outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the action compromises the 
safety and welfare of study subjects, advance documented approval will be requested from the IRB, 
DSMC, Moffitt Cancer Center PMC and Safety Monitoring Committee.  
 
A deviation is a one time, unintentional action or process that departs from the IRB and DSMC 
approved study protocol, involving one incident and identified retrospectively, after the e vent 
occurred. If the impact on the protocol disrupts the study design, may affect the outcome (endpoints) 
or compromises the safety and welfare of the subjects, the deviation will be reported to the DSMC 
and Safety Monitoring Committee within 5 business d ays and to the IRB within 10 business days.  
 
 
12.0 Risk/Benefit Ratio  
 
In breast cancer, there remain a significant proportion of subjects who will not benefit from the 
current adjuvant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_607589]. Immunotherapy offers a new 
approach to adjuvant therapy and one that may even be applied in prevention of breast cancer. 
Therefore, the immunologic information gathered from studies such as this one have the  
potential to impact large numbers of subjects with breast cancer or at  high risk for breast cancer. 
The recent DC trials for melanoma and prostate have demonstrated that such vaccines can be 
administered safely without adverse effects. Therefore, with minimal risk to the  subjects  
enrolled in this study, information will be  gathered that can determine the feasibility of a whole 
new approach for breast cancer  care.

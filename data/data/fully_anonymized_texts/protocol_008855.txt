[COMPANY_005] Development Center Americas, Inc.Compound:
Soticlestat (also known as TAK -935)
Title of Protocol: A Multicenter, Randomized, 
Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Parallel Group Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Soticlestat 
as Adjunctive Therapy in Pediatric and Adult Subjects With 
Lennox -Gastaut Syndrome (LGS)IND No.: [ADDRESS_843901] No.:
2021 -002481 -40
Study Number: TAK -935-3002 Amendment 2 Phase: 3
Study Design:
This is a phase 3, global, multicenter, 1:1 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of soticlestat as an adjunctive therapy in pediatric and adult subjects with 
LGS. The treatment period is 16 weeks. The total duration of the study is approximately 25 weeks for subjects who 
complete the study and choose not to roll over to the open -label ext ensio n (OLE) study. For those who roll over to the 
OLE study, the study duration is [ADDRESS_843902] of the following periods:
4-to 6-week screeni ng/baseline period. The minimum visit window for screening is 28 days (ie, Visit 2/Day 0
cannot occur earlier than 29 days after screening).
16-week full treatment period:
–
4-week titration period.
–
12-week maintenance period.
1-week taper period for those discontinuing study drug, followed by a 2 -week safety follow -up visit or a phone 
call.
This is a 2 -arm study. All subjects will be randomized at a 1:[ADDRESS_843903] of care (SOC) plus one of the 
following adjunctive th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: soticlestat or pl acebo.
Soticlestat or matching placebo added to current antiseizure therapy will be administered orally twice daily (BID) with 
or without food or via gastrostomy tube (G -tube) or low -profile gastric tube (MIC-KEY button). A jejunostomy tube 
(J-tube) may be considered following written approval by [CONTACT_602670]. Note: Study drug will be 
administered only orally for subjects enrolled in sites in jurisdictions where alternative means are not permitted.
All doses will be blinded and will unde rgo the same titration scheme, with the same number and type of 
tablets/mini -tabs. Subjects randomized to placebo will undergo a mock titration to ensure the blind is maintained (see 
tables below).

CONFIDENTIALThe total daily dose of study drug (either placebo or sot iclestat) will be calculated based on body weight at Visit 1 
(screening visit) and given BID starting on the morning after Visit 2/Day 0 (ie, on study Day 1) (see tables below). The 
100 mg BID dose (or 100 mg BID equivalent weight -based dosing for weight < 45 kg) is the minimum dose allowed 
during the study. Subjects who cannot tolerate the minimal dose will be discontinued from the study. Subjects 
weighing <45 kg will be dispensed 20 mg mini -tablets or matching placebo. Subjects weighing ≥45 kg may be 
dispe nsed 20 mg mini -tablets or 100 mg tablets or matching placebo.

The study  design allows virtual visits if aligned with institutional or local guidelines, via phone or via any platforms 
approved by [CONTACT_427], in addition to the communication platform offered through the study. Screening (Visit 
1) and Visit 11 (D ay 113)/early termination must be conducted in person; Visit 9 is to be conducted in person if 
possible but may be conducted virtually (via video or phone) in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) 
pandemic and/or based on sponsor approval and if permitted by [CONTACT_427]. In extenuating circumstances, the 
randomization visit (Visit 2) and Visit 11 (Day 113)/early termination can be virtual visits (only via video, not phone), 
with sponsor approval and if permitted by [CONTACT_427]. In addition, any visit identified as a virtual visit in this 
protocol may be conducted in clinic and in person if requested by [CONTACT_423]/parent or guardian and/or at the 
investigator’s discretion.
Dose Titration Period (4 Weeks):
Subjects will take the first dose of study drug (Dose 1) the day after the study medication is received. Approximately 7 
days after initiating study medication, if there are no tolerability issues, study drug dose will be increased to Dose 2. 
After approximately 7 days on Dose 2, if there are no tolerability issues, study drug dose will be increased to Dose 3. 
If the subjects do not experience any tolerability issues, they will continue on Dose 3 for the remainder of the titration 
period. Subjects will only be allowed to increase their dose within the 4 -week titration period before entering the 
12-week maintenance period. Decrease in dose level is allowed during the titration period if required for safety and 
tolerability. Subjects who cannot tolerate the minimum dose of 100 mg BI D (or weight -
based equivalent dosing <45 
kg) will be discontinued from treatment. The maximum allowed dose is 300 mg BID. The subjects/parents or 
caregivers will be contact[CONTACT_632133] 2 days following each dose escalation to assess saf ety and 
tolerability of the study drug. The final dose tolerated by [CONTACT_2671] 4 -week titration period should be maintained 
until the end of the maintenance period, unless tolerability issues arise.
Maintenance Period (12 Weeks):
The dose level at the end of the titration period will be maintained until the end of the maintenance; period (dose 
increases are not permitted); however, during the maintenance period, the dose may be decreased by 1 dose level to the 
previous lower dose, for safety and tolerab ility issues. For example, Dose 3 may be reduced to Dose 2, and Dose 2 may 
be reduced to Dose 1. The minimum dose is Dose 1 (100 mg BID adult reference dose; or weight -based equivalent 
dosing for <45 kg); subjects who cannot tolerate the minimum dose of 10 0 mg BID will be discontinued from 
treatment. Dose changes during the maintenance period are allowed for safety or tolerability reasons as assessed by [CONTACT_1275]; however, if possible, dose changes will need to be discussed with the medical monitor and/or the sponsor.

Statistical Considerations:
Efficacy Analyses
The seizure frequency will be calculated based on all data collected during the baseline and treatment periods. For all 
efficacy analyses on seizure frequency, baseline refers to the prospective 4 -to 6-week baseline period. The efficacy 
endpoints will be summarized for each treatment group, and comparisons will be made between soticlestat and 
placebo groups. Percent change from baseline in MMD seizure frequency per 28 days will be analyzed using rank 
analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group as the main effect; age group ( ≤6 years, >6 years) and 
baseline seizure frequency will be covariates. Sensitivity analyses will be performed using the van Elteren test and the 
Wilcoxon rank sum test. Gender will also be added to the rank ANCOVA model as a sen sitivity analysis.
Percent change from baseline in frequency of all seizures per 28 days will be compared between soticlestat and 
placebo using rank ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline seizure frequency and age stratum. The Hodges -Lehmann 
estimator and the corr esponding 95% CI comparing soticlestat and placebo will also be displayed.
The proportion of responders will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by [CONTACT_551] ( ≤6 years, 
>6 years).

CONFIDENTIALThe main analysis for CGI -I (clinician), Care GI -I, CGI-I Seizure Severity and Duration, CGI -I Nonseizure 
Symptoms, and QI -Disability scores will be based on the responses at each subject’s last visit during which these 
instruments were utilized. The QI -Disability scores will be analyzed with a mixed model for repeated measures and 
the other scores will be analyzed using ordinal logistic regression. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the 
van Elteren test stratified by [CONTACT_941] 2 age groups. A supportive analysis based on responses for completers at th e end of 16 
weeks of treatment will also be performed using ordinal logistic regression.
The global type I error will be controlled using a hierarchical gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_632112]. The order of testing will be soticlestat versus placebo for the primary endpoint, responder rate, Care GI -I, 
CGI-I (clinician), CGI-I Nonseizure Symptoms, QI -Disability, and CGI -I Seizure Intensity and Duration. All 
statistical tests will be 2 -sided at the 5% significance level. Techniques for ha ndling missing information with respect 
to reporting of seizures in the treatment period and with respect to subjects who discontinue early will be specified in 
detail in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).
Safety Analyses
Descriptive statistics will be u sed to summarize all safety endpoints for each of the 2 treatment groups. Two -sided 
95% CIs will be presented where meaningful. Data summaries will be displayed for incidence of AEs, clinical 
laborato ry variables, vital signs, body weight, and ECG paramete rs, as appropriate.

on the EQ -5D-5L quality of life scale will be analyzed for soticlestat and placebo. Descriptive and graphical analyses 
will be used to summarize results from the exploratory endpoints.
Alpha-1 acidic glycoprotein wi ll be analyzed as part of the laboratory serum chemistry panel at each visit where PK 
samples are obtained.
Plasma concentrations of soticlestat and metabolite(s) will be summarized and displayed graphically per nominal time 
points. Mean plasma concentrations over time will be presented graphically.
Correlation of change in PD (24HC) exposure and efficacy (change in MMD seizure over the full treatment period) 
will be investigated.
Sample Size Justification: The study will randomize a total of ap proximately 234 subjects at a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 
dose level of soticlestat or placebo, resulting in approximately 117 subjects per arm.
The primary endpoint for this study is the percent change from baseline in MMD seizure frequency per 28 days. The 
definition for MMD is different for this study than for ELEKTRA, however, the variability of this endpoint is assumed 
to be the same. This leads to an assumption that the pooled SD of the percent change from baseline in MMD seizure 
frequency  is 65%.
A differ ence of 26.5% in mean percent reduction in MMD seizure frequency between treatments is an appropriate 
target. A sample size of [ADDRESS_843910] 85% power at a two -tailed 5% significance 
level to detect a difference of 26 .5% in mean percent reduction in seizure frequency between treatments using the 
Wilcoxon rank -sum test, assuming the pooled SD above of 65%.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Lennox -Gastaut syndro me (LGS) is rare and is one of the most severe forms of childhood 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] . The syndrome usually has its onset between the ages of 1 and 8 years, but occasionally it  
occurs in children who are older than 8 years, or even into adulthood . LGS includes the presence of 
multiple seizure ty pes: the hallmark tonic -atonic drop seizures. Other seizure ty pes include 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_32539], but tonic -clonic, my oclonic, and partial  seizures are also frequently 
present. 
Soticlestat i s a fi rst-in-class small mo lecule inhibit or of cho lesterol -24 hydroxylase (CH24H) in 
the brain. It is hypothesized that soticlestat treatment will decrease the levels o f 
24S- hydroxycho lesterol  (24HC) and improve MMD seizure control in LGS subjects. Nonclinical 
studi eshave dem onstrated that soti clestat m odulates the gl utam atergic si gnaling and significantly 
reduces spontaneous seizure in murine models of LGS. Clinical Study  TAK -935-2002 
(ELEKTRA) showed efficacy  of soticlestat in subjects with Dravet syndrome (DS) or L GS.
ELEKTRA was a phase 2, mult icenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  that 
evaluated the efficacy , safet y, tolerabilit y, pharmacokinet ics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) 
of soticlestat as adjunct ive therapy in pediatric subjects aged ≥2 and ≤17 years with LGS or DS. A 
total of 141 subjects were enrolled (51 with DS and 90 wi th LGS), and 126 com pleted the study . 
Subjects were eligible for enrollment if they demonstrated ≥3convulsive seizures (in the DS 
cohort) or ≥4 drop seizures (in th e LGS cohort) during a minimum of 4 weeks during the 
prospective baseline period (based on the seizure diary  records), and they  were currently on a 
stable regimen of 1 to 4 concomitant antiseizure medicat ions (ASMs). This study  consisted of 
2main periods, a 4-to 6-week screening/baseline period, fo llowed by a 20 -week treatm ent period 
(8-week titration and dose -optimizat ion peri od and a 12 -week maintenance period). Subjects who 
met the entry  criteria were stratified by [CONTACT_602673] a 1:[ADDRESS_843914] acebo at 100 mg twice daily (BID) for 1 week, followed by 200 mg BID for 
another week, before titrating up to 300 mg BI D, the maximum allowable dose. Subjects weighing 
<60 kg were dosed by  [CONTACT_8497].
In the DS cohort (n = 51), subjects treated with soticlestat demonstrated a 33.8% median reduct ion 
in convulsive seizure frequency co
mpared with a 7.0% median increase seen in su bjects taking 
placebo during the 20 -week treatm ent peri od (m edian placebo -adjusted reducti on in convulsive 
seizure frequency was 46.0%; p = 0.0007). The responder rate ( ≥50% reduction in convulsive 
seizure frequency compared with baseline) for subjects taking soticlestat in the DS cohort was 
30.8% while for placebo was 0%. In the LGS cohort (n=88), soticlestat decreased drop seizures by 
a median of 20.6% as compared wit h a m edian decrease of 6% in the placebo group (median 
placebo -adjusted reducti on in seiz ure frequency  was 14.8%, p=0.1279) during the 20- week 
treatm ent peri od. Other secondary  endpoints included the Clinical Glo bal Im pressi on of Change 
(CGI -C) and the Caregiver Global Impression o f Change (Care GI -C). For the CGI- C, more 
soticlestat -treated D S and LGS subjects showed improvement than those receiving placebo

CONFIDENTIAL(26.9% versus 8% and 27.9% versus 11.1%, respectively) as deemed by [CONTACT_3170]. 
Caregivers also rated greater improvement in 57.7% and 51.2% of soticlestat -treated DS and LGS 
subjects compared wi th 32% and 28.9% of those receiving placebo, respectively , as assessed by  
[CONTACT_602674] -C.
In ELEKTRA, soticlestat was generally well tolerated and safet y data were consistent with 
findings in previous studies. The incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was 
similar in the treatment and placebo groups with 57 (80.3%) (n=57) of soticlestat subjects 
experiencing at least 1 TEAE compared with 52 (74.3%) of placebo subjects. The most common 
TEAEs in the soticlestat group were upper resp iratory  tract infect ion, py rexia, seizure, 
nasopharyngit is, decreased appetite, and vo miting. The most frequent TEAEs reported in 
soticlestat -treated subjects with ≥5% difference from placebo were lethargy and const ipation. The 
incidence of serious TEAEs w as similar in both soticlestat and placebo groups, with 11 (15.5%) in 
the soti clestat group experiencing at least 1 serious TEAE compared with 13 (18.6%) in the 
placebo group. Four soticlestat (5.6%) subjects discontinued the study  com pared wi th 3 in the 
placebo group (4.3%) due to TEAEs. 
More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated 
adverse events (AEs) of soticlestat may be found in the current edit ion of the Invest igator’s 
Brochure (IB).
4.2 Rationale for the Prop osed Study
Soticlestat has shown ant iseizure efficacy  in nonclinical studi es, incl uding m odels relevant to the 
rare developmental epi[INVESTIGATOR_602653] (DEEs) that are inadequately treated by  [CONTACT_602675][INVESTIGATOR_006]. In phase 1 studies in healt hy adult subjects and in phase 1b/2a 
(TAK -935- 2001) and phase 2 (ELEKTRA) studies in adult and pediatric subjects with DEEs, 
acceptable PK and safet y characterist ics have been observed.
Based on the efficacy , safet y, and tol erabilit y data collected in the phase 2 ELEKTRA study, 
combined wit h the safet y and tol erabili ty data from  phase 1 and other com pleted or ongoing 
studi es (please see the IB), soticlestat is being proposed as adjunct ive therapy in pediatric and adult  
subjects wi th LGS, a hi ghly impacted popul ation with great unm et need. Thi s phase 3 study  will 
evaluate the efficacy , safet y, and tolerabilit y of soticlestat in this populat ion. The current study  is 
designed to further characterize the effects of soticlestat on MMD seizure frequency by [CONTACT_2329] a 
seizure diary  in subjects wi th LGS. Addit ional aims are to assess efficacy by [CONTACT_093] 
(characteri zed by  [CONTACT_632136] [CGI -I]) as well as by [CONTACT_632137], CGI -I in nonseizure -related symptom s, impact on quali ty of life, and the safet y, 
tolerabilit y, PK, and PD (24HC) of soticlestat administration in pediatric and adult subjects with 
LGS.
4.3 Benefit/Risk Profile
In the phase 1b/2a TAK -
935-2001, phase 2 TAK -935-2002 (ELEKTRA), and open -label pi[INVESTIGATOR_602655] -

CONFIDENTIALgenerally well tolerated in subjects with DEEs at doses up to 300 mg BID ( weight -based dosing for 
<60 kg).
The fo llowing have been ident ified as important potential risks and are being closely mo nitored 
during the clinical development program:
Neurol ogical and psychiatric effects (clinical safety data and risks associated with c ompounds 
affect ing glutamate excitotoxicit y).
Cogni tive effects (soticlestat inhibit ion of neuronal CH24H and clinical safet y data).
Suicidal  ideati on or behaviors (class effect of ASMs).
Cataracts (nonclinical data).
Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongat ion (nonclinical data).
More informat ion about the known and expected benefits and reasonably anticipated AEs of 
soticlestat m ay be found in the current edit ion of the IB. This study will further examine risk and 
establish benefit in LGS. This study  will enroll subjects aged 2 to 55 years, inclusive. 
LGS i s characteri zed by  [CONTACT_632138]-resistant sei zure ty pes, abnorm al 
electroencephalogram (EEG), and intellectual impairment. Given the severe, profound, and 
chronic nature of LGS, its impact on qualit yof life, and i ts associ ated si gns and symptom s, and 
considering the potential benefits that can be conferred to patients affected by  [CONTACT_632139], the 
benefit -risk profile is acceptable for this population.

6.1.1 Dose Titration Period (4 We eks)
Subjects will take the first dose of study  drug (Dose 1) the day  after the study  medicat ion is 
received. Approximately 7 days after init iating study medicat ion, ifthere are no tolerabilit y issues, 
study  drug dose will be increased to Dose 2. After approximately  7 days on Dose 2, if there are no 
tolerabilit y issues, study  drug dose will be increased to Dose 3. If the subjects do not experience 
any tol erabilit y issues, they  will cont inue on Dose 3 for the remainder of the titration period.

CONFIDENTIAL6.2.2 Endpoints
An ideal outcom e measure for assessment of seizures should be clinic ally relevant, easily 
ident ifiable, and reliably counted by [CONTACT_40970]. The primary endpo int is percent 
change from baseline in MMD seizure frequency  per 28 day s for those subj ects on soti clestat 
compared wit h placebo during the 16- week treatm ent period (for EMA regions, analysis will only 
include MMD seizure frequency during the 12 -week m aintenance period). In close cooperation 
with researchers in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_632114], and in consent with The Epi[INVESTIGATOR_632115] (TESC) and consistent with the International League Against Epi[INVESTIGATOR_632116], the sponsor will evaluate soticlestat’s effect in the percent change fro m baseline in 
MMD seizures co mpared with placebo during the full treatment period (or maintenance period for 
EMA registration regions) as the primary efficacy endpo int using the modified intent -to-treat 
(mITT) analysis set.
The secondary  and exploratory  endpoints defined are clinically  meaningful  and consistent wi th 
seizure studies in similar populat ions. The secondary efficacy endpo ints and exploratory endpoints 
could elucidate benefit s outsi de of  seizure reduction to demonstrate soticlestat’s potential impact 
on overall qualit y of life for the subjects (QI- Disabilit y) and f or the parents/caregivers 
(EQ-5D- 5L) and explore the potential for 24HC to be a bio marker for optimal demo nstrati on of  
efficacy .
Measurement of plasma 24HC levels is included in this study  as a PD bi omarker rel ated to the 
mechanism o f action of  soticlestat.
The safet y-related endpoin ts of TEAEs, clinical laboratory  test resul ts, vi tal sign measurements, 
C-SSRS m easurements, and ECG parameters selected for this study  are standard m ethods for 
assessing safet y and tol erabili ty in clinical studies as well as the potential risks for soticl estat.
6.2.3 Dose
Dose sel ection is based on a comprehensive analysis of the safet y, tolerabilit y, PK, and PD data 
from 4 com pleted single -and m ultiple-dose phase 1 studies in healthy subjects; the safet y, 
tolerabilit y, and PK data from the phase 1b/2a study  of soticlestat as adjunct ive therapy in adult 
subjects with DEEs; and the efficacy , safet y, PK, and PD data in the ELEKTRA study  in pediatric 
subjects with DS or LGS, where the same target dose of 300 mg BID (weight -based equivalent in 
pediatrics) demonstrated statist ically significant and clinically meaningful seizure reduction in DS 
subjects while maintaining a favorable safet y and tol erabili ty profile. Num erical reducti on in 
seizure frequency was also noted in subjects with LGS .
The efficacy o f soticlestat is related to CH24H inhibit ion and a decrease in 24HC levels in humans. 
The extent of CH24H inhibit ion required for efficacy  was estimated in an animal model of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] . In a m ouse pent ylenetetrazol -induced kindling development model, effects of soticlestat 
on sei zure severi ty were associ ated wi th the degree of CH24H inhibit ion (Nishi  et al . 2020 ). A 
75% reduction in the severit y score was associated with 90% reduction in brain 24HC levels. The 
minimum required 24HC lowering for efficacy was approximately 60%, yielding 40% decrease in 
the severit y score. The 24HC lowering effect was then con verted into 65% of the CH24H enzyme 
occupancy  (EO) rate, using a m odel established in mice ( Target occupancy  evaluat ion for

CONFIDENTIALcholesterol  24-hydroxylase (CH24H) inhibi tor, s oticlestat , with liquid chro matography /tandem  
mass spectrometry . Report number:[ZIP_CODE] ). In summary , these preclinical pharmacology  studi es 
suggest that high degree of target occupancy ( ≥65%) and 24HC reduction (≥60%) are considered 
to be rel ated to the efficacy in the nonclinical animal model. 
The target dose of 300 mg BID (weight -based eq uivalent in pedi atrics) will achieve the degree 
target occupancy and 24HC reduction required for efficacy. Based on a populat ion PK/PD/EO 
model using data from 4 phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, the phase 1b/2a study in adult subjects 
with DEEs, and th e TAK -935- 2002 (ELEKTRA) study  in pediatric subjects with DS or LGS, the 
300 m
g BID dose (wei ght-based equivalent in pediatrics) is est imated to achieve approximately 
90% EO with approximately 82% decrease in 24HC level and potentially result ing in efficacy.
In addit ion, the same soticlestat target dose of 300 mg BID (adul t reference dose; weight -based 
equivalent dosing <60 kg) was administered in ELEKTRA, and demonstrated seizure reduction in 
LGS subjects while maintaining a favorable safet y and tolerabilit y profile. Approximately 79% of 
subjects in the double -blind, rando mized, placebo -controlled ELEKTRA study  were able to be 
titrated up to and maintained on 300 mg BID (or adult weight -based equivalent) until the end of the 
maintenance period. Soticlestat -treated subjects with LGS reported a 20.6% median reduction in 
drop seizures while those subjects receiving placebo experienced a median decrease of 6% in drop 
seizures (median placebo -adjusted reducti on in seizure frequency was 14.8%) over the 20 -week 
treatm ent peri od. Responder rates ( ≥50% reduction in drop seizure frequ ency com pared wi th 
baseline) for soticlestat -treated subjects with LGS were 16.3% versus 13.3% in placebo, 
respectively . Soti clestat was generally safe and well tolerated at this dose in this study , and safet y 
was consistent with previous studies with no n ew signals identified. The incidence of TEAEs was 
similar between the DS and LGS strata compared wit h placebo with 57 soticlestat subjects (80.3%) 
experiencing at least 1 TEAE compared wit h 52 placebo subjects (74.3%). The most frequent 
TEAEs reported in s oticlestat -treated subjects with ≥5% difference from placebo were lethargy  
and const ipation. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar in both soticlestat 
and placebo groups, with 11 (15.5%) in the soticlestat group experiencing at least 1
treatm ent-emergent SAE compared with 13 (18.6%) in the placebo group. There were no deaths 
reported. The combinat ion of drop seizure reduction and favorable tolerabilit y and safet y profile in 
ELEKTRA support the select ion of 300 mg BID as the soticlestat target dose (adult reference dose; 
weight-based equivalent dosing <45 kg BID).
Before reaching the target dose in the current study, subjects will receive the minimum soticlestat 
dose (ie, 100 mg BID adult equivalent dose for 1 week, followed by 200 mg BID adult equivalent  
dose for 1 week) in the titration phase. The goal of titration is to reach the target final dose of 300 
mg BID adult equivalent dose after a 14 -day titration period; the same titration regimen was 
evaluated in study  ELEKTRA and demonstrat ed a favorable safet y and tol erabilit y profile in 
addition to drop seizure reduction as above. 
The weight -based equivalent dosing in pediatrics was determined using the populat ion PK model. 
Simulations were conducted using body weight intervals of 1 kg, d ose strengths fro m 40 to 300 mg 
using 20 mg mini -tablets and 100 mg tablets, and a BID dosing regimen. A total of 10,000 
simulat ions of steady -state exposure (median area under the plasma concentration -time curve

was set to 35%. Setting the percentage thresho ld at “35%” ensures the safet y of pedi atric subjects 
as the reference AUC values are median steady -state AUC values in adult s, ie, 50% of the adult 
popul ation has AUCs above the reference AUC values while no more than 35% of pediatric 
popul ation will have AUCs above the reference AUC values). Furthermore, an effort has been 
made to keep pediatric exposure fro m exceeding the 90th percentile of the adult exposure. The 
resul ting weight -based equivalent dosing in pediatrics is provided in Table 6.athrough Table 6.d.

Study  subjects will be wit hdrawn fro m the study /study  drug for the fo llowing reasons:
1.Failure to meet continuat ion criteria: Enrollment in any  other clinical  study  involving an 
investigat ional product or enrollment in any  other type of clinical trial judged not to be 
scientifically or medically co mpatible wit h this study .
2.Withdrawal by [CONTACT_53953] (Note: The specific reason for discont inuat ion must be recorded in 
the eCRF, and is only to be used if no other pertinent reason for discont inuat ion is applicable):
a)The invest igator decides that the subject should be discontinued from the study .
b)If the subject, for any  reason, requi res treatm ent with another therapeutic agent, 
discontinuat ion from the study  occurs before introduction of the new agent.
3.Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130]/parent or legal guardian (Note: The specific reason for discontinuatio n 
shoul d be recorded in the eCRF and is only to be used if no other pertinent reason for 
discontinuat ion is applicable). All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason 
for the wi thdrawal  and, where possible, the pri mary  underlying reason should be recorded (ie, 
withdrawal  due to a TEAE shoul d not be recorded in this category . Similarly, l ack of  efficacy 
shoul d not be recorded in this category ).
4.Sponsor decisio n:
a)The sponsor or its designee discont inues the study.
b)Thesponsor or its designee discont inues the subject’s participat ion in the study  for 
medical, safet y, regul atory , or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, 
and GCP.
c)The sponsor or its designee stops the clinical study at a particular sit e.
5.Discontinuati on due to AE: The subject has experienced an AE that requires early terminat ion 
because cont inued participat ion imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health, or the 
subject is unwilling to continue because of the AE.
If the invest igator deci des that the subject should be withdrawn because of an AE or a 
clinically significant laboratory  value, the study  drug is to be discont inued and appropriate 
measures are to be taken. The sponsor or its designee is to be alerted immediately.

CONFIDENTIAL9.1.2 Histo rical Seizure Diary Review
Per inclusion criteria, historical seizure informat ion will be used to support study  entry . It is very  
commo n for caregivers of subjects with LGS to maintain daily seizure diaries that capture both 
seizure ty pe and frequency and days when no seizures occur as part of their SOC treatment 
regimen. A 3- month (12 -week) daily historical seizure diary  will be reviewed at screening 
(Visit1) to determine eligibilit y. In the event that daily seizure diaries are not routinely maintained 
aspart of the SOC, the investigator will be asked to review in detail wit h the subject/caregiver the 
number of seizures over the last [ADDRESS_843956] eligibilit y to the study at 
screening (Visit 1).
9.1.3 Seizure Identification and Diagn ostic Review Forms (TESC)
Per inclusio n criteria, enro llment into the study is based on subject having ≥8MMD seizures each 
month in the 3 mo nths prior to screening based on the historical informat ion and having ≥8MMD 
seizures per 28 day s during the 4- to6-week prospective baseline period (Days -42 to Day -1). To 
confirm diagnosis, standardize seizure ident ification and classificat ion, and approve seizures that 
will be recorded by  [CONTACT_7071]/caregiver in the electronic daily seizure and medication diary , 
a 
Seizure Ident ificat ion Form (SIF)/Diagnost ic Review Form (DRF) will be submitted to, reviewed, 
and approved by [CONTACT_602693]. In addit ion, previously prepared documents (including, but not limited to, 
EEG and imaging results andsummary  reports) may  be sent to TE SC as part of the SIF/DRF for 
diagnosis evaluat ion, if allowed by [CONTACT_24550]. Submissio n of these materials is expected 
shortly  after the screening visit and needs to be approved before randomizat ion.
All new reports of seizures (parent or caregiver descript ions) identified by  [CONTACT_602694] (Vi sit 1) m ust also be reviewed by  [CONTACT_602695]. A new DRF must be submitted to TESC for review and approval for 
all new seizure s and/or recurrence of past (>1 year) ident ified seizures throughout the course of the 
study . Only seizure cl assificat ion/descript ions approved by [CONTACT_602696] c seizure and medication diary  for thi s study .
9.1.4 Seizure Frequency
The p rimary  efficacy  measure i s the percent change fro m baseline in MMD seizure frequency  per 
28 days in subjects on soticlestat as compared with placebo during the treatment period (or during 
the 12-week maintenance period only for EMA registration regions) . Secondary efficacy measures 
include the proportion of responders defined as those with a ≥50% reducti on in MMD seizures 
from baseline.
Seizure frequency will be collected via an electronic daily  seizure and medicat ion diary. The 
electroni c diary  will allow a 7-day window for data entry /correcti on by [CONTACT_423]/parent or 
caregiver. In the event of a device malfunct ion, the subject/parent or caregiver should contact [CONTACT_602697]- up sol ution (access to web back -up) to record daily  seizures 
and medicat ions. The backup paper daily seizure and medicat ion diary will be utilized to ensure

Subject/parent or caregiver will be educated on the importance to record seizures throughout the 
day to ensure that the daily diary  assessment is completed each evening, even if n o seizures 
occurred.
MMD seizures include:
Hemi -clonic or f ocal clonic.
Focal  to bilateral  tonic-clonic.
Generalized tonic -clonic.
Bilateral clo nic.
Focal  seizures wi th major motor si gns (eg hypermotor seizures or involving major body  areas 
such as lower e xtremit ies or trunk) leading to fall or likely fall.
Atonic seizures invo lving major body areas such as lower extremit ies or trunk leading to fall or 
likely  fall.
Tonic seizures invo lving major body areas such as lower extremit ies or trunk leading to fall or 
likely  fall.
Convulsive status.
At the screening visit (Visit 1), the subject/parent or caregiver will be provided with the electronic 
daily  seizure and m edicat ion diary and specific instructions to ensure compliance wit h the seizure 
recording. In addit ion, a corresponding web backup solut ion and paper daily seizure and 
medicat ion diary will be provided in the case of an electronic diary device malfunction. All seizure 
events will be recorded starting at the screening/baseline period up unt il the fo llow-up visit. At 
each visit, the electronic diary will be reviewed, and paper diary co llected, if applicable. All entries 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_632149]/parent or caregiver at the time of each visit to 
ensure proper recording. Any  new se izures that may have occurred since the last visit must be 
reviewed by  [CONTACT_602699] o f a DRF. Only  seizure 
classificat ion/descript ions approved by [CONTACT_632150] .
For the prospective baseline period, the seizure frequency will be calculated as:
(total  number of seizures) / (total number of days seizures were assessed) × 28.
Seizure frequency calculated through this method will be used to confi rm the eligibilit y.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  value), symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th the use o f a drug whether or not 
it is considered related to the drug.
10.1.[ADDRESS_844001] finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre- exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discont inuat ion or a change in dose of study  drug or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered un favorable by [CONTACT_4168].
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded a s 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, signs or symptoms should be recorded 
appropriately as AEs.
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory values or ECG findings are only considered to be AEs if they are judged 
to be clinically signi ficant (i e, if so me act ion or intervent ion is required, or if the invest igator 
judges the change to be beyo nd the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A l aboratory  or 
ECG re- test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value or finding are not cons idered an 
intervent ion. In addit ion, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluatio n 
or monitoring of an abnormalit y is not considered an intervent ion.

CONFIDENTIALIf abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for wh ich there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased serum creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are con sidered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as AEs. Baseline evaluat ions (eg, 
laboratory  tests, ECG, radi ographs) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related to study  
procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or com plicat ion of such a 
concurrent medical condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately 
as a PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study drug) or a TEAE (worsening 
or com plicat ion occurs after start of study  drug). Investigators should ensure that the event 
term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_39747] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), 
any occurrence of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_632123] c aptured as an AE if the condit ion beco mes more 
frequent, serious or severe in nature. Investigators should ensure that the event term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion from baseline (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurr ent medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthri tis), worsening of the condit ion should only be recorded as a AE if occurring to a greater 
extent to that which would be expected. Invest igators should ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after the start of study  drug, 
the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a TEAE. Invest igators should ensure that 
theevent term recorded captures the change in the PTE (eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a TEAE after any  change in study  
drug, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
Changes in intensit y of AEs:
If the subject experiences changes in intensit y of an AE, the event should be captured once 
with the m aximum  intensity recorded.
Preplanned procedures (surgeries or intervent ions):
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled before signing of informed 
consent are not considered AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed early (eg, as 
an emergency) due t o a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the worsening of the condit ion 
shoul d be recorded as an AE. Complications resulting from any planned surgery  shoul d be 
reported as AEs.

Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as AEs but should be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Insufficient clinical response (lack of e fficacy):
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion should NOT be recorded as an 
AE. The invest igator must make the dist inction between exacerbation of pre -exist ing illness 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy.
Overdose:
Cases of overdo se with any medication wit hout m anifested si de effects are NOT considered 
AEs but instead will be documented on an Overdose page of the (e)CRF. Any manifested side 
effects will be considered AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.
10.1.[ADDRESS_844003] medical occurrence that at any  dose:
1.Results in DEATH.
2.Is LIFE THREATENING.
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hyp othetically  might have caused death 
if it were m ore severe.
3.Requi res inpat ient HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_39749].

seizure frequency:
A potential drug -drug interaction with perampanel and soticlestat resulting in increased seizure 
frequency  was noted in [ADDRESS_844005] ion, the fo llowing clinical safet y monitoring and expanded 
evaluat ion will be performed to closely mo nitor seizure frequency in these subjects. (Please 
see Section 9.3.3 .)
Cataracts:
During nonclinical studies, incipi[INVESTIGATOR_602664], subcapsular lent icular cataracts of 
moderate grade were seen in 1 male rat at 300 mg/kg/d and in 1 female rat at 100 mg/kg/d. T o

10.1.5 Intensity of AEs
The different categories o f intensit y (severit y) are characteri zed as follows:
Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.
Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.
10.1.6 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  drug(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from admi nistratio n of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant medications and concu rrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomita nt medicatio ns, and concurrent treatments.
10.1.7 Relationship to Study Procedures

the onset of the AE).
Dose reduced –the dose was reduced due to the particular AE.
Dose increased –the dose was increased due to the particular AE.
Dose interrupted –the dose was int errupted due to the particular AE.
10.1.12 Outcome
Recovered/reso lved – subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE.
Recovering/resolving –the intensit y is lowered by  1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
sign/symptom  has alm ost di sappeared; the abnormal  laboratory  value improved but has not 
returned to the normal range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE wi th the condi tion rem aining “recovering/resolving.”
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs, or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, sign/symptom , or laboratory  value on the l ast day  of the observed 
study  period is worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the subject 
died from another cause w ith the parti cular AE state remaining “not recovered/not resolved.”

10.2 Procedures
10.2.1 Collection and Reporting of AEs
[IP_ADDRESS] AE Collection Period
Collect ion of PTEs will co mmence from the time the subject/parent or legal guardian signs the 
inform ed consent to participate in the study and will cont inue unt il the subject is first administered 
study  drug (Day  1) or until  screen fail ure. For subjects who discont inue before study  drug 
administration, PTEs are collected unt il the subject discont inues study participation.
Collect ion of TEAEs will co mmence from the t ime that the subject is first administered study drug 
(Day  1). Routine co llection of TEAEs will continue until Visit [ADDRESS_844010] ion of TEAEs will cont inue to midnight  
on the day  of Visi t 11.
[IP_ADDRESS] AE Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator wil l assess whether any  subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects m ay report AEs occurri ng at any  other time during the study . Subjects experi encing a 
serious PTE m ust b e monitored until  the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the change. 
Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study  procedure, need not to be fo llowed-up for the 
purposes of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing TEAEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study drug or 
not, m ust be m onitored until  the symptoms subside and any clinically  relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have ret urned to baseline or until a satisfactory  explanati on for the changes is 
observed. All AEs will be documented in the AE page of the eCRF, whether or not the invest igator 
concl udes that the event is related to the drug treatment. The following informat ion will be

13.0 STATISTICAL METHODS
13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A stati stical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before unblinding of subject’s 
treatm ent assi gnment. Thi s docum ent will provide further details regarding the definit ion of 
analysis variables and analysis methodology  to address all study  object ives.
A blinded data review will be conducted before unblinding of subject’s treatment assignment. This 
review will assess the accuracy  and c ompleteness of the study  database, subject evaluabilit y, and 
appropriateness of the planned statist ical methods.
13.2 Determination of Sample Size
The study will rando mize a total of approximately 234 subjects at a 1:[ADDRESS_844021] acebo, result ing in approximately 117 subjects per arm.
The primary endpo int for this study is the percent change fro m baseline in MMD seizure frequenc y 
per 28 day s. The definit ion for MMD i s different for this study  than for ELEKTRA, however, the 
variabilit y of this endpoint i s assumed to be the same. This leads to an assumpt ion that the pooled 
SD of the percent change fro m baseline in MMD seizure frequency is 65%.
A difference of 26.5% in mean percent reduction in MMD seizure frequency between tre atments is 
an appropriate target. A sample size of [ADDRESS_844022] 85% 
power at a two -tailed 5% significance level to detect a difference of 26.5% in mean percent 
reducti on in seizure frequency  between treatm ents using the Wilco xon rank -sum test, assuming 
the pool ed SD above of 65%.
13.2.1 Analysis Sets

All subjects who take at least [ADDRESS_844024] ics will be used to summarize data for 
continuous variables such as age and weight (eg, number of subjects, mean, median, SD, and 
range) and for such categorical variables as sex, ethnicit y, and race (number and percentage of 
subjects wi thin each category ). Medi cal history  and medicat ion history  will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].
13.2.[ADDRESS_844025] Disposition
All subjects who discont inue from the study  will be i dentified. If known, a reason for their 
discontinuat ion will  be given.
13.2.4 Efficacy Analysis
The primary  efficacy  analysis will be performed on the mITT analysis set. The seizure frequency 
will be calculated based on all data collected during the baseline and treatment periods. For all 
efficacy  analyses on seizure frequency , baseline refers to the prospective 4 -to 6-week baseline 
period. The efficacy endpoints will be summarized for each treatment group, and comparisons will 
be made between the soticlestat and placebo groups. The primary objective of the study  is to 
demonstrate that soti clestat i s superior to placebo. The primary  endpoint (percent change from 
baseline in MMD seizu re frequency per 28 day s) will be analyzed using rank analysis of 
covari ance (ANCOVA) with treatment group as the main effect; age group ( ≤6years, >6 years), 
and baseline seizure frequency will be covariates. Sensit ivity analyses on the primary  endpoint 
will be perform ed using the van Elteren test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Gender will also be 
added to the rank ANCOVA model as a sensit ivity analysis.
The proportion of responders will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by 
[CONTACT_654] g roup ( ≤6 years, >6 y ears).
The m ain analysis for CGI -I (clinician), Care GI -I, CGI -I Seizure Intensit y and Durat ion, CGI -I 
Nonseizure Symptoms, and QI -Disabilit y scores will be based on the responses at each subject’s 
last vi sit where these instrum ents wer e utilized. The QI- Disabilit y scores will be analyzed with a 
mixed model for repeated measures, and the other scores will be analyzed using ordinal logist ic 
regression. Sensit ivity analyses will be performed as specified in the SAP.

13.2.5 Safety Analysis
Descript ive statistics will be used to summarize all safet y endpoints for each of the treatment 
groups. AEs will be summarized using the safet y analysis set. All AEs wi ll be coded using 
MedDRA. Data will be summarized using Preferred Terms and primary  System  Organ Classes.
Two-sided 95% CIs will be presented where meaningful. Data summaries will be displayed for

guardian and/or at the investigator’s discretion.
b The minimum duration for screening is 28 days (ie , V2 [Day 0/randomization] cannot occur earlier than 29 days after V1 [screening]). All efforts shall be made to 
complete all procedures at randomization visit (V2 [Day 0/randomization]). If unable to complete, reason should be captured a nd subject can pro ceed to 
randomization if there are no clinically significant abnormalities in screening procedures and it is thought appropriate, in the investigator’s judgment. For female 
subjects of childbearing potential, pregnancy test at V2 (Day 0/ randomization) is not required for eligibility if performed and confirmed negative at V1 (screening) 
and if the investigator does not deem it necessary to repeat pregnancy test at V2 (Day 0/ randomization) .
cDose 1 is started the morning after V2 (Day 0/ randomization) or the day after study  medication is received. Dose 2 and Dose 3 are started the evening of dose 
titration (V4 [Day 8] and V6 [Day 15], respectively).
dApproximately 2 days after starting Dose 1 and after each dose escalation or taper and before the next visit, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_602717], to assess the tolerability and safety of the study drug, and to monitor concomitant medication use and treat ment -emergent AEs. These safety 
checks at V3 (Day  3), V5 (Day  10), and V7 (Day 17)are calculated as approximately 2 days after starting Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3, respectively.
eDates of V4 [Day 8] and V6 [Day 15] are calculated from the date of the first dose (Day 1) and the date of titration to Dose 2 (V6 [Day 15]), respective ly.
fDates calculated from V2 (Day 0/ randomization) .
gSubjects who do not continue into the OLE study will undergo the dose taper procedures and will then proceed to the follow -up period.

jA 12 -lead ECG will be recorded at V1 (Day -42 to -1/screening), V2 (Day 0/ randomization ), V9 (Day 57), and V11 (Day 113)/ET and will be read locally. ECG at 
V1 needs to be recorded before randomization to evaluate subject’s eligibility.
kAt V11 (Day 113)/ET, subjects who do not enroll in the OLE study will be dispensed study drug to taper down . Subjects who enroll in the OLE study should take 
their final dose of double -blind study drug in the evening of the day of V11 (Day  113)/ET .
lThe timing of the follow -up phone call, follow -up period, or follow -up visit will depend on the dose taper proce dures followed. Visit will be eliminated for subjects 
enrolled in OLE.
mFor female subjects of childbearing potential, pregnancy test at V2 (Day 0/ randomization) is not required for eligibility if performed and confirmed negative at V1 
(screening) and if the investigator does not deem it necessary to repeat pregnancy test at V2 (Day 0/ randomization) . A serum or urine hCG pregnancy test will also

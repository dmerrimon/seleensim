 Statistical Methodology  Assess the proportion of ADT naïve men 
who progress and require ADT at 15 
months.  
1 OBJECTIVES  
We hypothesize that treatment with Radium -223 and focal radiotherapy to 5 
or fewer sites of clinically detectable bony metastases will delay the time to 
start systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (androgen deprivation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ADT) or other 
antineoplastic systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) . This hypothesis  will be tested through the 
following aims.  
1.1 Primary Objectives and Endpoint  
 Determine if 20% of ADT naïve men treated with concurrent EBRT 
and Radium -223 will not require ADT for progression by 15 months .  
Endpoint: Determine the time from start of study therapy to start of 
ADT.  
1.2 Secondary Objectives and Endpoint  
 Determine the hormone -therapy  free survival time for men treated with 
concurrent EBRT  and Radium -223 and determine whether  it is a 30% 
risk reduction over the SWOG intermittent ADT historic cohort  
Endpoint: Determine the time from sta rt of study therapy to start of 
ADT.  
 Evaluate h ealth -related quality of life (QOL) as scored by [CONTACT_941] 50 -item 
Expanded Prostate Inventory Composite (EPIC) EPIC urinary, bowel, 
sexual , and hormonal domains . The PROMIS  29 will be used to assess 
general function and well -being  
Endpoint: The PROMIS [ADDRESS_433754] skeletal related event ( SRE) 
Endpoint: Documentation of complications associated with bone 
metastases and may include (but not limited to) fractures, spi[INVESTIGATOR_6710], bone pain, and hypercalcemi a. 
 Evaluate the PSA doubling time  
Endpoint: Time elapsed from baseline PSA to double in value.  
  
 Evaluate  overall survival at 2 years relative to  the SWOG intermittent 
ADT historic cohort . 
Endpoint: Patients will be followed for survival for two years after 
study enrol lment

 Evaluate CTCAE version 4.0 toxicities in the study population  
Endpoint: Patients will be monitored for adverse events related to 
Radium -223 and EBRT using CTCAE criteria.  
1.3 Exploratory Objectives  
 Evaluate whether  a commercially available cell -cycle progression gene 
assay (Myriad CCP ) performed on the original prostate biopsy or 
surgical pathol ogy specimen correlates with biochemica l or clinical 
progression free survival in the study population.  
 Evaluate whether  a commercially available homologous recombination 
DNA repair assay correlates with biochemical or clinical progression 
free survival in the study population (Myriad HRD ). 
 
2 BACKGROUND  
 
Background: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the [LOCATION_002] 
and second leading cause of cancer death . At diagnosis, approximately 10% of men will 
have bone metastases identified on technetium bone scan [1]. These bone metastases can 
result in skeletal related events (SREs) cau sing substantial morbidity  [2]. Men with five 
or fewer prostate cancer bone metastases noted on  initial bone scan have a 94% 2 -year 
survival rate, and a  significantly favorable overall survival when compared to those with 
more lesions  [3]. The current standard of care for men with overt metastatic disease is 
immediate androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)  [4]. Long term androgen deprivation 
therapy results in a significant decrement in quality of life [5] and a host of unfavorable 
side effects including but not limited to loss of libido, lack of energy, difficulty 
concentrating, hot flashes, decreased bone density, decreased muscle mass, and increased 
risk of heart attack and stroke . Although ADT will delay the appearance of tumor related 
symptoms in metastatic patients, there are no data that it prolongs overall surviva l[4]. 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_349095] . External 
beam radiation treatment is effective at controlling both primary and metastatic prostate 
cancers, and Radium -[ADDRESS_433755] been shown to palliate painful bony lesions.  
 
Rationale for the combination of Radium -223 and External Beam Radiation: Radium -223 
is a calcium -mimetic radiopharmaceutical that accumulates in bones and emits alpha 
radiation from Radium -223 decay and releases relatively high energy with a narrow range 
(2 to 10 cells) [5]. Following promising results in a phase II trial, the phase III 
ALSYMPCA trial was conducted in mCRPC with symp tomatic bone metastases who 
either had received or were ineligible for docetaxel [6, 7] . Patients received 6 doses of 
Radium -223 50 kBq/kg intravenously every 4 weeks . A pre -planned interim analysis 
showed a significant 2.8 -month median OS benefit compared to the placebo arm (14 vs. 
11.2 months), which is anticipated to lead to regulatory approval  [8]. An updated analysis

Page [ADDRESS_433756] ratio of 
0.695 (i.e., 30.5% reduction in risk of death) [9]. Moreover, the toxicity profile appeared 
excellent with grades 3 -4 neutropenia in 1.8% and thrombocytopenia in 4% of p atients . 
Reassuringly, long -term, 24-month outcomes in the previous randomized phase II trial 
showed no increase in hematologic toxicities [6, 7] .  
 
Radiotherapy for Oligometastasis: In 1995, Hellman and Weichselbaum coined the term 
“oligometastases” to characterize a state of limited metastasis in which aggressive local 
control measures could be potentially curative  [10, 11] . This led to the development of 
prospective clinical trials employing the use of Stereotactic Body R adiotherapy (SBRT) 
to ablate visible oligometastatic disease with curative intent  [12]. This approach has been 
demonstrated to be safe and effective, with local control rates in the 80% range, and 
durable progression -free survival rates around 20% . In one of the onl y trials evaluating 
the role of SBRT exclusively in 40 patients with bone on ly metastatic prostate cancer, t he 
actuarial 24 -month local tumor control rate was 95.5% as measured by [CONTACT_349115] 5.4 n g/dl which dropped to 2.7 
ng/dl after 3 months  [13]. We propose that the combination of external beam 
radiotherapy and Radium -223 will be an effective therapy at controlling oligometastatic 
prostate cancer in hormone -therapy naïve patients.  
 
Comparator Cohort:  
 
At the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, 100% of persons have been 
started on systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_349096] [ADDRESS_433757] that are not specified as the primary aim:  
 
In 2012 the SWOG cooperative group reported mature results of a randomized trial 
evaluating continuo us versus intermittent androgen -deprivation therapy in men  with 
hormone -naïve metastatic prostate cancer  [14]. This trial was pi[INVESTIGATOR_349097] -
naïve metastatic prostate cancer, as a median survival benefit was noted over the 
intermittent cohort despi[INVESTIGATOR_75154], statistically speaking, inferiorit y of intermittent 
therapy was not pro ven nor disproven . Men on the intermittent therapy arm did have 
significant improveme nt in quality of life domains . Notably, 78%  of persons on the 
“intermittent” androgen therapy arm had to resume ADT within the first 1 5 months . 
Additionally, the investigators of this study classified patients as having “minimal” 
versus “extensive” disease as an analysis stratification . Minimal disease was defined as 
disease confined to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  pelvic bones, or lymph nodes . Those with  visceral 
metastasis or other bony sites were classified as extensive . At 2 years, subjects with 
“minimal disease” receiving intermittent androgen deprivation had an 85%  overall 
survival . We propose using the intermittent ADT cohort of the SWOG trial as a historic 
comparator of efficacy to this study.

3 DRUG AND RADIATION THERAP Y INFORMATION   
3.1 Radium Ra-223 (Drug information for Radium -223 taken from the 
investigators brochure  and Xofigo prescribing information . 
 Description  
 
Radium Ra-223 dichloride, an alpha particle -emitting pharmaceutical, is a 
radiotherapeutic drug . Radium Ra-223 dichloride is supplied as a clear, colorless, 
isotonic, and sterile solution to be administered intravenously with pH between 6 
and 8 . Each milliliter  of solu tion contains 1100 kBq R adium -223 dichloride (30 
microcurie), corresponding to 0.58 ng radium -- 223, at the reference date . Radium 
is present in the solution as a free divalent cation . Each vial contains 6 mL of 
soluti on (6,600 kBq (178 microcurie) R adium -223 dichloride at the reference 
date) . The inactive ingredients are 6.3 mg/mL sodium chloride USP (tonicity 
agent), 7.2 mg/mL sodium citrate USP (for pH adjustment), 0.2 mg/mL 
hydrochloric acid USP (for pH adjustment), and water for injection USP . The 
mole cular weight of Radium -223 dichloride, 223RaCl2, is 293.9 g/mol. Radium -
223 has a half -life of 11.4 days . The specific activity of R adium -223 is 1.9 MBq 
(51.4 microcurie)/ng . The six -stage -decay of R adium -223 to stable lead -207 
occurs via short -lived daugh ters, and is accompanied predominantly by [CONTACT_349116] . There are also beta and gamma emissions with different energies and 
emission probabilities . The f raction of energy emitted from R adium -223 and its 
daughters as alpha -particles is 95.3% (energy rang e of 5 - 7.5 MeV) . The fraction 
emitted as beta -particles is 3.6% (average energies are 0.445 MeV and 0.492 
MeV), and the fraction emitted as gamma -radiation is 1.1% (energy range of 0.01 
- 1.27 MeV) .  
 
NIST Standardization  
 
The quantification of R adium -[ADDRESS_433759] reference material (SRM) using an official dial 
setting (primary standardization) as published ( as provided in the Investigator 
Brochure ). The NIST SRM is used to calibrate the instruments in production and

Page [ADDRESS_433760] traceable Ra -223 reference mate rials 
which are then sent to the end users (e.g., nuclear medicine laboratory physicians 
or technicians) for dial -setting of their dose calibrators, to allow verification of the 
patient dose.  
 
In 2014, NIST performed a re -assessment of the primary standard ization based on 
preliminary information suggesting a potential discrepancy of approximately 8 -
10% between the published NIST primary standardization ( as provided in the 
Investigator Brochure ) and results obtained by [CONTACT_101431] 
([LOCATION_008], [LOCATION_013], Japan) . After completion of the re -assessment, NIST 
reported their findings ( ss provided in the Investigator Brochure ) and had issued a 
revised NIST SRM in [ADDRESS_433761] standardization was 
determined to be −9.5% between activity values obtained using the old reference 
standard relative to the new primary standardization . Consequently the current 
numerical values need to be corrected by [CONTACT_101432]. + 10.5%.  
 
The current NIST standard for R adium -[ADDRESS_433762] until 
4/25/16 . As of that date the FDA approved the regulatory variation submitted for 
Radium -223. The change in the numerical description of the patient’s dose, 
product strength and labeled  vial activity does not impact the safety or efficacy of  
Radium -223. The change in the NIST Radium -[ADDRESS_433763] on 
subjects; dose subjects are receiving, and will continue to receive . Subjects will 
receive the same actual dose and volume that was studied in Study [ZIP_CODE] (BC1 -
06 dosimetry study) and  is associated with the proven safety and efficacy of 
Radium -[ADDRESS_433764].  The current dose regimen of Radium -
223 is 55 kBq (1.49 microcurie) per kg body weig ht.  
 Mechanism of Action  
The active moiety of Radium Ra-223 dichloride is the alpha particle -emitting 
isotope Radium -223 (as radium Ra-223 dichloride), which mimics calcium and 
forms complexes with the bone mineral hydroxyapatite at areas of increased bone  
turnover, such as bone metastases . The high linear energy transfer of alpha 
emitters (80 keV/micrometer) leads to a high frequency of double -strand DNA 
breaks in adjacent cells, resulting in an anti -tumor effect on bone metastases . The 
alpha particle range from Radium -223 dichloride is less than 100 micrometers 
(less than 10 cell diameters) which limits damage to the surrounding normal 
tissue.  
 Preclinical  
In single and repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, the main findings were 
reduced body weight gain, hematological changes, reduced serum alkaline 
phosphatase and microscopic findings in the bone marrow (depletion of 
hematopoietic cells, fibrosis), spleen (secondary extra -medullary hematopoiesis) 
and bone (depletion of osteocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibro -osseous lesions,

 disruption/disorganization of the physis/growth line) . These findings  were related 
to radiation -induced impairment of hematopoiesis and a reduction of osteogenesis 
and occurred beginning in the dose range of  20 (0.[ZIP_CODE] mCi) – 80 kBq (0.0022  
mCi) per kg body weight, with the exception of body weight decreases.  
Dose -limiting myelotoxicity was seen in dogs after single a dministration of 450 
kBq (0.012 mCi) Radium Ra -223 dichloride per kg body weight  (9 times th e 
clinically recommended dose) .  
Osteosarcomas, a known effect of bone -seeking radionuclides, were observed at 
clinically relevant doses in rats 7 to  12 months after start of treatment . 
Osteosarcomas were not observed in dog studies . The presence of neopla stic 
changes, other than osteosarcomas, was also reported in the longer term (12 to 15 
months) rat toxicity studies . Due to its mode of action, and as seen with 
conventional radiotherapy and other radiotherapeutics, Radium -[ADDRESS_433765] not been performed.  
 
No histological changes were observed in organs involved in the excretion of 
Radium Ra -223 dichloride . No significant effects were seen on v ital organ 
systems, i.e. , cardiovascular (dog), respi[INVESTIGATOR_209529] (rat), 
after single dose administration of 450 to 1000 kBq (0.012  to 0.027 mCi) per kg 
body weight (9 (dog) to 20 (rat) times the clinically recommended dose.  
 Clinical E xperience Summary  
The clinical development of Radium Ra -223 dichloride includes phase I and 
phase II studies in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases . The results of 
these completed studies indicated that safet y and tolerability of Radium Ra -223 
dichloride in CRPC/HRPC patients with bone metastases was well tolerated, and 
that there was evidence of dose related efficacy against bone markers and other 
markers of disease . In addition there was an effect on median overall survival in a 
Phase II (BC1 -02) placebo -controlled study . These studies enabled the initiation 
of the Phase III ALSYMPCA (ALpharadin in SYMptomatic Prostate CAncer) 
study.  
The clinical s afety and efficacy of Radium Ra -[ADDRESS_433766] been evaluated 
in a double -blind, randomized, multiple dose, phase III multicenter study 
(ALSYMPCA) in castration -resistant prostate cancer patients with bone 
metastases . The primary efficacy endpoint was Overall Survival (OS).

 At the cut -off date of the pre -planned interim analysis, a total of 809 p atients were 
randomized 2:1 to receive Radi um Ra -223 dichloride 50 kBq (0.0014 mCi)/kg 
intravenously every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (N=541) plus best standard of care or 
matching placebo plus best standard of care (N=268) . Best standard of care 
included e.g. , local external beam radiotherapy, corticosteroids, antiandrogens, 
estrogens, estramustine , or ketoconazole.  
An updated descriptive analysis of safety and of OS was performed in 921 
randomized patients prior to implementing crossover (i.e. , offering patien ts in the 
placebo group to receive Radium Ra -223 dichloride treatment).  
The results of both, interim and updated analysis, revealed that OS was 
significantly longer in patients treated with Radium Ra -[ADDRESS_433767] of care (HR =0.6 95 (95% CI 
0.581/0.832), median OS 14.9 months versus 11.3 months, respectively).  
In the ALSYMPCA study, the results of the interim analysis and the updated 
analysis showed also a significant improvement in all main secon dary endpoints 
in the Radium Ra -223 dichloride arm compared to the placebo arm:  
 Time to first SRE (defined as time to EBRT, time to first pathological bone 
fracture, time to spi[INVESTIGATOR_209530]) was 
statistically significantly longer in the Radium -223 chloride group compared to 
placebo (median number of months=15.6 for Radium -223 chloride versus 9.8 
months for placebo (HR=0.658, 95 CI 0.522 –0.830, p=  0.[ZIP_CODE]).  
 Time to total ALP progression (defined as ≥ 25% increase compared to 
baseline/nadir) was statistically significantly longer in the Radium -223 chloride 
group 7.4 months compared to placebo 3.8 months  (HR  = 0.167, 95% CI 0.129 – 
0.217; p=  <0.[ZIP_CODE]).  
 Time to  PSA progression (defined as a ≥ 25% increase and an increase in absolute 
value of ≥ 2 ng/mL compared to baseline/nadir ) was also significantly prolonged 
in patients receiving Radium Ra -223 dichloride  compared to patients receiving 
placebo (HR  = 0.643, 95 % CI 0.539,0.768; p  = <0.[ZIP_CODE])  
 A total ALP response (defined as a confirmed ≥ 30% or ≥ 50% reduction 
compared to baseline) at week 12 was observed in higher proportions of subjects 
who were treated with Radium -223 chloride group (47%  and 3% respectively)  
compared to those in the placebo (3% and <1% respectively) group.  
 Subgroup survival analysis showed a consistent survival benefit for treatment 
with Radium Ra-223 dichloride, independent of total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
current use of bisphosphonates , prior use of docetaxel and baseline ECOG status .

As an adverse reaction, grade 3 -4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 6% of 
patients on Radium Ra-223 dichloride and in 2% of patients on placebo. Among 
patients who received Radium Ra-223 dichloride, the laboratory abnormality 
grade 3 -4 thrombocytopenia occu rred in 1% of docetaxel naïve patients and in 4% 
of patients who had received prior docetaxel. Grade 3 -4 neutropenia occurred in

docetaxel.  
Fluid Status  
Dehydration occurred in 3%  of patients on Radium Ra-223 dichloride and 1% of 
patients on placebo. Radium Ra-223 dichloride increases adverse reactions such 
as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting which may result in dehydration.

trials with Radium -223 dichloride in follow -up of up to three years. H owever, the 
radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence 
of cancer (e.g. , sarcomas of the bone, or leukemia), mutations and a potential for 
development of hereditary defects.  
Bone Marrow Suppression  
In the randomized tr ial, 2% of patients on the Radium Ra-223 dichloride arm 
experienced bone marrow failure or ongoing pancytopenia compared to no 
patients treated with placebo. There were two deaths due to bone marrow failure 
and for 7 of 13 patients treated with Radium Ra-223 dichloride, bone marrow 
failure was ongoing at the time of death. Among the 13 patients who experienced 
bone marrow failure, 54% required blood transfusions. Four percent (4%) of 
patients on the Radium Ra-223 dichloride arm and 2% on the placebo arm 
permanently discontinued therapy due to bone marrow suppression.  
In the randomized trial, deaths related to vascular hemorrhage in association with 
myelosuppression were observed in 1% of Radium Ra-223 dichloride -treated

 patients compared to 0.3% of patients treated with placebo. The incidence of 
infection -related deaths (2%), serious infections (10%), and febrile neutropenia 
(<1%) were similar for patients treated with Radium Ra-223 dichloride and 
placebo.  
Myelosuppression; notably thrombocytopenia, neutropen ia, pancytopenia, and 
leukopenia; has been reported in patients treated with Radium Ra-223 dichloride. 
In the randomized trial, complete blood counts (CBCs) were obtained every [ADDRESS_433770] patients recovered approximately 6 to 8 weeks after 
administration.  
In the R adium -233 arm of the Phase 3 clinical trial reported in Parker et al. (2013) 
12.7% (76/600) of subjects had grade 3+ anemia, 6.5% (39/600) of subjects had 
grade 3+ thrombocytopenia, and 2.2% (13/600) of subjects had grade 3+ 
neutropenia.  
The safety and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy with Radium Ra-[ADDRESS_433771] not been established. Outside of a clinical trial, concomitant use 
with chemotherapy is not rec ommended due to the potential for additive 
myelosuppression. If chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes or hemibody

 6 STRATIFICATION  
Not Applicable: This study will c onsist of subjects initially diagnosed 
with M0 prostate cancer at presentation who have completed definitive 
treatment to the prostate, seminal vesicles , and regional lymph nodes (if 
applicable), who then later developed oligometastatic disease.  
7 TREATMENT GUIDELINE  
7.1 External Beam Radiation Administration Schedule  
 All external beam radiations  oligometastatic sites will commence after 
cycle one of Radium -223 but prior to cycle two of Radium -223.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  All lesions seen on bone scan and corroborated by [CONTACT_349119]. If there are additional 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_349101], CT, MRI, 
PET/CT , or treatment -planning simulation scans, but not 
corroborated by a second scan, they can be targeted at 
the treating physician’s discretion as  long as no more 
than 5 lesions total are targeted with external beam 
radiation.  
 External Beam radiation for Oligometastasis  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Specification  
 
All subjects will receive Stereotactic body or hypofractionated radiation to 
sites of bone disease seen  on imaging studies using any one of the 
isoequivalent radiation regimens (based on the linear quadratic model with 
EQD2=60gy and an alpha/beta  ration for prostate cancer= 2) . EQD2 
(equivalent radiobiological dose if converted to 2Gy daily fractions) is be ing 
utilized to allow the radiation oncologist the flexibility to give an ablative 
dose to tumor but allow for differing regimens to spare critical normal tissues 
depending on tumor location.  
Any of the following regimens are considered ablative, acceptab le, and are 
biolog ically equivalent to 60Gy EQD2:  
o Single fraction: 16 Gy total at 16  Gy per fraction (SBRT)  
o Three fractions: 24  Gy total at 8 Gy per fraction (SBRT)  
o Five fractions: 30 Gy total at 6  Gy per fraction (SBRT) . When using 
five fractions, can red uce to 25 Gy total at 5 Gy per fraction  (SBRT) or 
to a minimum of 20 Gy  total at 4 Gy per fraction (SBRT), per treating 
investigator.  
o Six fractions: 32.4 Gy total at 5.4Gy per fraction (Hypofractionated ) 
If any of the fractions need to be further reduced, this can be done in 
consultation with the medical monitor.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Target Localization  
 
This study requires the use of IGRT. NRG Onco logy defines IGRT as a 
computer -assisted process that uses imaging devices that generate a series of 
coordinates for shift ing the patient support system in three orthogonal 
directions (sometimes including rotational changes) to position the treatment 
beams relative to target regions. The allowed technologies are as follows: 
cone -beam CT (CBCT) using either a specially mounted  kV imaging head or 
the MV treatment beam with an opposed electronic imaging panel, dual 
fixed -position in -room kV imaging systems that are orthogonal or near 
orthogonal, an in -room standard diagnostic CT scanner that is geometrically 
linked to the treatme nt unit, and the tomotherapy approach.  
Simple portal imaging approaches that do not use computer assistance are not 
considered to be suitable for this study.  
When the treatment equipment is not equipped with any device that allows 
direct visualization of a natomical structures using the treatment beam, the 
recommendations of AAPM Task Group Report [ADDRESS_433781] be performed routinely for the CyberKnife, Tomotherapy 
units as well as any BrainLab equipment that does not include an electronic 
portal imaging device (EPID) that intercepts the treatment beam.

[IP_ADDRESS] P lanning Techniques   
General Considerations : A variety of planning techniques can be used to 
deliver SBRT for each metastas is. General guidelines include the following:  
 Multiple coplanar or non -coplanar beam arrangements are  acceptable.  
 Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_433782] 10 beams be used when  
possible.  
 A minimum field dimension of 3 cm should be observed treating small  
metastases.  
 Dynamic conformal arcs are acceptable. It is recommended that 
arcs span at least  340 degrees.  
 For non -IMRT or dose painting techniques, the conformal field 
aperture size and shap e should correspond nearly identically to the 
projection of the PTV along a beam’s eye view (i.e., no additional 
“margin” for dose buildup at the edges of the blocks or MLC jaws 
beyond the PTV). The only exception will be when observing the 
minimum field d imension of 3 cm when treating small  lesions.  
 The prescription isodose line covering 95% the PTV will generally 
be 80 -90% but may range from 60 -90% where the maximum dose is 
100%. As a result, a “hotspot” will exist within the PTV that is 
equal to the pres cription dose divided by [CONTACT_349120] (i.e., 45Gy/0.6 = 75Gy when 45Gy is prescribed to the 60%  
isodose).  
 Doses higher than the prescription isodose (i.e., hotspots) should 
be manipulated  to occur within the  target.  
 
Dose calculations : All dose distributions shall include corrections for  tissue 
heterogeneities. Normalization : The treatment plan should be initially 
normalized such that 100% corresponds to the maximum dose within the PTV

 (MAXPTV). While this point will typi[INVESTIGATOR_349104], 
it can be located elsewhere  within the  PTV.  
1. Prescription Isodose Surface Coverage : The prescription isodose surface 
will be chosen such that 95% of the target volume (PTV) is conformally covered 
by [CONTACT_349121].  Doses less than 95% of the prescription dose 
are restricted to the outside edges of the PTV. The prescription isodose surface 
selected MUST be ≥ 60% and ≤90% of the dose maximum within the PTV 
(MAXPTV). The MAXPTV corresponds to the normalization point (1 00%)  of 
the plan as noted above.  
2. Target Dose Heterogeneity : Rather than prioritizing target dose 
homogeneity, SBRT treatment planning prioritizes adequate minimum target 
coverage and rapid dose fall -off gradients outside of the target. Hot spots 
within tar gets are generally accepted without consequence since targets are 
mostly tumor. The only  exception is when the hotspot within the PTV also 
intersects an OAR.  
3. Critical Organ Doses : Respect all critical organ dose volume limits as 
described by [CONTACT_5640]: The re port of AAPM Task Group 101, the NRG BR -001 
protocol, or the RTOG 0631 treatment protocol.   
4. High -Dose  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]:  
a. Location : Any dose > 105% of the prescription dose should occur within the 
PTV and not within the normal tissues outside the PTV.  
b. Volume : Accep table isodose distributions should be as conformal as 
possible. To this end the ratio of prescription isodose volume to PTV should 
be as small as  possible.  
i. The ratio of the prescription isodose volume to the PTV volume should be < 
1.2. Acceptable va riation s include a ratio of 1.[ADDRESS_433783] the prescription dose in 
cGy.  
ii. Guidelines for the ratio of the 50% prescription isodose volume to the PTV 
volume (R50%) and for the maximum dose at 2cm  (D2cm) from the PTV 
are given in Table [IP_ADDRESS] . Because it may become more difficult to restrict  
the 50% isodose volume when dose is summed from treatment of multiple 
metastases, this ratio should be evaluated for dose calculated for a single 
metastasis (i.e., not for composite dose). This is acceptable as long as 
normal tissue constraints are  met. 
iii. Elliptically shaped metastases as well as extremity metastases  may not meet 
these guidelines. This is acceptable as long as normal tissue constraints are  
respected.  
iv. These criteria will not be required in treating very small tumors  (<2.5 cm 
axial GTV dimensi on or < 1.5 cm craniocaudal GTV dimension) in which 
the required minimum field size of 3 cm results in the inability to meet a 
conformity ratio of 1.5.

 safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions 
should be taken.  
 Radiation protection RA -223 
 
The administration of Radium Ra-223 dichloride is associated with potential risks 
for other persons (e.g ., medical staff, care givers , and members of the patient’s 
family) from radiation or contamination from spi[INVESTIGATOR_101393], 
feces, or vomit. Therefore, radiation protection precautions must be taken in 
accordance with national and local r egulations.  
 
For drug handling  
Follow the normal working procedures for the handling of radiopharmaceuticals 
and use universal precautions for handling and administration such as gloves and 
barrier gowns when handling blood and bodily fluids to avoid conta mination. In 
case of contact [CONTACT_194663], the affected area should be flushed immediately 
with water. In the event of spi[INVESTIGATOR_101394]-223 dichloride, the local 
radiation safety officer should be contact[CONTACT_194664]. A complexing 
agent such as 0.01 M ethylene -diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution is 
recommended to remove contamination.  
 
For patient care  
Whenever possible, patients should use a toilet and the toilet should be flushed 
several times after each use. When handling bodily fluids, simply wearing gloves 
and hand washing will protect caregivers. Clothing soiled with Radium Ra-223 
dichloride or patient fecal matter or urine should be washed promptly  and 
separately from other clothing.  
 
Radium -223 is primarily an alpha emitter, with a 95.3% fraction of energy 
emitted as alpha -particles. The fraction emitted as beta -particles is 3.6%, and the 
fraction emitted as gamma -radiation is 1.1%. The external ra diation exposure 
associated with handling of patient doses is considerably lower in comparison to 
other radiopharmaceuticals for therapeutic purposes as the administered 
radioactivity will usually be below ) (8.8MBq(0.238mCi )). In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_349105] (ALARA) principle, for minimization of 
radiation exposure, it is recommended to minimize the time spent in radiation 
areas, to maximize the distance t o radiation sources, and to use adequate 
shielding. Any unused product or materials  used in connection with the 
preparation or administration are to be treated as radioactive waste and should be 
disposed of in accordance with local regulations . The gamma radiation associated

 Radium Ra-223 dichloride can be measured in a normal dose calibrator 
instrument.  A vial of Radium Ra-223 dichloride for technical use will be sent to 
the study center.  
 
Different clinical study centers possess dose calibrators from various suppliers; 
thus, the isotope calibration factor may differ from center to center. Consequently, 
each center must perform the Radium Ra-223 dichloride dial setting on their 
relevant dose  calibrator(s) the amount of Radium Ra-223 dichloride in the vial 
will be stated on the label. Instructions for the dial setting, including the 
calibration log form, will be enclosed with the dispatch of the calibration sample.  
 Dosimetry  
 
The absorbed radi ation dose calculation was performed based on clinical 
biodistribution data. Calculations of absorbed doses were performed using 
OLINDA/EXM (Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment/EXponential Modeling), 
a software based on the Medical Internal Radiation Dose  (MIRD) algorithm, 
which is widely used for established beta and gamma emitting radionuclides. For 
Radium -223, which is primarily an alpha emitter, additional assumptions were 
made for the intestine, red marrow and bone/osteogenic cells to provide the best  
possible absorbed dose calculations for Radium Ra-223 dichloride, considering its 
observed biodistribution and specific characteristics.  For an administered activity 
of 4.00 MBq (0.109 mCi) ((55kBq (.0015  ciper kg body weight to a 73 -kg adult), 
the calcul ated absorbed doses to the bone (osteogenic cells) is 4.2050 Gy (420.5 
rad) and to the red marrow is 0.5066 Gy (50.66 rad). The calculated absorbed 
doses to the main excretory organs are 0.0265 Gy (2.65 rad) for the small intestine 
wall, 0.1180 Gy (11.8 ra d) for the upper large intestine wall and 0.1696 Gy (16.96 
rad) for the lower large intestine wall.  
The calculated absorbed doses to other organs are low, e.g. heart wall (0.0063 Gy, 
0.63 rad), lung (0.0003 Gy, 0.03 rad), liver (0.0109 Gy, 1.09 rad), kidn eys (0.0117 
Gy, 1.17 rad), urinary bladder wall (0.0147 Gy, 1.47 rad), testes (0.0003 Gy, 0.03 
rad), and spleen (0.0003 Gy, 0.03 rad).

 of Radium Ra-223 dichloride. All administrations of Radium Ra-223 dichloride 
are based on the certified activity of Radium Ra-223 dichloride at the calibration 
date.  
 Dose calculation  
 
The dosage of Radium Ra-223 dichloride is 55 kBq  (1.49 mCi )/kg body weight  
(as documented in the written directive) (+/- 10% total dose ). The patient dose is 
calculated based on date of injection, a decay correction (DK) factor  specific to 
number of days from reference date applied to correct for physical decay of  
Radium -223, and patient weight . A table with DK values according to physica l 
decay of the study medication will be provided with every shipment of Radium 
Ra-223 dichloride . Radium -223 is an alpha particle emitter with a physical t1/2 of 
11.4 days.  
 
For example:  If the radioactive  concentration at the reference date is 11,100 
kBq/mL  then t he volume to be administered for the current dose is calculated as 
follows:  
 
Body weight (kg) X dose (55kBQ/kg body weight ) 
DK factor X 1100kBq (0.0297  Ci)/mL  
 Dose preparation  
 
Personnel should use appropriate protective clothing and equipment during 
syringe filling and application to prevent contamination with the radioactive 
solution (medical gloves / protective glasses). The individual responsible for 
study drug preparation will draw the correct volume of study drug into a syringe. 
The size of the syringe should be chosen according to the applied volume to reach 
the required dosing accuracy. Radium Ra-[ADDRESS_433790] ore above 40°C (104°F). If the vials have been 
stored in a refrigerator, they should be left at room temperature for 1 hour prior to 
use, since cold material should not be injected in to a patient.  Store Radium Ra-
223 dichloride in the original container or  equivalent radiation shielding. This 
preparation is approved for use by [CONTACT_349122].

should be instructed to drink ad libitum. Aseptic technique should be used in the 
administration of Radium Ra-223 dichloride. The syringe should be handed over to 
the indiv idual who will perform the injection. The study medication will be 
administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) injection over 1 minute). After administration, the 
equipment used in connection with the preparation and administration of drug is to 
be treated as radioac tive waste and should be disposed in accordance with local

8 TOXICITIES AND DOSEA GE MODIFICATION  
 
This study will utilize the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events) Version 4.0 for adverse event and serious adverse event reporting . A copy of the 
CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded: ( http://safetyprofiler -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/CTC/CTC.aspx ). 
8.[ADDRESS_433794] ment of dose level is not permitted .  
Study visits for administration of Radium -223 during the treatment period should occur at 
28 day  intervals (within a window of 0 and +14  days) . Radium -223 cannot be 
administered earlier than 28 days from the previous administration. Dosing delays may 
be instituted under the following circumstances:  
 
Disease progression:  
The Investigator should delay cytotoxic chemotherapy, other systemic radioisot ope, 
hemibody external radiotherapy or other investigational drug until the follow -up period . 
If such treatments have to be given during the treatment period, further study drug 
administrations must be discontinued .   
 
Patients with a single PSA result tha t meets biochemical progression criteria may 
continue on treatment, at the investigator’s discretion, until a confirmatory PSA result is 
returned. Upon confirmed biochemical progression study treatment MUST be 
discontinued.

 10 CRITERIA FOR EVALUAT ION AND ENDPOINT  
Assessment of clinical outcomes:   
 
Clinical outcomes will be assessed at various time points from the start of protocol 
treatment. Patients will be followed for a total of [ADDRESS_433806] 3 cycles of 
Radium -223 will be considered evaluable.  
10.1 Primary Endpoint – 15 month Hormone Free Survival  
 
The primary objective is t o determine the hormone -therapy -free survival time for men 
treated with sequential EBRT and Radium -223 and determine whether  it is a 20% risk 
reduction over the institutional comparator of 100%  use of systemic therapy by 15 
months.  The primary outcome is 15 month s hormone -free survival . Patients will remain 
on study treatment for the duration defined by [CONTACT_349124] . 
Patients will be followed up to determine the start of ADT  which will be used to measure 
the primary end point .  
 
For the pu rposes of this study, progression will be measured after  the completion of

nadir is < 20ng/ml , biochemical  progression will be defined as a PSA rise greater than 
10% of the PSA nadir.

The following definitions and criteria for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_433807] diameter (LD) ≥ [ADDRESS_433808], MRI, or caliper 
measurements or ≥20 mm with x -ray. 
Non-measurable lesions - all other lesions including small lesions (LD < [ADDRESS_433809], MRI,  or caliper measurements or <20 mm with x -ray). 
 
Documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” Lesions  
 All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as 
target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements 
(either by [CONTACT_349125]). 
 A sum of the LD for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as the reference by [CONTACT_349126].  
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be i dentified as non-target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions 
are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.

required when 2 or more new lesions (compared to baseline or to the end of cycle 3 
assessment) first appear after the first follow -up assessment, i.e., at end of cycle 6 or 
thereafter.  
 
Should new bone lesions be documented at end of cycle 3 but not confirmed at end of 
cycle 6, then end of cycle 3 scan becomes the new baseline and 2 or more new lesions at 
subsequent assessments relative to end of cycle 3 defines bone scan progression.  
 
Stable disease (SD) on bone scan stable disease is defined as the absence of progression. 
Bone scan lesions are considered non -evaluable under RECIST, and thus there can be no 
partial response . Complete response is very rare . Thus, almost all bone scans will be rated 
as NE (no lesions present), SD, or PD.

 13 DATA SUBMISSION SCHE DULE  
The Case Report Forms (CRFs) are a set of (electronic or paper) forms for each patient 
that provides a record of the data generated according to the  protocol . CRF s should be 
created prior to the study being initiated and updated (if applicable) when amendments to 
the protocol are IRB approved . Data capture should be restricted to endpoints and 
relevant patient information required for planned manuscri pts. These forms will be 
completed on an on -going basis during the study . The medical records will be source of 
verification of the data . During the study, the CRFs will be monitored for completeness, 
accuracy, legibility , and attention to detail by a memb er of the Research Compliance 
Office.  The CRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_29517] a member of the study team as 
listed on the Delegation of Duties Log. The data will be reviewed no less than annually 
by [CONTACT_140308] . The I nvestigator will allow the Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee or Research Compliance Office personnel access to the 
patient source documents, clinical supplies dispensing and storage area, and study 
documentation for the above -mentioned purpose . The Inve stigator further agrees to assist 
the site visitors in their activities.

15.3  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is established at Huntsman 
Cancer Institute (HCI) and approved by [CONTACT_349128] -being of pa tients 
enrolled on Inve stigator -Initiated Trials that do not have an outside monitoring 
review . Roles and responsibilities of the DSMC are set forth in the NCI -approved 
plan. The activities of this committee include a quarterly review of adverse events 
including SAEs, important medical events, significant revisions or amendments to the 
protocol, and approval of cohort/dose escalations . If the DSMC and/or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_349109], the study will be stopped and will not be 
resumed until the issues are res olved . The DSMC also reviews and approves audit 
reports generated by [CONTACT_349129].   
All phase II  studies are reviewed by [CONTACT_349130]. This includes a review of all serious adverse events (SAEs) occurr ing in 
patients treated at HCI or its affiliates as well as all grade 3 or greater toxicities for 
patients on treatment and within 30 -day follow -up window (only if possibly, probably , 
or definitely related).  
15.4 Adverse Events / Serious Adverse Events  
This st udy will utilize the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events) Version 4.0 for AE and SAE reporting . An electronic copy of the CTCAE 
Version 4.0 can be downloaded from:

 Adverse Events (AE)  
 
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or 
medical condition occurring after starting the study drug , even if the event is not 
considered to be related to study drug. For the purposes of this study, the terms  toxicity 
and adverse event are used interchangeably. Medical conditions/diseases present before 
starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study 
drug. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require 
therapy.  
 
The collection of all adverse events will begin after the first dose of study treatment and 
end [ADDRESS_433822] study visit (or until new cancer treatment is 
initiated, if sooner) , 
 
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by 
[CONTACT_424], discovered by [CONTACT_349131], or 
detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be colle cted 
and recorded and followed as appropriate.  
 
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105] -directive questioning of the 
patient at each visit or phone contact [CONTACT_61641]. Adverse events also may be 
detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_349132], laboratory test, or other assessments. As far as possible, each 
adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
1. the severity grade based on CTCAE v.4 (grade 1 -5) 
2. its relationship to Radi um-223 or EBRT  (definite, probable, possible, 
unlikely, not related) .  
3. its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)  
4. action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily 
interrupted; study drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse 
event; concomitant medication taken; non -drug therapy given; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  
5. whether it constitutes an SAE  
 
All adverse events will be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in 
study drug treatment as listed in the dose modification section of this protocol (see 
section 8 for guidance). Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its 
resolution  or if patient’s  participation on the study is terminated or otherwise 
disconti nued , and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if 
necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
 
Information about common side effects a lready known about Radium -223 is described in 
the Drug Information (section 3) and the most recent Investigator Brochure. This

 information will be included in the patient informed consent and will be discussed with 
the patient during the study as needed.  
 
All adverse events will be immediately recorded in the patient research chart.  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Information about all serious adverse events will be collected and reco rded in co mpliance 
with all institutional  and government requirements . A seri ous adverse event is an 
undesirable sign, symptom , or medical condition that: 
 is fatal or life -threatening  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the 
patient or may re quire medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above  
 causes congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
o routine treatment or  monitoring of the studied indication, not 
associated with any deterioration in condition (procedures such as 
central line placements, paracentesis, pain control)  
o elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indic ation under study and has not worsened since the 
start of study drug  
o treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling 
any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
o social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_349110]’s general condition  
 
The collection of serious adverse events will begin after the first dose of study treatment 
and end [ADDRESS_433823] study visit  (or until new cancer 
treatment is initiated, if sooner).

15.8 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation (or violation) is any departure from the defined procedures and 
treatment  plans as outlined in the protocol version submitted and previously approved 
by [CONTACT_1201]. Protocol deviations have the potential to place participants at risk and can 
also undermine the scientific integrity of the study thus jeopardizing the justification 
for the research . Protocol deviations are unplanned and unintentional events.  
 
Because some protocol deviations pose no conceivable threat to participant safety or 
scientific integrity, reporting is left to the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_349111] e 
guidelines below. The IRB requires the prompt reporting  of protocol deviations 
which are:  
 Exceptions to eligibility criteria.  
 Intended to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant 
or  
 Harmful (caused harm to participants or others, or  place them at 
increased risk of harm - including physical, psychological, economic, or 
social harm), or  
 Possible serious or continued noncompliance

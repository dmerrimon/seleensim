The CHECK Trial:   
A Comparison of Headache Treatment in the E mergency Department :  
ProChlorperazine  versus  Ketamine    
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
In the emergency department  (ED) , one of the most common  chief complaints is 
headache  [1].   A number of prior studies have demonstrated the efficacy of a variety of 
medications for migraines and other benign headaches  [2].  Some of the options for 
treating these types of headaches include  dopamine antagonists, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], non -steroid anti -
inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), triptans, anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_23698], and ergot derivatives  [2].  
Amongst the available options, dopamine antagonists appear to be  the most effective, 
with multiple studies demonstrating t heir superiority over opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] [3], NSAIDs [4 ], 
triptans [5], a nd anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_23698] [6 ].  The dopamine antagonist that we use most 
frequently, and the one that has the most evidence to support its use for benign 
headaches, is prochlorperazine [5,6,7,8,9,10 ].  Although some data suggest that 
droperidol may be even more e ffective than prochlorperazine [ 11], the current national 
shortage limits its use.     
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_506150] , many patients who present to the ED still have headaches 24 
hours after treatment.  In one study by [CONTACT_37062], 31% of patients still had moderate to 
severe headaches 24 hours after discharg e [12].   Often we resort to opi[INVESTIGATOR_506151]  [13].  
 
Ketamine is a NMDA receptor antagonist t hat has both analges ic and dissociative 
properties  [14].  Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness  of keta mine for 
post-operative pain [15,16], pain in burn patients  [17], and chronic pain [18 ].  New 
studies have also shown ketamine to be useful for acute pain in t he ED by [CONTACT_506154] [19] and intravenous routes  [20].  To our knowledge, there are no prospective 
studies that evaluate the effectiveness of ketami ne for the treatment of benign headaches 
in the ED.    
 
We propose a double blind, randomized control study comparing ketamine to 
prochlorperazine for benign headaches in the ED.   
 
METHODS  
 
Study Design  
This will be a  multicenter, prospective, double -blinded , randomized controlled trial on a 
convenience sample of patients presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of headache.   
Page [ADDRESS_652970]  who is familiar with the study protocol

Exempt from FDA IND#  
This study meets the requirements in 21CFR312.2(b)Exemptions(1) to exclude this study 
drug from registration for FDA IND# .  
 
“21CFR312.2(b)Exemptions(1) The clinical investigation of a drug product that is 
lawfully marketed in the  [LOCATION_002] is exempt from the requirements of this part if all 
of the following apply:  
 
“(i)  The  investigation is not intended to be reported to the FDA as a well -

Study investigators will be compliant with 21CFR312.7  Which prohibits:  
“(a) promotion of an investigational new drug…,  (b) Commercial  distribution of 
an investigational new drug…, (c)  prolonging an investigation…, (d) charging 
for and commercialization of investigational drugs…”  
 
Page [ADDRESS_652971] found that patients presenting to the ED with an undifferenti ated 
headache improve with all the above -described headache medications regardless of 
whether or not the y meet the definition of migraine, tension headache, or another primary 
headache disorder [6,8,10].  Therefore, this study will enroll all patients betw een the ages 
of 18 and 65 who  meet all of the inclusion criteria and  do not meet  any of the  exclusion 
criteria , who present to the ED with a benign headache.   
 
Inclusion Criteria  
Patients who present to the ED with complaint of a headache  with the following criteria:   
➢ Age 18 to 65 years  
➢ Temperature < 100.4 F 
➢ Diastolic blood pressure < 104 mm Hg,  
➢ Normal neurologic exam and normal mental status  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
➢ Pregnant  or breastfeeding . 
➢ Meningeal signs are present  
➢ Acute angle closure glaucoma is suspected.   
➢ Head trauma within the previous two weeks  
➢ Lumbar puncture within the  previous two weeks  
➢ Thunderclap onset of the headache  
➢ Weight more than 150 kg  or less than 40 kg.  
➢ Known allergy to one of the study drugs.  
➢ History of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.  
➢ History of intracranial hypertension.  
➢ Is a prisoner  
➢ Patient de clined informed consent  
➢ Non-English speaking patient.  
➢ Attending provider excludes patient    
➢ Patient received any pain medication prior to enrollment  
 
Written, informed consent will be obtained from each patient.  Consent will include a 
discussion of the risks and benefits.  The risks are the side effects associated with each 
drug.  For compazine, this includes drowsiness, blurred vision, xerostomia, c ongestion, 
nausea, akasthisia, tardive dyskinesia, NMS, and blood dyscrasias.  For ketamine, this 
includes, sialorrhea, nausea/vomiting, elevation in blood pressure or heart rate, 
nystagmus/diplopia, fasciculations, hallucinations, bradycardia or hypotensi on, 
arrythmias, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].    Personal benefits include intended reduction in 
headache  symptoms and the satisfaction that the patient may be assi sting investigators in 
determining a more effective headache  treatment . 
 
Interventions  
After e nrollment, each patient will  randomized either to the standard treatment arm  to 
receive prochlorperazine 10 mg IV along with diphenhydramine 25 mg IV , OR to the 
Page 4 of 7 
CHECK Trial Protocol Version 4 
 study arm to rece ive ketamine 0.3 mg/kg along with ondansetron [ADDRESS_652972] 
the prochlorperazine or ketamine will be administered.  The prochlorperazine or ketamine 
will be diluted in saline so that the total volume is 5 mL , and will be admi nistered over 2 
minutes .  The diphenhydramine will be diluted in saline so that it is 2 mL (the same 
volume as the ondansetron).  Both groups will also receive a [ADDRESS_652973] order will read “ randomized  study 
medication ” (for the ketamine or prochlorperazine) and “randomi zed add -on medication” 
(for the ondansetron or diphenhydramine).  
 
Safety  
After [ADDRESS_652974] will 
unblind the randomization for that individual patient  and the patient will not continue in 
the study . 
 
Reportable Events  
Anticipated side effects are those  listed on the manufacturer ’s package insert and are 
treated as routine non -urgent or non -emergent events are not reportable events.  
 
Adverse Events are those  unanticipated  side effects  that require  interventions or 
anticipated side effects that d o not respond to intervention.  
 
Serious Adverse Events are those side effects that require Advanced Life Support 
measures to control symptoms.  
 
AEs and SAEs will be reported to the IRB within 5 days of the event.  
 
 
Methods of Measurement  
Enrolled p atient s will fill out a brief data collection form to include  age, sex, race, phone 
number, and baseline headache severity using a 100 -mm visual analog  scale (VAS) .  
Repeat headache severity scores will be measured at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes.  Time 
zero begin s immediately after complete administration of the study drug.  Nausea  (with a 
100 m VAS) , vomiting, anxiety, restlessness (akathisia) , heart rate, and blood pressure  
will also be assessed at these time intervals.   The need for rescue medications will be 
extracted from the patient’s chart at a later time.    
 
Trained research assistants will call the patient  24-[ADDRESS_652975]-discharge  by [CONTACT_506155] a scale of 0-10, and to 
Page 5 of 7 
CHECK Trial Protocol Version 4 
 ask if they are curren tly having a headache (yes or no).   If the patient is admitted, the 
patient will be approached in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_506153].      
 
Outcome Measures  
The primary outcome measure will be the difference in pain scores between the 
prochlorperazine and ketamine groups, measured as the absolute difference between the 
means at [ADDRESS_652976] protected computer in the locked Emergency Medicine research 
office.  All research assistants and investigators are HIPAA - trained , CITI trained  and 
credentialed by [CONTACT_278384] , and orient ed to the study protocol.  
 
Data Analysis : 
 
A couple prior studies have used a 25 -mm difference in mean VAS score reduction 
between grou ps to show a clinical benefit [6,9 ].  We define significant  pain relief as an 
absolute decrease in the mean VAS score of 25 mm.   
 
Thirty -two patients will be needed in each group to find a 25 -mm difference between the 
group mean s on the VAS at 60 min, with a power of 0.80 and an  alpha of 0.05.  We will 
aim for 35 patients per group  to account for about a 10% dropout rate .  The groups will 
be compared using a t -test on gender, race, and age; and a chi (with Yates correction) -
squared test on severity of presenting headache, to determine if they are similar .  The 
individual VAS measurements will be compared using a repeated measures analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) test.

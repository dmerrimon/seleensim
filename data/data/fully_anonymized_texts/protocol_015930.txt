Page 4 of 50 FX-322-202 V5.0 8Feb2021  Study Design: This is a Phase 2a, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and repeat-dose, multicenter, exploratory efficacy study of FX-322, administered by [CONTACT_266125], in adults with stable sensorineural hearing loss (no changes in air conduction greater than 10 dB at a single frequency or greater than 5dB at two contiguous frequencies from the prior audiogram to the Screening audiogram).  The study will have 3 phases: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up. Screening:  Can occur up to 30 days prior to study drug administration (Baseline/Treatment Day 1). All subjects will be screened to determine study eligibility. As part of recording the medical history of subjects, concurrent use of hearing aids during the study will be documented.  All subjects will return for the Baseline visit and evaluated to ensure they continue to meet appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria applicable at that visit. Baseline/Treatment: Approximately 96 subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study.  The subjects will be randomized to receive FX-322 or placebo according to the different treatment group schedules listed below: Group Dosing Schedule Treatment Group # of Subjects Day [ADDRESS_323821] has been identified as meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, the qualifying ear with the worse hearing (ear with the worst Screening pure tone average) will be selected, unless a rationale exists to treat the other ear (e.g. the worse hearing ear does not meet the study criteria).  The study treatment or placebo will be administered on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, and Day 21. The placebo will be matched to FX-[ADDRESS_323822]  trained and experienced in performing intratympanic injections. Safety monitoring will include recording of adverse events (AEs), safety laboratory assessments, and monitoring of tympanometry and otoscopic exams. Follow up: Subject will be required to return to clinic for safety, otologic, and audiologic assessments at Days 15, 60, 90, 150, and 210 after the initial injection.  Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_266126] 30, 120, and 180. Number of Subjects:  Approximately 96 evaluable subjects Study Duration: Screening phase: up to [ADDRESS_323823] study drug administration (Baseline Visit). 
 
Page 5 of 50 FX-322-202 V5.0 8Feb2021  Treatment phase: 21 days (4 treatment visits 7 days apart) Follow-up phase: 7 months from Baseline (Day 1).  Study Population: Male and female adults (18 to 65 years inclusive), otherwise healthy with stable sensorineural hearing loss.  Statistical Analysis: Sample Size:  The sample size of approximately 24 subjects per group was considered adequate to explore the potential efficacy of FX-322 associated with various dosing schedules and was not based on formal statistical evaluation. Statistical Methods:  Descriptive summaries will be provided for patient disposition, demographic and baseline disease data.  Summary statistics for efficacy endpoints will be provided for each randomized treatment group  and timepoint.  Comparisons of each FX-322 group to placebo along with 95% confidence intervals of the difference will also be calculated.  Additionally, comparisons among the [ADDRESS_323824] one dose of study drug, will comprise the analysis set for the exploratoration of efficacy.  Additional sensitivity analyses will be conducted using a Per Protocol Analysis Set.  Subjects will be analysed by [CONTACT_266127].   The incidence of  treatment-emergent adverse events will be presented by [CONTACT_266128] (MedDRA®).  Tabulations will be provided by [CONTACT_12917], severity, and relationship to study drug.  Laboratory, tympanometry and otologic data will be presented as summary statistics at each timepoint as well as changes from baseline and/or shift tables.  All subjects exposed to study drug will be included in the Safety Analysis Set and included in the safety analyses according to the actual treatment group regardless of the randomized assignment.   Details of the planned statistical analyses and methods will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which will be finalized prior to database lock and study blind break

 5 INTRODUCTION 
Worldwide, an estimated 1.1 billion people are at risk for hearing loss due to exposure to 
damaging levels of sound (WHO, 2015). The WHO also reported that 16% of the disabling 
hearing loss in adults is attributable to occupational noise exposure (Nelson e t al, 2005). The 
hearing loss population shows higher rates of dementia, depression, and other mental health 
disorders, especially in the elderly (Choi et al, 2016; McGilton et al, 2016; Deal et al, 2016). 
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) accounts for about 90% of all cases of hearing loss (Li et al, 2017). Leading causes include noise exposure, ototoxic medications, advanced age, 
inherited, and autoimmune disorders. Noise is a major occupational and environmental 
hazard, causing hearing loss, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and hypertension (Hong et al, 2013). SNHL has long been recognized as the primary and direct health effect of excessive noise 
exposure (Basner et al, 2015). In the [LOCATION_002], an estimated 48 million people or 20.3% of the population 12 years or older has hearing loss in one or both ears (Lin et al, 2011).  
Excessive sound levels or loud sounds for extended periods time hyperstimulate cochlear hair cells, which can lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative cell  
death. Presently, no curative treatments exist, but rather assistive devices such as hearing aids 
and cochlear implants are used to address the symptoms of SNHL. These options, however, 
do not address the underly biological deficit of SNHL and are not suf ficient for normal 
quality of life in individuals with SNHL. 
FX-322 is a fixed ratio dose combination of two small molecules: a glycogen synthase kinase 
([COMPANY_004]) inhibitor, FX03, and Valproate Sodium (an HDAC inhibitor approved in multiple countries including the US for human use as Depacon®). 
The active ingredients in FX -322 target two cellular mechanisms, histone deacetylase 
(HDAC) inhibition and [COMPANY_004]-[ADDRESS_323837] synergistically to  induce a regenerative 
response in cochlear tissue. The combination of the mechanisms was shown to enable 
Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 positive (Lgr5+) progenitor cells 
to asymmetricly divide to create a copy of themselves an d a daughter cell that can become a 
hair cell (McLean et al, 2017). Thus, FX-[ADDRESS_323838] hair cells. 
In preclinical experiments, a fixed ratio dose combination of FX03 and Valpro ate Sodium 
demonstrates: 
• Expansion of the Lgr5+ progenitor cells and subsequent conversion into hair cells 
using newborn and adult cells. Substantial Lgr5+ cell expansion occurs with the combination of agents but not with the individual agents.  
• Expansion of progenitor cells from adult primate inner ear, and expansion and 
subsequent conversion of progenitor cells into hair cells  from the adult human inner 
ear. 
• Formation of new hair cells in ototoxin damaged mouse cochlear explants . 
• Significant improvement in hearing and hair cell numbers in an adult mouse model of 
noise-induced hearing loss. 
Based on these findings, FX-[ADDRESS_323839] of these trials, FX-322-103, nine patients undergoing 
cochlear implantation surgery received a single unilateral intratympanic injection of FX-322 
(6 patients) or placebo (3 patients) to study tolerability, systemic drug exposure, and cochlear drug exposure.  The results demonstrated acceptable local and systemic acute tolerability and 
very limited systemic exposure that was unmeasurable within [ADDRESS_323840] injection.  In 
addition, the cochlear FX-322 drug concentration data demonstrated the drug was present at 4 
hours after intratympanic injection in one patient but unmeasurable after 24 hours in the 
perilymph in two subjects. 
The second clinical trial was a Phase 1/2  (FX-322-201) randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled single-dose study in adults with stable sensorineural hearing loss .  The objectives of 
this study were to asses s: 1) the systemic safety of two dose levels of FX-322; 2) the plasma 
pharmacokinetic profile of FX-322; and 3) the effect of FX-322 on otologic and audiologic 
measures. After intratympanic injection  of FX-322, there were no serious adverse events 
(SAEs) or AEs that led to a subject withdrawal or death and the most common AEs were 
considered associated with the intratympanic injection procedure.  No clinically significant 
safety issues were observed on otologic or audiologic measures.  Additionally, the systemic 
PK profile of FX-[ADDRESS_323841]-hoc analysis 
showed a statistically significant improvement in WR for patients treated with FX -322 versus 
patients given placebo.  FX-322 patients showed an improvement in WR scores from baseline 
to Day 90. In addition, the FX-322 group showed a clinically meaningful improvement in WIN 
scores from baseline to Day 90 as determined by [CONTACT_266129], 2007 . Four of the FX-
322 patients showed a clinically meaningful improvement in WR according to established 
audiological definitions (Thorton and Raffin, 1978), with two of these patients demonstrating 
WIN improvements that are defined as clinically meaningful (Wilson and McArdle, 2007).   
The notable improvements in these measures of hearing function were generally observed in 
FX-[ADDRESS_323842] observed between the two dose volumes of  FX-322. 
 
6 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
6.1 Known Potential Benefits 
The active ingredients in FX -322 target two cellular mechanisms, histone deacetylase 
(HDAC) inhibition and [COMPANY_004]-[ADDRESS_323843] demonstrated 1) t he ability to induce progenitor cell 
expansion and subsequent conversion into new hair cells across species, including human, 2) restoration of hair cells in ototoxin-damaged mouse cochlear implants , and 3) a significant 
improvement in hearing and hair cell numbers in an adult mouse model of noise-induced 
hearing loss. 
Most recently it has been shown that in humans with stable SNHL, a single intratympanic 
dose of FX-[ADDRESS_323844] been carefully studied in nonclinical toxicology studies, as well as in two separate clinical trials. Based on these studies, the risks appear to be similar to those experienced with intratympanic injections of other materials, such as steroids, that are not FDA-approved. The risks are characterized as persistent eardrum perforation, pain or bleeding with injection, temporary dizziness, middle ear infection, and conductive or sensorineural hearing loss. A published clinical trial using multiple intratympanic injections of a steroid in SSNHL patients has shown the majority of adverse events to be associated with the injection procedure, with eardrum perforations reported at less than 4% (Rauch et al., 2011). 6.3 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits Based on the very low potential for risk, which is primarily associated with the intratympanic injection procedure, compared to the potential benefit which is the possibility of restoration of hearing, the risk/benefit profile is considered acceptable to conduct the study described herein. 7 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 7.1 Primary Objective(s) 1. To assess the exploratory efficacy by [CONTACT_266130]-322 in subjects with stable sensorineural hearing loss. 2. To assess the local and systemic safety of single and repeat doses at of FX-322 in subjects with stable sensorineural hearing loss.  7.2 Endpoints Efficacy Endpoint(s) • Mean changes from Screening in: o Word Recognition in quiet (WR) o Words-In-Noise testing (WIN) o Standard Pure Tone Audiometry (air 0.25-8 kHz; bone 0.5-4 kHz)  Additional Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint(s) • Mean changes from Screening in: o Extended High Frequency Audiometry (air 9-16 kHz) o Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) o Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA) o Hearing Screening Inventory (HSI)   Safety Endpoint(s) • Adverse events  • Changes from Screening in: o Otoscopy o Tympanometry

In a previous human study, Study FX-322-201, it was demonstrated that a single dose FX-[ADDRESS_323845] intratympanic injection. Additionally, FX-322 was shown to be associated with improvements in hearing function in some patients that were considered clinically meaningful, as defined by [CONTACT_266131].  Screening:  Can occur up to 30 days prior to study drug administration (Baseline/Treatment Day 1). All subjects will be screened to determine study eligibility. As part of recording the medical history of subjects, concurrent use of hearing aids will be documented.  All subjects will return for the Baseline visit and evaluated to ensure they continue to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria applicable at that visit.  Baseline/Treatment: Approximately 96 subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study.  The subjects will be randomized to receive FX-322 or placebo according to the different treatment group schedules listed below:  Group Dosing Schedule Treatment Group # of Subjects Day 1 Day 8 Day 15 Day 21 1 24 FX-322 Placebo Placebo Placebo 2 24 FX-322 FX-322 Placebo Placebo 3 24 FX-322 FX-322 FX-322 FX-322 4 24 Placebo Placebo Placebo Placebo  Subjects will be stratified at randomization by [CONTACT_25059] (last assessment before study drug administration Word Recognition (>=50% correct, <50% correct) and etiology of hearing loss (Sudden vs Noise).  Once a subject has been identified as meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, the qualifying ear with the worse hearing (ear with the worst Screening pure tone average) will be selected, unless a rationale exists to treat the other ear.  The study treatment or placebo will be administered on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, and Day 21. The placebo will be matched to FX-[ADDRESS_323846] trained and experienced in performing intratympanic injections.  Safety monitoring will include recording of adverse events (AEs), safety laboratory assessments,  and monitoring of tympanometry and otoscopic exams.  Follow up:  Subjects will be required to return to clinic for safety, otologic, and audiologic assessments at Days 15, 60, 90, 150, and 210 after the initial injection.  Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_266126] 30, 120, and 180. Unscheduled visits may occur as needed.  See the Schedule of Assessments for more information.  8.1.1 Study Design

 8.6.1 Packaging and Labeling 
For the injection, the study drug or placebo will be provided in a kit with 4 study vials 
labelled for each injection (Injection 1, Injection 2, Injection 3, and Injection 4).  The subject 
will be assigned just one kit for all of the study treatments.  The  will be taken from 
general stock at the site.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_266116].  More 
information can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  The study drug and placebo will be 
prepared in a sterile [ADDRESS_323856] be 
warmed in a heating unit. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for further instructions . 
 
The label(s) for the investigational product will include sponsor name, address and telephone number, the protocol number, investigational product name, dosage form, amount of 
investigational product per container, lot number, unique kit number, storage conditions, and 
required caution statements and/or regulatory statements, as applicable. 
 
8.6.[ADDRESS_323857] be stored as indicated in the Pharmacy Manual. Empty vials and containers 
may be destroyed at the conclusion of the study, after the site monitor has performed accountability and in compliance with the site’s SOP.  
8.6.[ADDRESS_323858] or 
other appropriate individual. This individual will not perform any other study procedures 
other than study drug preparation and accountability.  Drug accountability records indicating 
the drug’s delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by [CONTACT_6992], and return (of 
unused vials) to Frequency Therapeutics (or destruction, if approved by [CONTACT_266136]) will be maintained by [CONTACT_977]. These records will adequately document 
that the subjects were provided the doses as specified in the protocol and should reconcile a ll 
study drug received from Frequency Therapeutics or its designee. Accountability records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, and subject identification numbers. The site 
monitor will review drug accountability at the site on an ongoing basis during monitoring visits. 
8.6.[ADDRESS_323859] will be blinded to treatment. The pharmacy staff who 
prepare the study drug will be unblinded and will not perform any other roles on the study 
other than drug preparation and accountability.  The independent statistician and/or 
independent statistical programmer who is not otherwise involved with the study will 
generate the randomization schedule, will be un-blinded, and will perform the Day [ADDRESS_323860]’s treatment group assignment. Under such conditions, the identity of the study drug will be obtained either via the unblinding functionality within the IRT system or  by 
[CONTACT_266137].  
If possible, the Medical Monitor and Frequency Therapeutics should be consulted prior to 
breaking the blind. If the blind is broken for any reason, the Investigator must notify 
Frequency Therapeutics and the Medical Monitor immediately of the un-blinding incident 
without revealing the subject’s study treatment group assignment to Frequency Therapeutics  
and the Medical Monitor. In the event that the treatment group assignment is broken, the date, the signature [CONTACT_266152].  Any code-breaks that occur must be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor.  Any subject whose treatment group assignment has been 
un-blinded will  be followed up for safety purposes.  
 
8.7.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_323861] Recognition Score (>=50% correct, 
<50% correct) and etiology of hearing loss (SSNHL vs. NIHL). 
8.7.4 Selection of Doses in the Study 
In this Phase 2a study (FX-322-202), four intratympanic injections will be administered as 
either placebo or the investigational product FX -[ADDRESS_323862] and consequent improvement in hearing function.  
 The data from Phase 1/[ADDRESS_323863] has been identified who meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, the ear with the 
worse hearing (ear with the worst Screening pure tone average) will be selected, unless a 
rationale exists to treat the other ear.  The Investigator will need to discuss that rationale with 
the Sponsor prior to randomization. Subjects will be administered a total of 4 doses of FX -
322 and/or placebo. Injections will take place on Days 1, 8, 15, and [ADDRESS_323864]'s records and the eCRF. Any changes in doses or introduction of a 
new medication during the course of the study will be recorded.  Any medications taken in the 
14 days prior to the Screening visit will be recorded on the Concomitant Medication log. 
8.8.1 Prohibited Medication/Therapy 
Concomitant medications that are not allowed during the study are valproic acid (brand name 
(e.g. Depacon
®, Depakote®, Depakene, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_266117]®, Valpro, and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_266118]) or derivatives. 
Intratympanic injections of anything other than study medication are prohibited during the course of the study or within [ADDRESS_323865] TO FOLLOW-UP 9.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention Discontinuation from FX-322 does not mean discontinuation from the study, and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE).  The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following: • All efforts will be made for the subject to complete all of the follow up visits. • If the subject does not wish to continue the follow up period, all efforts will be made for the subject to complete all assessments collected at the last follow up visit (see Section 8.4.4).  9.[ADDRESS_323866] to follow-up if he or she fails to return for 2 scheduled visits (or the final visit) and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_136589].   The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: • The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_62541] 5 days and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. • Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record or study file.   Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.  10 TIMING OF STUDY PROCEDURES Subjects will provide written informed consent before any study related procedures are performed.

Additional details can be found in the Audiology Manual of Procedures.   11.1.2 Words-In-Noise Testing (WIN) The Words-in-Noise Test (WIN) was developed as an instrument to quantify the ability of listeners to understand monosyllabic words in background noise using multitalker babble (Wilson, 2003). Materials are recorded at 7 signal-to-noise ratios (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 dB) that are presented in a descending manner. This test is conducted by [CONTACT_1601] [ADDRESS_323870]’s threshold for hearing at various frequencies and will be performed at the Screening visit and Day 15, 60, 90, 150, and 210.  This will be performed on a calibrated audiometer by a licensed audiologist.  The  following frequencies will be obtained:  Air: 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 3 kHz, 4 kHz, 6 kHz, and 8 kHz; Bone: [ADDRESS_323871]’s threshold for hearing at frequencies beyond those in standard pure tone audiometry and will be performed 
 
FX-322-[ADDRESS_323872]. The following frequencies will be obtained: Air – 9 kHz, 10 kHz, 11.2 kHz, 12.4 kHz, 14 kHz, and 16 kHz. 11.2.2 Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) The Tinnitus Functional Index has eight subscales that address the intrusiveness of tinnitus, the sense of control the patient has, cognitive interference, sleep disturbance, auditory issues, relaxation issues, quality of life, and emotional distress.  The subject will report (either directly onto the questionnaire in person, via web, or over the phone) answers to each of the [ADDRESS_323873] to complete at the Baseline, Day 60, Day 120, and Day 210 visits. 11.2.3 Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA) The Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA), is a 25-item self-assessment scale composed of two subscales (emotional and social/situational).

Complete physical examinations include: general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, dentition, thyroid, chest (heart, lungs), abdomen, skin, neurological, extremities, back, neck, musculoskeletal, and lymph nodes and any pertinent system based on any prior findings. Physical examinations may be performed at various unscheduled time points, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737].  12.1.5 Columbia Suicide and Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) This scale is used to determine if any suicide ideation or intention is present.  The questionnaire is read aloud to the subject and responses are recorded by [CONTACT_266138]. If any ideation or intention is present, the Investigator will interview the subject and have them follow up with their primary healthcare provider.  The C-SSRS will be completed at the Baseline, Day 60, Day 120, and Day 210 visits. 12.1.6 Body Mass Index (BMI) BMI will be calculated by [CONTACT_266139]’s body weight in kilograms by [CONTACT_423]’s height in meters squared (BMI = kg/m2). Body height (centimeter) and body weight (kilograms) will be measured at the time points delineated in the Schedule of Assessments.   12.1.[ADDRESS_323876] any abnormalities of the external ear canal, tympanic membrane and middle ear and will be performed at Screening, prior to injection on Day 1, 8, 15, and 21 and at the Day 60, 90, 150, and 210 visits.  12.1.8 Tympanometry Tympanometry (an objective test of tympanic membrane mobility) tests the integrity of the tympanic membrane by [CONTACT_266140]. Middle ear compliance, peak pressure, and tympanogram type will be recorded.  Tympanometry will be performed at the Screening, Day 15, and at the Day 60, 90, 150, and [ADDRESS_323877] a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the medicinal (investigational) product. This includes an exacerbation of pre-existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the eCRF under specific efficacy assessments. Anticipated fluctuations of pre-existing conditions, including the disease under study that do not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs. It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study. AEs will be elicited by [CONTACT_63397] a nonleading question, for example, “Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?”.  AEs will be recorded from the time of the first treatment through the end of the follow up period.  AEs should be reported on the appropriate page of the eCRF.  Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction Definition An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. Assessment of Severity Each AE will be assigned a category by [CONTACT_3470]: Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort and does not interfere with everyday activities. Moderate: An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities; intervention may be needed. Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other intervention usually needed. If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event. Assessment of Causality Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the study drug. Causality should be assessed using the categories presented in the following table: 
 
FX-322-202 V5.0 8Feb2021                                                                                  Page 37 of 50  Not Related: Clinical event with an incompatible time relationship to study drug administration, and that could be explained by [CONTACT_266141]. Unlikely: Clinical event whose time relationship to study drug administration makes a causal connection improbable, but that could plausibly be explained by [CONTACT_91336]. Possible: Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study drug administration, but that could also be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. Related: Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study drug administration and is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Adverse Events of Special Interest (Audiometric and Otoscopic) If any of the following criteria are met, the event will be recorded as an  adverse event of special interest (AESI) per ASHA guidelines (ASHA 1994): • Asymmetric loss of hearing greater than 20 dB at any one frequency in the treated ear compared to the Screening Visit. • Asymmetric loss of hearing greater than 10 dB at two adjacent frequencies in the treated ear compared to the Screening Visit. • Asymmetric loss of response at three consecutive test frequencies where responses were previously obtained in the treated ear compared to the Screening Visit. For word recognition testing, a follow up visit score in the treated ear that falls below the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of the baseline word recognition score will be considered an AESI (Thorton and Raffin 1978). Additionally, if the subject experiences a perforation greater than 25% of the tympanic membrane in the treated ear this will be recorded as an AESI.  If any subjects in the study experience the same AESI, the Medical Monitor will discuss these with the Principal Investigators and each subject’s condition will be discussed.  The Medical Monitor, in consultation with the sponsor, will determine whether to proceed with any future doses if the subjects have not completed all 4 doses. Action Taken with Study Treatment in Response to Adverse Event The investigator will describe the action taken in the appropriate section of the eCRF, as follows: • Dose Increased,  • Dose Not Changed,  • Dose Reduced,  • Drug Interrupted,  • Drug Withdrawn,  
 
FX-322-202 V5.0 8Feb2021                                                                                  Page 38 of 50  • Not Applicable,  • Unknown   Follow-up of Adverse Events All Investigators should follow up subjects with AEs until the event is resolved or until, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the event is stabilized or determined to be chronic. Details of AE resolution must be documented in the eCRF. Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events AEs should be reported and documented in accordance with the procedures outlined below. All AEs occurring during the study (after study treatment has begun) must be documented on the relevant eCRF pages. The following data should be documented for each AE: • Description of the symptom event, or underlying diagnosis • Classification of ‘serious’ or ‘not serious’ • Severity • Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) • Action taken (see definitions above) • Causal relationship • Outcome of event (unknown, recovered, not yet recovered, recovering/resolving, recovered with sequelae, deaths[with date and cause reported]) 13.[ADDRESS_323878] that, at any dose, • Results in death. • Is life-threatening (an AE is life-threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form). • Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. (Complications occurring during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68430]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing non--worsening condition is not, however, considered an AE. The details of such hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266119]). • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. (An AE is incapacitating or disabling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions). • Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. In addition, medical and scientific judgement is required to decide if prompt notification is required in situations other than those defined for SAEs above. This may include any event that the Investigator regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but may have jeopardized the subject or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
 
FX-322-[ADDRESS_323879] details of the Medical Monitor 
can be found in the Site Operation Manual. 
The Investigator should not wait to receive additional information to document fully the 
event before notification of a SAE, though additional information may be requested . 
Information from relevant laboratory results, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63337] , and autopsy reports 
should be obtained. 
Instances of death, congenital abnormality , or an event that is of such clinical concern as to 
influence the overall assessment of safety, if brought to the attention of the investigator at any 
time after cessation of study drug administration and linked by [CONTACT_63402], 
should be reported to the study monitor. 
The sponsor and/or CRO will promptly notify all relevant investigators and the regulatory 
authorities of findings that could adversely affect the safety of subjects, impact on the 
conduct of the study or alter the independent ethics committee (IEC)/institutional review 
board (IRB) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_23748]. In addition, CRO on behalf of the 
sponsor, will expedite the reporting to all concerned investigators, to the IRBs, where 
required, and to the regulatory authorities of all adverse reactions that a re both serious and 
unexpected. 
Details of the procedures to be followed if a pregnancy occurs are provid ed in Section 8.4.4. 
13.2 Expedited Safety Reporting  
All serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be the subject of 
expedited reporting. The sponsor and/CRO shall ensure that all relevant information about a 
S[LOCATION_003]R that is fatal or life-threatening is reported to the regulatory authorities  and IRB 
within [ADDRESS_323880] be reported by t he 
investigator to the sponsor.

The primary objectives of the study are to explore the efficacy of FX-322 associated with various dosing schedules and to describe the local and systemic safety.   Subjects will be randomized to one of four treatment groups using a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio.   Subjects will be stratified at randomization by [CONTACT_25059] (last assessment before study drug administration Word Recognition (above and below 50% correct) and etiology of hearing loss (Sudden vs Noise).  For the analysis, baseline will be defined as the last measurement prior to the first exposure to study drug.  The exploration of efficacy will be descriptive as well as analytical to describe dose response trends among the four treatment groups (three FX-322 dosing schedules and placebo).  Additional analyses will include comparisons of each individual FX-322 to placebo and between the three FX-322 groups as well as the pooled FX-322 group to placebo.  These analyses will examine each timepoint and explore the longitudinal aspects of the study design.    Safety will be analysed descriptively.    Study data will also be provided in line listings.  Details of the statistical analysis will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which will be finalized prior to database lock and study blind break.  14.1.2 Sample Size The sample size of approximately 24 subjects per treatment group was considered adequate to explore the potential efficacy of FX-322 associated with various dosing schedules and was not based on formal statistical evaluation.   14.1.3 Analysis Sets • Full Analysis Set (FAS)  The Full Analysis Set is defined as all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.  Subjects will be analysed according to their randomized treatment group.  The FAS will be used to explore efficacy.  Details will be provided in the SAP.  • Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS)  
 
FX-322-202 V5.0 8Feb2021                                                                                  Page 41 of 50  The Per Protocol Analysis Set is defined as subjects receiving all four doses of study drug or placebo and without major protocol deviations that could interfere with interpretation of the results.  These major protocol deviations will be identified prior to breaking the study blind.  If different from the FAS, the PPAS may be used in additional sensitivity analyses.  PPAS subjects will be analysed according to their randomized treatment group.  Details will be provided in the SAP.    • Safety Analysis Set (SfAS)  The Safety Analysis Set will include all subjects exposed to study drug or placebo and will be analyzed according to the actual treatment group regardless of their randomized treatment assignment.  The SfAS  will be used for the analysis of safety.  Both the treated and untreated ear will be included in the SfAS when the ear is the unit of the safety analysis.     14.1.[ADDRESS_323881] deviations, minimums and maximum will be provided.  For categorical endpoints the number and percent of subjects within each category will be calculated.  Tabulations for selected endpoints will be presented by [CONTACT_215612], study site, duration of hearing loss, smoking status, and stratification factors used at randomization.  Details will be provided in the SAP.  For descriptive analyses, subjects with missing data will be excluded for a particular calculation. For questionnaires, the analysis will follow the instructions for scoring and handling of missing data appropriate for the particular instrument. Inferential statistical methods examining continuous endpoints will be examined via a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM).  Analyses will include pairwise contrasts and dose response.  Inferential analyses for categorical endpoints will be analysed using univariate methods and/or Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM).  When appropriate, models will include adjustments for baseline as well as the stratification factors used at randomization.  Departures of these models from the statistical assumptions will be assessed and alternative approaches maybe employed.  Additionally, univariate models such as Analysis of Covariance and/or count models examining single timepoints of interest may also be examined. General methods for handling missing data for inferential analyses are described below (Section 14.2).  The inferential analyses will not be adjusted for multiple endpoints; however, for a given endpoint, adjusted p-values for pairwise comparisons to a control will be provided where

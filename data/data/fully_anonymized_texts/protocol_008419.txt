reported to the IRB as soon as possible.  
 
Investigational Agent and D osing  
 
 Memantine 10mg to 20mg po qday  
 
Population  
 
 The population to be studied for this trial is 100 men and women ages ≥[ADDRESS_266215] a current DSM -5 diagnosis of trichotillomania or skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221614] (i.e.  a body focused 
repetitive behavior (BFRB)).  
 
Project Goals  
 
 The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of memantine in 100 
subjects with DSM -5 trichotillomania or skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221614].  Subjects will receive 8 weeks of 
double -blind memantine or placebo. The hypothesis to be tested is that memantine will be 
effective and well tolerated in patients with BFRBs compared to placebo. The proposed study 
will provide needed data on the treatment of disabling disorders that curre ntly lack a clearly 
effective treatment.  
 
Background  
 
Hair pulling disorder (i.e. trichotillomania) and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221615] (BFRB) disorders. 
These repetitive, intentiona lly performed behaviors often cause noticeable cosmetic issues and 
may result in clinically significant distress or functional impairment (1 -3). Although discussed in 
the medical literature for over one hundred years, and affecting all strata of society, t here are no 
clear treatment approaches for people with these disorders (4). Behavioral therapy is generally 
regarded as the first -line treatment but trained therapi[INVESTIGATOR_221616]. In addition, there is 
no medication currently approved by [CONTACT_39261] d and Drug Administration for these disorders.  
It appears that trichotillomania and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221617] a common 
neurobiology which involves an excess of activation in the mesocorticolimbic area and a lack of 
top-down cortical control governing response suppression. The potential effectiveness of 
memantine in BFRBs may be via its antagonism of the NMDA receptors in the striatum (5 -6) 
and its potential to improve aspects of cognition by [CONTACT_221648] c ortex.  
3 
 Recent stud ies using diffusion tensor imaging demonstrated that both trichotillomania 
and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221618], pre -supplementary motor area, and temporal cortices ( 7-8). These data suggest that the 
disorganization of white matter tracts in motor habit generation and suppression may underlie the 
pathophysiology of the se disorder s (7-8). Neurochemically, motor habits may rely partially on 
the glutamate systems . Glutamatergic  dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
these disorders  (9-10). Pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as memantine , that target excessive 
glutamatergic drive may, therefore, be expected to correct the underlying pathophysiology and 
symptoms of BFRBs .  
Given the serious personal consequences associated with trichotillomania and skin 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_221614], and the likelihood of success of memantine in treating both disorders, the aim 
of the present study was to examine the efficacy and safety of memantine vs placebo in adults 
with trichotillomania or skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221619] a double -blind, placebo -controlled design.  
 
We hypothesize that memantine will be more effective than placebo in reducing the 
frequency of hair pulling and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221620] 8 weeks of treatment when compared to baseline.  
 
Primary Aim/Objective  
 
The aim of the present study is to examine the efficacy and safety of memantine vs 
placebo in adults with trichotillomania and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221621]. 
 
Primary Endpoint(s):  
The primary efficacy measure will be the change in hair pulling or skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221622]  (for TTM or Skin Pi[INVESTIGATOR_41875] )(11).  The primary efficacy end points 
will be the change in these measures from baseline to week 8.  
 
Secondary Aim/Objective  
 
A secondary aim of the study is to examine the effects of memantine vs placebo on self -
report measures of hair pulling, skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_41875], quality of life, and measures of mood and anxiety.  
 
Secondary Endpoint(s):  
Secondary efficacy measures include the change in number of days per week 
pulling/pi[INVESTIGATOR_41875], the Clinical Global Impressions –Improvement Scale  (CGI -I) rated global 
improvement of symptoms over time (results will be dichotomized as improved [CGI -I ratings of 
1 or 2 very much/much improved] or not improved [CGI -I ratings of 3 -7]) (12), the self -report  
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221623] (13), the Skin Pi[INVESTIGATOR_221624] (14), the Quality of Life Inventory (15), the Sheehan Disability Scale (16), the Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale (17), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (18), the Tridimensional 
Personality Questionnaire (19), the Autism Spectrum Quotient (20), and the Barratt 
Impulsiveness Scale (21) .

Methodology  
 
100 individuals with trichotillomania or skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221625] a 
double -blind, placebo -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_221626] a 
1:[ADDRESS_266216] trichotillomania or skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221627] -5 
criteria. Following baseline measures, all subjects will be randomized to either memantine or 
placebo and seen every 2 weeks for the 8-week study period .  
 
Participants will be started at 10mg po qday for 2 weeks, then 20mg po qday  for the 
remaining 6 weeks. Participants will only go up to the full dose if clinically needed. Efficacy and 
safety measures will be performed at each visit.   
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on 
Harmonization Gu ideline for Good Clinical Practice, all local ethical and legal requirements, and 
the World Medical Assembly (Declaration of Helsinki). The study protocol and procedures will 
be approved by [CONTACT_161615]’s institutional review board prior to an y recruitment. 
Written informed consent will be required for study participation.  
 
 Randomization of drug will be conducted in blocks of eight, with [ADDRESS_266217] will not know 
what arm of the study they are on otherwise. The investigational pharmacy will follow proper 
accountability procedures in regards to both randomization of the study drug and holding of the 
blind.

3) Ability to understand and sign the consent form.  
. 
 Exclusion criteria :  
1) Unstable medical illness based on history or clinically significant abnormalities on 
baseline physical examination  
2) Current pregnancy or lactation, or inadequate contraception in women of childbearing 
potential  
3) Subjects considered an immediate sui cide risk based on the Columbia Suicide Severity

 8) Cognitive impairment that interferes with the capacity to understand and self -
administer medi cation or provide written informed consent  
 
Baseline Assessments:   
Those subjects who appear appropriate for the study, based on telephone screening, will 
be invited for a baseline assessment. The duration of the baseline assessment will be 
approximately 90 minutes and will include the following: informed consent, demographic data, 
concomitant medications, and family history data. There will also be a physical examination 
(including weight, and vital signs, urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing ye ars and 
urine drug screen). Finally, the subjects will undergo a psychiatric evaluation (using the MINI 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview).  
In addition, the following instruments will be completed at the screening visit: 1) NIMH 
Trichotillomania Sym ptom Severity Scale  (or the same scale modified for skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_41875]) ; 2) 
Sheehan Disability Scale; 3) [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221628]; 4) the 17 -item 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM -D); 5) the 17 -item Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Anxie ty (HAM -A); 6) Clinical Global Impression (Improvement and Severity) scale; 7) 
Cambridge Caffeine Use Questionnaire; 8) The Dietary Fat and Free Sugar Questionnaire and 9) 
the Quality of Life Inventory ; 10) Cambridge -Chicago Trait Scale  (12); 11) the Skin Pi[INVESTIGATOR_221629] (SP -SAS) ; 12) the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ -10); and the 
Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) . In addition, subjects will undergo cognitive assessments at 
baseline and study endpoint.  
Cognitive Assessments:  Assessments of cognitive control will be comprised of  several valid 
paradigms (See below ). These tasks are designed to probe dissociable neural circuitry and 
cognitive processes likely to be implicated in the pathophysiology of addictions. Task o rder was 
chosen arbitrari ly and will be applied consistently across subjects, to minimize possible 
confounding factors of differences in task order across participants.  
 The following tasks will be administered at baseline and final visits:  
  -Stop Signal Task of Inhibitory Control (SST)  
  -Intra-dimensional/Extra -dimensional Set Shift Task (ID/ED task)  
  -One Touch Stockings Task (OTS)  
  -Rapid Visual Processing Task (RVP)  
  -Spatial Working Memory Task (SWM)  
  -Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT)  
 
Following -Up Visit Assessments  
All follow -up visits will include all psychiatric measures (except the MINI which will be 
done at baseline only) and safety measures (adverse events, vital signs, C -SSRS).  There will be 
four follow up visits for a total of fi ve visits.  
 
Subject Compensation  
Subjects will be compensated  $20 per visit, for a total of $100. Compensation will be given in 
the form of a check at the end of the study, as per University of Chicago protocol.  
 
Safety Assessments  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed using spontaneously reported adverse events data, 
Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS ), vital signs, and by [CONTACT_221649] 
6 
 termination. Safety assessments (C -SSRS, sitting blood pressure, heart rate, adverse effects, and 
concomitant medications) will be documented at each visit. Subjects who are an immediate 
suicide risk will be removed from the study and appropriate clinical intervention (e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be arranged. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at th e initial visit. 
Subjects who have a positive urine pregnancy test will be excluded from the study. Assessment 
of side effects will be done at each visit. AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary fo r Regulatory Activities (Med - DRA) 
Version11.1. The incidences of all AEs will be summarized descriptively.  In terms of vital signs, 
those subjects with abnormal blood pressures will be assessed for symptoms of hypo - or 
hypertension. Asymptomatic subjects will be evaluated each visit for changes in vital signs. In 
the case of hypertensive emergencies (BP greate r than 210/120), appropriate referral to the 
emergency room will be made. In the case of hypotension (BP less than 90/60), participants will 
be evaluated for symptoms of hypotension and if symptomatic, appropriate interventions will be 
made.  
 
Subject Withd rawal  
If a subject withdraws from the study, all instruments administered at the screening visit 
will be completed at the final visit.  These will be conducted when the subject is able to come in 
for an early termination visit.  Withdrawn subjects will be given the phone number of the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_221630].

Monitoring Committee  
We will establish a monitoring committee and define in detail its role, its com position, and its 
operating procedures for reviewing patient safety and data from this study.  The monitoring 
committee , comprised of three  individuals independent of personnel involved in the study, 
[ADDRESS_266218] s and a statistician, will come together via conference call yearly. The 
committee will use a standardized approach employing contemporary bio statistical, 
psychiatric/psychological, and ethical principles to review study design and interim data every 
year. The committee will audit the r ecords from the study and will ensure the data are being 
collected, managed and protected. The committee will have the ability to ask for more frequent 
reviews at any time if they deem it necessary. In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_221635].  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_58601] a specific report for the committee in advance of each meeting. Attention 
will be given to data quality and timeliness, recruitment, risk versus benefit, adverse events and 
other factors that could affect study outco me.  
3. Reporting Adverse Events  
• Any serious adverse event will be reported to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) at the University of Chicago in a full written report within 10 working days 
of the event. For fatal/life -threatening serious adverse events, t he PI [INVESTIGATOR_221636].  
• Any moderate adverse event which appears definitely, probably, or possibly 
related to study participation will be reported to the University of Chicago IRB in 
writing within 20 working days.  
• Any mild ad verse event will be summarized in the IRB annual progress reports.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
 
Design/Randomization  
The study is a double -blind, placebo -controlled study.  Participants will be randomized (1:1) to 
receive memantine  or placebo by [CONTACT_221650], using computer -generated randomization with no clinical information.  
 
Due to the pandemic of COVID19, study participants can perform their baseline and follow -up 
visits online using encrypted Zoom instead of in person visits. All inventories will be assessed. 
Blood samples and urine toxicology, however, will be at the discretion of the study PI. In cases 
where they are considered medically necessary, the participant can have them drawn locally and 
submitted to the study team.  
 
Efficacy Analysis  
For statistical analysis, the full -analysis set will be defined as all participants who took at least [ADDRESS_266219]-randomization safety assessment.  Participants with 
trichotillomania and skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221637].  
 
We will compare the baseline characteristics of both groups using Fisher’s exact test for 
categorical variables and the t test for continuous variables. We will calculate adherence to 
treatment, based on the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_221638], as the number of  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_221639] × 100%.  
 
Primary endpoint analysis  
[ADDRESS_266220] randomization visit to study 
endpoint in total composite score on the NIMH Trichotillomania /Skin Pi[INVESTIGATOR_221640] .  
 
The primary analysis of efficacy for continuous measures will be analysis of variance (ANOVA), 
with terms for treatment  to assess differences between treatment groups in the change from  first 
randomization visit  to endpoint using the last observation carried forward. The primary  analysis 
for global improvement and response categories will be the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test using 
the last observation carried forward. The primary analysis for ≥5% reduction in weight will be 
Fisher’s exact test using the last observation carried for ward.  
 
Secondary endpoints analyses  
Secondary outcome measures will include the change from first randomization visit to study 
endpoint in CGI severity and improvement scales, self -reported hair pulling behavior using the 
MGH -HPS, self-reported skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_221641]-SAS,  the change in depressive and 
anxiety symptoms, change in quality of life, and impacts on personality markers. We wil l use a 
longitudinal analysis comparing the rate of change of the outcome during the treatment period 
between groups. The difference in rate of change will be estimated by [CONTACT_221651].  The model for the mean of the outcome will include terms for treatment, time, and 
treatment -by-time interaction. To account for the correlation of observations within  participants, 
we will use SAS procedure MIXED with a first -order antedependence covariance structure. The 
longitudinal analyses will use all available observations from all time points from all participants 
who completed a randomization visit evaluati on.  
 
Safety analyses  
We will evaluate differences between groups in the incidence of treatment -emergent adverse 
events using Fisher’s exact test. Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate changes in 
laboratory values, blood pressure and heart rate.  
 
Sample Size  
The sample size was calculated for the primary endpoint of change from randomization . For 80% 
power to compare the change from randomization , assuming a true effect size of 0. [ADDRESS_266221] of demographic data, subjective (self -report questionnaires, interview 
responses, ratings), and physiological (weight, heart rate and blood pressure). Access to 
individually identifiable private information about human subjects will be limited to [CONTACT_126825] 
and their staff and will be collected specifically for the proposed research project. All collected 
data will be stored utilizing a [ADDRESS_266222] been estimated to be 
approximately 3:1 (female:male).   We will also make every effort to include a racially/ethnically 
9 
 diverse study population. The y ear 2010 Chicago census is 2,695,598 (US Census Bureau, 2011). 
The year 2010 Chicago race distribution is as follows: white 47.1%, African/African -American 
33.9%, Asian/Asian -American 6.2%, Native American 1.0%, or other race/not identified 
(11.8%). A tota l of 28.9% of the population also identified as Hispanic/Latino allowing for a 
diverse population sample (year 2010, US Census Bureau, Chicago, IL). We will make every 
effort to ensure that members of both genders and diverse racial, ethnic, and socioecono mic 
groups are adequately represented in the proposed study.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_161599]: A number of elements of the research plan are intended to 
minimize the ri sks of study participation. For example, the study exclusion criteria exclude 
patients who are experiencing clinically significant suicidality or require a higher level of care 
than outpatient. If this is indicated, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_221642] -
study treatment (for example, inpatient or additional pharmacologic treatment).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_221643]; any participant endorsing suic idal thoughts, will be immediately 
evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_161602] a higher level of care if clinically indicated. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_221644], as 
such issues arise.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_221645] a written report summarizing any decisions that are made 
pertaining to participant disposition.  
 
 
Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (FDA regulations 21 CFR 312 for IND studies and FDA guidance E6) for all studies.  
Applicable government regulations and University of Chicago  research polic ies and procedures 
will also be followed.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to the University of Chicago  Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) for formal approval to conduct the study.  The decision of the IRB 
concerning the conduct of the stu dy will be made in writing to the investigator.   
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing 
sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this 
study.  Th is consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_5040].  The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, will be obtained 
before that subject is submitted to any study procedure.  This consent form must  be signed by [CONTACT_2251] -designated research professional obtaining the consent.

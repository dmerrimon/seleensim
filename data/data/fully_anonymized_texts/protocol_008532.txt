The primary end point of the study is to assess Progression Free Survival (PFS) by [CONTACT_393] 
1.1. However it is well recognized that patients on immune check point inhibitors may 
experience pseudo -progression or can have delayed response. Therefore patie nts who do not 
have development of significant signs or symptoms of progression or significant decline in 
performance status or the patient/the treating physician feel the need to start next treatment, 
will require evidence of progression on [ADDRESS_585685] 
defined PFS and this modified PFS  will be reported for all patients enrolled on the trial.

4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONA LE 
4.1 Background  
Small Cell Lung Ca ncer (SCLC)  
Of the over 225,000 patients diagnosed with lung cancer each year, 13% or about 
30,[ADDRESS_585688] SCLC (1). Approximately 66% of the patients have advanced 
stage disease at the time of diagnosis. The current standard of care treatment for th ese 
patients is the chemotherapy combination of a platinum agent and etoposide (2). The 
median survival with this therapy is only about 10 months, with a progression free 
survival (PFS) of about [ADDRESS_585689] therapy for SCLC patients (3,4,5). It is important to 
note that in these maintenance trials the median PFS following disease 
stabilization  with initial chemotherapy is consistently about [ADDRESS_585690] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformatio n has been known for decades (6) .  Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and 
favorable prognosis in various ma lignancies (7,8 ,9).  In particular, the presence of 
CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems 
to correlate with improved prognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_585691] hijacked by [CONTACT_70710]  (10,11,12,13) .  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on 
the cell surface of activated T -cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate 
unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -[ADDRESS_585692]:   MK-3475   7

Confidential  Limited Access   
(encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -
4 which has been shown to negatively regulate  antigen receptor signaling upon 
engagement of its lig ands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) (10,11) .  PD -1 was shown to be 
expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -
cells, T regs a nd Natural Killer cells .  Expression has also bee n shown during thymic 
development on CD4 -CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of 
macr ophages and dendritic cells  (14).  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including  non-
hematopoietic tissues as well as in  various tumors (12, 13) .  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_585693] notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen -
presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -
L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 
serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell fun ction in peripheral tissues .  Although healthy 
organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express 
abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathwa y 
plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive 
target for therapeutic intervention.  
4.2.1  MK-3475  (Pembrolizumab ) 
MK-3475 (previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly selective 
humanized monoclonal ant ibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly 
block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2 (15). This 
blockade enhances functional activity of the target lymphocytes to facilitate tumor 
regression and ultimately immune r ejection.   
 
[COMPANY_006] is studying MK -3475 for various oncology indications. Protocol 001 (PN001), 
an open -label Phase I study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical 
activity of  MK-3475 when administered as monotherapy  (Investigator’s Brochure) . The 
dose escalation portion of this study  evaluated three dose levels of single agent MK -
3475 (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg),  in patients with advanced solid tumors. All 
three dose levels were well tolerated and no  dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were 
observed, therefore the maximum tolerated dose  (MTD) has not been determined. 
Many other trials are ongoing in various tumors types. In addition trials are evaluating 
the addition of MK -3475 to chemotherapy, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_458493].  
 
MK-3475 strongly enhances T -lymphocyte immune responses in cultured blood cells 
from healthy human donors, cancer patients, and primates  (Investigator’s Brochure) . In 
T-cell activation assays using human donor blood cells, the EC50 (concentration where 
50% of  the maximum effect is achieved) has been ~0.1 to 0.3 nM. In addition to 
interleukin -2 (IL -2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interferon gamma (IFN ), and 
levels of other cytokines were found to be modulated by [CONTACT_90338] -3475. The antibody 
potentiates existi ng immune responses only in the presence of antigen and does not 
nonspecifically activate T -cells. Using an anti -murine PD -[ADDRESS_585694]:   MK-3475   8

with chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine and 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and 
combination therapy results in increased complete tumor regression rates in vivo.  
 
As of [ADDRESS_585695] b een 789 patients treated in a phase I trial  (PN001)  with 
MK-3475 as a 30 -minute IV infusion. Of these 789 patients, preliminary data are 
available  from 479 patients. Based upon  this safety database consisting of patients 
treated up to 10 mg/kg once every t wo to three  weeks, MK -3475 has been generally 
well-tolerated at doses up to 10 mg/kg every other  week without DLTs. One (0.002%) 
patient assayed to date had samples confirmed  positive for ADA, but no impact on 
safety has been observed. Five other clinical studies  (PN002, PN006, PN010, PN011, 
and PN012) are ongoing however preliminary data  analyses are not yet available .  
 
MK-[ADDRESS_585696] dose at 1, 
3 and  10 mg/kg IV of MK -3475 administered to 17 p atients with solid tumors. 
Exposure to MK -3475 is approximately linear in the dose range of clinical relevance 
(1-10 mg/kg). The observed pharmacokinetic profile of MK -3475 was typi[INVESTIGATOR_458494] a half -life (t½) of approximately 2 to 3 weeks. T here was no indication 
of dose dependency of half -life in the 3 dose groups and a dose related increase in 
exposure was observed from 1 to 10 mg/kg. The long half -life supports a dosing 
interval of every 2 or 3 weeks. Exposure obtained with sparse sampling  after dosing 
melanoma and non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients at 2 and 10 mg/kg, every [ADDRESS_585697] been reported in patients with melanoma and NSCLC  
(15, 16) . Adverse events hav e generally been manageable and infrequently require 
discontinuation of MK -3475 treatment.  MK-3475 phase I trial enrolled 207 patients 
with NSCLC who experienced progression of cancer after previous  systemic therapy. 
The preliminary objective response rate  (ORR) by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 is 23 % (95% CI 1 6%, 
30%) in patients with tumors deemed to be PD -L1 positive and 9% (95% CI 2%, 23%) 
in patients with tumors that were PD -L1 negative, for an overall response rate of about 
17%. The median response duration is [ADDRESS_585698] 
higher levels of PD -L1 expression are ass ociated with increased activity. A dditional 
data are  required to define the optimal PD -L1 cut point.  
 
The safety of MK -3475 was characterized in the 1 -month repeat -dose toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys when administered as IV doses of 6, 40 or 200 mg/kg once a 
week  (a total of five doses) and in the 6 -month repeat -dose toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys when administered as IV doses of 6, 40 or 200 mg/kg every other 
week (a total of 12 doses). MK -[ADDRESS_585699]:   MK-3475   9

systemic exposure (AUC) of up  to approximately 170,000 μg.day/mL over the course 
of the 1 -month study, and with a systemic exposure (AUC) of up to approximately 
67,500 μg.day/mL over the course of the 6 -month study. No findings of toxicological 
significance were observed in either 1 -month or 6 -month toxicity s tudy with MK -3475 
and the NOAEL was ≥200 mg/kg. In addition, no findings of toxicological relevance 
were observed in the in vitro tissue cross -reactivity study using human and cynomolgus 
monkey tissues. There were no nonclinical findings that would preclud e testing of MK -
3475 in clinical trials.  
 
Out of a total of 479 patients treated on the phase I trial, 466 (97.3%) experienced 
treatment emergent AEs of which 368 (76.8%) were considered drug -related. SAEs 
were reported in 30.1% of patients, but SAEs that  were attributed as potentially 
(possibly, probably, or definitely) drug -related by [CONTACT_458526] 6.7% 
of patients overall. Five patients died within [ADDRESS_585700] dose of MK -3475; none 
of the deaths were considered drug -related.  Some of the common adverse events were 
fatigue, pruritus, nausea, diarrhea, cough, dyspnea, skin rash, muscle cramps, fever, 
hypo or hyperthyroidism, flu like symptoms, neutropenia.  
 
An important concern with a drug like MK -[ADDRESS_585701] an 
immune etiology. These include rash, vitiligo, hypothyroidism, colitis, hepatitis, 
adrenal insufficiency and pneumonitis. All these AEs were observed in less than 5% of 
the patients.  
The most common drug related ≥ grade 3 AEs were fatigue, diarrhea, liver enzyme 
elevation. All these AEs were observed in less than 2 % of the patients. So me of the 
other ≥ grade [ADDRESS_585702] a longe r survival (17,18,19 ). In addition, it has been observed that patients, 
with tumors that have a higher ratio of effector T cells to regulatory T cells, have better 
outcomes and are more likely to have limited stage disease (20 ). Recent data also shows 
that lung cancer, both small cell and non -small cell lung cancers h ave a high rate of 
mutations (21 ). This high rate of mutations raises the possibility that there are many 
neo-antigens expressed on tumor cells, that are not expressed on normal cells and these 
antigens could serve as targets for the immune cells. All these observations raise the 
strong possibility that activation of an anti -tumor immune response may control and 
even shrink small cell lung cancer.   
 
Multiple different immune based strategies have been evaluated in SCLC  patients. 
These include vaccines, immune response modifiers and immune check point

inhibitors. An anti -idiotypic antibody BEC2 administered with BCG as an adjuvant has 
been tested in SCLC patients (22 ). This antibody mimics the ganglisoide GD3 
expressed i n a large proportion of SCLCs and therefore can induce anti -tumor 
immunity targeting GD -3. In a [ADDRESS_585703] relapse free survival. A 
subsequent phase II I study in limited stage SCLC patients following completion of 
therapy fai led to show clinical benefit (23 ). However the study showed that there was a 
trend towards improved survival in one -third of the patients who developed a humoral 
response. These data  suggest that effective immune therapy could provide clinical 
benefit in SCLC patients when administered as maintenance therapy.   
 
Recently, Reck, et al, published the results of a randomized three arm phase II trial 
evaluating the addition of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_458495] (24 ). Iplimumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA -4, a negative 
regulator of T -cell activation. Patients in this study received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_458496] w as started after the first 2 cycles. Patients on 
the control arm received placebo with chemotherapy. In this study the patients who 
received Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a phased in fashion (after the first 2 cycles) had a significantly 
higher ir (immune related) PFS com pared to patients on the control arm. It is well 
recognized that patients on immune check point inhibitors may experience ‘pseudo’ 
progression probably due to inflammation in the region of the cancer and can have a 
delayed response to therapy. Therefore in  many immune therapy trials modified 
response criteria are utilized to assess progression free survival (ir response criteria).  
Significant improvement in irPFS was not observed in the patients who received 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_458497]. Also improvement in 
RECIST defined PFS was not observed. Interestingly, patients who received 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a phased in fashion had improved survival, with a median of 12.9 
months compared to patients who received chemotherapy alone, with a media n of 9.9 
month. Similar results were observed with this agent in NSCLC patients (25 ). It is 
unclear why clinical benefit was only observed in patients who received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] 
a phased in fashion. The possible reasons are that the cytotoxic effect of che motherapy 
may release tumor antigens into the general system priming the effect of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_458498].  A randomized phase III study evaluating phased i n 
iplimumab in combination with chemotherapy has completed enrollment.   
 
In preliminary clinical studies utilizing anti-PD-1 antibodies promising anti -tumor 
activity has been observed in patients with different tumor types including non -small 
cell lung cancer (16 , 26). In addition, initial trials suggest that these drugs maybe better 
tolerated than anti -CTLA4 antibodies since a nti-CTL4 antibodies generate more 
systemic activation of T cells and anti -PD-1 generate more tissue based activation of 
immune T cells  (27).  
Currently there is no data available regarding the use of anti -PD-[ADDRESS_585704]:   MK-3475   11

Confidential  Limited Access   
who are smokers (28 ). This is possibly related to higher rate of genetic alterations in 
smoking related NSCLCs and therefore higher expression  of antigens on these tumors 
(21). Almost all patients with SCLC are smokers and generally have a prolonged 
history of smoking, making it likely that patients with these tumors will benefit from 
targeting PD -[ADDRESS_585705]  not changed from over 20 years. The 
characteristic features of this cancer are high initial response rate followed by [CONTACT_458527]/relapse of the tumor. Therefore this is an ideal tumor to consider 
maintenance therapy. It is challenging to continue t herapy with currently available 
chemotherapy drugs. Therefore it is imperative to evaluate other agents as maintenance 
therapy with the goal of prolonging disease control and possibly survival . There is 
indirect evidence that immune therapy may be benefici al in SCLC patients.    
Based on all the discussed data, we hypothesize that maintenance MK -[ADDRESS_585706] likely to be 
beneficial  in SCLC patients following ‘debulking’ of the tumor with chemotherapy and 
improvement of patient’s performance status with disease shrinkage and control. 
Patients who have complete or partial response or stable disease will be eligible for the 
trial and w ill receive MK -3475 . We believe that in this setting a single arm phase II 
study is appropriate since the duration of progression free survival following initial 
chemoth erapy is very well established in this clinical setting  over a long period of time 
and over several trials .  
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
An open -label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial 
evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 
weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well 
tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of 
MK-3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size 
reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  Recent data from 
other clinical studies within the MK -3475 program has shown that a lower dose of MK -
3475 and  a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical 
activity.  
 
PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  
Pharmacodyna mic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target

Confidential  Limited Access   
engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides 
scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has b een performed using serum concentration 
time data from [ADDRESS_585707] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma ind ication.  The differences in 
exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight 
based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins 
of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK -3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposu re margins are based 
on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the 
proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5 -fold higher dose and exposure). The 
population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of  tumor burden 
on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma 
indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure betwee n different 
indication settings. Based on all these data MK -[ADDRESS_585708] 4 weeks apart  for 
definition of progression. The patients will cont inue on study therapy until these criteria 
are met, unless there is a decline in patient’s performance status or symptoms that is 
considered not acceptable by [CONTACT_324896], or the patient wants 
to discontinue therapy for any reason .      
In this trial we will not only assess PFS by [CONTACT_458528]. In addition we will assess response to MK -[ADDRESS_585709]:   MK-3475   13

[IP_ADDRESS]  Biomarker Research  
Emerging data suggests that expression of PD -L1 on the tumor may predict for benefit 
from the MK -3475 and other anti -PD-1. Benefit has also been observed in patients 
whose tumors don’t express PD -L1 but the percentage of such patients who benefit is 
far less. This difference in effic acy with anti - PD-1 drugs has been observed across 
tumor types. The rate of PD -L1 expression in SCLC is not well defined. We therefore 
plan to assess the expression of PD -L1 in tumors of patients enrolled on the trial and 
correlate the presence of PD -L1 wi th efficacy end points.    
Tumor content in diagnostic biopsies is likely to be limited in SCLC patients. In 
addition, biopsy of residual tumor following initial chemotherapy may be challenging. 
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) hold great promise as a readily  available source 
material that can offer real -time insight into a tumor’s genomic architecture. CTCs can 
be detected in small cell lung cancer patients and appear to have prognostic importance 
(20, 21). We propose to collect CTCs and assess PD -L1 expressi on in CTCs an attempt 
to correlate PD -L1 expression in CTCs with patient’s primary tumor and with efficacy 
parameters.

6.3 Rescue Medications & AE Mangement  
6.3.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_458530]:  
 Diarrhea: Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of 
enter ocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with 
or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
In symptomatic subjects, infectious etiologies should be ruled out, and if 
symptoms are persistent a nd/or severe, endoscopic evaluation should be 
considered.  
o In subjects with severe enterocolitis  (Grade 3  or greater ), MK -3475 will be 
permanently discontinued and treatment with systemic corticosteroids 
should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent.  When symptoms improve to Grade [ADDRESS_585735] 1 month.  If the treating 
physician believes that the patient is deriving clinical benefit from the 
study drug, then the treating physician after consultation with the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_458501] -3475  
o In subjects with moderate enterocolitis  (Grade 2) , MK -3475 should be 
withheld and anti -diarrheal treatment should be started.  If symptoms are 
persistent for more than one week, systemic corticosteroids should be 
initiated (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent).  When 
symptoms improve to Grade [ADDRESS_585736] 1 month.  Regarding guidelines for 
continuing treatment with MK -3475, see Section 5.2.  
o All subjects who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid  
and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  
 Nausea/vomiting: Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and 
consideration should be given in subsequent cycles to the administration of 
prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to stand ard institutional practice.  
Subjects should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake.  
 Anti-infectives: Subjects with a documented infectious complication should 
receive oral or IV antibiotics or other anti -infective agents as considere d 
appropriate by [CONTACT_199948] a given infectious condition, 
according to standard institutional practice.

 Immune -related adverse events: Please see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  below regarding 
diagnosis and management of adverse experiences of a potent ial immunologic 
etiology.   
 Management of Infusion Reactions:  Acute infusion reactions (which can 
include cytokine release syndrome, angioedema, or anaphylaxis) are different 
from allergic/hypersensitive reactions, although some of the manifestations 
are common to both AEs.  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or 
shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours 
of completion of infusion. Signs/symptoms may include: Allergic 
reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever);  Arthralgia (joint pain); 
Bronchospasm; Cough; Dizziness; Dyspnea (shortness of breath); Fatigue 
(asthenia, lethargy, malaise); Headache; Hypertension; Hypotension; Myalgia 
(muscle pain); Nausea; Pruritis/itching; Rash/desquamation; Rigors/chills; 
Sweating  (diaphoresis); Tachycardia; Tumor pain (onset or exacerbation of 
tumor pain due to treatment); Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals); Vomiting.

metastatic disease, bacterial or parasitic infection, viral gastroenteritis, or the first 
manifestation of an inflammatory bowel disease by [CONTACT_323843], 
stool cultures, and a  Clostridium difficile titer.  
Course of Action  
Grade 1 diarrhea :  
– Treat symptomatically (loperamide, oral hydration, electrolyte substitution and 
ADA colitis diet).  
– Endoscopy is recommended if symptoms persist.  
Grade 2 diarrhea (or persistent Grade 1) :   
– Hold MK -3475.  
– GI consultation and endoscopy is recommended to confirm or rule out colitis for 
Grade 2 diarrhea that persists >1 week or Grade 1 -2 diarrhea with rectal bleeding 
(additional guidelines for the treatment of persistent colitis are provi ded below).

– Grade [ADDRESS_585740] for >1 week or Grade 2 events should be treated with 
the addition of oral diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_458504] 9 mg daily.  
– Grade 2 diarrhea with diffuse ulceration a nd bleeding seen on endoscopy may 
require oral steroids with prolonged taper and represent an increased risk for the 
development of bowel perforation.  
– When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less th an 4 weeks.  
 
Grade 3 -4 diarrhea (or Grade [ADDRESS_585741] after initial steroid treatment) : 
– Hold/Discontinue MK -3475.  
– Rule out bowel perforation.  Imaging with plain films or CT can be useful.  
– Consider consultation with Gastroenterologist and confirmation biopsy with 
endoscopy  
– Treat with intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 125 mg) followed by [CONTACT_458531] (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg once per day or dexamethasone 4 mg 
every 4 hours)  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, s teroid taper should 
be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Taper over 6 to 8 weeks in 
patients with diffuse and severe ulceration and/or bleeding.  
– If IV steroids followed by [CONTACT_458532] 48  to 72 hours, consider treatment with infliximab at 5 mg/kg 
once every 2 weeks. Discontinue infliximab upon symptom relief and initiate a 
prolonged steroid taper over 45 to 60 days. If symptoms worsening during steroid 
reduction, initiate a retapering of s teroids starting at a higher dose of 80 or 100 
mg followed by a more prolonged taper and administer infliximab.  CAUTION: 
infliximab is contraindicated in patients with bowel perforation or sepsis [12].  
– If symptoms persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_447246] a s urgical consult should be

Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed  
contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including 
oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents).  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown 
risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order 
to participate in the study they must adhere  to the contraception requirement 
(described above) for the duration of  the study and during the  follow -up period

is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life -threatening complication  to the mother or newborn).  The study 
investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male

Tumor content in diagnostic biopsies is likely to be limited in SCLC patients. In addition, 
serial biopsi es are challenging in patients with SCLC. Also after completion of 
chemotherapy, biopsy of residual tumor may be challenging. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) 
hold great promise as a readily available source material that can offer real -time insight into a 
tumor’s genomic architecture  as well as tumor burden . CTCs can be detected in small cell 
lung cancer patients and appear to have prognostic importance (20, 21). [CONTACT_428974], 
Director of the Biobanking and Correlative Sciences Core  will supervise quant itation of 
CTCs in patients enrolled on this study. Peripheral blood (8 mL) will be  collected into a  Cell 
Search CTC collection tube . Tumor  cells are then subject to negative immunomagnetic 
selection with anti -CD45 antibodies and positive immunomagnetic se lection with EpCAM 
antibodies  and fluorescently labeled for quantitation . These fluorescently labeled cells can be 
stained for PD -L1 for correlation with tumor progression assessment.  Alternatively, t he 
immunomagnetic platform allows isolation of EpCAM se lected cells from the peripheral 
blood from which mRNA can be reverse -transcribe d for RT -PCR. Using beta -actin as an 
internal control, mRNA expression levels of target gene s can be ascertained . As a correlate to

11.2 Sample Size and Accrual Rate:  
 
The median PFS in SCLC patients who have stable or responding disease following 
initial chemotherapy is approximately [ADDRESS_585790] that the experimental 
treatment will improve the median PFS 50% to 3 months. Assume an exponential and 
one-sided alpha  0.05,  40 patients accrued in 18 months with minimum follow -up time 
6 months will achieve 80% power to test the null hypothesis that median PFS is 2 
months versus the alternative of 3 months. [PASS14.0.7]  (29).  In this protocol, we 
assume  about  10% of pati ents will be ineligible.  Thus, a total of [ADDRESS_585791]:   MK-3475 45

It is estimated that approximately 28 patients per year should be accrued once the study 
is open at all sites (4 -5 sites). Thus, the accrual duration will be about [ADDRESS_585792] (median, 1 -year rate, etc.) will be derived. 
Both point and 95% confidence interval est imates of PFS will be calculated. In this trial 
we will also assess PFS using modified criteria as well. It is well recognized that 
patients treated with immune therapy may have pseudo progression or can have delayed 
response.  The modified PFS requires RECIST defined progression on [ADDRESS_585793] confidence 
interval estimates will be calculate d for the toxicities and response rates.  Cox model 
will be used to evaluate the association between time to event outcomes and covariates 
such as PD -L1 status and CTCs.  
PD-L1 (yes/no) in tumor tissue and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) will be measured 
and their association will be studied with logistic regression. We will explore 
associations between PD -L1 and PFS, modified PFS, and OS using the Cox model. If

these events. ECIs are selected adverse experiences that must be reported to the 
Princi pal Investigator and [COMPANY_006] within 72 hours from the time the  Investigator is 
aware of such an occurrence and require additional detailed information to be  collected 
and entered in the study database.  
 
Based on the available data , and consideration of mechanism of action of MK -3475,  
potential immune -related adverse events (irAEs) are the primary ECI. Given that 
immune -related  events can involve different organ systems, following section provides 
information  on the major  potential target organs that could be affected by [CONTACT_90338] -3475 and 
other molecules that function via an  immune mechanism. It is possible that irAEs other 
than those listed in this document may be  observed in patients receiving MK -3475; 
therefore, all adverse events (AEs) of unknown etiology  associated with drug exposure 
should be evaluated to determine if it is possibly immune -related .

parasitic infection, viral gastroenteritis, or the first manifestation of an inflammatory bowel 
disease by [CONTACT_323843], stool cultures, and a Clostridium difficile titer.  
Course of Action  
Grade 1 diar rhea:  
– Treat symptomatically (loperamide, oral hydration, electrolyte substitution and 
ADA colitis diet).  
– Endoscopy is recommended if symptoms persist.  
Grade 2 diarrhea (or persistent Grade 1):   
– Hold MK -3475.  
– GI consultation and endoscopy is recommended to confirm or rule out colitis for 
Grade 2 diarrhea that persists >1 week or Grade 1 -2 diarrhea with rectal bleeding 
(additional guidelines for the treatment of persistent colitis are provided below).   
– Grade [ADDRESS_585812] for >1 week or Grade 2 events should be treated with 
the addition of oral diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_458504] 9 mg daily.  
– Grade 2 diarrhea with diffuse ulceration and bleeding seen on en doscopy may 
require oral steroids with prolonged taper and represent an increased risk for the 
development of bowel perforation.

– Hold/Discontinue MK -3475.  
– Rule out bowel perforation.  Imaging with plain films or CT can be useful.  
– Consider consultation with Gastroenterologist and confirmation biopsy with 
endoscopy  
– Treat with intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 125 mg) followed by [CONTACT_458531] (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg once per day or dexamethasone 4 mg 
every 4 hours)  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should 
be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Taper over 6 to 8 weeks in 
patients with diffuse and severe ulceration and/or bleeding.  
– If IV steroids followed by [CONTACT_458532] 48 to 72 hours, consider t reatment with infliximab at 5 mg/kg 
once every 2 weeks. Discontinue infliximab upon symptom relief and initiate a 
prolonged steroid taper over 45 to 60 days. If symptoms worsening during steroid 
reduction, initiate a retapering of steroids starting at a hi gher dose of 80 or 100 mg 
followed by a more prolonged taper and administer infliximab.  CAUTION: 
infliximab is contraindicated in patients with bowel perforation or sepsis [12].

reported to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 72 hours of the event:   
– Hepatitis  
– Hepatitis, A utoimmune  
 
The following signs and symptoms may be associated with any of the above diagnoses.  The 
signs and symptoms below may represent one of the included adverse events, but do not need 
to be reported as an ECI unless the investigator suspects one of the ECI events listed above.  
 
Symptoms  
Symptoms may include (but not limited to):  
– Elevations in:  
o AST >2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  
o ALT >2.[ADDRESS_585817]

Differential Diagnosis  
All attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease, progressive 
liver disease, viral hepatitis, alternative drug toxicity, infectious causes and/or myositis.  
 
Course of Action  
Grade 1 events:  
– Monitor li ver function tests more frequently until returned to baseline values.  
 
Grade 2 events:  
– Monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to baseline values.  
 
Grade 3 -4 events:  
– Discontinue MK -[ADDRESS_585819] or ALT >5.[ADDRESS_585820] and/or total bilirubin 
>3.[ADDRESS_585821]  
– Consider appropriate consultation and liver biopsy to establish etiology of hepatic 
injury, if necessary  
– Treat with high -dose intravenous glucocorticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  When 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a ste roid taper with dexamethasone 4 mg 
every 4 hours or prednisone at 1 to 2 mg/kg should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks.  
– If serum transaminase levels do not decrease 48 hours after initiation of systemic 
steroids, oral mycophenolate mof etil 500 mg every 12 hours may be given. 
Infliximab is not recommended due to its potential for hepatotoxicity [12].  
– Several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen 
when the steroid dose is decreased.  
 
Note: in the event of a drug-induced liver injury (DILI) adverse event (as outlined in the 
study protocol), please follow the DILI guidance outlined in the site Administrative Binder.

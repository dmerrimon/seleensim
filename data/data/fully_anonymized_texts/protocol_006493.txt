1.   Introduction 
This document details our analysis plan for:  Health Care Hotspotting: A Randomized Controlled 
Trial.  This will serve as a record of the planned analyses to avoid concerns over searching for 
results ex post .  We anticipate that further analyses will be conducted as more outcome data 
become available, which we describe below, as well as research that is inspi[INVESTIGATOR_369642].  In addition, as the plan has been prepared in advance of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], it is possible that our 
planned analyses may be modified base d on what we learn during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. 
The structure of the plan is as follows:  Section 2 briefly describes the intervention; Section 3 
reviews the related literature and highlights the innovations of this intervention; Section 4 
provides details on the trial itsel f; Section [ADDRESS_462626]; Section 6 presents the main empi[INVESTIGATOR_369643], including Tables and Figures that we will 
complete as part of the study; Section 7 reports  preliminary analyses in  support of the plan; 
Section 8 briefly outlines our planned next step s in terms of additional data gathering and 
analyses; and   Section 9 concludes w ith caveats and interpretation issues. 
 
2.  The intervention 
The Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers’ Care Management Program, Link2Care, targets 
“super-utilizers” of the health car e system.  These are individuals with medically and socially 
complex needs who have frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369644].  Specifically, the Link2Care program 
targets patients in Camden, New Jersey hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369645]. 
Such heavy utilizers of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369646] a disproportionate share of healthcare spending.  
For example, CCHP analyzed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369647] 2002-2007 and found that 20% of patients accounted for 90% of 
the costs (Green et al., 2010).  When we compare patients admitted to Camden hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], in the year prior to an admission a typi[INVESTIGATOR_369648] 2.5 times more 
admissions in the prior six months compared to ot her patients due to the targeting.  Such patients 
are also much more likely to be readmitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369649], accruing $73,000 in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369650] $[ADDRESS_462627], a 
community health worker, and health coaches.  They  then plan a series of home visits, schedule 
and accompany patients to initial primary care a nd specialty care visits, and support individuals 
3 
as they navigate various social service agencies  to enroll in public programs including Medicaid, 
SNAP/TANF, substance abuse and behavioral health programs, and programs that promote 
housing stability. 
More specifically, upon discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the care team works to visit the patient at 
home within 3 days.  At the initial home visit, the care team (1) performs medication 
reconciliation—an inventory of th e medications prescribed to ga uge appropriateness and patient 
understanding, (2) conducts an assessment of the patient’s perception of the discharge experience and care coordination, medical/hea lth needs, activity/mobility, service needs, and stage of 
readiness to change, and (3) collaboratively sets  goals with the individual, such as compliance 
with the discharge plan.   
The care team then works closely with the patient to achieve these goals.  They aid in scheduling 
a primary care visit within [ADDRESS_462628] ructions.  The team also helps the participant 
complete applications for social services and coaches the patient in self-care.  Subsequent home 
visits evaluate the patient’s and the team’s progress.  The end of the intervention is determined 
based on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85284], indi vidual factors (health educa tion/literacy, disease self-
management, skills development, level of engagement, self-efficacy) and some systemic factors (access to, and the quality of, care, social support, etc.).  The person receives a graduation 
certificate and is then expected to meet healthcare needs in th e future through a primary care 
physician.  From October 2012 to January 2014, the median length of the intervention for those who completed it was 85 days. 
The approach aims to improve the self-sufficiency  of patients in navigati ng the healthcare and 
social-service systems.  It has the potential to reduce healthcare costs a nd improve patient health, 
as patients learn to use primary care to prevent an escalation of sy mptoms that leads to 
rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  In an earlie r, non-randomized evaluation, this program has been found to 
improve health outcomes, decrease utilization of  emergency and inpatient services, and decrease 
costs for a cohort of 36 “high utilizers” fr om $1.2 million monthly to $534,000 monthly, a 
savings of 56% over five years (Green et al. , 2010). 
Due to staffing and financial constraints, Link2Care is currently ad ministered for only a subset of 
the patients who meet the eligib ility criteria, and the patients who are currently approached are 
chosen in an ad-hoc manner. This study would establish a formal process for determining – via 
random assignment – which subset of eligible in dividuals are offered the intervention.  This 
random assignment, which will not reduce the nu mber of individuals who benefit from the 
services, will allow us to isolate the causal effects of the CCH P Link2Care Program.   
These findings will not only be of importance to CCHP and the Camden patients they serve, but 
will also inform any expansion of CCHP’s programs. The Link2Care program has received 
4 
national attention (Gawande 2011) . And the CCHP’s [ADDRESS_462629] large effects on s ubsequent utilization.  Naylor et al. (2011) 
reviewed the literature on th ese programs.  They studied [ADDRESS_462630] two home visits by [CONTACT_39137], we also find that some programs are shown to 
significantly reduce read missions but not all.1  [COMPANY_005] et al. (2012) reviewed 25 RCTs of disease 
management interventions for chronic heart failure (CHF) patients.  They conclude that case management interventions led by a heart failure specialist nurse, as well as multidisciplinary 
interventions delivered by a team, are successful in reducing readmissions and mortality at 
twelve months.  
While the evidence is therefore mixed, Naylor et  al. point out that there were some common 
themes among the more-successful interventions.   In particular, they tended to be engaged with 
patients for a longer period of time—typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 2-3 months—and they usually included home 
visits by [CONTACT_39137].  In addition, they often included “comprehensive discharge planning with 
follow-up interventions that incorporate patient and caregiver goal setting, individualized care 
planning, educational and behavioral strategies, and c linical management.”  Link2Care aims to 
implement these best practices.   
One of the more successful interventions is described by [CONTACT_369716] . (2004):  a three-month 
intervention with nurse home visits for a popul ation over the age of 65 with congestive heart 
failure.  The treatment group had a rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_369651] 52 weeks at a rate of 47.5% vs. 
61.2% for the control group, a difference that was st atistically significant w ith a sample size of 
239.   In terms of heterogeneity of effects, prior studies often lack the power to distinguish effects 
across subgroups.  Some studies (e.g. Shumway et al. 2008 and Jack et al. 2009) found a larger 
reduction in subsequent utiliza tion among "high risk" subgroups, identified as either having 
higher utilization prior to the intervention or more co-morbidities.  Studies that focus on mental-health patients tend to find little effect of interventions.  Link2Care targ ets patients who may be 
 
1 Rich et al. (1995), Naylor et al. (1999), Naylor et al. (2004), Daly et al. (2005), and Parry (2009) find significant 
reductions in subsequent utilization;  Siu et al., (1996), Brown et al. (2006), Allen et al. (2009), and Dixon et al. 
(2009) do not find such reductions.  
5 
the most amenable to such an intervention:  high-cost patients who suffer from multiple 
comorbidities, excluding patients who suffer exclusively from mental health conditions. 
3.2.  Distinguishing features of Link2Care 
A few main characteristics disti nguish Link2Care from interventions in the existing literature.  
First, the Link2Care model specifica lly targets “super-utilizers” of hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_10422].  Patients have to 
have had [ADDRESS_462631] 6 months to qualify for the program.  A few studies 
targeted high-utilizers of emergency depart ments (Shumway et al. 2008, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_369652]. 1996), 
but this is a very different (and lower cost) popul ation; we have not s een any other randomized 
evaluation of an intervention that targ ets hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] “high-utilizers” explicitly.2  Given the right-
skewness of health care spending, an intervention that can “bend the cost curve” for the highest 
cost patients would be of great interest.   
Second, it is unique in the sense that it has both an intensive clinical component and an intensive 
social component. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_369653], such as desi gning an individualized care pl an, discussing patients’ needs, 
assisting patients in making follow-up appointments and sometimes accompanying them to these 
appointments.  Link2Care teams seem to make an exceptionally intense and aggressive effort to 
help patients obtain social services. For exampl e, the intervention team not only helps patients 
apply for housing, but accompanies them to the Social Security Administration and the Motor 
Vehicle Commission offices to obtain necessary identification.   
One intervention that appears to have similarly intensive social interventions as Link2Care was 
conducted by [CONTACT_369717]. (2008).  This intervention did not include a clinical component, 
however.  It did target patients who freque nted the emergency department and found a 
significant reduction in emergency department visits between [ADDRESS_462632] some sort of insurance in order to be eligible. As a result, Link2Care is offered to a wide range of patients:  patients with different 
diagnoses; adults of all ages, and Spanish-speaking individuals (who are typi[INVESTIGATOR_369654]).

6 
4.1. Enrollment 
Enrollment in the trial will be conducted by [CONTACT_369718] a process similar to the one currently used 
to enroll patients into Link2Care.  Patients will be enrolled  at the two major Camden hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]:  
Cooper University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a nd Our Lady of Lourdes.   
Identification of eligible patients will rely on a Health Information Exchange (HIE) that CCHP 
helped to develop.  The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369656], Lourdes, and 
Virtua (a local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369657]).  CCHP is currently 
exploring adding two more nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_600], Kennedy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369658], to the HIE.   
CCHP receives a daily data feed of individuals currently admitted to Cooper or Lourdes hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369659] e prior six months to any of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369660].  A staff member reviews the HIE along with electronic medical record data for pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria.   
Patients must satisfy the following criteria based on the records at the time of the index event: 
• Is currently admitted to Cooper or Lourdes hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (still in hosp ital for recruitment) 
• Is 19-80 years old 
• Resides in the following ZIP codes: [ZIP_CODE] (PO ZIP code), [ZIP_CODE]-[ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE] 
• Has >=[ADDRESS_462634] 6 months (to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369661]
3) 
• Has >=[ADDRESS_462635]: 
• Has >=5 outpatient medications 
• Has difficulty accessing services 
• Lacks social support 
• Has a mental health co-morbidity 
• Is actively using drugs  
• Is homeless  
Patients will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: 
• Already a subject in the RCT (treatment or control) 
• Deceased or discharged prior to triage or recruitment 
• Uninsured 
• Cognitively impaired 
• Oncology patient 
• Index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:

– Complications of a progressive chronic disease with limited treatments 
– A mental health issue only with no co-morbid conditions  
 
A CCHP recruiter will approach individuals deemed eligible before the candidate is discharged 
from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The recruiter will explain the purpose, process,  risks and benefits of the study, 
including the randomization process and interv ention.  An informed consent form will be 
provided and explained. Candidate s can choose to enroll in the trial by [CONTACT_17317]. 
If the candidate enrolls, the recruiter will conduc t a short survey for which the subjects will be 
compensated $[ADDRESS_462636] 800 subjects 
(400 treatment, 400 controls), as described in the next section. 
 
5.  Data sources and outcomes  
5.1.  Data sources 
This plan details the initial analyses using admi nistrative claims data recorded from emergency 
department and inpatient stays in Camden-ar ea hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369663] (HIE) described above.  Th ese data can be matched to study participants 
using identifiers including the s ubject’s name, SSN, date of birth, gender and address.  The data 
include typi[INVESTIGATOR_369664]-data elements includ ing detailed information about admission and 
discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure code s, insurance status a nd hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369665].   
The flow of how the HIE is used  to identify subjects, monitor their enrollment, and study their 
outcomes is described by [CONTACT_369719]:

Data Flow 
 
Below we describe analyses of the comprehensive nature of these data sources and our pursuit of 
complementary data sources. 
5.2.  Primary outcome 
The primary outcome we will analyze is whethe r Link2Care reduces hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394], as 
patients become more self-sufficient in securi ng medical care outside of  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  In 
particular, our primary outcome is any readmission within [ADDRESS_462637] include measures of healthcare utiliza tion, including emergency 
department (ED) visits, and trea tment intensity associated with readmissions (number of days, 
number of procedures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7960], and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369666]).  We are interested in measuring 
effects in the short-term while the program is actively providing services (30-days, 90-days), and 
longer-term outcomes (180-days, 365 days).   Eligible Patients

5.4.  Power calculations and expected sample size 
We employed historical discha rge data from the two enrolling hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5425] 2003-[ADDRESS_462638], we limited the sample to patients who are similar to those 
targeted by [INVESTIGATOR_359340]2Care:  two or more admissions in  the prior six months, between the ages of 19 
and 80, two chronic conditions recorded in the di agnosis codes in the prior year, the chronic 
conditions could not all be mental-health conditions, and the pa tient was not diagnosed with 
cancer in the prior year.  Note th at this approximates the inclusi on/exclusion criteria used when 
determining eligibility through th e HIE described above, but it doe s not include the criteria found 
in the electronic medical record. 
 
We determined that with 80% power and a test size of 0.05, a sample size of [ADDRESS_462639] a 30% reduction in our primary outcome: 180-day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369670].  Compared to the mean 180-day readmission rate of 0.30, this means that we would 
have the power to detect a drop to 0.21.  Although this is a large effect, it is within the set of 
estimates found in the literature for intensive cas e management featuring home visits described 
in the literature review. 
 
Another 180-day outcome where we would have the power to detect a 30% decline is the 
likelihood of 2 or more “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]”, defined as outpatient ED visits plus inpatient 
readmissions, which averages 0.32.  Other 180-day outcomes where we have the power to detect 
a 20% change include any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l visit (an outcome that aver ages 0.54) and the likelihood of 
any outpatient ED visit (an average of 0.42).[ADDRESS_462640] at twelve months as well (e.g. 365-day readmission).  Other 
outcomes where we have the power to detect a 30% decline over the following 365 days include 
the number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042] (which averages 2.7) and the likelihood of 3 or  more visits (which 
averages 0.33).   
  
As a result of these power calculations, we plan to recruit until we atta in a sample size of [ADDRESS_462641] this will take 1-2 years.  CCHP is considering options that may increase the sample 
size of the study or the speed at which the targ et is reached (such as expanding to nearby [CONTACT_369720]).

6.1.  Empi[INVESTIGATOR_369672]2Care 
compared to those who were randomized to the control group.  
Consider an outcome, ܻ ,such as an indicator that the patient was readmitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79638] 
[ADDRESS_462643] i, the estimating equation is: 
ܻ௜ൌߚ଴൅ߚଵͳሺTreatment ሻ௜൅ߚଶܺ௜൅ߝ௜ 
where ͳሺTreatment ሻ௜ is an indicator variable equal to one  if the subject was randomized to the 
treatment group and zero if the subject was randomized to the control group;  ܺ௜ is a vector of 
control variables.  These control variables shoul d be uncorrelated with the treatment indicator, 
but they can aid in the precision of the estimate.  We propose standard demographic and prior-
utilization controls:  age (5-year age bins), sex (indicator that the patient is male), race/ethnicity 
(indicators for African American and Hispanic), and measures of utilization in the 0-6 months prior to the enrollment admission and 7-12 months prior to the enrollment admission 
corresponding to the outcome in the model.
5  For example, if the outcome is a readmission 
indicator, the prior-utilization controls will include the number of admissions over those time 
periods; if it is a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186] (inpatient readmission or emergency department visit), the prior- utilization controls will describe the number of such visits, and for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369673].

ଵis the parameter of interest and measures the Intent to Treat:  the causal effect of being 
randomized into the treatment group.  This can differ from the effect of the program if there is 
non-compliance:  some subjects in the treatment group may not be treated and/or subjects in the 
control group may be treated.  Fo r example, among those assigned to treatment, a patient who is 
transferred from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114682] a long-term-care facility will no longe r be eligible for home visits 
and Link2Care will never begin, or some subjects could withdraw from the study prior to treatment.
[ADDRESS_462644] take up to be high, however, because it is currently close to 100% for 
those approached to be part of Link2Care, and we are randomizing subject s into treatment after 
they have consented to be part of the study.  We  anticipate that subjects  assigned to the control 
group will not participate in the program by [CONTACT_8345]. 
To the extent that there is non-compliance, we will also estimate the effect of actually 
participating in Link2Care, us ing the random assignment into  the treatment group as an 
instrumental variable for program participation.  That is, we will estimate for subject i:

The resulting estimate of ߨଵ is the local average treatment effect:  the average treatment effect

We will also consider time to readmission in da ys, which can be right-censored if the person has 
not been readmitted by [CONTACT_150128].  First, we will estimate Kaplan-Meier survival 
graphs associated with time to readmission for the treatment vs. the control group.  We will also

6.2.  Planned tables and figures 
The following tables list (1) variables that are ava ilable in the claims data from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369674], (2) data th at we expect to capture in a ba seline survey, and (3) data on the 
treatment intensity of the program that will be collected by [CONTACT_369722].  Some of these variables we 
have not used in our preliminary analysis, and although we expect these standard variables will 
be of high quality, we cannot attest to the qua lity of every variable at this time.

divided the number of observations in the targeted column (2). 
12 
Columns [ADDRESS_462649] set of rows includes de mographic characteristics includi ng age, sex, race and ethnicity.  
We also observe the ZIP code of residence, which will be used to characterize the median 
household income of the area where the patient lives.   
 
We then characterize the index admission—the admission where the subj ects are enrolled—
including the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369675], and whethe r the admission type was categorized as an 
emergency.  Intensity of treatment at th e index admission, such as length of stay, could, in 
principle, be affected by [CONTACT_8235].  This will  be described in Appendix Table [ADDRESS_462650] ace where patients receive medical care, marital 
status and family support (which may be important here as Link2Care enlists the family to help 
the patient gain self-sufficiency), military serv ice history (to aid in understanding what programs 
the patient might be eligible to  receive), living arrangements, lit eracy, educational attainment and 
employment.  Two self-reported heal th questions are asked, as well as questions that verify the 
presence of certain conditions, including mental -health conditions, obesity, and substance abuse. 
To summarize the information collected at the ti me the participants are targeted, and from the 
baseline survey, CCHP calculates illness-sever ity scores, and we can compare these scores 
across the groups as well. 
6.2.3.  Outcomes 
Table 3 presents the results for the primary outco me: an indicator that the patient was readmitted 
to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369676] 180 days from discharge from the enrolling hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
13 
To complement the analysis of the primary outcome, Figure [ADDRESS_462651] to 
characterize the time to a readmission:  the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function.  For 
each day, D, this will plot the fraction of each group that has “survived” at  least D days without a 
readmission.  At zero days both groups will have a probability of one, and the survival functions 
will fall as patients are readmitted over time.     
Of course we are interested in other outcom es as well, and although the power to detect 
differences for some of these outcomes is lower than the primary outcome, we may find effects 
that can yield insights into the sources of the main effects and inspi[INVESTIGATOR_286471]. Table [ADDRESS_462652].  Panel A of 
Table 4 includes estimates of effects on other type s of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369677] 180 days of 
discharge: any use of an emergency department and the combined outcome of any emergency 
department visit or inpatient readmission; as we ll as inpatient readmissions that are from the 
emergency department and those that are not fro m the emergency department, as it is possible 
that the program prevents emergency readmissi ons but may promote scheduled readmissions.  
We will also measure the intensity of hosp ital utilization by [CONTACT_369723], the likelihood of two or more readmissions, the number of days in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7960], and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369666].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369678], 
but also reflect pricing decisions by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_69912] d efforts to receive payment, which will impact 
the interpretation of the findings.  They are typi [INVESTIGATOR_369679], and we will report effects 
of the program on the median of these measur es in robustness checks described below.  
We are interested in whether effects are f ound during the intervention versus longer-term 
outcomes where the power to detect effects is some what higher.  Panel B shows that we plan to 
consider 30-, 90- and 365-day measures of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l use, as well as days to readmission estimated 
with a Cox proportional hazard model.   
Different types of patients may experience different casual effects of the program.  After 
consulting the literature and pr actitioners, Panel C describes subsets that we would like to 
investigate separately.  These include patients with more admissions in the prior year, as the literature suggests that effects ma y be larger for higher-cost patie nts:  we can consider whether 
this relationship continues to be found within this set of high-cost patients.  In our examination of historical claims data, 70.4% of  patients likely targeted by [CONTACT_369724] [ADDRESS_462653] the baseline survey results.  Although we are likely 
14 
underpowered to detect differences in effects across groups, we consider such comparisons 
important precursors for future research. 
6.2.4.  Program participation and treatment intensity 
Tables [ADDRESS_462654], program intensity is explored by [CONTACT_369725]:  whether the subject was assigned to treatment—expected to be [ADDRESS_462655] may begin the program but  only once they return home.  The discharge 
status also records whether the patient expi[INVESTIGATOR_24079]. 
For the treatment group, we will know more about adherence to the goals of Link2Care, which 
we will report in Panel C:  whether a visit to  a PCP was achieved within [ADDRESS_462656], Appendix Table 2 provides robustness checks for the primary-out come result shown in 
Table 3, including estimates with and without cont rols, and estimates from a logit model.  In 
addition, estimates will be presented from instrume ntal variable (2SLS) estimation, which allows 
us to estimate the effect of Link2Care for those induced into the program  due to the assignment 
to the treatment group: a local average treatment effect (LATE).  This will take into account the 
fact that some of those in th e treatment group never enroll in Link2Care and cases where patients 
in the control group were somehow treated.   
15 
Appendix Tables 3A and 3B repeat the comparisons  made in Table 4, but check for robustness to 
the estimator used (e.g. the logit model), the ex clusion of controls, a nd the LATE estimates.  
Days to readmission is not considered in th ese tables, as this measure is censored. 
Appendix Table 4 reports intent-to-treat and LATE estimates for three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369680]:  inpatient readmission, any emergenc y department visit, and any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29399] 
(readmission or ED visit).  The estimates will be shown across four time horizons:  30, 90, 180, 
and 365 days.  
 
7.  Preliminary analyses 
7.1.  Who are super-utilizers? Historical data comparisons 
We analyzed a limited dataset of claims da ta from 2002-2011 available to CCHP for the two 
main Camden hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]: Cooper and Lourdes.  Thes e data contain a subset  of the variables we 
will access in the future.  Consis tent with the inclusion criteria,  we limited the data to patients 
who are between ages [ADDRESS_462657] not been diagnosed with 
cancer.   
We then identified “super ut ilizers”—our proxy for patients lik ely targeted by [INVESTIGATOR_359340]2Care—as  
individuals who at any point had two admissions within a 6 month period (the second of these 
was designated as the index admission), and had at  least [ADDRESS_462658]-admission data.   As can be seen from Appendix Table 5, the targeted patients tend to be older, less likely to be 
female, tend to come from ZIP codes with lowe r household incomes.  By [CONTACT_8345], they also had 
higher hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369681]:  2.8 inpatient admissions accruing 
close to $200,000 in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369682] $25,000 in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369666].  These levels are 2.5 to 4 
times higher than other patients admitted to these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], with 1.1 admissions, $50,000 in 
charges and $6,[ADDRESS_462659] only 0.09 
readmissions on average, and 1 visit to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  In terms of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369683], those targeted by [CONTACT_369726] $73,000 in charges ($8500 in receipts) 
compared to $6600 in charges ($773 in receipts) for other patients. 
7.2.  Camden-area hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369684]  
16 
The longitudinal discharge data that we will access includes information for the three main 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369685]: Cooper, Lourdes, and Virtua.  It is of course possible for 
subjects to be admitted to other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. To the extent that the intervention impacts hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369686], this could lead to different rates of Camden-area hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369687].  
To investigate this issue, we studied discharg e data from New Jersey in 2011.  Although these 
data are not longitudinal in nature, they do allo w us to identify the ZIP code of residence of 
patients admitted to each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. When we consider admissions of patients who reside in the 
ZIP codes where CCHP recruits patients, we fi nd that 87.2% are admitted to Cooper, Lourdes, 
and Virtua hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  Outside of these three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102476], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369688], with 10.6%, and Underwood 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], with 0.43%.  As noted above, we are ho peful that the longitudina l discharge data will 
include these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369689], wh ich would bring the cove rage rate up to 98.2%.
[ADDRESS_462660] share is attributed to Capi[INVESTIGATOR_369690], at 0.41%, which is located in Trenton, NJ:  
[ADDRESS_462661]. 
8.1. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data 
To complement the claims data from the three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102476], other m easures of utilization 
may become available from the Centers for Me dicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  In 
particular, we are interested in  enrollment into Medicaid, as this is often facilitated by 
[INVESTIGATOR_359340]2Care.  While Link2Care ta rgets individuals who are insu red, some are eligible for 
Medicaid but have not yet enrolled.

[ZIP_CODE]), Cooper, Lourdes and Virtua hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369691] 92.6% of patients, and adding Kennedy and Underwood 
increases the coverage to 98.3%. 
17 
For subjects who are covered by [CONTACT_369727]/or Medicaid at th e start of the study, we hope to 
study healthcare utilizati on.  First, we can revisit the read mission variable using all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369692].  Second, we can analyze outpatient utilization, which 
provides a broader pi[INVESTIGATOR_369693]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
In particular, a goal of the program is to ensu re that each patient sees a primary care physician 
with seven days after discharge and specialists soon after discharge if that is part of the discharge 
plan.  We hope to measure the rate at which this happens, as well as the number of physician 
visits over time.   
We anticipate that one mechanism for reducing re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369694], and we hope to measure the number of prescriptions filled and changes 
to the prescription regimen over time.  
Admission to a skilled nursing facility is costl y, and we hope to use CMS data to estimate the 
effects of program participati on on this outcome as well.   
In terms of a health outcome, we plan to consider is mortality, which is available from CMS 
data.  We believe mortality rates are not as high among this population that spans the entire adult 
age range compared to prior work th at focused on the elderly, however.

18 
One caveat is that the program may have other benefits and costs that we are not currently 
measuring.  For example, Link2Care aims to improve  health and quality of life.  We will attempt 
to measure these with mortality, healthcare utilization associated with greater limitations using the CMS data, and social-services data such as employment measures. 
Link2Care may also have costs beyond operational costs, including the grea ter use of outpatient 
care and prescription drugs.  Again, we aim to expand the data sources to include longitudinal 
data on all healthcare use. 
Second, the study will consider a program that is well established.  If we find large effects, it will 
be useful to investigate how the lessons learned by [CONTACT_369728].   
Third, the study considers the enti re package of services provid ed by [CONTACT_369729]2Care program.  It 
will not be possible to ascertain which components of the program are most effective or whether the impact is greater because they are offered t ogether.  Subsequent research could consider the 
components separately. 
Fourth, the study is particularly appropriate to st udy “partial equilibrium” effects of Link2Care.  
If Link2Care were to greatly expand and dramati cally affect hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369695], this could have 
broader effects that this study is not designed to estimate.

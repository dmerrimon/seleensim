     Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by [CONTACT_221543], ovulatory 
dysfunction and polycystic ovaries .  Insulin resistance (IR) is a common feature of PCOS, and 
the resultant hyperinsulinemia has been theorized to promote hyperandrogenism in the disorder. 
However, 30-50% of women with PCOS who are lean do not have insulin resistance. Women 
with PCOS also exhibit chronic low -grade inflammation.  We have shown that in PCOS, glucose 
ingestion activates nuclear factor κB (NFκB), the cardinal signal of inflammation culminating in 
upregulation of the inflammation pathway  within mononuclear cells (MNC) .  This phenomenon is 
independent of excess adiposity  and is highly correlated with circulating androgens.  In addition, 
in vitro exposure to proinflammatory stimuli  is capable of directly stimulating ovarian theca cell 
androgen production.  Salicylate administration has been shown to suppress NFκ B activation, 
and the n onacetylated form of salicylate is well tolerated in humans.  
 
     The proposed research is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of 90 women 
with PCOS.   Forty -five subjects with PCOS (1 5 lean without IR) , 15 lean with IR and 15 obese)  
receiving salsalate, a nonacetylated salicylate, at an oral dose of 3-4 gm daily for 12 weeks  will 
be compared with 45 age- and body -composition-matched control  women with PCOS receiving 
placebo (Fig. 1). The overarching hypothesis  is that inflammation contributes to ovarian 
dysfunction,  independent of excess adiposity or IR.  
 
     The specific aims are, I: To 
examine the effect of salsalate 
administration on the ovari an 
capacity to secrete androgen on  
and insulin sensitivity  in PCOS.   
II: To examine the effect of 
salsalate administration on the inflammatory response of mononuclear cells induced by [CONTACT_221544]. The approach 
involves evaluation of ovarian 
androgen secretion in response to human chorionic gonadotropin administration and insulin sensitivity during the insulin-
modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FS -IVGTT)  along with ovulation 
monitoring before and after salsalate  administration.  The inflammatory response of MNC  to lipid 
ingestion will also be evaluated during treatment by 
[CONTACT_221545], the 
mRNA and protein content of inflammation markers, NFκB activation  and cytokine release in culture.  
 
     It is our expectation that women with PCOS receiving  salsalate will  exhibit decreased ovarian 
androgen secretion and reduced  inflammation regardless of the degree of adiposity or IR status.  
These results will be significant because they will show  a causal contribution of inflammation to 
ovarian dysfunction in PCOS, thereby [CONTACT_221546]; o pen previously unexplored therapeutic avenues that are not necessarily dependent on 
improving IR; and guide the design of future studies aimed at determining what dietary 
modifications, medical regimen or both will optimally attenuate inflammation in PCOS to reduce medical disease and enhance fertility.

hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clamp studies.19,23,26 Performance of a novel minimal model -based 
analysis from an insulin -modified FS-IVGTT is able to address this confounding factor.  With this 
approach, hepatic and extrahepatic insulin clearance can be estimated before and after 
salsalate treatment to obtain measures of insulin sensitivity that take into account the salsalate-induced alteration in insulin clearance.  The FS -IVGTT using the minimal model approach has 
been used for nearly four  decades as a metabolic research tool and has been widely 
published.
27-32  A co-investigator (Quinn)  is experienced in the performance of the minimal 
model FS -IVGTT.33,[ADDRESS_266156] for developi[INVESTIGATOR_221494].  
 
3.0 Objectives / Aims  
     The main objective of this proposal is to evaluate the ability of salsalate to reduce ovarian 
androgen secretion, induce ovulation and decrease lipid- and glucose- stimulated inflammation 
independent of body composition and IR in women with PCOS; and to also improve insulin sensitivity in IR women with PCOS.  Effects of salsalate will be assessed based on the following aims:  
   
Specific Aim 1. To examine the effects of salsalate administration on the ovarian capacity 
to secrete androgens, menstrual function, and insulin sensitivity in PCOS.    
     The hypothesis  for this aim is that salsalate treatment will decrease HCG -stimulated ovarian 
androgen secretion and induce ovulation in women with PCOS regardless of body composition or IR status; and may also improve insulin sensitivity in IR women with PCOS. We will test this 
hypothesis in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. The ovarian androgen response to HCG administration will be evaluated in women with PCOS (15 lean with IR, 15 lean without IR and 15 obese) before and after administration of a therapeutic salsalate dose for ~12 weeks compared with women with PCOS receiving placebo for ~12 weeks (15 lean with IR, 15 lean without IR and 15 obese). Ovulation monitoring will occur in all subjects  using timed 
progesterone measurements and serial follicular ultrasonography as indicated. Fractional 
glucose disappearance per insulin concentration unit adjusted for insulin clearance will be 
determined as a measure of insulin sensitivity (S
I) during a FS-IVGTT before and after salsalate 
or placebo administration. We anticipate that salsalate will reduce the exaggerated ovarian androgen response to HCG administration and lead to hormonal and sonographic evidence of 
ovulation regardless of body composition or IR status when compared with placebo. We also 
anticipate that salsalate will increase S
I in IR women with PCOS compared with placebo.  
 
Specific Aim 2. To examine the effect of salsalate administration on the inflammatory 
response of mononuclear cells induced by [CONTACT_221547]. 
      The hypothesis  for this aim is that salsalate administration will down-regulate inflammatory 
signal transduction and cytokine production within MNC following lipid ingestion and glucose

treatment with the following measurements: a) reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation; b) 
NFκB activation; c) mRNA and protein proinflammatory markers; d) cytokine release from 
cultured MNC culture. It is anticipated that lipid- and glucose -induced inflammation will decrease 
with salsalate use regardless of body composition or IR status when compared with placebo.  
 
4.0 Eligibility   
     The protocol will prospectively study  healthy reproductive-age women with PCOS  recruited 
from clinical practice or various local advertisements (see section 5.0).  Volunteers interested in 
study participation will respond by [CONTACT_221548] e-mail  (see section 5.0).   They will 
subsequently be provided with a detailed study description and undergo an initial pre-screening 
using questions from an eligibility assessment form  (attached). During the prescreening, 
volunteers will be asked to provide their name, contact [CONTACT_3031], age/date of birth, smoking 
status, and information about their  current medical conditions, general and gynecological health 
status and medication use. All  of the answers obtained will be documented in the eligibility 
assessment form  which will be kept in each volunteer’s study booklet.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_221495] / exclusion criteria.  
 
4.1 General I nclusion Criteria:  
• Diagnosis of PCOS based on the presence of hyperandrogenism (skin manifestations of 
androgen excess such as hirsutism, acne or temporal balding ‒ or ‒elevation of at least one serum androgen [i.e. total testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione or DHEA -S] 
using predetermined local laboratory cutoffs), oligo/amenorrhea and evidence of withdrawal 
bleeding after progestin administration.

4.3 Excluded or Vulnerable Populations 
• Although not the primary source  of recrui tment, eligible UIC students and employees  are 
welcomed to participate with every effort taken to avoid any semblance of coercion (see 
section 5.0).   
• Eligible volunteers  from all  racial or ethnic backgrounds are also welcomed to participate.  
• Minors and pregnant women will be excluded by [CONTACT_221550].  Moreover, 
the study question is not  directed to wards  minors or pregnant women.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_266158] Enrollment   
     Volunteers with PCOS will primarily be recruited from the principal investigator’s (PI) 
Reproductive Endocrine referral practice located in the University of Illinois Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221498]  (UI Health) Outpatient Care Center (OCC), Suite 4A . The prevalence of PCOS in the 
general female population is ~15% but is as high as 80% in the referral based patient population 
cared for by [CONTACT_978]. Volunteers with PCOS will also be recruited through physician referral and from advertisements on UIC bulletin boards, electronic bulletin boards , websites such as 
Google.com, local newspapers  and on social media. The advertisements will include a phone 
number and e-mail address  to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_221499]/Gyn Research Nurse Study Coordinator 
who will explain the s tudy and administer a screening questionnaire using an approved eligibility 
checklist  administered either over the phone, or via email correspondence using a secure U IC 
e-mail server contai ning a link to a confidential web-based screening questionnaire  (Screening 
Questionnaire – Treating Inflammation in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome to Ameliorate Ovarian 
Dysfunction) through UIC’s Qualitrics survey tool (http://accc.uic.edu/service/surveys ). 
Advertisements, that correspond with IRB approved flyers or images, may be used on Facebook , Twitter, Instagram  or the study website ( http://www.doyouhavepcos.org
).  
Prospective volunteers  who view the images will be directed to contact [CONTACT_221551].  No direct contact [CONTACT_221552].  No data will be collected from the se platforms.  In addition, other care 
providers who become aware of the study may refer potential subjects for participation.

online platforms that will also be used to assist with study recruitment. Prospective volunteers 
access these platforms to learn about clinical trials with open enrollment from publicly available 
information gathered by [CONTACT_221553] (e.g. study protocols descriptions listed on 
ClinicalTrials.gov).  If a prospective volunteer expresses interest in study participation, the platform sends the investigator an email notification, but only provides the prospective volunteer’s contact [CONTACT_221554]’s request.  The study team can subsequently use an appropriate IRB -approved recruitment tool to confirm interest in study participation and 
study eligibility such as email correspondence containing a link to our confidential web-based 
screening questionnaire as described above.  No direct contact [CONTACT_221555].  No data will be collected from these platforms. 
      A targeted recruitment campaign will also be launched with the assistance of PCOS 
Challenge, the largest nonprofit support organization globally for women with PCOS serving 
over 45,000 members (2,542 in Illinois).  PCOS Chal lenge membership grows at over 20% per 
year, and 92% of PCOS Challenge members have been diagnosed with PCOS. This will be a 
statewide recruitment campaign that includes: 1) One month of bi -weekly emails to members in 
Illinois  sent by [CONTACT_221556]; thus, the 
research team will not have direct access to any email addresses; 2) A study promotional page 
on the PCOS Challenge website (http://www.pcoschallenge.org/) with additional information 
about the study (i.e. title, description, goals, eligibility criteria, exclusions, etc.); 3) A 120mm x 
240mm banner ad promoting the study on every page of PCOSChallenge.com (>40,000 pages).  The email message to members, the promotional page PowerPoint presentation and the 120mm x 240mm banner ad are included for review.  
 
     The CCTS will  further assist in identifying potential study participants using the CRDW– UIC 
CIRCLE as the data source. The data extracted through REDCAP will  include age, height, 
weight, laboratory test results, diagnoses associated with PCOS, and contact [CONTACT_3031] (see 
Data Request Authorization Form). The extracted data will subsequently be transferred to an 
Excel spreadsheet that will be stored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_221500].  A letter of introduction to the study will be sent to potentially eligible reproductive-
age women whose data meet the profile for having PCOS, but only after obtaining permission from the UIC physic ians who care for these women. The letter will indicate that the 
communication was sent with permission from their physician, and will contain study contact [CONTACT_221557].  The data from a given individual will initially be identified by [CONTACT_221558] (MRN), and then coded upon 
study enrollment when these individuals are assigned a study number.  The link between an individual and the coded data will only be known to the PI.  The coded data set without direct identifiers will be stored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_221501].  Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-investigators will have access to the coded data set.  
 
     Each volunteer will meet the PI (or his designee) in the UIC Center for Clinical and 
Translational Science’s (CCTS) Clinical Research Center (CRC) to explain the scientific 
rationale, procedures and potential risks of the study, and the rights of the study participant. 
Informed consent will be obtained from each volunteer prior to participation in the study using a 
consent form approved by [CONTACT_142596].  An electronic note will be written in each participant’s 
medical record regarding the consent, and a copy of the consent form will be given to the participant. The original consent form will be kept with the investigator’s study records. 
 
     Eligible volunteers  will be informed that participation in the study is entirely voluntary, and 
that they may withdraw their consent at any time. They will also be assured that withdrawal from

Furthermore, the information provided during the consent process will be presented in a 
balanced way with equal emphasis on all elements of consent (e.g. there will not be over -
emphasis of benefits and under -emphasis of risks).  
 
6.0 Study Design and Procedures   
     This research will involve the prospective study of 90 reproductive age women (18-40 years) 
with PCOS using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study design. The 
randomization schedule will be stratified by [CONTACT_43658]  (BMI ) (lean: BMI ≥18 but ≤25 
kg/m2; obese: BMI ≥30 but ≤40 kg/m2) and IR status study groups to ensure a balance of 
patients in the two study arms. IR will be defined by [CONTACT_221559] 0-120 
min (insulin AUC 0-120) of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) >7,000 which is highly predictive 
and thus, recommended for population assessment of IR in PCOS.35 Forty five (45) of the 
women with PCOS will receive salsalate of which 30 will be lean (15 without IR; 15 with IR) and 15 will be obese. The other 45 women with PCOS with a similar frequency distribution of BMI and IR status will receive placebo. Thus, the study will be comprised of the following 6 groups:   
1. Salsalate-treated lean PCOS without IR (n=15)  
       – BMI ≤25 kg/m
2 ‒and‒ 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) insulin 
area under  the curve (AUC) ≤7,000  
2. Placebo-treated lean PCOS without IR (n=15)   
            – BMI ≤25 kg/m2 ‒ and‒ 2-hour OGTT insulin AUC ≤7,000 
3. Salsalate-treated lean PCOS with IR (n=15)   
            – BMI ≤25 kg/m2 ‒and‒ 2-hour OGTT insulin AUC > 7,000  
4. Placebo-treated lean PCOS with IR (n=15)   
            – BMI ≤25 kg/m2 ‒and‒ 2-hour OGTT insulin AUC > 7,000                                                                                                               
5. Salsalate-treated Obese PCOS – BMI>30 kg/m2‒≤40 kg/m2 (n=15)  
6. Placebo-treated Obese PCOS – BMI> 30 kg/m2‒≤40 kg/m2 (n=15)  
      After the initial pre-screening, volunteers will be asked to come to the CCTS  CRC  at [ADDRESS_266160] for a screening visit at ~ 8:[ADDRESS_266161] ~4 hours.  At the start of the screening visit, 
volunteers will undergo informed consent followed by  a comp lete history and physical, vaginal 
sonography, and blood draws for a hormonal evaluation if not performed previously, a complete 
blood count  (CBC) , a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and an OGTT.  Based on the 
screening results, volunteers deemed eligible for study participation will subsequently enter the 
study protocol  beginning between days [ADDRESS_266162] to the onset of menses if vaginal

blood draw during all 4 visits  at 0, 24, 48 
and 96 hours  after HCG administration to 
measure serum  androgens and 17-
hydroxyprogesterone.  Visits 1 through 3 will 
be short lasting ~30 minutes.  After one of 
these short visits , subjects will also undergo 
a body composition assessment consisting 
of a whole-body  dual-emission X -ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA) scan  in the 
Integrative Physiology Laboratory (IPL) at  
[ADDRESS_266165] ~[ADDRESS_266166] (CCT)  will also be 
performed in the CRC consisting of dairy cream ingestion and serial blood draws  at 0, 2, [ADDRESS_266167] ~ [ADDRESS_266168]. This schedule will be used 
to assign recruited subjects to receive salsalate (Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) 3 grams/day (lean subjects) or 4 grams/day (obese subjects) in 2 divided doses or identical placebo for ~12 weeks. Study medication will actually be administered over a range of 11 to 13 
weeks to accommodate scheduling glitches without impacting any anticipated treatment effects. 
Subjects and study personnel will be blinded to the treatment assignment. Serum salicylate levels will be measured to assess compliance from a fasting blood sample drawn at baseline 
(Visit 1) and after 4 weeks (Visit 6), 8 weeks (Visit 7) and 12 weeks (Visit 8)  of treatment.   
Compliance will be defined as salicylate levels being in the therapeutic range for rheumatology 
practice (10 -30 mg/dl) during treatment. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will keep 
track of salicylate levels to maintain blinding (see Section 6.0).  A fasting lipid profile will  also be 
drawn at baseline (Visit 1) and after 12 weeks (Visit 8) of treatment. 
 
     During treatment, all subjects will undergo ovulation monitoring consisting of serum 
progesterone measurements timed by [CONTACT_221560].  After the ~[ADDRESS_266169] during Visit 11 and a FS-Table 1.         PRE-STUDY SCREENING

• A complete medical History and Physical Examination will be performed in the in the CCTS  
CRC. A Pap smear will be performed at the same time only if a volunteer is due for one in 
accordance with ACOG guidelines.  Otherwise, a copy of the most recent Pap smear will be requested after obtaining a signed release of medical information from the volunteer.    
 
• Vaginal Sonography  to assess ovarian morphology will be performed during the initial 
screening in the CCTS CRC on the day of the entry history and physical examination. 
Polycystic ovaries will be defined by [CONTACT_221561];36 
namely, the presence of 25 or more subcapsular follicles measuring 2- 9 mm in diameter or 
increased ovarian volume (>10 cm3). 
 
• Body Composition will be assessed at the beginning of the study using 2 modalities: 
 
o Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry  (DEXA, Model LUNAR i DXA, General Electric 
Healthcare, Wood Dale, IL ) will be performed in the IPL at which time anthropometric 
measures of height and weight will be taken using standard techniques. These measures 
are required for the DEXA scan.  All female participants will perform a spot pregnancy 
test prior to DEXA scan. If pregnancy test is positive the participant will be excluded. The 
instrument emits photons at 2 different energy levels as a detection scanner traverses the 
body.  The detected energy passes through the body with differential attenuation that is 
computer analyzed to calculate body fat.  The total fat quantity, and truncal fat quantity 
will be measured, the latter of which is defined as the area between the dome of the diaphragm (cephalad limit) and the top of the greater trochanter (caudal limit).
37  Fat 
quantity will also be measured in the central abdominal area (R1 area) which is an area of [ADDRESS_266173] rib margins at the end of normal expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (the same midline used for waist circumference).
38  Study subjects will wear light clothing and lie on their backs during the 
procedure which takes 10-15 minutes to complete.  Subjects will be e xposed to a 
radiation dose of ≤ 0.3 mrem based upon manufacturer’s specifications and calculations 
from Standford Dosimetry, LLC RADAR Medical Procedure Radiation Dose Calculator.  A 
Radiation Safety Committee review is not required  for this amount of research protocol 
radiation exposure given the estimated effective equivalent dose is below 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year, a limit set by [CONTACT_221562] “general public” 
exposure. 
  
o Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI, Siemens MAGNETOM Trio 3T, Malvern, PA) will be 
performed at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research, [ADDRESS_266174]. The MRI scanner performs an axial scan in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_221502].39 A gradient echo pulse sequence with 
water suppression to obtain a fat-only image is followed by [CONTACT_221563] a water-only  image and no suppression to serve as an anatomic reference.  Five 4 mm 
slices centered at L3 are obtained and the fat signal intensity ratio [If/(If+Iw)] is calculated from the fat-only (If) and water -only (Iw) images on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070] -by-pi[INVESTIGATOR_221503] a 
map.  The calibration curve obtained from a previous phantom study is used to convert 
this ratio to a fat percentage value that is used to determine visceral and subcutaneous fat volumes with AnalyzeDirect, Inc. software (Stilwell, KS).

intramuscular injection of 5, 000 IU HCG (Pregnyl; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ). Fasting 
blood samples (16 ml each) will again be drawn at 24, 48, and 96 hours after HCG 
administration (please refer to the Risks - Venipuncture / Venous Catheter Blood Sampling 
subsection of Section 7.[ADDRESS_266176] ure).  Every attempt 
will be made to obtain blood samples on time.  However, the baseline sample may be 
obtained within a fifteen minute window and the post-HCG samples may be obtained within 
a sixty minute window after the scheduled time due to any unforeseen technical difficulty .  
Gathering of vital signs during the single blood draw visits will be considered if there is any clinical evidence subject instability.  Plasma will be isolated from the blood samples 
collected and stored at – 80o C until assayed for testosterone, androstenedione and 17OHP.  
 
• Cream Challenge Test (CCT):  All subjects will consume a standard weight maintenance  diet 
consisting of 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat and 15%  protein for 3 consecutive days ( days 1 – 
3) before the test through meals prepared by [CONTACT_221564].  The test will be performed 
in the CRC on the day of the [ADDRESS_266177] of ~12 
hours as described by [CONTACT_221565].41 A polyethylene intravenous catheter will be 
inserted in an arm vein for blood sampling at ~8:30 AM.  The size of the catheter (i.e. 18-23-
guage) will be of suitable caliber for the size of the vein used to gain access  (please refer to 
the Risks - Venipuncture / Venous Catheter Blood Sampling subsection of Section 7.0 for 
the approach and alternatives to intravenous catheter placement).  A baseline blood sample 
(90 ml each) will be drawn in the fasting state at ~9:00 AM.  One hundred (100) ml of dairy 
cream (gourmet heavy whippi[INVESTIGATOR_221505]; Land O Lakes Inc, Arden Hills, MN) will then be 
ingested over 10 minutes.  This dairy cream preparation has 33 gm of fat and 1257 kJ (300 
kcal)/100 ml cream.  The saturated fat content of the cream preparation is 70% (28% 
unsaturated fat), the protein content is <2%, and the glucose content is 0%.  Blood samples 
(80 ml each) will again be drawn at 120, [ADDRESS_266178], the catheter will be removed, and subjects will be fed a study meal for lunch as described above.  Subjects will 
also be discharged with 
weight maintenance  study meals to consume that evening and up 
until they begin the FS-IVGTT .  MNC  will be isolated from the blood samples collected and 
used to measure ROS, or placed in culture, or processed for storage at –80oC until used for 
RT-PCR, Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).  Plasma will also 
be isolated from the same blood samples and stored at –80oC until assayed for cytokine 
levels.   
 
• Diet Instruction and Monitoring:  All subjects will receive detailed diet instructions from a UIC 
Department of Medicine registered dietician on the day of the pre-treatment CCT aimed at 
maintaining a similar weight throughout the study. The instructions will focus on having

• Insulin-M odified FS-IVGTT:  The test will be performed in the CRC two (2) days after the 
CCT after an overnight fast of ~12 hours as described by [CONTACT_221567].32  An intravenous 
polyethylene catheter will be inserted in an forearm  vein at ~7:10 AM (-50 minutes) for 
infusing glucose and insulin.  Another intravenous catheter will be inserted in a contralateral 
forearm  vein for blood sampling.  The size of the catheter (i.e. 18-23-guage) will be of 
suitable caliber for the size of the vein used to gain access  (please refer to the Risks - 
Venipuncture / Venous Catheter Blood Sampling subsection of Section 7.0 for the approach 
and alternatives to intravenous catheter placement). B aseline blood samples will be 
obtained at ~7:40 AM ( -20 minutes), ~7:50 AM (−10 minutes), ~7:59 AM (−1 minute) and ~8 
AM (0 minutes).  The average of the four samples is considered the basal level. A glucose 
solution (0.3 gm /kg) will be administered intravenously beginning immediately after the 0 
minute blood draw.  Insulin (20 mU/kg Humulin; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) delivered in 1 
unit/ml infused over 60 seconds starting at ~8:20 AM (20 minutes).  Blood samples will be 
obtained at -20, −10, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30,

insert the intravenous catheters and obtain blood samples on time.  However, all samples with the exception of those used to measure glucose may be obtained within a fifteen minute window after the scheduled time due to any unforeseen technical difficulty.  A total of 
272 ml of blood (8 ml/sample) will be collected during the entire procedure.  All infusions will 
be stopped at [ADDRESS_266180] lunch.  Plasma will be isolated from the blood samples collected and stored at –80
o C until assayed for glucose, insulin, C -peptide and FFA .  
Preparation of glucose and insulin for infusion during the FS -IVGTT procedure will be 
performed by [CONTACT_221568][INVESTIGATOR_221506].  
 
• Mathematical Model to Assess Hepatic and Extrahepatic Insulin Clearance.   Hepatic and 
peripheral insulin clearances were estimated using a model for insulin kinetics during the 
FS-IVGTT as described in Fig. 3.  
  
The model is based on the following main as sumptions:  
1. Endogenously secreted insulin enters the portal circulation where it travels to the liver before 
reaching the systemic circulation.  The insulin secretion rate (ISR) will be calculated by [CONTACT_221569] C -peptide kinetic parameters.
42  The calculated ISR and the known 
insulin infusion rate will be used as inputs to the model.

Page 16 of 37                                                                                                                                                  5/9/2022  2. The rate of delivery of insulin from the systemic circulation to the liver reported in 
pmoles/minute is equal to the plasma insulin concentration reported in pmoles/liter times the assumed hepatic plasma flow (HPF) rate (0.576 L/min/m
2).43 
3. Insulin clearance occurs in both the liver and in extrahepatic (peripheral) tissues, which includes kidney, muscle, and adipose tissue.  Extrahepatic clearance is assumed to be proportional to the plasma concentration. 
4. Hepatic clearance will be modeled using either a linear or a saturable function.  Both functions will be tested in each subject, and the one providing the best fit will be retained.  Both functions will be considered because some previous studies have suggested linear 
clearance, whereas others have suggested nonlinear and/or time-dependent clearance.
30,43 -
45   No time-dependent changes in parameter values will be modeled. 
 
Given these assumptions, the resulting model requires estimating either three (linear model) 
or four (saturable) parameters from the measured plasma insulin profiles and calculated ISR. 
 
The following equations and parameters correspond with these main assumptions.  The 
HPF rate used in the equations is the combined plasma flow to the liver from the portal vein and the hepatic artery.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
P is plasma insulin reported in pmoles/liter, ISR is reported in pmoles/minute, HPF and CLP 
are reported in liters/minute, FEL is hepatic fractional extraction (dimensionless), Vmax is the 
maximal hepatic degradation rate reported in pmoles/minute, and Km is the hepatic insulin 
delivery rate at which 50% of maximal degradation occurs reported in pmoles/minute. 
 
The differential equations for the linear ( Equation 1 ) and saturable ( Equation 2 ) assumptions 
are as follows:  
   
  
VP is the extrahepatic distribution volume for insulin reported in liters.  Model -identified 
parameters will be normalized by [CONTACT_18694] (BW) for comparison across subjects.  For the 
saturable clearance model, fractional hepatic extraction varies w ith changes in ISR and P.  
FEL values will be calculated in the basal state when compi[INVESTIGATOR_221507]. 
 
To provide measures of clearance that are related to analogous measures obtained by [CONTACT_221570], Equations  1 and 2 will be used to calculate measures that would be

hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clamps or in the portal vein as in endogenous secretion. The 
corresponding clearance values from the model for an intravenous infusion ( CLIV) or for a 
portal infusion (CL portal) will be calculated by [CONTACT_221571] -
state plasma insulin concentration.  These linear model calculations are summarized as 
follows:   
  
  
For the saturable clearance model, the effective clearance parameters vary  with the insulin 
infusion rate, and values will be calculated assuming an infusion rate of 240 pmol/min/m2 as 
commonly used in hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clamps.  The proportion of total insulin 
degradation occurring in hepatic versus extrahepatic tissue s will be calculated by [CONTACT_221572] 240 minute interval. The insulin sensitivity index (S I) will be 
determined from the FS-IVGTT using MINMOD Millenium version 6.02.  
 
• Ovulation Monitoring:  All subjects will maintain a basal body temperature (BBT) chart 
throughout the ~12 weeks of treatment after appropriate instructions.  A blood sample (5 ml) 
will be drawn to measure serum progesterone to detect ovulation on the 7th day of 
temperature elevation of at least ¾oF from baseline indicative of a biphasic BBT response.  
Subjects will be instructed to alert the team regarding the potential need to schedule a 
progesterone measurement when 3 consecutive days of temperature elevation is evident.  
The length of the cycle in which a luteal range progesterone (>2 ng/ml) is documented will be used to time initiation of midcycle urine luteinizing hormone (LH ) monitoring with a 
commercially available kit.  Vaginal sonography will be performed in the CRC on the day of 
the color change signifying the LH surge and the following day to document follicular development and collapse, respectively, as the definitive evidence of ovulation.     
 
6.2 Specimen Collection and Storage   
• Blood specimens will be collected by v enipuncture or from a v enous catheter placed by a 
trained medical person who will remain at the bedside to monitor the subject continuously.

6.6 Specimen Analyses – Laboratory Assays   
• ROS Generation Assay:  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_221512] (4 x 105 cells/ml) will be 
measured by [CONTACT_221576]. A 500μl aliquot of 
MNC (400 cells/μl) is added to duplicate cuvettes containing a spin bar.  The cuvettes are 
placed into a two-channel lumi -aggregometer (Chronolog Corporation, Haverton, PA). 15μl 
of 10mM luminol followed by 1μl of 10mM formylmethionyl leucinyl phenylalenine are added 
to each cuvette. Chemilumunescence is recorded in mV by [CONTACT_221577] (Chronolog Aggroli nk). The gain is adjusted to visualize the curves within range of the displayed graph.  
The peak responses of the duplicate samples recorded to calculate the mean peak.  This 
method was developed by [CONTACT_221578],
[ADDRESS_266181] of diphenylene iodonium on NADPH oxidase has

• NADPH Oxidase p47phox Subunit, p65 NFκ B Subunit, Iκ B, TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1 β Real-Time 
PCR (RT -PCR):  MNC are suspended in RNAlater reagent (Quiagen, Germantown, MD) for 
24 hours at 4oC to stabilize RNA, centrifuged at 6,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4oC to yield a 
pellet that is stored at –80o C un til processing for RT-PCR.  Total RNA is isolated from MNC 
(~20 mg) using an RNAeasy kit (Quiagen, Germantown, MD).  The isolated total RNA (1 µg) 
is treated with DNase (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD), and reverse-transcribed using 
TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and oligo(dT) primers according to the manufacturer’s instruction.  Primers and probes for the individual 
inflammation marker genes are selected using PRIMER EXPRESS software (PE Biosystems, Foster City,  CA).  The internal probes and a 28S rRNA probe are constructed 
as previously described.
52 Internal probes are labeled at the 5’ -ends with a reporter dye (6’ -
carboxyfluorescein), and at the 3’ -end with a non-fluorescent quencher; and subsequently 
phosphate-blocked at the 3’ -end to prevent extension.  The 5’ -end of the 28S rRNA probe is 
labeled with VIC, a proprietary fluorescent dye (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA).  Each set of target primers and probe are co-amplified with 28S rRNA primers and probe.  Fluorescence is measured at each amplification cycle in an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence 
Detection System (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).  The signal for the 
28S rRNA is used to normalize against differences in RNA isolation and RNA degradation,  
and in the efficiencies of the reverse transcription and PCRs. All samples are run in triplicate 
and quantified by [CONTACT_221581] 28S signal.  
The final quantification is achieved with a relative standard curve.

histopaque- 1077 for density gradient centrifugation (400g for 45 minutes) as previously 
described.[ADDRESS_266184] wash and resuspended in RPMI 1640 
culture medium (2mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 90 mg/dl 
glucose) at a final concentration of 5X106 cells/ml. MNC isolated from the pre-CCT fasting 
blood sample will be cultured in medium supplemented with palmitate bound to fatty acid-
free bovine albumin (4%) at varying concentrations spanning the physiological postabsorptive to pathophysiological range (0.4, 0.8, 1.2 and 2.0 mM), in the presence and 
absence of 1 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin (Sigma, St Louis, MO). MNC isolated from the [ADDRESS_266185] blood sample will be cultured without FFA supplementation in the presence and absence of 1 ng/ml of LPS.  After a 24 hour incubation 
(5% CO
2 at 37o C), MNC supernatants will be collected and stored at – 80o C until assayed.  
 
• Plasma Measurements:   All assays will be performed in the Reproductive Endocrine and 
Inflammation Laboratory except those for salicylate and progesterone which will be 
measured by [CONTACT_221582][INVESTIGATOR_307].  Glucose concentrations will 
be measured by [CONTACT_221583] (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH) while plasma insulin concentrations will be measured by [CONTACT_221584] (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO).  C-peptide will be measured by a 2-site immunenzymatic sandwich assay

study. 
 
7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits   
Risks  
• Venipuncture / Venous Catheter Blood Sampling – For screening, we will draw a 
maximum of  22 mL (4½ tsp) to measure hormones  if not performed previously, a complete 
blood count  and a chemistry panel , and 24 mL ( 5 tsp) during  the screening OGTT.  During 
the study, we will draw 64 mL (12¾ tsp) during each HCG -ST, 330 mL (66 tsp) during each 
CCT, and 272 mL (54 tsp) during each  FS-IVGTT. We will also draw an additional 20 mL (4 
tsp) to measure salicylate levels  and fasting lipid profiles,  and an additional 5 mL (1 tsp) to 
measure progesterone for ovulation detection only if warranted by [CONTACT_221573]. 
 
     The Study Visit Blood Sampling Plan included as an Appendix  provides a detailed 
accounting of the volume of blood that will be drawn from each subject during the entire 
study.  These flow sheets provide a detailed breakdown of the tubes that will be used, the volumes that will be drawn, and the types of measurements that will be performed.  The 
Laboratory Flow Charts  also included as an A ppendix  illustrates how the collected blood will 
be utilized for molecular work and cell culture in the PI’s laboratory to effectively generate 
key data to address Aims of the study.   
      The total amount of blood that will be drawn on each  subject during screening and the 
HCG- ST, CCT and the FS-IVGTT is expected to be <1,50 0 ml consisting of no more than 
750 ml obtained ~[ADDRESS_266186] for blood donations.  All subjects will be  screened for blood count.  T he 
decision to proceed with study participation will be reviewed on a case-by -case basis after 
taking into consideration the health status of the individual if the pre-study screen reveals a hemoglobin <11.6 grams; or in the case of  a subject who weighs <70.8 kg, if the pre-study 
hemoglobin is <12.6 gra ms.  In the latter case, blood sampling will be limited to 10.5 m l/kg 
within an 8 week period.  If the complete blood count (CBC) performed during initial 
screening reveals evidence that low hemoglobin is due to iron deficiency anemia in an otherwise eligible volunteer, iron supplementation (ferrous sulphate 325 mg twice daily) will be recommended and a CBC will be performed at appropriate intervals until higher 
acceptable hemoglobin meeting the above criteria is documented before the volunteer 
enters the p rotocol.  
 
     The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_221514] i n subjects with a pre-study  hemoglobin at the lower limit of study eligibility (<12.0 
grams, or <13.0 grams for weight <70.8 kg) .  Subjects in this circumstance will be advised to 
take iron during the study (ferrous sulphate 325 mg twice daily) as a precaution  Additional 
iron supplementation may be recommended as appropriate if a complete blood count (CBC) performed at the end of the study reveals a low hemoglobin.        The potential risks to the subjects associated with venipuncture needle sticks or IV 
catheter insertions include discomfort, possible bleeding/hematoma (~1/1000) at the site, 
rarely an infection, and uncommonly feeling faint from the procedure.  These  risks will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_221586].  From

Page 22 of 37                                                                                                                                                  5/9/[ADDRESS_266187] will subsequently be escorted back to the CRC to complete the particular study visit. Use of the IV-PI[INVESTIGATOR_221515] 2 hours.   
 
     The studies will be performed on the CCTS CRC, which provides staff that assists the 
P.I.  Furthermore, the P.I. has staff trained and dedicated to performing these studies.  All 
catheters will be inserted with meticulous use of sterile technique to avoid infection and 
great care will be taken to minimize any discomfort or complications associated with 
insertion.  The catheters will be kept patent with heparinized saline to prevent clotting.  
 
• CCT, OGTT and HCG -ST – The major risk associated with these tests is insertion of an 
intravenous catheter for blood drawing as discussed above.  Glucose ingestion during the 
OGTT may cause abdominal discomfort, nausea, increased blood pressure, flushing or 
sweating.  Dairy cream ingestion may cause urticaria, pruritus and in rare cases anaphylaxis 
in individuals with an unknown dairy allergy; and much less often may cause nausea, 
cramps, flatulence, bloating or diarrhea in individuals with previously unknown lactose 
intolerance. 
 
• FS-IVGTT – The major risk of this test is hypoglycemia associated with the insulin infusion 
along with the risk associated with insertion of intravenous catheter s for the infusions and 
blood drawing as discussed above.   The frequent glucose measurements will allow prompt 
detection of hypoglycemia, in which case the test will be stopped and the intravenous glucose infusion will be increased or glucose will be given orally for resolution.   
 
• DEXA scans involve a very small amount of radiation. One of the risks associated with 
radiation exposure is cancer. The natural incidence of fatal cancer in the U.S. is about 1 chance in 5.  Everyday radiation exposure from natural occurring background radiation (sun, 
radon exposure in the home) is approximately 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year.  Each subject in 
this study will receive a whole body DEXA scan.  The radiation dose of one whole body 
DEXA scan is approximately ≤0.[ADDRESS_266188] be documented 
prior to undergoing the DEXA scan.  
• HCG Administration – HCG use can cause the following adverse effects:  edema, 
depression, fatigue, headache, irritability, restlessness, ovarian cyst rupture, reaction or pain at the injection site, or a local or systemic hypersensitivity reaction.   
 
     The risk of cyst rupture will be minimized by [CONTACT_221587] [ADDRESS_266189].

of salicylates in descending order of frequency:  tinnitus, nausea, hearing impairment, rash 
and vertigo.  These effects are transient, and resolve upon cessation of salsalate.  Although cause and effect has not been established, the following less common adverse effects have also been reported:  abdominal pain, abnormal hepatic function, anaphylactic shock, 
angioedema, bronchospasm, decreased creatinine clearance, diarrhea, gastrointestinal 
irritation, inflammation, bleeding or perforation, hepatitis, hypotension, nephritis, urticaria, myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.        Tinnitus is an expected side effect of salsalate treatment that occurs more frequently at 
doses higher than the one proposed for this study. To minimize this side effect, subjects will 
be advised to begin by [CONTACT_221588] (i.e. 500 mg of salsalate in subjects receiving 
salsalate) the first day and increase the dose in one capsule increments every [ADDRESS_266190] hepatic or renal impairment has occurred.    
• Reproductive Risk  – Pregnancy is an exclusion criterion for this study.  The risks listed 
above would apply equally to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_221516].  Potential risks of specific impact to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_221517] (point 4 above).  A negative urine pregnancy test  must be 
documented prior to undergoing the DEXA scan.   Salsalate is a Category C drug for 
pregnancy and use of double barrier contraception will be required during the study unless either the participant or her partner have already undergone permanent sterilization.  
 
• Loss of confidentiality  is a risk as with all human subject -based medical research  owing to 
disclosure of health information. These disclosures may be mandated by [CONTACT_221589] (i.e. IRB, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ) or may be unintentional.   
Safeguards regarding both physical and electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_221518], as dictated by [CONTACT_221590]. 
 
Except for de-identified research data, all other information relevant to patients collected in the study will be kept confidential, including locked storage of all paperwork, and secure digital storage on a database to which only members of the research group have access.  
The security and integrity of this database are maintained with the direct assistance and oversight of UI Health Information Technology support teams, and the database is served 
centrally from a closely monitored, regularly backed up server. 
 
• Unforeseen Risks – There may be risks or side effects related to the study that are 
unknown at this time.

• Subjects will receive individual body composition results as well as diabetes risk information 
from the OGTT.  Based on the results of  a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_221519], it is possible that subjects receiving salsalate may  experience a reduction in 
circulating androgens and ovulation.  However, b ecause individuals respond differently to 
therapy, it is not know n in advanced if these potential benefits will occur.  There are no 
anticipated benefits to subjects receiving placebo.    
 
The knowledge to be gained from this research may be beneficial to other patients, society 
or science.   The results will guide the design of future studies aimed at determining what 
dietary modifications, medical regimen or both will optimally attenuate inflammation in PCOS with the goal of reducing medical disease and enhancing fertility.  In particular, the findings may help define the therapeutic molecular inflammation target to develop the most ideal 
anti-inflammatory agent. 
 
 8.0  Data Collection and Management Procedures  
 
• Data will be collected by [CONTACT_978], Co-I or an authorized member of the research team  and 
coded to the study number assigned  to each subject.  All electronic data will be secured on 
the PIs encrypted and passwor d protected computer until it can be moved to a secure UIC 
data server for long-term storage. Hard copy data reporting forms will be stored in a locked 
file cabinet until it can be scanned to electronic copy and archived onto the UIC data server.  
Once files are converted the original hard copy will be kept until the study is closed, at which time the documents will be destroyed. In the event that a discrepency or error is found in the 
source data, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_221520]/procedure repeated in a 
subsequent study visit or alternative visit provided this will not disrupt the integrity of the 
data.  Should this occur,  the event will be documented and reported to the IRB.  Access  to 
the data will be limited to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32397]-authorized members of his research team.  The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_221521]. Source data will be collected in 
data reporting forms of both electronic and written form. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_221522].

completion of an approved CITI human subjects training (or institutional equivalent) and 
refresher courses at required intervals.  
• Each year, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_879] a progress report to the UIC IRB, which will review progress 
and re-approve the protocol. As part of these reviews, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_221525], the outcomes to date and if there have or have not been any non-
serious adverse reactions reported by [CONTACT_36801]. 
• Various aspects of the study will be monitored as follows:  data quality, subject recruitment, 
accrual and retention, adverse events, assessment of scientific reports or therapeutic 
development, results of related studies that impact subject safety, and procedures designed 
to protect the privacy of subjects.  
• A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  will monitor human subject safety, protocol 
compliance and data integrity. The DSMB will consist of three experienced physicians / 
nurses who as a group have a good clinical and investigative understanding of the study 
protocol based on their backgrounds ([CONTACT_221610], Assistant Professor of Clinical 
Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism; [CONTACT_221611], Associate Professor of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology; and [CONTACT_221612] G. Collins, Professor of Nursing). The DSMB will be chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Syed who has  an excellent knowledge base of 
endocrine and metabolic  research and DSMB oversight. [CONTACT_221613]  will also be the medical 
safety monitor.  DSMB members will not be directly involved in the study.  
Initial Meeting:  The DSMB will meet prior to initiation of the study to review the protocol, 
resolve queries, and approve the research protocol and informed consent document.  
Interi m Meetings:  In open session, the DSMB will meet at least twice a year to review the 
ongoing recruitment process, participant withdrawal and protocol deviations.  It will review 
any study protocol amendments and follow the continuing review process. It wil l review 
participant safety and discuss any serious adverse events that may occur, including the relationship of adverse events to study intervention.  It will review the study protocol to determine if any protocol revisions are merited as suggested by [CONTACT_221591], adverse 
events, or external events such as new FDA recommendations.  It will review the informed consent document and confirm consistency with risks of participation to determine if any consent document revisions are merited.  It will discuss  any issues raised by [CONTACT_221592]. At the conclusion of each meeting, one of the following dispositions will be recommend: continue the study without changes, continue the study with specified changes, place the study on Clinical Hold pending further discussion or investigation, or terminate the study.  
Key Features to be Assessed:  Monthly salicylate levels measured at Visits 1, 6, [ADDRESS_266191]’s electronic medical record.  Instead, DSMB members under [CONTACT_221613]’s  
direction will prospectively receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_221526].   
Development of tinnitus during salsalate use will be used to assess salicylate toxicity 
clinically as in a previous large multicenter trial.
19  As an additional precaution, salsalate will 
be prepared as 500 mg capsules and identical placebo capsules so the blinding will not be jeopardized when changing the dose in one capsule increments to manage tinnitus.

first); and thereafter at least twice a year.  If there is a concern about serious adverse 
events, more frequent meetings may be called by [CONTACT_221593].  If unexpected and/or serious 
adverse events occur disproportionately to what may be anticipated, the study will be placed on clinical hold and the IRB will be consulted for guidance.  
Minutes will be taken by [CONTACT_221594].  The final version of the minutes will be sent to all DSMB members for 
approval.  A formal report from the chair, following approval by [CONTACT_221595].  Each report will conclude with a 
recommendation selecting one of the following dispositions:  continue the study without changes, continue the study with specified changes, place the study on clinical hold pending further discussion or investigation, or terminate the study. In the case of clinical hold or study termination, the report will be disseminated to the research team as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_221527].   
Interim Reporting:  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_221528]. Types of reports for 
each meeting include summaries of the following: baseline clinical and demographic 
characteristics of study participants, the recruitment process, including numbers screened, numbers enrolled, withdrawals, adherence and deviation from the study protocol. Any 
adver se events, including serious, study -related adverse events, will be evaluated by [CONTACT_40746].  In particular, they will be concerned with adverse events that may affect continued 
study participation.  Specific items to be reported will include: tinnitus during study medication treatment, hypoglycemia during an OGTT or FS-IVGTT, allergic reactions to 
study medications or any other serious adverse events.

HCG injection, dairy cream ingestion during the CCT, difficulty obtaining a peripheral intravenous line, administration of salsalate (i.e. allergies, persistent or serious side effects, unusual anxiety).  The participant’s treating physician will  attend to any serious adverse 
events that may occur until they have resolved or refer the participant to the appropriate 
provider as needed.  A participant will also be asked to stop the study if she is not compliant 
with the requirements of the study protocol.  All participants will be assessed for side effects at the end of the study.  Study discussions will be documented within each participant’s study binder.  Follow -up with the IRB or CCTS CRC will also be noted, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_221530].

12.0 Statistical Considerations  
12.1 Data Analysis   
• OGTT Dynamic Responses:  The glucose and insulin responses during the OGTT is defined 
as the area under the curve (AUC) created by [CONTACT_221596].55 
 
• HCG-stimulated Dynamic Responses: The testosterone, androstenedione and 17-
hydroxtprogesterone responses during the HCG -ST is defined as the area under the curve 
(AUC) created by [CONTACT_221597], and calculated using the trapezoidal rule.
56 
 
• Lipid-stimulated Responses:  Responses of the various inflammation markers from MNC or 
plasma will be defined as the difference between the maximum lipid-stimulated value and 
the baseline basal value. If baseline basal values exhibit considerable intersubject

stimulated value – baseline basal value / baseline basal value) x 100. 
 
• Insulin Sensitivity: The calculated fractional glucose disappearance per insulin 
concentration unit adjusted for insulin clearance will be determined during a FS -
IVGTT as a measure of peripheral insulin sensitivity (S I). 
 
12.[ADDRESS_266195] >20% dropout based on previous studies.19,[ADDRESS_266196]-evaluations are completed up to a maximum of 113 patients 
rather than increasing the overall sample size up front.  
 
Aim 1:   The primary outcome for Aim 1 is HCG -stimulated testosterone AUC. Our salsalate 
treatment preliminary data sample size (n=6) is too small to calculate power for the main outcome.  As there are three groups (lean non-IR, lean IR, obese), the three contrasts of 
interest will be comparing the mean difference in HCG -stimulated testosterone AUC between 
the salsalate and placebo arms within each study group (i.e. salsalate -treated lean non-IR vs 
placebo lean non-IR, salsalate-treated lean IR vs placebo lean IR, and salsalate-treated obese vs placebo obese).  To keep the familywise type I error at 0.05, we will use a Sidak adjustment 
and set α =0.[ADDRESS_266197] data 
revealed similar results in women with PCOS or controls regardless of BMI.  The HCG -
stimulated testosterone AUC (ng/dl x 96 hr) in women with PCOS (n=17) compared with ovulatory controls (n=16) revealed a mean (±SD) of 7370±2481 vs. 3659±959 (p<0.0001, effect 
size [ES] =1.8).  Furthermore, previous data gathered in women with PCOS (n=12) evaluating 
HCG-stimulated testosterone AUC in response to treatment with an insulin sensitizer revealed a significant (p<0.04) decrease in the mean (±SD) from 4395±1294 (pre) to 3288±1259 (post).
[ADDRESS_266198]-salsalate treatment HCG -stimulated 
testosterone AUC will be similar to controls.  The proposed sample size of 90 patients (15 
salsalate and 15 placebo for each study group), will provide 90% power to detect an ES ≥1.4 (80% power to detect an ES ≥1.24), based on a two- sided two-sample t-test at 1.7% 
significance to account for multiple comparisons which will yield similar power to our proposed 
GLM model with a Sidak adjustment to control type I error level.  We used the pre- and post-
treatment HCG -stimulated testosterone AUC data above136 to obtain a reasonable estimate for 
common SD of change for each treatment group. A post -treatment decrease of 30% (7672 - 
0.3(7672)) in the salsalate-treated group and a post-placebo decrease of 10% (7672 - 
0.1(7672)) in the placebo group with common standard deviation of 990 (assuming a correlation 
of 0.7 between pre/post measures) will yield an ES of 1.55.  This analysis is indicative of 
adequate power to detect a difference in our primary outcome.        The secondary outcome for Aim 1 is insulin sensitivity (S
I).  Our primary comparison will be 
change in SI between the salsalate and placebo groups in insulin-resistant subjects (lean IR and 
obese) as we do not anticipate a change in lean non-IR subjects.  Previous data gathered in 
another insulin resistant population (n=9) evaluating insulin sensitivity  in response to salicylate

Page 30 of 37                                                                                                                                                  5/9/2022  treatment revealed a significant (p<0.04) increase in the mean (±SD) insulin sensitivity  from 
4.0±2.7 (pre) to 5.9±1.8 (post).23  These data indicate that a sample size of 30 subjects per 
group is sufficient to achieve 80% power to detect an ES ≥1.[ADDRESS_266199] approximately 
10% to ovulate in the placebo arm, we will have over 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference if ovulation increases by 40% in the salsalate-treated group based on Fisher’s exact test with type I error set at 0.05.  
 
Aim 2:   The primary outcome for Aim 2 is lipid-stimulated NFκ B EMSA density (i.e. change from 
baseline). The three contrasts of interest will be comparing the mean difference in lipid-
stimulated NFκ B EMSA density between the salsalate and placebo group within each study 
group (i.e. salsalate-treated lean IR vs placebo lean IR, salsalate-treated lean non IR vs placebo 
lean non IR, and salsalate-treated obese vs placebo obese). Our preliminary baseline CCT data 
revealed similar results in women with PCOS and obese controls.
11 The lipid-stimulated NFκ B 
EMSA density in women with PCOS (n=17) compared with lean controls (n=8) revealed a mean 
(±SD) % change of 20.1±10.4 vs. -3.0±9.1 (p<0.0001, ES=1.9). The secondary outcomes for 
Aim 2 are glucose-stimulated NFκ B EMSA density and lipid-stimulated ROS generation (i.e. 
change from baseline). For women with PCOS compared with lean controls, our previously 
published baseline OGTT data showed a mean (±SD) % change of 34.6±45.7 vs. -21.6±35.6 
(p<0.04, ES=1.4),[ADDRESS_266200] data showed a mean (±SD) % change of 
92±38 vs. -7±22 in ROS generation (p<0.0001, ES=3.8). For each of these outcomes, we will 
use a similar GLM framework as described in Aim [ADDRESS_266201] 80% power to detect an ES ≥ 1.24. Thus, our study is 
sufficiently powered for these outcome measures.  
     Based on baseline PCOS vs. control data and using the approach described to analyze the 
primary and secondary outcomes, there is also 80% power to detect an ES ≥ 1.24 for lipid-
stimulated p47
phox WB density (16.4±10.9 vs. -6.4±6.3 [p<0.0001, ES=2.6]) and lipid -stimulated 
MNC -derived TNFα  release (8.4±11.8 vs. -7.4±9.4 [p<0.008, ES=1.5]). These 2 variables and 
those for which we lack preliminary data to estimate power; (i.e. salsalate-treated vs. placebo 
lipid- and glucose-s timulated p47phox, p65 NF κB and TNF α mRNA content, and plasma CRP 
and TNFα ) are exploratory outcomes key to providing means and SDs to plan larger studies. 
 
12.3 Statistical Analysis    
     Initially, a full descriptive analysis of the data will be performed. Frequency distributions will 
be computed for all raw data and for change from baseline responses to lipid or glucose 
stimulation. Summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_1570] (salsalate, placebo) overall as well as by [CONTACT_221598] (lean non-IR, lean IR, obese).

will be compared between groups (salsalate: lean non-IR, lean IR, obese; placebo: lean non-IR, lean IR, obese) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for normally distributed data or 
Kruskal-Wallis test for non-normal data to validate similarity of characteristics within each 
study group across the [ADDRESS_266202]-treatment HCG -stimulated testosterone AUC including 
covariates for pre-treatment HCG- stimulated testosterone AUC, treatment indicator, study 
group (lean non-IR, lean IR, obese) and the treatment by [CONTACT_221599]. Of primary 
interest will be the three contrasts of difference in mean between salsalate vs. placebo for these study groups. A Sidak adjustment will be used to control the Type I error. Analysis for 
the secondary measure of difference in S
I between salsalate and placebo for the insulin-
resistant subjects only (lean IR, obese) will be compared using the same GLM framework, 
although only the overall contrast of difference in means between salsalate and placebo is of interest. Assumptions and model fit will be checked for all primary and s econdary 
outcome analyses. Data will be transformed if necessary.   
 
     Post-treatment ovulation rates based on ultrasound documentation of follicular collapse 
will be compared between the salsalate-treated group and the placebo group using Fisher’s exac t test with type I error at 0.05.  Also, ovulation rates and 95% exact confidence intervals 
will be estimated by [CONTACT_2060] (lean with IR, lean without IR, and obese) and treatment group.   
 
iii. Aim 2 will evaluate lipid-stimulated NFκ B EMSA density (pri mary outcome), glucose -
stimulated NFκ B EMSA density and lipid-stimulated ROS generation (secondary outcomes) 
along with the exploratory variables described in the power analysis. Primary and secondary 
outcomes will be transformed (e.g. logarithmic transformation) if either measure is not normally distributed and will be analyzed using a GLM framework as described for Aim 1 to compare salsalate vs. placebo for each study group. A Sidak adjustment will be used to control type I error. Descriptive statistics will be provided for exploratory variables.  
  
13.0 Regulatory Requirements 
 
13.1 Informed Consent  
• Written consent will be obtained in the CCTC CRC during the screening visit after the 
volunteer has successfully completed an initial phone screening.  Each member of the 
research team is designated to administer the informed consent.  Each research team 
member has been trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_221533].  
 
• Each volunteer will receive a copy of the signed informed consent document (ICD)  for 
his/her records.  The study copy of the signed ICD will be stored in the subject’s study 
binder in a locked file cabinet in the PIs locked  office .  Each member of the study team has 
access to these study binders. Because they are stored in the PI’s office, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_221534].

• Subject’s confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_221600][INVESTIGATOR_221535].  
Further, all research team members are Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) 
and HIPAA trained. 
 
• All research team members have access to the study data that will be stored digitally on a 
secu re database.  Study data are kept separate from source documents containing sensitive 
subject information.  Source documents such as initial screening forms, informed consent and other data sheets containing dates are kept in subject binders in a locked cabinet in the PI’s office.  Security standards will include 2 locked doors for paper records, and 2 electronic signatures for electronic data (i.e. main computer, then specific access to data files). The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_221536].   
 
• Upon subject enrollment, the subject is assigned a unique identifier.  This unique identifier 
will be used for all data sheets and data spreadsheet entries.  Only the initial screening form, the informed consent and the identifier key will contain direct identifiers.   
 
• The research team will request access to participant’s PHI through a patient authorization document, which if signed by [CONTACT_221601]. 
 
 
• After  study completion, we plan to scan all source documents into electronic format for long 
term storage on an Academic Computing and Communications Center (ACCC) protected 
UIC server that only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_221537].   Upon verification of electronic transfer, original 
source documents will be shredded and disposed of into confidential file disposal bins.  
 
• Sensitive subject information such as personal identifiers are required to determine subject 
eligibility and required to contact [CONTACT_221602].  Once the subject is enrolled, 
the subject is assigned a unique identifier and these initial source documents are no longer 
needed for the successful completion of the study.  The steps above describe the handling of these source documents.  
 
• A Certificate  of Confidentiality is not required, as the information collected  if disclosed would 
not significantly harm or damage the participant.   
 
13.3 Unanticipated Problems  
• Based on the low level of r isk during study participation, serious adverse events are unl ikely 
to occur. Discomfort during the blood draws will be  most likely problem that could occur 
during participation. Every effort will be made to provide comfort to participants  whenever 
possible. Should participants  experience discomfort or emotional upset from any of the  
research procedures , they  will be reminded that they are under no obligation to participate in 
the study, and can withdraw consent and discontinue participation at any time without 
prejudicing their current or future relations with UIC or  UI Health, or its physicians.  Students 
of employees will be reminded that participation or nonparticipation in the study will not 
affect current or future medical care at UIC or the UI Health and/or position of employment 
or course of studies in these institutions.

also occur. Every effort will be made to maintain subject confidentially using the data 
management procedures described above. In the event of breaches or suspected breaches of data security, including sensitive information, an unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB using the Event Requiring Prompt Reporting form within 5 working days of 
becoming aware of the event. Possible data breaches include, but are not limited to, the 
following: lost or misplaced files/folders, improper disposal of paper containing sensitive 
information, loss/violation of the integrity of decryption key or process.     
• A participant’s study will be stopped in the event she requests not to continue, or if she has 
a reaction to any procedure, the ingestion of the glucose beverage during the OGTT, the 
HCG injection, dairy cream ingestion during the CCT, difficulty obtaining a peripheral 
intravenous line, administration of salsalate (i.e. allergies, persistent or serious side effects, 
unusual anxiety).  In the  unlikely  event that a serious side effect occurs , the participant will 
immediately be referred for further evaluation and treatment.  All participants will be assessed for si de effects at the end of the study  and any discussions will be documented 
within each participant’s study binder.  Follow -up with the IRB or CRC will also be noted, 
and copi[INVESTIGATOR_221538].   
• A participant will be withdrawn from the study if she fails to comply with any of the research 
procedure, if the study is stopped for an unforeseen reason, or in the event of physical injury 
or illness resulting from the research procedures.  Failure to take the appropriate dose of 
medication not related to downward dose titration for expected symptom control can result in 
withdrawal of a subject from the study.  The degree of noncompliance with medication use 
that can have a significant adverse impact on the study may vary from subject to subject and the decision to withdraw a subject for medication use noncompliance will be left to the discretion of the investigator.   
• The study will be completely suspended in the extremely unlikely  event of death of a 
subject, or at the moment it becomes apparent that any particular serious side effect is 
occurring at an unanticipated increased frequency.     
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_221532], and results of 
related studies that impact subject safety; and will inform subjects immediately of new information from these reports or studies that change the risk/benefit ratio that might cause 
them to change their mind about continued participation.  This type of information will also 
be reported to the DSMB and to the IRB during an annual continuing review.  Participants 
will be instructed to notify the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_221539]. The circumstances related to the request to withdraw will be reviewed to determine the necessity  of performing a post-study evaluation to insure safety.

Goal: 
Assess the clinical impact of buffered lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_22493] e as compared to the non-
buffered drug combination  used in dental and oral surgical procedures . 
 
Background:  
Based on discovery of the anesthetic effects and the invention of the hypodermic syringe 
at the end of the 19th century, cocaine was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_29780] d as a means of blocking painful 
sensory impulses during surgical procedures.(1) The discovery of procaine early in the 
20th century led to this newer drug replacing cocaine avoiding the potential addictive 
properties of the latter . Lidocaine and its deriv atives, products of the late 20th century, 
mepi[INVESTIGATOR_9360], bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], and articaine,  are widely used today with invasive 
procedures. (2) Recently local anesthetics have been administered in vehicles such as 
liposomes  to produce longer term sensory nerve blo ckade, reducing the need for 
analgesic drugs, chiefly opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], to reduce pain.( 3)  
 
The addition of a vasopressor, usually epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], to lidocaine and other injected local 
anesthetics serves to prolong the anesthetic effect by [CONTACT_29788]. To prolong 
the shelf life of the vasopressor , the drug combination must be formulated with a low pH, 
approximately pH 3.5 for lidocaine with 1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] . When inje cted, the low pH 
causes the “sting” felt by [CONTACT_29789].  
Perhaps more important, the local anesthetic drug is more effective both in onset and potency if the pH is closer to the drugs pKa, over 8.0. The drug injected at a neutral pH 
reduces the need for buffering by [CONTACT_29790].   
Until recently , buffering the drug combination with bicarbonate just prior to injection was 
impractical for the small quantities used in intraoral procedures. Ho wever, today we do 
have a kit capable of efficiently accomplishing this end.(Anutra Medical, NC)  
Mean maximum blood levels of non-buffered local anesthetic drugs occurs 
approximately 30min post oral injection.(4)  No data exist on peak blood levels for 
buffered local anesthetics used in dental and oral surgical procedures  
 Rationale:  
Anecdotal reports suggest buffer ing lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_29781] , results in a  deeper anesthetic effect , without the “sting” 
with injection  from a low pH . Additional data are needed to establish clinical important 
outcomes  such as the peak blood level of lidocaine as compared to the non-buffered drug 
combination.

Specific Aims:  
Compare blood levels at 30min post injection mandibular block with buffered and non -  
      buffered 2% lidocaine with 1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  
Assess outcomes  (pain levels  during and  post-injection, and onset of anesthesia   
         symptoms) after buffered and non -buffered oral administration  
          of 2% lidocaine with 1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  
Assess possible topi[INVESTIGATOR_29783]- buffered oral     
           administration of 2% lidocaine with 1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_29784] : 
No difference in peak blood levels exist between buffered and non -buffered intraoral    
          injection of 2% lidocaine with 1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  
Injection of buffered local anesthetic will produce less discomfort for the subject as  
        compared to the drug with a low pH. 
Buffered local anesthetic will not produce a topi[INVESTIGATOR_29785]:  6 months

Methods:  Blinded, Randomized Clinical Design   
Recruit subject s with IRB approved consent at  UNC  
Target enrollment 24 subjects 
Subjects will serve as their own controls  in a cross -over study design .  
Sample size justification:  Primary interest is estimation of effect size from pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
24 subjects should be sufficient to provide data to as sess whether a larger study is    
               warranted and provide estimates for sample size calculation for larger stud ies.  
Vital signs recorded: [ADDRESS_29047]-anesthetic    
              clinical signs  disappear: targeted lower lip no longer numb.  
Randomize d subjects to be injected alternatively with 4cc of buffered and   
           4cc non-buffered oral administration of 2% lidocaine with 1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] . 
SAS will be used to create randomization schedules :  
     The randomization will be performed first to type of drug given with a balanced        
      randomization ( half subjects  buffered; half  to non-buffered)  
An OMS resident , [CONTACT_29792], will administer the drugs  in the OMS clinic . 
 In week One  each subject would receive anesthetic to block the inferior alv eolar  
          and lingual N ; Halstead or Gow -Gates techniques.  No Buccal N. block.  
At least a week later  injections would involve the alternate local anesthetic combination.  
Venous blood samples wou ld be drawn from the antecubital fossa 30min  
           post oral injection  and assayed for blood lidocaine levels  
Timed Assessment : pre, during injection, and post -anesthetic for Clinical   
     Onset of Anesthesia Signs: subject reported molar area numb ness  
         and numb lower lip  on ipsilateral injected side . 
Assessment for pain level on injection ; modified Likert- type scale  
 
In addition at each clinic session an a ssessment of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_29786] 5 drops of the injected drug placed on the clinically dry

Data Collection/ Analysis:  
Data will be managed by [CONTACT_29791]’s staff. Data collection forms and questionnaires for 
clinical data will be developed to use Teleform for direct scanning input into an ACCESS 
database.  Similar forms have been used in previous studies. All databases are stored on a 
password  protected server with specific group assignment.  SAS will be used for database 
management and statistical analysis.  Descriptive statistics are used to verify correct entry through range and logical checks.  
 Statistical analysis Primary interest is the difference between type of injection – 95% 
confidence intervals for the difference between injection types will be calculated.  For all 
outcome variables, an assessment of treatment difference, calculated as 1% Buffered minus 2% Non- Buffered, will be perfo rmed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests with Proc 
NPAR1WAY  (SAS v 9.3). Statistical significance was set as P < 0.05 for all outcomes.

For Lidocaine levels from venous blood , samples will be transported immediately after 
blood draw to the analytic lab ( Macdonald, Jeffrey M -Biomedical Engineering,

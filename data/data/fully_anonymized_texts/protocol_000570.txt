Protocol Summary 
Study Title:   The Life After Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586254]  (The LAST study)  
Phase:  II 
Number of Patients:   173  
Number of Sites:       14  
STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objectives:  
1. Proportion of patients with CML who develop molecular recurrence after discontinuing 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs). Molecular recurrence defined as loss of MMR (> 0.1% BCR -
ABLIS) 
2. Compare the patient -reported health status of patients before and after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586257].  
Secondary Objectives:  
1. To prospectively determine whether there are disease, patient -related, or treatment -related 
factors that predict molecular recurrence including sex, age, type of TKI, time to undetectable 
BCR- ABL by [CONTACT_954], duration undetectable BCR -ABL by [CONTACT_954] , Sokal risk at diagnosis, and 
BCR- ABL transcript levels measured by [CONTACT_95691].  
2. Develop a risk scoring system to predict the patient’s risk of molecular recurrence after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586256]  
3. Assess whether specific time points are more important for clinical prediction of recurrence 
and develop an optimal follow up schedule. 
4. Describe the patient -reported health status of patients after resuming TKIs in patients who 
restart TKIs.  
Overview of Study Design  
This is a non -randomized, prospective, single- group longitudinal study. The overall objective is to 
improve decision making for TKI discontinuation in eligible CML patients. Patients with CML on 
treatment with  imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib and in confirmed deep molecular response 
will stop their TKI. Confirmed deep molecular response is defined as  BCR- ABL < 0.01% (>MR4 i.e. > 
4 log reduction) for at least [ADDRESS_771318] RQ -PCR 
testing for molecular recurrence, testing them monthly for 6  months, then every other month until 24 
months, and then quarterly until 36 months. Concurrently, the study will assess a wide range of 
patient reported outcomes (PROs) before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586258], though at fewer time points. Patients who have molecular CML recurrence based on 
Medical College of Wisconsin  Confidential  Clinical Trial Protocol  
Version: [ADDRESS_771319] Study   Page 14 
 RQ-PCR will restart imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib and will continue to be monitored for 
disease status and patient -reported health status until the end of the study.

 1. Background and Study Rationale  
1.1 Background 
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically improved the survival of patients with chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML), leading to an unforeseen increase in prevalence. Current recommendations are to continue 
therapy indefinitely, sometimes despi[INVESTIGATOR_586259]. Moreover, the costs of TKI therapy are 
substantial and place a financial burden on the US health care system. Small, single- armed studies from 
Europe and Australia suggest that some patients with CML in a TKI -induced complete molecular response (MR 
4.5) maintain this response after discontinuation of TKIs. Given uncertainty about the patient characteristics associated with maintenance of MR 4.[ADDRESS_771325] of discontinuation on patients’ experiences of symptoms  and the factors driving a patient’s ch oice about discontinuation have not 
been studied. The L ife After Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586260] (LAST) Study  will provide answers to these 
practical questions in a comprehensive, outcome- based approach, thereby [CONTACT_57148] a rational basis for 
decision making. With annual costs of $100,000 per patient (1), an estimated prevalence of 70,000 patients in 
2010 (2), and with an estimated 36% of patients in stable MR 4.5 (3), a discontinuation rate of 50% could lead 
to savings of over $[ADDRESS_771326] year, even with increased monitoring costs and a 50% recurrence rate. Prevalence of CML continues to rise – 180,000 patients are expected by 
2050 (2) – increasing the public healt h relevance of this important issue.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_771327] of the t(9;22) translocation visible as the 
Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). This fusion gene confers a proliferati ve advantage to the cells acquiring this 
translocation. Prior to the introduction of imatinib (Gleevec®) in 2001, the only cure for CML was hematopoetic stem cell transplantation, and the median survival of all patients was 4- 5 years (4). Since the introduction of 
imatinib, about 87% of patients are expected to be alive at 8 years of follow up (5). Several other TKIs were 
subsequently developed and FDA -approved for the treatment of CML patients, including nilotinib (6) and 
dasatinib (7). As first line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], these have been compared head- to-head with imatinib in two phase 3 
studies and found to induce faster cytogenetic and molecular responses than imatinib, although it is not known whether this translates into improved long- term sur vival (8, 9) . Response to TKIs usually proceeds in an 
orderly fashion: first normalization of blood counts and spleen size, followed by [CONTACT_586289]-
positive  metaphases (complete cytogenetic response). Deeper responses  at the molecular level are measured 
by [CONTACT_586290] -ABL transcripts in the blood or marrow to very low or undetectable levels using real -
time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ- PCR) (10, 11) . Molecular response ( MR) is reported as % 
BCR- ABL/control gene, with ABL [ADDRESS_771328] commonly used control gene. For BCR- ABL to be 
considered undetectable, adequate amplification of a quality control gene is needed to ensure that the

 measurement is sufficiently sensitive.  MR 3.0 is a 3.0 log reduction in BCR- ABL transcripts  and is equivalent to 
BCR- ABL ≤ 0.1%. MR 4.0 is  BCR- ABL ≤0.01%, MR 4.5 is BCR- ABL ≤0.0032% , and MR 5.0 is BCR- ABL 
≤0.001 %.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_771330] of TKI therapy  
This study has the potential to reduce national expenditures associated with treatment with  TKIs. In early 2013, 
over 100 experts in CML, including many of the c o-investigators on this study, called for a reduction in the 
prices of TKIs to allow greater access to the drugs for more patients and to “maintain sound long- term 
healthcare policies” in light of the $2.7 trillion spent on health care in the U.S. in 2011 (1). As outlined above, 
savings could top half a billion dollars in the U.S. if half of eligible CML patients discontinued TKIs, even after 
accounting for recurrence and increased costs of monitoring for patients off therapy. Moreover, the cost savings to patients themselves should not be underestimated. Most patients in the U.S. pay at least some  of 
their medications costs out of pocket; some pay a very large proportion of those costs out of pocket.   
1.4 TKIs are associated with reduced quality of life  
Imatinib was a significant improvement over previous CML treatments in terms of survival and toxici ty (12, 13) . 
Even so, imatinib and other TKIs  are associated with diminished patient -reported health status due to multiple 
side effects of the treatment. While there are relatively few (<10) studies on health status  outcomes, patients 
consistently report increased fatigue and depression, difficulties with sleep, and high symptom burden particularly nausea, diarrhea, pain, fluid retention (puffy face), and skin problems (14) , especially as compared 
to peers without cancer (15) . Of particular concern is that patients and physicians may not value health- related 
quality of life in the same way, further limiting which data are collected in research studies and thus our understanding of the patient’s experience. A European study found that while both patients  and physicians 
ranked fatigue as their first concern, other symptoms and concerns were ranked quite differently (16) . The 
issues ranked substantially higher by [CONTACT_586291] – dry mouth, trouble concentrating or 
remembering, frequent urination, skin problems, and drowsiness, whereas the issues ranked substantially 
higher by [CONTACT_586292]. Furthermore,  deleterious side effects have been recognized only with longer follow -up, for 
example, pulmonary hypertension in patients on  dasatinib (17) and peripheral arterial occlusive disease in  
patients  on nilotinib  (18). These and other side effects are thought to be related to the inhibition of kinases 
other than the BCR- ABL kinase (19).  
 
1.5 Some patients may not need to continue taking TKIs forever  
Current guidelines for the treatment of CML recommend continuation of treatment with TKIs as long as patients are responding and tolerating the drug (20, 21) . The French STIM trial ( Stop Imatinib) stopped imatinib in [ADDRESS_771331] 2 years and monitored them closely (22) . Patients who had 
Medical College of Wisconsin  Confidential  Clinical Trial Protocol  
Version: [ADDRESS_771332] Study   Page 19 
 molecular recurrence restarted imatinib therapy. Molecular recurrence was defined as loss of MR5 confirmed 
by a second rising level. With a median follow up of 50 months, 39 patients had maintained their molecular 
remission and 61 patients  had molecular recurrence. Of those 61 patients, all responded to TKI rechallenge; 
no patient experienced disease progression or died from their disease (22) . Similar  results have been shown in 
five other small, non- US studies (23- 27). These studies have varied wit h regard to sample size , definition of 
recurrence, and TKI therapy before discontinuation. In the TWISTER study conducted in Australia (24), 40 
patients with sustained CMR stopped imatinib and were monitored frequently.  Treatment was restarted at loss 
of MMR  or two consecutive samples at any level . With a median follow up of 42 months, 18 (45%) of patients 
had not met the study definition of relapse. In all patients who relapsed, the first sample which tested positive 
was at a level below loss of MMR. Eight patients lost MMR prior to starting therapy. Of note [ADDRESS_771333] no evidence of disease progression, the  A-STIM trial (According to Stop Imatinib) was  designed where 
patients restart TKI therapy at loss of MMR  and not when there was detectable disease.   In the A -STIM trial 
patients with chronic phase CML who had been in CMR and/or had weakly positive samples prior to enrollment 
were eligible  (23). In that study, 80 patients were enrolled and stopped their TKI. The median duration of CMR  
prior to study enrollment was  41 months , and 52% had unstable CMR. With a median follow up of 31 months, 
29 patients (36%) lost MMR. Of the patients who lost MMR, only [ADDRESS_771334] MMR after 12 months . Overall, 45 patients (51%) lost CMR according to the STIM criteria. Of 
those, [ADDRESS_771335] MMR for a cumulative incidence of 65% at [ADDRESS_771336] crisis while 
on imatinib(28) .  In the KIDS study (Korean imatinib discontinuation study), [ADDRESS_771337] 3 years 
discontinued imatinib. Patients who relapsed (defined as loss of MMR on 2 consecutive assessments ) 
resumed TKI. With a median follow up of [ADDRESS_771338] crisis. In the study by [CONTACT_586293], 
Medical College of Wisconsin  Confidential  Clinical Trial Protocol  
Version: [ADDRESS_771339] Study   Page 20 
 patients on second generation TKIs (2G-TKI) i.e. dasatinib and nilotinib were enrolled on the study and 
stopped TKI therapy. Of the [ADDRESS_771340] 6 months of follow up, 25 patients (74%) received 
2G-TKI upfront or for intolerance and 9 (26%) received 2G -TKI due to suboptimal response/resistance to 
imatinib. The probability of stable MMR was 67% vs 33% for patients who were on 2G- TKI upfront/intolerance 
vs. suboptimal response/resistance respectively. None of the patients progressed to accelerated phase or blast 
crisis. More recently, the Euro- SKI study interim analysis results were presented(29) . In that study, patients 
with CML and sustained deep molecular response defined as BCR- ABL <0.01% ( MR4 )  for at least one year 
were enrolled in the study. The planned interim analysis of the first 200 patients completing 6 months of follow 
up was presented. Both duration of CML therapy and duration of deep molecular response were associated 
with prognostic significance. However, there was no prognostic significance for depth of response at 
discontinuation when comparing patients at MR4 vs MR4.5 vs. MR5. Based on this data, this protocol will include 
patients in confirmed deep molecular response defined as BCR- ABL <0.01%  (MR4 i.e. > 4 log reduction).  
Taken together, these results are compelling, but the evidence base is not sufficient for a large- scale change in 
the standard of care for CML patients in the US. Indeed, CML experts recommend that discontinuation be 
performed on clinical trials only (22, 30, 31) .

2. Study Objectives  
Primary Objectives:  
1. Proportion of patients with CML who develop molecular recurrence after discontinuing tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs). Molecular recurrence defined as loss of MMR (> 0.1% BCR -ABLIS) 
2. Compare the patient -reported health status of patients before and after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586257].  
Secondary Objectives:  
1. To prospectively determine whether there are disease, patient -related, or treatment -related factors that 
predict molecular recurrence including sex, age, type of TKI, time to undetectable BCR- ABL by [CONTACT_954], 
duration undetectable BCR -ABL by [CONTACT_954] , Sokal risk at diagnosis, and BCR -ABL transcript levels 
measured by [CONTACT_95691].  
2. Develop a risk scoring system to predict the patient’s risk of molecular recurrence after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586256]  
3. Assess whether specific time points are more important for clinical prediction of recurrence and develop 
an optimal follow up schedule.  
4. Describe the patient -reported health status of patients after resuming TKIs in patients who restart TKIs.  
 
3. Study Design 
This is a non -randomized, prospective, single- group longitudinal study. The  overall objective is to improve 
decision making for TKI discontinuation in eligible CML patients. Patients with CML on treatment with  imatinib, 
dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib and are in confirmed deep molecular response will stop their TKI. Confirmed deep molecular response is defined as BCR- ABL < 0.01%, ( > MR
4 i.e. > 4 log reduction) for at least [ADDRESS_771344] RQ -PCR testing for molecular recurrence, testing them 
monthly for 6  months, then every other month until 24 months, and then quarterly until 36 months. 
Concurrently, the study  will assess a wide range of PROs before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586262], though at fewer time points, utilizing online and/or phone questionnaires . 
Patients who have molecular CML recurrence based on RQ -PCR will restart ima tinib, dasatinib,  nilotinib , or 
bosutinib and will continue to be monitored for disease status and health status until the end of the study.

5.2 Screening, registration  and enrollment :  
5.2.[ADDRESS_771349] consented to trial participation.  If a 
patient is screened - regardless of whether or not they are registered  to the study – their details should be 
entered into the MCW Oncore CTMS.  Patients will receive a screening ID that will be used to identify the 
patient throughout the study.  At this time patients will be considered registered on  the study .  
 
Medical College of Wisconsin  Confidential  Clinical Trial Protocol  
Version: [ADDRESS_771350]’s entry 
into this study is recorded in the subject’s source documents. The original consent form, signed and dated by [CONTACT_202175]’s entry into the study, must be maintained in the investigator’s study files at each participating i nstitution.  
 
Patients  in screening will be assessed by [CONTACT_3433] e PCR Core Lab twice, at least 21 days  apart,  to confirm that the  
BCR- ABL is < 0.01% (> MR4 i.e. > 4 log reduction).  Concurrently;  patients will take the PRO questionnaires  
described in Appendix [ADDRESS_771351] been met; then the TKI will be  stopped  within [ADDRESS_771352] both BCR -ABL 
assessments and PRO assessments as clarified below (sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2). The monitoring phase will 
last for 3 years .  
 
Patients’ study participation may be terminated for any of the following reasons:  
• Death 
• Medically significant event  
• Physician discretion  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Patient non -compliance with study procedures  
• Patient is lost to follow up 
5.3.[ADDRESS_771353] 
6 months , every  2 months for the next 18 months (until 24 months) , and every [ADDRESS_771354] year. 
Patients  may be able to get some labs drawn closer to their home. Site will need to complete Appendix 5 if 
they want permission to send patients to a lab closer to home.  Sites local IRB should be consulted as well t o 
determine local IRB reporting requirements.   All samples will be shipped to the PCR Core Lab. Specimen 
Collection and Handling instructions are detailed in Appendix 2.  The PCR Core Lab will perform RQ -PCR and 
digital testing of peripheral blood. Digital PCR will be used for research questions only, with results available to 
Medical College of Wisconsin  Confidential  Clinical Trial Protocol  
Version: [ADDRESS_771355] Study   Page 25 
 clinicians only upon conclusion of the study. Thus therapy decisions will be made based on RQ -PCR only, per 
existing treatment guidelines.  During the monitoring phase, if BCR- ABL ≥0.01% for the first time,  then PCR 
testing would be repeated monthly for 3 months. If BCR- ABL ≥0.1%  (loss of MMR) restart TKI. If no loss of 
MMR then resume regular schedule of PCR evaluations. i.e.  if patient is in first [ADDRESS_771356] year then check RQ -PCR q 3  
months.  If BCR- ABL ≥0.1%  at any time point, patients will restart TKI therapy. For patients who restart TKI 
therapy, RQ -PCR will be performed  at the central lab approximately every 3 mont hs from the date of restarting 
their TKI,  for a total of 3 years from enrollment  or until BCR- ABL is < 0.01% twice, whichever comes first . All 
PCR Core Lab results will be entered into Oncore CTMS to facilitate secure sharing of data with the 
Coordinating Center . Following that, BCR -ABL results will be collected  locally  approximately every [ADDRESS_771357] them from starting a different TKI; this decision 
will be left to the patient and his or her physician.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Assessment of BCR -ABL for GeneXpert Validation  
Enrolled patients will have blood draws for their RQ -PCR and Digital PCR that will be shipped to the PCR Core 
Lab at the tim e points described in sections 5.3.1.  Aliquots of these samples will be taken by [CONTACT_586295].  Please see appendix [ADDRESS_771358] 6 months of the study.  Prior to each scheduled visit, an MCW study coordinator will email 
the local study coordinator with a link to access a secure platform hosted by [CONTACT_586296] . 
For all patients PRO assessments will primarily be administered at the time of blood draws. Ideally, the site 
coordinator would meet with the patient at the time of blood draws and administer the survey on an electronic tablet provided by [CONTACT_1758]  (though the assessment can also be completed in other ways if necessary, see 
section 5.4. on Prevention of Missing Data) .  
 For patients who restart their TKI, PRO data will be collected approximately every [ADDRESS_771359] 1 month 
apart.

 5.4 Patient Retention and Prevention of Missing Data 
For participants who do not complete their PRO assessment at the clinic, the local site coordinator will either 1) 
email the REDCap link to the participant to complete the assessment online at home , 2) access the 
assessment in REDCap and read them to the participant over the phone, reporting the participant’s responses directly into the online system, or 3) give the participant a paper version of the assessment and then upload the completed assessment to OnCore.

according to standard of care.   
6. Measures  
6.[ADDRESS_771363] molecular RQ -PCR monitoring in all patients on the IS scale. All samples with 
undetectable BCR -ABL will also be examined using digital PCR, which is a more sensitive nanofluidic PCR 
system (Fluidigm Corporation, South San Francisco, CA) with an increased sensitivity of > [ADDRESS_771364] PCR assay [26, 27]. Digital PCR will follow the same schedule as RQ- PCR monitoring unless CML 
recurs, then only RQ-PCR testing will be used henceforth. In the digital assay, detection sensitivity is 
augmented by [CONTACT_586297], such that multiple PCR reactions are performed simultaneously in hundreds of replicates. For example, if a mixture containing 1 molecule of BCR- ABL within 
100,000 molecules of control gene is partitioned into 1,000 independent chambers, the chamber containing the single BCR- ABL molecule now only contains ~100 molecules of control gene. This 1,000- fold increase in 
relative concentration theoretically allows for a 1,000- fold improvement in the detection sensitivity of PCR 
reactions, thereby [CONTACT_586298]. Digital PCR uses  the Poisson di stribution 
to calculate BCR- ABL and ABL 1 control gene transcript levels.

 6.2 Measurement of PROs  
The PROMIS measurement system will be used for self -reported health status. PROMIS is the NIH’s initiative 
to standardize measurement of PROs in clinical research across all chronic conditions. Where PROMIS 
measures are not available to assess CML- specific  symptoms, the EORTC QLQ- CML Symptom Burden scale, 
which covers abdominal pain, dry mouth, skin problems, headaches, joint pain or swelling, eye problems, etc will be used  (32). The full battery of items is expected to take fewer than [ADDRESS_771366] experience with these measures. The content of the PROs is provided in Appendix 1
; specific wording 
changes may be made in response to feedback from the Patient Advisory Panel. In a longer baseline 
assessment (~30 minutes) sociodemographic characteristics will be collected as well as monthly out of pocket 
expenses for TKIs.  In the 3-month  assessment, additional questions about medications will be asked.  
 
7. Statisti cal A nalysis  
7.[ADDRESS_771367] access to the identifiers linking clinical and personal data. A ll variable 
distributions  will be reviewed  before commencing analysis  to identify problematic values . A 2-tailed significance 
level of α=0.05  will be used  for all assessments. Statistical analyses will be conducted using SAS 9.3 (SAS 
Institute, Inc).  
 
7.2 Analysis for predicting recurrence in patients with CML who discontinue TKIs  
In terms of  primary objective 1 , the clinical outcomes to be examined in this study include the primary event 
of CML molecular recurrence (opposite relapse- free survival [RFS]) and death in complete rem ission (DCR). 
For the univariate analysis the probabilities of RFS will be calculated using the Kaplan- Meier estimator. 
Probabilities of molecular recurrence and DCR will be generated using cumulative incidence estimates to 
account for competing risks.  For secondary objective 1 , Cox proportional hazards model (33) and Fine and 
Gray’s subdistribution hazards model (34) and Fine and Gray’s subdistribution hazards model  [32] will be used 
to determine the effect of clinical characteristics on RFS and CML recurrence after TKI discontinuation, respectively. The baseline clinical risk factors that will be considered in regression analyses include sex, age, 
type of TKI, time to undetectable BCR -ABL by [CONTACT_64091] -PCR, duration with undetectable BCR -ABL by [CONTACT_64091] -PCR, 
Sokal Risk at diagnosis  
(see appendix 4) , and BCR- ABL transcript levels measur ed by [CONTACT_95691]. The 
following analysis plan will be implemented. First, for the continuous variables, including time to undetectable BCR- ABL by [CONTACT_64091] -PCR, a martingale residual plot will be applied to evaluate the potential threshold cut point(s) 
for the effect on RFS and the maximum partial likelihood method will be used to identify optimal cut point(s). Second, univariate probability of RFS, molecular relapse, and DCR with 95% confidence interval (CI) will be computed by [CONTACT_586299]. Third, a Cox regression model building procedure will be used to identity 
Medical College of Wisconsin  Confidential  Clinical Trial Protocol  
Version: [ADDRESS_771368] indicates differential 
effects over time (non- proportional hazards), models will be constructed breaking the post -stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586264], using the maximized partial likelihood method to find the most appropriate breaking time point. Following this, the proportionality assumptions will be tested again.  Factors that are significant at a 
5% level will be kept in the final model. The potential interactions between all significant risk factors will be tested. Fourth, in pursuit of  secondary objective [ADDRESS_771369] the patient’s risk of molecular recurrence after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586256]. A 3- 4 level scoring 
system will be considered as appropriate for the data. For  secondary objective 3 , we will assess whether 
specific time points are more important for clinical prediction of recurrence within this schedule. At each pre-scheduled follow- up time, we will calculate the recurrence rate and treatment failure rate (recurrence or DC R) 
with its 95% CI.  The  log transfer approach (35) to calculate the CI to force the CI to be within proper range (0, 
1) will be used  and based on that make recommendations for the optimal follow -up schedule.  
 
7.3 Analysis for patient -reported health status  
The components of  health status will be analyzed separately (that is, depression separate from fatigue 
separate from GI symptoms, etc), since combining them into a summary score can dilute the effects of the 
individual (and not necessarily related) components and thus mask true change. However, this “battery 
approach” to PRO assessment has the drawback of resulting in multiple, individual component scores and 1) raises the possibility of obtaining conflicting results of the different components and 2) creates a potential multiple comparisons problem for statistical testing. Pre -specifying the major expected relationships and 
corresponding statistical comparisons minimizes such potential problems . 
 There are two main objectives for the analysis of PRO measures in this study. The first is to describe what happens to patients’ health status after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586265]. The second is to describe what happens to the health status of patients who then resume therapy because of a CML recurrence (e.g., how quickly and 
strongly do side effects of TKI therapy recur ). Both objectives will be pursued in the context of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_586266]- effects model for each of the PRO endpoints. In this model, each patient’s trajectory over 
time is divided into one “pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]” for the assessments up to the point of recurrence and a second “pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]” for the 
assessments that follow recurrence. A similar pi[INVESTIGATOR_586267] -
ACTION trial was used(36) . This modeling approach offers several advantages: the likel ihood- based 
estimation means that all available data from each patient are used; correlations within patients over time are addressed; any missing data can be considered ignorable conditional upon the observed data; and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_586268] a single model that can answer multiple questions of interest (37).

be described, but there are no a priori  hypotheses about how they will change. In terms of our secondary 
objective 4 , we will examine each PRO domain’s change after patients resume TKI therapy following CML 
recurrence by [CONTACT_586301] “pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]” of the model (following recurrence). Again, we hypothesize worsening in fatigue, depression sleep disturbance, and GI symptoms by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_771371] differences (Δ) Between Groups (n=165)

7.4 Managing Missing PRO Data  
Missing PRO data  will be avoided through regular monitoring , as described above (See Patient Retention and 
Prevention of Missing Data) . Missing data at the item level  will be handled using the following approach. If at 
least 50% of the items per domain were answered, then we will adjust the score to ([Raw sum x number of items in the domain] / number of items answered). If fewer than 50% of the items in a domain were answered, we will treat the domain as missing. We have chosen the longitudinal mixed effects model to allow the 
inclusion of all cases in our analyses, even those with missing values (38) .

measures are scored on a standardized [ADDRESS_771379] deviation of 10.) We conducted a power analysis using a simulation of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_586270] 9.3. We chose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_586271] (see Analysis Plan for Aim 2). Prior to simulation, the sample size was divided by [CONTACT_586303] (39). We estimated a range of effect 
sizes that a fixed sample size could detect, and for each hypothetical effect size, through simulation, we generated many (>1200) random sample datasets based on the following assumptions: 13 PRO assessments over 3 years, a median time- to-recurrence of 6 months (40) , expected improvement in PROs after TKI 
discontinuation and decline in PROs after CML recurrence/reintroduction of TKI therapy, known variance and 
covariance parameters (36), 4 fixed effects (intercept, time before recurrence, recurrence, and time after 
recurrence), and 2 random effects (random intercept and slope prior to recurrence) to allow baseline and 
monthly change to vary by [CONTACT_4676] (41). For each generated sample, we fit the pi[INVESTIGATOR_586272], and collected data on rejection of the null hypothesis of no time effect (that is, no difference in PROs over time with TKI discontinuation and reintroduction), and 10% missing data per year to account for dropout and missed assessments. To estimate the power associated with a given effect size, we computed the proportion

 of the successful rejection rate. With >90% power, we need [ADDRESS_771381] a change of 0.3. This 
sample size also provides >85% power to detect a smaller effect size of 0.25.  
  
8. Study Organization and Administration

9. Regulatory  
The following must be observed to comply with Food and Drug Administration regulations for the conduct and 
monitoring of clinical investigations; they also represent sound research practice: 
9.1 Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described by [CONTACT_60836] (Federal  
Register Vol. 46, No. 17, January 27, 1981, part 50)  and the Office for Protection from Research  
Risks Reports: Protection of Human Subjects (Code of Federal Regulations 45 CFR 46). They  
must be followed to comply with FDA regulations for the conduct and monitoring of clinical investigations.  
Medical College of Wisconsin  Confidential  Clinical Trial Protocol  
Version: [ADDRESS_771387] be approved by [CONTACT_586308] (Ref. Federal Register Vol. 46, No. 17, January 27, 1981, part 56)  
and the Office for Protection from Research Risks Reports: Protection of Human Subjects (Code 
of Federal Regulations 45 CFR 46).  
10. Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events Reporting Guidelines 
10.1 Adverse Events       
10.1.1  Definition  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as the presence of a new or the worsening of any pre -existing unfavorable 
and unintended symptoms or medical conditions that occur after consent has been obtained.  
10.1.2  Reporting  
Any AE that the treating physician determines is  related to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586274] (eCRF) in Oncore CTMS .  During the screening phase of the protocol all AEs 
will be recorded on the Baseline AE eCRF but will not need to be followed past the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586275].  Medical conditions that already existed at the time of informed consent will be recorded in the Baseline AE 
eCRF.  AE monitoring should be continued until restarting TKI or study completion.   SAEs should be followed 
until study completion.  
 
AEs will be evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.   
10.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
10.2.1  Definition  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. (Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is a medically important event.  An important medical event that jeopardizes the subject or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
Medical College of Wisconsin  Confidential  Clinical Trial Protocol  
Version: [ADDRESS_771388] Study   Page 35 
 10.2.2  Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse  Events  
Serious adverse events experienced after signing consent should only be reported to the Medical College of 
Wisconsin if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_467433]’s TKI. All deaths, disease transformation to accelerated phase, and blast crisis should be reported immediately despi[INVESTIGATOR_586276].  
 
A member of the study staff from  each site should complete the SAE eCRF within 24 hours of learning of the 
event and email  (LAST [EMAIL_11187] ) or fax  ([PHONE_5302])  the completed form signed by [CONTACT_586309].  
The initial SAE should be followed until resolution and updated in the SAE eCRF.  Follow -up SAE information 
is sent to the same contacts listed above. Each site is responsible for reporting SAEs to their local Institutional 
Review Board per institutional guidelines.  
11. Data and Safety Monitoring  
 The Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible 
for monitoring data quality and subject safety for all cancer center investigator initiated clinical trials. A 6 to 8-
member  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will complete a review of protocol- specific data safety 
monitoring reports, to provide recommendations on trial continuation, suspension or termination. The DSMC 
will review these reports no less than bi -annually. A summary of the DSMC activities are as follows  
• Review the clinical trials for data integrity and safety  
• Review all adverse events requiring expedited reporting as defined per protocol  
• Review all DSM reports  
• Submit a summary of any recommendations related to study conduct  
• Terminate the study if deemed unsafe for patients  
11.[ADDRESS_771389] study with imatinib in CML patients, the annual rates of progression to accelerated phase (AP) or 
blast crisis  (BC) was 1.5, 2.8, 1.6, 0.9, and 0.5% for years 1, 2, 3, 4, and [ADDRESS_771390] year  of this study, and adverse event s of progression to 
AP or BC will be evaluated at the end of each year. As the rate of disease progression to AP and/or BC is 
about 1.2% per each year, the study will be put on hold if ≥ 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 patients develop disease 
transformation to AP and/or BC at end of year 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, cumulatively.  In the case of a safety event 
suspending the study , a prompt cumulative examination of all data and circumstances of these events will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_586310], 
whether the protocol will be revised , or whether the study will be discontinued permanently.  
Medical College of Wisconsin  Confidential  Clinical Trial Protocol  
Version: [ADDRESS_771391] Study   Page 36 
  
Each participating site’s IRB will be notified of any event that triggers postponement of enrollment in this study. 
If the study is suspended for safety reasons and it is deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_68490], approval from the relevant IRBs will be obtained prior to resuming the study  at each participating institution . 
 Decisio ns regarding ongoing study participation of patients on study will be made on a case by [CONTACT_586311]’s Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_586277].

 Appendix 6: GeneXpert Validation tests  
 
Use of BCR- ABL Assays, including GeneXpert  BCR- ABL V1 and V2 Assays, in the LAST Trial:  
• The use of real time quantitative PCR (RQ -PCR, Q -PCR or RT -Q-PCR) assays for monitoring residual 
disease, as measured by [CONTACT_431938] -ABL1 mRNA quantitation as % Ratio (BCR -ABL1/ABL1), is an important 
aspect of evaluating response to drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_586287] 
(CML).  
• Although a few specialized academic research laboratories have been able to standardize “standard” 
homebrew BCR -ABL Q -PCR assays within their own labs using the International Scale ( IS) developed 
by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO), there is still a need to standardize the methodology and reporting of BCR -ABL1 by [CONTACT_586316], including in resource poor 
settings in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], in order to improve the care and evaluation of therapeutic treatment 
options of patients with CML.  
• Cepheid, a molecular diagnostics company based in Sunnyvale, CA, has developed the GeneXpert Dx system and cartridge based assays which standardize and simplify highly accurate and reproducible Q -
PCR assays for the end user by [CONTACT_586317], nucleic acid isolation, detection and 
quantification of RNA and DNA targets in a variety of infectious diseases and oncology/hematology 
indications, including BCR- ABL1 testing for CML.   
• Cepheid currently has two versions of GeneXpert BCR -ABL Monitoring assays, Version 1 (V1) and 
Version 2 (V2).  These cartridge -based, yet “standard” Q -PCR assays will be evaluated alongside 
“standard” homebrew Q -PCR and investigational digital PCR assays performed in [CONTACT_586325]’s 
core laboratory facility in the context of the LAST clinical trial.  
It is anticipated that the GeneXpert  BCR- ABL Version [ADDRESS_771438] 
homebrew BCR -ABL Q -PCR assay(s) being performed on blood samples from the LAST trial, serving as 
evidence of analytical validity in comparison to the gold standard Q -PCR assay run in [CONTACT_586324]’s Core Lab.   
These data, as well as the correlation of  % Ratio (BCR -ABL1/ABL1) by [CONTACT_586318] -ABL V2 and the gold 
standard Q -PCR assays with clinical endpoints in the study, such as Time to CML molecular recurrence 
[defined as loss of MMR (> 0 .1% BCR -ABL, IS) as assessed by [CONTACT_38183] Q -PCR], Relapse free survival 
(RFS), and Death in complete remission (DCR),  may provide key evidence to support the claim of the GeneXpert BCR -ABL V2 Assay’s clinical validity and utility in monitoring CML disease burden and patient 
response to changes in drug therapy (in this case, discontinuation of therapy), and as such, de- identified study 
data may be shared with Cepheid and subsequently submitted by [CONTACT_586319] -
market review of the GeneXpert BCR- ABL V2 Assay, allowing widespread use of the assay in laboratories 
throughout the U.S.  Indeed, the FDA has invited Cepheid to submit data for pre- market review that includes a 
clinical cohort with well- characterized clinical outcomes.     
Brief  Technical Background and Regulatory Status of GeneXpert BCR -ABL V1 and V2 Assays:  
• GeneXpert  BCR- ABL Assays utilize standard, but simplified and automated, RT-Q- PCR which is 
performed in the GeneXpert assay cartridge following several off -board sample preparation steps.  
• The GeneXpert® BCR- ABL Monitor Assay(s), Version 1 (V1) or Version 2 (V2), can be performed in de -
centralized labs on the Cepheid GeneXpert® Dx System (instrument).   
Medical College of Wisconsin  Confidential  Clinical Trial Protocol  
Version: [ADDRESS_771439] Study   Page 65 
 • Both the V1 and V2 assays are currently considered (in the U.S.) Research Use Only (RUO) in vitro  
diagnostic tests for the simultaneous detection and quantitation of  the BCR -ABL1  chromosomal 
translocation mRNA transcripts (type b2a2 or b3a2) and the ABL1  endogenous control mRNA transcript 
in peripheral blood specimens from patients diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).   
• Reporting on International Scale:   
The GeneXpert BCR -ABL Assays (V1 and V2) report BCR -ABL1 mRNA quantitation as % Ratio (BCR -
ABL1/ABL1) on the International Scale ( IS) per WHO Standards.  
• GeneXpert Assay Regulatory Status,  Sensitivity, and Sample requirements  
1. The GeneXpert  BCR- ABL Monitor V1 Assay   
• Is not FDA cleared but is available in the [LOCATION_002] as a RUO in vitro  diagnostic 
assay.  This Assay is, however, available for routine clinical use outside the US in those 
countries that accept diagnostics with CE registration.   
• Blood sample volume and sensitivity:  This version (V1) of the assay requires a 0.[ADDRESS_771440] and quantify BCR -ABL1/ABL1 % ratios to a 3 log reduction, or 0.1% 
(IS), which defines Major Molecular Response (MMR), per WHO guidelines.  
• Due to the improved sensitivity of the BCR ABL V2 assay (please refer to V2 details 
below), Cepheid is not seeking FDA pre -market review for the V1 version of the assay.  
2. The GeneXpert BCR -ABL V2 Assay  
 
• Is a RUO in vitro  diagnostic assay that is not FDA cleared, but Cepheid intends to submit 
the necessary documentation to FDA to support a pre -market review and, ultimately it is 
hoped, regulatory clearance as an FDA -cleared assay.  
• Blood sample volume and sensitivity :  This version (V2) of the assay requires a [ADDRESS_771441] and quantify BCR- ABL1/ABL1 % ratios to a 4.5- log reduction, or 
0.003% ( IS), which defines Complete Molecular Response (CMR), per WHO guidelines.  
GeneXpert Instrument and Cartridges for the LAST study  
• Cepheid will supply the Radich Core Laboratory with a GeneXpert [ADDRESS_771442] homebrew Q -PCR assay will be tested.   
• All instrumentation and cartridges to support the testing of samples in the study will be provided at no cost to the Radich lab or LAST study investigators/NCI.    
• Patient de -identified study data and laboratory test results, (“List of Data Elements” as outlined below), 
may be required to be shared directly with Cepheid for analysis to support FDA submission.

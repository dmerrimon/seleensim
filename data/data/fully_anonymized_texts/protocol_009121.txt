PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Study Title  MARANI PRENATAL CONNECTED C ARE (M•care) Safety and Effectiveness 
Study (M•CARE SE Study)  
Procedure Name  [CONTACT_905597], Inc.  
Protocol Number  MH-001 
Objective  To demonstrate the safety and performance of the Marani Fetal 
Monitoring  Telehealth System (M•care ™ System ) for use in antenatal 
monitoring of pregnant women ≥ 32 weeks’ gestation. The M•care System 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_905569] (FHR), Maternal Heart Rate 
(MHR) and Uterine Contractions (UC) to Doppler FHR, Pulse Oximeter MHR, 
and tocodynamometer (TOCO) UC, respectively, measured with an FDA 
cleared standard of care cardiotocography (CTG) device.  
Study Design  This is a multi -center, single arm, prospective paired comparison trial to 
determine the equivalence of the Marani M• care  System with an FDA 
cleared Doppler FHR, TOCO UC and Pulse Oximetry MHR standard of care 
CTG device . 
Duration  The expected monitoring duration for each subject is a minimum of 60 
minutes and maximum of 120 minutes.  
Study Device 
Description  Marani Health’s  M•care  System is a fetal heart rate (FHR), maternal heart 
rate (MHR), and uterine activity (UA) monitoring system intended  for home 
use by a pregnant woman as  prescribed  by [CONTACT_263235].  
The M•care ™ System is comprised of 3 components:

Primary Performance 
Measures  • Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) as measured by [CONTACT_941] M•care System versus 
standard of care CTG device.  
• Maternal Heart Rate (MHR) as measured by [CONTACT_941] M•care System 
versus the standard of care CTG Pulse Ox.  
Secondary 
Performance 
Measures  The secondary performance measure is Uterine Contractions (UC) sensitivity 
as measured by [CONTACT_941] M•care System versus the standard of care CTG device.  
Hypothesis testing for UC sensitivity will only be conducted if the primary 
performance measures (i.e., equ ivalence in FHR and MHR) are met.  
Additional UC  endpoints as measured by [CONTACT_941] M•care System versus standard 
of care CTG device  include:  
• Positive predictive value (PPV)  
• False Positive Rate  
No hypothesis testing is planned for the PPV and false positive rate 
endpoints.  
Safety Outcome 
Measures  • Incidence of device related and/or protocol procedure related 
adverse events related to the M•wrap study device

 Study Success Criteria  Primary Performance Goals : 
• M•care  FHR limit of agreement (LOA) within the performance goal of 
15 beats per minute (bpm) of FHR measured with CTG.  
• M•care MHR limit of agreement (LOA) within the performance goal 
of 10 beats per minute (bpm) of MHR measured with CTG.  
Secondary Performance Goal : 
• M•care UC detection sensitivity with a performance goal of greater 
than or equal to 80% agreement.  
Study Methodology  Subjects will be assessed for study suitability based on the stated inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. Once informed consent is obtained, the study 
monitoring systems will be applied to the subject’s abdomen.  
Recording session:  
• Prior to deployment of the M•care system, subjects will be 
monitored with the external CTG device for fetal heart rate detection 
and the CTG pulse oximeter for maternal heart rate signal 
confirmation.  
• The M•wrap will be modified to allow positioning of the CTG 
transducers for simultaneous recording with both devices for FHR, 
MHR and UC (refer to Appendix 1).  
• The modified M•wrap will be secured to the subject’s abdomen and 
the subject will be monitored in stationary position for the duration 
of study recording session while following the M•wrap Instructions 
for Use.  
• Data is transmitted from the M•care system application to the 
Marani Cloud. There, the Marani proprietary signal processing is 
performed, and the data are analyzed to identify clean MHR, FHR 
and UC signals. Comprehensive analysis of the values will be 
performed offline.  
Each recording session will last for a minimum of 60 minutes and no longer 
than 120 minutes. Following the completion of the session, the study staff 
will remove the M•care monitoring system from the maternal abdomen and 
the study session will be concluded.  
The equivalence of the M•care System data will be compared to that of the 
simultaneously obtained reference device data . Complete monitoring strips 
will be obtained for each device and monitoring session to allow comparison 
for determination of equivalence. Comparison assessments between the 
M•care and CTG device will evaluate FHR, MHR and UC. Blinded review of UC 
data will be conducted by [CONTACT_905571]; in the 
event of discordance, a third blinded reviewer will serve as an adjudi cator.

DCR -[ZIP_CODE], Effective – 14-Dec-2022  
 At all times, the M•care system shall be considered a research device . In the 
clinic al setting  (i.e., not a research -only visit) , the M•care system is an 
adjunct to routine care and not a replacement for routine or urgent care 
needs. Only the data from the standard of care reference devices will be 
available to the clinical care team. Data recorded by [CONTACT_941] M•care system will 
not be accessible by [CONTACT_38991], thus clinical decisions for all 
subjects will solely be based on standard of care practices.  
Statistical 
Considerations  Success Criteria:  
Study success will be based on the following two primary performance goals:  
Primary performance goal, FHR  
The primary performance goal will be met if the 95% confidence interval for 
the 95% limits of agreement (LOAs) between the M• care  System and the 
standard of care reference device for the primary performance endpoint, 
FHR are within the performance goal interval of [ -15, 15] bpm.  
Primary performance goal, MHR  
The primary performance goal will be met if the 95% confidence interval for 
the 95% limits of agreement (LOAs) between the M• care  System and the 
standard of care reference device for the primary performance endpoint, 
MHR are within the performance goal interval of [ -10, 10] bpm.  
Secondary performance goal, UC  
The performance goal for the secondary endpoint, UC, will be met if the 
lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval for sensitivity is greater 
than 80% for M•care as compared to standard of care reference device.  
Sample Size Justification:  
A sample size of N=80 evaluable subjects with an average of 60 minutes of 
comparative device data will provide adequate power to establish 
equivalence between M•care and standard of care in the primary 
performance measurements of FHR and MHR , and the secondary 
performance measurement  of UC event sensitivity. It is anticipated that up to 
130 subjects from a minimum of 3 sites may be recruited to allow for 
inability of approximately  30% of subjects to complete the Monitoring 
Session per the study protocol.  
Background  
Mhajna et al reported the mean difference and (95% LOA) [SD] between 
INVU and standard of care reference CTG for FHR and MHR measurements as 
-0.30 bpm ( -8.84, 8.24) [SD=4.36] and 0.28 ( -5.30, 5.86) [SD=2.85], 
respectively.1 Furthermore, Hayes -Gill et al2 and Mhajna [ZIP_CODE],4 reported 
positive agreement (e.g., sensitivity) rates vs IUPC in uterine contraction 
events of 88%.

Refer to QMS Number: VAL -PRO -20-0004, Rev G 
DCR -[ZIP_CODE], Effective – 14-Dec-[ADDRESS_1270918]. FHR and MHR  are assumed to be normally distributed, with FHR 
mean ( SD) of -0.3 (4.4), MHR  mean ( SD) of 0.3 (3).  U C sensitivity is assumed 
to be distributed binary, with UC sensitivity of 90%. For all measurements, 
the within subject correlation is assumed to be 0.5 and compound 
symmetric.  
Based on these assumptions and simulations with SAS 9.4 statistical software 
of MMRM and bootstrap resampling analyses, N=80 evaluable subjects will 
provide greater than 80% power (using either statistical method MMRM or 
bootstrap resampling) to establish equivalence between M•care  and 
standard of care in each of the primary performance measurements of FHR 
and MHR and UC event sensitivity according to the success criteria and 
performance goals described above .

Monitoring systems used in labor and delivery are based on antiquated technology developed in the 
1960s. These systems are bulky,  and many technologies are still hardwired, technologically demanding , 
and plagued with inconsistent, inaccurate data output. The Marani M•care system utilizes novel, non -
invasive sensors to leapfrog existing technology and provide inexpensive, easy -to-use garments that 
measur e and record fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) along with other key biometrics.  
Current clinical assessment of potential fetal distress during pregnancies is done through infrequent 
monitoring of the vital signs of mother and unborn child. Existing technologies, including doppler 
ultrasound , are used in clinical settings.  
There are two types of monitoring -external and internal as standard of care:  
External monitoring is generally performed intermittently during pregnancy to monitor  fetal heart status 
for brief periods or to perform  a non-stress test (NST) and is often used during labor and delivery. Short 
term external monitoring can be done by [CONTACT_215658] a stethoscope or a handheld 
doppler. External monitoring is also frequently performed using Cardiotocography (CTG) . With CTG, a 
doppler ultrasound sensor measures FHR and a second sensor measures contractions.

DCR -[ZIP_CODE], Effective – 14-Dec-[ADDRESS_1270923] (NST) measure s FHR in response to either fetal movement or uterine contraction (UC). 
The goal of the NST is to determine how the heart of a fetus responds to the stimulus of a UC or to its own 
movements. In a normal (reactive) NST, a fetal heart rate will increase in re sponse to a UC or to fetal 
movement.  At week 32 of pregnancy or later, if a baby's heartbeat accelerates to a certain level above 
the baseline twice or more for at least 15 seconds each within a 20 -minute window, the results are 
considered reactive. If a baby's heartbeat does  not meet the criteria described above, the results are 
considered nonreactive and further tests may be considered.  
External FHR monitoring is also done for a contraction stress test (CST), which records changes of the fetal 
heart rate during uterine contractions (UC). The aim of this test is to monitor the fetus to check for heart 
rate abnormalities in response to UC u sing cardiotocography. CST antenatal fetal surveillance technique 
may help predict the fetal capability to tolerate the stress of labor and vaginal delivery.  
Invasive internal monitoring using fetal scalp electrodes (FSE) and intrauterine pressure catheters (IUPC) 
are commonly used for intrapartum monitoring and management. These invasive technologies have 
known side effects including infection, particularly if the mother has an existing infection.  In addition, use 
of these tec hnologies requires that the amniotic sac be ruptured,  and the mother’s cervix be dilated to at

2.2 STUDY RATIONALE  
Marani is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a proprietary, wearable sensor platform technology to non -invasively acquire 
maternal and fetal biometric data, including fetal ECG (fECG). The Marani Health M•care System will allow 
clinicians to assess fetal heart rate non -invasively  and wirelessly for prenatal monitoring.  
The Marani Health M•care System measures indicators  of fetal and maternal wellbeing including fetal 
movements, maternal and fetal cardiovascular activity , and uterine contractions. The wearable system 
will simultaneously record both fetal and maternal parameters non -invasively. The Marani M•care 
product provides robust FHR, MHR and UC measurements compared to the standard of care CTG 
monitoring devices.  
2.3 BENEFIT/RISK ASSESSMENT  
This is a minimal risk study .  The subjects in this study are not expected to be at any higher or additional 
risks than those who undergo cardiotocography (CTG) monitoring in clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225]. There is 
minimal risk with CTG monitoring.   
The M •wrap device employs electrocardiograph electrode sensors that are Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) cleared . An electrocardiograph electrode is an electrode applied directly to the subject ’s skin to 
passively acquire and transmit the electrical signal at the body surface to a processor that produces an 
electrocardiogram (ECG) or vectorcardiogram. An electrocardiograph electrode is not intended to deliver

3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
3.1 OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and performance of the Marani Fetal 
Monitoring  Telehealth System (M•care ™ System ) for use in antenatal monitoring of pregnant women ≥ 
32 weeks’ gestation. The M•care System will be evaluated by [CONTACT_905569] (FHR), 
Maternal Heart Rate (MHR) and Uterine Contractions (UC) to Doppler FHR, Pulse Oximeter MHR, and 
tocodynamometer (TOCO) UC, respectively, measured with an FDA cleared standard of care 
cardiotocography (CTG) device.  
3.2 PRIMARY PERFORMANCE MEASURES  
1) M•wrap FHR limit of agreement (LOA) within the performance goal of 15 beats per minute (bpm) 
of FHR measured with CTG  
2) M•care MHR  limit of agreement (LOA) within the performance goal of 10 beats per minute (bpm) 
of MHR  measured with CTG

DCR -[ZIP_CODE], Effective – 14-Dec-2022  
 3.3 SECONDARY PERFORMANCE MEASURES  
The secondary performance measure  is Uterine Contractions (UC) sensitivity as measured by [CONTACT_941] M•care 
System versus the standard of care CTG device , with a performance goal of greater than or equal to 80% 
agreement . Sensitivity is defined as the proportion of UC events identified by [CONTACT_905573] (e.g., within 30 seconds) identified by [CONTACT_941] M•care System.  
Hypothesis testing for UC sensitivity will only be conducted if the primary performance measures (i.e., 
equivalence in FHR and MHR) are met.  
Additional UC endpoints as measured by [CONTACT_941] M•care System verses standard of care CTG device include : 
1) Positive predictive value (PPV)  defined as the proportion of UC events identified by [CONTACT_36552] 
M•care System and standard of care out of those that are identified by [CONTACT_941] M•care System  
2) False Positive Rate defined as the proportion of UC events identified by [CONTACT_941] M•care System that 
are not identified by [CONTACT_905574].  
3.4 SAFETY ENDPOINT MEASURES  
Incidence of device related and/or protocol procedure related adverse events  (AEs)  related to the study 
device, The Marani Health M•care System, in pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy ≥[ADDRESS_1270926] any related serious events (see safety  in section  8).  
3.5 SUCCESS  CRITERIA  JUSTIFICATION   
Fetal Heart Rate  (FHR)  
The primary performance endpoint is M•care FHR limit of agreement (LOA) within 15 beats per minute 
(bpm) of FHR measured with cardiotocography. This [ADDRESS_1270927] a high degree of 
inaccuracy when compared with those derived from fetal ECG -based measurements.7 Thus, given the 
known limitations of CTG, some of variability quantified by [CONTACT_905575] M• wrap  measurements.   
In a study reported by [CONTACT_30822], et al, the limits of agreement for both FHR and MHR with FSE, abdominal 
fetal ECG and ultrasound were clinically evaluated.13 In this study, the abdominal fetal ECG limits of

DCR -[ZIP_CODE], Effective – 14-Dec-2022  
 agreement (± 1.96 SD) for fECG to FSE was 8.40; −8.72 and for the Doppler ultrasound technique the bias 
is significantly greater, −2.87, with limits of agreement of (22.65, −28.39 )7 indicating an even wider interval 
may be considered clinically  insignificant.  The FHR performance goal interval of [ -15, 15] bpm is based on 
the clinically significant margin for differences in FHR that have been variously reported in the literature 
as: >15bpm (e.g., large acceleration)14, and >25bpm (e.g., marked baseline variability) .15 
The mean difference (bias) between FHR measurements with fECG and Doppler methods has been 
reported as 0.74 bpm with 95% LOA of +/ - 12 bpm ( e.g.,  SD= 6.1 bpm) by [CONTACT_905576]14, and -0.3 bpm 
with 95% LOA of ( -8.84, 8.24) ( e.g.,  SD=4.36) by [CONTACT_905577] .1  The Monica Health Novii wireless patch 
system Instructions for Use (107 -PT-005-EN rev P) indicates that when comparing the Monica Novii 
System and the predicate Monica AN24 System, the 95% LOA was -13.7BPM to 14.1  BPM.  
Maternal Heart Rate  (MHR)  
The primary performance endpoint is M•care MHR limit of agreement within 10 beats per minute (bpm) 
of MHR measured with Pulse Oximetry MHR with the CTG.   It has been shown that a woman’s heart rate 
increases by [CONTACT_102836] 10 to 20 bpm during pregnancy .16 The mean heart  rate at 34 -42 weeks’ gestation 
was reported by [CONTACT_905578]. Al as 92 ± 1.17  Sherman, et. al showed that heart rate variability is 15.8 ± 
1.8 during the latent phase and 12.7 ± 1.[ADDRESS_1270928] chosen an increase or decrease in heart rate of ≥10 beats per minute (bpm) at the 
peak of a contraction as compared to [ADDRESS_1270929] been considered.  Odendaal et al. reported that 
tachycardia is defined as a “rate of at least 100 beats per minute under resting conditions” while the 
definition of bradycardia in pregnancy “has not been standardized.”20  
Uterine Contraction s 
Uterine contractions are identified based on the tracings out put by [CONTACT_905579] ; knowledgeable 
readers interpret the tracings to identify the contractions. The outcomes are binary : either the event 
happened , or it did not. To evaluate  the performance of th is binary outcome, our success criteri on is to 
obtain results consistent with cleared devices with similar technologies  such as the Monica AN24  per 
K101801  510(k) Summary , Monica No vii Instructions for Use ( 107-PT-005-EN rev P ), and TOCO13 in 
general .

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that non-invasive  electrical recordings w ill permit acquisition of the fetal 
ECG, maternal ECG  and uterine contractions (UC) with proper signal process ing and will ultimately support 
the development of a n abdominal  fetal monitor  that is wireless and unobtrusive . This will be accomplished 
with the Marani M•wrap wearable garment.  
This study  is a prospective paired comparison, multi -site trial intended to establish  the equivalence of the 
Marani M•care System with FDA -cleared Doppler FHR, TOCO UC and pulse Ox MHR reference . Subject s 
who are admitted to triage for potential labor  or other inpatient evaluations including but not limited to 
evaluation for PROM , who are attending in-clinic appointments for Non -Stress Tests (NST) , Contraction 
Stress Test (CST) , or at the convenience of the subject  will be monitored with both devices simultaneously 
for FHR, UC, and MHR. Only the data from  the CTG device, the standard of care,  will be available to the 
clinical team  in a clinical setting . CTG information will not be interpreted in a non-clinic research  visit 
setting . The M•care System  data will be compared to that of the simultaneously obtained standard of 
care CTG data  to determine equivalence  after the monitoring is completed . No interim analysis is planned.

5.4 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT  
Recruitment will include pregnant women (≥32 weeks)  who are coming to clinic for routine antenatal 
visits , scheduled research visits,  or who are  presenting for scheduled induction of labor, admitted for 
premature rupture of membranes ( PROM ) or other inpatient evaluations , in observation in labor triage . 
Visits will be scheduled  at the convenience of the mother .  
The study will enroll a minimum  of 80 evaluable  subjects . Two study groups will be included in order to 
ensure collection of sufficient uterine contraction activity data. The study groups are as follows:  
• Antenatal – includes subjects evaluated per obstetric standard of care in the clinic/office 
environment and subjects completing research -only visits in a non -clinic setting with oversight 
by a healthcare professional . Subjects with premature rupture of membrane (PROM) will also be 
included.  
• Enriched Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] – includes subjects in early (latent) phase of labor with suspected or 
confirmed uterine contractions, subjects who are being induced for labor.  
6 STUDY REGIMEN  
 
6.1 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
The group of subjects enrolled into the study may include subjects scheduled for routine antenatal visits; 
participation in the study may be offered while in the office for their scheduled visit. Other eligible subjects 
may be recruited from the general population for a scheduled research visit in a non -clinical setting. Each 
subject may identify a time that works best for them. During the visit (subjects must be 32 weeks or 
greater), fECG, mECG signals and UC will be recorded. The aim is to record signals for up to 120 min. The 
definition of success is: (1) capture of signals with CTG and (2) validation that the M•wrap is capturing 
signals.  
The sequential order for recording, based on our estimation of the likelihood of success, is as follows:  
1. Apply the CTG doppler transducer and confirm the CTG doppler transducer is operating normally.  
Remove the doppler transducer and put on M•wrap.  
2. Utilize M•wrap + CTG (FHR, MHR, and UC) to collect data.

placement of the appropriately sized  M•wrap placement per the current Instructions for Use (IFU) 
Manual. With guidance from Marani, holes/openings will be created in the wrap fabric to allow for 
placement of the CTG transducers such that both devices can be used simultaneously.  See Figure 3 for an 
example of wrap placement and use of the wrap with CTG transducers.  Appendix 1 describes M•wrap 
configurations for concurrent CTG  use in more detail. The black compression band will be placed over the 
M•wrap and the CTG transducers  throughout simultaneous data collection  (see Figure 4). Marani 
personnel will be present to perform necessary device modifications to allow for CTG placement and to 
initiate data collection from the M•care Mobile Application.  
Based on the design of the M•care Mobile Application, each  60-to-120-minute  Monitoring Session may 
include up to four  data collection initiations from the M•care Mobile Application .  The mother may get 
up and walk around between data collection sessions.

6.2 ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
6.2.1  ACQUISITION AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
An adequate number of M•wrap and M•core devices will be supplied to each  study site prior to  initiating 
the study and may be  resupplied as needed. Each shipment of device supplies for the study will contain a 
shipment form to assist in maintaining current and accurate inventory records. When a device shipment 
is received, the investigator/coordinator will acknowledge receipt .  
Accountability records  will be maintained  at the site  at all times. The identification number of the subject, 
the date, lot number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_905565] M•wrap dispensed, and the date and quantity of devices 
returned will be recorded. The devices will be noted on the appropriate inventory forms. Per Marani 
Health or Marani Health designee visit at the site, accountability of the returned devices should be 
performed and recorded.  
Upon conclusion of the  study, all devices must be returned to the sponsor or the sponsor’s designee. 
Ancillary supplies  (i.e., CTG bands, isopropyl alcohol, mild detergent , ultrasound gel for CTG transducers ) 
may  not need to be returned.

7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF M•WRAP APPLICATION /SUBJECT  WITHDRAWAL  
Subject s may withdraw from the study at any time. In the event that a subject experiences  any adverse 
events , the protocol may  be stopped,  and the investigators will analyze the root cause. In addition, fetal 
wellbeing will be monitored  and, if there are any effects considered to be the result of the study, the study 
may be stopped  and there will be  routine management of any subject  if being seen in a clinical setting . If 
the subject is being se en in a non-clinic research setting, no CTG data will be interpreted  and any adverse 
events  requiring medical attention will be referred to the subject's  physician. All adverse events  will be 
followed with  relevant records requested until resolution whe never possible.  Each  site investigator in a 
clinical setting will be responsible for determining  appropriate clinical care. Site clinical staff may also 
make the decision to withdraw a subject  for any other reason.  
The reason for withdrawal/discontinuation should be recorded on the appropriate case report form (CRF) . 
Data collected up to the point of withdrawal may be used.  
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
In order to assess efficacy, data will be collected  simultaneously with both the M•wrap and CTG ; this 
allows for a direct comparison of data obtained . CTG is  considered  standard of care and only that 
information will be used for clinical interpretation  if the research is carried out  in a clinical setting . The 
M•wrap data will not be shared with the practitioner or the subject  and will not be used for any clinical 
interpretation or interventions.   In the event the M•wrap location  and position  prevents CTG data 
acquisition necessary for care, the M•wrap will be removed , replaced, or repositioned.   The study session 
will be stopped if standard of care cannot be achieved with the M•wrap in place.  
8.[ADDRESS_1270938] is wearing the M•wrap, s afety will be  monitored. In the clinical setting, a  
qualified site staff member designated as having appropriate clinical expertise will make determinations 
regarding appropriate clinical care  and c are will be provided for any adverse events . If adverse events 
occur in the non -clinical setting , subjects  will be referred to a clinician  for treatment  as needed .

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Refer to section 10.[ADDRESS_1270940] of adverse event terms and definitions.  
Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study period. All adverse events that occur during 
the time a subject is wearing the M•wrap will be collected and reported to Marani according to section 
8.3.2 . Potential AEs for this study are listed in the ‘Benefit/Risk Assessment’ in Section  2.3. Events or 
complications unrelated to the M•wrap system will not be collected after removal of the M•wrap device.  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are not 
expected. If any problems related to subjects do occur , these will be reported to the Institutional Review 
Board ( IRB) in accordance with the local institution’s applicable polic ies and procedure s. 
8.3.2  REPORTING OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
All A Es and device deficiencies  should be reported to Marani Health on the a ppropriate CRF  within 24 
hours of awareness . Marani Health will be responsible for device servicing and replacements . 
AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in 
narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB per local IRB reporting requirements.   
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
Adverse events will be classified  by [CONTACT_12917], severity, and relationship to study device  and protocol 
procedures . Marani Health will be responsible for device servicing and replacements.  
For adverse events , the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of 
note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY APPLICATION  
All adverse events will have their relationship to study application and protocol  procedures assessed by 
[CONTACT_905581] . The degree of 
certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study application administration and cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the 
study application (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically de finitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary.  
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a 
reasonable time after administration of the study application , is unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on 
withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
• Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the study application ). However, other 
factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the subject ’s clinical condition, other concomitant 
events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged 
as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, 
as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study application administration makes a causal relationship improbable 
(e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study 
application ) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible 
explanations (e.g., the subject ’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study  application administration, and/or 
evidence exists indicating that the event is definitely related to another etiology. An alternative, 
definitive etiology must be documented by [CONTACT_5984] .

9.1 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
For all analysis populations the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905566] . Additional supportive 
analyses will be conducted for each study group separately.  
The safety analyses will be conducted for the Safety Population defined  as the population of subjects who 
enter the setup process (see Section 1.2, Schema) regardless of evaluability for performance measures . 
The Performance Evaluable Population will be the primary analysis population for performance 
measures and  will be d efined as the population of subjects who:  
• Enter the monitoring phase per Section 1.2, Schema ; 
• Have at least 1 minute of concurrent data with both devices ; and  
• Do not have any major protocol violations . 
9.2 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
9.2.1  PRIMARY PERFORMANCE MEASURES  
• Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) as measured by [CONTACT_941] M•care System versus standard of care CTG device.  
• Maternal Heart Rate (MHR) as measured by [CONTACT_941] M•care System versus the standard of care CTG Pulse 
Ox.  
9.2.2  SECONDARY PERFORMANCE MEASURES  
The secondary performance measure is Uterine Contractions (UC) sensitivity as measured by [CONTACT_941] M•care 
System versus the standard of care CTG device. Sensitivity is defined as the proportion of UC events 
identified by [CONTACT_905582]  (e.g., within 30 seconds) identified by [CONTACT_941] M•care 
System.

multiple measurements within subjects, MMRM (mixed -effect model repeated measures) statistical 
methods will be utilized for the primary analyses, with bootstrap resampling methods conducted as a 
supportive analysis. Unl ess otherwise specified all statistical tests will be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha of 
5%. 
9.4.[ADDRESS_1270946] ACCOUNTABILITY , DEMOGRAPHIC  AND  BASELINE  CHARACTERISTICS    
For each analysis population, the number of subjects  will be summarized for each accountability status 
(e.g., consented, screen failed, enrolled, completed study, or withdrawn) . Subjects excluded from an 
analysis population will be provided in a listing including reason for exclusion ( e.g.,  non-evaluable for 
performance measures, major protocol deviation, etc .). 
For this study, enrollment is defined as subjects who enter the Setup phase per Section 1.2, Schema . 
Subjects who do not meet these minimum criteria will not be considered enrolled and will not be included 
in any analysis of performance for safety measures.  
Demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, weight, pre pregnancy BMI) will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics for each analysis population.  
Baseline obstetrical characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics for each analysis 
population, including obstetrical history, appointment or admission type, and belly circumference.  
9.4.3  PERFORMANCE MEASURES ANALYSES  
Primary Performance Measures  Analysis  
A comparison between M•care measurement of FHR vs the standard of care reference measurements 
will be made using methods described below to test the following equivalence hypothesis corresponding 
to the S uccess Criteria  defined in Section 3. 5 of this protocol : 
H0: Upper 95% LOA > 15 bpm or Lower 95% LOA < -15 bpm       vs  
 H1: -15 bpm ≤ Lower 95% LOA and Upper 95% LOA ≤ 15 bpm  
A Bland -Altman plot of the mean versus the difference will be presented, and the 95% limits of agreement 
(LOA) calculated together with respective 95% confidence intervals , which will be compared to the 
equivalence threshold (e.g., performance goal) . Both MMRM analysis (primary) as well as bootstrap 
resampling techniques (supportive) will be conducted to account for the correlation among repeated FHR 
measurements within subjects. For the MMRM analysis, the mean difference (bias) and its standard 
devi ation w ill be estimated from the intercept of the model , assuming a compound symmetric correlation

In addition, a Deming regression model will be fitted to the FHR values obtained from both devices; the 
slope (β1) and intercept β0) together with respective 95% confidence intervals will be presented. The 
confidence intervals of the regression parameters will be calculated with bootstrap resampling 
methodology, to accommodate  repeated measurement within subjects. The results will be presented 
graphically via scatter plot with the line of slope 1 and intercept 0 superimposed.  
A comparison between M•care measurement of MHR vs the standard of care reference measurements 
will be made using the methods described above to test the following equivalence hypothesis Success 
Criteria defined in Section 3.5 of this protocol:  
H0: Upper 95% LOA > 10 bpm or Lower 95% LOA < -10 bpm      vs  
 H1: -10 bpm ≤ Lower 95% LOA and Upper 95% LOA ≤ 10 bpm  
Secondary Performance Measures  Analysis  
A comparison of sensitivity in UC events detected with M•care measurement vs the standard of care will 
be made using methods described below to test the following hypothesis:  
H0: Sensitivity < 80%      vs    H1: Sensitivity ≥ 80%  
To compare sensitivity (percent positive agreement) in UC events between M•care and standard of care, 
both MMRM analysis for binary data (primary) and bootstrap resampling techniques (supportive) will be 
used to account for the correlation among repeated U C measurements within subjects. For the MMRM 
model, the sensitivity will be estimated from the intercept of the model, presented with corresponding 2 -
sided 95% confidence interval (e.g., corresponding to a 1 -sided alpha 2.5%).  
Estimates of false positive rate and PPV in UC events detected with M•care measurement vs the standard 
of care will be made using both MMRM analysis for binary data (primary) and bootstrap resampling 
techniques (supportive), to account for the correlation among repeated UC measurements withi n 
subjects. For the MMRM model, estimates will be from the intercept of the model, presented with 
corresponding 2 -sided 95% confidence interval.  
Primary and secondary performance measures will also be summarized using descriptive statistics for FHR 
and MHR, and using a 2x2 cross tabulation table for UC events.

9.4.5  ADDITIONAL  ANALYSES  AND  CONSIDERATIONS  
The following analyses will be conducted as supportive analyses to the primary  analyses described in 
Section 9.4.3:  
Subgroup Analyses  
Primary performance measures will be presented separately by [CONTACT_905585]:  
• BMI strata ( Low ≤ 29; Medium > 29 and ≤ 35; High > 35 and ≤ 45)  
• Race  
• Study group (Antenatal and Enriched Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) , defined as follows:  
o Antenatal – includes subjects evaluated per obstetric standard of care in the clinic/office 
environment and subjects completing research -only visits in a non -clinic setting with 
oversight by a healthcare professional . Subjects with premature rupture of membrane 
(PROM) will also be included.  
o Enriched Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] – includes subjects in early (latent) phase of labor with suspected or 
confirmed uterine contractions, and subjects who are being induced for labor.  
Primary performance measures data will be  analyzed for all subjects regardless of major protocol 
deviations , where available . 
Missing Data and Invalid Data  
Only valid synchronized data will be analyzed. Missing performance measurement data will not be 
imputed. Determination  of invalid signals  will be address ed by [CONTACT_905586] .  
9.5 SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
A sample size of N=80 evaluable subjects with an average of 60 minutes of comparative device data  will 
provide adequate power to establish equivalence between M•care and standard of care in the primary 
performance measurements of FHR and MHR , and the secondary performance measurement of UC event 
sensitivity according to the success criteria and performance goals presented in Statistical Considerations 
Section 9.3. It is anticipated that up to [ADDRESS_1270947] s may be recruited to allow for inability of approximately  
30% of subject s to enter the Monitoring Session  phase of the study.

 Background  
Mhajna et al  reported the mean difference and (95% LOA) [SD] between INVU and standard of care 
reference CTG for FHR and MHR measurements as -0.30 bpm ( -8.84, 8.24) [SD=4.36] and 0.28 ( -5.30, 5.86) 
[SD=2.85], respectively.1 Furthermore, Hayes -Gill et al2 and Mhajna et al3,4  reported positive agreement 
(e.g.,  sensitivity) rates vs IUPC in uterine contraction events of 88%.  
Power Considerations  
In this study, each recording session will last for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1270948]. FHR and MHR are assumed to be normal ly distributed , with FHR mean (SD) of -0.3 
(4.4), MHR mean (SD) of 0.3 (3).  UC sensitivity is assumed to be distributed binary, with UC sensitivity of 
90%. For all measurements, the within subject correlation is assumed to be 0.5 and compound symmet ric.  
Based on these assumptions and simulations with SAS 9.4 statistical software of MMRM and bootstrap 
resampling analyses as described above in Statistical Considerations Section 9.4, N=80 evaluable subjects 
will provide greater than 80% power (using either statistical method MMRM or bootstrap resampling) to 
establish equivalence between M•care and standard of care in each of the primary performance 
measurements of FHR and MHR and UC event sensitivity according to the success criteria and 
performance goals presented in Statistical Considerations Section 9.3.

 12 APPENDICES  
APPENDIX 1 – M•WRAP CONFIGURATION FOR CONCURRENT CTG USE  
Marani Health proposes a series of performance data testing to support the substantial equivalence 
determination. The M•wrap capabilities of accurately recording with high fidelity the FHR , MHR  and UC  
will be determined by [CONTACT_905596], the Philips Avalon FM 20 , FM30 , 
FM40,  or FM50 .  
A segment of the M•wrap compression garment fabric will be cut out to enable simultaneous recording 
of FHR , MHR and UC  with the M•wrap and the Philips Avalon FM 20 , FM30 , FM40, or FM50 . The below 
image is a representative graphic of the M•wrap and possible locations for the TOCO and Doppler 
Transducers.   
 
These TOCO and Doppler  transducers will be placed in the available garment material and will not affect 
the integrity of the electrodes  and wires .  The M•wrap contains spaces  consisting of textile fabric only 
which is  around the inlay section in which CTG transducers can be located without interfering with the 
device. The figure below  shows possible placements for the CTG transducers, labeled A – F. There are six 
broad positions within the garment that can accommodate CTG placement, with some flexibility in  each 
area that will allow for placement optimization.

Arm 2:  Placebo, pre filled syringe, administered Day [ADDRESS_679718] 
chemotherapy cycle.  F-627, 20 mg fixed dose pre filled syringe 
administered Day 2 of each of following 3  chemotherapy cycles.  
Sample Size:  The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the efficacy of F -
627 given as a single fixed dose (20 mg) pre- filled syringe in the first 
chemotherapy cycle as compared to Placebo. The primary end point will 
be the duration of severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L) observed in 
chemotherapy cycle 1.  
Assuming an expected difference in the duration of severe neutropenia 
for F -[ADDRESS_679719] 
deviation of 3 days, this Phase III global clinical study will randomize approximately 120 subjects in a 2:1 ratio to Arm 1 ( F-627 in all 
chemotherapy cycles) and Arm 2 ( Placebo  in Cycle 1 , and F-627 in the 
following 3 chemotherapy cycles) respectively. The dropout rate for the trial is assumed to be 10%. Under these assumptions, enrollment of 80 
subjects for the F -627 arm and 40 subjects for the Placebo arm for Cycle 
1 would be required to realize 90% power.

containing 20.0 mg F-627 as a sterile, single use, preservative free solution for 
convenient subcutaneous injection. 
2.1.2 Physical and Chemical Characteristics of the Drug Substance  
F-627 is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of human G-CSF and human IgG2 
Fc fragments. F-627 is glycosylated with a molecule weight of approximately 93.4 
kDa and is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and is produced via a 
cell culture process in a serum free medium (containing no animal products ) 
followed by a series of purification steps. F-627 is manufactured according to Good Manufacturing P ractice (GMP) for P harmaceutical Products, 1998. The test 
procedure and acceptance criteria followed ICH Guideline, Q6B, 1999. 
  
2.2 Studies and Findings  
2.2.1 Non-Clinical Studies  
F-627 exhibits pharmacological effects in a dose-dependent manner in vitro  and in 
vivo.  Similar to the existing recombinant human granulocyte CSFs (rhG- CSFs), F-
627 was able to stimulate neutrophil production in normal and neutropenic ani mals. 
For cyclophospha mide (CP) -induced neutropenia in monkeys, F- 627 generated faster 
neutrophil recovery and reduced the severity of neutropenia when compared to 
Filgrastim and Pegfilgrastim (1).  
 
F-627 exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. A correlation of 
pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic ( PD) responses was demonstrated in rats and 
monkeys(1). 
 
Preclinical safety studies were conducted including safety pharmacology studies, single dose acute toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, repeat dos ing [ADDRESS_679728] Levels ( NOAELs ) were determined to 
be 1,000 µg/kg in rats and 675 µg/kg in monkeys.

 The duration in days of grade 2 (mild, ANC < 1.5 × 109/L) and 3 (moderate, ANC < 
1.0 × 109/L) neutropenia () for each chemotherapy cycle and over all cycles.  
 The incidence rates of febrile neutropenia ( defined as a single oral temperature of 
≥38.3°C (101°F) or a temperature of >38.0°C (100.4°F) sustained for >1 hour  and ANC < 0.5 
× 109/L) for each chemotherapy cycle.  
 The incidence rates of grade 2, grade 3, and grade 4 neutropenia for all chemotherapy 
cycles . 
 The time in days to ANC recovery post nadir for each chemotherapy cycle and over 
all cycles ; recovery is defined  as an ANC ≥  2.0 × 109/L after the expected ANC nadir.  
 The depth of the ANC nadir for each chemotherapy cycle and over all cycles.   
 The incidence rates of infections for each chemotherapy cycle and over all cycles.  
 The use of antibiotic and pain medications for each chemotherapy cycle and over all 
cycles.  
 ECG endpoints: Change- from -baseline heart rate, PR, QRS and QTcF intervals.

doxorubicin, 75 and 60 mg/m2, respectively).  The 120 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1  
ratio of F -627 and Placebo, respectively. The dropout rate for the trial is assumed to be 
10%. Under these assumptions, enrollment of 80 subjects for the F-627 arm and 40 
subjects for the Placebo arm for Cycle 1 would be required to realize 90% power. 
The patient population in this study is similar to the studies conduc ted by  [CONTACT_80952]  (3),(4).  
Subjects in this study will be those who are scheduled to undergo at least 4, 21-day cycles 
TA (docetaxel  and doxorubicin 75 and 60 mg/m2) chemotherapy . The recommended 
steroid use the day before, the day of and the day after chemotherapy is dexamethasone at a dose level of no more than [ADDRESS_679733]’s first 4 cycles.   
Since all subjects will receive F -627 from cycle two, chemotherapy  dose reduction at cycle 
two should be carefully evaluated. The design is similar to the Phase III trial conducted with Neulasta® (Neulastim®, pegfilgrastim) 
(5-7). 
The screening period for this trial is approximately [ADDRESS_679734] will be consented and then evaluated for study eligibility via the study screening tests. 
Qualified subjects will be randomized to one of two arms in a 2:1 ratio (F -627:Placebo in 
Cycle 1) using a central randomization system (IWRS)  on Day [ADDRESS_679735] 12- lead ECG measurements will be performed  
at baseline, prior to study drug dosing and at th e end of study.  The ECGs will be centrally 
read by a blinded team of readers.  
Approximately 24 hours after chemotherapy administration in each cycle (Day 2 of each 
cycle) , subjects will be administered study drug according to their randomization arm: 
Arm 1: F-627, 20 mg fixed dose pre filled syringe administered Day 2 of each of 4 
chemotherapy cycles.  
Arm 2:  Placebo, fixed dose pre filled syringe administered Day [ADDRESS_679736] chemotherapy 
cycle, and F-627, 20 mg fixed dose pre filled syringe administered Day 2 of each of the following 3 chemotherapy cycles. 
To begin full-dose chemotherapy on Day 1 of the next cycle (day 22 of the previous cycle), it is recommended that patients have a base hemoglobin of at least 11.5 g/dl, WBC  more 
than 4 x 10
9/L and platelet count more than 100 x 109/L.   
Clinical assessments will occur for all subjects during the screening period (Day -15 to Day - 1). Clinical assessments are Cycle specific upon study entry:

4.2 Rationale 
Recombinant human G- CSF (rhG -CSF) was developed and used to treat neutropenia, 
particularly  for the management of neutropenia in patients with cancer  (8),(9). The first 
generation rhG -CSF, f ilgrastim, received FDA approval in the US in 1991 for treat ing 
neutropenia (10-12). The rhG- CSF produced in mammalian cells, lenograstim,  is a 
glycosylated form  that received approval in Europe in [ADDRESS_679739] a half -life of approximately 3 hours and require daily 
administration.  
 A new generation of rhG- CSF is a pegylated rmetHuG -CSF, pegfilgrastim, which received 
FDA approval in 2002 
(13).  Pegfilgrastim has an extended half-life of 30 to 80 hours and 
requires less frequent administration than  filgrastim and lenograstim (14-16).  However, the 
addition of PEG appeared to reduce the affinity for receptor binding compared to parent 
rhG-CSF protein. The b ioactivity of p egfilgrastim is reduced when  compared to f ilgrastim. 
Filgrastim is dosed daily at 300 µg , while a higher dose, 6 mg , of p egfilgrastim is required  
to achieve comparable clinical efficacy.  
  
Reducing the duration and severity of neutropenia following chemotherapy remain s a 
challenge for cancer treatment  (17).  The sponsor is investigating the efficacy of F- 627, a 
dimeric rhG -CSF that is a stronger G- CSFR activator in treating neutropenia.  F-627 may 
bring additional benefits to cancer patients by [CONTACT_523884] -induced neutropenia. Thus, F-627 could be used to better 
manage severe neutropenia, which would fulfill an unmet medical need.

See Section 18.1 and 18.2 (Study Flow Chart). 
  
6.[ADDRESS_679747] cycle of chemotherapy.  Eligible 
subjects in this study will be randomized to either F -627 20 mg/dose or Placebo in a 
2:1 ratio, respectively in Cycle 1 .  Treatment randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_64206] y/region . All subjects will be placed on the F -627 study drug for the following 
3 chemotherapy cycles.  An interactive web -based response system (IWRS) with a 
24-hour live support Helpdesk will be used in the study. Authorized study site personnel will access the randomization system using a user ID and password. Prior training and a user’s manual  will be provided to all the study participating sites.  
 
6.1.2 Simultaneous Utilization of All Arms  
All arms will be utilized concurrently.  
6.2 Trial Treatment and Dosage and Regimen of Investigational Products  
6.2.1 Treatment Dose  
Subjects will be dosed subcutaneously  24 hours after receiving TA chemotherapy.  
Subjects will be dosed with either the F-627 20mg/dose fixed dose pre filled syringe 
or placebo  in the first chemotherapy cycle, depending on the randomization arm 
assigned . All subjects will receive the F-627 20mg/dose fixed dose pre filled syringe 
for chemotherapy cycles [ADDRESS_679748]’s chemotherapy dosing regimen should 
remain unchanged for the first two chemotherapy cycles.  
 
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_679749]  
Each site will receive enough F-627 drug kits and enough placebo kits for their 
subjects for the duration of the clinical trial.  Each F -627 kit will contain one 
prefilled syringe (PFS) containing 20.[ADDRESS_679750] should remain at a temperature between 2 -8
oC.  Any temperature excursions from this 
storage condition should be recorded for time and duration and the study coordinator notified .

6.2.3 Investigational Dose Schedule  
Dosing of study drug will commence on the second day of each chemotherapy cycle (up to 4 cycles) the subject enters.  The dosing should occur at approximately [ADDRESS_679752] participation once randomization has occurred is 
approximately 12 weeks , depending on the chemotherapy schedule deemed appropriate by 
[CONTACT_093] . To begin full -dose chemotherapy on day 1 of the next cycle (day 22 of the 
previous cycle), it is recommended that patient s have a base hemoglobin of at least 11.5 
g/dl, WBC of  more than 4 x 109/L and platelet count more than 100 x 109/L.   
 
6.4 Hold and Stop Rules 
6.4.1 Stop Rules for Subjects (Study Drug Discontinuation)   
Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], serious uncontrolled infection requiring antibiotics, possibly drug 
related SAE , or demonstrated drug hypersensitivity is cause for subjects to discontinue 
drug if the investigator feels it is appropriate.  In addition, the subject’s chemotherapy regimen may be discontinued at the Investigator’s discretion and thus there would be no additional study drug administration.

therapy includes a short acting GCSF.  Any use of concomitant medication should be 
documented and the subject’s ANC level should be closely monitored until recovered. 
 
6.4.2  End of Treatment and Follow -up Visits  
All subjects will receive an end o f study assessment on Day 8 4 (or 3 weeks after the 
patient’s last dose of investigational agent) .  All adverse events will be followed  until 
stabilization or resolution.  Note: these dates are approximate as they are dependent 
upon an individual’s chemother apy treatment schedule.

6.6 Accountability Procedures 
Study medication will be shipped to each institution at the time of site initiation. The 
IWRS will be used to monitor the inventory level of investigational drug supply at clinical sites. The Investigator is also responsible for monitoring the inventory of  medication 
supplies , to ensure sufficient supply for the site . The study monitors will also verify the 
drug accountability during each site monitoring visit. At the end of the study, all study drug supplies will be returned to the Sponsor/designee by [CONTACT_205301] , 
or destroyed on- site per local documented procedures  or requirements.

For all adverse events, the Investigator must obtain adequate information to determine the cause and outcome of the adverse event, and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to  Generon and its designated representative (see Section 9.5.9). The 
Investigator is required to assess the causality and indicate that assessment on the eCRF. Follow -up of the adverse event, after the date of therapy discontinuation, is 
required until the adverse event or subsequent resulting AEs attributed to an ongoing AE resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the Investigator and the Generon clinician and safety officer.

Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 34 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 9.5.2 Definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any occurrence or worsening of an unde sirable or 
unintended sign, symptom (including an abnormal laboratory finding), or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Worsening of underlying disease will not be considered to be an adverse event, since it will be class ified as a treatment 
failure. Pregnancy will not be considered to be an adverse event, but will be collected separately. However if the resultant child has a birth defect, this will be considered to be an SAE.  
 
Throughout the study, the Investigator must record all adverse events on the eCRF adverse event pages, regardless of the severity or relationship to study 
medication or procedure. The Investigator should treat subjects with adverse events appropr iately and observe them at suitable intervals until the events resolve 
or stabilize.  
 
Adverse events can be discovered by [CONTACT_523889], questioning the 
patient objectively and/or receiving an unsolicited complaint from the patient.  
 
A subject’s AE ’s will be collected from the start of the study medication until the 
subject’s last study visit. AE’s that  are unresolved at the time of study termination 
will be followed until they resolve or stabilize.  
 
9.5.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events (SA E) are defined as any adverse events occurring at any 
dose that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 
This includes, but may not be limited to any of the following events: 
 
Death: A death occurring during the study , or which comes to the attention of 
the Investigator during the protocol -defined follow -up after the completion of 
therapy, must be reported whether or not considered treatment- related . 
 
Life-threatening: Any adverse therapy experience that places the subject, in 
the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred . 
 
1. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
 
2. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
 
3. Congenital anomaly/birth defect.

SAEs will be collected from the time of randomization until [ADDRESS_679771] be reported as a serious 
adverse event regardless of its presumed relation to the study drug. 
 
9.5.4 Grading Adverse Events  
Toxicity grades are assigned by [CONTACT_523890]. To do this, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.[ADDRESS_679772] language to describe toxicities, to facilitate tabulation and analysis of the data, and to facilitate the assessment of the clinical significance of all adverse  events. Adverse events should be recorded and 
graded 1 to 5 according to the CTCAE grades provided below: 
 
 Grade 1 = Mild adverse event  
 Grade 2 = Moderate adverse event  
 Grade 3 = Severe and undesirable adverse event  
 Grade 4 = Life -threatening or disabling adverse event  
 Grade 5 = Death

Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 9.5.5 Exposure i n Utero  
For investigational products within clinical trials and for marketed products, an 
exposure  in-utero  (EIU) occurs if a female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant 
either while receiving or having been exposed to (e.g., environmental) an investigational medication or product, or if the female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational medication or product. 
If any trial subject becomes or is fo und to be pregnant while receiving an 
investigational medication/product, the Investigator must submit this information 
to the Generon Safety Officer or sponsor designee using the Exposure I n Utero  
(EIU) eCRF within [ADDRESS_679773] be done irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to induced termination of pregnancy).  
The Investigator will follow the su bject until completion of the pregnancy or until 
pregnancy termination (i.e., induced abortion) and then notify the Generon 
Medical Officer or sponsor’s designee of the outcome. The Investigator will provide this information as a follow up to the initial E xposure in Utero  Form. The 
reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified. An EIU report is not created when an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy is not usually viable. Rather, an SAE case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as 
a serious adverse event (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, including that found in an aborted fetus, stillbirth or n eonatal 
death), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.  
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth (i.e., no minimum follow -up period of a presumably normal i nfant is 
required before an Exposure  In Utero  Form can be completed). The “normality” 
of an aborted fetus can be assessed by [CONTACT_4692], unless pre -abortion 
test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly. 
Additional information about pre gnancy outcomes that are classified as serious 
adverse events follows:  
•    “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
•     All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_679774] to causality, as serious adverse events. In addition, any infant 
death after 1  month that the Investigator assesses as possibly related to the in 
utero  exposure to the investigational medication should be reported.

The question asked will be “Since your last clinic visit have you had any health problems?”, or a similar question.  
 
9.5.9 Reporting Requirements (Serious and Non-S erious)  
Each adverse event is to be classified by [CONTACT_162834] -
serious. This classification determines  the reporting procedures to be followed. If 
a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations.  
 SAEs are reportable from the time that the subject is randomized in the clinical trial up to and including [ADDRESS_679778] be promptly reported if a causal relationship to study drug is suspected.   If a serious adverse event occurs, the Generon Safety Officer and/or his/her agent 
are to be notified within  [ADDRESS_679779] 
be made to the Generon Safety Officer or his/her agent immediately, irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information. This time frame also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously forwarded serious 
adverse event reports.  
 In the rare event that the Investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious adverse event immediately (e.g., if an outpatient trial subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator is to report the event within 24  hours 
after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse 
event.  
 For all serious adverse events, the Investigator is obligated to provide information to the Generon Safety Officer and his/her agent in accordance with the time frame s for reporting specified above. In addition, the Generon study clinician or 
the Generon Safety Officer may request an Investigator to obtain specific follow- up information in an expedited fashion. This information may be more 
detailed than that captured on the adverse event electronic case report form. This will include a description of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other poss ible causes of the event, such as

Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 40 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.[ADDRESS_679780] be submitted as soon as possible to the Generon Safety Officer and his/her designated re presentative.  
 The Investigator’s causality assessment must be included in all reports of serious adverse events. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product  
caused or contributed to an adverse event. If the Investigator’s final determination is that causality is unknown and the Investigator cannot determine whether the event is related to study drug, then the event will be handled as “related to study drug” for reporting purposes. If the Investigator's causality assessment is 
"unknown but not related to study drug", this should be clearly documented on study records. In addition, if the Investigator determines the adverse event is associated with trial procedu res, the Investigator must record this causal 
relationship in the source documents and eCRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse event reporting requirements.   
 All adverse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the eCRF. It should be noted that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the adverse event eCRF. Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same adverse event term should be used on both forms / eCRFs. Adverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology as defined in the CTCAE short names on the eCRFs as well as on the form for collection of serious adverse event inform ation. 
 Non-serious adverse events are to be reported on the adverse event page of the 
eCRFs, which are to be submitted to Generon as specified in the adverse event report submission procedure for this protocol.   If a subject begins a new therapy, the adverse event -reporting period will end at 
the time that the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs within [ADDRESS_679781], irrespective of any intervening treatment.

* CBC is d ependent on individual subject’s ANC levels; tests to occur (every other day) until 
subject’s ANC  ≥ 2.0 × 109/L post- nadir  is attained  and then three day s later .   If the ANC level of 
a subject is < 0.5 × 109/L for two consecutive visits, the subject must return the following day 
and then daily for an ANC blood draw until the ANC level is > 0.5 × 109/L.

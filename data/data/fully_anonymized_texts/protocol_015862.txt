06/02/[ADDRESS_1084232] s with clinical stage I, II 
or III estrogen- receptor  (ER)-positive breast cancer . This combination of vaccine with chemotherapy 
will be called “ Chemovax ”. P10s -PADRE will be administered with MONTANIDE™  ISA [ADDRESS_1084233] cancers that express Tumor -Associated Carbohydrate Antigens (TACAs) can 
be immunogenic, and enhancing the anti -TACA antibodies and immune effector function already 
present may augment the cytotoxic effects of SoC therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 
A single -arm trial is designed with the goal being to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of  combining 
vaccination of the P10s -PADRE formulation with  neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Feasibility will be based 
on the safety, tolerability, and immune- response adequacy of P10 s-PADRE when it is administered in 
combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Once a feasible schedule of Chemovax has been 
identified, efficacy will be based on the rate of pathologic Complete Response (pCR) observed among 
ER-positive breast -cancer subjec ts treated with the combination.  
 The feasibility of schedule and clinical response to the vaccine will be assessed as follows:  
 
Primary Objective s: 
1) Identify a feasible schedule of vaccination relative to SoC  neoadjuvant chemotherapy when 
the two are administered concurrently . Feasibility will be evaluated in terms of : 
a) Generation of a sufficiently high anti -P10s immunoglobulin- G response  
b) Safety and tolerability  of the combination of vaccine and chemotherapy  
 2) Demonstration of c linical response:  
Determine if the Chemovax  regimen in ER-positive breast cancer would lead to a significantly 
higher  rate of pCR in breast and axillary lymph nodes at time of definitive surgery compared to the 
corresponding rate reported by  [CONTACT_703411]  (1, 2) . 
 
Secondary Objectives:  
1) Determine Short- term Immune Responses Induced by  [CONTACT_787873] : 
a) Determine the functional humoral response as defined by:  
i. P10s -MAP -reactive immunoglobulin- G endpoint titers in serum.  
ii. Cytotoxicity  of serum and plasma samples against two TACA -expressing breast cancer 
cell lines following Chemovax therapy.  
b) Determine the activation profile of NK cells before and after Chemovax therapy.  
c) Determine T -cell subpopulations and evaluate the effects of Chemovax therapy on the 
numbers of circulating T cells.  
d) Perform functional T -cell immune analysis by [CONTACT_746] T -cell proliferation, ELISPOT, 
cytokine release and ADCC assays.  
e) Determine expression of biomarkers of efficacy and response on tumor tissues and 
characterize tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and their role in response to therapy.  
 
2) Determine Long -term Immune Res ponses Induced by [CONTACT_787873]:  
a) Determine antibody titers against P10s at approximately 6 and 12 months following the initial response evaluation.  
b) Measure anti -TACA cell- binding levels at approximately 6 and 12 months following the initial 
response evaluation.  
c) Determine the cytotoxic activity against TACA -expressing cell lines at approximately 6 and 12 
months following the initial response evaluation.  
d) Evaluate the functionality of T and NK cells.

Study Design : This combined Phase I/II feasibility -and-efficacy study will have three parts . Its first 
part will be a Phase I evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of eliciting adequate IgG 
response with P10s -PADRE when  administered in combination with SoC neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 
and will require [ADDRESS_1084236] 
parts . The study’s  second and third parts  will respectively  constitute  Stages 1 and 2 of  the Phase II 
primary -efficacy evaluation of Chemovax  using a Simon optimal  two-stage design, and  will require a 
minimum of 19 subjects (5 subjects from Part 1 + an additional 14 subjects) and a maximum of  41 
subjects  (19 subjects from Part 1 & 2 + an additional 22 subjects) . The total sample size in the entire 
study will have a theoretical minimum of  [ADDRESS_1084237] this study, eligible subjects of all races, aged 18 years or older, will be enrolled and 
immunized by [CONTACT_787874] P10s -PADRE vaccine on each of 3 separate occasions over a 
three- week period at a dose level of 500 micrograms ( μg) per immunization. Blood will be collected 
from each subject  once before and [ADDRESS_1084238] biopsy and/or surgery. These samples will be used for histology and immune cell isolation to identify immune cell infiltrates. Safety and tolerability of Chemovax will be 
evaluated throughout all parts/phases of the study . The primary efficacy endpoint  is pCR and will be 
used to determine if Chemovax  treatment in ER-positive breast cancer subject s will improve  pCR at 
time of the definitive surgery to a rate significantly higher  than the corresponding rate reported by  [CONTACT_787875]. (1).

Version 21 
06/02/[ADDRESS_1084239] of carbohydrate- targeted vaccines: The potential impact of 
vaccines that induce responses to tumor -associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) is demonstrated 
by [CONTACT_787876] e-reactive IgM levels 
(3). Such results suggest that TACA -targeting vaccines might have a beneficial effect on the course 
of malignant disease.  Vaccine -induced anti -TACA antibodies can trigger cancer cell death and 
augmentation of cellular immune response through cross presentation of tumor antigens, leading to 
shrinkage of metastatic lesions and further improving survival.  TACA -induced responses  could 
augment naturally occurring carbohydrate- reactive IgM antibodies that trigger apoptosis of tumor cells 
(4). TACAs are attractive targets because the majority of cell -surface proteins and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_787859], and the glycosyl moiety is fundamental to the biological functions of these molecules in 
cancer cells (5, 6) . A unique advantage in targeting TACAs is that multiple proteins and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_787860]. Thus, targeting the carbohydrate antigen broadens the spectrum of antigens recognized by [CONTACT_428631], thereby [CONTACT_703414][INVESTIGATOR_787861] (7). In addition, antibodies that 
recognize glycolipi[INVESTIGATOR_787862] -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and may, 
therefore, be more cytotoxic to tumor cells than antibodies that recognize protein antigens (8) . 
 Approaches to augment immune responses to TACA:  A variety of approaches are being taken to 
generate responses to TACAs. Because TACAs are T -cell-independent antigens and self-antigens, 
conjugation to immunologic carrier proteins is perceived to be essential to recruit T -cell help in antibody 
generation. Conjugation does not, however, assure an increase in immunogenicity because 
conjugation strategies do not uniformly enha nce carbohydrate immunogenicity (9,  10). Furthermore, 
even with conjugation, the lack of induction of cellular immune responses that would amplify TACA -
reactive humoral responses necessitates constant boosting with vaccine. Representative examples of 
carbohydrate- based conjugate vaccines in clinical development include those directed toward 
gangliosides (11- 14), polysialic acid (8) , Globo -H (15), LeY (16) , and the sialosyl -TN (STn) antigen 
(17). 
 
An approach predicted to facilitate cellular responses exploits the molecular mimicry of TACAs by 
[CONTACT_787877], as they are T -cell-dependent antigens. Clinical characterizations of anti -idiotypic 
antibodies that mimic the GD3 ganglioside antigen (18) and GD2 (19) have been described. 
Carbohydrate mimetic peptides (CMPs) are alternatives to anti -idiotypic antibodies. The 
characterization of CMPs is at present limited to preclinical studies. CMPs that induce immune 
responses cross- reactive with TACA are also referred to as peptide mimotop es. Peptide mimotopes 
have been described for GD2 (20 -22), GD3 (23) , sialylated Lewis a/x (24)  and Lewis Y (LeY) antigens 
(22, 25) . Importantly, in preclinical prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination studies, peptide 
mimotopes were efficacious in eliciting immune responses that reduced tumor burden and inhibited 
metastatic outgrowth (25 -27). Thus, peptide mimotopes of TACAs represent a new and very promising 
tool to overcome T -cell independence and to increase the efficiency of the immune response to glycan 
antigens.  
 
Benefits of peptide mimotope immunization:  There are several benefits to vaccination strategies 
that employ peptide mimotopes of TACA. First, peptide mimotopes f unction as xenoantigens and, 
consequently, provide an advantage to overcome tolerance to carbohydrate self -antigens. Antibodies 
induced by [CONTACT_703416]; specific targeting of tumor 
cells is due in part to ov er-expression of the carbohydrate antigen on tumor cells, which compensates 
for the low affinity of the carbohydrate cross -reactive antibodies (28) . In addition, mimotope- induced 
antibodies preferentially recognize the terminal residues of the TACA oligosaccharides, which are often structurally dis tinct from those found on normal cells (29) . Thus , potential immunopathology due 
to destruction of normal tissue is minimized (30, 31) .

Sponsor: UAMS  
Version 21 
06/02/[ADDRESS_1084240] the potential to overcome immune deficiencies that suppress 
vaccine -induced carbohydrate- directed responses (32) . Unlike carbohydrate antigens and 
carbohydrate- conjugate vaccines, peptide mimotopes also prime B - and T -cells for subsequent 
memory of carbohydrate antigens, facilitating long- term surveillance through recall of carbohydrate 
immune responses (7). This effect may minimize the need for constant boosting. In addition, they can 
functionally emulate conserved structures of TACA, inducing antibodies that recognize multiple TACA, 
and therefore functioning like a TACA multivalent vac cine.  
 
Third, peptide mimotopes can be manipulated in ways that TACA cannot. Peptide mimotopes can be 
engineered to induce CD8+ T cells cross -reactive with tumor -associated glycopeptides and/or to 
induce CD4+ T cells that benefit the further expansion of C D8+ T cells and B -cells (7, 27) . The ability 
to induce a humoral carbohydrate cross -reactive response, a CD4+ T  helper response, and a CD8+ 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response with one simple inoculation is a novel approach to vaccination. 
Therefore, peptide mimotopes hold the potential to generate a multifaceted TACA -reactive immune 
response.  
 
Target carbohydrat e antigens expressed on breast cancer cells:  Tumors expressing high levels 
of certain types of TACAs exhibit greater metastasis than those expressing low levels of these 
antigens, and this negatively impacts prognosis (33 -35). In breast cancer, the LeY, STn, and KH -1 
antigens, as well as selected gangliosides, glycosphingolipi[INVESTIGATOR_703394]- H carbohydrate antigens, 
are considered prime vaccine candidates because of their tissue distribution (36, 37) . In particular, 
LeY has long been recognized as a potential target for immunotherapy because it is expressed in 70–
90% of tumors of epi[INVESTIGATOR_412261] (38) . The abundant gangliosides include GM3, GM2, GM1, and GD2, 
GD3 and GT3 (39) . Antibodies to TACAs mediate a variety of effector functions and might lend to 
cross- present ation of tumor antigens to stimulate anti -tumor cellular responses. At present, LeY -
conjugate vaccines appear to have only a limited ability to induce anti -LeY immune responses in 
humans . Our in vitro  studies demonstrate that peptide mimotopes of LeY and gangliosides induce 
serum antibodies in mice that recognize the appropriate carbohydrate antigens on human or murine 
breast cancer cell lines. Our in vivo  studies demonstrate that the peptide mimotopes induce sustained 
immunity to these antigens. Collectively, these data provide the experimental foundation for evaluating peptide mimotopes as potential cancer vaccines in subjects with breast cancer.  
 
Role of Natural Killer (NK) cells in P10s mediated anti -tumor activity : In preclinical studies we 
observed a role for NK cells in tumor -growth inhibition upon immunization with the P10s -PADRE 
vaccine. NK cells are known to have potent anti -tumor activity and thus play an important role in 
metastasis clearance. In light of the finding of increased NK activation in similar preclinical setting by 
[CONTACT_517753]. (40), we hypothesize that the anti -tumor effect observed in mice immuniz ed with 
P10s could be due to interactions between NK cells and the anti -tumor B cell response that has been 
boosted by [CONTACT_703417] (40) . Human subjects immunized with P10s -PADRE in the Phase I safety 
study of P10s -PADRE displayed elevated activation of their NK cells . This finding provides an 
expectation of benefit upon immunization with P10s -PADRE . 
 
Role of B and T cells : Chemotherapy is assumed to be i mmunosuppressive. However,  each drug 
might have differ ing affects  when used in combination with specific immunotherapy. Thus, diverse 
effects may have been achieved depending on the time and the dose of administration. For example, 
high dose doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (CY) , while not beneficial for T -cell response,  have been 
noted to enhance the immunogen- specific antibody- forming cells  (41). Early reports indicated that low 
dose CY treatment might  facilitate adaptive T cell immunity by [CONTACT_684435] “suppressor” T cells . In 
addition to its role on T lymphocytes, CY has been shown to switch cytokine production of tumor -
infiltrating -macrophages from IL- 10 to IFN -γ (42) and polarize Th1/Th2 responses (43) . Our own 
studies indicate that immunization with a CMP followed by [CONTACT_787878] (44), including P10s -PADRE (data unpublished) . The administ ration of docetaxel to 
patients with metastatic prostate or breast cancer, as well as that of cisplatin plus vinorelbine to non-

 small cell lung cancer patients, appears to significantly increase the ratio between effector T cells and 
regulatory T cells ( Tregs) and to reduce the immunosuppressive activity of the latter in the majority of 
patients (45). Such studies provide the rationale for the selective use of acti ve immunotherapy 
regimens in combination with specific SoC  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_787863].  Developi[INVESTIGATOR_787864] . Recently introduced immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
such as anti -PD-[ADDRESS_1084241]  of immune checkpoint -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (46-48). 
 Potential for benefit with combination therapy:  Mechanisms by [CONTACT_787879] -induced humoral immunity and vice versa remain largely unknown. It  is possible that 
antibodies can sensitize tumor cells for more efficient killing by [CONTACT_321874]. In a Phase I trial with the P10s -PADRE vaccine, we observed that antibodies induced by P10s are cytotoxic to human 
breast cancer cell lines including a Trastuzumab- resistant one (49). TACA expression is part of 
signaling pathways that confer death resistance. Cells resistant to death are those that cause 
treatment failure and can colonize distant organs and vice versa. Admixing serum from P10s -PADRE 
immunized subject with docetaxel was shown to lower the LC
50 value for the drug in killing a human 
tumor cell line. Consequently , immuniza tion with P10s -PADRE follo wed by [CONTACT_787880].  
 
Summary of results from the Phase I trial with P10s -PADRE: A Phase I dose- escalation trial was 
designed to determine a maximum tolerated dose of vaccine plus adjuvant in two cohorts of stage IV breast cancer subject s. The study design was the rule- based “traditional” 3+3 design ( 50), with [ADDRESS_1084242] (IRB) and was completed . 
 
Female subjects [ADDRESS_1084243] cancer were eligible, and subjects were enrolled after providing written, informed 
consent. The following eligibility criteria were used:  The cancer must have been newly diagnosed 
metastatic or relapsed after primary or adjunctive therapy and must not have required a treatment 
change for [ADDRESS_1084244] supportive care medications. 
Disease staging was done according to the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC), sixth edition; no expectation of response to other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status of 0–1; no prior therapy within 4 weeks and adequate organ function (white blood 
cell count ≥3,000/ mm
3, hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL, platelets ≥100,000/mm3 within 2 weeks prior to 
registration, total bilirubin ≤3.0 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase ≤200 IU/L, alani ne 
aminotransferase ≤200 IU/L, and serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL). Subjects had to be immunocompetent 
as measured by [CONTACT_703421]. The following exclusion criteria 
were applied: massive ascites; known brain metastasis ; pregnancy or lactation; known history of HIV 
infection; clinically serious infection; severe cardiac insufficiency; other active malignancy; history of 
organ allograft; immunodeficiency or history of splenectomy; concurrent treatment with steroids or 
immunosuppressive agents; and unsuitability for the trial , based on clinical judgment.  
 The peptide vaccine was administered in liquid form, emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant 
(IFA; Montanide ISA  51 VG SEPPIC ), by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injections on [ADDRESS_1084245] cohort began with a 300 μg dose, and then the subsequent cohort 
received a 500 μg dose of P10s -PADRE. The peptides and IFA were synthesized according to Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines. The primary endpoint was the safety of P10s -PADRE 
vaccination. The secondary endpoints were immunologic responses, clinical outcomes, and determination of the optimal dose of peptide for further clinical trials. The trial is registered on NIH’s 
ClinicalTrial.gov results database (number [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).

 Subjects were evaluated for signs of toxicity during and after vaccination. Adverse events (AEs) were 
graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0. Toxicities assessed were the laboratory parameters listed in the study 
calendar, as well as any sign or symptom found during the history and physical examination not noted 
at pre- study or on the baseline evaluation. Special attent ion was paid to signs and symptoms related 
to injection reactions, injection site reactions or symptoms or laboratory findings indicating  
autoimmune toxicities.  
 
Sixteen subjects were consented,  but only  [ADDRESS_1084246] cancer cell lines , including a Trastuzumab-
resistant one,  which established an expectation of therapeutic benefit (expectation of efficacy). In 
summary, P1 0s vaccination was well -tolerated with injection site irritation as the only repetitive AE , 
and measurable immune responses and anti -cancer -cell efficacy were noted. This is the first study to 
show that CMP vaccination is safe and can induce functional ant ibodies that might have therapeutic 
benefit in subject s immunized with P10s.  
 
Neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer:  The treatment of breast cancer  includes the treatment of 
local disease  with surgery, radiation therapy, or both, and the treatment of systematic disease with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, biologic therapy  (such as T rastuzumab in HER2  positive 
disease), or combination of these. The need for and selection of various local or systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_787865], clinical and 
pathologic characteristics of the primary tumor, axillary lymph node status, tumor hormone receptor 
content, tumor HER2 status, multi -gene testing, presence or absence of detectable metastati c 
disease, patient comorbidities, patient age, and menopausal status.  
 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become commonly used based on results from randomized trials 
suggesting no difference in relapse- free or overall survival whether chemotherapy is administer ed 
before or after surgery (51). A major benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the increase in the rate 
of breast conserving surgery. Tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has proven to be a good surrogate end- point for survival; the achievement of pCR is strongly associated with a favorable long-
term survival rates (75% to 85% at 10 to 15 y ears) (51-55). Thus, improving pCR has become a valid 
strategy in the development o f new treatment regimen s. Specifically,  the rate of pCR achieved in ER -
positive breast -cancer sub jects following  vaccination with P10s -PADRE administered concurrently 
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be compared with the corresponding pCR rate from a pooled 
analysis of seven randomized trials published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (1) in whic h [ADDRESS_1084247] -cancer subjects (approximately 8%) achieved the “ypT0 ypN0”  definition of 
pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy . 
 
Definition of Pathological Complete Response:  Pathological Complete Response will be defined  
as “the absence of any residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected 
breast specimen and all sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy  (i.e., ypT0 /Tis ypN0 in the current AJCC staging system ).” (56) 
 Rationale for using P10s- PADRE in the neoadjuvant setting : The traditional drug development 
process based on large phase III trials to show statistical incremental benefit from SoC  therapy is slow, 
expensive, and inefficient. In contrast, the neoadjuvant trial model provides rapid assessment of short -
term drug eff icacy and triage utilizing pCR as the primary endpoint.  Thus, improving pCR has become 
a valid strategy in the development of new treatment regimens.

06/02/[ADDRESS_1084248] exemplified in the development of HER2- directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as 
lapatinib (NeoALTTO trial)  (57), and pertuzumab (NeoSphere trial) 58) . Recognizing the importance 
of neoadjuvant trials for drug development, the FDA recently announced the consideration of 
neoadjuvant rando mized trials for accelerated drug approval in early breast cancer (59). In line with 
this approach,  in September [ADDRESS_1084249] 
that both anti -peptide IgM and IgG titers rose sharply by  [CONTACT_5875] 7 (four weeks after the third 
immunization) of the study  (when additional boost was administered) in most subjects.  IgM titers  were 
short -lived and returned to baseli ne by [CONTACT_5875] 19, whereas  IgG titers remained elevated through at least  
week 21. Based on the above data, we expect that three doses of the vaccine will be sufficient to 
achieve a significant immune response, but no previous data are available on the immunogenicity of 
the investigational agent when administered concurrently with chemotherapy  and steroids (used as 
antiemetics) . Because of the above concerns,  our study will begin by [CONTACT_787881] P10s -PADRE when it is administered in combination with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy . To this end,  we have defined five different Chemovax  schedules, and 
named them  A, B, C, D, and E ( see 8. Chemovax Schedules  for the details of each schedule) . There 
will be five subjects  in each cohort enrolled onto a Chemovax  schedule. Schedules  will be evaluated 
for immune -response adequacy . 
 
Justification for 500ug vaccine dose:  Whereas medications work via distribution through the 
bloodstream, the immune response generated by [CONTACT_787882][INVESTIGATOR_787866]. In the Phase I study we observed an increase in IgG binding to the P10s peptide after 
immunization as measured by [CONTACT_46096]. Anti -P10s  serum reactivity surged dramatically from week 
[ADDRESS_1084250], in whom it was already surging at week 
4. The increases at week 7 compared to pre- immune ranged from 31 fold (in subject #2) to 256 fold 
(in subjects #5 and #6), and the titers in subsequent weeks showed little change from their week -7 
values . The cohort immunized with the higher dose of vaccine ( 500 μg dose) displayed higher 
normalized endpoint titers. In nonparametric repeated- measures analysis, the main effects of dose 
and week were statistically significant ( both P values <.0001), but the dose×week interaction was not 
(P=0.40). While we did not observe dose- limiting toxicity in this study , it is difficult to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose of the vaccine because of the potential of forming granulomas due to the 
nature of the adjuvant. P10s is admixed with MONTANIDE™  ISA 51 VG, an adjuvant known to form 
granulomas.  
 
4. TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
 
Primary Objectives  
1) Identify a feasible schedule of vaccination relative to SoC  neoadjuvant chemotherapy when 
the two are administered concurrently. Feasibility will be evaluated in terms of:  
a) Generation of a sufficiently high anti -P10s immunoglobulin- G response.  
b) Safety and tolerability of the vaccine- chemotherapy combination.  
 
2) Demons tration of clinical response:  
Determine if the Chemovax regimen in ER -positive breast cancer would lead to a significantly 
higher rate of pCR in breast and axillary nodes at time of definitive surgery compared to the pCR rate of 8% observed among 3,[ADDRESS_1084251] s in the pooled analysis of 
seven randomized clinical trials reported by [CONTACT_703411]  (1-2).

a. General Description:  P10s -PADRE  is a short peptide (P10s) coupled to PADRE, a synthetic, 
non-natural peptide that binds with high or intermediate affinity to [ADDRESS_1084257] molecules in the human population. 
Furthermore, the PADRE peptide was specifically engineered as an antigen- presenting molecule 
for use in humans . Carbohydrate moieties, such as TACAs, typi[INVESTIGATOR_703400] T -cell 
responses . Thus, P10s, a TACA peptide mimotope, was developed. By [CONTACT_366438] P10s to PADRE, 
the likelihood of generating an immune response increases, including T-cell "help" in the vaccine 
construct desig ned for human use.  
 MONTANIDE™  ISA 51 VG  STERILE  is defined as an oil adjuvant containing surfactant based 
mannide monooleate and oil, which is of white mineral oil origin.

7. STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a single- arm, multi -site Phase I/II study designed with the two goals being (1) to evaluate the 
feasibility of combining vaccination with the P10s -PADRE formulation with neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
and (2) to determine if the pCR rate among ER -positive breast -cancer subject s treated with the 
combination is significantly higher than the 8% rate observed among ER -positive breast -cancer 
subjects i n a pooled analysis of seven randomized clinical trials (1) . P10s -PADRE vaccine with 
MONTANIDE™  ISA [ADDRESS_1084262] cancer.  
 This combined Phase I/II feasibility -and-efficacy study will have three parts . Its first part will be a Phase 
I evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of eliciting adequate IgG response with P10s -
PADRE when  administered in combination with SoC  neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and will require [ADDRESS_1084263] parts. The study’s second and third parts will respectively constitute Stages 1 and 2 of the Phase II primary -efficacy evaluation 
of Chemovax using a Simon optimal two- stage design, and will require a minimum of 19 subjects (5 
subjects from Part 1 + an additional 14 subjects) and a maximum of 41 subjects  (19 subjects from Part 
1 & 2 + an additional 22 subjects) . The total sample size in the entire study  will have a theoretical 
minimum of [ADDRESS_1084264] Cancer Patients  IRB 202556 & 204187

Version 21 
06/02/[ADDRESS_1084265] defined five different Chemovax schedules, and named 
them A, B, C, D, and E; see Chemovax Schedules  for the details of each schedule. From one to five 
cohorts of subjects will be enrolled sequentially and used to evaluate the s chedules in alphabetical 
order, beginning with Schedule A . There will be five subjects in each cohort enrolled onto a Chemovax 
schedule. A schedule that has a cohort enrolling onto it will be evaluated for immune- response 
adequacy . 
 
The best immune respons e with the leas t toxicity will be the  Chemovax schedule that will be 
expanded and used to initiate the primary efficacy evaluation of Chemovax using a Simon optimal 
two-stage design ( 60, 61).

 Following Part 1 (feasibility), Cohort C and E displayed a significant average fold increase in anti -
peptide titers after immunization. Cohort C had a higher overall average fold increase and a higher 
number of responders. Therefore, Cohort C was identified as the best schedule for Part 2 (primary 
efficacy). Cohort C was expanded with an additional [ADDRESS_1084267] 2 subjects from Cohort C achieving pCR. A total of 4 subjects obtained pCR. Cohort C will be 
expanded for Part 3 (expanded efficacy).  
 
8. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
a. On-study Plan : After signing the IRB -approved informed consent form, research participants with 
eligibility confirmed will be registered and assigned a study number by a clinical research associate 
(CRA) or Study Coordinator . All research participants will receive the Mi motope P10s -
PADRE/ MONTANIDE™  ISA 51 VG vaccine via SC injection as well as SoC  neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy according to the schedule on which they are enrolled (see Schedules below).  
 
b. Chemotherapy:  For all subjects, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) 
(AC) will be administered concurrently every three weeks for four cycles followed by [CONTACT_114501] ( 75 
mg/m2) every three weeks for four cycles , with growth factor at physician’s discretion.  Subjects will 
be monitored for chemotherapy -related toxi cities and, if clinically necessary, chemotherapy dosing 
may be modified  per the Chemotherapy Dose Adjustment  table.  
 
c. Chemotherapy Dose Adjustment:  Any or all of the SoC neoadjuvant chemotherap ies may 
be dose- reduced , as necessary, according to the table below. If docetaxel is not tolerated, 
paclitaxel may be used in its place. Chemotherapy dosing may be re- escalated  to the starting 
dose at the treating physician’s discretion and per SoC . Subjects who require different 
chemotherapy agents the first post -surgery study lab at Week 49 (Schedule C) will be followed 
for [ADDRESS_1084268] vaccination and then be withdrawn from the study.  
 
Chemotherapy  Starting Dose  Reduction 1  Reduction 2  Reduction 3  
Doxorubicin  60 mg/m2 -20% -10% Discontinue  
Cyclophosphamide  600 mg/m2 -20% -10% Discontinue  
Docetaxel  75 mg/m2 -20% -10% Discontinue  
Paclitaxel * 175mg/m2 -20% -10% Discontinue  
* in case of docetaxel substitut ion only 
 SoC neoadjuvant chemotherapy dosing may be delayed up to +7 days due to AEs (e.g. anemia, 
neutropenia, leukopenia, etc.). For d elays longer than 7 days, the Medical Monitor and Sponsor 
should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  Any delay outside the allotted time window  will be a deviation. T he remainder 
of the study visits should be adjusted accordingly with a note- to-file. Each initial shift in the study 
calendar would be a deviation due to medical necessity and the following visits would be 
recalibrated without deviation.  
 
Subjects who require dose modifications, treatment delays, or are unable to resume their SoC 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy  (e.g. due to chemotherapy -related toxicities ) will remain in the study 
to continue with assessments per the study calendar, including collection of study labs.  
 
d. Chemovax Schedules:  
• SCHEDULE A : Subjects will receive the first cycle of chemotherapy along with the first dose 
of vaccine on week 1, the subsequent two doses of vaccine one week apart (week 2 and 3), 
second cycle of chemotherapy on week 4, and subsequent cycles of chemotherapy every 21 
days (week 7,  10, 13, 16, 19, 22).

• SCHEDULE E : Subjects will receive the first dose of vaccine on week 1, the subsequent two 
doses of vaccine one week apart (week 2 and 3), the first cycle of chemotherapy on week 3 
(along with third vaccine dose ) and subsequent cycles of chemotherapy every 21 days (week 
6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24). 
 
e. Prohibi ted Medications:  Immunosuppressant medications are not allowed including inhaled and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] , except for those subjects on chemotherapy as prescribed to reduce chemo 
symptoms by [CONTACT_787884] . All other 
medications are allowed.  
 
Concurrent enrollment in another clinical trial using drugs or devices may be allowed only after the 
first post -surgery study lab at Week 49 (Schedule C).  Concurrent enrollment in observational trials 
is allowed throughout the study.  
 
f. Dose Limiting Criteria:  This dose of investigational agent was well tolerated when used in our 
Phase I study in breast cancer subjects. However, if a subject does not tolerate the vaccine, judged by [CONTACT_787885] -limiting criteria below, their vaccination treatment will be discontinued.  
 
• Any grade 3 or greater toxicity as per NCI CTCAE v4 toxicity criteria  
• Grade 2 or greater autoimmune toxicity, with the exception of vitiligo  
• Grade 2 or greater hypersensitivity reactions  
 
Subjects w ho develop any grade 3 or greater toxicity per NCI CTCAE v 4.0 toxicity criteria, Grade 
2 or greater autoimmune toxicity with the exception of vitiligo, or Grade 2 or greater hypersensitivity reactions will be treated and referred for additional care as ind icated with systemic steroids, topi[INVESTIGATOR_28709], epi[INVESTIGATOR_703403]. These subjects  will no longer receive the vaccine but will 
continue with assessments per the study calendar , including collection of study labs.  
 
g. Study Pausing Rules:  
• Death (other than due to disease progression or motor vehicle accident  or to other events 
determined to be not related to the vaccine)  
• Two Grade 4 toxicity events that are possibly/probably related to the vaccine

13. ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS, EVALUATION of IMMUNE -RESPONSE ENDPOINTS , and 
ENDPOINT -ASSAY METHODS  
 
a. Primary Feasibility Endpoint:  Adequate IgG Response  
This will be defined as a > 4-fold increase in a subject’s anti -P10s -MAP IgG titer at Week 7  or later  
(at least [ADDRESS_1084376] immunization)  relative to her pre- immune titer.  
 
b. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Path ologic Complete Response (pCR)  
We will employ the definition of pCR proposed by [CONTACT_703432] 2012 Draft Guidance for 
Industry, “Pathologic Complete Response in Neoadjuvant Treatment of High- Risk Early -Stage 
Breast Cancer: Use as an En dpoint to Support Accelerated Approval” . The FDA’s proposed 
definition reads as follows:  
 
Pathological Complete Response is defined as the absence of any residual invasive 
cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected breast specimen and all sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy  
(i.e., ypT0 /Tis ypN0 in the current AJCC staging system)  (59). 
 
c. Secondary Endpoints  for determining short- term immune response s to Chemovax  
• P10s -MAP -reactive immunoglobulin titers : The anti -P10s binding level will be measured via 
ELISA method after incubation with a subject’s serum or plasma sample.  
○ The P10s -MAP -reactive immunoglobulin titers will be determined on each subject from 
serum and plasma samples drawn as specified in the study calendar . 
 
• Anti-TACA cell -binding level : The anti -TACA cell -binding level will be measured via flow -
cytometry methods as the median fluorescence intensity of TACA -expressing tumor cells 
obtained after incubation with a subject’s serum or plasma sample.

 ○ The anti -TACA cell -binding level will be determined on each subject from serum and 
plasma samples drawn as specified in the study calendar . 
 
• Anti-breast -cancer cytotoxicity : The cytotoxicity of a sample towards a breast cancer cell line 
will be measured as the percent decrease (relative to a control) in the cells’ survival following 
incubation with pre-  and postimmune serum and plasma.  
○ The anti -breast -cancer cytotoxicity will be determined on each subject from serum and 
plasma samples drawn as specified in the study calendar . 
 
• Frequencies of circulating T cells, B cells, NK cells,  and regulatory T cells (Tregs):  Peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated and the above populations of immune cells 
will be determined by [CONTACT_4133]. See Section f  below for additional details . 
 
• Activation profiles of NK cells:  Activated -NK-cell profiles will be determined via flow cytometry 
as the expression levels of different activation markers on NK cells in the subject’s blood 
sample. See Section f  below for additional details . 
 
• Functionality of T cells and NK cells:  Effector functio ns will be determined through stimulation 
with anti -CD3-coated plates, phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Sigma) and tumor cell lysate, and 
production of cytokines will be measured.  The effector function of NK cells will be measured 
by [CONTACT_703433] (ADCC) assay monoclonal antibodies or  using serum 
samples. See Section f  below for additional details . 
 
• Biomarkers of response and efficacy:  The expression of glycan antigens and 
proliferation/apoptosis markers will be determined on tumor tissues.  
 
• Characterize infiltrating lymphocytes:  TILs will be characterized and frequency of 
subpopulation with efficacy will be correlated.  
 
d. Secondary Endpoints for determining persistence of  immune response s 
We will further determine the persistence of a subject’s  immune responses upon treatment with 
the Chemovax  therapy . 
 
• The anti -P10s antibody titer will be determined on each subject’s serum and plasma samples 
drawn approximately 6 and 12 months, as specified in the study calendar . 
• The anti -TACA cell -binding level will be determined on each subject’s serum and plasma 
samples drawn approximately 6 and 12 months as specified i n the study calendar.  
• The anti -breast -cancer cytotoxicity will be determined on each subject’s serum and plasma 
samples drawn approximatel y 6 and 12 months as s pecified in the study calendar.  
• Functionality of T and NK cells will be evaluated.  
 
e. Tolerability and Safety Endpoints  
Subjects will receive [ADDRESS_1084377] assessments per  the study calendar defined in the protocol. Subjects will be 
followed until resolution of toxicity. There will be no dose modifications for toxicity.  
 
The NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 will be used for toxicity and SAE reporting. A copy of the CTCAE 
Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) home page. All appropriate treatment areas have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0.

The study will be paused upon Death (other than disease progression or motor vehicle accident) 
or two Grade 4 Toxicity events that are possibly/probably related to the study agent . 
 The endpoints used to monitor tolerability will mirror safety endpoints, and will be classified into reactogenicity endpoints and vaccine- related AEs, the most serious of which will be reported as 
SAEs. Reactogenicity endpoints will be further divided i nto: (1) systemic symptoms that include 
fever, malaise, and myalgia; and (2) local symptoms that include pain, tenderness, and induration at the injection site.  
 
f. Assay methods for determining the endpoints will follow established SOPs  
The following are bri ef descriptions of the methods by [CONTACT_703434]’s endpoints will be 
determined.  
 
• Sample cytotoxicity towards MDA -MB-231 and HCC1954:  This assay will be conducted on 
both serum samples and plasma samples . Cells from each cell line will be grown in 24- well 
plates, and exposed in triplicate to the samples from each subject, and to fetal bovine serum (FBS) as a control . Cells will be incubated for 24, 48 and 72 hours, after which wells will be 
photographed and then dead cells and debris will be removed and viable cells will be fixed and 
stained. More pi[INVESTIGATOR_703406]. The number of alive cells in sample- treated wells will be expressed as a percentage 
of the number of cells in FBS -treated wells.  
 
• Anti-P10s antibody titer : In each sample, the anti -peptide reactivity will be determined by 
[CONTACT_787888] P10s -MAP adhered to 96- well microtiter plates, with secondary antibody 
being HRP -conjugated anti-human antibody . Endpoint titers will be determined from 
reactivities via the serial 2- fold dilution method. Both the IgG titer and the IgM titer will be 
determined.  
 
• Binding of antibody to TACA -expressing tumor cells : From each sample, aliquots w ill be 
removed and used to incubate 1- to-[ADDRESS_1084378] -cancer cell 
lines: MCF -7 (which expresses LeY), MDA -MB-231 (which expresses gangliosides), and 
HCC1954 . Serum -incubated cells will be post -incubated with FITC -labeled goat antihuman 
antibody, then fed through the flow cytometer . The median fluorescence intensity of the treated 
cells will be determined and reported as the measure of binding of serum antibody to TACA -
expressing tumor cells . The monoclonal antibodies BR55- 2 and 14G2a will be used as positive 
controls . 
 
• Determining NK -cell activation:  To count the number of NK cells in a blood sample, PBMCs 
will be separated from blood using Histopaque® (Sigma), washed and stained with anti -CD3 
and anti -CD56  (BD biosciences) , and the number of cells that are determined to be CD3-
/CD56+ will be counted and used as the total number of NK cells in the sample. To determine 
the expression levels of activation markers CD69, CD94, CD16, and NKp46, cells will be 
stained with a third color specific for each marker . The expression level of each activation 
marker will be determined in CD3-/CD56+ cells (NK cells) via flow cytometry as either the 
median or geometric mean of the marker’s fluorescence- intensity histogram .

Page 50 of 59 
 • Determine T -cell and B -cell subpopulations : Both lymphocytes and CD3+ cells will be stained 
for CD4 and CD8 markers. The CD19+ B cell subpopulations , including naive B cells (IgD+ 
CD27-), marginal zone- like/natural effector B cells (IgD+ CD27+), class -switched memory B 
cells (IgD- CD27+), transitional B cells (IgM++ CD38++) and plasmablasts (IgM- CD383+) will be 
determined. Percentage of CD40+, CD69+, CD83+ and IgG+ CD19 B -cells will be determined.  
 
• Determine T -cell subpopulations:  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated 
by [CONTACT_521479] -Paque™ solution. Lymphocytes will be stained 
and the expression levels of CD69, PD -1, and CTLA -4 among CD4 and CD8 T cells will be 
determined. The regulatory subpopulation of CD4+/CD25hi/CD127-/lo (FOXP3+) and MDSC 
populations with granulocytic (Lin- HLA-DR-/lo CD15+ CD33+ CD11b+) and monocytic (HLA -DR-
/lo CD14+) phenotype will be determined. The expression of PD -L1 on monocytes will also be 
determined. The above cell populations will be assessed and assays performed in each 
subject’s pre-  and post -immune blood samples and c omparisons will be made to understand 
whether vaccination affects immune cell profile and function.  
 
• Proliferation assay and cytokine detection:  The effector functions through stimulation of T cells 
with P10s and P10s -PADRE peptides, tumor cell lysate, and anti -CD3-coated plates will be 
conducted and production of cytokines will be measured. 2x10^5 PBMCs will be incubated in 
200 µl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% heat inactivated fetal calf serum. Proliferation will be induced using P10s, P10s -PADRE, PHA (10  μg/ml), anti -CD3-coated plates (5 μg/ml) or 
lysate of a representative breast cancer cell line.  After 24 (PHA or anti -CD3) to 72 (tumor 
lysate) hours of incubation 3H thymidine will be added and incubated for another 8 hours. Cells 
stimulated with lysate may need another round of stimulation (total of 6 days) before thymidine addition. A fraction of supernatant from each well will be collected before thymidine addition 
for detection of cytokines by [CONTACT_6428].  The cells will be harvested and 3H thymidine incorporation 
determined using a liquid scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer Inc.) and expressed as counts per minute (cpm). The stimulation index ( SI) will be obtained by [CONTACT_703436]/control cpm. 
PBMCs that had not been subjected to PHA addition will be used as controls. The collected 
supernatant will be frozen and kept at -80ºC. Supernatants will thawed and used for detection 
of cytokines (IFN -γ, IL-2, TNFα, IL -4, IL-10, and IL- 13) by [CONTACT_703437] R&D Systems.  
 
• ELISPOT assay:  ELISPOT will be used to further confirm T -cell effector function.  PBMCs will 
be stimulated with P10s, P10s -PADREE, tumor cell lysate, and anti -CD3 and cytokin e 
secretion profile will be determined using human BD™ ELISPOT kit set following 
manufacturer’s instructions.  
 
• ADCC assay:  ADCC assays will be performed to evaluate functionality of post -immune serum 
in inducing immune cell -mediated cell death and compare it to pre -immune serum for each 
subject, where breast cancer cell lines will be used as targets. Target cells will be labelled with calcein AM and 10^4 cells per well in 50 µl of medium will be added to 96 well microtiter plates 
and then 50 µl serum will be added and incubated for 30 minutes.  Effector cells will be added 
in 100µl volume of medium to give serially diluted effector:target cell ratios (E:T) with maximum E:T of 50:1.  Primarily, PBMCs from healthy donors or NK -92 cells will be used as effectors.  
After 4 hours of incubation imaging with Cytation ™ 5 cell imaging reader (BioTek, Winooski, 
VT) will be performed to count live target cells in wells with and without effector cells and 
percent cytotoxicity will be calculated as [1- (calcein AM target cell s with effector cells /calcein 
AM target cells without effector cell)]X100. In separate experiments, pre-  and post -immune 
PBMCs from responder subjects will be compared using mAb BR55- 2 (mediates ADCC on 
LeY-positive cells). This will show whether vaccinat ion results in more potent effector cells.

 • Immunohistochemistry:  In those subjects with enough pathological specimens, t umor -tissue 
slides  will be requested from tissue  collected at both the original biopsy before treatment  (2 
H&E and 8 unstained slides)  and at time of  definitive surgery  (2 H&E and 8  unstained slides) . 
The tumor -tissue slides from the original biopsy will be compared to the tumor -tissue slides 
from surgery in order to learn more about the mechanism of action. These slides will be stained 
for anti -glycan mAbs (anti -LeY and GD2 mAb), to evaluate potential correlation of expression 
of LeY and GD2 gangliosides levels with clinical response. Caspase- 3 and activated caspase-
3 (Abcam Inc., MA) expression will also  be determined. K i67 staining will be performed and its 
expression determined. Besides pCR, potential tumor response by [CONTACT_787889].  Staining of provided slides  will be performed by [CONTACT_787890] . To perform these  analyses, a total of 4 H&E slides and 
16 unstained will be requested, whenever available,  for each procedure (half from original 
biopsy and half from tissues collected at surgery ) per subject . 
 
• Characterization of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs):  The characterization of TILs in tumor 
tissues of subjects of this study is planned to help us to understand whether vaccination 
efficacy relate to pre- treatment immune infiltrates or whether vaccination affect lymphocyte 
infiltration and th e composition of the infiltrates.  We also seek to understand whether any 
response to vaccination is associated with immune infiltrates and their compositions. 
Therefore, we will first evaluate H&E and Ki67 expression in tumor specimens collected at 
origina l biopsy before treatment and tissues collected at surgery. Whenever available, t umor -
tissue slides will be requested to perform staining to detect subpopulations of infiltrating 
immune cells. S taining will be perfor med with anti -CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -FOXP3, a nd -CD56 
mAbs  (two slides per antibody from both biopsy and surgery) . In addition to the slides for 
immunohistochemistry, 20 unstained slides (half from original biopsy and half from tissues collected at surgery) will be requested per subject for TILs char acterization. S taining will be 
performed through the UAMS Experimental Pathology Core Facility.  
 
• Genome- wide gene expression and methylation analyses using plasma, immune  and tumor  
cells:  Genetic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_703407], immune cells and  tumors before 
and after immunization will be explored to study the potential biomarkers of immune and tumor 
responses.  
 
14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
General Considerations:  The primary objectives of this multi -center study  are (1)  to identify a 
Chemovax sc hedule that is “feasible” in the sense of being safe, tolerable, and capable of generating 
adequate immune response in enough subjects , and (2) determine if ER -positive breast -cancer 
subjects treated with the Chemovax  regimen experience a significantly  higher rate of  pCR than ER -
positive subjects treated with SoC  neoadjuvant chemotherapy . The size of the study population was 
purposely chosen to provide adequate power  (>90%)  to properly evaluate the clinical efficacy of the 
vaccine -chemotherapy combinati on. In addition, the translational effectiveness  of any cancer vaccine 
in a large population depends on both the level and the functionality of the resultant immune 
responses.  
 
Analysis Plan for Primary Feasibility Endpoint : To evaluate the feasibility of eliciting adequate 
immune response with P10s -PADRE when it is administered in combination with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, we will sequentially evaluate different schedules of vaccination relative to 
chemotherapy, and stop evaluating as soon as we have ident ified a feasible schedule. Immune -
response adequacy will be evaluated using the previously described Schedule Evaluation Rule and 
will be defined as four or more of the 5 subjects exhibit a ≥4-fold increase in anti -P10s serum IgG titer 
at Week 7 or later  (at least [ADDRESS_1084379] immunization)  relative to pre- immune .

Page 52 of 59 
 Analysis Plan for Primary Efficacy Endpoint : If a feasible Chemovax  schedule is identified, then 
that schedule’s  cohort will be expanded  and used to initiate the primary efficacy  evaluation of 
Chemovax  using a Simon optimal two -stage design ( 60, 61). 
 
The following is a Simon two -stage optimal design intended to test the null hypothesis that the pCR 
rate with Chemovax  will be 8% or less versus the alternative that the pCR rate with Chemovax  will be  
23% or more . Nineteen subject s will be accrued, treated with Chemova x, and evaluated during the 
first stage of the primary efficacy evaluation. If one or none achieve pCR, then the trial will be 
terminated for futility; if two or more achieve pCR, then the second stage of the primary efficacy 
evaluation will open . If the s econd stage opens, it will accrue [ADDRESS_1084380] s will be accrued, treated with Chemovax , and evaluated. If and only if the total number of 
subjects who achieve pCR is 6 or more, then the null hypothesis (that the pCR  rate is ≤ 8%) will be 
rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis (that the pCR rate is ≥ 23%). When the null hypothesis 
is true, this design will have a true Type I error rate of 9.6% , and an expected sample size of 29.03 
based on a 54.4% probability of early termination. This design will attain 90.8% power to reject the null 
hypothesis in favor of the alternative when the true rate of pCR is  23%. 
 
Determination of Sample Size : The primary efficacy  evaluation just described will be preceded by  
[CONTACT_28740]- response feasibility stage during which a sequence of  up to five schedules of vaccination 
relative to chemotherapy will be evaluated. Each schedule will accrue a coho rt of five subjects, and 
be evaluated using the previously described Schedule Evaluation Rule to identify a feasible  Chemovax 
schedule that does not interfere with subjects’ ability to mount an adequate IgG response. Therefore:  
1. If a feasible Chemovax schedule is identified, then there could be from zero to [ADDRESS_1084381] s, and a 
theoretical maximum of  61 subjects . 
 Analysis Plans for Secondary Endpoints : To analyze the secondary endpoints, data will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_703441], standard deviations, medians, and ranges, and displayed 
graphically using profile plots and box plots. Residuals analysis will be used to examine adherence to 
distributional assumptions, and data transformations will be applied if warranted. Each endpoint will 
be analyzed longitudinally using either generalized estimating equations or mixed- models analysis . In 
particular, post -immune levels of each endpoint will be compared to its pre- immune level for (a) 
occurrence of a significant increase, and (b) durati on of the significant increase if one occurred. In 
addition, subjects will be classified individually with respect to each endpoint as a “responder” if any 
of that endpoint’s post -immune levels attains an increase of at least two folds relative to its pre- immune 
level, and the number and proportion of “responders” with respect to each endpoint will be reported. 
Finally, a mixed- models regression approach will be used to determine how much of the samples’ 
cytotoxicity towards HCC1954 and MDA -MB-231 can be pr edicted by [CONTACT_42327].  
 
Missing, Unused and Spurious Data:  Missing data will be treated as missing, and will not be 
imputed. All data collected will necessarily be reported to the FDA . Spurious data will be corrected at 
the source document . Any data documented as spurious that is unable to be corrected at the source 
will be treated as missing.

 Data Safety Monitoring Plan:  AEs and safety will be evaluated throughout the study by a Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB will meet at predetermined intervals set forth in the DSMB 
Charter to review toxicities and serious and/or unexpected AEs. The DSMB will primarily evaluate 
safety data; efficacy data will only be reviewed in the event of a serious safety concern. Minutes for all DSMB meetings will be generated.  
 
15. REGISTRATION GUIDELINES  
 
Screening logs will be maintained by  [CONTACT_787891] . 
 
Subject registrat ion will occur in Clinical Trials Office (CTO) within the UAMS WPRCI  after the IRB -
approved consent is signed and eligibility has been confirmed. Subjects will be registered in the Clinical Trial Management Suite (CTMS) and will be assigned a study number by [CONTACT_670348] . The study 
number will be used for identification of the res earch subject during the study.  
 HOG will send registrations to research staff at  CTO . CTO  will register the subject in the CTMS and 
will assign  each subject  a study number. Once registration has been completed, the information will 
be sent back to HOG.  
 
16. DATA SUBMISSION SCHEDULE  
 
Data must be submitted according to protocol requirements for ALL subjects registered to the 
treatment portion of this trial , whether or not assigned treatment is administered.  
 
For subjects deemed to be ineligible to participate in the study or for whom documentation is 
inadequate to determine eligibility , only the eligibility case report form will be completed. Data obtained 
during the study will be collected at each subject visit and entered into the clinical trial management suite .. Data will be captured on the case report forms (CRFs).  
 
UAMS and HOG shall retain the records and reports for 2 years after a mark eting application is 
approved for the drug; or, if an application is not approved for the drug, until 2 years after shipment and delivery  of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and the FDA has been notified.  After 
such time all study records w ill be destroyed as well as links between identifiers of the research 
subjects and their study numbers according to U AMS’ record destruction policy.  
 
17. ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
a. Study Personnel:  Study personnel must have completed training in G ood Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and Protection of Human Subjects.  
 
b. Recruitment and Informed Consent:  Potential subjects will be recruited from the WPRCI  on the 
UAMS campus and clinics at HOG. The potential subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_787892] . Prior to any research activities, the potential subject will be approached for 
participation in the study by [CONTACT_140711], who will discuss the protocol along with the risks and 
potential benefits of participating in it. A clear statement will be made concerning the voluntary 
nature of her participation and that her decision will have no effect on her remaining care. The 
research nurse or research staff will follow with a detailed review of the informed consent 
document. The potential  subject wil l be encouraged to have family or friends participate in any or 
all of the process . The potential subject will be given time to ask questions, will be questioned to 
be certain she understands the information, and if she agrees to proceed, will sign consent . 
Subject s will be allowed time to reflect, ask questions or withdraw. The consent process will be 
documented in the medical record. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the 
Vaccination of High Risk Breast Cancer Patients  IRB 202556 & 204187  
Sponsor: UAMS  
Version 21 
06/02/[ADDRESS_1084382] file . The consent process will 
occur in a private exam room. There will be no additional recruitment materials. The principles of 
informed consent are described by [CONTACT_60836] (21CFR50) and the Office for 
Human Research Protections: Protection of Human Subjects (Code of Federal Regulations 
45CFR46) . These principles must be followed to comply with FDA regulations for the conduct and 
monitoring of clinical investigations.  
 
c. Institutional Review:  This study will be approved by [CONTACT_30107] ’ IRBs as defined by [CONTACT_631044] 21CFR56 and the Office for Human Research Protections: Protection of Human Subjects 45CFR46. This study will also undergo scientific review by [CONTACT_491904]’s 
Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRM C). Approval by [CONTACT_787893].  
 
d. Investigational Agent Accountability:  Documentation of  drug disposition (drug receipt, 
dispensing, transfer or return) wi ll be maintained on the UAMS Investigational Agent Accountability 
Record or its equivalent that is on file with FDA . Drug supplies (long- term storage) will be kept in 
a secure, limited access storage area under the recommended storage conditions in the research pharmacy at the WPRCI  under the direction of the research pharmacist . During the course of the 
study, the following information will be noted on the Investigational Agent Accountability Record; 
the study number, the research subject’s initials, the research subject’s assigned number, the dose 
of drug, the date(s) and quantity of drug dispensed to the subject, the balance forward, the lot number and the recorder’s initials. These Investigational Agent Accountability Records will be 
readily available for inspection and are open to FDA inspection at any time.  
 
e. Dissemination of Data:  The data collected in this study may be used for presentations, poster s, 
and publications or uploaded into open or controlled- access databases , like NIH database of 
genotypes and phenotypes and Gene expression omnibus, upon request. The publications or data 
uploaded will not contain any identifiable information that could be linked to a participant. We are 
fully committed to the responsible data sharing and therefore, the de- identified data, including 
analyzed and raw, supporting the conclusions made in any publications will be made available to 
any qualified researcher upon legitimate request. The study will be listed on clinicaltrials.gov in 
accordance with FDA requirements.  
 
18. ADVERSE EVENTS 
 Following consent , safety will be measured by [CONTACT_787894], which is approximately [ADDRESS_1084383] vaccination.  
 a. Adverse Event (AE): Any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or  procedure. Each AE is a unique representation of a specific 
event used for medical documentation and scientific analysis . [ICH E6 1.2] 
 
b. Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following out comes: death, a life- threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity or a congenital anomaly/birth defect . Important medical events that may not 
result in death, be life threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse 
drug experience when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outco mes listed in this definition. FDA 
requires IND sponsors to report qualified AEs and SAEs through the expedited reporting system.

 To avoid confusion, as the terms “serious” and “severe” are not synonymous, the following 
clarification is given: The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event (as in mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not  the same as “serious,” 
which is based on subject/event outcome or action  usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. [ICH -E2A(II)(B)]  
 
c. Related : An event is related if more likely than not it was  caused by [CONTACT_423875].  
 
d. Unexpected : An event is unexpected when its specificity, nature, severity or incidence is not 
accurately reflected in the consent form, protocol, or investigator’s brochure previously reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_1201]. Exa mples include a lower rate of response to treatment or a side effect 
that is more severe than initially expected.  
 
e. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of AEs:  All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the 
study. Assessments may include monitoring the s ubject’s clinical symptoms; laboratory, 
pathological, radiological, or surgical findings; physical examination; or other appropriate tests and 
procedures.  
 Any condition, laboratory abnormality, or physical finding with an onset date prior to the subject signing consent for study participation is considered to be pre- existing in nature and part of the 
subject’s medical history. All relevant historical medical conditions that are known/diagnosed prior to the administration of study vaccine are to be recorded. All AEs, which  completely resolve and 
then recur,  should be recorded as a new AE, regardless of whether it is related or not. In addition 
to new events, any increase in the severity or frequency of a pre- existing condition that occurs 
after the administr ation of the first vaccine is considered an AE.  
 All AEs occurring during the study period must be recorded. The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study 
treatment or participation is not the cause. SAEs that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed for up to [ADDRESS_1084384] be recorded in the appropriate section of the CRF . The report should 
include, whenever possible, the investigator’s written medical judgment as to the relationship of the AE/SAE to the vaccine and/or to the study (not the chemotherapy) (i.e., “definite”, “probable”, 
“possible” or “unrelated”).  
 
Expedited Reporting:  Any instance of a Guillain- Barre Syndrome event will require expedited 
reporting to the FDA, IRB, and IND Sponsor.  
 AEs that are serious, unanticipated/unexpected, and possibly related to the vaccine qualify for 
expedited reporting. Any adverse experience that meets expedited reporting guidelines for SAEs 
must be reported immediately to the Sponsor . The CRA  will follow AE reporting plans per 
institutional policies and applicable regulations. All qualified AEs will be reported to the Investigators, FDA, IRB, Medical Monitor, and the UAMS Office of Research Regulatory Affairs  
(Sponsor) according to this plan. The Sponsor will report all events that meet expedited reporting 
requirements to FDA in accordance with 21CFR312. All other AEs will be reported to the Sponsor 
and FDA in the Annual Progress Report.

 Only AEs meeting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] (Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others) will 
be reported to the UAMS IRB within the required 10 -day allotment of being notified of the event. 
UPI[INVESTIGATOR_631020]: a) 
unanticipated or unexpected; b) related to the research; and c) involves new or increased risk to 
the subject(s). All other AE s should be recorded and reported to the UAMS IRB at continuing 
review.  
 
Deaths that are related to research will be reported to the Sponsor immediately upon Investigator 
notification. A death due to a terminal condition of the research participant would be considered 
anticipated and not related to the research  and will be reported at continuing review and the Annual 
Progress Report.  
 
19. CLINICAL SITE MONITORING  
 
Clinical site monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_190549] (ORRA) 
to ensure that the rights and well -being of human subjects are protected, that the reported trial data 
are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents, and that the conduct of the trial is in 
compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
 Monitoring specialists from ORRA will conduct periodic on- site, comprehensive monitoring as 
determined by a protocol specific monitoring plan, which will be provided by [CONTACT_787895].  
 
20. DEVIATIONS AND VIOLATIONS  
 
a. Protocol Deviation: A deviation is any unintentional change, divergence, or departure from the 
study design or procedures defined in the protocol. Protocol deviations will be tracked and compi[INVESTIGATOR_40177] a Prot ocol Deviation Log. Deviations that potentially cause concern for the subject 
health, safety, or rights will be reported to the Sponsor as soon as possible for guidance on reporting.  
 b. Protocol Violation: A violation is a change to, or non- compliance wit h, the IRB -approved 
procedures without prior Sponsor and IRB approval (excluding changes made to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazard to subjects). A violation may affect health, safety, or rights of a subject. 
Any violation will be reported immediately to the Sponsor for guidance on reporting.  
 If the protocol deviation/protocol violation does not represent a significant alteration in the approved 
protocol and/or affect the safety or welfare of the subject, it will be reported to the UAMS IRB at the 
time of  Continuing Review. If the protocol deviation/violation represents a significant alteration in the 
approved protocol and/or if it affects the safety or welfare of the subject, it must be reported to the 
Sponsor and UAMS IRB immediately.

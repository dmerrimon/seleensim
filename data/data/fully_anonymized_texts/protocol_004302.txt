Study Background and Rationale
4.1.
Background
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep breathing disorder that affects an estimated 54 million
Americans (calculated based on a 16-country prevalence data study),
1,2
and is associated with
heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and other life-threatening conditions. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_622626]’s high prevalence and increasing public awareness, past research has shown that
approximately [ADDRESS_829077] frequently as excessive daytime tiredness, increased lapses or
micro-sleeps during important activities such as driving, nighttime disturbances to bed partners
(largely through snoring or restlessness)
[ADDRESS_829078] importantly signiﬁcantly increased
risk and severity of multiple comorbidities including but not limited to cardiovascular disease
(CVD)
5-6
, type 2 diabetes (T2D)
[ADDRESS_829079] pressure (PAP)
device. PAP provides positive pressure to support a patent airway for patients who experience
clinically signiﬁcant frequency of apneas and/or hypopneas
[ADDRESS_829080] the nose. This device is, as can readily be imagined, diﬃcult to introduce
into the patient’s bedtime routine, life, travel, etc. No other treatment or therapy for OSA has been
shown to be as effective as PAP
11
. Any method of increasing
compliance with the patient’s

prescribed therapy could thus decrease both the cost of care for relevant comorbidities as well as
signiﬁcantly improve the patient’s quality of life.
4.2.
Rationale
This study seeks to understand patient journey and PAP therapy compliance for Verily Sleep
Apnea (VSA) program users.
The VSA app is intended to help individuals who may have OSA go through the complex
diagnostic pathway more eﬃciently and virtually. The VSA app is also intended to help patients
who have been diagnosed with OSA to manage their therapy and is intended to facilitate a
program where users can possibly discover their potential risk for OSA through a clinically
validated questionnaire screener and consult with a healthcare professional.
The VSA app will also allow participants to message with Health Coaches who will provide
guidance related to sleep and OSA. Communication between the Health Coach and participant is
important in enhancing and promoting motivation for PAP adherence
. The motivational
enhancement approach is a published behavioral intervention based on the principles of
motivational interviewing
12
.  Its fundamental premise
is to honor the natural ambivalence that
accompanies any change to behavior and to approach the patient in a thoughtful and empathetic
manner that elicits critical thought - in order to maximize behavior change.
Technology, especially mobile technology, has the potential to provide new, easier to use, more
timely, and more scalable methods for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_622627], onboarding
patients with OSA to PAP treatment, as well as helpi[INVESTIGATOR_622628].

The participant may also be discontinued from the research study at any time if the Investigator 
considers it to be in his/her best medical interest. The Investigator may withdraw the participant
any time due to the non-compliance with respect to the provisions of the protocol. If a participant
withdraws prior to study completion, no new health information identifying him/her will be
gathered after that date. Information that has been gathered may still be used and given to
others.
If an enrolled participant withdraws or is discontinued prior to completing all study activities, a 
new, qualiﬁed candidate may be enrolled in the study to compensate for the incomplete data set.
Participants will either satisfactorily complete all requirements set forth in the protocol or their 
participation in the clinical study will be prematurely terminated. The completion of a participant’s
participation in the study or early departure from the study, including reasons for early
discontinuation, will be fully documented on the appropriate case report form and an effort will be
made to connect them with a local clinician for post-study consultation, instructions and, if
indicated, recommendations for follow-up care.

non-compliance and improve compliance moving forward. The study team may also
review device/app setup and troubleshooting to help participants if they become stuck.
Additionally, the study team may reach out to the participant throughout the duration of
the study via phone or email for troubleshooting.
The study team reserves the right to update the VSA app as needed throughout the
course of the study (e.g., to ﬁx newly discovered bugs within the app). A supplemental
visit may be scheduled to review changes associated with app updates.
Once a participant exits the study, either from early exit or completion of study-related
activities, an effort will be made to connect them with a managing physician for
post-study consultation, instructions and, if indicated, recommendations for follow-up
care.  The exit workﬂow will be designed in consultation with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_622629].  For
example, the exit workﬂow includes an attempt by [CONTACT_622639]’s primary care provider to inform them of the study and to provide clinical
recommendations.  Upon exiting the study, participants will also be provided with key
data collected during the study in an "Exit Packet", such as their Sleep Report and
prescription for PAP therapy. A supplemental visit may be scheduled for ﬁnal instruction
and recommendations for follow-up care.

Risk Analysis
7.1.
Risk Analysis
Verily Life Sciences has conducted an analysis of the beneﬁts and risks of the VSA app.
Verily Life Sciences has determined that this clinical investigation is justiﬁed as the overall
potential beneﬁt to the population outweighs its risks.
7.2.
Beneﬁts
Participants at risk of having OSA will have the opportunity to go through the OSA diagnostic
pathway and use a PAP device (if prescribed) at no cost to them.
Proper ty of V erily Lif e Sciences LL C

CPR, Pr otocol, Baseline Sleep A pnea Study #2
Document Number:
There are no other beneﬁts to the participants for participating in this study, but the information
obtained will be used in scientiﬁc research and may be helpful to others in the future.
7.3.
Risks
The VSA app is intended to facilitate an Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) management program. It
is intended to improve the lives of patients who have been diagnosed with OSA to help manage
their therapy and is intended to facilitate a program where users can possibly discover their
potential risk for OSA.
The types of potential risk the volunteer research participants will encounter with the VSA app
are related to risks for releasing participant/patient private health information.  The participant
proﬁle in the VSA app will include personal information including name, contact [CONTACT_3031], and
health information, including PAP usage data. All data sent from the VSA app are encrypted.
Information collected during interviews from study participants will be kept conﬁdential
throughout the study. A unique subject identiﬁcation code will be used when collecting data on
standardized paper or electronic Case Report Forms (CRF/eCRF). Only study team members
trained on the clinical study will have access to the study records. If a participant agrees to
participate in the study, Verily will store the data collected on Google servers. This data will be
restricted to authorized study personnel and access is audited to ensure the privacy of this data.
All data used in the analysis and reporting of this study will be used in a manner without
identiﬁable reference to the study participants.
Though PAP is part of the participants’ clinical care prescribed by [CONTACT_137021], for purposes of
completeness, potential adverse effects of PAP follow.
1.
Skin irritation or rashes
2.
Feelings of claustrophobia when wearing mask
3.
Dry mouth, throat, or nose after wearing the mask
4.
Temporary marks on the skin
5.

9.
Ear or sinus discomfort
Adverse effects/discomfort associated with using PAP and related supplies are considered
anticipated and will not be recorded as an adverse event.
Though the HST is part of the participants’ clinical care prescribed by [CONTACT_137021], for purposes
of completeness, potential adverse effects of HST follow:
1.
Skin irritation
2.
Rash
3.
Allergic reaction
4.
Mild discomfort
Adverse effects/discomfort associated with using an HST and related supplies are considered
anticipated and will not be recorded as an adverse event.

Adverse Events (AE), Serious Adverse Events (SAE), and Unanticipated Problems
During and following a subject's participation in the study, the investigator/institution should ensure that
adequate medical care is provided to a subject for any adverse events related to the trial. The
investigator/institution should inform a subject when medical care is needed for intercurrent illness(es) of
which the investigator becomes aware.
In the event medical care to a subject is required,
the medical care given to, and medical decisions
made
on behalf of, subjects should always be the responsibility of a qualiﬁed physician.
8.1.
Adverse Events
An Adverse Event (AE) is deﬁned as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or
injury in subjects, users or other persons, that is considered a change from baseline or pre-study
status, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.
Any pre-existing medical conditions or symptoms present in a participant will not be considered
an Adverse Event in this study, unless it worsens as a result of this study.
Only health events that are directly related to the VSA app or study procedures will be recorded as
adverse events.
Adverse events related to commercially available FDA-regulated (i.e., cleared or approved)
medical devices (such as PAP, HST and associated supplies) will not be recorded as adverse
events. Anticipated AEs related to the commercially available FDA-regulated devices include the

Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is deﬁned as an adverse event that is anticipated or unanticipated
and which reasonably suggests that one of the manufacturers’ devices has or may have caused
or contributed to a death or serious injury.
A Serious Adverse Event is an Adverse Event that led to: (a) death, (b) serious deterioration in the
health of the subject that either resulted in a (i) life-threatening illness or injury or (ii) permanent
impairment of a body structure or a body function, or (iii) in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109]
(iv) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent
impairment to a body structure or a body function or (c) fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital
abnormality or birth defect.
A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre- existing condition is not considered a SAE.
These events are typi[INVESTIGATOR_622631]. Serious Adverse Events must be
reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.
8.3.
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE)
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) is a serious adverse effect on health or safety or
any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect or
problem was not previously identiﬁed in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or
welfare of subjects. Anticipated potential adverse device effects have been identiﬁed in the
sponsor Risk Management ﬁles and/or product labeling.
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_622632] (UADE) involving
risk to subjects or others will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of event.
All UADE’s will be evaluated and the results of such evaluation will be reported to the IRB within
ten (10) working days after the event is reported by [CONTACT_174897]. The sponsor will report all
SAE’s and UADE’s to the appropriate regulatory authority. All Serious and Unanticipated Adverse
Effects will be reviewed by a Medical Monitor.

Study and Site Closure
The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site (decentralized) or terminate the
study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed
upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study
supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause
and suﬃcient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_622643]:
●
Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB or
local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines
●
Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_093]
11.8.
Publication Policy
●
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientiﬁc meetings. If this is
foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor
before submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to
provide comments.
●
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In
accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally
support publication of multisite studies only in their entirety and not as individual site
data. In this case, a coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12992].
12.
Statistical Considerations
The study plans to enroll approximately 50-200 individuals that will be diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep
Apnea (OSA) and begin PAP therapy, as part of the study procedures.  It is recognized that the sample
size achieved in this baseline study will likely be insuﬃcient for statistical hypothesis testing, but it will
still be useful for establishing a baseline understanding of the performance of the VSA program.  The
primary endpoints of interest are ﬁve timelines relating to the patient diagnostic and treatment journey:
●
Time (number of days) from when participant is told they may have OSA to OSA diagnosis
○
Time (number of days) from when participant is told they may have OSA to when they
receive HST prescription
○
Time (number of days) from when participant receives HST prescription to OSA
diagnosis
●
Time (number of days) from OSA diagnosis to PAP therapy initiation
●
Time (number of days) from therapy initiation to when 90-day compliance threshold is achieved
Each of these will be reported as a point estimate accompanied by a conﬁdence interval.  These will be
calculated from the average and standard deviation of these timeframes across all participants.

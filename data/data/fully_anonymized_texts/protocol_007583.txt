Context: 
African and African American individuals are inadequately represented in clinical trials 
data—impacting the relevance of these trials to diseases that affect them. Although studies have demonstrated the value of video, little is known about the value of incorporating appeals to promote inclusion. 
Objectives :
 
This study will assess whether video-based inclusion appeals improve African American 
children’s enrollment into the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP) research study registry.  
Study Design:  
The study will consist of two phases: a qualitative research phase and a randomized controlled trial phase. 
Setting/Participants:  
Phase 1 involves parents from the CHOP Research Family Partners and utilizes 
consensus/voting to review study design and materials. Phase [ADDRESS_863564] in the CHOP primary care waiting rooms.  Ninety parents who self-identify as English-speaking African/Af rican American adults will be enrolled.  
Study Interventions and Measures :  
Phase 1 has been described above. Phase 2 study participants will complete a demographic survey, before being randomized to receive one of three interventions:
 
1. Short description of the registry 
2. video with inclusion appeal, questions about the perceived effectiveness of the video 
3. video without inclusion appeal, questions about the perceived effectiveness of the video.  
All participants will be invited to join a study enrollment registry.

The intervention will be a short video segment added to an informational video about 
Pediatric Clinical Research Study that will be tailored to appeal to the need for an inclusive population of study participants in clinical trials.  For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will target African/African American participants.

these videos and did not publish any evaluation of the message’s effectiveness at conveying 
its intended message. For example, a recent study by [CONTACT_645195]6 investigated 
the role of an educational video on clinical trial enrollment among ethnic minorities. It showed no effect; however, it utilized a DVD -based intervention that was only watched by 
[CONTACT_645196], which the authors acknowledged as a limitation. Finally, none of these projects appear to have included any sort of message that specifically appealed to a target audience.  Appeals  are a well -established approach in communication that utilize evidence 
or emotional triggers to persuade the receiver to change his or her behavior.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Our research objective is to identify components of video messages that motivate behavior 
change.  
2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim)  
The primary objective is to c ompare intent to enroll in a research discovery site after seeing 
a video with an inclusion appeal versus one without such an appeal—focusing on parents 
and guardians who identify as African or African American.

2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim)  
The secondary objective of this study is to a ssess message effectiveness and targetedness  of 
a video inviting African/African American parents to participate in clinical trials involving 
their children. 
[ADDRESS_863568] at the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP) to construct a library of messages aimed at improving parents’ knowledge about, and willingness to participate in, clinical research. Although some of these videos are constructed, none focus on the specific question that will be the focus of this research. We will work closely with a subset of CHOP’s Research Family Partners (RFP), who will assist with all aspects of script development, tailoring to the diverse community served by [CONTACT_137108], and evaluation plan. The RFP will help us to identify at least two patient families who identify as African American wo have participated in trials to interview and record for this project. The rough video will be validated by a sample of RFP members who identify as being from a historically marginalized group. We will pri marily evaluate perceived message effectiveness, using the 
six-item survey developed by [CONTACT_645197].
11 We will make iterative changes to 
the rough video until its perceived effectiveness averages 4.0 or greater on a 1 –5 scale.  We will create a separate video segment for the inclusion appeal. This separate segment will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_645198] a similar method before being edited into a copy of the video. Once the video and inclusion appeal messages are finalized (we anticipate this taking no more than 3 meetings), we will finalize the two videos and complete post-production to incorporate background music, improve color, audio balance and edit transitions.  
Once the videos are created and validated, we will conduct a 3 -arm randomized trial, 
focusing on parents with children cared for by [CONTACT_645199]- identify as African or 
African Americans proficient in verbal and written English, and with no history of prior trial participation. We will work with the RFP to identify the ideal settings for recruitment, which may include clinics, community settings, and online social media sites. We are currently 
   
30 January 2020  
planning to invite participants to complete the study at a Penn or CHOP facility, rather than 
at home. Study participants will complete materials using an online survey completion and video display system (REDCap or Qualtrics). Each participant will complete questions about their age, gender identity, race/ethnicity, education attainment, and their child’s age and gender identity. We will then ask a subset of questions from the NIH Health Information National Trends Survey to assess clinical trials knowledge. After these questions, all eligible participants will be randomly show neither one of two videos (with or without the inclusion appeal) followed by a short survey about perceived effectiveness of the message or taken directly to the final question. The final question will ask if they are willing to receive messages about potential clinical trials for their child. If they select yes, they will be taken to the enrollment screen for the registry above and will be given assistance by [CONTACT_645200].  
Each participant will be paid $[ADDRESS_863569] 
80% power to detect a difference with a 0.[ADDRESS_863570] of the 
experimental video on dependent variables.

30 January 2020  
4.1 Visit 1 (Phase 2)  
Detailed description of study visit including all procedures.  
Potential participants will be invited to enroll in the study based on scheduled information 
and self -identified race/ethnicity.  
Upon arrival to clinic, potential participants will complete a brief screening form related to the inclusion criteria (English proficiency, able to watch a video or see an image, African/ African American race). If inclusion criteria are met, they will rec eive informed consent 
form (with review and discussion) and be asked to sign it. 
Participants will complete an online survey containing: (1) demographic questions (their 
age, gender identity, education attainment, and their child’s age and gender identity); (2) clinical trials knowledge, using a subset of questions from the NIH Health Information National Trends survey 
Participants will be randomly shown either: (1) one of two videos (with or without the 
inclusion appeal) followed by a short survey about perceived effectiveness of the message; or (2) a paragraph and image describing the CHOP Research Discovery Finder. 
Participants will be asked if they are willing to receive messages about potential clinical 
trials for their child from the CHOP Research Discovery Finder. If they select yes, they will 
be taken to the enrollment screen for the registry above and will be given assistance by [CONTACT_645201].  
Each participant will be paid $[ADDRESS_863574] Completion/Withdrawal 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  The Investigator 
or the Sponsor (if applicable) may also withdraw subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect 
the subject for reasons of safety or for administrative reasons.  It will be documented whether or not 
each subject completes the study.  
Early Termination Study Visit  
Subjects who withdraw from the study after the study has begun and at least one question has been answered on the survey (out of time, lack of willingness or ability to continue, etc.) will be 
compensated as if the study had been completed.

summaries (e.g. means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and percentages for categorical variables such as gender).  
5.3.2 Efficacy Analysis 
For our assessment of differences between the three groups’ intent to enroll, we will use a 
series of one- way between -group analyses of variance to determine the impact of the 
experimental video vs. control video vs. no video on enrollment intent. 
5.[ADDRESS_863576] 80% power to detect a difference with a 0.[ADDRESS_863577] a family’s ability to complete the study, we plan to enroll 90 patients to account for this attrition.  
5.5 Interim Analysis  
Interim analysis will not be necessary for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
6 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported to the IRB in accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that do not meet prompt reporting requirements will be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review (if continuing reviews are required), or will be tracked and documented internally by [CONTACT_319593] (if continuing reviews are not required).  
6.[ADDRESS_863578] who has received an intervention (drug, biologic, or other intervention).  The occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
   
30 January 2020  
All AEs (including serious AEs) will be noted in the study records and on the case report 
form with a full description including the nature, date and time of onset, determination of non-serious versus serious, intensity (mild, moderate, severe), duration, causality, and outcome of the event. 
6.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• death,  
• a life -threatening event (at risk of death at the time of the event),  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject.   
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug event when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs.  A severe AE is a major 
event of its type.  A severe AE does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, nausea which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but would not be an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke, but would be an SAE.  
6.2.1 Relationship of SAE to study drug or other intervention  
The relationship of each SAE to the study intervention should be characterized using one of 
the following terms in accordance with CHOP IRB Guidelines: definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely or unrelated.  
6.3 IRB/IEC Notification of SAEs and Other Unanticipated Problems  
The Investigator will promptly notify the IRB of all on-site unanticipated, serious Adverse 
Events that are related to the research activity. Other unanticipated problems related to the research involving risk to subjects or others will also be reported promptly. Written reports will be filed using the eIRB system and in accordance with the timeline below. External SAEs that are both unexpected and related to the study intervention will be reported promptly after the investigator receives the report. 
Type of Unanticipated 
Problem  Initial Notification  
(Phone, Email, Fax)  Written Report  
Internal (on- site) SAEs  
Death or Life Threatening  24 hours  Within 2 calendar days  
   
30 January 2020  
Internal (on- site) SAEs  
All other SAEs  7 days  Within 7 business days  
Unanticipated Problems 
Related to Research  7 days  Within 7 business days  
All other AEs  N/A Brief Summary of important 
AEs may be reported at time 
of continuing review  
6.3.1 Follow -up report  
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that 
changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow-up report including all relevant new or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed until either resolved or stable.

7 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
7.1 Treatment Assignment Methods 
7.1.1 Randomizations  
One of three arms will be randomly presented to each participant through a specialized 
survey flow. Participants will then be administered one of three arms through a web- based 
randomizer. This data will be recorded and stored in Qualtrics.   
7.1.2 Blinding  
No blinding will be required. 
7.1.3 Unblinding  
N/A 
7.[ADDRESS_863579] obtaining IRB approval or 
determination of exemption. The investigator will obtain a data use agreement between the provider (the PI) of the data and any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including othe rs at CHOP) before 
sharing a limited dataset (PHI limited to dates and zip codes).  
7.[ADDRESS_863580] benefits (other than compensation) to participants. 
   
[ADDRESS_863581] phase of the study will be selected from families already signed up 
for the Research Family Partners program at CHOP.  We are selecting no more than 9 parents from this group to advise us on study design, video development, message effectiveness and targetedness. Meetings will be using teleconferencing software. 
Participants in the second phase will be invited to participate based on a review of the 
scheduled visits to the selected primary care sites each week. We will complete the study procedures in the waiting room or exam room before the visit (depending on the staffing and clinic flow, determined by [CONTACT_645202]), and asking them to meet with us at the conclusion of the visit to complete the study if they are eligible and we were unable to complete the study initially.  We do not anticipate requiring advertising. 
7.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization 
Members of the research team will review the study and obtain informed consent. No 
additional HIPAA authorization is required.  Once a family member has agreed to 
participate, she will be given an iPad that displays a survey that already contains the patient’s research ID.  We will ask screening questions at that time. Parents/guardians who screen as eligible for the study will be invited to continue in the study after the visit.  Surveys will be completed using researcher-provided iPads, and will be completed in the waiting room. Privacy will be assured through the use of headphones during the time the video is playing, and through the use of an iPad to collect the information. 
7.6.1 Screening  
We will complete screening in the clinic waiting room or exam room. The questions will be 
provided as a survey given to parents who are in the clinic and who are willing to be screened.  
7.6.2 Main Study  
A research coordinator (RC) will screen…  
The RC will screen patients while awaiting the start of their visit and then check for their eligibility. Once it is determined that they are interested in participating in the study. We will consent them, review their eligibility, and use Qualtrics randomization tool to assign the participant to one of the three arms.  
No HIPAA authorization form will be needed for this study.

Study Title: Immunotherapy for the treatment of breast canc er related upper extremity lymphede ma 
(BCRL) 
 
Duration: All study participants will be followed for 7 months 
 
Background:  
 
Over the past decad e, improved unde rstanding of the pathologic processes that regulate a 
variety of chronic disorders has made it poss ible to devise targeted treatment options that greatly 
reduce  the morbidity and treatment co sts of these  diseases.  The purpose  of this proposal is to 
develop a similar strategy for patients who suffer from breast canc er related lymphede ma (BCRL) 
using a monoc lonal an tibody targeting the pathological process of this disease. This proposal is a 
direct bench to beds ide translation of NIH funded  research completed in our laboratory elucidating 
the pathological mechan isms of lymphede ma.1-[ADDRESS_449693] cancer treatment developi[INVESTIGATOR_161852] 1 in 3 women who undergo axillary lymph node  dissection.6,7 Lymphede ma also occurs in 
approximately 4-9% of women who unde rgo sentinel lymph node  biopsy8,[ADDRESS_449694] previously shown that CD4+ cells play an important role in the pathology of this 
disease  by [CONTACT_360652].1-[ADDRESS_449695] shown that s imilar to 
other fibroproliferative disorders, differentiation of naive CD4+ cells to the T-Helper 2  (Th2) 
pheno type is necess ary for this pathology. More importantly, we have shown that targeted blockade 
of Th2 differentiation using monoc lonal a ntibodies (mAbs) d irected against interleukin 4 (IL4) and 
interleukin 13 (IL13) markedly decreases the pathological cha nges of lymphede ma in a mouse 
model resulting in significantly dec reased  fibrosis, decreased  adipose  deposition, and improved 
lymphatic function.3   This is important beca use IL4/IL13 blockade using mABs is currently clinically 
used  in phase  I and  phase II studies as an experimental treatment for a variety of fibroproliferative 
disorders including pulmonary fibrosis, keloids, liver fibrosis, kidney  fibrosis, asthma, eos inoph ilic 
esopha gitis, among others. These  once  a month treatments have been  well tolerated in both animal 
and human studies with no major ad verse events reported. Thus, the use mABs for the treatment of 
lymphede ma would be similar to FDA approved treatment options for other chronic disorders such 
as plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. These pharmaceutical treatments are a paradigm shift 
in the treatment of lymphede ma providing a non-compressive and targeted therapeu tic option for

patients who suffer from this disease. If the current trial is successful, our plan would be to proceed 
with multicenter trials for phase  II and III clinical trials. 
 
Study Objectives: Our primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of QBX258 in reduc ing arm 
volume excess in women with stage I-II BCRL. QBX258 is a compound  developed  by [CONTACT_360653] a combination of 2 antibodies that inhibit the bioactivity of IL4 and IL13. 
 
Our secondary  objectives are to analyze tolerability and pharmacokinetics of QBX258, evaluate 
the efficacy of drug therapy in decreasing fluid content and  fibrosis of the affected extremity, 
determine how this treatment cha nges quality of life measures using validated quality of life surveys, 
and to elucidate the histological cha nges in lymphede matous tissues by [CONTACT_360654]. 
 
Patient Population: Women ages 18 to 70 who suffer from unilateral stage I or II BCRL as defined 
by [CONTACT_360655] (spontaneously reversible or irreversible lymphede ma in 
which the tissue  has a spongy consis tency with mild to moderate pi[INVESTIGATOR_360635]) with a minimum volume excess of 300 mL as compared with the normal upper 
extremity. 
 
Study Design: This will be a single arm, open  label p ilot study designed to test the efficacy of 
QBX258, a combination of [ADDRESS_449696].  Patients will then be treated with QBX258 once  every 4 
weeks for 4 treatments followed by [CONTACT_360656] 21 days of the final treatment 
dose.  Washout measurements, based on the known pharmacokinetics of monoc lonal an tibody 
treatment, will be performed 16-20 weeks after the final dose  of QBX258 to analyze chan ges after 
withdrawal of treatment (treatment half life is [ADDRESS_449697] treatment is 
sufficient for complete clearance).  During the course of treatment and  washout  periods, pa tients will 
continue their usual  routine for lymphede ma care including the use of skin care produc ts and 
compression garments according to their pre-treatment directions. However, to avoid potential 
confound ing effects, patients will avoid the use of intermittent pneu matic compression devices, 
manual lymphatic massage by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], laser treatment, or treatment with high 
compression short stretch band ages during the study period.  It is important to note that a lthough 
these  modes  of treatment are used  commonly for lymphede ma, the standard of care for the 
treatment of this disease  is skin care and compression garments.  In fact, a recent review of the 
literature has shown that these  adjunctive treatments have no statistically significant benefit in the 
treatment of lymphed ema in the vast majority of well controlled studies when compared to standard 
therapy.12

lymph node  dissection.7 Although the number of axillary lymph node  dissections performed has 
decreased  with introduc tion of sentinel b iopsy procedures, e ven these  relatively minor injuries to the 
lymphatic system cause  lymphede ma in 4-9% of patients.8,[ADDRESS_449700] cases  disappointing. As a result, treatment is palliative in nature with the hope  of 
preventing disease  progression rather than achieving a cure.  Patients are required to constantly 
wear tight fitting, uncomfortable compression garments designed to prevent fluid accumulation. 
Physical therapy treatments are also performed in some cases  and a re time intensive (4-6 week 
treatment course for an hour a day and 24/7 wrappi[INVESTIGATOR_360636]) a nd expens ive (more than 
$10,000/year by [CONTACT_360658]).[ADDRESS_449701] cases  occurs in a delayed fashion, usually 1-5 years after 
surgery.19    Thus, a lthough lymphatic injury is clearly the initiating event, the pathologic events that 
follow and lead to the development of lymphede ma in a subset of patients remain unknown. This 
gap in our knowledge serves as a significant barrier to the development of targeted, rational 
treatment methods for this disabling and common disorder.

Amended: [ADDRESS_449702] shown 
that fibrosis is a key pathologic process  and may serve as a “second  hit” following lymphatic injury 
ultimately leading to the development of lymphede ma.1,2,4,[ADDRESS_449703] 
that fibrosis is a hallmark of lymphede ma clinically and progression of disease is characterized by 
[CONTACT_360659].21 In addition, it is well recognized that fibrosis is a 
common cause  of end-organ failure in a number of other organ systems including liver, lung, skin, 
kidney, and heart suggesting that lymphede ma may simply represent “end-organ failure” of the 
lymphatic system due  to fibrosis.22    Fibrosis also provides a rationale for the delayed development 
of lymphede ma since the progressive abno rmal collagen depos ition necessary to cause  organ 
dysfunction takes time to accumulate. This hypothesis is also supp orted by [CONTACT_360660] a 
variety of mouse  models.1-5,20,23 
 
 
Lymphedema  results in chron ic CD4+ cell inflamma tion.  Based  on our hypothesis that 
lymphede ma is fibrosis related end-organ failure of the lymphatic system, our lab has spent the last 
[ADDRESS_449704] shown that the majority of inflammatory cells that are present in lymphede matous tissues  are 
CD4+ cells and that the severity of lymphede ma positively clinically correlates with the degree of 
CD4+ cell inflammation.[ADDRESS_449705] shown that similar to other fibrotic disorders, CD4+ 
cells present in lymphedematous tissue have a mixed T-helper 1  (Th1), T-helper 2 (Th2) 
pheno type.2,[ADDRESS_449706] shown that Th2 cells produce 
profibrotic cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL4), interleukin 13 (IL13), and transforming growth factor 
beta 1 (TGF-B1). These  molecules activate a diverse array of pathways that increase collagen 
synthesis, decrease  matrix turnover and remodeling thus resulting in replacement of functional 
parench yma with scar.22 
 
 
CD4+ cell inflammation and differen tiation to Th2 pheno type plays a key role in the pathology 
of lymphedema.  We have shown that depletion of CD4+ ce lls with neutralizing antibodies or loss of 
CD4+ cells in CD4 knockout mice prevents development of lymphede ma in our mouse model.5,[ADDRESS_449707] compared tissue biopsy samples before and 6 
months after lymphatic by[CONTACT_4897] (a treatment that dec reases lymphatic fluid stasis) and  have 
found  that su bjective and objective improvements with these  surgical treatments correlate with 
decreased  CD4+ ce ll inflammation, dec reased fibrosis, and  decreased  hyperkeratosis (a clinical 
hallmark of lymphede ma).24

IRB#: 15-085 A(4) 
Amended: [ADDRESS_449708] that the pathology of 
lymphede ma is related to chronic CD4+ cell inflammation, d ifferentiation to Th2 phen otype, and 
tissue  fibrosis. Therefore, the use of antifibrotic treatments represents a novel and  targeted 
treatment of this common and morbid complication of cancer  treatment. This parad igm shift in the 
treatment of lymphed ema provides numerous applications and novel treatment s trategies for a 
disease  that has previously been  primarily treated with dubious preventative measu res and palliative 
treatment options. 
 
 
Th2 responses  are involved in other fibropr oliferative disorders.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_360637], the mechanisms that regulate fibrosis in a variety of organ systems 
including the lung, liver, kidney, and skin are largely conse rved and dependent  in large part on Th2 
cytokines. The aggregate of a large number of studies has led to the proposal of the Th2 paradigm 
hypothesis by [CONTACT_360661]2 responses, as  we have obse rved in 
lymphede ma, are a major pathologic response  in fibroproliferative disorders.22,[ADDRESS_449709] IL4 or IL13 (or 
both) since the use of targeted immunotherapy h as been  highly succes sful in a variety of diseases 
including breast cancer  (herceptin), melanoma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, among others. 
Therefore, based  on this rationale in this protocol we propose  to use a monoclonal IL4/IL13 
neutralizing antibody  for the treatment of lymphedema. 
 
 
Blockade  of Th2 responses  is onco logically safe. T cell resposes  in gene ral, and Th2 
differentiation in particular are known regulators of breast cancer tumorigenesis.26,[ADDRESS_449710] shown that activation of IL4/IL13 signaling pathways increases breast cancer invasion 
and propens ity for lung metastasis.[ADDRESS_449711] shown that blockade of IL4 
and IL13 with neutralizing antibodies (similar to the approach proposed in this application) inhibit 
tumor growth and metastasis in a variety of tumor types including breast c ancer.26,[ADDRESS_449712] cancer  development, growth, or metastasis, there 
has been  no evidence  of carcinogenic potential for QBX258 or its component antibodies in long-term 
repeat dose  toxicity or preclinical primate studies (performed up to 6 months in duration).   These 
facts together lead us to conclude that the use of QBX258 and resultant IL4/IL13 blockade in breast 
cancer su rvivors is onco logically safe.

Amended: [ADDRESS_449713] shown that arm volume measurements over short periods of 
time (as long as 1 year) remain relatively stable unless the patient experiences  an acute 
exacerbation resulting from an infection or ce llulitis.  For example, Shaw and colleagues in a study 
on the effect of weight loss on BCRL found  very little spontaneous  changes in limb volumes in 
patients relegated to the control (i.e. no weight loss) group.[ADDRESS_449714] also shown that 
conse rvative measu res that patients use such as compression garments or self massage also do 
not spontaneous ly decrease arm volumes; rather, these  approaches are designed to prevent

test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.997) of perometer measurements37,[ADDRESS_449716] that cha nges in arm volume measurements will be a sensitive primary outcome 
measu re to analyze therapeu tic interventions for BCRL.  In addition, based  on a comprehensive 
review of the literature on previous studies reporting positive outcomes in lymphede ma treatment 
using various treatment modalities (e.g. laser, pneumatic pump devices), we have found  that 
reductions in arm volumes of 20-30% after treatment are considered to be a 
clinically significant endpoint.35,39-49    Based  on this analysis, we conclude that novel treatments such 
as Th2 blockade as proposed  in this trial would be clinically relevant if they can decrease  arm 
volumes by 20-30%.

and Western countries. Based  on our inclusion and exclusion criteria (see below) women  with 
stage I or II BCR L with a minimum  volume excess of [ADDRESS_449721] 6 months postop from 
axillary lymph node  dissection will be recru ited for treatment with QBX258 a monoc lonal 
IL4/IL13 neutralizing antibody  for once  every 4 weeks  for 4 treatments.  Objective/subjective 
measu res of treatment as well as the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of treatment will be 
evaluated. 
 
Prima ry objective: 
 
 
 
1) Arm volume calculations. These  measurements will be performed using a perometer 
(Volumerter; Bosl Medizintechn ick, Aschen  [LOCATION_013]), a non-invasive infra red scanner that 
reproduc ibly measu res the diameter of the extremity at multiple points and calculates arm volumes 
using the truncated cone  formula. The perometer has  been  shown to have excellent 
intrarater/interrater and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.997) with a greater 
than 95% specificity for lymphede ma.37,38   Analysis of arm volume is considered the “gold-standard” 
for measurement of fluid and adipose  accumulation in patients with lymphede ma and is used  in most 
lymphede ma studies to evaluate response  to treatment.  Duplicate measurements will be performed 
at base line following enrollment (0-2 weeks prior to initiation of treatment).  Measu rements will be 
performed between the hours of 8AM and 5PM and will be performed by a licensed  physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_360639] .   Volume excess will be calculated as compared with the normal upper 
extremity.  Duplicate arm volumes will be re-measured within [ADDRESS_449722] dose  of QBX258.

Secon dary objectives: 
 
 
1) Bioimpedance  meas uremen ts will be performed using the ImpediMed L-DexTM U400 
device.  This device is FDA app roved for measu rement of tissue dielectric constant and  calculates 
the fluid content of tissues using differential transmission of low voltage electrical current.50 
Bioimpedance  has very high sensitivity (100%)  and specificity (98%) for lymphede ma as compared 
with limb volume measu rements.[ADDRESS_449723] been shown to be highly sensitive for detecting changes in fluid content in 
patients with stage I and II lymphede ma.50   Bioimpedance  measurements will be performed at the 
same sessions as the volumetric analysis. 
 
2) Skin fibrosis/elasticity will be assessed  using a non-invasive device (Elastimeter; Delfin 
Techno logies).   Skin tonometry measurements are a sensitive means  of analyzing response  to 
treatment and progression of disease  in patients with lymphede ma.40,[ADDRESS_449724] very 
high reliability.53   The Elastimeter is a battery operated device that measures the force required to 
indent  the skin at a given location. The inden tation that is measured is minor and monitored with 
built in force sensors that measure skin elasticity based  on a low level deformation force that 
enab les instantaneo us measu rements. There is no change in skin structure and the force is applied 
for less than 3 second s. Skin fibrosis/elasticity measurements will be performed at the same 
sessions as the volumetric analysis. 
 
3) Quality of life survey (ULL 27) will be administered at the same sessions as volumetric 
analysis.  The ULL27  is validated for patients with lymphede ma, is simple to complete, and  enab les 
us to track patient reported outcomes of lymphede ma.54,55 The scale is highly precise, accurate, and 
sens itive to changes in symptoms. The ULL 27 is comprised of 27 items divided into three 
dimensions: ‘physical’ (15 items), ‘psychological’ (seven items) and ‘social’ (five items). The recall 
period is short (previous 4 weeks) enabling us to compare pre and post treatment quality of life 
measures. In addition, the ULL27 has been shown to have a high degree of sensitivity for quantifying 
clinical improvements in lymphedema symptoms. The questionna ire and scoring methods are 
appe nded to this protocol. 
 
4) Histologic outcome s. Histologic analysis of tissue changes after targeted therapy is an 
important part of this proposal as  it will enab le us to perform mechan istic analysis of response  to 
Th2 blockade. We have performed this analysis previously on nearly [ADDRESS_449725] 
shown that the biopsy procedu re is safe (no adverse effects including infections or wound  healing 
complications in any of the patients), simple to perform in an outpatient setting, and  extremely well

analysis in [ADDRESS_449726] treatment biopsy proced ures will not be optional.

surgery outpatient office. We will use  the protocol that we have previously used  in our co llaborations 
with Stanford University, MD Anderson, and  University of Chicago.2,3,24,56,57  Briefly, patients will be 
treated with a dose  of antibiotics (Keflex 500mg or clindamycin 900mg PO if allergic to PCN) [ADDRESS_449729] wound  care instructions will be provided. 
The patient will be seen  in followup 3-21 days to assess  proper wound  healing. 
 
5) Tolerab ility of treatment. In general, treatment with QBX258 as well as its individual 
component pa rts (VAK694 and QAX576)  in both preclinical and  clinical studies have been  well 
tolerated (see section 11 Toxicology).  There have been  no serious adverse effects directly related 
to either QBX258 or its component  monoc lonal antibodies.  In addition, minor to moderate adverse 
effects have all resolved spon taneous ly without long-term sequelae.  An objective of this study will 
be to continue these observations and report SAEs or AEs if they were to develop. 
 
6) Pharmakok inetics (PK) of QBX258. A number of clinical and  primate animal studies have 
evaluated the PK of QBX258 compone nt parts (VAK694 and QAX576). In addition, the PK of 
QBX258 has been  analyzed in one clinical study as well as long term primate animal studies. 
Therefore, a seconda ry aim of this study is to analyze the PK of QBX258 treatment. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/D IAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
 
• QBX258 is the combination of two antibodies (VAK694 and QAX576) developed  by [CONTACT_360662]4 and IL13. VAK694 is a fully human monoc lonal IgG1k 
antibody  (mAb) with a specificity and high affinity for IL4 (KD= 7pM). QAX576 is a fully 
human IgG1k mAB directed against IL13 (KD = 139pM).   The drug (QBX258) as well as 
drug administration equipment (e.g. pumps, tubing) and  pharmacy instructions will all be 
supp lied by [CONTACT_5343]. 
• QBX258 as a combined injection of QAX576 and VAK694 is administered IV and  has been 
tested in rhesus monkeys, marmoset monkeys, and humans. 
• The Investigational New Drug Application (IND) has been  submitted by [CONTACT_360663] (IND #107 ,646).  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer 
Center will cross reference this IND held by [CONTACT_360664].

Dose Calculation 
 
The doses  of the combination antibody  components of QBX258 to be used in the current study are 
based  on previous/ongoing clinical trials with VAK694 (3mg/kg) and QAX576 (6mg/kg). 
 
In a clinical study of QBX258, sequential i.v. doses of VAK69 4 (3 mg/kg) and QAX576 (0, 0.3, 1, 
3 and 6 mg/kg, 1 hour after VAK694 ) were administered on a single occasion. As expected for 
IgG1 type antibodies, the mean systemic  clearances for VAK69 4 and QAX576 were low (4.1 
mL/day/kg and 3.0 mL/day/kg, respectively). The systemic clearance for VAK69 4 was not 
modified  upon  QAX576 administration, and that for QAX576 was consistent with values observed 
in studies where QAX576 was administered alone. The mean terminal phase half-life for VAK6 94 
was 23.1 days and not  significantly affected upon QAX576 administration. The mean half-life for 
QAX576 was also  as expected (22.8 days) and in the range of values previously observed when 
QAX576 was administered alone. Given in combination on one occasion, VAK694 and QAX576 
demonstrated  typi[INVESTIGATOR_226798]1 type kinetics and very similar profiles as compare to when given alone. 
Because they also demonstrated linear PK behaviour, no pharmacokinetic interactions are 
expected as well when these two entities will be administered together on multiple occas ions. 
 
Both VAK69 4 (3mg/kg) and QAX576 (6mg/kg) in the doses chosen for the current study have been 
generally safe and well tolerated in other clinic al trials for treatment periods up to [ADDRESS_449730] been 
suspec ted to be related to QAX576 include a possible drug interaction with acetaminophen and 
an occurrence of  Ramsay-Hunt syndrome. There were no adverse event with an expected causal 
relationship  and no fatal adverse events with a suspected causal relationship. No significant 
immunogenicity has been observed. 
 
Prepara tion and pack aging

Amended: [ADDRESS_449734] Medicine, and rehab ilitation medicine services.  If the treating physician is 
also an investigator on  the protocol, then s/he will discuss  the study with the patient. Otherwise the 
patient will be referred to a study investigator for evaluation. It is estimated that more that 30% of 
women who unde rgo axillary lymph node  dissection for the treatment of breast cancer go on to 
develop lymphede ma.  Because  these procedu res are performed commonly (approximately 
150/year desp ite the widespread use of sentinel lymph node  biopsy) a large number of patients go 
on to develop lymphede ma. In addition, beca use lymphede ma is a lifelong cond ition and our 
treatments for breast ca ncer have increased  survival, a large number of breast cancer su rvivors 
suffer from lymphed ema thus providing a large pool of patients who are eligible for the trial. 
Therefore, pa tients will be identified as they present to the individual se rvices. To increase 
awareness  of the trial, the clinical trial will also be listed on clinicaltrials.gov.  Because  breast cancer 
is most commonly diagnosed  in women, we will focus  our recruitment efforts to women. 
 
 
During the initial asses sment, the patient may be asked to provide certain health information 
that is necess ary for the recruitment and  enrollment proces s.  Specifically, the diagnosis, current 
treatments, stability, and symptoms of lymphede ma will be queried. In addition, the patient will be 
asked about  the current status of their disease, history of lymphede ma related infections, h istory of 
fibroproliferative disorders (e.g. pulmonary fibrosis, cirrhosis, keloids), history of axillary surgery, and 
the current treatment p lan for their lymphede ma. The investigator/resea rch staff may also review 
portions of her medical records at MSKCC in order to further assess  eligibility. They will use  the 
information provided by [CONTACT_5363] /or medical record to confirm that the patient is eligible and to 
contact [CONTACT_108541]. If the patient is ineligible for the research study, the 
resea rch staff will des troy all information collected on the patient during the initial con versation and 
medical records review, except for any  information that must be maintained for screening log 
purposes. If the woman agrees to study participation, a conse nting individual (listed below in section

8.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATION 
 
The pretreatment evaluation will aim to quantify the objective and subjective chan ges of 
lymphede ma. This analysis will include: 
 
1)  Physical Examination will be performed to evaluate lymphadenopa thy, evidence  of cancer 
recurrence, and  general physical hea lth.  This will include vital signs as well as height/weight 
measu rements. 
 
2)  Urine Pregnancy  test will be administered prior to enrollment into the study and prior to each 
monthly drug treatment. Although QBX258 treatment has not e xhibited evidence  of maternal toxicity 
in multiple preclinical trials with marmoset monkeys, there was a trend towards an increased  rate of 
spon taneous  abortions in these  studies.  However, fetuses that were born to monkeys treated with 
QBX258 had normal fetal developmental pa rameters and there was no evidence  of teratogenicity. 
Therefore, pa tients capable of childbea ring recruited to the study will be required to use highly 
effective birth control measures whilst participating in the QBX258 t r ia l and for at least 18 weeks ( 
5 half-lives) after the last dose of QBX258. 
 
3)  Arm volume meas urements will be performed in duplicate at base line using a perometer (Pero- 
Systems).   Measu rements will be performed by a licensed  physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_360640] 53rd and Madison Avenue  between the hours of 8AM and 3PM. 
The perometer is a non-invasive infrared scanner that measu res the circumference  of the upper 
extremity at multiple points.  Volumes are then calculated using the truncated cone  formula. This 
analysis is highly reproducible and accurate avoiding the need  for traditional volume measurements 
(fluid displacement) or manual limb circumference  measurements.  Volume excess will be calculated 
as compared with the normal (i.e. co ntralateral) upper extremity. 
 
4)  Bioimpedance  meas uremen ts will be performed to compare the no rmal and lymphede matous limbs 
using the ImpediMed L-DexTM U400 device. The ImpediMed device is FDA approved and is used  to 
estimate the fluid content of tissues  based  on resistance  to transmission of electrical current. These  
measurements are simple to perform and  are highly accurate in analyzing chan ges in early stage 
lymphede ma. Bioimpedance measurements will be performed in duplicate at the same time as 
volume measu rements.

5)  Skin fibrosis will be assessed  at the same session as arm volume measurement using a tonometer  
 (Elastimeter; Delfin Techonolgies).  Duplicate measures of a point located 10 cm above and 10 cm 
below the olecranon  process on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the limb will be recorded.  Skin 
fibrosis resulting from hyperkeratosis and fibrosis is a characteristic feature of lymphede ma. 
 
6)  Quality of life survey (ULL27 ) will be administered upon  enrollment to quan tify the subjective 
measu res of lymphede ma. These questionna ires are validated lymphede ma specific surveys and 
are simple to perform and have been  used  in previous lymphede ma trials performed at MSKCC. 
The questionna ires will be administered within 6 weeks enrollment and prior to the start of therapy. 
 
 
 
7)  Histologic analysis.  A defining feature of lymphede ma is skin fibrosis and inflammation. We have 
previously compared skin biopsy specimens from the normal and  lymphede matous limbs of patients 
to analyze inflammatory changes and, more recently, to evaluate tissue changes that occur after 
lymphede ma surgery. These  biopsies have been  performed in over [ADDRESS_449737]-treatment biopsies to analyze 
treatment efficacy for decreasing inflammation and fibrosis using our previously published protocols. 
Skin biopsies (both normal and  lymphede matous arms) will be performed before and after treatment. 
 
Histologic analysis of biopsy specimens will be performed using our previoulsy published 
reports to analyze inflammation and tissue fibrosis.1-5,20,57 Briefly, CD4+ and  Th2 cells will be 
identified and quantified using immunoh istochemical staining according to our previously published 
protocols.3   In addition, we will ana lyze the degree of tissue fibrosis using collagen staining and 
analysis of Sirius Red Birifringence (scar index) according to our previously published  methods.  It is 
important to note that in our previous studies we have shown that the severity of lymphed ema 
clinically is positively correlated with the number of CD4+ ce lls, the number of Th2 cells, and  the 
degree of tissue fibrosis. In addition, in other c linical studies comparing pre and postoperative tissue 
biopsy samples in patients who unde rwent lymphovenous  by[CONTACT_360667] (a surgical treatment 
that a ims to by[CONTACT_360668]) we have found that 
the severity of CD4+ ce ll inflammation and fibrosis decreased  signficantly after surgery and that this 
response  correlarted with symptomatic improvement.24 
 
 
8)  Routine Blood draw. A pretreatment complete blood count  and differential will be performed within 
one month of starting the trial to establish base line values for co mplete blood coun t, basic metabolic 
pane l, and liver enzymes. 
 
9)  Research  Blood draw. A pretreatment PK ana lysis measurement blood draw will be performed.

Pharmacokinetics 
In order to calculate the pharmacokinetics of both component antibodies of QBX258, blood 
draws will be performed from study subjects according to the following schedule: 
Initial day of dosing: Blood draw will be performed within 30 minutes after the conclusion of infusion + 
5 minutes 
Day 15 (+3 days) after 1st dose 
Days 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, and 141 (+ 3 days) after 1st dose;  Day [ADDRESS_449740] dose (+ 10 
days) 
Blood samples will be taken either by  [CONTACT_360670] (i.e. non-lymphede matous) hand  or forearm vein.  At the specified time points, 4ml of 
blood will be collected in tubes  with EDTA as an anticoagulant to obtain [ADDRESS_449741] 0 .3ml 
of plasma.  All samples will be given a unique sample number and  a collection number (de-identified 
of all patient information). The actual sample collection date and time will be entered on the PK 
blood collection page. Samples will be kept up right at -70 degrees celcius on site and sent in batch 
shipments as necessa ry to AtlanBio for ana lysis (Z.I. de Brais - 1 rue Graham Bell, [ZIP_CODE]  Saint 
Nazaire; [LOCATION_009]). The plan for PK blood collection is summarized in the diagram be low. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Evaluation of acute infusion reaction and tolerability of QAX258. 
 
The risk of anaph ylaxis or  anaphylactoid reactions is present but is minimized due to fact 
that QAX576 and VAK694 are fully human monoclonal antibodies. Anaphylactic reactions are much 
less common to human mAbs than mouse, chimeric or humanized mAbs.58

Although very rare, if these reactions occur, they usually do so after the first or any 
subsequent intravenous administration of the drug. Therefore, vital signs will be assessed  after 
initiation of infusion and repea ted every hour  after infusion for a total of [ADDRESS_449742] information (person calling and patient reports) will be 
recorded in a log created for each  patient at the onset  of the study.   The log will be kept on a 
secu re server.  Patients will be instructed to call or contact [CONTACT_360671].  In addition, patients will be queried about  these  symptoms prior to initiation of 2nd, 
3rd, and 4th  infusions.  The patient specific log will be upda ted at these time points by [CONTACT_360672].  This plan is based on the experience with other FDA monoclonal antibody treatments (e.g. 
Remicade®) .  Patients who report symptoms or potential adverse effects will be evaluated in 
person and poss ible relationsh ip to the study will be assesse d. 
 
 
Examination of biop sy sites and wound healing 
 
Biopsy  sites in both the lymphede matous and normal limbs will be asses sed by a conse nting 
physician or licensed  practitioner [ADDRESS_449743] 
 
Given the potential reproductive toxicity of Th2 blockade (see section below on toxicity), a 
urine pregnancy  test will be administered to volunteers of childbea ring age upon  enrollment and 
before each  infusion. 
 
Outcome measures of lymphedema treatment 
 
Outcome measures of lymphede ma will be assessed  as outlined above and include limb 
volume measu rements, bioimpedance,  skin fibrosis/elasticity, QOL surveys, and histologic analysis. 
Volumetric analysis, bioimpedance, skin fibrosis/elasticity, and QOL surveys will be assessed  within 
[ADDRESS_449744] dose  of QBX258 and after a washout  period of 16-20 weeks.  In addition, the 
patients weight will be checked at each  time point.

Definition of an  Adverse  event:  Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment 
or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure 
(attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). [CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse 
Event Reporting Requirements. January 2005 ;http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html]) 
 
 
Definition of an SAE: Any adverse experience occurring during any part of protocol treatment and 
30 days after that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 
 
• Death; 
• A life-threatening adverse drug experience; 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 
 
Important   medical   events   that   may  not   result   in   death,   be   life  threatening,  or   require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_360641], when, based upon medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient and may require medical or  surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes  listed  in  the  definition.  Any  pregnancy  occurring  on  study  will  be  reported as a 
medically significant event. 
 
 
All AEs and  SAEs will be repor ted to the IRB and sponsor ing institution as ou tlined in

Potential toxicity related to QB X258 treatment in pr eviously conducted trials: QBX258 
has been sho wn to be well tolerated in both preclinical studies and hu man trials. In animal studies 
using Rhesus  monkeys treated with escalating doses  of QBX258 up to a dose  of 100mg/kg, there 
were  no   QBX258  treatment-related  deaths.  There  were  no  QBX258-related  clinical  signs  or 
changes in  bodyweight, food consumption, ophthalmic examinations, ECG, heart rate or blood 
pressure.  There  were  no  effects  on  clinical  pathology,  hematology,  clinical   chemistry   and 
urinalysis investigations. There were no effects either on peripheral b lood lymphocyte 
immunopheno typi[INVESTIGATOR_360642] (generation of a primary  and secondary T 
cell-dependent IgM and IgG antibody  response to KLH). There were no effects on organ weight 
or in macroscopic or microscopic observations, including no effects  on extended histopathology 
of lymphoid organs. 
Similarly, in the first study of QBX258 in humans, sequential intravenous  doses  of VAK694 
(3mg/kg) and  QAX256 (up to 6mg/kg) on a single occas ional were safe and well tolerated. In a 
different study of [ADDRESS_449746] other ad verse events (e,g. headache, e tc) were mild 
or moderate and resolved spon taneo usly. 
 
The  potential  on -target  risk  of  QBX258  is  further  mitigated  by  [CONTACT_360673]-[ADDRESS_449747] been  reported to be well tolerated without significant 
adverse events. 
 
Potential  toxicity  related  to  individual  compon ents  of  QBX258  (VAK694  and 
QAX576 ). Because  QBX258 is a combination of 2 sepa rate monoc lonal an tibodies (VAK694 and 
QAX576), the known toxicity of these individual compone nts and the combination drug are listed 
below. 
 
VAK694 has been  well tolerated when administered to human subjects in doses  ranging from a 
single infusion of 0.1mg/kg to healthy individuals to four sequential infusions of 3mg/kg given every 
[ADDRESS_449748] resolved spon taneous ly.  No significant 
immunogenicity has been obse rved. 
• Doses  as high as 100mg/kg/dose  (more than 30 times the dose administered in humans) 
administered once  weekly for 4 weeks in cynommolgus monkeys were well tolerated with

Potential comp lications related to biop sy 
 
Biopsy  of lymphed ematous and normal arms are an important aspe ct of this application as 
these  procedu res will enable us to determine if Th2  blockade is succes sful in reversing the 
pathologic tissue changes assoc iated with lymphede ma. In addition, these  studies are critical for 
performing mechan istic studies that may further our studies and unde rstanding of lymphede ma. We 
have performed these  procedu res in over [ADDRESS_449756] 
similar results in the current proposa l. If adverse effects (i.e. delayed healing, infection, lymph leak 
etc) are identified, then these  will be reported immediately to the principal investigators and the IRB 
and appropriate treatments including antibiotic treatment (PO or IV depe nding on severity of 
infection), debridement, and further management will be instituted as necessary. 
 
Potential toxicity or complications related to measureme nts 
 
Measu rements performed in this study (perometry, bioimpedance, tonometry) are all non- 
invasive and we do not expect to experience  any AEs.  Similarly, the patient reported outcome 
questionna ires administered in this study have been  validated and used  in hund reds of patients 
without any significant adverse events. 
 
 
 
 
12.0 CRIT ERIA FOR TH ERAPEUTIC R ESPONSE/OUTCO ME ASSES SMENT 
 
Patients will be considered evaluable if they provide both a base line and follow-up arm 
volume measu rements.   If biopsy data or time points from PK ana lysis measurement are not 
available at followup due to patient des ire to avoid additional su rgery or a missed  blood draw 
appo intment, then the remainder of the outcomes will be analyzed.  Similarly, if impeda nce, 
tonometry, or QOL data are not available, then other measu res available will be analyzed. 
Therapeu tic volume changes in the arm will be calculated using the methods published  by [CONTACT_360674] (2000 ).65   Briefly, the difference  in volume measu rments between the normal and 
lymphede matous arms at base line (i.e volume excess) will be compared to the volume differential 
after drug treatment and following the washout  period using the following formula:

13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients will be removed from the study according to the following criteria: 
 
• Significant toxicity, persistent AE or SAE related or unrelated to the treatment. 
• If at any  time the patient is diagnosed  or de velops recurrent breast canc er or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_360647] y. 
• Subject non -compliance  with infusions, measurements/analysis at the appropriate time 
intervals. 
• Voluntary wish of the subject to withdraw from the protocol. 
• Development of cellulitis or infection of the affected extremity. 
• Significant progression of lymphede ma volume changes during treatment (greater than 30% 
increase  in limb volume as assessed  by [CONTACT_360675]). 
• Unexpected pregnancy  or non-compliance  with the use of birth control methods 
 
The study will be halted in the event of a grade 3 or 4 SAE until investigation of causa lity with 
drug treatment is concluded. At this point if the SAE is not thought to be caused  by [CONTACT_360676], 
then the treatment plan will be reviewed with the company  and the IRB to decide if the study shou ld 
be restarted. 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This is a prospe ctive, longitudinal, open  label p ilot study designed to evaluate the efficacy of 
QBX258, a monoc lonal antibody  treatment designed to block biologic activity of interleukin 4 (IL4) 
and interleukin 13 (IL13).  Our primary end point is volume changes as measured by [CONTACT_360675]. 
Our second ary endpo ints include pharmacokinetics, bioimpeda nce measurements, skin tonometry, 
the ULL27  lymphed ema questionna ire, and  histologic studies. 
 
Sample size calculation:  Based  on a review of the literature, reductions of 20-40% in the extent of 
excess lymphede ma volume before and after various interventions such as weight loss or co ld laser 
have been  reported. 35,39-[ADDRESS_449757] not gained widesp read clinical 
incorporation due to compliance  issues  (weight loss) and time intensive nature of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
However, it is commonly accep ted that a 30% reduction to any potential therapy for lymphede ma is 
a good clinical response  and worthy of additional study. We will therefore consider an average 
decrease  of 30% in arm volume excess in the cohort as a therapeu tic response.  Previous studies 
have also shown that the minimum measurable change in volume is 60-[ADDRESS_449758] used  a minimum volume excess of 300 cc  between the normal and 
lymphede matous arms as an inclusion criterion measu rable. Thus, a excess volume reduction in a 
patient who has a volume excess of 300 cc prior to treatment would be equal to a 90cc reduc tion, 
which is greater than the minimal measurable change of 60-75cc (). 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER 
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 15-085 A(4) 
Amended: [ADDRESS_449759] a  30% reduction in excess volume (236ml difference between pre and post treatment) with 
90% power and 5% type I error.  Assuming a 10% drop out rate, we will therefore plan on accruing 
[ADDRESS_449760] to accrue approximately two patients per month and will complete accrual within one 
year. 
 
Analysis of primary  objective:  Our primary aim is to establish the difference in the extent of 
excess lymphede ma volume before and after treatment with QBX258. The extent of excess 
lymphede ma volume is defined as the difference  between the volume of the lymphede matous arm 
and the normal arm at each time point (i.e. Prior to treatment; after treatment, and  after washou t). 
Since the volume measurement at each  time point is taken in duplicate, the average between the 
duplicate measurements will be used  to calculate the excess lymphede ma volume; see section 
12.0). The difference in the extent of lymphed ema between time points will be assessed  with paired 
two-sided t-tests comparing the post-treatment and washout  measurements with the pre-treatment 
measu rements and the post-treatment measurements with the washout measu rements.  In addition, 
we will ana lyze the effect of potential confound ing variables such as pre treatment BMI on volume 
reduc tion using analysis of covariance  (ANCOVA) with the arm volume difference  after completion of 
treatment as the outcome variable and base line volume difference  and BMI as covariates. We will 
report a two-tailed p-value and a 95% confidence  interval for the difference  between groups. Data 
will be presen ted graphically to facilitate analysis. 
 
Analysis of secondary  objectives: 
 
Tolerability will be evaluated using toxicity data and will be tabulated by [CONTACT_926].  ULL-27 
questionna ire responses  will be graded  and scored according to previously published methods  (see 
Append ix A).   Changes in each  symptom sca le (physical, psychological and  socia l) as well as the 
overall score will be compared pre and postn treatment using paired two-sided t-tests. The 
bioimpedance  and tonometry measurements yield continuous  variables and will be analyzed using 
paired t-tests.  Similarly, histologic analysis of the biopsy specimens will yield data on the number of 
CD4+ cells, the number of Th2 cells, and the degree of tissue fibrosis, all of which are also 
continuous  variables. These variables will be compared pre and post treatment us ing paired t-tests. 
For phamacokinetic analysis, mean volume of distribution at steady  state (Vss),mean total systemic 
clearancea nd the mean distribution half-life (t1/2α) will be calculated using published methods.

16.1 Quality Assurance  
 
Registration reports will be generated to monitor patient accruals and completeness  of 
registration data.  Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess  missing data and 
incons istencies.  Accrual rates and extent and  accuracy of evaluations and follow-up will be 
monitored periodically throughout the study and potential problems will be brought to the 
attention of the study team for discuss ion and action. 
 
 
Rando m-Sample data quality and protocol compliance  audits will be conducted by [CONTACT_123894], at a minimum of two times per year and more frequently if indicated. 
 
 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
Center were approved by [CONTACT_360678] 2001. The plans 
address the new policies set forth by [CONTACT_128250] "Policy of the 
National Cancer Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials" which can be 
found  at: http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm. 
 
 
Clinical trials are monitored by a number of different mechan isms to ensue  data 
safety and quality.  Institutional p rocess es are in place for quality assurance (e.g. protocol 
monitoring, compliance  and data verification audits, therapeutic response s, and staff 
educa tion on clinical research).  In addition, there are depa rtmental procedures for quality 
control as well as two institutional c ommittees that are respons ible for monitoring the 
activities of our clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) for Phase  I and  II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) for Phase  III clinical trials, report to the Center’s Research Counc il and 
Institutional Review Board. 
 
 
During the protocol de velopment and  review process, each protocol will be assessed  for 
it’s level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH 
sponso red, in-house  sponsored, indus trial spons ored, NCI coop erative group, etc.) will 
be addressed  and the monitoring procedu res will be established  at the time of protocol 
activation. 
 
 
17.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Prior to the enrollment of each  patient, the risks, benefits and objectives of the study will be 
reviewed with the participant, including a discuss ion of the possible toxicities and side effects. 
Financ ial cos ts and burdens of the trial will be reviewed in detail including a detailed discuss ion of 
the tests/measu rements that will be performed.  The tests and measu rements will be the financial 
respons ibility of the study.  The cost of traveling to and from the center for evaluation will be the 
financ ial respons ibility of the patient.  Blood work analysis as well as analysis of EKG and  other 
monitoring tests will be provided at no cost to the patient.  Every effort will be made to keep study 
records private.

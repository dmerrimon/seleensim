Version 9/3/[ADDRESS_859466] Summary  
 
Insomnia, defined as a subjective report of difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, 
and/or non -restorat ive sleep, leads to significant daytime dysfunction and increased health risks. 
A commonly held hypothesis is that insomnia is caused by a state of hyperarousal, but the 
neurobiological mechanisms of hyperarousal in insomnia are poorly understood, in part because 
of limitations in our ability to image the brain during normal human sleep with sufficient 
temporal resolution. Insomnia is particularly prevalent among depressed individuals, yet little is 
known about whether this same state of hyperarousal is pre sent in comorbid depression and 
insomnia. Furthermore, the efficacy of insomnia treatment is judged by [CONTACT_642132]/or sleep amount which are generally 
small in magnitude; there are curr ently no data to demonstrate that insomnia treatments correct 
any functional abnormalities in the sleep process that likely contribute to neurobehavioral 
abnormalities and health risks. The goals of the proposed study are to use hdEEG to define 
abnormaliti es in specific aspects of sleep in insomnia patients with and without depression 
compared to healthy sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_642098] a ssess treatments 
for insomnia.  
 
2. Background and Significance  
 
2.[ADDRESS_859467] common sleep disorder (Ohayon 2002) , with at least 10% of the 
general population suffering from chronic insomnia severe enough to impact adversely on health 
and quality of life (Benca 2005, Roth et al 2001) . When combined, the high prevalence rate, 
daytim e impairments, and other adverse effects of insomnia on the outcomes of comorbid 
psychiatric or medical conditions push estimates of the direct and indirect costs of chronic 
insomnia up to tens of billions of dollars annually (NIH 2005) .  There is mounting evidence that 
insomnia contributes to increased risk for development of hypertension  and diabetes  (Vgontzas 
et al 2013) , heart failure and overall mortality  (Laugsand et al 2013) , and mood disorders 
(Baglioni et al 2011, Suh et al 2013) .  Currently, insomnia is a clinical diagnosis based on 
subjective complaints about quantity and/or quality of sleep that result in daytime impairment. 
Symptoms include difficulty initiating sl eep, difficulty maintaining sleep, waking up too early, 
and sleep that is often described as “non -refreshing” or “non -restorative”. The pathophysiology 
of insomnia is poorly understood and there are no objective diagnostic measures currently in 
existence. The evaluation of treatment options, including behavioral therapy and 
pharmacotherapy, also suffers from the lack of an objective measure of sleep efficacy, relying 
instead on traditional objective measures of sleep quantity and/or subjective reports of sl eep 
quality (NIH 2005) .

Version 9/3/[ADDRESS_859468] common theories of insomnia is focused on  the idea of hyperarousal (for  
a review see (Riemann et al 2010) ).  Although there is support for this theory from a wide range 
of fields, including physiolog ical and neuroendocrine  studies , the majority of evidence  come s 
from either  electroe ncephalographic  (EEG)  or neuroimaging investigati ons.  Several studies have 
reported increases in higher frequency EEG activity (i.e. beta and gamma bands) during various 
stages of sleep (Buysse et al 2008, Freedman 1986, Krystal et al 2002, Merica et al 1998, Perl is 
et al 2001a, Perlis et al 2001b)  suggestive of an aroused brain .  Unfortunately , all of these studies 
derived their results based on the few EEG channels typi[INVESTIGATOR_642099] a routine sleep 
laboratory polysomnography (PSG) , making it impossible to de termine if the increase in high 
frequencies was ubiquitous across the whole brain or whether certain cortical areas were more 
aroused than others.   The seminal work of Nofzinger  et al.  (Nofzinger et al 2004)  using positron 
emission tomography (PET) provided the first direct evidence of regional hyperarousal in 
insomnia, show ing that the attenuated decline of metabolism , although global,  was highest in 
several cortical  region s, including the insular cortex, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortices .  
However, although PET imaging provides increased spatial resolution  over limited channel EEG,  
it provides a limited  imaging window (approximately 20 minutes)  that cannot provide temporal 
information across an entire night of sleep  or examine the processes sleep initiation or arousal 
with sufficient temporal resolution .  An earlier study using single pho ton emission tomography  
(SPECT) , instead showed  decreased blood flow (i.e. decreased activity) across all regions of 
interest (including frontal medial and lateral cortices) around the time of sleep onset  (Smith et al 
2002) .  Most likely these conflicting 
results are related to limited time 
imaging windows  (both during sleep 
onset, bu t SPECT integrating only 
over several minutes).   What is 
needed is to explore the role of  
hyperarousal in insomnia is an 
imaging tool that is  able to  1) resolve 
temporally whether hyperarousal is 
constant, fluctuates based on the 
ongoing pattern of EEG, or  is a 
specific , abnormal  reaction to 
incoming stimuli ; 2) resolve 
spatially  the difference between 
global and regional cortical arousal ; 
and 3) is conducive to examining sleep.   
Recent advances in electroencephalographic recording techniques have produced new 
ways to probe the process  and function of sleep.  Through t he use of high-density EEG ( hdEEG , 
256 channels), we are able to approach the spatial resolution of other brain imaging modalities 
while affording the millisecond temporal resolution of EEG and  providing a direct measure of 
the underlying brain activity , unlike the indirect and/or secondary biophysical signals of brain 
hemodynamics/metabolism  obtained with PET or fMRI that are suboptimal for exploring the 
short -lived spatio -temporal dynamics of many brain  processes .  While most EEG analysis is

Version 9/3/[ADDRESS_859469] shown that both slow waves and spi[INVESTIGATOR_36874], characteristic sleep 
EEG waveforms, are useful measures of localized brain activity.  HdEEG  has reve aled t hat sleep 
is more intense (more slow wave activity, EEG power between 0.5 – 4 Hz ) in the cortical regions 
that learn the most during waking , thus  demonstrating that n ot only do slow waves reflect sleep 
intensity, but they  also reflect the underlying the cellular need for sleep in a regionally specific 
manner  (Huber et al 2007, Huber et al 2006, Huber et al 2004, Huber et al 2008, Matta et al 
2010, Sarasso et al 2010) . Additionally , sleep slow waves have been sh own to travel across the 
cortical mantle from distinct origins (Massimini et al 2004) .  Notably, the cortical hot spots for 
slow wave origination and propagation include the insula and the anterior cingulate, PET -
identified reg ions of hyperactivation in insomnia  (Murphy et al 2009) (Figure 1). 
We have extensive experience using hdEEG technology to study brain activity and sleep 
abnormalities in va rious neuropsychiatric 
conditions , including insomnia .  We have 
identified sleep spi[INVESTIGATOR_642100], which have been suggested 
to have an etiopathologic role in the 
disorder and may be one of the most 
specific biomarkers for the disorde r 
(Ferrarelli et al 2007, Ferrarelli et al 2010) .  
In depression, we have found evidence for 
abnormalities in sleep homeostasis through 
analyses of brain activity during sleep and 
wakefulness prior to and following 
nocturnal sleep (Goldstein et al 2012, 
Plante et al 2013b)  as well as a regionally  
specific decrease in slow waves in 
hypersomnolent depressives (Plante et al 
2012b) .  Our preliminary work in insomnia  
under previously approved protocols H-
2007 -0150 , and continuing with H -2009 -
0019, (comparing 9 subjects with primary 
insomnia,  9 age - and sex -matched 
depressives and 9 matched healthy sleepers , 
Table 1 ) revealed that beta and gamma 
activity were increased globally in both 
insomnia and depressi on in comparison  to 
controls, but only alpha activity, 
particularly in deeper sleep (stage N 3) distinguished primary insomnia from depressed and 
control s ubjects .  Notably, when localized in the cortex, these increases in  alpha during N3 sleep 
were most prominent  in primary sensory and associative cortices ( including somatosensory, 
auditory and visual cortices), suggesting that even during the deepest stage  of sleep, sensory 
areas are still relatively active in insomnia relative to controls  (Figure 2) .  Our primary  aim, then, 
would be to extend and confirm this result in a larger group o f primary insomnia participants in 

Insomnia and Sleep Patterns Study

Version 9/3/2015  order to  increase our localization po wer, to see whether this increase persists throughout the 
night d uring normal sleep, or is specific to stage N3, and to determine if it is particularly 
associated with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance difficulties; we will also  examine how this 
finding  relates to the process of falling into and arousing from sleep.  
   
2.[ADDRESS_859470]  begun to  
use hdEEG to examine  the process 
of falling asleep in normal  subjects .  
Although  it has long been 
recognized that falling asleep 
involves a process developi[INVESTIGATOR_642101] (for instance see Hori’s nine -
stage system and EEG waveforms, 
(Hori et al 1994) , how this process 
develops across the cortex is just 
now being elucidate d.  We recently 
demonstrated that cortical areas that 
have been overly taxed during the 
day may go offline even while the 
rest of the cortex remains awake 
(Hung et al 2013) .  Moreover, we 
have used serial awakenings 
(repeatedly presenting stimuli to 
subjects to systematically wake them up throughout the night) in a g roup of normal subjects to 
describe how different waveforms contribute to falling asleep in a regionally specific manner  by 
[CONTACT_642133] 
(10-20 channel Oz) and the first slow wa ve burst (2 consecutive slow waves withou t an arousal 
(Siclari  et al. in preparation ).  In good sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_438901], s low waves followed two spatially and 
temporally distinct processes during the transition from wakefulness to sleep.   The early process 
was c haracterized by [CONTACT_642134], large amplitude slow waves that involved mainly the frontal 
regions and w as associated with high gamma power.   The late process was marked by [CONTACT_642135], and  to involve also 
the temporal, lateral parietal and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_642102] .  The falling asleep process is  thus 
characterized by a transition from predominantly local to increasingly global sleep patterns .  This 
process may be disrupted in insomnia, parti cularly given the similarit ies between  areas from 
which  slow waves involve d only later in the falling asleep process  originate  and areas  exhibiting 
alpha activity during deep NREM sleep in insomnia patients.  
Certainly sleep initiation is not the only poten tial problem in people with insomnia ; 
frequent awakenings during the night are commonly reported by [CONTACT_336260] .  However, there 
is surprisingly little literature examining the response of insomnia subjects to arousing stimuli.  
Limited channel e vent rel ated potential studies during sleep seem to support the theory of 
hyperarousal  in insomnia subjects,  especially during the sl eep onset period (Bastien et al 2008, 
Devoto et al 2005, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_642103] 2012, Yang & L o 2007) , despi[INVESTIGATOR_642104] (Mendelson et al 1986) .  However, without the ability to localize the 

Insomnia and Sleep Patterns Study  
Page 6 of 22 
Version 9/3/2015  cortical sources of the brain’s response to suc h stimulation, it is difficult to draw strong 
conclusions.  We now know from other imaging techniques as well as from our own work with 
hdEEG that external stimuli do reach the cortex even during the deepest stages of sl eep (Dang -
Vu et al 2011, Riedner et al 2011) .  The degree to which such stimuli could be locally arousing 
the cortex is unknown , and it is likely that insomnia patients may show different patterns of 
reactivity than healthy sleepers .    
   In summary,  the use of hdEEG to study sleep in insomnia  with and without depression  
affords a unique opportunity to image the brain with exquisite temporal resolution throughout the 
sleep period.  Not only can we study the spatial and temporal dynamics of sleep throu ghout the 
night, but we can also examine the processes of falling asleep and  arousing from sleep; these 
critical events are likely to be particularly important for understanding insomnia, since they 
reflect the primary complaints of insomnia patients —difficulty falling asleep and difficulty 
maintaining sleep.  No other currently available imaging technique is capable of providing 
functional imaging data t hroughout the sleep process  or in individuals who can sleep without 
restriction of their normal nocturna l movement. Furthermore, in contrast to other imaging 
procedures, hdEEG is relatively inexpensive, portable, and can performed repeatedly making it 
ideal for longitudinal studies.  Our preliminary data in a small number of subjects already shows 
significan t differences in topographic patterns of sleep EEG activity in comparison not only to 
healthy sleepers but also depressed subjects, suggesting that the technique will be able to detect 
abnormalities in brain activity patterns that are specific for insomnia .  Even more importantly, 
we can localize  one of these insomnia -specific abnormalities,  increases in alpha activity during 
deep stages of sleep , to sensory areas of the cortex, strongly suggesting that these specific areas 
remain relatively a ctivated durin g sleep.   The proposed study will provide novel data regarding 
mechanisms of insomnia and  will be used to design future studies that will assess the effects  of 
insomnia treatments  on patterns of abnormal brain activity.  The identification of specifi c 
abno rmalities during sleep as well as in the processes  of falling asleep  or arousing from sleep 
will potentially allow us to distinguish the effects of pharmacologic treatments that promote 
sleep through different mechanisms, such as by [CONTACT_642136], blocking 
histamine receptors or blocking orexin receptors.   
 
3. Specific Aims  
 
3.1. Primary Objectives:  
 
1. Examine  differences in  the cortical sources of sleep waveforms in insomnia patients with and 
without depression compared to healthy sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_642105].  
2. Define cortical source abnormalities in the processes of falling asleep and arousing from 
sleep in insomnia patients  with and without depression  compared to healthy sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_642106].  
 
3.2 Secondary Objectives:  
 
1. Correlate abnormalities in sleep EEG patterns with specific insomnia symptoms, including 
sleep onset difficulties, sleep maintenance problems, nonrestorative sleep and daytime 
dysfunction.  
Insomnia and Sleep Patterns Study  
Page 7 of 22 
Version 9/3/2015  2. Define abnormalities in overnight changes in waking EEG activity in insomnia patients with 
and without depression compared to healthy sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_438901].  
3. Explore whether abnormalities in sleep and waking EEG activity in insomnia patients, with 
and without depression, normalize following treatment with a sleep medication.  
 
 3.3 Clinical H ypotheses:  
 
1. Insomnia patients will show increased regional EEG alpha activity in sensory cortical areas 
particularly during sleep.  
2. Insomnia patients will show abnormalities in the process of sleep initiation, including 
regional sources of high frequency EEG activity that will interfere with the normal 
progression of the sleep process.  
3. Insomnia patients will show abnormalities in the regional patterns of cortical arousal 
responses to external stimuli during sleep, particularly in the sensory cortical areas exhibiting 
increased alpha activity.  
4. Abnormalities in sleep EEG patterns may be correlated with specific insomnia symptoms, 
particularly difficulty with sleep initiation or maintenance.  
5. Waking EEG in insomnia patients will not show overnight recovery compared to controls, 
which will be correlated with specific EEG abnormalities  during sleep, such as elevations in 
higher frequency activity.  
6. Explore whether insomnia patients with and without depression differ in abnormalities in 
sleep EEG patterns.  
 
4. Research Design and Method s 
 
4.1 Study Population  
 
Studies will be carried out in 20 individuals with insomnia , 20 individuals with 
depression and insomnia,  and 20 age - and sex -matched healthy controls (women and men aged 
18-45 years who are English speaking).  We will ensure that our sample includes individuals 
with both sleep onset and maintenance issues, and that at least 1/[ADDRESS_859471] 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be applied to the sample to reduce the variability of the data and 
avoid confounding factor s.   
 
4.1.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
To be included in the insomnia group, participants will need to score ≥ 11 on the ISI  
(Morin et al 2011) , meet RDC (Edinger et al 2004 ) for insomnia, and have in somnia for 6 
months or longer. To be included in the depression and insomnia group, participants will need to  
meet  insomnia criteria and additionally meet criteria for a Major Depressive Epi[INVESTIGATOR_642107]. To be in cluded in the healthy control group, participants will need to score ≤ 7 on 
the ISI and not meet RDC for insomnia.   
 
4.1.2 Exclusion Criteria

head trauma or loss of consciousness > 30 minutes; a score less than 27 on the Mini -Mental 
Status Exam (MMSE) (Folstein et al 1975) ; regular psychotropic medication use within two 
weeks of beginning the protocol  with the exception of those in the depression and insomnia 
group (these individuals will be all owed to remain on psychotropic medications  with the 
exception of sleep medications or other psychotropic medications with large concern for 
impacting hdEEG recordings; if participants are on medications of concerns, they will be 
excluded from the study)  (Bastien et al 2003, Borbely et al 1985, Brunner et al 1991, Feige et al 
1999, Monti et al 2000) ; current regular tobacco use; >  3 caffeinated beverages per day; 
significant neurologic or medical illness , including de mentia ; women who are pregnant, < [ADDRESS_859472] -partum, or planning to become pregnant during the study; and left -handedness (due 
to effects on sleep topography).  Participants will be excluded if they indicate  imminent risk for 
self-harm or suicide (APA 1994) , alcohol or drug dependence/abuse  within the last [ADDRESS_859473] demonstrate a typi[INVESTIGATOR_642108] 9pm and 9am 
(confirmed via self -report and actigraphy) . To ensure exclusion of participants with sleep apnea, 
participants must exhibit an apnea -hypo nea index (AHI) less than 10 (as assessed via 
ApneaLink) . Participants  in the insomnia and control groups  will also be excluded if they met 
criteria for  any active DSM -IV Axis I disorder  other than insomnia . Participants in the 
depression and insomnia grou p will be excluded if they indicate a lifetime history of bipolar 
disorder or schizophrenia .  
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_859474] Identification and Recruitment  
 
Subjects will be recruited via advertisements ( i.e., newspaper, internet, newsletters, local 
postings), referrals f rom health care providers, referrals from patient advocacy/support groups, 
and word of mouth. A phone screening will be used to pre -select the subjects eligible to 
participate before their first visit to our laboratory  (see section 4.2.1) .  
Subjects with insomnia and/or depression  will primarily be recruited via advertisements 
and referrals from local physicians and mental health care providers , including through the UW 
Sleep Disorders Center and the UW Department of Psychiatry . Clinicians, including 
invest igators involved with this study, may inform their referrals and patients about the study, 
either verbally or with printed materials approved by [CONTACT_1201]. Patients who may be eligible will  
also be reviewed through the medical chart. Following the review of their medical record,  
providers will receive a prompt that the patient is potentially eligible for the study along with a 
quick checklist of I/E criteria to complete. The prompt will be delivered via HealthLink message, 
and the checklist will be placed in the provider's clinic mailbox. Providers introducing referrals 
or patients to the study  can provide their patients with the study’s contact [CONTACT_642137]'s permission  via permission to contact [CONTACT_642138]. Patient s may have the option to meet with 
study staff face -to-face before leaving the clinic from an appointment with his/her provider  
(contingent upon study staff availability and patient’s prefere nce) versus being contact[CONTACT_642139] . If a potential subject is a patient of one of the investigator’s 
clinic patients, another investigator who does not have a clinical relationship with the subject 
Insomnia and Sleep Patterns Study

Version 9/3/[ADDRESS_859475] t he investigators will complete the same screening  interview  as 
psychi atric subjects (see section 4.2.1) .  
 
4.[ADDRESS_859476] undergo a screening interview  to determine initial 
eligibility for the study. After providing a description of the study procedures, subjects  will be 
asked a series of questions  by a study staff member about their physical and mental health, sleep, 
and other inclusion/exclusion criteria. Screening interview  data from subjects who are not 
eligible or do not ultimately sign a consent/HIPAA form wil l be destroyed.  Some participants 
will complete this screening in person at a regular clinic visit if their provider refers them to the 
study and the study team is available.  For these participants, verbal consent will be obtained 
prior to the screening like with screenings completed over the phone. Written informed consent 
will be obtained for all participants during the baseline screening visit.  
 
Baseline Screening  (Visit 1)  
This visit will begin with the informed consent process.  As part of this consent procedure, 
participants may give p ermission for the UW study team to contact [CONTACT_642140]. If permission is given, the UW study team will store their names and contact 
[CONTACT_3031] (i.e., telephone number and/or email address). This information will not be 
distributed to any other non -UW study entities (e.g., [COMPANY_006]).  Participants  then will be evaluated 
for insomnia with RDC  criteria and complete the ISI.  They will also complete the Edinburgh 
Handedness Questionnaire (EHQ) (Oldfield 1971) , answer some demographic questions,  and 
undergo the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_72443] 
1992) , MMSE,  Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) (Hamilton 199 6), and an 
unstructured clinical interview for sleep disorders, medical disorders and habits.   Participants 
may be audio and video recorded during these assessments  except when illicit substance use is 
assessed  to ensure that interviews are valid and relia ble. Recordings will only be viewed by [CONTACT_642141].  Height 
and weight will be collected for all participants.  Women  will complete a urine pre gnancy test  and 
phase of menstrual  cycle and birth control medication will be monitored (via self -report) 
througho ut participation in the study. After initial screening, participants will complete

Version 9/3/2015  questionnaire measures of pre -sleep somatic and cognitive arousal (i.e., the Pre -Sleep Arousa l 
Scale, PSAS (Nicassio et al 1985) ), thought content when having difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_21693] (i.e.,  
the Glasgow Content of Thoughts Inventory, GCTI (Harvey & Espie 2004) ), negative sleep -
related cognitions (i.e., the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale, DBAS  (Morin 
et al 2007) , and general somatic and cognitive arousal (i.e., the Depression Anxiet y Stress 
Scales, DASS (S.H. & P.F. 1995)  and Penn Sta te Worry Questionnaire, PSWQ  (Meyer et al 
1990) ). If time permits, w e may also administer the University of Pennsylvania Computerized 
Neuropsychological Panel  (Penn CNP) to cover other cognitive domains such as verbal memory, 
emotion recognition, and abstract reasoning/decision making. Please find a more detailed 
description  of the Penn CNP  in the supplemental materials  section of the IRB Initial Application . 
Although all tasks may be administered (all listed in supplemental attachment), the tasks that we 
most commonly use are highlighted on the first page. This first visit will last approximately 3 to 
4 hours.  
All study questionnaires will be reviewed by [CONTACT_642142] (i.e., Drs. Benca, 
Rumble, or Hanley) before the participant departs. If participants report depression and/or 
suicidality on their study questionnaires  or interviews , they will be provided with a list of 
community resources (see Supp lemental Materials) and encouraged to seek outside treatment. If 
they endorse suicidality that is at a level of imminent risk, they will be directed to the emergency 
department for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Study staff will ensure that the participant reached the h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_642109] -up with the participant and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]. Participants who are referred for depression 
treatment may still be eligible to participate in our study provided that they continue to meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. However, participants at imminent risk of harm to themselves will 
not be eligible (as noted in the exclusion criteria).  
 
At-Home Overnight Sleep Study  and Actigraphy with Sleep Logs  (prior to Visit 2)  
Participants will complete an at -home screening test for sleep apnea, using a  three 
channel recording of airflow, respi[INVESTIGATOR_642110]™ (ResMed 
Corp, Poway, CA ). Persons who demonstrate an AHI > [ADDRESS_859477] -worn 
actigraphy ( a wrist -watch -like device that me asures activity level; Actiwatch, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_130747], 
Murraysville, PA) supplemented by [CONTACT_55628] -wake logs to confirm self -reported sleep -wake 
patterns .. Activity profiles w ill be analyzed using Actiware.  Of all published quantitative criteria 
to discriminate th ose with insomnia from good sleepers, sleep -wake log cut -off values have been 
the most reliable, even in comparison to PSG  (Edinger et al 2013, Lineberger et al 2006) . Thus, 
quantitative criteria derived from sleep -wake logs will be used to classify whether insomnia 
participants have sleep initiation (i.e., an average of 20 minutes or greater of SOL) or sleep 
maintenance insomnia (i.e., an average of 20 minutes or greater of WASO, excluding terminal 
WASO). If insomni a participants do not meet either of these established quantitative criteria, 
they wi ll be excluded from the study. Actigraphy will be used to confirm classification and to 
further rule out any participant who has a circadian rhythm disorder (i.e., regular  sleep phase 
occurring out of the range of 9pm -9am).

Baseline hdEEG Sleep Recording (Visit 2)  
Participants will come to the Wisconsin Sleep laboratory (accredited by [CONTACT_642143]) for their fir st hdEEG night  approximately 1 to 2 hours before their 
usual bedtime . During this visit, waking and sleep hdEEG (256 channels) recordings will be 
acquired using an Electrical Geodesics NetAmps 300 System.  The hdEEG and PSG systems 
(i.e., Geodesics System a nd Alice 5 System) have 510(k) clearance and are  being used in 
accord ance with the indications in their  labeling . Prior to sleep, spontaneous eyes open and eyes

Participants will also complete some questionnaire  measures prior to bedtime, including 
measures of arousal and mood  (i.e., DASS, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and State -Trait 
Anxiety In ventory (STAI) ). The sleep hdEEG will be integrated with clinical polysomnography 
(PSG) using the Alice 5 Sleepware system to further rule out common sleep problems such as 
periodic leg movements (PLMs). Sensors to be included for the clinical PSG will be:  EOG, chin 
and leg EMG, EKG , and SpO2 ; optional PSG sensors may be included depending on the subject 
comfort or if the ApneaLink results were inconclusive, including nasal cannula, thermistor,  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_642112], a snore microphone, and a position sensor. The entire setup for this recording 
takes approximately [ADDRESS_859480] s. In addition to providing important information for assessing 
sleep, audio/video monitoring provides additional subject safety by [CONTACT_642144]. After the completion of the study , these recordings will be erased. 
Particip ants will be excluded if they evidence a periodic limb movement arousal index >10. 
Oximetry data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_642145] (ODI >5) or hypoxemia (oxyhemoglobin saturation <89% for more than 5 min)  will be 
excluded; this is unli kely after baseline  screening.  Participants will also complete some 
questionnaire measures upon awakening, including measures of arousal and mood  (e.g., GCTI, 
PSAS , VAS, STAI , Post -Sleep Questionnaire ) in addition to waking EEG , evoked potential 
recordings , and the brief attention tasks, time permitting .   
 
Serial Awakening hdEEG Sleep Recording (Visit 3)  
Visit 3 will be scheduled for the following night, unless scheduling does not permit. In 
the event that the participant is  unable to return the following night, Visit 3 will be scheduled for 
within two weeks of Visit 2 and participants will wear actigraphy during that time. For 
participants completing Visit 3 the following night, they  will spend the next day in their usual 
activities but will be instructed not to sleep; they will wear actigraphy  to verify that they were 
not sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_642113]. They will return that night  approximately 1 to 2 hours 
before their usual bedtime  to complete a second hdEEG study (Vis it 3).  During this visit they 
Insomnia and Sleep Patterns Study  
Page 12 of 22 
Version 9/3/2015  may repeat the w aking EEG , evoked potential recordings , arousal measures, and attention tasks . 
They will also complete some questionnaires prior to bedtime ( i.e., VAS and STAI ). Additional 
PSG channels (including EOG, EMG , EKG, and optional PSG sensors if warranted ) will be 
applied prior to lights out to assist in accurate sleep staging. All participants will then complete 
the serial awakening night in which participants are periodically probed with auditory stimuli 
during the  night.  After the onset of sleep, participants will be awakened repeatedly using [ADDRESS_859481] on sleep stability (Dang -Vu et al 2010, McKinney et al 2011) . After 
indicating that they have heard the tone, subjects will confirm that they are awake by [CONTACT_642146] “What was the last thing going through your mind after hearing the sound” and 
“were you awake or asleep”.  Participants will then be encoura ged to fall back asleep. We will 
aim to evoke at least 1-2 awakenings in each stage (N1,  N2, N3, REM) for the first [ADDRESS_859482]’s normal waking time and they will be 
allowed to sleep ad libitum after this time if they wish.  Participants will also complete some 
questionnaire measures upo n awakening, including measures of arousal and mood  (e.g., GCTI, 
PSAS , VAS, STAI , Post -Sleep Questionnaire ), as well as waking EEG , evoked potential 
recordings , and the brief attention tasks if time permits . As before, participants will be under 
constant s taff sup ervision during the recording. If participants are unable to sleep longer but do 
not feel rested, we will provide transportation back home.  
 
Follow -up hdEEG Sleep Recording (Visit 4)  
Visit [ADDRESS_859483] 10 healthy sleepers will be invited as stability of recordings is less of a concern, 
though collecting a sub -sample will help to confirm stability nonetheless. Participants with 
depression and insomnia will be invited if their participation is deemed clinically appropriate by 
[CONTACT_75872] (e.g., if a participant is not on a psychotropic  medication that will interfere with 
recordings at baseline, but has desire to start a psychotropic medication for depression that would 
interfere with recordings in the near future, we would not invite this participant so that his/her 
study participation time is kept to minimal time and depression treatment can commence).  
 
Repetition of Visits 2 and 3 in Insomnia Patients on Sleep Medication (Visits 5 and 6)  
 Visits 5 and 6 are optional for participants with insomnia, either with our without 
depression. So me participants in the study may choose to return to or initiate treatment for 
insomnia with a sleep medication under the supervision of their personal doctor. Participants 
who ch oose to begin a sleep medication following completion of Visits 2 and 3 (and 4, if they 
opt to complete this optional visit) will be invited to return to the laboratory to repeat Visit 2 (as 
Visit 5) and Visit 3 (as Visit 6) procedures. Visits 5 and 6 will follow exactly the procedures 
outlined in Visits 2 and 3, respectively.

For Visit 2, 3, 4 , 5, or 6 , if technical problems arise during completion of the protocol (e.g., 
mechanical issues, mistakes with administration of the protoco l), study staff may ask participants 
to complete that visit again. If the participant agrees, the visit will be rescheduled at the 
participant’s convenience. They will be paid again for the visit.

(DSMB). However, serious adverse events and unanticipated problems would be reported to the 
IRB in acco rdance with posted IRB guidance 
(http://kb.wisc.edu/images/group78/[ZIP_CODE]/ReportingTimeframesJanuary2013.pdf ). 
In addition, there will be a formal process for review and mo nitoring of study -related 
adverse events. All adverse events are evaluated at each visit by [CONTACT_642147], will 
be reported to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours – or immediately depending on severity. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_642114] -investigators will review cumulative data on adverse 
events at least every [ADDRESS_859486] regular 
(i.e., at least monthly) internal audits of all study materials (e.g., completed partici pant materials,

and that there are no deviations from the IRB -approved protocol.

to base sample size calculations. However, the substantial pi[INVESTIGATOR_642115] a population 
of insomnia patients as well as age - and sex - matched controls for one of the primary hypotheses 
(2.7.2a) allows us to confidently support our proposed choice of sample size. The Cohen’s d 
effect size averaged across the signif icant source cluster was 1.15.  Our power to detect an effect 
of this  magnitude in our proposed final sample size of 20 per group using an alpha level of 
p=.05, 2 -tailed would be approximately 94%. Our power to detect the difference between 
potential subgroups of sleep maintenance versus sleep onset with the insomnia group alone (10 
per group) would be approximately 68%. Furthermore, on the basis of other similar analyses 
with relatively small sample sizes (e.g. - <20 subjects per group) examining local sleep 
homeostasis (Huber et al 2004) , the traveling phenomena of slow waves (Massimini et al 2004) ,

reduction in hypersomnolent depressives (Plante et al 2012b) , sleep spi[INVESTIGATOR_642116] (Ferrarelli et al 2007, Ferrarelli et al 2010) , the current study design should 
provide us with adequate statistical power.  
 
4.4.2 Proposed Data Analytic Strategy  
 
Ruth Benca MD, PhD (PI) , Brady Riedner, PhD , and Meredith Rumble, PhD  will be 
responsible for performing and overseein g data collection and analysis.  Statistical analysis will 
be planned and executed in conjunction with UW BARD ( https://ic tr.wisc.edu/Biostatistic s). 
Although our preliminary work has allowed us to identify several primary objectives, described 
below, with clearly identified primary outcome measures and a priori analysis plans, the 
protocol is also largely designed to be exploratory in nature. Ther efore, it is likely that several 
promising analysis paths will emerge once the data have been collected that cannot be formally 
identified in advance, but that are in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_642117]. Such additional explorato ry analyses naturally raise the issue of multiple comparisons. 
Our laboratory has been a leader in designing and implementing the use of hdEEG in sleep, 
particularly in clinical populations, and has been successful in funding and publishing this type 
of ex ploratory research. Where appropriate, established procedures will be used to evaluate a 
family of related questions (e.g., ANOVA for comparison between groups across frequency 
bands) with reasonably chosen post -hoc corrections for multiple comparisons (e. g., Bonferroni). 
However, in all cases these procedures will be adapted to account for the most pervasive multiple 
comparison problem in hdEEG and other neuroimaging (independent tests between hundreds of 
electrodes or thousands of potential cortical sourc es) using statistical nonparametric mappi[INVESTIGATOR_642118] (SnPM) as described below.   
 
Normal hdEEG sleep imaging  (Primary Objective 1)  
  Sleep stages will be visually scored for [ADDRESS_859488] criteria 
(AASM). The study Principle Investiga tor, [CONTACT_642153], a board -certified sleep specialist with over 
25 years of scoring experience and the medical director of the Wisconsin Sleep laboratory, will 
supervise the scoring and review all studies for the presence of any clinical sleep disorders. Data  
preprocessing and analysis of sleep data will be performed using NetStation (EGI) as well as 
custom made software using Matlab (Mathworks) and EEGlab packages. Power spectra of 
consecutive 6 -s epochs (FFT routine, Welch’s averaged modified periodgram with  Hamming 
window) will be computed for all derivations in order aid in identification of artifacts and for 
initial scalp exploration. Only epochs without artifacts will be used for further analysis. Given 
the frequency of muscle and eye movements, additiona l REM artifacts will be removed using 
scalp -level temporal independent component analysis (ICA). Data will be analyzed both in the 
time (e.g. slow wave and spi[INVESTIGATOR_642119]) and frequency domains. As stated above, 
one of the primary study objecti ves is to e xamine differences in the cortical sources of sleep 
waveforms in insomnia patients with and without depression compared to healthy sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_642120] . The initial step of the planned analysis will be to explore the scalp 
level  EEG sleep power topographies of different frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Sigma, 
Beta, Gamma)  across the groups and across sleep stages (N1, N2, N3, REM) throughout the 
entire night in order to identify reasonable temporal window(s) for further anal ysis as  
computational demands of cortical source imaging require that the data to be analyzed is on the 
Insomnia and Sleep Patterns Study  
Page 16 of 22 
Version 9/3/[ADDRESS_859489] ( identified  by [CONTACT_340913] -level analysis  from the initial steps, e.g. alpha ) using a distributed 
inverse solution (i.e. LORETA, for details of the methods involved see (Murphy et al 2011) ). All 
group comparisons of distributed source localization maps will be analyzed using statistical 
nonparametric mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (SnPM) (Nichols & Holmes 2002)  which is ideally suited to address the 
multiple comparison issues inherent to neuroimaging and which does not make unwarranted 
assumptions about data distribution. This metho d has been successfully applied in a number of 
hdEEG studies in our laboratory  (Ferrarelli et al 2007, Huber et al 2006, Huber et al 2004) , and 
compares favorably with Statistical Parametric Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_642121].  
 
Falling asleep imaging  (Primary Objective 2a)  
  During both the baseline and serial awakening sleep nights, the descent into (or back 
into) sleep will be analyzed by [CONTACT_642148][INVESTIGATOR_17399] l 
alpha and the first instance of a burst of slow waves (more than 2 slow waves consecutively 
without an arousal) into [ADDRESS_859490] and then within group prior to statistical analysis.  
      
Sleep arousal imaging  (Primary Objective 2b)  
During both the baseline and serial awakening sleep nights, spontaneous 
arousals/awakenings will also be explored using similar methods to the falling asleep analysis 
except the windows of interest will be fixed at 12 seconds (10 intervals = 2 minutes) given that 
there is no a priori  criteria for establishing the arousal onset. Additionally, f or the serial 
awakening s leep nights, stimulus evoked responses during sleep will be examined using similar 
methods as described above, both in time (evoked potential analysis) and time -frequency (event 
related spectral perturbation) as we have done previously (Landsness et al 2009, Riedner et al 
2011)  except the analysis window will be temporally fixed around the stimulus trigger (15 sec 
window, including 2 seconds before and 3 seconds after 10 second auditory stimulus onset and 
offset, res pectively). Arousals will be scored according to established arousal criteria (Bonnet et 
al 2007) . Stimuli will be categorized into those that did not cause an arousal, those that did cause 
an arousal, and those that resulted in a full awakening . The outcome measures addressing the 
second primary objective will be similar to the outcome measure for the first primary objective, 
cortical localization maps of band -pass filtered EEG data, except that the temporal windows of 
interest will be predefine d as described above. Further exploratory analyses will employ Cox 
regression (see McKinney et al) to investigate  the ability of alpha in particular cortical regions of 
interest (defined in the baseline analysis) to predict sleep stability in i nsomnia pati ents and 
controls.  
 
Correlations between EEG abnormalities and behavioral variables  
Comparison of behavioral data, as well as traditional sleep architecture variables will be 
analyzed using established procedures (e.g. ANOVA for repeated  measures and post -hoc tests).  
Insomnia and Sleep Patterns Study  
Page 17 of 22 
Version 9/3/2015  Correlations with EEG and/or source localization of power will either be examined using a 
region of interest approach or using SnPM techniques to explore cortical areas whose activity 
may be related to the variable of interest, depending on t he nature of the exploratory analysis.  
 
Waking EEG and E voked Potentials  analysis  
EEG data will be analyzed similar to sleep and the presentation of stimuli during sleep 
except that planned comparisons will be performed between recordings made during the evening 
before and  morning after baseline sleep. Exploratory analyses will also be conducted on this 
comparison across the serial awakening night to examine the differential effect of sleep 
disruption.   
 
4.[ADDRESS_859491] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_642122]-report data will be collected using electronic (e.g., computer tasks or questionnaires) and 
paper -based (e.g., paper questionnaires and interviews) formats.  The study data will be managed

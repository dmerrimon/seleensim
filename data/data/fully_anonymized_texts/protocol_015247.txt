Title of Study:  
A Dose -escalation Study to Detect Urease -producing Bacteria in Lungs of Healthy Volunteers  and 
Subjects  with Cystic Fibrosis  Using Aerosolized 13C-urea 
Indication :  Use of a 13C-urea breath tes t in the qualitative detection of urease -containing bacteria in the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_875569] -treatment detection  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_875570]:   This is a single -center, single -administration, dose -escalation study designed to determine 
the safety and dose response of aerosolized 13C-urea 20 mg and 50  mg in detecti ng urease -producing 
bacteria in the lungs of healthy volunteers  (those without and those diagnosed with Helicobacter pylori  
infection ) and in subject s with cystic fibrosis (CF) .  Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_875601] a non -leading question a bout adverse events.  
The dose will not be escalated until at least [ADDRESS_1222867] experiences dose -limiting toxicity.   
After the safety of the maximum dose  in the cohort of healthy volunteers without H. pylori  infection  has 
been reviewed  by a data safety monitor , healthy volunteers diagnosed with H. pylori  infection and 
subjects with CF will be  enrolled .  Three subjects diagnosed with  H. pylori  infection will be tested at the 
maximum dose to assess potential interference of urease producing bacteria in the stomach ; subjects 
infected with H. pylori  can be enrolled at any time after the safety of the maximum dose in healthy 
volunteers without H. pylori  infection has been evaluated, but they will meet the entrance criteria for 
healthy volunteers without H. pylori  infection . 
Sputum will be collected from each subject with CF before administering study drug in order to i dentify 
bacterial flora using two standard microbiologic methods. The first is a quantitative method in which 
colonies are stained and counted, the second is a colorimetric method in which a sample is plated in a 
medium that changes to a blue color as its pH is increased by [CONTACT_875602], a by -product of 
the urease -catalyzed degradation of urea.  
Study Duration:   The maximum duration of study participation for each subject  is approximately 9 days:

University of New Mexico Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 CYSTIC FIBROSIS  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease whi ch affects approximately 30,[ADDRESS_1222878] increased t he average lifespan to about 35  years with respi[INVESTIGATOR_875572].  
The CF gene that codes  the CF protein  (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
[CFTR ]) was discovered in 1989.  CFTR is a protein that regulates the flows of ions , including 
chloride and bicarbonate , across membranes.  
One consequence of abnormal CFTR is that glandular fluid s thick en, which  leads to obstruction 
of the ducts.  In the pancreas, th is obstruction blocks the release of digestive enzymes into the 
gastrointestinal tract , result ing in poor absorption of nutrients.  Patients with  CF take  
replacement pancreatic enzymes  before every meal to aid digestion and absorption.  
In the lungs of patients with CF, thickened  layers of fluid lining the airways obstruct  the removal 
of bacteria .  Bacteria that are normally present in healthy lungs, and that are normally washed out 
by [CONTACT_875605], are not cleared easily from lungs of patients with 
CF.  Urease -producing bacteria Staph ylococcus  aureus  and pseudomonas  are the most prominent 
bacteria found in increased numbers in lungs  of patients with CF .  As bacterial loads increase , 
patient s with CF start to develop mild ly increased symptoms such as cough , but they generally 
do not develop the dramatic signs of lung infection seen in healthy  patient s who have sudden  
increase s in bacteria that develop into  pneumonia.  
Patients with CF are followed in CF centers where the insidious nature of increasing bacterial 
loads is followed  by [CONTACT_875606] t hroat cultures at least every three months .  The bacterial 
profile of each patient is known and used to guide aggressive an tibiotic therapy for 
exacerbations .  All bacteria are not cleared  with antibiotic therapy , but it is believed that 
antibiotic therapy decreases bacterial burden.   It is further believed  that patients with CF would 
experience fewer or less severe exacerbati ons if more timely antibiotic therapy was administered  
in advance of exacerbations .  To date, however, the timing of these exacerbations cannot be 
predicted.  
1.[ADDRESS_1222879]  
University of New Mexico Confidential  For the intended indication, inhaled 13C-urea is catalytically hydrolyzed into 13C-carbon dioxide 
by [CONTACT_875607], an enzyme associated with certain bacter ial pathogens common to lung infection s in 
patients who develop CF (I). 
 13CO(NH 2)2 + 3H 2O urease→     13CO 2 + 2NH 4OH (I) 
By [CONTACT_875608] 13C-urea, the presence of urease -containing bacteria 
can be confirmed.  In the absence of urease -containing bacteria in the lungs, the isotopic ratio of 
13C to 12C in the baseline and test breath samples will be approximately the same.  If 
urease -containing bacteria are present within the lungs, the concentration of exhaled 13C will be 
increased measurably in the test breath sample relative to baseline.  It is not anticipated that the 
identity or numbers of organisms in the lungs can be deduced from the numer ical δ value 
reported by [CONTACT_875609], but it is anticipated that the magnitude of the numerical δ value will 
reflect the underlying bacterial load.  It is anticipated that urease -producing bacteria can be 
detected within [ADDRESS_1222880].  
1.3 UREA  
Urea has been approved by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA ) for oral administration  
(75 mg when  labeled with  13C) in the diagnosis of H. pylori  infection in the stomac h and f or 
intravenous administration  in high doses (500 to 1500  mg/kg/day, up to 120  g/day) as an osmotic 
diuretic to treat patients with cerebral edema and glaucoma .  There is a significant amount of 
safety and toxicology data of urea administration via these routes  (Crews and Davidson 1961 , 
Crews and Davidson 1962 , Gisbert and Pajares 2005 , Pathak et al 2004 , Pathak et al 2010 , 
Soupart and Decaux 1996 ). 
Urea liquefies  viscid mucus when injected into the auditor y canal (Bauer 1970 ) and is capable of 
reducing mucus viscosity and increasing mucus expectoration in lung diseases such a s chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , bronchiectasis, CF, and asthma when administered by 
[CONTACT_12699] . 
No adverse effects on lung function were reported when 2  to 14  g of urea was administered daily 
by [CONTACT_875610] -pressure ventilator over “short intervals” for 14  to 
30 days to 32  patients with chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosi s, asthma, bronchiectasis, and 
emphysema ; and no adverse effects were reported when approximately 7.3  g of urea was 
administered by [CONTACT_875611] 10  minutes to 6  patients with CF using a DeVilbis nebulizer  
(assuming 6  mL 2M urea/min)  (Waldron -Edward and Skoryna 1966 ). 
The mucolytic properties of urea have not been pursued , however,  because hyper tonic solutions 
were  subsequently shown to be a broncho -constrictor in patients with asthma (Cade and Pain 
1972 , Pain and Denborough 1967 ).  In one such study, mean forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 
1 second ( FEV 1) decreased 12 % ± 20% in 56  adults who inhaled urea aerosolized using a Wright 
nebuli zer (Cade and Pain 1972 ).  It is estimated that approximately 32  mg of urea was inhaled by 
[CONTACT_875612][INVESTIGATOR_875573] (output, 
University of New Mexico  Page [ADDRESS_1222881]  
University of New Mexico Confidential  0.13 mL/min; airflow, 9  L/min) and reported experimental detail (urea concentration, 4M; 
inhalation time, 10  min).  
It is now known that inhalation of  osmotic agents such as urea, mannitol, and hypertonic saline 
cause the release of mast cell mediators (histamine and leukotrienes) in patients with asthma, 
resulting in bronchospasm (Anderson 2010 , Brannan et al 2003 , Brannan et al 2009 , Sverrild et  
al 2009 ).  Hypertonic saline has been used as a test for bronchial hyper -responsiveness in 
patients with asthma , and is widely used, n onetheless, with preventive bronchodilator 
administration to treat hyper -responsive patients with CF. 
Overall , evidence points to the safety of inhaled urea.  As with all inhaled  solutions, it is possible 
that it will trigger some cough and bronchospasm ; this does not occur in all subjects , however,  
and when it does occur, it is mild and transient.  Further, pretreatment with a bronchodilator 
(albuterol) has been  shown to prevent the response in most subjects.  When bronchospasm does 
occur, it also can be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_875574].

the treatment regimen.  In laboratory experiments, urease -producing bacteria were detected 
within approximately 15  to 20  minutes after exposure to urea.  
1.5 BENEFIT -TO-RISK A SSESSMENT  
The safety profile of 13C-urea 20 mg and 50 mg administered by [CONTACT_875613] a 
dose escalation study conducted in two  parts at a single center located at  
University of New Mexico Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_875575]/Adult Pulmonary Clinic  
Ambulatory Care Center  
[ADDRESS_1222883] NE  
Albuquerque, NM  [ZIP_CODE]  
This facility has the required equipment/protocol on site to respond to an emergent adverse effect 
of treatment.  Co -investigators [CONTACT_875630] or Davies will be available on site should an 
emergent adverse event (such as severe bronchospasm or cardiopulmonary arrest) occur during 
study administration.  
This is the first study in humans of this 13C-urea breath test.  In part 1, a  conventional 
dose-escalation study design will assess the safety of inhaled 13C-urea in healthy volunteers.  The 
maximum dose administered will not exceed  [ADDRESS_1222884] estimated 
dose (32  mg) studied in humans (Cade and Pain 1972 ).  In part 2, the same dose -escal ation study 
design will assess the safety of inhaled 13C-urea in subjects with CF.  
University of New Mexico  Page [ADDRESS_1222885]  
University of New Mexico Confidential  Thus, the risk to subjects enrolled in this study is small; there is no direct benefit to subjects who 
enrolled.  The potential benefit of an early warning of accelerated co lonization of bacteria that 
compromises or destroys lung function that may extend or save lives  is significant .

and re spi[INVESTIGATOR_462028] ( respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], auscultation  [presence of wheezing and crackles ], 
pulse oximetry, and related symptoms, such as cough ). 
3.1.2 Secondary Endpoint  
The s econdary endpoint is the isotopic ratio of 13C to 12C in exhaled carbon dioxide of healthy 
volunteers and in subjects with CF  measured with the POCone detector (Meretek Diagnostics 
Group of Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Rockville, MD) before study drug administration and 
at 5, 10, and 15  minutes after stud y drug administration . 
3.1.3 Study Design  
This is a single -center, single -administration, dose -escalation study designed to determine the 
safety and dose response of aerosolized 13C-urea 20  mg and 50  mg in detecting urease -producing 
bacteria in the lungs of heal thy volunteers (those without and those diagnosed with H. pylori  
infection)  and in subjects with CF.  Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_875614] a non -leading question about adverse events.  
The dose will not be escalated until at least [ADDRESS_1222887] experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
After the safety of the maximum dose in the cohort of healthy volunteers without H. pylori  
infection has been reviewed by a data safety monitor, healthy volunteers diagnosed with H. 
pylori  infection and subjects with CF will be enrolled.  T hree subjects diagnosed with H. pylori  
infection will be tested at the maximum dose to assess potential interference of urease producing 
bacteria in the stomach; subjects infected with H. pylori  can be enrolled at any time after the 
safety of the maximum d ose in healthy volunteers without H. pylori  infection has been evaluated, 
but they will meet the entrance criteria for healthy volunteers without H pylori  infection.   
Subjects will be discharged from the study site after 30 minutes  or thereafter when oxyge n 
saturation levels and FEV 1 values return to baseline and coughing symptoms are resolved.  
Supportive treatment for symptom resolution, if needed, will be recorded on the case report form 
(CRF).

University of New Mexico Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS]  Dose -limiting Toxicity  
The following significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_875576]  (Rosenfeld et al 2011 ): 
• an absolute decrease from baseline FEV 1 of 20% of baseline  or gre ater 
• an absolute decrease from baseline oxygen saturation of at least 10% 
• an increase from baseline  respi[INVESTIGATOR_135890] 10  breaths per minute for more than 
2 minutes during quiet breathing  
• new wheezes or rales on examination . 
In addition to these events that are mandated DLT, the data safety monitor  may determine any 
serious adverse event attributed to study drug to be dose limiting.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Maximum Tolerated Dose  
The maximum tolerated dose is either the dose level administered before enrollment was stopped 
because of DLT or a lower dose if, in the data safety monitor’s  opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], significant evidence 
exists to reasonably predict an adverse safety profile at that dose  for the study drug.  
3.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN  
Aerosolized urea has bee n studied  in doses ranging from approximately 32  mg (Cade and Pain 
1972 ) to approximately over 7000  mg (Waldron -Edward and Skoryna 1966 ).  The present st udy 
investigates doses up to [ADDRESS_1222892] additional  lung 
pathogen s that may  also contribute to the signal ; the breath test is intended to be specific for 
urease -producing bacteria .  Pathogens in s putum cultures from subjects with CF will also be 
identified and tested for urease activity.  
Healthy volunteers diagnosed with H. pylori  infection are enrolled to determine whether a 
urease -producing pathogen in the stomach can produce 13C-carbon dioxide in exhaled breath 
within [ADDRESS_1222893]  risk by [CONTACT_875615] , beginning at a dose that approximates  0.1% of one that 
produced no adverse effects  in patients with CF and ending with a dose that approximates the 
minimum amount administered to patients with asthma.  
A maximum dose of [ADDRESS_1222894] therapy for relief of bronchospasm  (Eng et al 1996 ) and also for the 
prevention of bronchospa sm in diseases such as exercise -induced asthma  (Raissy et al 2008 ).  
Patients with CF are frequently pretreated with albuterol if a therapy may produce  
bronchospasm , e.g., inhalation of 7% saline .  Although nebulized isotonic solutions are not 
expected to produce bronchospasm, subjects with CF will be pretreated with albuterol because of 
the potential of mild bronchospasm induced from irritation of lung pathogens at the  time of study 
drug administration.  
The characterization of the pharmacokinetics of 13C-carbon dioxide will info rm the useful time 
interval during which the isotopic ratio of 13C to 12C can be measured after administration of 
study drug  in patients with lu ng infections  (Otsuka  America Pharmaceutical, Rockville, 
Maryland ).  Multiple breath specimens will be obtained at [ADDRESS_1222895] experiences DLT at  any dose level.  The 
data safety monitor  may terminate the study early by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_875577].

7.1.3 Microbial Analysis of Sputum  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overview  of Variables  
Sputum specimens will be obtained from subjects with CF after the performance of baseline 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_875586].  Specimens will be obtained using standard 
practices at the study site, and in all cases will be expectorated into a sterile sputum cup, labeled 
with the time of day, date , and unique study identifier for that patient.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Methods of Assessment  
The presence of urease -containing bacteria will be determined locally using  a colorimetric 
method in which a sampl e is plated in a medium that changes to a blue color as its pH is 
increased by [CONTACT_875602], a by -product of the urease -catalyzed degradation of 
urea (Cox et al 1977 , Damato et al 1982 , Isenberg 2004 ). 
Additionally, bacterial flora in collected sputum will be assessed using standard quantitative 
microbiologic methods employed at the study site in which colony forming units (CFU) are 
identified and counted, and in all cases organisms in numbers greater than 104 and appearing in 
more than one CFU will be identified and counted.  
7.2 SAFETY  VARIABLES  
The safety of 13C-urea will be assessed from a dverse events ( Section  8), spi[INVESTIGATOR_875571]

SUSPECTED  ADVERSE REACTIONS  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE ) as provided in this 
protocol.  During the study, when there is a sa fety evaluation, the investigator or site staff will be 
responsible for detecting AEs and SAEs as detailed in this section of the protocol.   All AEs will 
be reviewed by a data safety monitor.

humans, whether  or not considered drug related.  
University of New Mexico  Page 28 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a  study medication, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study medication.  Any abnormal laboratory 
value deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_093], regardless of causal relationship, must be 
reported as an AE.  
Examples of an AE include the following:  
• significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication 
under study  
• exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the co ndition (e.g., abnormal physical 
examination finding)  
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study 
medication or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an 
AE or SAE, unless nonserious or serious sequelae occur)  
The following examples are not considered AEs:  
• medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy), although the 
condition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• anticipa ted day to day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) 
(including laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not 
worsen  
• the disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the d isease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with 
a greater frequency than expected for the subject’s condition  
All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, and regardless of 
causality or seriousnes s, will be assessed and recorded on the CRF beginning after administration 
of study medication through the final follow -up assessment.  SAEs will be assessed and recorded 
after administration of study medication through 30 days after study drug administrat ion 
(Sections  8.2 and 8.4). 
8.2 DEFINITION OF A SUSP ECTED ADVERSE REACTI ON 
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR ) is defined as any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257].  ‘Reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between  the drug and the 
adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
University of New Mexico  Page 29 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  8.3 DEFINITION OF A SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENT  OR SUSPECTED 
ADVERSE REACTION  
An SAE  or serious suspected adverse reaction (SSAR)  is defined as any event that meets the 
following criteria:  
• It results in death or is life -threatening (i.e., presents an immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred).  (This criterion is not int ended to include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.)  
• It results in persistent or substantial disability or incapacitation.  (This criterion is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical signific ance, such as 
uncomplicated headache, diarrhea, or sprained ankle.)  
• It results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It results in prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• It requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an AE is serious 
when considering important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but  may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
prevent any of the other outcomes listed.  Examples of such medical events that may also be 
considered serious include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home f or allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from

8.3.1 Serious Adverse Events That Occur Before Administration of Study Medicati on 
Before administration of study medication, only SAEs assessed by [CONTACT_456585] (e.g., related to study procedures or a change in existing therapy) will be 
transcribed onto the SAE reporting form and reported to the data safety monitor .

medication, the i nvestigator is obligated to report the SAE to the data safety monitor . 
University of New Mexico  Page 30 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  8.4 RECORDING AND EVALUA TING ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENTS  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, 
symptoms, or other clinical  information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs or 
symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE.  
8.4.1 Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will assess the  intensity of each AE and SAE re ported during the study .  The 
intensity of eac h AE and SAE recorded on the CRF should be assigned to one of the following 
categories:  
• mild:  an event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and 
does not interfere with everyday activities  
• moderate:  an event that is sufficie ntly discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities  
• severe:  an event that prevents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a term used to 
describe the intensity of a specific  event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  The 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe 
headache).  This is not the same as serious, which is based on the subject’s or event’s outcome or 
on act ion criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or 
functioning (Section  8.2). 
8.4.2 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is oblig ated to use his or her clinical judgment to assess the relationship 
between the study medication and the occurrence of each AE or SAE.  The investigator will 
assess the relationship to the study medication by [CONTACT_88550]:  
• Definitely Related:  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  The 
AE is most likely explained by [CONTACT_5349].  Dechallenge and rechallenge (if possible) 
are positive.  The AE is consistent with a known response to the study drug.   Another 
etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
• Probably Related:  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  The 
AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_137581].  Dechallenge (if 
performed) is positive.  
• Possibly Related:  An AE  has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug.  The 
AE could have been due to another equally likely cause.  Dechallenge is positive.  
• Not Related:  The subject did not receive the study drug OR the AE has no temporal 
relationship to study drug OR t he AE has a much more likely alternate etiology OR 
the AE is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another drug.  
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it is 
important that the investigato r always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
University of New Mexico  Page 31 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  transmitting the SAE reporting form and AE CRF page(s) to the data safety monitor .  The 
causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  Th e investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and amend the SAE reporting form and AE CRF page(s) accordingly.  
8.4.3 Assessment of Outcome  
The investigator will assess the outcome of the event by [CONTACT_137582]:  
• Resolved:  The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae.  An event 
(either serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject 
experienced no restrictions.  For example, if an AE led to surgery that resulted in a 
postoperative wound infection, the infection would not be considered a sequela . 
• Resolved with sequelae:  The event has at least one secondary outcome that may 
result in permanent disability, functional limitation, or both.  Such sequelae are 
usually limited t o SAEs.  For example, if an AE of stroke resulted  in paralysis, or 
emboli formation after a n AE of  bacterial infection resulted  in a renal inf arct and loss 
of renal function, then paralysis and loss of renal function would be considered 
sequelae.  
• Not resol ved:  At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in 
intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values.  Examples include headache, 
low-grade fever, or nausea.  
• Unknown: The status of the event is unknown.  
• Death  
8.[ADDRESS_1222919]’s condition.  All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact [CONTACT_351553].  
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit, until an appropriate 
resolution can be documented.  
SAEs wi ll be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator will ensure that follow -up 
information provided to the data safety monitor  includes results of any a dditional laboratory tests

Study Duration and D ates The duration of this study is 
expected to be approximately 18 
months (10-month subject 
recruitment, up to 3 week screening 
phase,  and 5-month treatment), with 
subject recruitment to start in May

Objectives 
 
Primary Objective: 
 
To examine the effect of the addition of Cycloset upon  glucose  metabolism (glycemic control 
including post prandial glucose  metabolism) in individuals with inade quately controlled (HbA1c 
7.5-10.0) type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who are already  on By[CONTACT_28556] (exenatide once  weekly) or 
Victoza (liraglutide once  daily) as part of their standard care. 
 
 
Seconda ry Objectives: 
 
Since Cycloset has been  shown to reduce  cardiovascu lar events in those  over the age of [ADDRESS_1233148] of Cycloset as add-on 
therapy in adult subjects with T2DM that is inade quately controlled (HbA1c 7.5% to 10.0%) on 
GLP-1 analog therapy with either exenatide (By[CONTACT_28556]) once weekly or liraglutide (Victoza) once

cytokines  and  inflammatory  biomarkers  in  the  peripheral  blood  and  urine,  assess ment  of 
oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in white blood cells isolated from a peripheral whole 
blood sample, a 5-hour mixed meal tolerance test (MMT) for assessment of postprandial glucose 
metabolism and  24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. 
 
Following completion of all the base line studies as above, subjects will be started on Cycloset, 
0.8 mg/day in addition to their stable dose  of By[CONTACT_28556] (exenatide) (2mg/week) or Victoza 
(liraglutide) (1.2-1.8 mg/day), and the dose will be increased  by 0.8 mg/day every week to a 
maximum of 3.2 mg/day, or as  tolerated to a minimum of 2.4 mg/day. 
 
Subjects will return at months 1, 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_1233150] lying down and 
then after standing for 5 minutes at each  of the visits. At month 4, all of the base line studies 
detailed above will be repea ted. 
All   tests   will   be   performed   in   the   Clinical   Resea rch   Center   at   the   [LOCATION_007]   Diabetes 
Institute/University of [LOCATION_007] Health Science  Center, San Antonio. 
 
 
 
Numb er Of Subjects 
 
Planned  enrollment = [ADDRESS_1233151] Characteristics at Enroll ment 
 
 
T2DM male or female subjects between the ages of 30 and 70 years with HbA1c between 7.5- 
10% on a diabetes therapeutic regimen consisting of stable doses  of either exenatide (2 
mg/week) or liraglutide (1.2-1.8 mg/day) for at least 90 days prior to enrollment with or without 
metformin and/or pi[INVESTIGATOR_881877]. 
 
 
Study Treatments 
 
Cycloset, 0.8 mg/day, with the dose  increased  by 0.8 mg/day every week to a maximum of 3.2 
mg/day, or as tolerated to a minimum dose  of 2.4 mg/day, added  on to usual  diabetes therapy 
cons isting of a stable dose  for at least 90 days of exenatide (2mg/week)  or liraglutide (1.2-1.8 
mg/day). Subjects must be on either exenatide or liraglutide as part of their standa rd care to be 
eligible for study participation. 
 
 
Study Endpo ints 
 
The primary endpo int is the effect of Cycloset on glycemic control and postprandial glucose 
metabolism.

Veroscience – Confid ential Page 7 30  April  2015  
  
 
 
 
 
Seconda ry endpo ints include the effects of Cycloset on endo thelial function, aortic compliance ,, 
body  weight composition, blood pressure and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. 
 
 
 
 
Statistical Procedures 
Sample Size Calculation: Assuming that Cycloset will cause  a 0.6% reduc tion in HbA1c, we 
computed that 15 subjects provide 90% power to detect a 0.6% decrease from a baseline HbA1c 
of 8.0 ±0.5% at an alpha of 0.05. 
 
A statistical ana lysis plan (SAP), providing details of the analyses and presentation structure of 
the results, will be developed  and finalized before the database  is locked.

A.  Summary  
 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common metabolic cardiovascu lar disorder cha racterized 
by [CONTACT_881886] (1). Quick release  bromocriptine (Cycloset), a D2- 
dopa mine receptor agonist sympatholytic agent, was approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food  and Drug 
Administration in 2009  for use as monotherapy and in combination with oral antidiabetic agents 
for the treatment of T2DM (2) in those with T2DM over the age of 18. In humans, Cycloset 
reduces  the postprandial glucose  excursion without augmenting insulin secretion or improving 
insulin sens itivity in muscle (3,4). These  results suggest that Cycloset enhances  hepa tic 
sens itivity to insulin, perhaps by [CONTACT_881887], and are cons istent with 
results obtained in rodents (5). 
 
The glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 recep tor agonists, liraglutide and exenatide, also reduce 
postprandial, as well as fasting, hyperglycemia following glucose  ingestion (6,7). The reduc tion in 
postprandial hyperglycemia results from a delay in gastric emptying and enhanced  supp ression 
of hepatic glucose  production second ary to increased insulin secretion and decreased  glucagon 
secretion (6,8). To date, no study in man has examined combination therapy with a GLP-[ADDRESS_1233157], a 
synergistic interaction between bromocriptine and exenatide has been  demonstrated in the 
glucose  intolerant, insulin resistant Syrian hamster (9). 
 
In the present study we will examine the effect of the addition of Cycloset therapy to inadequately 
controlled (HbA1c  7.5-10.0) T2DM patients on exenatide (By[CONTACT_28556]) once weekly or liraglutide 
(Victoza). Since Cycloset has been  shown to reduce cardiovascu lar events in adults with T2DM 
(10), a beneficial effect that maybe assoc iated with improved endo thelial/vascu lar function, we 
also will measu re endothelial function using the Endo-PAT instrument and assess  aortic 
compliance  using non-invasive hemodynamic testing.

B.  Detailed Background  
 
Cycloset is a dopamine recep tor agonist indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  Cycloset reduces  glucose 
following each  meal without raising plasma insulin levels.  As such, Cycloset may be acting as a 
postprandial insulin sensitizer and/or glucose  regulator (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_881878] 200 0) to reduce  postprandial 
hyperglycemia and may be expected to synergize with incretin mimetics that increase 
postprandial insulin levels. 
 
Available evidence  indicates that Cycloset improves glycemic control in patients with type [ADDRESS_1233161] without increasing plasma insulin levels in type 2 diabetes subjects (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_881878] 200 0). 
The selective effect of timed bromocriptine treatment on  postprandial versus post-absorptive 
glucose  metabolism is exemplified by [CONTACT_881888] a hyperglycemic versus euglycemic insulin clamp (Ezrokhi et al, 2008). 
 
In clinical studies, Cycloset therapy has been  shown to reduce  postprandial glucose  levels across 
the three standa rd meals of the day without increasing plasma insulin levels when used a lone or 
in combination with sulfonylurea therapy (Cincotta et al, 199 9). Among patients with type 
2 diabetes failing sulfonylurea therapy (two identically designed studies with; n= 494; base line 
HbA1c of 9,3), the addition of Cycloset as compared to placebo  resulted in reduc tions in post 
prandial glucose  after 24  weeks of treatment (Cincotta 1999 ). 
 
Post prandial glucose  exursions contribute to the excessive morbidity associated with type 2 
diabetes (Ceriello, 2008 ). The mechan ism by  [CONTACT_881889], adipose  lipolysis, and glucose  disposal in liver and muscle. Under 
normal conditions, in response  to a meal, fuel sensing neurons in the hypothalamus act via the 
neuroendoc rine axis to improve insulin sens itivity in liver, adipose, and  muscle after a meal to 
reduce  hepatic glucose  output and adipose  lipolysis, and to increase  glucose  disposal in liver and 
muscle.  However, in insulin resistant states like T2DM, this fuel sens ing mechan ism is altered 
and no longer sends  these meal-induced  insulin sens itizing signals to the periphery but

rathersends  signals that tend to oppose  insulin action, and postprandial dysglycemia ensues  
(Cincotta 2002, Luo  et al 2008 ). 
 
One of the actions of the incretin mimetics such  as the GLP-1 analogs is to stimulate pos tprandial 
beta cell insulin secretory response  to plasma glucose  (see drug labeling information; 
www.fda.gov).  Thus the combination of Cycloset that is working as a post prandial insulin 
sens tizier  with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_881879].  As described above, Cycloset has been  shown to 
reduce  postprandial glucose levels when used  in combination with insulin secretagoues. In 
animal models of insulin resistance, the combination of bromocriptine  and a GLP-[ADDRESS_1233162] of chronic (2 
week) bromocriptine treatment on glucose  tolerant/insulin resistant an imals that were 
administered a GLP-[ADDRESS_1233163] (GTT) was assessed  in a [ADDRESS_1233164] prior to the initiation of the GTT. The combination of timed bromocriptine 
plus a GLP-1 analog produced  marked improvement in the GTT of severely glucose  intolerant 
hamsters, to an extent much greater than the sum of either therapy (Ezrokhi 2012 ). 
 
Therefore, bo th a mechanistic rationale and empi[INVESTIGATOR_10477] e xperimental evidence  implicate a 
beneficial interaction between bromocriptine and the incretin mimetics (GLP-1 analogs) upon 
postprandial hyperglycemia in insulin resistant s tates. To date, however, no such  studies 
investigating the interactive effects of a GLP-1 analog and Bromocriptine-QR (Cycloset) have 
been  condu cted in humans..

At Visit 3 subjects will be started on Cycloset, 0.8 mg/day in addition to their stable dose  of 
By[CONTACT_28556] (exenatide) (2mg/week) or Victoza (liraglutide) (1.2-1.8 mg/day). Subjects will receive 
their first dose  of Cycloset in the CRC and will be monitored for one hour after the dose  before 
being sent home.  The Cycloset dose  will then be increased  by 0.8 mg/day every week to a 
maximum of 3.2 mg/day, or as tolerated to a minimum of 2.4 mg/day.   During the Cycloset 
titration phase  subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_881890]. Subjects who 
cannot tolerate at least 2.4 mg/day of Cycloset will be replaced. 
 
 
Subjects will return at months 1, 2, 3, (Visits 4, 5 and  6) for interim medical history, body  weight, 
HbA1c, and FPG. At month 4 (End of Study Visits 7 and 8), all of the tests performed at Baseline 
Visits 1-3, including non-invasive hemodynamic testing for assessment of aortic compliance, 
DXA for assessment of body  weight composition, Endo-PAT tests for assessment of endo thelial 
function, MMT test, collection of blood samples for measurement of inflammatory/ oxidative 
stress markers and isolation of white blood cells, 24-hour ambulatory BP recording and collection 
of a 24-hour urine sa mple will be repea ted as  desc ribed abo ve. Cycloset administration will be 
discon tinued  at the completion of Visit 8. 
 
Two weeks after Cycloset administration is discon tinued  subjects will return for Visit [ADDRESS_1233170] endothelium-mediated changes in the digital pulse 
waveform known as the PAT ( Peripheral Arterial Tone) signal. Blood pressure cuff is then

with two arm-supp orters along each  of the patient's sides to suppo rt the patient’s arm. The index

different digit (except the thumb) may be used,  as long as the same finger is used  on both hand s. 
Blood pressu re will be measu red using the control arm (the arm that is not  occluded  during the 
Endo-PAT study. A sec ond blood pressure cuff will be placed  on the arm to be occluded  during 
the Endo-PAT study. The Endo-PAT device will be employed and the blood pressu re cuff will be 
inflated at that time. During the procedu re the patient will be asked to refrain from moving the 
fingers, as this will create mechan ical artifacts. It is important for the pa tient to be relaxed 
throughout the study. During the test and while the arm cuff is inflated, subjects may feel some 
discomfort, numbnes s, or tingling. In case  of incomplete occlusion the cuff may be  inflated to a 
maximum of 300 mmHg. The measurement will be taken for 5 minutes. During that time, the 
blood pressu re cuff will be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_32269] a supra-systolic pressure of 60 mmHg above the 
patient's systolic pressure or [ADDRESS_1233172] and pre occlusion values. These  values are normalized to measu rements from the 
contra-lateral arm, which serves as control for non-endo thelial dependent  systemic effects. The 
techn ique provides values for the calculation of a Reactive Hyperemia Index  (RHI), which gives 
an indication of the endothelial vasod ilator function. The RHI, in turn, correlates with the 
measu rement of endothelial vasod ilator function in the coronary arteries and thus predicts the 
potential unfavorable cardiovascu lar cond itions and outcomes. 
 
 
Noninvasive Hemodynamic Assessment  of Aortic Compliance  
 
Subjects will be rested in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] [ADDRESS_1233173] velocity (PWV) will then be taken immediately after measu rement of brachial 
blood pressure. PWV is determined by [CONTACT_881892]. This is a completely noninvasive procedu re using previously 
desc ribed and published  techn iques (Circulation 2006; 113: 1213 -1225 ). The  surface distance 
from suprasternal n otch to the distal (femoral) recording site is measu red, and  the pressure wave 
transit time is calculated using a foot-of-the-wave to foot- of-the-wave method. PWV is calculated 
by [CONTACT_881893].  Data are 
collected by a single trained obse rver, and  the mean of at least [ADDRESS_1233174] (MMT) 
Following a 10-[ADDRESS_1233175], catheters will be placed  in the antecub ital vein or hand 
vein, one for infusion of tritiated glucose  and one for blood withdrawal. At -180 minutes base line 
blood samples (see attached flow shee t) will be obtained and a prime (40 uCi x FPG/100) – 
continuous  (0.40 uCi/min) will be started. Blood samples for determination of plasma, glucos e, 
insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, FFA, glucagon-like pep tide-1, and glucose -dependent  insulinotropic 
polypeptide and tritiated glucose  and 14C-glucose radioactivity will be obtained at -180, -30, -20, 
-10, and [ADDRESS_1233176] a mixed meal (75 grams of glucose,  25 
grams of fat, 20 grams of protein, 600 kcal) over 15-20 minutes. The glucose will be labeled with

100 uCi of 1-14C-glucose. Plasma samples for subs trates, hormones, and radioactivity will be 
obtained every 15 minutes for 5 hours. Plasma samples for ca techo lamines (CA) will be collected 
at – 10, 0, 60, 120, and  240 minutes. 
 
Meal tolerance  will be determined by [CONTACT_881894] (trapezoidal rule) during the 
MTT. Insulin secretion will be calculated as I0-300/G0-300, CP0-300/G0-300, and ISR0-300/G0- 
300, where ISR = insulin secretary rate (decon volution of the plasma C-peptide curve). Beta cell 
function (11) will be calculated as the insulin secretion/insulin resistance (dispos ition) index: 
ISR0-300/G0-300  x  Matsuda  Index  of  insulin  sens itivity  (12).  The  same  measures  will  be 
examined for the following time intervals: -10, 0, 0-60, 0 -120, 0-180, and  0-240. 
During the fasting postabsorptive state, the rate of HGP equals the rate of glucose  uptake by [CONTACT_881895] (DPM/min) divided by 
[CONTACT_881896] (DPM/mg). Following meal ingestion, non-steady 
state cond itions prevail and the rates of total (RaT) and oral (RaO) glucose  appea rance  in the 
systemic circulation are calculated using Steele’s equation from the 14C-glucose  and 3H-glucose 
spec ific activities, respectively, as previously described (13). The difference between RaT and 
RaO yields the rate of endogenous  HGP. Subtraction of RaO from 75 grams (ingested glucose 
load) gives the splanchn ic (primarily reflects) glucose uptake. 
 
Dual-Energy  X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) 
 
After an  overnight fast, a DXA scan  for body  composition scan  will be performed using a Hologic 
DXA scann er.  Subjects will be resting comfortably in supi[INVESTIGATOR_33197] a quiet room and the 
entire body  will be scanned.  The acquired images will be integrated and analyzed by a software 
IBM computer program and total amount of fat and fat-free mass and total body  water will be 
estimated. Total and  regional fat and fat-free mass will be measured by a licensed  radiology 
techn ician using a Discovery 010-[ADDRESS_1233177] recruitment

7.3   METHODS  
 
Data will be collected relating to primary and seconda ry efficacy variables and safety. 
 
A local laboratory will be utilized for collection and analysis of the laboratory tests assoc iated with 
efficacy, and safety. Standa rdized guidelines for preparation, collection, and centralized analysis 
of blood and urine spec imens will provide uniformity of the data and will avoid potential inter – 
laboratory variability due to incons istent methodo logy. 
 
 
7.3.1 Primary efficacy  data will be:  Change from baseline in HbA1c and change from 
base line in postprandial glucose  metabolism. 
 
 
 
7.3.2 Seconda ry efficacy  data: Change from base line in endo thelial function, aortic 
compliance,  body weight composition, b lood pressure and oxidative stress/inflammatory 
markers.

7.3.3   Safety Data 
 
Safety will be assessed  on the basis of an analysis of hypoglycemia events, adverse events, 
clinical chemistry, clinical hematology and  clinical values; physical examination weight, and vital 
signs. 
 
Occurrence  of hypo glycemia 
 
The general symptoms of hypoglycemia most subjects experience  include one or more of the 
following: headache,  dizziness,  general feeling of weakness,  drowsiness,  confusion, paleness, 
irritability, trembling, sweating, rapid heartbeat and a cold, clammy feeling. In severe cases 
seizure, loss of consciousness  and even lapse  into coma can occu r. 
 
Definitions of hypoglycemia events that must be  recorded on the CRF hypoglycemia page: 
 
• Severe hypoglycemia - in which the assistance  of another party is required (not merely 
requested), and  either: 
 
• a recorded self monitored blood glucose  of <36 mg/dL, or 
. 
• there was treatment with oral carbohydrates, intravenous  glucose  or glucagons 
and there was prompt response  to that therapy. 
 
For further clarification, the definition for severe hypoglycemia included  all epi[INVESTIGATOR_881883]-treatment and which 
were thus thought to place subjects at risk for injury to themselves or others. Requires 
assistance  means  that the subject could not help her/himself. Someone be ing kind that 
assists the subject when not nece ssary does  not qualify as “ assistance  required”. 
 
• Mild to modera te documented hypoglycemia – events not cons idered severe (by [CONTACT_881900]) but with SMBG < 70 mg/dl. 
 
• Hypoglycemia  symptoms  with  or  without  SMBG  values  that  accord ing  to  the 
Investigator represent true hypoglycemia 
 
Symptoms cons istent with an adrenergic surge, such  as those  observed during 
hypoglycemia (headach e, dizziness,  general feeling of weakness, drowsiness,  confusion, 
paleness,  irritability, trembling, sweating, rapid heartbeat and/or a cold clammy feeling), 
but with a docu mented SMBG >70 mg/dL or no recorded SMBG value, are to be recorded 
on the hypoglycemia event page, if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]/study coo rdinator, 
they represent true hypoglycemia. 
 
The following hypoglycemia events are considered serious adverse event (SAEs): 
 
A hypoglycemia event associated with: 
 
• Coma/loss of consc iousness (“hypoglycemia coma”) or 
 
• Hypoglycemia seizure/convulsion (“hypoglycemia seizure”). 
Clinical Study Protocol: Effect of Cycloset on Glycemic Control In Type 2 Diabetic Patients Inade quately Controlled on 
GLP-1 Analogue Therapy 
Veroscience – Confid ential Page [ADDRESS_1233192] the following variables for events susp ected of being 
hypoglycemia: date and time started, whether the event occu rred after the subject went to bed 
and prior to waking, whether the event was assoc iated with symptoms, whether assistance  was 
required, and if so, whether there was prompt recovery after oral CHO, glucagon, or intravenous 
(IV) glucose  was used,  SMBG value with assoc iated date and time, any spec ial circumstances 
(e.g. exercise), date and time of last meal, and date and time of last dose of long-acting and/or 
rapid-acting insulin. The study coordinator will review the diaries with the subject at e very visit. 
 
Adverse  Events 
 
AE monitoring will be conduc ted at all study visits, as well as, all titration contacts. (Please  refer 
to Section 8 for add itional information regarding AEs.) 
 
 
8   ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
8.1   DEFINITIONS  
 
 
8.1.1   Adverse  Event 
 
The term  adverse event covers any unfavorable and unintended  sign, symptom, syndrome, or 
illness  that develops or worsens  during the period of obse rvation in the clinical study.  Clinically 
relevant abno rmal results of diagnostic procedu res including abno rmal laboratory findings (e.g., 
requiring unschedu led diagnostic proced ures or treatment measures, or resulting in withdrawal 
from the study) are considered to be adverse events. 
 
Worsening of a sign or symptom of the cond ition under  treatment will normally be measu red by 
[CONTACT_575331].  However, if the outcome fulfills the definition of “serious adverse event”, it 
must be  recorded as such (see Section 8.1.2). 
 
The adverse event may be: 
 
• A new  illness  
 
• Worsening of a conc omitant illness  
 
• An effect of the study medication, including comparator 
 
• A combination of two or more of these  factors 
 
No causal  relationsh ip with the study medication or  with the clinical study itself is implied by [CONTACT_816400] “adverse event”. 
 
Adverse events fall into the categories “non-serious” and “serious” (see Section 8.1.2). 
 
Surgical proced ures themselves are not adverse events; they are therapeu tic measu res for 
Clinical Study Protocol: Effect of Cycloset on Glycemic Control In Type 2 Diabetic Patients Inade quately Controlled on 
GLP-1 Analogue Therapy 
Veroscience – Confid ential Page 29 30 April 2015  
  
 
 
cond itions that require surgery.  The cond ition for which the surgery is required is an adverse 
event, if it occu rs or is detected during the study pe riod. Planned  surgical measu res pe rmitted by 
[CONTACT_881901](s) leading to these  measu res are not adverse events, 
if the cond ition(s) was (were) known before the start of study treatment.  In the latter case  the 
cond ition shou ld be reported as medical h istory. 
 
Hypoglycemia events will be cap tured on a spec ific hypoglycemia CRF page and shou ld 
not be cons idered an ad verse event unless c lassified as a ser ious AE (see Section 7 .3.3). 
There fore, hypoglycemic events not classified, as serious adverse events do not need  to 
be entered  on the adverse event CRF page. 
 
 
8.1.2   Serious Adverse Event 
 
A serious adverse event is one that at any  dose  (including overdose ): 
 
• Results in death 
 
1 • Is life-threatening 
 
• Requires in subject hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
2 • Results in persistent or significant d isability or incapac ity 
 
• Is a congenital an omaly or birth defect 
3 • Is an important medical event 
 
1 
“Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
serious adverse event; it does  not refer to a serious adverse event that hypo thetically might have 
caused  death if it were more severe. 
 
2 
“Persistent or significant disability or incapac ity” means  that there is a subs tantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 
 
[ADDRESS_1233193] of Critical Terms ([ADDRESS_1233194], provided in the “Instructions for completing the 
‘Serious  Adverse  Event/Expedited  Report  from  a  Clinical  Trial’  form”)  shou ld  be  used  as 
guidance  for  adverse  events  that  may  be  cons idered  serious  because  they  are  medically 
important. 
 
Clarification    of    the    difference    in    meaning    between    “severe”    and    “serious” 
The term “severe” is often used  to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
Clinical Study Protocol: Effect of Cycloset on Glycemic Control In Type 2 Diabetic Patients Inade quately Controlled on 
GLP-1 Analogue Therapy 
Veroscience – Confid ential Page 30 30 April 2015  
  
 
 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance  (such as severe headache ).   This is not the same as “serious”, which is 
based  on the outcome or ac tion criteria usua lly associated with events that pose  a threat to life or 
functioning.   Seriousn ess (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations. 
 
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1233195] to reporting as alert terms in this study. 
 
However, cases  in which a “significant overdose”  of the investigational product  was taken and a 
non-serious adverse event or no adverse event occu rred are to be reported to the sponsor  in an 
expedited manner on  a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial” form. 
 
In a context of this protocol, an overdose  of study insulin shou ld be reported only if the subject 
administered a significant larger than prescribed dose  of insulin. The definition of a “significant 
overdose”  of study insulin will be based  on clinical judgment and will be at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
 
In addition, any pregnancy diagnosed  in a female subject or in the female partner of a male 
subject during treatment with the investigational p roduct  must be reported to the spon sor 
immediately.   Information related to the pregnancy must be given on a “Drug Exposu re Via 
Parent – Data Collection” form that will be provided by [CONTACT_78265] r. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_1233196] the spons or to determine how the adverse event shou ld be documented and reported. 
 
8.3 DOCU MENTATION  AND R EPORTING  OF ADVERSE EVENTS BY 
[CONTACT_881902] (see Section 8.2) 
must be docu mented on the pages provided in the case report form in acco rdance  with the 
instructions for the completion of adverse event reports in clinical studies.  These  instructions are 
provided in the investigator’s study file and in the case  report form itself. 
 
The following approach  will be taken  for docu mentation: 
 
• All adverse events (whether serious or non-serious, or considered as an alert term) must be 
documented  on the “Adverse Event” page of the  case report form. 
 
• If the adverse event is serious (see Section 8.1.2), the investigator must complete, in addition to 
the “Adverse Event” page in the case report form, a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report 
from a Clinical Trial” form at the time the serious adverse event is detected. 
Clinical Study Protocol: Effect of Cycloset on Glycemic Control In Type 2 Diabetic Patients Inade quately Controlled on 
GLP-1 Analogue Therapy 
Veroscience – Confid ential Page 31 30 April 2015  
  
 
 
• This form must be comp leted and faxed  to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department 
within 24 hours. 
 
• If the adverse event is listed as an alert term (see Section 8.1.3) even if the “alert term” is non- 
serious, the investigator must complete, in addition to the “Adverse Event” page in the case report 
form, a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial” form at the time the 
adverse event is detected. 
 
• This form must be comp leted and faxed  to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department 
within 24 hours. 
 
• When a “significant overdose” of the investigational product occurs without an adverse event or in 
other  situations where the sponsor requires an expedited report without an adverse event (see 
Section 8.1.3), the investigator should only complete a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report 
from a Clinical Trial” form.   Instructions on where to send  this form will be provided by [CONTACT_3604] r.  In this case,  there is no need to complete the “Adverse Event” page in the case 
report form. 
 
Every attempt shou ld be made to desc ribe the adverse event in terms of a diagnosis.  If a clear 
diagnosis has been made, individual signs and s ymptoms will not  be recorded un less they 
represent atypi[INVESTIGATOR_881884] d iagnosis, in which case they shou ld be 
reported as sepa rate events. If a clear diagnosis cannot  be established, each  sign and symptom 
must be  recorded individually. 
 
All subjects who have adverse events, whether cons idered assoc iated with the use of the 
investigational products or not, must be monitored to determine the ou tcome.  The clinical course 
of the adverse event will be followed up acco rding to acce pted standards of medical practice, 
even after the end of the period of obse rvation, until a satisfactory explanation is found or the 
investigator considers it medically justifiable to terminate follow-up. Should the adverse event 
result in death, a full pathologist’s report shou ld be supp lied, if poss ible. 
 
All questions on the completion and supp ly of adverse event report forms and  any further forms 
issued  to the investigator at a later date to clarify unresolved issues  shou ld be addressed  to the 
sponso r. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.4   IMMEDIATE REPORTING BY [CONTACT_881903] a reason  for expedited reporting to 
Pharmacovigilance  (alert term and/or “significant overdose ”, as defined in Section 8.1.3) must be 
docu mented on a “Serious Adverse Event/Exped ited Report from a Clinical Trial” form in 
acco rdance  with the “Instructions for completing the ‘Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report 
from a Clinical Trial’ form”. 
 
• This form must be comp leted and faxed  to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department 
within 24 hours.

GLP-1 Analogue Therapy 
Veroscience – Confid ential Page 32 30 April 2015  
  
 
 
The “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial” form and  the instructions are 
provided in the investigator’s study file. The sponsor  will ensu re that all legal reporting 
requirements are met. 
 
The initial report must be as complete as poss ible, including details of the current illness  and 
(serious) adverse event, and an assess ment of the causal  relationsh ip between the event and 
the investigational p roduct(s). 
 
Information not a vailable at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or 
laboratory  values  received  after  the  report)  must  be  docu mented  on  a  follow-up  “Serious 
Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical Trial” form. 
 
The “Instructions for completing the ‘Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a Clinical 
Trial’ form” give more detailed guidance  on the reporting of serious adverse events, adverse 
events that comply with alert terms, and adverse events initially reported as non-serious that 
beco me serious.  In the latter situation, when a non -serious e vent beco mes se rious, details must 
be forwarded immediately to the spons or on a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a 
Clinical Trial” form.

9   WITHDRAWALS 
 
9.1   WITHD RAWAL OF SUBJECTS 
 
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study (i.e. from any further study medication or study 
procedu re) for the following reason s: 
 
• At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative* 
 
• If, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation in the study would be detrimental to the 
subject's well-being 
 
• At the spec ific request of the sponsor  
 
* “Legally au thorized represen tative” means an individual or judicial or other body au thorized 
under  applicable law to consent  on beha lf of a prospec tive subject to the subject’s participation in 
the procedu re(s) involved in the research. 
 
Subjects must be  withdrawn from the investigational p roduct under  the following circumstance s: 
 
• Women who beco me pregnant 
 
• Women  of  childbea ring  potential  who  discon tinue  contracep tion  with the  intention  of 
beco ming pregnant. 
 
In all cases,  the reason  for and date of withdrawal must be recorded in the case  report form and 
in the subject's medical records.   The subject must be followed up to establish whether the 
reason  was  an  adverse  event,  and,  if  so,  this  must  be  reported  in  acco rdance  with  the 
procedu res in Section 8. 
 
The investigator must make every effort to contact [CONTACT_449367]-up.  Attempts to contact 
[CONTACT_881904]’s records (e.g., times and dates of attempted 
telephone  contact, receipt for send ing a registered letter). 
 
Subject withdrawal due to deterioration of glycemic control 
 
Subjects with 2 conse cutive fasting blood glucose values >275 mg/dl after completion of the 
study d rug titration phase will be evaluated for withdrawal and initiation of rescue therapy at  the 
discretion of the study investigators. Subjects that are withdrawn will be referred to their primary 
care physician or endoc rinologist for further d iabetes medication adjustments as neede d. 
 
Replacement of sub jects 
 
Subjects that are withdrawn within <[ADDRESS_1233197] 2 months on a stable 
dose  of the study drug following the study drug titration phase  but are unable to complete the 
final study day proced ures will also be replaced.

10 STATISTICAL PROCEDUR ES 
 
10.1 ANALYSIS VARIABLES 
 
A statistical ana lysis plan (SAP), providing details of the analyses and presentation structure of 
the results, will be developed  and finalized before the database  is locked. 
 
 
 
 
10.2 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
 
 
 
 
Samples from all patients who complete the clinical study period will be assa yed. 
Dropou ts will be replaced as described in section 9.1. 
 
 
10.3 SAMPLE SIZE 
 
 
Assuming that Cycloset will cause  a 0.6% reduc tion in HbA1c, 15  subjects would provide 90% 
power to detect a 0.6% decrease  from a base line HbA1c of 8.0 ±0.5% at an alpha of 0.05.

(e.g., laboratory report), it must be ob literated on the copy of the document to be supp lied to the 
sponso r.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in acco rdance  with local data 
protection laws.  The subjects will be informed that represen tatives of the sponso r, independent 
ethics committee (IEC)/ institutional review board (IRB), or regulatory authorities may inspect 
their medical records to verify the information collected, and that all personal information made 
available for inspec tion will be hand led in strictest confidence  and in accordance  with local data 
protection laws. 
 
The investigator will maintain a personal sub ject identification list (subject numbers with the 
correspond ing subject names) to enab le records to be identified. 
 
11.5 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENTS 
 
Neither the investigator nor the sponsor  will alter this clinical study p rotocol without obtaining the 
written agreement of the other.  Once the study has started, amendments shou ld be made only in 
exceptional cases.  The chan ges then become part of the clinical study protocol. 
 
11.6 APPROVAL OF THE  CLINI CAL STUDY  PROTOCOL  AND AMENDMENTS 
 
Before the start of the study, the clinical study protocol, informed consent document, and any 
other appropriate docu ments will be submitted to the IEC/IRB with a cover letter or a form listing 
the documents sub mitted, their dates of issue,  and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as 
applicable) for which approval is sought.  If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to 
the authorities, in accordance  with local legal requirements.

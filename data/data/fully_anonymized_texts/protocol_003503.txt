10/Protocol CP40563 , Version 1Study Design
Description of Study
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, active -controlled (i.e., oseltamivir) study to 
assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy  of baloxavir marboxil compared with 
oseltamivir in pediatric patients 1 to  12 years of age with influenza -like sy mptoms.  
The approved dose for oseltamivir in pediatric patients 1 to 12 years of age is twice daily ( BID)
for 5 days, based on body weight.  Baloxavir marboxil will be given as a single -dose, based on
body  weight at screenin g.  Either drug, along with the corresponding placebo of its comparator 
in this trial, will be started at the time of randomization.
Patients will be screened and randomized on Day 1 and assigned in a 2:1 ratio to rece ive a 
single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil based on body weight (2mg/kg for patients weighing 
20kg or 40 mg for patients weighing 20 kg) or oseltamivir (dose based on body weight ) for 
5days. Re-screening of patients who fail to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will not be 
permitted for the same illness epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].
The study consists of two periods:  a 5-daytreatment period (man datory visits on Days 1, 2, 
and4) and a 24- day safety follow -up peri od(mandatory visits on Days 6, 10, and 29).  
Therefore, the total study duration for each patient will be 29 day s.
During the 5 -day treatment period, each patient randomized to baloxavir marboxil will receive 
the oseltamivir matching placebo BID for 5 days, and those patients randomized to oseltamivi r 
will receive one dose of baloxavir marboxil matching placebo on Day 1.
The following assessments will be conducted at clinic visits:  physical examination, vital signs, 
adverse events, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], clinical laboratory tests, and nasal/throat sw abs.  
Throughout the treatment and safety follow -up periods, the parents/ caregivers will maintain a
patient diaryfor each patient in order to record body  temperature s(tympanic assessment) ,
influenza sy mptoms, and acetaminophen use .  Temperatures will be recorded four times daily 
(morning, noon, evening, and bedtime) onDays 1 to 3; BID(morning and evening) onDays4 to 
9; and once daily onDays10 to 15.  Influenza sy mptoms will be recorded BID(morning and 
evening) on Day s1 to 9 and once daily on Days 10 to 15.
This study will be conducted at sites inthe [LOCATION_002] and globally .  
To facilitate early and close monitoring of safety parameters over time, an Internal Monitoring 
Committee (IMC) will review aggregate safety data on an ongoing basis as defined in the IMC 
charter. If there is any concern noted in the safety parameters, the Sponsor may suspend or 
discontinue a treatment arm or the entire study, as appropriate.
Number of Patients
This study is designed to enroll approximately 120otherwise healthy male and female pediatric 
patients with influenza -likesymptoms presenting within 48 hours o f symptom onset .
Patients will be recruited in parallel to the following two cohorts:
5 to  12 years of age (minimum 40 patients)
1 to  5 years of age (minimum 20 patients)

Statistical Methods
Primary A nalysis
The safety  analysis population will be used for all analyses . 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
12/Protocol CP40563 , Version 1All verbatim adverse event terms will be mapped to MedDRA thesaurus terms, and adverse 
event severity will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Ve rsion 5.0 ( NCI CTCAE v 5.0).
The safety  of baloxavir marboxil will be evaluated from adverse event s, vital sign measurements ,
and clinical laboratory tests.   Safety parameters will be summarized or listed for the safety 
population.
Determination of Sample S ize  
No formal sample -size calculations have been performed.  Approximately 120pediatric patients 
(80patients in the baloxavir marboxil treatment group and 40 patients in the oseltamivir 
treatment group) will be enrolled.
Interim A nalyses
An interim pharmacokinetic ( PK)analy sis is planned in this study. The PK samples ,up to and 
including Visit 4/[ADDRESS_375988] sample collected and data review is estimated to 
be approximately 2 to 3 weeks and recruitment will continue during this time. Data review of 
blinded PK samples (dummy ID) will be performed by [CONTACT_307161] .
No other interim analyses are planned in this s tudy.  However, given there is no formal 
statistical hypothesis testing in this study, the Sponsor may  choose to conduct up to two interim 
analyses.  The decision to conduct an optional interim analysis and the timing of the a nalysis 
will be documented in the Sponsor’s trial master file prior to the conduct of the interim analysis.  
The interim analysis would be performed and interpreted by [CONTACT_307162].  Access t o treatment assignment 
information would follow the Sponsor’s standard procedures.

period of 1 to 4 days, characterized by [CONTACT_307163], cough, fatigue , 
headache ,and myalgia . Annual influenza epi[INVESTIGATOR_307145] 
3to5million cases of severe illness ,and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths every 
year around the world ( WHO 2018 ).
Although the condition is usually self -limiting in healthy adults , it can be associated with 
substantial morbidity and occasional mortality in children, the elderly ,and the 
immunocompromised (Paules and Subbarao 2017 ).Children play a central role in the 
dissemination of influenza in the community by [CONTACT_307164]. In addition to the acute illness, young 
children are at particular risk of secondary bacterial infections . Children develop more 
severe disease compared with adults, with higher hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307146] 5 years (Rotrosen and Neuzil 2017 ). 
The influenza viruses have a segmented, negative -sense, single- stranded, 
lipid-encapsulated R NA genome; they range between 80 and 100 nm in size. Subtypes 
are defined according to glycoproteins present in the viral lipid coat. The hemagglutinin 
complex (HA) is the major surface protein of the virus. The neuraminidase (NA) proteins 
are the secon d major surface proteins in the virion and play a role in enhancing virus 
penetration of the mucus layer around the target cell and in release of virus from the cell 
surface. The matrix-2 (M2)protein triggers the disintegration of the virion during virus
entry into the cell and may also be involved in protecting the HA prior to assembly of 
new virus particles.
The following anti -influenza virus drugs are currently available in different countries:  the 
M2 ion -channel inhibitors (i.e., amantadine and riman tadine) ( CDC 2011 ), the 
RNA -polymerase inhibitor favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654], and the NA inhibitors (i.e., oseltamivir, zanamivir, 
peramivir, and laninamivir).  Many cases of seasonal influenza infection are resistant to 
amantadine and rimantadine, hence their use in clin ical practice is limited.  NA inhibitors 
are the mainstay of treatment for influenza infections, but their oral formulations need to 
be administered for [ADDRESS_375991] these

1.2 BACKGROUND ON BALOXA VIR MARBOXIL 
Baloxavir marboxil is a compound discovered by [CONTACT_269516] & Co., Ltd. that exerts antiviral 
effects against influenza.  Baloxavir marboxil (also referred to as S -033188, Shionogi 
Compound Identification Number ) is a pro -drug thatis converted to an active form 
(S-033447) in the blood, liver, and small intestine through a metabolic process called 
hydrolysis .
Baloxavir marboxil acts on cap -dependent endonuclease, an enzyme specific to 
influenza viruses, and inhibits viral cap -snatching, thereby [CONTACT_307165].
Detailed profiles of baloxavir marboxil and its active form, S -033447 ,derived from 
non-clinical and Phase I studi es are provided in the Baloxavir Marboxil I nvestigator’s 
Brochure.  To date, one Phase II study and two Phase III studies (one in adults and one 
in pediatric patient s)have been completed and are sum marized below.  A further 
Phase III study in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years) with influenza at high risk of 
influenza complications is currently in progress and is not further discussed in this 
protocol.
1.2.1 Phase II Proof -of-Concept and Dose -Finding Study 
(Study 1518T0821)
In this Phase II study, the efficacy and safety of baloxavir marboxil in patients with 
influenza virus infection were investigated.  A single dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg baloxavir 
marboxil or placebo was administered to a total of 400 patients with influenza virus 
infection (100 patients per dose group).
The median times to allevia tion of influenza symptoms in the 10 -mg, 20-mg, and 40 -mg
group were 54.2, 51.0 ,and 49.5 hours, respectively, compared with 77.7 hours in the 
placebo group. Of the secondary endpoi nts, the median times to resolution of fever in 
the 10 -mg, 20 -mg, and 40 -mg groups were 33.4, 31.6 ,and28.9 hours, respectively, 
compared with 45.3 hours in the placebo group. 
All of the baloxavir marboxil groups showed a significantly greater reduction compared 
with the placebo group in the proportion of patients with positive influenza virus titer, 
change in influenza virus titer, and change in amount of influenza virus on Days 2 and 3 
using the predefined secondary analysis methods.
No deaths or seriou s adverse event s were reported in any of the groups. Adverse 
event s were reported in 27 of 100 patients (34 events) in the 10 -mg group, 23 of 
100patients (29 events) in the 20 -mg group, and 26 of 100 patients (29 events) in the 
40-mg group compared with 29 of 100 patients (40 events) in the placebo group. Most

incidence between any of the three dose groups and the placebo group.
1.2.2 Phase IIIDouble -Blind Study  in Otherwise H ealthy  Patients 
(Study 1601T0831)
In this Phase III,double -blind study in otherwise healthy adults and adolescents 
12to64years of age with influenza, theefficacy and safety of baloxavir marboxil were
investigated. The dose studied was 40 mg for patients weighing 80 kg and 80 mg for 
patients weighing 80 kg.
Patients in the 20 to 64 years of age stratum received a single dose of 40 or 80 mg 
baloxavir marboxil (based on the patient’s body weight) , repeated dose of 75 mg 
oseltamivir twice daily (BID) for 5 days, or placebo.  In addition , patients in the 12 to 
19years of age stratum received a single dose of 40 mgor 80 mg baloxavir marboxil 
(based on the patient’s body weight) or placebo. A total of 1 ,432 patients received the 
study drug: 610 i n the baloxavir marboxil group, 309 in the placebo group, and 513 in 
the oseltamivir group.
The median time to alleviation of symptoms was 53.7 hours in the baloxavir marboxil 
group compared with 80.2 hours in the placebo group. The difference in the median 
time was 26.5 hours between the baloxavir marboxil group and the placebo group. 
Thebaloxavir marboxil group showed a significantly greater reduction in the time to 
alleviation of symptoms compared with the placebo group (two -sided p-value 0.000 1). 
In the adult stratum of patients, the median time to alleviation of symptoms was 
53.5 hours in the baloxavir marboxil group compared with 53.8 hours in the oseltamivir 
group ;no significant difference was found.
Of the secondary endpoints, significant decreases in both virus titer and the amount of 
virus RNA were found in the baloxavir marboxil group compared with the placebo group.  
The virus titer in the baloxavir marboxil group was reduced rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], and the mean virus 
titer on Day 2 was less than −3 log 10(50% tissue culture infectious dose [TCID 50/mL]) of 
that in the placebo group.  The mean change from baseline in the influenza virus titer 
was significantly greater in the baloxavir marboxil group than in the placebo group from 
Days 2 through 5.
The median time to cessation of viral shedding determined by [CONTACT_269520] 24 hours in 
the baloxavir marboxil group compared with 96 hours in the placebo group.  The 
difference in the time to cessation of virus shedding was 72 hours between the groups
(p0.0001 ).  A significant difference in the median time to cessation of viral shedding of 
48 hours (p 0.0001) was found also in comparison between the baloxavir marboxil 
(24hours) group and the oseltamivir group (72 hours) .  In addition, baloxavir marboxil 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_307147] 2 through 5 compared with that in the placebo group.  Also, when 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
17/Protocol CP40563 , Version 1compared withthe oseltamivir group, the proporti on of patients with positive influenza 
virus titer decreased significantly in the baloxavir marboxil group.
Beneficial effects of baloxavir marboxil on fever were also demonstrated. The proportion 
of patients who had fever was reduced more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_307148]. The median time to 
resolution of fever was shortened by 17.5 hours in the baloxavir marboxil group 
compared with the placebo group.
No deaths were reported in any groups. Two serious adverse events (viral meningitis 
and incarcerated inguinal hernia) were reported in 2 of 610 patients (0.3%) in the 
baloxavir marboxil group. The events resolved and were considered not related to study 
drug. Nine adverse events leading to withdrawal of study drug were reported: 3 events 
in 2 of 610 patients (0.3%) in the baloxavir marboxil group, 4 events in 1 of 309 patients 
(0.3%) in the placebo group, and 2 events in 2 of 513 patients (0.4%) in the oseltamivir 
group. 
All of the adverse event s leading to withdrawal of study drug in the baloxavir marboxil 
group were considered not related to the study drug. Adverse events were reported in 
126 of 610 patients (20.7%, 172 events) in the baloxavir marboxil group, 76 of 
309patients ( 24.6%, 118 events) in the placebo group, and 127 of 513 patients (24.8%, 
179events) in the oseltamivir group. No statistically significant difference was found in 
the incidence between the baloxavir marboxil group and the placebo group (the Fisher’s 
exact test, two -sided p-value 0.1781) or between the baloxavir marboxil group and the 
oseltamivir group ( p0.1146).
Except for bronchitis in the placebo group, there were no common adverse event s 
(incidence 5%) in any of the treatment groups. The relatively common adverse event s 
(incidence 2%) in any of the groups were bronchitis, sinusitis, diarrhea ,and nausea; 
however, each incidence of the adverse event in the baloxavir marboxil group was lower 
than or equal to that in the placebo group . In all three groups, the majority of the 
adverse event s was categorized as Grade 1 or 2 and resolved.
1.2.3 Phase III Open -Label Study in Otherw ise Healthy  Pediatric 
Patients (Study  1618T0822)
In this Phase III, open -label study in otherwise healthy pediatric patients, the efficacy of 
a single dose of baloxavir marboxil in patients aged 6 months to 12 years w as
investigated.   This study was conducted in Japan.  A total of 107 patients were enrolled :  
2, 31, 66, and 8 patients received a single 5 -, 10-, 20-, and 40 -mg dose of baloxavir 
marboxil, respectively. The doses administered in this study were 5, 10, 20 ,and 40 mg 
for patients who weighed 5to 10kg, 10 to 20 kg, 20 to 40 kg ,and  40 kg, 
respectively.
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
18/Protocol CP40563 , Version 1The median time to al leviation of influenza illness (time to alleviation of cough, nasal 
discharge/nasal congestion ,and fever) was 44.6 hours. Of the secondary endpoints, the 
median time to resolution of fever was 21.4 hours. In the virological endp oints, the mean 
change from baseline in the virus titer was 4.20 log 10(TCID50/mL)and the mean change 
from baseline in the amount of viral RNA was 1.75 log 10(virus particles/mL) on Day 2.
No deaths, serious adverse event s,ordiscontinuations due to adverse event s were 
reported in the study. Adverse event s were reported in 37 of 107 patients 
(34.6%, 49events). All adverse event s were classified as Grade [ADDRESS_375992] of the 
adverse event s resolved except for 3 adverse event s in 3 patients: 1 event each of 
dental caries, dry skin, and ligament sprain (these were judged by [CONTACT_307166] -up).
Adverse event soccurring at an incidence of at least 5% was vomiting in 8 patients 
(7.5%, 8events). All the cases of vomiting were classified as Grade 1, resolved, and 
considered not related to the study drug.
Baloxavir marboxil was considered generally safe when administered to pediatric 
patients with influenza at a single oral dose between 5mgand40 mg based on the 
patient’s body weight.
1.[ADDRESS_375993] riction of use are needed for the following reasons: 1) zanamivir 
is not licensed for treatment of influenza in very young children due to thedifficulty with 
inhalation in this group ( 5 or 7 years of age, depending on country) , 2) peramivir needs 
to be intravenously administered , and 3) oseltamivir requires BID dosing orally for [ADDRESS_375994] proven the efficacy and safety of 
baloxavir marboxil in the treatment of influenza vi rus infections for adult and adolescent
patients . Although limited clinical data is available in children ( one open -label Phase III

21/Protocol CP40563 , Version 13. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY
This isa multicenter, randomized, double- blind, active -controlled (i.e., oseltamivir) study 
to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of baloxavir marboxil compared 
with oseltamivir in pediatric patients 1 to 12 years of age with influenza -like symptoms .  
This study is designed to enroll approximately 120otherwise healthy ma le and female 
pediatric patients with influenza -likesymptoms presenting within 48 hours o f symptom 
onset .
Patients will be recruited in parallel to the following two cohorts:
5 to 12 years of age (minimum 40 patients)
1 to 5 years of age (minimum 20 patients)
Baloxavir marboxil will be given as a single -dose, based on body weight at screening.  
The approved dose for oseltamivir in pediatric patients 1 to 12 years of age is BID for 
5days, based on body weight (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) .  Either drug ,along with the 
corresponding placebo of its comparator in this trial, will be started at the time of 
randomization.
Patients will be screened and randomized on Day 1 and assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil based on body weight (2mg/kg for 
patients weighing 20 kg or 40 mg for patients weighing 20 kg)or oseltamivir (dose 
based on body weight ) for 5 days . Re-screening of patients who fail to meet the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will not be permitted for the same illness epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] , as the 
time from symptom onset to treatment window is limited to 48 hours.
The study consists of two per iods:  a 5-daytreatment period (mandatory visits on Days 1, 
2, and 4) and a 24-day safety follow -up peri od(mandatory visits on Days 6, 10, and 29).  
Therefore, the total study duration for each patient will be 29 days.
During the 5 -day treatment period , each patient randomized to baloxavir marboxil will 
receive the oseltamivir matching placebo BID for 5 days ,and those patients randomized 
to oseltamivir will receive one dose of baloxavir marboxil matching placebo on Day 1.
The following assessments will be conducted at clinic visits:  physical examination, vital 
signs, adverse events, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], clinical laboratory tests, and nasal/throat 
swabs.  Please see Appendix 1for details concerning the timing of these assessments.  
In addition, pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be collected at the time point s indicated in 
Appendix 2.
Throughout the treatment and safety follow -up periods, the parent s/caregiver swill 
maintain a patient diaryfor each patient in order to record body temperature s(tympanic 
assessment) , influenza symptoms ,and acetaminophen use.  Temperatures will be 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F.Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd

BID(morning and evening) onDays 4 to 9; and once daily onDays10 to 15.  Influenza 
symptoms will be recorded BID(morning and evening) onDays1 to 9 and once daily on 
Days 10 to 15.

Note:  The baloxavir marboxil dose will be based on the body  weight of the child ( 2mg/kgfor 
patients weighing 20kg or 40 mg for patients weighing 20 kg).  Oseltamivir will be 
administered per the Tamiflu®local prescribing information (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
This study will be conducted at sites inthe [LOCATION_002] and globally . 
To facilitate early and close monitoring of safety parameters over time, an Internal 
Monitoring Committee (IMC) will review aggregate safety data on an ongoing basis as 
defined in the IMC charter .  If there is any concern noted in the safety parameters, the 
Sponsor may suspend or discontinue a treatment arm or the entire study, as 
appropriate.
A schedule of activities is provided in Appendix 1.

23/Protocol CP40563 , Version 13.[ADDRESS_375997] been demonstrated in previous studies using baloxavir 
marboxil 10-mg and 20-mgtablets .
In this study, baloxavir marboxil will be administered as granules for suspension. 
Bioequivalence of the suspension and the 20-mg tablet (which was tested in clinical 
studies) was confirmed in a previous study .  
Proposed pediatric doses in this study were determined according to the modeling and
simulation of S -033447 pharmacokinetics in a pediatric population. Population PK 
analys is had been performed in pediatric population s by [CONTACT_307167] s inJapan (1618T0822) to develop a 
population PK model for pediatrics.
Simulation of Caucasian pediatric drug exposure was performed for 1,000 patients 
(26,000 patients in total) for every [ADDRESS_375998] to their ability to match adult 
drug exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentra tiontime curve (AUC), 
maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax), plasma concentration 24 hours after dosing ( C24;
acceptable time window:  20 to 28 hours) ,and 72 hours after dosing (C 72).  The o ptimal 
dose and body weight cutoff for flat dosing were based on a comparison of the simulated 
drug exposures with those obtained in the Phase IIIstudy (1601T0831) for patients 
receiving 40 mg baloxavir marboxil (body weight 80 kg) and patients receiving 80 mg 
baloxavir marboxil (body weight 80 kg), those obtained in the pediatric Phase IIIstudy 
(1618T0822) ,and those obtained in the Phase Ithorough corrected QT interval (QTc)
study (1527T0816) for patients receiving 80 mg baloxavir marboxil. Simulations showed 
that optimal exposure matching to adults in terms of both total (AUC) and sustained (C 72) 
drug exposure was achieved with 2 mg/kg in children weighing less than 20 kg and flat
dosing of 40 mg in children weighing 20 kg.
In this study, baloxavir marboxil will be administered based to the body weight recor ded 
at screening (i.e., 2mg/kg for patients weighing 20 kg or 40 mg for patients weighing 
20 kg)to obtain similar exposure of S -033447 to that resulting from the administration 
of 40mg or 80 mgbaloxavir marboxil (based on body weight) toadults in Phase IIIand 
Japanese pediatric Phase IIIstudies.   For information on the formulation and handling of 
baloxavir marboxil, see the pharmacy manual.

approximate 2:[ADDRESS_376002] or proper interpretation of this study.  
Laboratories responsible for performing study drug PK assays will be unblinded to 
patients 'treatment assignments to identify appropriate samp les to be analyzed.  PK 
samples from patients assigned to the comparator arm will not be analyzed for study 
drug PK concentration except by [CONTACT_32236] (e.g., to evaluat e a possible error in dosing).
4.2.2 Unblinding Methods
If unblinding is necessary for a medical emergency (e.g., in the case of a serious 
adverse event for which patient management might be affected by [CONTACT_123514]), the investigator will be able to break the treatment code by 
[CONTACT_123517].  The investigator is not require d to contact [CONTACT_307170] g the treatment code; however, the treatment code should not be broken 
except in emergency situations.
If the investigator wishes to know the identity of the study drug for any reason other than 
a medical em ergency , he or she should contact [CONTACT_66324].  The 
investigator should document and provide an explanation for any non-emergency 
unblinding.   The investigator will be able to break the treatment code by [CONTACT_307171].
As per health authority reporting requirements, the Sponsor 's Drug Safety representative
will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions 
(see Section 5.7) that are considered by [CONTACT_123518].  The patient may continue to receive treatment, and the investigator , patient, 
and Sponsor personnel, with the exception of the Drug Safety repres entative and 
personnel who must have access to patient treatment assignments to fulfill their roles 
(as defined above), will remain blinded to treatment assignment.

4.5.6 Patient -Reported Outcomes
TheCanadian Acute Respir atory Illness and Flu Scale (CARI FS)will be used to 
document the treatment benefit ofbaloxavir marboxil.
CARIFS is a reliable parental questionnaire and is composed of 18 questions, each with 
a 4-point Likert response. The questionnaire covers three domains :symptoms 
(e.g., cough) ,function (e.g., play), and parental impact (e.g., clinginess).  The CARIFS is 
calculated as the sum of the items and measures duration of illness.   Data handling 
conventions will be defined and described in the statistical analysis plan.
The questionnaire will be completed in its entirety by [CONTACT_307176] (see Appendix 1).To ensure instrument validity and that 
data standards meet health authority requirements, the questionnaire will be 
administered before the parent/caregiver or patient receives any information on disease 
status, prior to the performance of nonpatient -reported outcome ( PRO )assessments, 
and prior to the administration of study treatment, unless otherwise specified.
Parent/ caregiver swilluse an electronic device to capture PRO data.  The electronic 
device and/or instructions for completing the q uestionnaires electronically will be

34/Protocol CP40563 , Version 15. ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY
5.1 SAFETY PLA N
The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with baloxavir 
marboxil in completed and ongoing studies.  There are no anticipated important safety 
risks forbaloxavir marboxil .  Please refer to the Baloxavir Marboxil Investigator's 
Brochure for a complete summa ry of safety information.
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study.  
Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients potentially at higher risk for 
serious influenza and toxicities.  Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the study, 
including assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events.  
Inaddition, guidelines for managing adverse events, including criteria for dosage 
modification and treatment interruption or di scontinuation, are provided below .
5.1.1 Internal Monitoring Committee
An IMC will review the clinical study data at regular intervals as defined in the IMC 
charter .  Should a safety concern be identified, a treatment arm or the entire study may 
be suspended or discontinued, as appropriate.
5.1.2 Management of Patient sWho Experience Adverse Events
Baloxavir marboxil is administered as a single -dose treatment ,so no dose modification
or treatment discontinuation is possible. However, the study medication can still be 
suspended or the patients can be discontinued if adverse events are considered to be 
related to the study medication ( baloxavir marboxil or oseltamivir )in patients who 
experience toxicity considered to be related to oseltamivir .  
5.[ADDRESS_376010] ,performing 
protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments ,measuring protocol -specified vital 
signs,and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety 
evaluation of the study.
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4.
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
35/Protocol CP40563 , Version 15.2.[ADDRESS_376011], regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal prod uct, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for more information)
Recurrence of an intermittent medical con dition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from stud y drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)
This does not include any adverse event that ,had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death.
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal lif e 
functions)
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug
Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes 
listed above)
The terms "severe "and "serious "are notsynonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event ( e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Crite ria for Adverse Events [ NCI CTCAE ]; see 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
36/Protocol CP40563 , Version 1Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as 
severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).
5.2.[ADDRESS_376012] (Immediately  Reportable to 
the Sponsor)
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_33473] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 , for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of specia l interest for this study 
are as follows :
Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s 
law(see Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257] , as defined as 
follows:
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., p rion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected.
5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4, Section 5.5, and 
Section 5.6.
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).  
5.3.[ADDRESS_376013].  All 
adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_7071]/caregiver or patient or noted by [CONTACT_25617], will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
37/Protocol CP40563 , Version 1After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedur es such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported 
(see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).
After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported until 28days after the 
last dose of study drug.
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting 
period are provided in Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following:
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit? "
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here? "
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of A dverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v 5.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 2 will be used for assessing seve rity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE .

adverse event in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_376014] be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes"or"no"
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also 
Table 3 ):
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug ( asapplicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications kno wn to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
39/Protocol CP40563 , Version 1Table 3Causal A ttribution Guidance
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused b y the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]'s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
orconcomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
firstdose of study drug).
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.
5.3.[ADDRESS_376015] medical terminology/concepts when recording a dverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
Adiagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse ev ents 
based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
40/Protocol CP40563 , Version [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events That A reSecondary  to Other Events
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically signific ant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eC RF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
All adverse events should be record ed separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.   Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme sev erity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
by[CONTACT_25748] "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event 
became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
41/Protocol CP40563 , Version 1Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically s ignificant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an ad verse event.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., ALP and bilirubin 5 upper limit of normal [ ULN]associated with chole stasis ), only 
the diagnosis (i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range 
(e.g., "elevated potassium, "as opposed to "abnormal potassium ").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia. "
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage mo dification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital si gn findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).

42/Protocol CP40563 , Version [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as 
defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s l aw).  Therefore, i nvestigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
2ULN
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice
Themost appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or a nadverse event of special interest (see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  This 
includes death attributed to progression of influenza .
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single m edical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death "should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death "should 
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].   The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
If the death is attributed to progression of influenza , “influenza progression "should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section 5.6.
The IMC will monitor the frequency of deaths from all causes.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
43/Protocol CP40563 , Version 1A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g.,"more frequent headaches ").
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of Influenza
Medical occurrences or symptoms of deterioration that are anticipated as part of 
influenza, such as fluctuation in symptoms, should only be recorded as an adverse event 
if judged by [CONTACT_307181].  W hen recording an unanticipated 
worsening of influenza on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., "accelerated 
worsening of influenza ").

5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Cases of Overdose, Medication 
Error, Drug A buse, or Drug Misuse
Overdose (accidental or intentional), medication error, drug abuse, and drug misuse 
(hereafter collectively referred to as "special situations") are defined as follows:
Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose
Intentional overdose:  intentional administration of a drug i n a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose}
Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug 
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of 
the drug.
Drug abuse:  intentional excessive use of a drug that may lead to addiction or 
dependence, physical harm, and/or psychological harm
Drug misuse:  intentional deviation in the administration of a drug that does not 
qualify as drug abuse
In cases where drug is to be self administered by [CONTACT_102] , drug misuse could 
involve the drug being administered to someone other than the patient.

6.1 ANAL YSIS POPU LATIONS
The main analysis populations are defined below.
6.1.1 Randomized Population
Not applicable .
6.1.2 Per Protocol Population
Not applicable .
6.1.3 Intent -to-Treat Patient Population
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population comprises all patients who received at least one dose 
of treatment regardless of whether they have any follow -up assessments. Patients will 
be grouped on the basis of randomized treatment. If there is any doubt whether a 
patient was treated, that patient will be assumed to have been treated for the pur pose of 
analysis.
6.1.4 Intent -to-Treat Influenza -Infected Patient Population
The intent -to-treat influenza -infected (ITTi) population is a subset of ITT patients who 
have had a laboratory confirmation of influenza infection ( polymerase chain reaction 
[PCR] result) from any swab sample collected at baseline or during the study. The ITTi 
population is the primary efficacy population, unless specified otherwise. Patients will be 
grouped based on randomized treatment.
Decisions on patient exclusion from the ITTi p opulation will be made prior to database 
closure. Excluded patients will be documented, together with the reason for exclusion.
6.1.5 Pharmacokinetic Evaluable Population
The pharmacokinetic -evaluable patient (PKEP) population comprises all patients in the 
ITT population who have at least one post -dose drug concentration measur ement at a 
scheduled visit timepoint. Patients may be excluded from the PKEP population if they 
significantly violate the inclusion or exclusion criteria or deviate significantly from the
protocol, or if data are unavailable or incomplete (which may influence the PK analysis).
Decisions on patient exclusion from the PKEP population will be made prior to database 
closure by [CONTACT_307183]. Excluded patients will be documented, together 
with the reason for exclusion.
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd

All verbatim adverse event terms will be mapped to MedDRA thesaurus terms, and 
adverse event severity will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v 5.0.
The safety of baloxavir marboxil will be evaluated from adverse event s, vital sign 
measurements ,and clinical laboratory tests.   Safety parameters will be summarized or 
listed for the safety population.
6.6 PHA RMA COKINETIC A NALYSES
The PK EPpopulation (see Section 6.1.5 ) will be used for all analyses. 
For patients with blood samples collected, individu al plasma baloxavir marboxil and 
S-033447 concentrations will be tabulated by [CONTACT_307185] . Individual and 
mean (if appropriate) plasma baloxavir marboxil and S -033447 concentration sversus 
time data will be plotted by [CONTACT_307186] -weight group s (e.g., 510 kg, 10 15 kg, etc.) .
For patient s undergoing intensive PK assessments (Appendix 2), individual PK
parameter s of baloxavir marboxil and S -033447 (AUC, Cmax, time to maximum plasma 
concentration, and terminal half -life)may be calculated using model -independent 
methods, as applicable .Parameters will be listed and summarized (mean, standard 
deviation, coefficient of variation, median, minimum, and maximum )by [CONTACT_307187] -weight group . TheC24and C 72of S-033447 will be listed and summarized (mean, 
standard deviation, coe fficient of variation, median, minimum, and maximum) by [CONTACT_307187] -weight group.
In addition, n on-linear mixed -effects model (NONMEM, Version 7.3 or higher) will be 
used to analyze the PK data. The population typi[INVESTIGATOR_307154] (e.g., apparent 
clearance, apparent volume of distribution for the central compartment ) and their 
covariates will be estimated.  Individual PK metrics ,such as area under the 
concentration– time curve from Time 0 to infinity ( AUC inf), C24, C72,and C max, will be also 
calculated using post hoc Bayesian estimation for each patient , and plotted against 
significant covariates identified (e.g., body weight , age ).  The derived individual values 
will be plotted against body weight and age . PK parameters will be tabulated and 
summ arized (i.e., by [CONTACT_8477], standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, and 
minimum and maximum) by [CONTACT_551] . PK exposure and response (e.g., virus titers) 
relationships will be explored. Population PK results may be reported in a dedicated 
modelling and simulation report.
Additional PK analyses will be conducted as appropriate.
Pediatric exposure matching to adults will use C 24(observed, as well as Bayesian 
post hoc) as a primary PK parameter.  K ey secondary PK metrics ,such as C 72and 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
52/Protocol CP40563 , Version 1AUC inf (derived as Bayesian post hoc) ,will assess whether exposure is sustained 
similarly as in adults, and to explore whether or not viral rebound , if any, may be 
associated with lower C 72values .  For completeness, C maxwill be calculated as 
secondary PK pa rameter. 
6.[ADDRESS_376027] deviations, medians, and ranges for 
continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables, as appropriate.  
Time -to-event endpoints and duration endpoints will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier 
plots and summaries of the median survival time.  Summaries will be presented by

Full details of all planned tables, listings, graphs, and descriptive analyses will be 
provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan, which will be finalized prior to u nblinding .
6.8 INTERIM ANAL YSES
An interim PK analysis is planned in this study. PK samples ,up to and including those 
collected at Visit 4/[ADDRESS_376028] 12 patients dosed ,will b e batched for an early shipment .  
This will enable a timely r eview of the systemic plasma concentrations, in particular the 
concentration at 24 hours and 72 hours after dosing (C24and C 72, respectively ) 
(Appendix 1andAppendix 2).  This is in order to verify ,in a timely manner ,that 
exposures at the proposed doses are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding 
values seen in adult s. The estimated turnaround time between last sample collected 
and data review is estimated to be approximately 2 to 3 weeks , and recruitment will 
continue during this time . Data review of blinded PK samples (dummy I D) will be 
performed by [CONTACT_307161] .
Noother interim analyses are planned in this study. However, given there is no formal 
statistical hypothesis testing in this study, the Sponsor may choose to conduct up to two 
interim analyses.  The decision to conduct an optional interim analysis and the timing of 
the analysis will be documented in the Sponsor’s trial master file prior to the co nduct of 
the interim analysis.  The interim analysis willbe performed and interpreted by [CONTACT_307188] .  Access to 
treatment assignment information w ould follow the Sponsor’s standard procedures.
7. DATA COLLECTION A ND M ANAG EMENT
7.1 DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE
The Sponsor will be responsible for data man agement of this study, including quality 
checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of

Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
54/Protocol CP40563 , Version 1Once the study is complete, the data, audit trail, and trial and system documentation will 
be archived.  The investigator will receive patient data for the site in both human -and 
machine- readable formats on an archival -quality compact disc that must be kept with the 
study records as source data.  Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is 
required.  In addition, the Sponsor will receive all data in a machine -readable f ormat on a 
compact disc.
7.4 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to confirm that 
critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_77038], complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorde d 
and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PROs, evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copie sof 
transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, 
microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, 
and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical departments
involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retenti on of records described in Section 7.6.
To facilitate source data verification and review , the investigators and institutions must 
provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for 
trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also 
allow inspection by [CONTACT_25756].
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An 
acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry 
of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail 
that sho ws the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_33508], and date of the change.

Clinical Protocol ET743 -OVC -3006 – Amendment [ADDRESS_412745] recent amendment.
Amendment 6 (9January 2018 )
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 
2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union .
The overall reason for the amendment: The sponsor’s decision to amend the study protocol was based on the 
Independent Data M onitoring Committee (IDMC ) recommendation to discontinue the study based on the results of 
a futility analysis of overall survival (OS), in which the prespecified futility threshold w as crossed .In addition, the 
amendment will allow study subjects deriving clinical benefit to continue on single -agentDOXIL®per local 
standard of care.
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: Study conduct was changed due to the IDMC recommendation to discontinue the study.

Information; Section 
16.1, Study -Specific 
Design 
Considerations; 
Attachment 7Text w as added in full or in part to reflect the following: On 26 June 2017, the IDMC 
requested a futility analysis of OS to be performed at the time of the next meeting 
6months later. Following the review of the study data by [CONTACT_334305] 15 December 
2017, the HR for OS was 0.962, crossing the previously agreed upon thresho ld for futility 
of 0.93. In view  of this result and the observed and expected higher toxicity in Arm A as 
compared with Arm B, the IDMC recommended discontinuing the study. Therefore, as of 
Amendment 6, no new subjects will be randomized to study treatment , and treatment with 
trabectedin should be immediately discontinued for subjects assigned to Arm A 
(trabectedin+DOXIL). All study subjects (Arm A or Arm B) currently on study who, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], are deriving clinical benefit may contin ue treatment with 
single -agent DOXIL as per the local standard of care. Treatment for these subjects may 
continue as long as the subjects comply with protocol -specified prohibitions and 
restrictions for treatment and as long as they experience clinical ben efit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046]. DOXIL will be provided by [CONTACT_37738]&D as needed until post -trial access to 
DOXIL is available or until disease progres sion, whichever occurs first.
Accordingly, the end of study data collection is defined as when all subje cts on study 
treatment have completed treatment termination visit assessments as specified in the Time 
and Events Schedule for Amendment [ADDRESS_412746] of care, 
only serious adverse events should be reported to JR&D .
All subjects still on study treatment should be informed of the reasons for the 
discontinuation of the study, and the potential risks and benefits of continued treatment 
with s ingle -agent DOXIL should be discussed.

Attachment 7Text w as added to indicate that: Follow ing Ame ndment 6, in those instances where the 
investigator confirms that single -agent treatment with DOXIL would be a clinically 
appropriate therapeutic option for subjects currently in screening, those subjects in 
screening would need to meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria as specified in 
Sections 4.1and 4.2.
In addition, inclusion criteria #7 and #9 and exclusion criteria #3 and #5 no longer apply 
for these subjects per Ame ndment 6 for the following reasons: efficacy will not be 
monitored for subjects receiving single -agent DOXIL after Amendment 6, IV 
administration of dexamethasone is only applicable for subjects receiving trabectedin and 
trabectedin treatment ends with Amendment 6, central venous catheter access is only 
needed for trabectedin administration (no longer applicable), hypersensitivity to 
trabectedin and it’s excipi[INVESTIGATOR_334277]. .

cumulative dose of planned anthracycline t reatment with DOXIL (ie, after C ycle 3 for 
treatment Arm A and after C ycle 2 for treatment Arm B) and as part of end -of-treatment 
assessments (ie, end -of-treatment termination visit). In addition, those subjects who 
receive a total cumulative dose of anthracycline exceeding 300 mg/m2(including previous 
and on -study treatments) or have a clinically significant history of cardiomyopathy should 
have follow -up LVEF assessments after every 2 cycles of therapy, or as clinically 
warranted. The same methodology (MUGA scans or 2D- ECHOs) should be used to assess
scheduled LVEF assessments throughout the study. Additional LVEF assessments 
performed during the study should be reported as unscheduled LVEF assessments.

Approved, 9 January 2018Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: To add the LVEF assessment to the list of criteria to be met for continuation of treatment (as noted in 
Table 1) and to update the corresponding text regarding this criterion.
Section 6.1, Criteria 
for Continuation of 
TreatmentTable [ADDRESS_412751] be ≥ the low er 
limit of normal [LLN] for treatment to continue. In addition ,the following corresponding 
text regarding continuation of treatment based on the LVEF assessment was updated: 
Subjects m ust discontinue DOXIL for clinical evidence of cardiac toxicity or if the LVEF 
is compromised (ie, any absolute decrease in LVEF ≥10% and an LVEF value below the 
institutional lower limit of normal [LLN]). How ever, dosing with trabectedin should 
continue i f the criteria for continuation of treatment are met ( Table 1 ) at the same dose. For 
those subjects on treatment Arm A who continue with trabectedin as a monotherapy after a 
cumulative anthracycline dose of 300 mg/m2has been exceeded or due to cardiotoxicity , 
regular monitoring of LVEF every 2 cycles of treatment should continue, regardless of the 
cumulative dose of anthracycline. All subjects in Arm A should undergo LVEF 
assessments after Cycle 3 of study treatment, even if DOXIL has been discontinued.
Rationale: To add parameters for dose reductions in cases of LVEF decline or cardiomyopathy .
Section 6.2.2, Dose 
Reductions Due to 
Nonhematologic 
ToxicityTable [ADDRESS_412752] and subsequent occurrences of 
LVEF decline ≥10% and <LLN or clinical evidence of cardiomyopathy .
Rationale: To add text indicating the follow -up procedures to potential cases of cardiac toxicity and the 
documentation required.
Section 9.5, Safety 
EvaluationsThe follow ing text was added:
In selected cases of cardiac adverse events, investigators may be asked to complete a 
supplemental CRF section in order to provide more detailed information relating to the 
event. Any additional LVEF assessments should be reported as unscheduled assessments.
Rationale: Text added for clarification regarding local requirements.

A Randomized, Open -Label Study Comparing the Combination of YONDELISand

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_59124], Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_334284]: 2012 -004808-34
Trabectedin (YONDELIS)is a tris, tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid initially isolated from the marine 
ascidian ecteinascidin turbinate. It has a unique mechanism of action that involves the transcription-
dependent nucleotide excision repair system and is currently under developm ent as an antineoplastic 
agent. Trabectedin has been approved in the European Union and other countries outside the United 
States of America ([LOCATION_003]) for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and ovarian cancer , and it has 
been approved in the [LOCATION_003] for th e treatment of unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma 
in patients who received a prior anthracycline -containing regimen .
Trabectedin and DOXIL (as per protocol, DOXIL refers to DOXIL/doxorubicin hydrochloride [HCl] 
liposome injection [[LOCATION_003] only] and CAELYX/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [PLD ] [non- [LOCATION_003]]) , 
[ADDRESS_412773] shown efficacy in treating women with advanced 
ovarian cancer. The combination of trabectedin and DOXIL has previously been demonstrate d to improve 
progression- free survival (PFS), as compared with DOXIL monotherapy, in the second -line treatment of 
refractory ovarian cancer. Median overall survival (OS) was also increased by 3.3months in the 
combined trabectedin+DOXIL treatment arm, but this result did not reach statistical significance 
(p=0.08 35). Retrospective analysis suggested that the efficacy of the trabectedin+DOXIL combination 
was greatest insubjects with platinum -sensitive disease (subjects with a platinum -free interval 
6months) , and that the lack of statistical significance for OSmay have resulted from an imbalance in 
prognostic factors. Thus, limiting treatment to patients with platinum -sensitive disease is expected to 
result in improved demonstrated efficacy, as well a s an improved risk -benefit ratio.
Currently, there are fewprospective studies that have examined the third -line treatment of patients with 
refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296]. Study ET743 -OVC -3006 is designed to investigate the activity of

 To conduct pharmacogenomic evaluations of OS, PFS and other endpoints in subjects with and 
without mutation s in BRCA1 orBRCA2.
 To evaluate patient -reported outcomes (PROs).
Hypothesis
Trabectedin in combination with DOXIL will improve OS compared with DOXIL monotherapy in the 
treatment of subjects with platinum -sensitive advanced -relapsed epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], primary peritone al, or 
fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_334286] 2 previous lines of platinum -based chemotherapy.
OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN
This is a randomized, open -label, active -controlled, multicenter study designed to assess the efficacy and 
safety of trabecte din+DOXIL as a third -line chemotherapy in subjects with platinum -sensitive 
advanced -relapsed epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], primary peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_334286] 
2previous lines of platinum -based chemotherapy. Approximately [ADDRESS_412774] be 
performed within 30 days before randomization. 
Atrandomi zation, subjects will be stratified by 4 criteria: 1) the time from the last dose of first-line 
platinum therapy to disease progression (6months to 12 months vs>12 months to 24 months vs 
>24months), 2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performa nce status grade (0 vs 1), 
3)BRCA 1/2 status (mutation vs no mutation), and 4) prior DOXIL therapy (no vs yes). Subjects will 
then be randomly assigned in a 1:1ratio to the trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy group (Arm A) 
or to the DOXIL monotherapy gr oup (Arm B) .
During the Treatment Phase, subjects will receive study drug by [CONTACT_95077] 1 of a 21-day cycle 
in Arm A and on Day 1 of a 28-day cycle in Arm B. Treatment will continue until the occurrence of 
disease progression or unacceptable treatm ent toxicity , or until 2 cycles after assessment of a complete 
response (CR) . Subjects assigned to the trabectedin+DOXIL group (Arm A) will be pretrea ted with 
20mg of IV dexamethasone (or an equivalent IV corticosteroid) approximately 30minutes prior to 
initiation of infusion of DOXIL IV, on Day 1 of each treatment cycle . Treatment efficacy endpoints will 
be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST , Version 1.1). Scheduled 
assessments of disease status will be performed within 30days before randomization, every 8 weeks 
(5days) after randomization for the first 4 assessments, and then every 12weeks (5days) thereafter. 
Disease assessments , including assessments for subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than 
disease progression, willbe performed until disease progression is radiographically confirmed ,the start of 
subsequent anticancer therapy, withdrawal of subject consent, or the clinical cutoff date. For subjects
discontinuing study treatment , documentation of all subsequent anticancer therapy, survival status, and 
safety evaluations as outlined in the Time and Events Schedule will be required . Survival status follow-up 
should be done at least every [ADDRESS_412775] results and the incidence and severity of adverse events. Left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) assessments (either multigated acquisition [MUGA] scans or 2-dimensional 
echocard iograms [2D-ECHO ]) and electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be used to monitor cardiac function.
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will assess safety and efficacy data. Safety data 
will be reviewed approximately every 6 months . An interim analysis of OS will be performed after

Clinical Protocol ET743 -OVC -3006 – Amendment [ADDRESS_412776] and offer advice as needed. 
On 26 June 2017 , the IDM C requested a futility analysis of OSto be performed at the time of the next 
meeting 6 months later. Following thereview of the study data by [CONTACT_334305] 15 December 2017, the 
HR for OS was 0.962, crossing the previously agreed upon threshold for futility of 0.93. In view of this 
result and the observed and expected higher toxicity in Arm A as compared with Arm B, the IDMC 
recommended discontinuing the study .Therefore, as of Amendment 6,no new subjects will be 
randomized to study treatment, and treatment with trabectedin should be immediately discontinued for 
subjects assigned to Arm A (trabectedin+DOXIL) . All study subjects (Arm A orArm B) currently on 
study who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], are deriving clinical benefit may continue treatment with 
single -agent DOXIL as per the local stand ard of care. Treatment forthese subjects may continue as long 
as the subjects compl y with protocol -specified prohibitions and restrictions for treatment andas long as 
they experience clinical benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] . DOXIL will be provided by [CONTACT_37738]&D as 
needed until post -trial access to DOXIL is available or until disease progression, whichever occurs first.
Accordingly, the end of study data collection is defined as when all subjects on study treatment have 
completed treatment termination visit assessments as specified in the Time and Events Schedule for 
Amendment [ADDRESS_412777] of care, only serious adverse event s should be reported to 
JR&D.
SUBJECT POPULATION
Eligible women must fulfill all study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will beat least [ADDRESS_412778] :
 ECOG performance sta tus Grade 0 or 1.
 First-line treatment with a platinum -based regimen ,and no evidence of disease progression for 
6months after the last dose .
 Second- line treatment with a platinum -based regimen, with progression of disease after attaining a 
CR or partial response ( PR). Complete response or PR could have been determined by [CONTACT_334313]-125 levels . 
 Progression of disease based on imaging after the second -line platinum -based regimen .
 Subjects treated with a DOXIL -containing regimen as a second -line therapy are eligible if 
subsequent disease progression occurs [ADDRESS_412779] dose .
 No more than 2 prior lines of systemic therapy.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Study treatment occurs on Day 1 (+2 days) of each 21-day cycle for subjects assigned toTreatment 
Arm A and on Day 1 (+2 days) of each 28 -day cycle for subjects assigned to Treatment Arm B.
 Treatment Arm A: DOXIL 30 mg/m2administered as an IV infusion over approximately 
90minutes (per package insert) followed by [CONTACT_334310] 1.1 mg/m2administered as an IV infusion
over approximately 3h, via central venous access, every [ADDRESS_412780] infusion, DOXIL may be administered as a 60-to 90-minute infusion in subsequent cycles. All 
subjects assigned to Treatment Arm A will be premedicated with 20 mg dexamethasone, 
administered IV approximately 30 minutes before the start of the DOXIL infusion, to reduce the

Approved, 9 January 2018incidence of transaminase elevation related to trabectedin. If dexamethasone is not available, an 
equivalent IV dose of another corticosteroid may be substituted.
 Treatment Arm B:DOXIL, 50 mg/m2administered as an IV infusion over approximately 
90minutes (per package insert) every 4weeks. If no infusion- related reaction is observed with 
DOXIL after the first infusion, DOXIL may be administered as a 60-to 90-minute infusion in 
subsequent cycles.
Investigators will review physical findings , adverse events, and the results of clinical laboratory tests 
before each dose of study drug and, if required, delay administration or reduce the dose according to the 
protocol- defined guidelines .
EFFICACY EVALUATIONS/ENDPOINTS
Efficacy will be assessed by a determination of OS, PFS, and ORR. Measurable disease and the response 
criteria based on measurable disease used in this protocol are defined in the RECIST (Version 1.1)
guidelines. Radiological disease assessments (thoraco -abdominal and pelvic computed tomography [CT]
scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] measurements and evaluation of extent of disease) will be 
performed within 30days before randomization , every 8 weeks (±5 days) after randomization for the first 
4 asses sments, and then every 12weeks (±5days) thereafter. Disease assessments, including assessments 
for subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression, will be performed until 
disease progression is radiographically confirmed , the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, withdrawal 
of subject consent, or the clinical cutoff date.
Assessments must be done consistently in both treatment arms to ensure an unbiased assessment of tumor 
response and progression. The CA-[ADDRESS_412781] consent, or the clinical cutoff date. CA-125 evaluations should coincide (5 days) with the 
scheduled tumor assessments. Survival follow -up will continue for all enrolled subjects until at least 
514deaths are observed or until the clinical cutoff date .
As of Amendment 6, follow -up data will no longer be collected.
PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS
Sparse samples for measurement of trabectedin concentrations in plasma will becollected from at least 
40subjects administered trabectedin+ DOXIL. 
PHARMACOGENOMIC EVALUATIONS
BRCA 1/2mutation data will be collected at screening. If BRCA 1/2 mutation status has not been 
determined, a blood sample (10 mL) will be collected for BRCA 1/2analysis. In addition, an optional
pharmacogenomic blood sample (4mL) will be collected from consenting subjects to allow for 
pharma cogenomic research (where local regulations permit) .
SAFETY EVALUATIONS
The incidence and severity of adverse events will be assessed for all subjects who receive study drug. 
Clinical laboratory test results will be evaluated before dosing (ie, within 2 days prior to dosing) on Day 1 
of each cycle. Blood samples will also be collected for clinical laboratory testing on +/-2 days on Days 8
and15 (Treatment Arm A)or Days 8, 15, and 22 (Treatment Arm B) of each cycle and at the end of 
treatment. Electrocardiograms and LVEF assessments (either MUGA scans or 2D-ECHO) will be 
performed for all subjects at screening (baseline), after Cycle 3 for treatment Arm A and after Cycle 2 for 
treatment Arm B, and as part of end-of-treatment assessments. In addition, those subjects who receive a

or have a clinically significant history of cardiomyopathy should have follow -up LVEF assessments after 
every 2 cycles of therapy, or as clinically warranted .
Following the IDMC recommendation to stop the study (clinical cutoff date of 18 January 2018), only 
serious adverse events for subjects continuing to receive single -agent DOXIL should be reported to 
JR&D.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample Size Justification
It is assumed that failure will follow an expo nential distribution with a constant hazard rate. Assuming a 
median OS of 16months for the active control group (DOXIL monotherapy), a planned sample size of 
approximately 670 subjects will provide 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR)of 0.78 (16month s vs
20.5 months) at a 2-tailed significance level of 0.05 and anenrollment duration of approximately 
52months (13subjects/month enrollment) over a total study duration of [ADDRESS_412782] 
limit method and un-stratified Cox proportional hazards model will be used to estimate the time-to-event 
variables and to obtain the HR and their 95% confidence intervals. The un-stratified log-rank test will be 
used as the primary analysis for treatment comparison. The response rate variables will be evaluated using 
the Chi-square statistic (un-stratified). Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint using the stratified
log-rank test will also be performed. Subgroup analyses will be carried out to assess if the treatment effect 
is consistent across clinically relevant subgroups .

Approved, 9 January [ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTION
Trabectedin (YONDELIS) is a tris tetrahy droisoquinoline alkaloid originally  isolated from the 
marine ascidian ecteinascidin turbinate , Ecteinascidia turbinata . It exerts its action by  [CONTACT_334316] N2 position of guanine in the minor groove of deox yribonucleic acid (DNA ), unlike other 
DNA- binding agents that bind to the major groove. This bends the DNA towards the major 
groove, a propert y unique to this class of DNA -binding agents , thereby  [CONTACT_334317].12In contrast to other DNA- binding cytotoxic agents, which are either equally  or 
more effective in cells containing defects of the transcription- coupled nucleotide excision repair 
(NER) pathway , trabectedin is more effective in cells with an intact NER pathway .6,[ADDRESS_412805] on tumor -associated macrophages and 
histioc ytes.1,5,7
Trabectedin is approved in the European Union (EU) and in other countries outside the United 
States of America ([LOCATION_003]) for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (STS,) and relapsed platinum -
sensitive ovarian cancer . The requirement for platinum- sensitivity  for the indication of ovarian 
cancer varies by [CONTACT_1606]. In the [LOCATION_003], trabectedin is approved for the treatment of unresectable 
or metastatic liposa rcoma or leiomy osarcoma in patients who received a prior anthracy cline -
containing regimen.
DOXIL/CAELYXis doxorubicin hy drochloride (HCl) encapsulated in STEALTHliposomes 
for IV administration. Doxorubicin belongs to the anthracy cline class and has a broad spectrum 
of antineoplastic activity . DOXIL(also known as doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) is 
approved by [CONTACT_6581] (US FDA )and CAELYX(also 
known as pegy lated liposomal doxorubicin [PLD]) is approved by [CONTACT_334318]  (EMA) and other countries for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Generic doxorubicin HCl
liposome injection was recentl y approved by [CONTACT_55257]. Hereafter, in this document ,
DOXIL/doxorubicin HCl liposome injection ([LOCATION_003] only) and CAELYX/PLD (non-[LOCATION_003]) will 
collectively berefer redtoas DOXIL .
Trabectedin and DOXIL, [ADDRESS_412806] shown efficacy  in 
treating women with advanced ovarian cancer. The combination of trabectedin and DOXIL has 
previously  been demonstrated in the ET743 -OVA -301 Phase 3 study to improve progression- free 
survival (PFS), as compared with DOXIL monotherapy , in the second -line treatment of 
refractory  ovarian cancer. Median overall survival (OS) was also increased by 3.3 months inthe 
combined trabectedin+DOXIL treatment arm, but this result did not reach statistical significance 
(p=0.08 35)4. Retrospective analy sis suggested that the efficacy  of the trabectedin+DOXIL 
combination was greatest insubjects with platinum -sensitive disease (subjects with a platinum -
free interval [PFI]6 months), and that the lack of statistical significance for OS may have 
resulted from an imbalance in prognostic factors. Thus, limiting treatment to patients with 
platinum -sensitive disease is expected to result in improved demonstrated efficacy , as well as an 
improved risk -benefit ratio.

Approved, 9 January 2018Study  ET743 -OVC -3006 is designed to investigate the activity  of trabectedin+DOXIL for the 
treatment of subjects with platinum -sensitive advanced- relapsed epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], primary 
peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351] . As second -line therapy  with a platinum- based combination 
regimen is now considered super ior to a single -agent in this patient population ,15this study  will 
compare the activit y of trabectedin+DOXIL to that of DOXIL monotherapy  in the third- line 
setting in subjects who have received [ADDRESS_412807] version of the Investigator's Brochure and Addenda for 
YONDELIS (trabectedin).21
The term "sponsor" used throughout this document refers to the entities listed in the Conta ct 
Information page(s), which will be provided as a separate document.
1.1. Trabectedin
Trabectedin is the first agent identified in a new cytotoxic class having a unique mechanism of 
action. Trabectedin binds to the minor groov e of DNA. In contrast to other DNA- interacting 
chemotherapeutic agents, which are most active in the S phase and have an enhanced activit y in 
NER -deficient cells, trabectedin is most active in the G1 phase and requires a functional 
transcription -coupled NER system todemonstrate activity .In vitro activity  was observed at 
concentrations in the nanomolar range prompting studies in animal models and eventually 
evaluation in subjects with ovarian cancer.
1.1.1. Human Pharmacokinetics of Trabectedin
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of trabectedin were evaluated after administration of a 1.3mg/m2
3-hIV infusion to subjects with advanced breast cancer (Study ET743 -INT-3).20Maximum 
plasma concentr ations were generall y observed at 1.[ADDRESS_412808] dose in Cycle 1 (1.3mg/m2), mean maximum plasma concentrations 
were approximately  6.3ng/mL. When the infusion was stopped, an initial rapid decline in 
plasma concentrations was observed, which was followed by a much slower decrease in 
concentrations. Mean systemic clearance rates of trabectedin ranged from 17L/h to 69L/h. The 
volume of distribution (mean: 4,860 L) was greater than total body  water, indicating that 
trabectedin distributes extensively  into peripheral tissues. The mean terminal half-life of this 
compound was [ADDRESS_412809] glucuronidation. On the basis of in vitro experiments, CYP3A4 is considered the 
predominant cy tochrome P450 enz yme responsible for the hepatic metabolism of trabectedin.21

Approved, 9 January [ZIP_CODE].2. Combination Therapy - Trabectedin + DOXIL
1.2.1. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_334288]743 -OVA -301 was a Phase 3, randomized, open -label, active -control, parallel -group, 
multicenter study  designed to assess the efficacy  and safet y of the trabectedin +DOXIL 
combination therap y when used to treat subjects with advanced -relapsed epi[INVESTIGATOR_92304].4The study  wasdesigned to determine whether or not the non-platinum, non-taxane 
combination of trabectedin+DOXIL would provide an option for patients who may  not b e able to 
receive further platinum -or taxane -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Subjects received either the 
trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy  every 3 weeks (DOX IL 30 mg/m2as a 90 minute 
infusion followed by 1.1 mg/m2of trabectedin as a 3h infusion) or DOXIL as a monotherapy  
every  4 weeks (DOX IL 50 mg/m2as a 90minute infusion). Subjects in the combination therapy 
arm were pretreated with IV dexamethasone (or an equivalent IV corticosteroid) . 
When compared with DOXIL monotherapy , the combination therap y of DOXIL andtrabectedin 
prolonged PFS for women with advanced -relapsed epi[INVESTIGATOR_334289]-
line platinum -based chemotherap y. The median PFS was 7.3months (95% confidence interval 
[CI]:5.9to7.9) for the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 5.8months (95% CI:5.5to7.1) for the 
DOXIL monotherapy  arm. The hazard ratio (HR)was 0.79 (95% CI:0.65 to 0.96, p=0.0190) 
which represented a 21% risk reduction in disease progression or death in the combination arm 
compared with DOXIL monotherap y (Figure 1).

Approved, 9 January 2018Median survival was 22.2 months for the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 18.9 months for the 
DOXIL arm, a 3.3 month improvement with the combination treatment. The HR was 0.86with 
95% CI: 0.72 to 1.02, and a p-value of 0.0835(un-stratified log-rank test) (Figure 2).An 
unexpected but significant imbalance in PFI favoring the DOXIL arm (mean PFI: 
DOXIL=13.3 months; trabectedin+DOXIL=10.6 months) was identified. On the basis of this 
finding, aretrospective analysis adjusting for the PFI imbalance and other prognostic factors 
suggested an improvement in OS associated with the trabectedin+DOXIL arm (HR=0.82; 95% 
CI: 0.69 to 0.98; p=0.0285).

1.2.2. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_334290]743- OVA -301, the safet y profile of the trabectedin+DOXIL combination therap y 
was consistent with the well-characterized toxicities seen with each agent alone.4The incidence 
of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, drug-related serious adverse events, and advers e events leading 
to treatment termination were higher for the trabectedin+DOXIL combination arm than for the 
DOXIL monotherapy  arm. Death due to adverse events was infrequent, occurring in 2 (1%) 
subjects in the DOXIL monotherap yarm and in 5 (2%) subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm. 
No subjects developed myelodysplasias or acute myeloid leukemia during the study . Treatment 
with the combination of trabectedin+DOXIL primarily  resulted in additional myelosuppression 
and liver enzy me abnormalities, both of which did not usually  result in serious clinical sequelae. 
The incidence of Grades 3 and 4 adverse events for neutropenia was higher in the 
trabectedin+DOXIL arm (63%) compared with DOXIL monotherapy  (23%). In the 
trabectedin+DOXI L arm 8% of subjects developed Grade 3 or 4 neutropenic fever compared 
with 2% in DOXIL monotherapy  arm. Neutropenia was managed by  [CONTACT_334320] s and reductions, 
as well as the use of colony  stimulating agents.
The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 alanine aminotran sferase (ALT) was 1% in the DOXIL 
monotherap y arm and 32% in the trabectedin+DOXIL  arm.4This was not unexpected, because 
acute, transient elevation s in both ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) have been 
associated with single -agent trabectedin. Transaminase elevations were generally  of short 
duration, usually  returning to normal before the next cycle. In addition, in most cases, it 
decreased in incidence and magnitude in subsequent cycles, and did not result in severe liver 
toxicity  or failure. Transaminase elevations were generally  managed by[CONTACT_334321] s.4,21
The overall incidence of increased blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) adverse events was 
11(3%) subjects in the DOXIL monotherapy  arm and 24(7%) subjects in the 
trabectedin+DOXIL arm. The incidence of rhabdom yolysis, a potential complication of

respectivel y. The overall incidenc e of renal and urinary  disorder adverse events was 8% of 
subjects in the DOXIL monotherap yarm and 10% of subjects in the trabectedin+ DOXIL arm.
The incidence of cardiac dysfunction , measured as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) from baseline to treatment termination, were comparable between the 
trabectedin +DOXIL combination therapy  arm and the DOXIL monotherap y arm (6% vs 8%, 
respectivel y). The incidence of hand and foot syndrome (HFS) (26 % vs 54%) , stomatitis
(20% vs33%) , mucosal inflammation (13% vs 20%), and abdominal pain (22% vs 24%) were all 
reduced , respectivel y, as might be expected with the lower dose of DOXIL (30mg/m2) in the

1.4. Overall Rationale for the Study
Single -agent activit y of trabectedin has been studied in several Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies. 
Trabectedin had a favorable safet yprofile and promising activity  in recurrent ovarian cancer 
patients.10,17Pooled analysi s of 3 Phase 2 studies showed a response rate of 34% and time-to-
progressio n (TTP)of 5.8months in subjects who had a PFIof [ADDRESS_412812] 
platinum -based therap y.11No efficacy difference was seen between the patients with 2 prior lines 
of platinum- based therapy  and patients with only  1 prior platinum -based therap y.

YONDELIS(trabectedin)
Clinical Protocol ET743 -OVC -3006 – Amendment [ADDRESS_412813] -line chemotherapy . The l ong-term follow -up from a multicenter Phase 3 study  comparing 
DOXIL with topotecan demonstrated an 18% reduction in the risk of death for subjects treated 
with DOXIL (median survival 62.7 weeks compared with 59.7 weeks for topotecan -treated 
subjects; H R: 1.216; 95% CI : 1.000 to 1.478; p=0.050). 8,9
In the Phase 1 Study  ET743- [LOCATION_003] -11, thetrabectedin +DOXIL combination therap y was 
administered to subjects with a variety  of tumor types. The recommended dose level was 
trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2and DOXIL 30 mg/m2, administered once every  3 weeks ( q3wk ).19
In the Phase 3 Study  ET743- OVA- 301, the efficacy and safety of the trabectedin+DOXIL
combination therap y was assessed insubjects with first-relapsed ovarian cancer after 
platinum -based chemotherap y. In this study ,672 subjects were randomly  assigned to receive 
DOXIL 30 mg/m2followed by a 3-hinfusion of trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2every 3 weeks or DOXIL 
50 mg/m2every  4  w eeks as a monotherapy . The median PFS was 7.3 months with the 
trabectedin+DOXIL combination therap y vs 5.8 months with the DOXIL monotherapy 
(HR:0.79; 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.96; p=0190). The median OS for trabectedin+DOXIL and DOXIL 
monotherap y arms was 22.2 months and 18.9 months , respectively (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.72 to 
1.02; p=0.0835 [un-stratified log-rank test]) .4,13In an unplanned subset analy sis, an unexpected 
but significant imbalance in the PFI favoring the DOXIL monotherapy  arm was identified (mean 
PFI: DOXIL arm=13.3 months; trabectedin+DOXIL arm=10.6 months). On the basis of this 
finding, a retrospective analy sis adjusting for the PFI imbalance and other prognostic factors was 
performed, which suggested an improvement in OS associated with the trabectedin+DOXIL arm 
(HR: 0.82; 95% CI:0.69 to 0.98; p=0.0285).14Within the trabectedin+DOXIL combination arm, 
neutropenia (78% vs 39%) and Grade 3 to 4 transaminase elevations (ie, ALT: 32% vs 1%) were 
more commonly  observed, while HFS (26% vs 54%) and mucositis (13% vs 20%) were less 
frequent lyobserved than with in the DOXIL monotherap yarm.[ADDRESS_412814] received 2 prior lines of

3. STUDY DESIGN A ND RA TIONA LE
3.1. Overview  of Study  Design
This is a randomized, open -label, active -controlled, multicenter study  designed toassess the 
efficacy  and safety  of trabectedin+DOXIL as a third- line chemotherapy  in subjects with 
platinum -sensitive advanced- relapsed epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], primary  peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_204605] 2 previous lines of platinum -based chemotherap y. Approximately  670 adult 
subjects will be enrolled in this study ,with 335 subjects per plann ed treatment group .At
randomization, subjects will be stratified by4 criteria : 1)the time from the last dose of first-line 
platinum therap y to disease progression (6months to12months vs >12months to 24months vs 
>24months) , 2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) performance status grade
(0vs1), 3) BRCA 1/2 status (mutation vs no mutation ), and 4) prior DOXIL therapy  (no vs yes).
Subjects will then be randomly  assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the trabectedin+DOXIL combination 
therap y group (Arm A) or to the DOXIL monotherapy  group (Arm B) .
During the treatment phase, subjects will receive study  drug by [CONTACT_95077]  1 of a 21 -day 
cycle in Arm A and on Day 1 of a 28-day cycle in Arm B. Treatment will continue until the 
occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable treatment toxicity , or until 2 cycles after 
assessment of a complete response (CR) . Subjects assigned to the trabectedin+DOXIL group
(Arm A)will be pretreated with 20 mg of dexamethasone IV, or anequivalent IV corticoster oid, 
approximately  30minutes prior to initiation ofinfusion of DOXIL on Day 1 of each treatment 
cycle.

observed or up to the clinical cutoff date.An interim analy sis isplanned for this study (after 
observing 60% [308 death events ]of the total number of required [514]death events ) to 
determine whether efficacy  has been adequately  demonstrated, allowing for early  study 
termination and subject crossover from the monotherapy  arm. Given the findings from Study 
ET743- OVA-301, which demonstrated superior PFS and a favorable survival trend for the 
trabectedin+DOXIL combination therap y, there are no plans to conduct a futility  analysis at the 
interim analy sis.
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints of PFS and ORR will be assessed using the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST, Version 1.1 ). Scheduled assessments of disease status will be
performed within 30 days before randomization, every  8 weeks ( 5days) after randomization for 
the first 4 assessments, and then every  12 weeks (5days)thereafter. Disease assessments, 
including assessments for subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease 
progression, will be performed until disease progression is radiographically confirmed , the start 
of subsequent anticancer therap y,withdrawal of subject consent, or the clinical cutoff date. For 
subjects who discontinue study  treatment, documentation of all subsequent anticancer therap y,
survival status, and safety  evaluations as outlined in the Time and Events Schedule will be
requi red. Survival status should be recorded at least every  8weeks for the first 2years after the 
treatment termination visit and approximately  every  [ADDRESS_412816] been observed or until the clinical cutoff date.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is OS, defined as the time between randomization and death from 
any cause. Secondary  endpoints are PFS (defined as the time between the date of randomization 
and the date of disease progress ion or death) ,and ORR (defined as the proportion of subjects 
who achieve CR or partial response [ PR]).
Safety  will be assessed using laboratory  test results and the incidence and severity  of adverse 
events. Left ventricular ejection fraction assessments (either multigated acquisition [MUGA]
scans or 2-dimensional echocardiograms [2D- ECHO ])and electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be 
used to monitor cardiac function.
An IDMC will assess safet y and efficacy  data (Section 11.9, Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee ). Safet y data will be reviewed approximately  every  [ADDRESS_412817] extensive

futility  of 0.93. In view of this result and the observed and expected higher toxicity  in Arm A as 
compared with Arm B, the IDMC recommended discontinuing the study . Therefore, as of 
Amendment 6, no new subjects will be randomized to study  treatment, and treatment with 
trabectedin should be immediately  discontinued for subjects assigned to Arm A 
(trabectedin+DOXIL). All study  subjects (Arm A or Arm B) currently  on study  who, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , are deriving clinical benefit may  continue treatment with single -agent 
DOXIL as per the local standard of care. Treatment for these subjects may continue as long as 
the subjects comply  with protocol -specified prohibitions and restrictions for treatment

Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection
A population PK model has been developed using data from 15 studies performed in patients 
with solid malignancies, including 3 studies (ET-743-INT-11, ET-B-009-9, and ET-OVA- 301) 
in subjects with ovarian cancer. Blood samples for population PK analysis will be collected 
using a sparse sampling scheme from at least 40 subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL combination 
treatment group. These data will be analy zed using a population PK model to characterize the PK 
of trabectedin in the patient population enrolled in the present stud y.

Treatment Allocation
Procedures for Stratification and Randomization
Prior to randomization, inclusion criteria #4 through #8must be reviewed by [CONTACT_3211]’s medical 
monitor (Section 4.1, Inclusion Criteria ). Following sponsor review, s ubjects will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_334327]-line platinum therap y to disease progression (6 months to

(0vs1), BRCA 1/2 status (mutation vs no mutation), and prior DOXIL therapy  (no vs yes). 
Central randomization will be implemented in this study . Randomization of subjects should 
occur as close in time as possible before administration of the first dose of study  drug(s) and 
must occur within [ADDRESS_412837] dose of study  treatment. This 
maximum 7-day window is given to allow time for provision of central venous access for those 
subjects assigned to Treatment Arm A (Section 6, Dosage and Administration). Subjects will be 
randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to 1 of 2treatment groups based on a computer -generated 
randomization schedule prepared before the study  by [CONTACT_43754].

Blinding
The requirement of a central venous catheter, limited to the combination trabectedin+DOXIL 
arm, precludes blinded treatment in this study . This study will therefore be conducted as an 
open -label stud y.
6. DOSA GE A ND A DMINISTRA TION
Janssen Research & Development (JR&D) will provide trabectedin and DOXIL as IV
formulations. The amount (in mg) of trabectedin and DOXIL to be administered will be 
determined by [CONTACT_334328] (BSA), which will be calculated according to the 
standard nomogram used at each center. Body surface area will be calculated either at Screeni ng 
or on Day [ADDRESS_412839] has a significant weight change (approximately  >10%). For 
those subject s with a body  mass index (BMI) 30, the use of ideal body  weight for dose 
calculation and cappi[INVESTIGATOR_334296]. The calculated dose of DOXIL  may  be rounded to 
the nearest full mg that can be administered accurately . The dose of trabectedin may be rounded 
to the nearest second decimal place (eg,1.721 can be rounded to 1.72) that can be administered 
accuratel y. The first dose of study  drug may be administered at any time within [ADDRESS_412840] is 
assigned to the trabectedin+DOXIL arm of the study . 
Treatment Arm A: DOXIL 30 mg/m2administered as an IVinfusion over approximately
90minutes (per package insert) followed by [CONTACT_334310] 1.1 mg/m2administered as anIV
infusion over approximately  3h, via central venous access, every  [ADDRESS_412841] infusion, DOXIL  may be administered as a 60-to 90-minute infusion in 
subsequent cy cles.
All subjects assigned to Treatment Arm A will be premedicated with 20 mg dexamethasone, 
adminis tered IV approximatel y 30 minutes before the start of the DOXIL infusion, to reduce the 
incidence of transaminase elevation related to trabectedin. If dexamethasone is not available, an 
equivalent IV dose of another corticosteroid may be substituted. For subjects in Treatment Arm A, 
trabecte din will be administered as an IV infusion over approximatel y 3himmediatel y after the 
catheter is flushed well with 5% dextrose in water (D5W). Trabectedin should be diluted in normal 
saline or D5W to a volume of at least 500 mL and infused via a central venous catheter. Any 
calibrated infusion pump may be used to deliver the drug. The administration of both drugs will be 
repeated every  3 weeks. The prophy lactic use of granulocy te-colon y stimulating factor (G-CSF) is 
strongly recommended for those subjects assigned to Treatment Arm A.

Treatment Arms A and B:
For both treatment arms, ascheduled dosing window of +2dayswill beallowed for 
administrative purposes (eg, clinic scheduling, national holiday , patient's daughter is getting 
married) . Administration of study  drugwithin this window will not be considered a dosing delay 
and should not be recorded as such on the case report form ( CRF) unless the delay is to allow for 
recovery  from an adverse event .Detailed information on the requirements for storage, 
reconstitution and dilution, accountabilit y, and disposal of trabectedin can be found in the 
Investigator Broc hure.
Treatment Options –Amendment 6:
For subjects assigned to Arm A (trabectedin+DOXIL), treatment with trabectedin should be 
immediately  discontinued. All study  subjects (Arm A or Arm B) currently  on study  who, in the
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , are deriving clinical benefit may continue treatment with single -agent 
DOXIL as per the local standard of care. Treatment for these subjects may continue as long as 
the subjects comply  with protocol -specified prohibitions and restrictions for treatment 
(Section 4.3) and as long as they experience clinical benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] . 
DOXIL will be provided by  [CONTACT_334315]&D as needed until post -trial access to DOXIL is available or 
until disease progression, whichever occurs first .

9.4.1. Mandatory  BRCA  1 and BRCA  2Mutation A nalysis
Reporting of BRCA 1/2status will be required prior to randomization and is to be collected on 
the CRF . For subjec ts who do not have a known BRCA 1/2status, a blood sample will be 
collected, and BRCA 1/2status determined within 30 days prior torandomization .It is expected 
that BRCA 1/2 analy sis will require approximately  10 to 14 days. In the case of delay ed 
BRCA 1/2 mutation reporting, the screening period may be extended for up to 14 days (with 
medical monitor approval). In such cases, only screening clinical laboratory  assessments 
(hematology , clinical chemistry , and liver panel) will need to be repeated. Because there are 
multiple possible mutations for any one subject, stratification will be based on the presence of a 
BRCA 1/2mutation (mutation vs no mutation).
For subjects with a known mutation status for either BRCA 1 or BRCA 2, but not for both genes, 
the result from the single gene tested will be captured in the CRF. If thestatus of the reported 
gene indicates a mutation, the status will be used forrandomization. However, if the single gene 
tested indicates no mutation, thenBRCA testing for the other gene is to be conducted and 
reported within 30 day s prior to randomization.
9.4.2. Optional Pharmacogenomic Analyses
Subjects will be given the opportunity to participate in the optional pharmacogenomic 
component of this study , where local regulations permit. Collection of pharmacogenomic 
samples will allow for genetic research to help understand trabectedin/DOXIL activity  in 
advanced- relapsed epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], primary  peritoneal, and fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_84533]. Genetic 
analysis will be conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help resolve issues with the clinical

10. SUBJECT COMPLETION/WITHDRA WAL
10.1. Completion
A subject will be considered to have completed the study  if she has experienced a clinical 
endpoint that precludes further study  (eg, mortality  in a mortalit y endpoint study )or has 
withdrawn consent for follow -up.Following the completion of the treatment termination visit
assessments on or by [ADDRESS_412891] of care, only 
serious adverse events should be reported to JR&D as outlined in Section 12.3.2 .

Approved, 9 January 201810.2. Discontinuation of Treatment 
As of Amendment 6, treatment with trabectedin should be immediately  discontinued for subjects 
assigned to Arm A (trabectedin+DOXIL). All study  subjects (Arm A or Arm B) currently  on 
study  who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], are deriving clinical benefit may  continue treatment 
with single -agent DOXIL as per the local standard of care. Treatment for these subjects may 
continue as long as the subjects comply  with protocol -specified prohibitions and restrictions for
treatment (Section 4.3) and as long as they experience clinical benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070]. DOXIL will be provided by [CONTACT_37738]&D as needed until post-trial access to DOXIL is 
available or until disease progression, whichever occurs first.
If a subject's study  treatment must be discontinued before disease progress ion has been
documented , this will not result in automatic withdrawal of the subject from the study . 
A subject's study  treatment should bediscontinue d if:
The subject has disease progression,
The subject meets protocol prescribed criteria for drug discontinuation due to toxicity  after 
appropriate dose reductions (Section 6.2),
The subject does not meet the criteria for continuation of treatment (Section 6.1),
The subject develops a concurrent medical condition (adverse event) that precludes further 
participation,
The subject begins a subsequent anticancer therapy ,
The subject completes 2 cycles of treatment after assessment of a CR,
Thesubject requests to stop receiving treatm ent, or
The subject becomes pregnant.
If a subject discontinues study  treatment before disease progression has occurred , end-of-
treatment assessments should be obtained, and follow -up for scheduled assessments (eg, survival 
and radiographic disease assessments) should be continued.
10.3. Withdrawal From the Study
A subject will be withdrawn from the stud y for any of the following reasons:
Lost to follow -up
Withdrawal of consent (no further treatment and no further follow-up)
If a subject is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort must be made by  [CONTACT_334334]/withdrawal and survival 
status. The measures taken to follow up must be documented.

Clinical Protocol ET743 -OVC -3006 – Amendment [ADDRESS_412892] the following options regarding the optional
pharmacogenomic research sample :
The collected sample will be retained and used in accordance with the subject's original 
separate informed consent for optional research samples .
The subject may withdraw consent for optional research samples, in which case the sample 
will be destroy ed and no further testing will take place. To initiate the sample destruction 
process, the investigator must notify the sponsor site contact [CONTACT_334335]. The sponsor study  site 
contact [INVESTIGATOR_1318], in turn, conta ct the biomarker representative to execute sample destruction. If 
requested, the investigator will receive written confirmation from the sponsor that the 
sample has been destro yed.
Withdrawal From the Optional Research Samples While Remaining in the Main S tudy
The subject may  withdraw consent for optional research samples while remaining in the study . In 
such a case, the optional research sample will be destroy ed. The sample destruction process will 
proceed as described above. However, all samples will be made nonidentifiable after the Clinical 
Study  Report is issued and thereafter cannot be identified for destruction. If the sample has 
alread y undergone conversion to the nonidentifiable format, the sponsor will notify  the 
investigator in writing.
11. STATISTICA L METHODS
Statistical analy sis will be done by [CONTACT_43758]. A general 
description of the statistical methods to be used to anal yze the efficacy  and safet y data is outlined 
below. Specific details will be provided in th e Statistical Analy sis Plan.
11.1. Subject Information
For all subjects who are randomly  assigned to study  drug descriptive statistics will be provided .
11.2. Sample Size Determination
This study  is designed to demonstrate a statistically  significant difference in OS between subjects 
treated with the trabectedin+DOXIL combination therap y and those treated with the DOXIL 
monotherap yin the third -line setting .The OS endpoint will incorporate group sequential design 
by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] 1 interim analy sis and 1 final analy sis using the O’Brien -Fleming boundaries as
implemented by [CONTACT_290941]-DeMets α-spending method. It is assumed that failure will follow an 
exponential distribution with a constant hazard rate. Assuming a median OS of 16months for the 
active control group (DOXIL monot herap y), a  p lanned sample size of approximately  
670subjects will provide 80% power to detect a HRof 0.78 (16months vs 20.5months) at a 
2-tailed significance level of 0.05 and anenroll ment duration of approximately  52months

Approved, 9 January 2018(13subjects/month enrollme nt) over a total study duration of 64months to obtain the required 
514events.
11.3. Efficacy  Analyses
All efficacy  endpoints will be analy zed using the All Randomized set of the population. The 
Kaplan -Meier product limit method and un-stratified Cox proportional hazards model will be 
used to estimate the time-to-event variables and to obtain the HR and their 95% CI. The 
un-stratified log-rank test will be used as the primary analysis for treatment comparison. The 
response rate variable swill be evaluated using Chi-square statistic (un-stratified) .
Sensitivity  analyses for the primary  endpoint using the stratified log-rank test will also be 
performed. Subgroup analy ses will be carried out to assess if the treatment effect is consistent 
across clinicall y relevant subgroups.
Primary Endpoint
Overall survival is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. 
Subjects who die, regardless of the cause of death, will be considered to have had an event. 
Subjects who are still being treated, who are losttofollow -up prior to the end of the study ,or 
who have withdrawn consent from the study  will be censored at the last available date where the 
subject is known to be alive. 
Overall survival will be compared between both treatment arms by [CONTACT_220441]-stratified , 2-sided, 
log-rank test. The analy sis of the primary  endpoint, OS, will be conducted after at least 
514events (deaths) are observed or until the clinical cutoff date. An interim analy sis is planned 
for this study ; after observing 60% (308 death events) of the total number of required (514) death 
events. The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution of functions of OS for 
each treatment arm. The number of events, subjects censored, the estimate of medians, and 95% 
CI for the medians will be presented. Survival rates will be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier 
method. The un-stratified Cox proportional hazards model will be used to obtain the HR and its
95% CI .
Overall survival will also be compared between the treatment arms by a 2-sided log-rank test, 
stratified for: the time from the last dose of first-line platinum therapy to disease progression 
(6months to 12 months vs >12 months to 24 months vs >24 month s), ECOG performance status 
grade (0 vs 1), BRCA 1/2 status (mutation vs no mutation) , andprior DOXIL therapy  (no vs 
yes).
In case an imbalance in baseline prognostic factors is observed, especiall y PFI, a Cox 
proportional hazards model will also be used to compare the 2 treatment arms. The following 
baseline information inclu des as covariates: baseline ECOG (0 vs 1), PFI (as continuous), BRCA 
1/2 status (mutation vs no mutation), prior DOXIL  therapy  (no vs yes), and anyimbalanced 
factor s. From the Cox proportional hazards regression, HR estimates and their 95% CIs will be 
estimated for treatment and for the prognostic factors.

started subsequent therapy  for ovarian cancer and still alive) will be censored at the date of the 
last tumor assessment (prior to or on the first day of the first subsequent therap y for ovarian 
cancer).
Progression- free survival will be compare d between both treatment arms using the un-stratified
log-rank test.The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution function of PFS 
for each treatment arm. The number of events, subjects censored, the estimate of medians, and 
95% CIs for the medians will be presented. Six-month and 1-year progression -freerates will be 
calculated using the Kaplan- Meier product limit method.
Objec tive response rate is defined asthe total number of subjects with either a CR or PRas 
defined by [CONTACT_393] (Version 1.1). All other subjects will be considered non-responders in the 
analysis. The response rate will be evaluated using the Chi -square statistic (un -stratified).
The ECOG value at the end of treatment visit will be tabulated (not cross -tabulated against the 
baseline value). The listing will contain both E COG values.
Hierarchical Testing
In the event that the primary  endpoint of OS is significant, the Hochberg procedure will be used 
to hierarchically  test the secondary  endpoints at the overall (2-sided) significance level 0.05. 
11.4. Pharmacokinetic A nalyses
Sparse PK data will be listed in the population PK-report, for all subjects with available 
concentrations in the trabectedin+DOXIL treatment group. Subjects will be excluded from the 
PK analy sis if their data do not allow for accurate assessment of the PK (eg, improper hand ling 
of PK samples, incomplete administration of the study  agent; missing time or dosing 
information). All concentrations below the lowest quantifiable concentration or missing data will 
be labeled as such in the concentration data presentat ion. All subjects and samples excluded from 
the analysis will be retained in the dataset but will be flagged out and the criteria for exclusion 
documented. 
Population PK anal ysis of plasma concentration -time data of trabectedin will be performed using 
nonlinear mixed -effects modeling. Data may  be combined with those of a selection of Phase 1, 2, 
and [ADDRESS_412894] characteristics 
(demographics, laboratory  variables, genot ypes, concurrent dexamethasone use, etc.) will be 
tested as potential covariates affecting PK parameters. Details will be given in a population PK 
analysis plan and the results of the population PK anal ysis will be presented in a separate report.

Differences between thetreatment arms will be evaluated using published methods. Specific 
interest centers onabdominal and gastrointestinal sy mptom scales of QL Q-OV28 . The change in 
PRO scores between baseline and each postbaseline assessment will be described overall and 
according to the response to treatment. 
11.6. Pharmacogenomic A nalyses
BRCA 1/2status will be evaluated for association with time-to-event endpoints (eg, OS and 
PFS) using the log-rank test. Response rate may also be evaluated using the appropriate 
categorical method. Analy ses will be performed within and between each treatment group. The 
Kaplan -Meier method and Cox model will be used to obtain a HR and its 95% CI. Other clinical 
covariates, such as race, age, a nd tumor burden ma y also be included in the model.
11.7. Safety  Analyses
All subjects who ha ve received at least part of 1dose of study  drug will be included in the safety 
analysis, according to the actual treatment received. The safet y parameters to be evaluat ed are 
the incidence, intensity , and type of adverse events, ECGs, LVE F assessments (MUGA scans or 
2D-ECHOs), and clinical laboratory  results. Exposure to the study  drugs and reasons for 
discontinuation of study  treatment will be tabulated.
Adverse Events
The verbatim terms used in the CRF by [CONTACT_23820] (MedDRA) and will be graded according 
to the NCI-CTCAE, Version 4.0. All reported adverse events with onset during the treatment 
phase (ie, those events that occur or worsen on or after the first dose of study  drug up through 
30days after the last dose of study  drug) will be included in the analy sis. Adverse events will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_14340]. For each adverse event, the 
percentage of subjects who experience at least 1occurrence of the given event will be 
summarized overall and by [CONTACT_1570]. Serious adverse events and deaths will be listed. All 
adverse events resulti ng in discontinuation of study  treatment, dose modification, the interruption

AnIDMC will be established toreview the efficacy  and safet y data according to the prescribed 
statistical plan. The committee willmeet periodically  (approximately  every 6 months) to review 
safet y data. After the review, the IDMC will make recommendations regarding the continuation 
of the study . The details will be provided in a separate IDMC charter.
The committee will consist of members who are not employ ees of the sponsor and are not 
otherwise involved in the conduct of the study. The membership will include one or more
statistician sandmedical oncologists with experience in treating subj ects with ovarian cancer . 
Note: On 26June [ADDRESS_412896], study data up to 
20September 2017 were evaluated for safet y and OS (45% rather than 60% of the required death 
events at the planned interim analysis). Following the review of the study data by [CONTACT_334305] 
15 December 2017, the HR for OS was 0.962, crossing the previously  agreed upon threshold for 
futility  of 0.93. In view of this result and the observe d and expected higher toxicity in Arm A as 
compared with Arm B, the IDMC recommended discontinuing the study .Therefore, as of 
Amendment 6, no new subjects will be randomized to study  treatment, and treatment with 
trabectedin should be immediately  discontinued for subjects assigned to Arm A 
(trabectedin+DOXIL). All study  subjects (Arm A or Arm B) currently  on study  who, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , are deriving clinical benefit may  continue treatment with single -agent

DOXIL will be provided by [CONTACT_37738]&D as needed until post-trial access to DOXIL is available or 
until disease progression, whichever occurs first.
12. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
Following Amendment 6, only serious adverse events for subjects continuing to receive single -
agent DOXIL should be reported to JR&D as outlined in Section 12.3.[ADDRESS_412898] Operating Procedures in 
conformity  with regulatory  requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y 
information; all clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_43765].
12.1. Definitions
12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not nece ssaril y 
have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any  unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not 
related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per 
International Conference forHarmonisation [I CH])
This includes any  occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test 
abnormalities.
Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing of the ICF (refer to 
Section 12.3.[ADDRESS_412899] adverse event recording).
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medic inal 
Products for Human Use is any  untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.)

Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a m edicinal product
Is Medicall y Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23738]. 
These should usually  be considered serious.
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Saf ety Information
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity  is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safet y information . For trabectedin , the expectedness of an adverse 
event will be determined by  [CONTACT_334337] l isted in the Investigator's Brochure. For DOXIL , 
the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_334338] f or Human Use Summary  of Product 
Characteristics.
Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Drug
An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible, 
probable, or very  likel yby [CONTACT_23826] 12.1.2 , Attribution Definitions .
12.1.2. Attribution Definitions
Not Related
An adverse event that is not related to the use of the drug.
Doubtful
An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), 
concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely .
Possible
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanation, 
eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded.
Probable
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive 
(eg,confirme d by [CONTACT_23827]). An alternative explanation is less likely, eg,concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s).

12.2. Special Reporting Situations
Safety  events of interes t on a sponsor study  drugthat may require expedited reporti ng and/or 
safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
Overdose of a sponsor study  drug
Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study  drug
Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a sponsor study  drug
Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to 
the sponsor study  drug , eg, name [CONTACT_2976])
Up to and including 18 January 2018, s pecial reporting situations should be recorded in the CRF . 
After 18 January 2018, a ny special reporting situation that meets the criteria ofa serious adverse 
event should be reported to JR&D using the Serious Adverse Event Form (Section 12.3.2 ).
12.3. Procedures
12.3.1. All Adverse Events
All adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, will be 
reported from the time a signed and dated ICFis obtained until [ADDRESS_412900] be recorded using medical terminology  in the source document and the CRF . Whenever 
possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology 
(eg,cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as "upper

Clinical Protocol ET743 -OVC -3006 – Amendment [ADDRESS_412901] be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor 
instructions.
The sponsor assumes responsibility  for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory  
authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational 
institute where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs). The 
investigator (or sponsor where required) must report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the appropriate Independent 
Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/I RB) that approved the protocol unless 
otherwise required and documented b y the IEC/IRB.
Subjects (or their designees, if appropriate) must be provided with a "wallet (study)card" and 
instructed to carry  this card with them for the duration of the study  indicating the following: 
Study  number
Investigator's name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24-hour contact [CONTACT_23828]
Local sponsor's name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] [ADDRESS_412902] telephone number (for medical staff only )
Statement, in the local language(s), that the subject is participating in a clinical study .
Site number
Subject number
12.3.2. Serious A dverse Events
All serious adverse events o ccurring during the study must be reported to the appropriat e sponsor 
contact [CONTACT_9702] b y stud y-site personnel within [ADDRESS_412903] be completed and signed by a physician from the study  site, 
and transmitted to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow -up reports of a serious 
adverse event should be made b y facsimile (fax) .
All serious adverse events that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's 
participation in the study , must be followed until any  of the following occurs:
The event resolves
The event stabilizes (as noted in Section 9.5).
The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available
The event can be attributed to agents other than the study  drug or to factors unrelated to 
study  conduct
It becomes unlikely  that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after demonstration 
of due diligence with follow-up efforts)

Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product will be reported as a 
serious adverse event. Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
that occurs during the course of a subject's participation in a study  must be reported as a serious 
adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] (eg, social reasons 
such as pe nding placement in long -term care facility ).
Surgery  or procedure planned before entry  into the study  (must be documented in the CRF). 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23743], and where the 
underly ing condition for which the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23744], will not 
be considered serious adverse events. Any  adverse event that results in a prolongation of the

For reasons described in the protocol, eg, study  drug administration, protocol -required 
testing.
For the administration of blood or platelet transfusion. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72613] a complication of such transfusion remains a reportable serious adverse 
event.
As part of a procedure for protocol/disease related investigations (eg, surgery , scans, 
endoscop y, sampling for laboratory  tests, bone marrow sampling). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57893] a complication of such a procedure remains a reportable 
serious adverse event.
The cause of death of a subject in astudy  within [ADDRESS_412904] dose of study  drug, whether or 
not the event is expected or associated with the study  drug , is considered a serious adverse event.
Disease progression should not be recorded as an adverse event or serious adverse event term; 
instead, signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression/lack of 
efficacy  will be reported if they fulfill the serious adverse event definition (see Section 12.1.1 , 
Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications ).
12.3.3. Pregnancy  
All initial reports of pregnancy  must be reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_1758] -site personnel 
within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the Pregnancy Notification Form. 
Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomal ies, and ectopic pregnancy ) are considered serious adverse events and must be reported 
using the Serious Adverse Event Form. Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study 
must be promptly  withdrawn from the study . Follow -up information regarding the outcome of 
the pregnancy  and an y postnatal sequelae i n the infant will be required .

16. ETHICA L ASPECTS
16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations
The current trial is a randomized, open -label study . As the experimental agent trabectedin is 
administered via a central catheter, for ethical reasons the comparator control is generall y 
administered via a peripheral vein. The study  is open label because blinding of the treatment 
arms is not possible due to the mode of administration and administration schedules of the study  
drugs. The single -agent arm (DOX IL) has a slightly  higher dose of DOXIL (dose as per the 
product package insert) while the combination (trabectedin+DOXIL) combines the 2agents at 
lower doses . Criteria for further dose adjustments are outlined for each study  arm. The study 
population is well defined (subjects with platinum-sensitive advanced- relapsed epi[INVESTIGATOR_12248], primary  peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_334285] 2 previous lines of 
platinum -based chemotherap y) and will receive the standard of care therapy  in both arms of the 
trial. Subjects will be fully informed of the potential risks of treatment with the study  drugs, and 
can withdraw consent at any  time.

Clinical Protocol ET743 -OVC -3006 – Amendment 6

Approved, 9 January 2018The trabectedin+DOXIL combination t herapy has shown better efficacy (prolonged PFS) than 
DOXIL monotherap y in the second -line treatment of refractory ovarian cancer in 
Study ET743- OVA -301. Based on a retrospective analysis of OS in Study  ET743 -OVA -301, 
subjects with platinum -sensitive disease who receive the trabectedin+DOXIL combination 
therap y may also experience prolonged survival. Because trabectedin is added to DOXIL, the 
combination therap y is expected to result in a higher incidence of some adverse events when 
compared to the DOXIL monotherap y comparator arm.
The retrospective analysis of OS data in Study ET743- OVA-301 indicates that the lack of 
statistical significance for OS resulted from an imbalance in prognostic factors (PFI) at 
randomization. BRCA 1/2 mutation status is a key prognostic factor in ovarian cancer15,16. 
Therefore, subjects in this study will be stratified by [CONTACT_76390] 1/2 mutation status (mutation vs no 
mutation). The mutation status will only be used to stratify  the subjects to treatment 
(trabectedin+DOXIL or DOXIL). Depending upon the region, it is expected that as many  as 50% 
of potenti al subjects will have a known BRCA 1/[ADDRESS_412909] medical practice to assess genetic risk to specific cancers15,16. For those subjects without 
a known BRCA 1/2 status, genetic analysis of BRCA 1/[ADDRESS_412910] for routine 
laboratory  evaluations throughout the study  will be approximately  15 mL for screening serum 
chemistry  and hematology  tests; 10mL for BRCA 1/2testing at screening (for subjects who do 
not have a known BRCA 1/2 status) ; 4 mL for subjects consenting to the optional 
pharmacogenomics component of the study  (where local regulations permit) ; 45 mL and 60 mL 
for treatment Arms A and B, respectivel y, per cycle for serum biochemistry  and hematology  
tests; 4 mL per scheduled CA-125 sample ;and 24 mL from those subjects who provide PK 
samples. Overall, the volume of blood to be drawn is deemed reasonable over the time frame of 
the study . An IDMC will follow safet y and efficacy  during the study  at regular intervals 
(approximately  every 6 months ) and in the prespecified interim analy sis, respectivel y.
Note: Following the review of the study  data by  [CONTACT_941] I DMC on 15 December 2017, the HR for OS 
was 0.962, crossing the previously  agreed upon threshold for futility  of 0.93. In view of this
result and the observ ed and expected higher toxicity  in Arm A as compared with Arm B, the 
IDMC recommended discontinuing the study . Therefore, as of Amendment 6, no new subjects 
will be randomized to study  treatment, and treatment with trabectedin should be immediatel y 
discontinued for subjects assigned to Arm A (trabectedin+DOXIL). All study  subjects (Arm A or 
Arm B) currentl y on study  treatment who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , are deriving clinical 
benefit may continue treatment with single -agent DOXIL as per the local standard of care. 
Treatment for these subjects may  continue as long as the subjects comply  with protocol-specified 
prohibitions and restrictions for treatment (Section 4.3) and as long as they experience clinical

post-trial access to DOXIL is available or until disease progression , whichever occurs firs t.
All subjects still on study treatment should be informed of the reasons for the discontinuation of 
the study , and the potential risks andbenefits ofcontinued treatment with single -agent DOXIL
should be discussed.
Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study  and, during the 
study , subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue 
participation. They  will be told that their consent to partici pate in the study  is voluntary  and may  be 
withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they 
would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and 
potential advers e events of the study , and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled.

Guidelines for CRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study -sitepersonnel before 
the start of the study .The sponsor will review CRFs for accuracy  and completeness during 
on-site monitoring visits and after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved 
with the investigator or designee, as appropriate. After the upload of the data into the study 
database, they  will be verified for accuracy  and consistency  with the data sour ces.
17.7. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all CRFs 
and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study  
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s). 
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be 
retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_43785]. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_13274], custod y must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877]. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study  
documents before havin g obtained written approval from the sponsor .

Approved, 9 January 2018If it becomes necessary  for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory  authority  to review any 
documentation relating to this study , the investigator /institution must permit access to such 
reports.
17.8. Monitoring
The sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site 
monitoring) to monitor the study .
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will 
record dates of the visits in a study  site visit log that will be kept at the study  site. The first 
post-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, 
the monitor will compare the data entered into the CRFs with the source documents 
(eg,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] /clinic/phy sician’s office medical records ). The nature and location of all source 
documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the 
CRF are known to the s ponsor and study -site personnel and are accessible for verification by  [CONTACT_66886] -site contact. If electronic records are maintained at the study  site, the method of 
verification must be discusse d with the study -site personnel . 
Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of 
verify ing that the data recorded in the CRF are consistent with the original source data. Findings 
from this review of CRFs and source documents will be discusse d with the study -site personnel. 
The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be 
available, the source documentation will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be 
provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a 
regular basis dur ing the study to provide feedback on the study conduct.
In addition, to on- site monitoring visits, remote contact [CONTACT_334311]. It is expected that during these 
remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of 
the study  at the site.
Central monitoring will take place for data identified by  [CONTACT_70467].
17.9. Study Completion/Termination
17.9.1. Study Completion
The study  is considered completed with the last visit for the last subject participating in the 
study . The final data from the study  site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after completion 
of the final subject visit at that study  site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial 
Agreement.
17.9.2. Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study  at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A

Discontinuation of further drug development
17.10. On-Site A udits
Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality  assurance department may visit the study  site at 
any time during or after completi on of the study  to conduct an audit of the study  in compliance 
with regulatory  guidelines and company  policy . These audits will require access to all study 
records, including source documents, for inspection and comparison with the CRFs. Subject 
privacy  must, however, be respec ted. The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible 
for being present and available for consultation during routinely  scheduled study -site audit visits 
conducted b y the sponsor or its designees. 
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_23865], either as 
part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study  in support of a 
regulatory  submission. The investigator should immediately  notify  the sponsor if he or she has 
been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y a regulatory agency  concerning an upcoming inspection .

Measurability  of tumor at baseline
Definitions
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non -measurable as follows:
Measurable:
Tumor lesions:   Must be accuratel y measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of 
measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
 [ADDRESS_412924] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with 
calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)
 [ADDRESS_412925] X -ray 
Non-measurable:
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 
10 to <15mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-
measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identi fied 
by [CONTACT_87415].
Specifications by [CONTACT_334350] -up. Imaging based evaluation should always be done 
rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable 
by [CONTACT_461]. 
Clinical lesions:   Clinical lesions will only be considered meas urable when they are superficial and 
10mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As 
noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_51752], imaging evaluation 
should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study. 
Chest X-ray:  Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an important 
endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions 
on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clear ly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. 
See Appendix II for more details. 
CT, MRI:   CT  is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the 
assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_412926] 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice

Approved, 9 January 2018thickness. MRI is also acceptab le in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). More details concerning the 
use of both CT and MRI for assessment of objective tumor response evaluation are provided in 
Appendix II. 
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of 
measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a 
later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and 
measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_129579], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about radiation 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instanc es. 
Endoscopy, laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are 
obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurr ence following complete response or surgical 
resection is an endpoint. 
Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete response (CR). 
Cytology, histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if 
required by [CONTACT_990] (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known 
residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be a potential adverse effect of 
treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of 
the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if the 
measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response 
(or stable disease) and progressive disease.
Tumor response evaluation
Assessment of overall tumor burden and measurable disease
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at 
baseline and use this as a com parator for subsequent measurements. Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_46918] a t least one measurable lesion 
Baseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non -target’ lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions 
total (and a m axim um of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified 
as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements . It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to 
reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured 
reproducibly, should be selected. 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions,) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters . The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
character ize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions shou ld be followed as ‘present’, 
‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression. In addition, it is possible to record multiple nontarget

lymph nodes ’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’). 
Response criteria
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumour response for target 
lesions.
Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target le sions. 
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease:   At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to 
the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). 
Stable Disease (SD):   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
progressive disease, tak ing as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
Evaluation of non -target lesions
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
level. 
Non-CR/Non -progressive disease:   Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
Progressive Disease:   Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note :  the appearance of 
one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
Evaluation of best overall response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the end 
of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation. On occasion a response may not be 
documented unt il after the end of therapy so protocols should be clear if post -treatment assessments are to 
be considered in determination of best overall response. The patient’s best overall response assignment 
will depend on the findings of both target and non-target disease and will also take into consideration the 
appearance of new lesions. 
Timepoint response
It is assumed that at each protocol specified timepoint, a response assessment occurs. Table [ADDRESS_412928] non- measurable (therefore non -target) disease only, Table [ADDRESS_412929] overall response:  all timepoints
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient is known. 
Best response determination in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS NOT 
required: Best response in these trials is defined as the best response across all timepoints (for example, a 
patient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and progressive disease on last
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
YONDELIS(trabectedin)
Clinical Protocol ET743 -OVC -3006 – Amendment [ADDRESS_412930] overall response of PR). When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet 
the protocol specified minimum time from baseline. If the minimum time is not met when SD is 
otherwise the best timepoint response, the patient’s bes t response depends on the subsequent assessments. 
For example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, progressive disease at second and does not meet 
minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of progressive disease. The same patient lost to 
follow-up after the first SD assessment would be considered inevaluable.

aNon-CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non-target disease since SD is 
increasingly used as endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category 
when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ‘symptomatic deteri oration’. 
Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response:  it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_334302]. The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_334351]-target disease as shown in Tables 1 –2.
Conditions that define ‘early progression, early death and inevaluability’ are study specific and should be 
clearly described in each protocol (d epending on treatment duration, treatment periodicity). 
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the 
evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual 
lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before assigning a status of complete response. 
FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a 
residual radiographic abnormality is thought to rep resent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this 
circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_334352]. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/ sensitivity. 
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g. very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or 
necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at the next 
scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the earlier date when 
progression was suspected.

(whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study). 
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease 
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomized trials, from date of 
randomization) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study
(ifthe baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of progressive disease). 
The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease varies in different studies and diseases. If the 
proportion of patients achieving stable disease for a minimum period of time is an endpoint of importance 
in a particular trial, the protocol should specify the minimal time interval required between two 
measurements for determination of stable disease.

Clinical Protocol ET743 -OVC -3006 – Amendment [ADDRESS_412937] 1.1 Rationale
Response criteria 
non-target disease‘uneq uivocal 
progression’ 
considered as PDMore detailed description of 
‘unequivocal progression’ to 
indicate that it should not 
norm ally trump target disease 
status. It must be 
representative of overall 
disease status change, not a 
single lesion increaseConfu sion with RECIST 1.0 
where some were considering 
PD if ‘increase’ in any non -
target lesion, even when target 
disease is stable or responding.
New  lesions New  section on Ne w lesions To provide guidance on when a 
lesion is considered new (and 
thus PD).
Overall response Table integrated target 
and non -target lesionsTwo tables:  one integrating 
target and non -target and the 
other of non -target only  To account for the fact that 
RECIST criteria are now  being 
used in trials where PFS is the 
endpoint and no t all patients 
have measurable (target) 
disease at baseline.
Special notes:
How  to assess and measure 
lymph nodes;
CR in face of residual tissue;
Discussion of ‘equivocal’ 
progressionFrequently asked questions on 
these topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].
Confirmatory measure ForCR and PR:  
criteria must be met 
again 4 weeks after 
initial documentationRetain this requirement 
ONLY for non -randomised 
trials with primary endpoint 
of responseData w arehouse shows that 
response rates rise when 
confirmation is eliminated, but 
the only circumstance where 
this is important is in trials 
where there is no concurrent 
comparative control and where 
this measure is the primary 
endpoint.
Progression -free 
survivalGeneral comments 
onlyMore specific comments on 
use of PFS (or proportion 
progres sion-free) as phase II 
endpoint. 
Greater detail on PFS 
assessment in phase III trialsIncreasing use of PFS in phase 
III trials requires guidance on 
assessment of PD in patients 
with non -measurable disease
Reporting of response 
results9 categories sugge sted 
for reporting phase II 
resultsDivided into phase II and 
phase III;  
9 categories collapsed into 5;
In phase III, guidance given 
about reporting responseSimplifies reporting and 
clarifies how to report phase II 
and III data consistently. 
Response in phase III 
trialsMore relaxed 
guidelines possible if 
protocol specifiedThis section removed and 
referenced in section above:  
no need to have different 
criteria for phase II and IIISimplification of response 
assessment by [CONTACT_334353] ‘rules’ unnecessary.

Approved, 9 January 2018Attachment 7:Study Procedures as Outlined in A mendment [ADDRESS_412939], study data up to 20 September 2017 were evaluated 
for safety and OS (45% rather than 60% of the required death events at the planned interim analysis). 
Following the review of the study data by [CONTACT_334305] 15 December 2017, the HR for OS was 0.962, 
crossing the previously agreed upon threshold for futility of 0.93. In view of this result and the observed 
and expected higher toxicity in Arm A as compared with Arm B, the IDMC recommended discontinuing 
the study.
Subjects Assigned to Treatment Arm A and Treatment Arm B
As of Amendment 6, treatment with trabectedin should be immediately discontinued for subjects assigned 
to Arm A (trabectedin+DOXIL). All study subjects (Arm A or Arm B) currently on study who, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , are deriving clinical benefit may continue treatment with single -agent DOXIL 
as per the local standard of care. Treatment for these subjects may continue as long as the subjects comply 
with protocol -specified prohibitions and restrictions for treatment (Section 4.3) and as long as they 
experience clinical benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] . DOXIL will be provided by [CONTACT_37738]&D as needed 
until post -trial access to DOXIL is available or until disease progression , whichever occurs first.
Accordingly, the end of study data collection is defined as when all subjects on study treatment have 
completed treatment termination visit assessments as specified in the Time and Events Schedule for 
Amendment 6or by [ADDRESS_412940] of care, only serious adverse event s should bereported to 
JR&D as outlined in S ection 12.3.2.
Subjects in Screening
No new subjects will be screened. Subjects currently in screening are be eligible to receive treatment with 
single-agent DOXIL, if the investigator confirms that such treatment would be a clinically appropriate 
therapeutic option. These subjects will not be randomized to a treatment group , but must meet study
inclusion and exclusion criteria (per Amendment 6, Sect ions 4.1and 4.2). As indicated above, for subjects 
in treatment Arms A and B who continue on single -agent DOXIL, subjects in screening who receive 
single -agent DOXIL will be allowed to continue treatment as long as the subjects comply with protocol -
specified prohibitions and restrictions for treatment (Section 4.3) and who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], are exper iencing clinical benefit. DOXIL will be provided by [CONTACT_37738]&D as needed until post-
trial access to DOXIL is a vailable or until disease progression , whichever occurs first.
Data Collection 
Following Amendment 6, study data collection will cease when all subjects on study treatment have 
completed the treatment termination visit assessments as specified in the Time and Events Schedule for 
Amendment [ADDRESS_412941] ion for adverse events or 
abnormal findings willbe moni tored until the study clinical cutoff date (18 January 2018).
For subjects continuing treatment with single -agent DOXIL, as per the local standard of care, only serious 
adverse event s should be reported to JR&D as outlined in Section 12.3.2 .

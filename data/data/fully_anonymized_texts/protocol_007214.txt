[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  [ADDRESS_355496]   6 
Background. In preclinical models , benfotiamine efficiently ameliorates the clinical and 7 
biological pathologies that define Alzheimer’s disease (AD) including impaired cognition, beta 8 
amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, diminished glucose metabolism, oxidative stress, 9 
increased advanced glycation end products (AGE) and inflammation.   [ADDRESS_355497] preliminary data on feasibility, safety and efficacy in individuals  with 11 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or mild dementia due to AD  in a placebo -controlled 12 
trial of benfotiamine.  13 
Methods. A twelve-mo nth treatment with benfotiamine tested whether clinical decline would be 14 
delay ed in the benfotiamine group compared to the placebo group. The primary clinical outcome 15 
was the AD -Assessment -Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS -Cog). S econdary outcomes were 16 
the clinic al dementia rating (CDR) score and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake , measured with 17 
brain pos itron emission tomography (PET). Blood AGE  were examined as an exploratory 18 
outcome.   19 
Results. Participants were treated with benfotiamine (34) or placebo (36). Benfotiamine 20 
treatment was safe. The increase in ADAS -cog was 43% lower in the benfotiamine group than in [ADDRESS_355498] was  nearly statistically 22 
significant (p=0.125). Worsening in CDR was 77% lower (p=0.034) in the benfotiamine group [ADDRESS_355499] was stronger in the APOE ε4  non-carriers . 24 
Benfotiamine significantly reduced increases in AGE (p=0.044), and this effect was stronger in [ADDRESS_355500] at one year (p=0 .002).  27

INTRODUCTION  31 
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_291268]- β (Aβ) have in most cases 32 
shown a lack of efficacy , suggesting that AD treatment development should consider alternative 33 
targets.  In addition to plaques, tangles and cognitive decline, multiple changes accompany AD 34 
including inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic dysregulation . Cerebral g lucose 35 
metabo lism as measured by [CONTACT_291284] -18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose positron- emission tomography 36 
(FDGPET ) changes decades before AD is typi[INVESTIGATOR_291269] [1], and in AD patients reductions 37 
in glucose utili zation  correlate highly with cognitive decline [2].  38 
 Abnormalities in glucose m etabolism , vascular changes  and inflammation ar e closely 39 
linked  and common feature s of AD [3, 4]. T hiamine diphosphate (ThDP )- dependent enzymes 40 
regulate key steps in brain glucose metabolism, and the activities of ThDP -dependent enzymes 41 
decline in blood and brain of AD patients . The reduction in the activity of these enzymes provide 42 
a plausible underly ing mechanism for the metabolic abnormalities [5-7]. In pre -clinical model s, 43 
thiamine deficiency induces inflammation and change in vasculature [8]. Abnormal metabolism 44 
often leads to over production of free radica ls that damage other molecules.  At autopsy, 45 
oxidative stress in the brain is as widespread as plaques and tangles [9]. Increases in Advanced 46 
Glycation End products (AGE), toxic protein modifications that are indicative of altered glucose 47 
metabolism, and their receptor , RAGE , occur in the brain [10] and periphery [11] of AD patients , 48 
in both plaques and tangles [12].  [ADDRESS_355501] actions on multiple metabolic 50 
enzymes and pathways, inflammation and oxidative stress [13, 14]. Benfotiamine’s activation of 51 
the enzyme transketolase [15] accelerates the shunting of the precursors of AGE towards the [ADDRESS_355502] thereby r educing the production of AGE  [16, 17]. The reduction in 53 
AGE decreases metabolic stress , which reduces  vascular complications  [18-21]. By [CONTACT_291285] [ADDRESS_355503]  thiamine administration , 55 
benfotiamine may overcome the reduction in activity of ThDP dependent enzymes in AD [18, 56 
19]. For example,  mice [22] and humans  [23] that have genetic defects in the thiamine 57 
transporter can be treated with high dose benfotiamine . Benfotiamine is  an antioxidant   [24-26], 58 
modulates arachidonic acid inflammation  pathways , nuclear transcription Factor κB (NF -κβ), 59 
protein kinase B, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and vascular endothelial growth 60 
factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling pathways  [14]. Recent studies suggest that restoring 61 
cerebral perfusion by [CONTACT_291286] a nother strategy for improving 62 
cognition in A D participants  [27]. Benfotiamine prevents lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- induced 63 
macrophage death and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [28]. Multiple approaches suggest 64 
that b enfotiamine inhibits inflammatory mediators and enhances anti -inflammatory factor 65 
production in activated microglia [28, 29].  [ADDRESS_355504] human gene mutations that cause AD [25]. In a transgenic 68 
mouse model of tauopathy, benfotiamine treatment  diminishes tangles,  activates the Nrf2/ARE [ADDRESS_355505] , neuroprotective  and improves behavioral deficits  [30]. In animal models of amyloid 70 
plaque formation, b enfotiamine reduces amyloid plaque numbers  and phosphorylated tau levels , 71 
elevates the phosphorylation  of glycogen synthase kinase -3α and -3β, and improves memory 72 
 
5 
 [31]. In other animal models, benfotiamine modulates activation of [COMPANY_004]3 -β [32], restores 73 
neurogenesis [26, 33], modulate s AMPA receptor expression [25] and decreases oxidative stress  74 
[26]. Together, t hese results suggest that benfotiamine may be therapeutically beneficial  for AD .  75 
 Benfotiamine also diminishes AGE. Measures of AGE in the serum assess peripheral 76 
abnormalities and may mirror CNS abnormalities in glucose homeostasis.  AGE  are a biomarker 77 
implicated in aging and the development, or worsening  of many degenerative diseases, such as 78 
diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic renal disease, and AD. H igh concentrations of AGE a ppear 79 
predictive of long- term decline in cognition -related daily living performance in patients with AD 80 
as measured by [CONTACT_291287] (CDR) [11] or Mini Mental Status Exam  (MMSE) [34]. 81 
Thus, AGE may be a promising therapeutic target to prevent or delay the progression of AD  82 
[35]. Numerous studies in patients with diabetes show that benfotiamine diminishes AGE [21]. A  83 
preliminary study of five patients without placebo control that was published after our trial was 84 
initiated  showed promise [36]. 85 
 Benfotiamine is safe compound in AD patients  as demonstrated in trials conducted for 86 
the treatment of peripheral neuropathy in diabetes [13, 20, 37]. The dosage studied m ost 87 
extensively in diabetics is  300 mg in the morning and night , but dosages as high as 900 mg per 88 
day show no significant toxicity [20].  [ADDRESS_355506] whether benfotiamine treatment could delay clinical 92 
decline in amyloid positive patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI)  or mild 93 
dementia due to AD with MMSE  scores of >21. ADAS -cog served as the primary endpoint. [ADDRESS_355507] [1, 2]. AGE levels were  used as a 98 
peripheral marker of efficacy. Measures of thiamine and its esters thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)  99 
and thiamine monophosphate (ThMP) provide d blood markers of efficacy of drug delivery.  100

MATERIALS AND METHODS  102 
 This clinical trial was a collaborative study between investigators at the Burke 103 
Rehabilitation Center including the Burke Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_291270] 104 
Institute [ an affiliate of Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM)] , WCM , and investigators  at Columbia 105 
University Irving Medical Center  (CUMC). The trial was approved by [CONTACT_291288]  106 
Boards of the Burke Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], WCM and CUMC. 107 
 Patient population . 108 
  Seventy amyloid positive p atients 60 years and older with a MCI  (21< MMSE < 26) or 109 
mild AD dementia (MMSE≥26)  were included . Table 1 shows t he inclusion and ex clusion 110 
criteria for what we define as AD in this trial .  These criteria are especially important because 111 
new imaging capabilities will likely redefine AD [38].  [ADDRESS_355508] found 115 
ADAS -Cog change scores differed by 3-4 points between placebo and treatment groups over a 6- 116 
month time period . Moreover, other studies report annual changes in the ADAS -Cog a mong 117 
those who are untreated to average 9.6 points (SD=8.2) [39, 40]. Power was calculated based on [ADDRESS_355509] deviation of 4, 120

between treatment  and placebo.  122 
 Assignment of patients. A randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blinded trial of 123 
benfotiamine in persons with aMCI or AD dementia with a duration of 12 months  was 124 
conducted. Using blocked, stratified  randomization design, patients  were  assign ed to the 125

Study procedures.  139 
 The trial was  registered in  ClinicalTrials.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] (Figure 1). Participants 140 
were pre -screened from the database of the Memory Evaluation Treatment Service (METS) at 141 
Burke Rehabilitation Center or referrals from the Center for the Aging Brain (CAB) at 142 
Montefiore/Einstein Medical College, Alzheimer’s Association, prim ary care physicians, and 143 
private neurologists from the lower Hudson Valley region. aMCI  or mild AD dementia were 144 
diagnosed according to NIA -AA workgroups criteria [41, 42]. Patients  who met the inclusion 145 
criteria for aMCI or m ild dementia due to AD  were invited for a screening initial visit at the 146 
Memory Evaluation and Therapeutic Service ( METS ) outpatient department at the Burke 147 
Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. After informed consent was obtained from patient s and their h ealth care 148 
proxies,  a physical examination including EKG, laboratory tests (C omplete Blood C ount, 149 
Complete Metabolic Panel , Vitamin B12, folate, Thyroid function tests ), a neurological exam  150 
and the MMSE were administered. If eligible (Table 1) , participants  were referred to 151 
Westchester Imaging Center for an Amyloid PET/CT scan of the brain. Only participants  with a 152 
positive amyloid scan were sent to CUIMC for a baseline F -18-FDG PET/CT scan of the brain. 153 
At the baseline visit, the cognitive tests were performed and blood drawn for measurement of 154 
thiamine, ThDP and ThMP by [CONTACT_5004] [43] and APOE genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Enrolled patients returned to 155 
the Burke outpatient clinic at month 3, 6, 9 and 12 for subsequent visits. At month 12 the final 156 
FDG/PET scan was performed at CUIMC. 157 
 The trial duration per participant was twelve months . Participants in the treatment group  158 
took one 300 mg capsule of benfotiamine in the morning and one in the evening. The 159 
 
9 
 participants in the placebo group took one 300 mg capsule in the morning and evening with 160 
microcrystalline cellulose without benfotiamine. At each visit, the patients retur ned the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] 161

The trial duration per participant was twelve months . Participants in the treatment group 178 
took one 300 mg capsule of benfotiamine in the morning and one in the evening. The 179 
participants in the placebo group took one 300 mg capsule in the morning and evening with 180

bottles for that period. The number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_291271] (the percent 182 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_291272]). The benfotiamine and placebo were manufactured and provided by [CONTACT_941] 183 
Advanced Orthomolecular Research, Canada. They prepared the b enfotiamine according to an 184 
FDA -approved IND, which was prepared by [CONTACT_291291], and 185 
issued to the Burke Neurological Institute.  186 
Cognitive measures .  187 
The following cognitive tests were conducted  at the intervals indicated in F igure 1 :  188 
• AD Assessment Scale -Cognitive Subscale (ADAS -Cog) was the primary outcome [ADDRESS_355512] important symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. 190 
It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention 191 
and other cognitive abilities  [45] [46].  192 
• Clinical dementia rating (CDR) score. CDR is a 5 -point scale used to characterize six 193 
domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to Alzheimer disease and 194 
related dementias: Memory, Orientation, Judgment & Problem Solving, Community 195 
Affairs, Home & Hobbies, and Personal Care . A higher score indicates greater dementia 196 
[47]. 197 
• The Buschke Selective Reminding Test (SRT)  [48] is a standard diagnostic tool in the [ADDRESS_355513] to its predictive value for dementia 199 
[49, 50].  200 
• Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_291277] a wide range of behaviors 201 
encountered in dementia patients to provide a means of distinguishing frequen cy and 202 
 
11 
 severity of behavioral changes. Ten behavioral and two neuro -vegetative domains are 203 
evaluated through an interview with the caregiver [51-53].  204 
• Alzheimer’s Disease Co operative Stu dy- Activities of  Daily Living (ADCS -ADL). 205 
The ADCS -ADLSIV is a caregiver -based ADL scale composed of 19 items developed 206 
for use in dementia clinical studies [54]. It assesses the patient's performance of both 207 
basic and instrumental acti vities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, 208 
communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting 209 
hobbies and interests, as well as making judgments and decisions. Higher numbered 210 
scores and answers of " yes" reflect a more self -sufficient individual. Therefore, the 211 
higher total score  correlates with higher cognitive function. The total score is the sum of 212 
all items and sub -questions [55]. [ADDRESS_355514]  217

was acquired in four contiguous 5-minute  frames . Frames were aligned  with SPM 12, averaged, 230 
and then spatially normalized to the MNI template using SPM12 231

Anatomic Labeling (AAL) Atlas [56] were computed . A subset of [ADDRESS_355519] (ROIs) were chosen for the group analysis due to their relev ance to AD  235 
including : posterior cingulate, precuneus, frontal, inferior parietal, mid temporal, hippocampus, 236 
paracentral lobule, and cerebellum . The paracentral lobule and cerebellum were included as 237 
reference regions given their relative preservation duri ng AD progression. 238 
 Derivation of spatial covariance patterns for Glucose FDGPET.  239 
 A multivariate machine learning approach was also applied to evaluate the FDG PET 240 
data (Figure 10). Pattern -based methods have been increasingly applied to  the evaluation of 241 
neurodegeneration and therapeutic response  as they address the issue of complexity in comparing 242 
multiple regions and can increase signal to noise for analysis . Feature reduction was performed 243 
through use of the Scaled Subprofile Model (S SM) [57-61], a form of Principal Components 244 
 
13 
 Analysis (PCA). The r esulting components were used in regression modeling that determined 245 
spatial patterns of hypometabolism and hypermetabolism (or preservation relative to other 246 
regions) associated with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score.  [ADDRESS_355520]  score in a negative direction ( i.e. the higher the pattern score, the lower the CDR ). The [ADDRESS_355521]-fitting set of Principal Component s was ob tained via the Akaike criterion [62], and came out 251 
as PC1 -2. 252 
To help with the imputation  of the multivariate analysis, a generic multivariate 253 
decomposition was written as: Y(s, x) = w(s) v(x) + ε (s,x), where Y denotes the (log - 254 
transformed) data which depends on a participant and time index s  and the voxel location x. The 255 
pattern score w(s) is a scalar that solely depends  on subject and time, but not voxel location, 256 
whereas the derived pattern v( x) depends  on voxel location, but shows invariance across 257 
participants and time, i.e. does not depend on index s; ε(s,x) denotes residual signal that is 258 
dependent on participant, time and voxel location, but which was  discarded for our purposes. 259 
The pattern score w(s) was chosen to correlate negatively with CDR across the data. The pattern 260 
v(x) is normalized to have unity Euclidean norm, i.e. || v||=1. This means that the pattern score 261 
carries a ll information about the strength of the signal associated with the spatial pattern. Higher 262 
values of w(s) imply higher values of pattern-associated FDGPET signal in direct proportion in [ADDRESS_355522], a bootstrap resampling 265 
procedure [63, 64] was performed 10,[ADDRESS_355523] if the 95% coverage 268 
interval (= [2.5%, 97.5%]) did not overlap with, and lay to one side of, zero. For the correct 269 
interpretation, it is important to keep in mind that positive and negative loadings describe only 270 
relative, and not absolute  differences, in the signal associated with any covariance pattern. Since 271 
the residual signal in ε(s,x) was stripped off, there cannot be assur ance that there are absolute [ADDRESS_355524] of treatment at baseline and follow -up, also broken down by [CONTACT_291292] 275

  Our primary a nalysis followed Intention-to -Treat ( ITT) and the secondary analysis was [ADDRESS_355526]. For the other measures only per-protocol 285 
analy sis are presented.   286 
 
15 
   Spearman correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between continuous 287 
variables. Student’s t -test was used to compare the continuous variables between placebo and 288 
treatment groups ; Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables betw een placebo 289 
and t reatment groups . Specifically, t wo-sample Student’s t -test was used to compare the score 290 
changes (ADAS score, normalized PET -related scores, etc.) from baseline between Placebo and [ADDRESS_355527] 294 
(LOCF) method was used to i mpute the missing values  of ADAS total score and the secondary [ADDRESS_355528] a s well for each time point. The primary analysis was done on ITT data 296 
which were imputed with LOCF method . Per-protocol analysis was done as a sensitivity analysis 297 
and as observational comparisons  [66]. 298 
 In the time to event analysis,  time to  ≥ 3 points of ADAS change was calculated based on 299 
whether the ADAS score changed from baseline  ≥3 (event) at each time point. When no change 300 
≥[ADDRESS_355529] follow -up time 301 
(12 month) was used to calculate the duration . Kaplan -Meier estimator was then used to estimate [ADDRESS_355530] for 303 
statistical significance.  304 
 As sensitivity analyses, repeated -measure ANOVA, generalized estimating equation 305 
(GEE ) and Mixed effect model and Wilcoxon Rank-s um test were also perfor med on primary 306 
endpoints with and without imputation to compare differences between placebo and t reatment 307 
groups .  308 
 
16 
  Subgroup analyses in MMSE, APOE and s ex were either in the per -protocol analysis or 309 
exploratory. A Student’s t -test was used in each of the subgroup comparisons. An ANCOVA was 310 
also used to analyze the treatment difference while adjusting for each of these covariates. 311 
Interaction between MMSE and ADAS-cog responses was assessed by [CONTACT_291293] 312 
interaction term.  Mult iple comparisons were  present in our analyses with secondary endpoints, 313 
subgroup analyses, or analyses with multiple PET- related scores. Due to exploratory nature of 314 
those analyses and early trial of this study, we d id not apply correction of p -values for multiple 315 
comparisons.  All statistical tests were two -sided with an alpha level of 0.05 as the significance 316 
cutoff. All analyses were performed in statistical software SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, 317 
NC). [ADDRESS_355531] participant  entered the trial on  February 12, 2015 and the final participant  322 
finished July 9, 2019. This allowed us to exceed our enrollment goal of 58. Pre -screening of 634 323 
patients at the M ETS at the Burke Reh abilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_291278] 120 participants  324 
(Figure 1). Only eighty -three  of these patients were amyloid positive. Twelve declined to 325 
participate. Seventy -one of these participants agreed to be part of the trial , and were randomized 326 
to receive either placebo  or benfotiamine. Eight subjects were prematurely discontinued from the 327 
trial prior to Month 12.   Three participants were withdrawn due to non- compliance <80%; three 328 
withdrew consent due to unwillingness to complete study procedures; one participant was lost to [ADDRESS_355532] a n HbA1c < 8% trial and/or a fasting glucose < 200 mg/dl to be enrolled in the trial. [ADDRESS_355533] 12 month scores. Aft er the trial completion and after  the data were locked, one pat ient in 335 
the placebo group was determined to be on benfotiamine from another source and was excluded 336 
from the  per-protocol analysis. Thus, 37 (placebo) and 34 (benfotiamine) were included in the 337 
ITT analysis , and 36 (placebo) and 34 (benfotiamine) were incl uded in the per-protocol analysis .  338 
 Whether the patient took the required medication was referred to as compliance. If the 339 
patients who withdrew are included, the percent compliance in the placebo group was 87.7 340 
(3.5)% and in the treatment group was 89.8 (3%). If the patients that withdrew are not included, 341 
the percent compliance in the placebo group was 94.1 (1.3)% and in the treatment groups percent 342 
compliance was 94.8 (1.4)% . 343 
 The demographic characteristics of the patients are described in Table 2 . The 344 
randomization procedure was based on the order of patient entry into the study. There were no 345 
statistically significant differences in age, race , MMSE,  and demographic  or clinical 346 
characteristics. The goal to recruit patients with an average MMSE of 26 was met. The 347 
percentage of fe males in the benfotiamine group (67.6%) was higher t han in the placebo group 348 
(50%). Although the distribution by [CONTACT_291294], only 2.9% of the population was  Non - 349 
Hispanic Black . The distribution of APO E ε4 carriers and non- carriers (60% and 40%, 350 
respectively) in the whole population was reflected in the benfotiamine ( 64.7 and 35.3%, 351 
 
18 
 respectively) and placebo (55.6% and 44.4%, respectively) groups. Nearly identical proportions 352 
were also observed for males (58.6% and 41.4%) and females (61% and 39%). The scores on the 353 
neuropsychological tests at baseline did not differ between the two groups, with the exception of 354 
NPI, which differed between groups at baseline (p=0.040) (Table 2B).  355 
 Baseline thiamine and ThMP , but not ThDP distributions were similar in the two groups. 356 
Blood thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) was lower (p=0.038) in the benfotiamine group (Table 2C ). 357 
In agreement with the literature [67], ThDP was lower in females than males (p=0.0003). At 358 
baseline, ThDP did not correlate with  MMSE (p=0.644), CDR (p=0.618), ADAS -cog (p=0.883) 359 
or whole brain glucose utilization  (p=0.644).  360 
 Baseline FDGPET measures are presented in Table 2D . In agreement with prior findings 361 
FDG PET in  whole brain at baseline correlated with the M MSE (Spearman correlation , r=0.288, 362 
p=0.015). Brain glucose utilization was  4.4% higher in females  than males (p=0.003). At 363 
baseline, FDG PET in the mid -temporal region was significantly higher in the benfotiamine 364 
treatment group than placebo group (p=0.020), and the cingulate was higher in the treatment 365 
group at trend level  (p=0.069) (Table 2D ). 366 
  Safety profile. No adverse events related to the 2 X 300 mg benfotiamine per day were 367 
observed and patients did not complain about the medication  (Table 3A ).  368 
 Benfotiamine and ADAS -Cog changes (Figure 2 , Table 3B). A comparison of [ADDRESS_355534] model 371 
(p=0.071), GEE (p=0.137), and a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test (p=0.098)  (Figure 2, 372 
 
19 
 Table 3B ). At 12 months, the change in the placebo group was 3.26 whereas in the benfotiamine 373 
group the change was 1.39. This difference was not apparent at 3, 6 or 9 months. The  per- 374 
protocol analysis (Table 3B ) suggested that the differences were significant when analyzed by a [ADDRESS_355535] model (p=0.035), GEE (p=0.0 69) or Wilcoxon Rank-Sum (p=  0.049). The sub- 376 
category exploratory analysis of ADAS -cog revealed that the changes fr om baseline in the 377 
commands component (p=0.001) and the word finding difficulty (p=0.033) were significant at [ADDRESS_355536] modification by [CONTACT_291292] ε4 allele carrier status . 382 
Finally, no significant correlation occurred between blood thiamine, ThDP  or ThMP values  and 383 
ADAS -cog. No significant interaction was found between MMSE score and ADAS -cog 384 
response (p=0.122), but a post-hoc analysis suggested that benfotiamine had a stronger 385 
response among those with a higher MMSE at baseline ( MMSE >= 26 difference in change  386 
ADAS-cog was significant ( p=0.027) whereas this was not the case for MMSE<26 (p = 0.99).  [ADDRESS_355537] from baseline to 12 months was significantly 388 
different  between placebo and benfotiamine groups (p=0.034), favoring the benfotiamine group 389 
(Figure 3). The difference in the placebo group was 0.22 whereas the change in the benfotiamine 390 
group was 0.05, corresponding to a reduction of deterioration by 77%. The mean change in [ADDRESS_355538] -SB f rom baseline to 12 months showed a difference at trend level  between placebo and 392 
benfotiamine groups (p=0.078). In an analysis of individual CDR subscores, the “home and 393 
hobbies score” differed between groups (p=0.032) whereas other subscores did not diffe r.  394 
 
20 
  APOE ε4 status (Figure 3C), but not sex (Figure 3B), was associated with a differen tial 395 
response to benfotiamine. The performance of males and females was  not significantly different  396 
(Figure 3B). The change from baseline in females 0.219 was nearly  identical to that in males . 397 
However, the non- APOE ε4  group seemed to respond much more  than those with the ε4 allele 398 
(Figure 3C). Indeed, the change from baseline was significant in the non- APOE ε4  group 399 
(p=0.013) although only eleven participants were in this category . No significant  interaction was 400 
found by [CONTACT_291295] >=26 vs <26 (p=0.878) .  401 
 The Buschke SRT  (Figure 4) . No s ignificant change in the SRT (p=0.177) nor the 402 
change in score (0.315) (Figure 4) occurred. Placebo treated participants showed a downward [ADDRESS_355539] responsive at 6 mo nths (compared base line p=0.028) and 12 months 405 
(compared to baseline p=0.066).  406 
 NPI (Figure 5) . No differences in change in NPI [INVESTIGATOR_291279] 407 
treatment when the whole population was analyzed (Figure 5A ). However, benfotiamine was 408 
associated with significantly reduced scores in males at month 9 (0.014) and month 12 (p=0.035) 409 
(Figure 5B). The effects of benfotiamine were not altered by [CONTACT_291292]4 status (Figure 5C).  410 
 ADCS -ADL  (Figure 6) .  No significant differences were observed in ADCS -ADL . In the [ADDRESS_355540] 412 
of benfotiamine (Figure 6).  413 
 Response of thiamine , ThDP and ThMP  to benfotiamine treatment (Table 3C ; 414 
Figures  7 and 8). 415 
 
21 
  The 161 fold increase in in blood thiamine indicated the administration of the drug was 416 
successful . In the placebo group, s mall increases for the levels of thiamine (5.5 to 13.6; p= 417 
0.044) and ThDP  (74.5 to 91.7; p=0.044) occurred, but not  ThMP (3.4 to 4.0; p=0.382) (Table 418 
3C). A fter completion of the trial, it was discovered that one patient in the placebo gro up took 419 
commercial benfotiamine during the trial . Consequentially, data from the patient was excluded 420 
for all per-protocol analysis. The twelve- month treatment with benfotiamine significantly 421 
elevated blood thiamine from 6.2 to 999 ( 161 fold) above baseline, ThDP (two  fold)  and ThMP 422 
(five  fold) (Table 3C ). Altho ugh the differences were significant, the scatter grams  revealed large 423 
variation s (Figure 7). These changes were apparent even though the timing between the taking [ADDRESS_355541] capsule and taki ng blood were not standardized. The much larger changes than expected 425 
may be related to the duration of the treatment or the purity of the  benfotiamine.  426 
 There was a trend for APOE ε4 and sex related differences in thiamine response to 427 
benfotiamine  but the differences were not significant (Figure 8). Thiamine levels  after 428 
benfotiamine  were about two times higher in females  than males . Thiamine values were 429 
approximately 50% higher in APOE ε4 carriers  than non- APOE ε4  carriers .  430 
 The concentrations of blood thiamine, ThDP , ThMP after benfotiamine treatment did not 431 
correlate with ADAS -cog scores  (p=0.736, 0.917, 0.500, respectively) nor CDR (p= 0.762, 0.896, 432 
0.767, respectively ).  433 
 The response of advanced glycation end products (AGE) to benfotiamine treatment. [ADDRESS_355542] was 435 
more apparent in non- APOE ε4  patients (Figure 9).  [ADDRESS_355543] (p=0.002) (Figure 10B) across all participants and time points. Robust 442 
positive loadings , i.e. with more than 97.5% of bootstrap loadings larger than zero, were found in 443 
the right precuneus, inferior parietal and mid frontal cortex: higher relative signal in these areas 444 
was associated with a better (=lower) CDR score. Robust negative loadings , i.e. with more than 445 
97.5% of bootstrap loadings smaller than zero, were found in the  bilateral paracentral lobules and 446 
bilateral cerebellum: higher relative signal at these locations was associated with a higher 447 
(=worse) CDR score. Pattern s cores showed a significantly higher change from baseline to 12 448 
months in treated than untreated par ticipants (Figure 10A). However, a difference was observed 449 
between placebo and treatment arm at baseline (T=2.1582, p=0.034) when APOE status was not [ADDRESS_355544] at 12 months in APOE ε4  negative population (p=0.019) but not in APOE ε4  454 
positive population (p=0.255) (Figure 10C). In the APOE positive population there was no 455 
difference between treatment groups at baseline (p=0.164); in the APOE negative population, 456 
pattern scores  were higher at trend level ( p=0.086) in the benfotiamine gr oup. 457 
 
23 
  For 59 participants who completed follow -up, the longitudinal change in pattern score 458 
(follow -up minus baseline) also correlated negatively with the accompanying change in CDR 459 
score (R= -0.446, p<0.001). No difference in longitudinal change was observ ed between treated 460 
and untreated participants (p=0.638). Additional analyses to adjust for any baseline differences 461 
and to explore other baseline heterogeneity effects or comparison patterns were deferred for 462 
subsequent evaluation.  463 
 464 
Discussion  465 
 The results  show that benfot iamine administration in patients  with aMCI and dementia 466 
due to AD is safe and successful in increasing peripheral thiamine levels. The trial provides 467 
preliminary evidence of efficacy of benfotiamine on cognitive and functional outcomes . In 468 
aggregate, our results provide proof of principle that justify testing the efficacy of benfotiamine 469 
in ameliorating cognitive and functional decline among participants  with aMCI and dementia due 470 
to AD in a trial with a larger sample size and s tudy duration. Measures of blood thiamine (a 471 
pharmacokinetic marker of drug delivery) , FDGPET patterning (a CNS biomarker of synaptic 472 
activity ) and serum AGE (a peripheral biomarker  of metabolic dysregulation)  provided further 473 
evidence of the effects of benfotiamine that could benefit cognition.   474 
   475 
 The results support benfotiamine’s effectiveness which was  reported in a preliminary 476 
study of five patients without placebo control that was published after our trial was initiated  [36]. 477 
That study found that 300 mg daily of commercial benfotiamine over 18  months improved 478 
 
24 
 MMSE by [CONTACT_291296] (i.e., MMSE of 12 -25) than our 479 
patient population  (MMSE>21). Levels of blood thiamine and thiamine esters were not [ADDRESS_355545] than predicted , but the variation was large. The large increase in 485 
thiamine with relatively small increases in  ThDP  (two fold) and ThMP (fivefold) was also  486 
reported following benfotiamine in mouse brain [30]. Appreciable differences in thiamine levels 487 
were observed by [CONTACT_4321] (two-fold) and APOE -epsilon4 carrier status  (three-fold) following [ADDRESS_355546] AD a t basel ine that was suggested by 490 
other trials  [67-70] was not evident in our patients. Unlike previous studies which included more 491 
severe patients [68, 70], blood ThDP did not correlate significantly with MMSE (0.664), CDR 492 
(0.618) or ADAS -cog (0.883) at baseline or following benfotiamine. Thus, the baseline studies 493 
are not supportive of a critical role of blood ThDP in AD. Our studies do support the finding that 494 
ThDP is lower in females than males [67, 70]. These results suggest that t hiamine, ThDP and [ADDRESS_355547] as the sole target outcome for the progression pattern, and the 505 
very small longitudinal changes that occur in FDG PET over 12 months in this mild population. 506 
Next steps include alternate apriori and data driven pattern -based analyses to further understand 507 
these relationships. As other potential considerations, the p ositive effects of 508 
benfotiamine/thiamine, including impro ved cognition, in neurodegeneration occur with minimal 509 
change in ThDP [33] [30, 31]. Thus, benfotiamine/thiamine could be acting at steps of glucose 510 
metabolism that do not change brain glucose uptake or by [CONTACT_291297]/benfotiamine’s 511 
actions not directly linked to metabolism. Thiamine also regulates activities of enzyme like 512 
malate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase [71]. Thiamine can act as an antioxidant 513 
[13] [19, 26, 72, 73] and may act directly in cholinergic transmission [74]. Thiamine serves as an 514 
allosteric regulator of many proteins [73]. Benfotiamine and thiamin may act as Nrf2 activators 515 
[30], which would help the brain deal with many oxidative insults. Finally, 516 
benfotiamine/thiamine could be acting on endothelial cells as has been demonstrated in st udies 517 
of diabetes [20, 21, 37].  [ADDRESS_355548] that AD patients 519 
without APOE ε4  were more responsive to benfot iamine in this study population. The 520 
diminished response  did not seem to be a difference in drug availabil ity since blood thiamine 521 
(+46%), and its esters were all higher in patients with APOE ε4 following benfotiamine (not 522 
statistically significant). Patients with APOE ε4  may have a more severe form of the disease [ADDRESS_355549] more  plaques and they occur earlier [75-77]. APOE ε4 carriers have  higher 524 
levels of  the glyoxal, fluorescent AGEs, Nε -carboxymethyllysine, and the receptor for AGE 525 
(sRAGE ) (p= 0.018) when compared to non-carriers  [78] .  526 
  The role of AGE in AD as a biomarker and progression of disease is not well developed. 527 
Recent studies demonstrate that the develop ment of AGE parallel s the development of the 528 
cognitive deficit [11]. The AGE pentosidine is an indicator of Alzheimer’s disease [79]. 529 
Methylglyoxal and glyoxal le vels in serum are higher in MCI patients.  Methylglyoxal in serum 530 
distinguishes MCI from controls but not from AD. Meanwhile, serum glyoxal levels differentiate 531 
MCI from control and AD groups [35]. The levels of carboxymethylysine in serum correlate 532 
negatively with the clinical cognitive as measured by [CONTACT_157513]  [34]. AGE increase in healthy 533 
APOE ε4  and this may provide a link between  APOE ε4  and AGE and our responses  [78]. Both 534 
sex and APOE status alter the A D serum metabolome [80]. In animals, even mild thiamine 535 
deficiency leads to increases in AGE [81]. Increased AGE are common in diabetes, which 536 
predisposes to the development of AD, and there are many intriguing overlaps between diabetes 537 
and AD [18]. Benfotiamine prevents the mi cro and macro vascular damage in diabetes related to 538 
AGE [20, 37, 82]. The mechanisms for the protection have been studied extensively [83].  539 
 Our study has several limitations. Our sample size, while appropriate for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] , 540 
was relatively small and of short duration , which particularly affected our subgroup analys es. 541 
Some significant findings in the secondary endpoints, subgroup analyses and multiple PET - 542 
related scores could be due to chance in the context of multiple comparisons without p-value 543 
correction.  However, we believe that this approach is appropriate in the setting of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  544 
and inform the proposal of a larger confirmatory clinical trial. It is also important to point out 545 
 
27 
 that the observed effects for primary and secondary outcomes were consistently in the direction 546 
of benefit for benfotiamine. Another potential limitation is our definition of AD. O ur study 547 
participants had aMCI and dementia that met the criterion for the Alzheimer’s continuum in 548 
the NIA/AA research framework [38], which we ascertained through amyloid positivity on [ADDRESS_355550] effective, and the results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_56096] 554 
encouraging, providing preliminary evidence of efficacy. Ou r next step is to propose a larger 555 
clinical trial appropriately powered to replicate our findings.  We believe that further studies 556 
would be very valuable to determine whether benfotiamine may be helpful in delaying onset or 557 
treating AD.  558

1.1 Study Objectives
Our long term goal is to understand the likely health effects of cigarette smokers switching to a 
Standardized Research E-Cig (SREC) and to assess the role of nicotine delivery on switching, 
acceptability and markers of health outcomes . The specific objective of this proposal is to recruit a 
cohort of 240 current exclusive daily cigarette smokers and to measure a comprehensive battery of 
health markers at baseline and at 3 and 6 weeks after attempting to switch completely to SRECs 
containing either zero or 58 mg/ml nicotine in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled design 
with the following three specific aims:
1.1.1 Aim 1:  To characterize the short-term effects of attempting to switch from traditional cigarette 
smoking to a Standardized Research E-Cig from baseline to 6 weeks using a comprehensive 
battery of measures (e.g. carcinogen biomarker (NNAL), pulmonary function testing, Holter EKG, 
exhaled CO, and cotinine, BP etc.). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Our hypothesis is that attempting to switch to a SREC will result in a reduction in 
markers of harms to health, as compared with the baseline (exclusive cigarette 
smoking) measures.
1.1.2 Aim 2:  To compare the effects of switching to a standardized research electronic cigarette 
(SREC) with pods containing 58 mg/ml nicotine liquid versus 0 mg/ml nicotine liquid on smoking 
behavior and changes in health markers at [ADDRESS_1159362]-switching.
[IP_ADDRESS] Our hypothesis is that nicotine-containing SRECs will facilitate switching from 
smoking more efficiently than zero nicotine SRECs and will result in a significantly 
greater improvement in markers of health risk, but will conversely result in higher 
ratings of dependence on the SREC (as compared to the zero nicotine SREC) at [ADDRESS_1159363]-switching (after controlling for baseline measures).
[IP_ADDRESS] We also hypothesize that the nicotine-containing SRECs, (as compared with the 
zero nicotine SRECs, after controlling for baseline) will result in a lower total score 
for the withdrawal items on the MNWS and lower mean scores on ratings of 
cigarette craving, during the first  week of the trial. 
1.1.3 Aim 3 : At the end of each participant’s [ADDRESS_1159364] use, how to purchase their own 
electronic cigarette and supplies if they wish to continue using one, and sources of assistance to 
quit smoking. They will then be asked to complete telephone and online survey four weeks later 
(10 weeks after switching). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Our hypothesis is that participants randomized to nicotine-containing SRECs (as 
compared with those randomized to zero nicotine liquid) will be more likely to 
continue to try to abstain from cigarettes and to continue to use an e-cig at week 
10 follow-up.
1.2 Primary Study Endpoints
The primary endpoint for the study is creatinine-corrected urinary NNAL concentration at 6 weeks (after 
switching). 
1.3 Secondary Study Endpoints
Secondary outcomes for the study include changes in pulmonary function (FEV-1), tobacco-related 
toxicant concentrations, such as exhaled CO, EKG markers (HRV, PVCS, ST elevations, WRS duration), STUDY00008948

Page 4 of 37 (V.04/27/2017)urine cotinine, and blood pressure at 6 weeks, controlling for baseline measures. In addition, nicotine 
withdrawal and cravings, measured on the MNWS, at 1 week controlling for baseline.  Finally, the 
average number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) and measures of dependence (e.g. FTND, PSECDI) 
will be analyzed. Outcomes at the 10 week telephone follow-up include the average number of 
cigarettes smoked per day in the week prior to the follow-up call, the number of days on which an e-cig 
was used in the previous 21 days, and the self-reported cigarette abstinence (zero cigarettes smoked in 
the prior week).
2.[ADDRESS_1159365] ten years, a new inhaled nicotine device, commonly referred to as an electronic cigarette 
(e-cig), has become increasingly popular around the world, particularly in the [LOCATION_002] where more 
than 79% of US adults are currently aware of the devices and 3.7% are using one on a regular basis.[ADDRESS_1159366] prevalent among current smokers (15.9%) and recent ex-smokers (22.0%) and 
is very uncommon among adult never cigarette smokers (0.4%).3-[ADDRESS_1159367] diversified, making it 
difficult for users and non-users alike to understand the devices and their potential harms or benefits. 
Though e-cigs are generally considered to be safer than traditional combustible cigarettes, the devices 
do deliver fine particles when the solvents (propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavors, additives, and 
nicotine) are aerosolized and adequate assessments of cardiovascular and pulmonary health outcomes 
related to e-cig use are lacking.6 Recently, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) developed a 
Standardized Research E-Cig (SREC) which is available in both medium (58 mg/ml) and placebo (zero 
mg/ml) nicotine liquid concentrations.  The availability of this new device offers researchers the 
possibility of testing the likely health effects on users who are attempting to switch from cigarette 
smoking to e-cigs.  
2.[ADDRESS_1159368] on other spi[INVESTIGATOR_834718] (FVC), forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second  FEV1), and ratios of these values (FEV1/FVC).[ADDRESS_1159369] examined changes in lung and cardiovascular function over a longer time in smokers 
attempting to quit smoking by [CONTACT_667187] e-cigs. For example, Cibella et al8 found that smokers who 
completely switched to e-cigs and quit smoking showed steady improvement in their FEV (25-75%) and 
improvement in respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], including the time period when many continued using their e-
cigs. This is consistent with the idea that smoking has a more severe adverse effect on lung function 
than e-cig use. Laboratory studies have also examined some acute cardiovascular effects of e-cig use 
and compared these with acute cigarette smoking. Farsalinos et al9 examined the immediate effects of 
electronic cigarette use on left ventricular (LV) function, compared to the well-documented acute STUDY00008948

Version Date: 6-28-2023
STUDY00008948
Page 5 of 37 (V.04/27/2017)adverse effects of smoking. They found that although acute smoking caused a delay in myocardial 
relaxation, electronic cigarette use had no such immediate effects. Farsalinos et al10 also examined the 
effects on heart rate and blood pressure of switching from cigarettes to e-cigs in a smoking cessation 
trial, and reported that smokers who reduce or quit smoking by [CONTACT_667187] e-cigarettes may lower 
their systolic BP in the long term. While these and other studies confirm the known cardiopulmonary 
effects of acute smoke and other nicotine aerosol inhalation, they provide only limited information 
about the cardiopulmonary effects of e-cig use because they typi[INVESTIGATOR_834719] e-cig (usually a first generation or “cigalike” model), and focus more on the effects of change in 
smoking behavior rather than carefully assessing the effects of e-cig use per se. These studies have also 
included relatively basic cardiovascular outcomes (e.g., blood pressure and heart rate). These acute 
laboratory studies also typi[INVESTIGATOR_834720] a single device to study and were unable to examine the effects 
of chronic use of these products. One study has examined some effects in existing cohorts of (a) e-cig 
users who had quit smoking an average of 8 months earlier (b) cigarette smokers and (c) dual users over 
[ADDRESS_1159370] likely to remain tobacco abstinent 
(61%), but that dual users were more likely to return to exclusive smoking than to quit smoking. There 
were few serious adverse events and detailed cardiopulmonary measures were not systematically 
recorded. The only significant finding on health outcomes was that dual users experienced 
improvements in self-rated health compared with those who continued smoking. An earlier one year 
follow-up on these cohorts found that the exclusive e-cig users reported a small but significant 
improvement in self-reported health as compared with the smokers.[ADDRESS_1159371]

while those contact[CONTACT_461885] a link to complete the screening questions 
online ( https://redcap.ctsi.psu.edu/surveys/?s=TT37498THYA77JXK ). A full script and screening 
questions, as well the email and text script, specific to this study are in the “Consent Forms and 
Recruitment Materials” section of the IRB application. 
3. Screening 3 (In person, Visit 1):   After a participant has met basic eligibility criteria over the phone, 
they will be scheduled to come into the study center where they will be re-screened (using Screener 
2).  If the participant’s answers have changed from the phone screener (Screener 2) and they are no 
longer eligible, they will be informed that they cannot participate and they will be compensated for 
their travel via gift card ($15).  If they remain eligible, they will be consented to the study and 
further screened for eligibility. See section 7.2 for further details.   
5.0 Consent Process and Documentation
5.1 Consent Process 
5.1.1 Obtaining Informed Consent
[IP_ADDRESS] Timing and Location of Consent
When participants attend their first in person assessment visit, they will have 
the study explained to them in detail, have the opportunity to ask questions, 
and then will be asked to sign the consent form.  Participants will be given a 
signed copy of the form.  This will take place in a private clinic room at the Penn 
State Clinical Research Center.
[IP_ADDRESS] Coercion or Undue Influence during Consent
Once potential study volunteers are identified, they will be given information 
about the study and offered the opportunity to participate.  The researchers 
obtaining consent will be instructed to clearly indicate that the participant’s 
enrolling in the trial is purely voluntary and the researchers will not offer 
comments about whether they believe the participant should enroll in the study 
or not.  Given the number of contacts and visits involved in the study protocol, 
the compensation provided to the participant is modest.

7.2 Study Procedures
7.2.1 Screening (Phone) 
All participants will be screened over the phone to ensure potential eligibility for the study. 
Those potentially eligible will be scheduled an in-person visit. Subjects will be instructed to 
smoke their usual brand of cigarettes normally for the next 7 days, avoid using any other 
tobacco products, and to tally the number of cigarettes smoked per day.
7.2.2 Baseline (Consent/Randomization) Visit – Visit 1 [Day 0]
The following procedures will be completed in a private clinic space in the Clinical Research 
Center. Participants and researchers will be wearing appropriate PPE at all times, except for 
noted measures where the participant will need to remove their mask (when COVID protocols 
apply) . 
(Part A): Consent and Confirm Eligibility
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior to informed consent procedures, participants will complete the same 
screening questions that were completed over the phone previously (Screener 2 
via phone) to confirm eligibility (at Visit 1). Participants will be asked to provide, 
for visual inspection, a photo identification to verify their age. Provided 
identification must be valid (ie. not expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]), contain a photograph, a birthdate, 
and the name [CONTACT_834777]. If participant meets eligibility 
criteria assessed via screening at Visit 1, they will continue with Visit 1 and be 
asked to provide informed consent. Otherwise, the participant will be 
compensated for their travel to the visit, and the End of Trial Form will be 
completed.
[IP_ADDRESS] The participant will be provided with information about the study, will have the 
opportunity to ask questions, and will provide written consent to participate in 
the study. Participants will be provided with a copy of the consent form.
[IP_ADDRESS] The following measures will be completed:
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Medical history will be documented. Those with any conditions listed as 
exclusion criteria will be excluded.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Concomitant medication history will be recorded to ensure that the 
participant is not taking any medications that would exclude them from the

will last approximately 30-60 minutes. Interview questions will be related to the participant’s 
experience using the e-cig and attempting to switch completely from cigarettes. All interviews 
will be recorded and transcribed. In addition, participants will be asked to provide their past 7 
day cigarette (via 7 day TLFB) and e-cigarette use.
- We plan to recruit 40 participants to complete the interview part of the study. We plan to 
recruit participants who met the following criteria:

7.2.10 Daily Cigarette Diary and Daily E-cig Diary
During the entire study period (not including the follow-up phase), participants will be required 
to record the number of cigarettes smoked per day and study product use (after randomization) 
on provided paper-based diaries. Participants will be given an E-cigarette Daily Diary that also 
includes a space to record any cigarettes smoked. Researchers will enter daily diary totals in 
REDCap at each study contact [CONTACT_834760]. Daily diaries will stop after Visit [ADDRESS_1159404] (e.g., e-cig pods), or if the SREC product fails, 
they may call the research center to schedule a time to obtain additional products (in-person).  
Product may also be shipped to the participant’s home if they are not able to come to the study 
center in a timely manner.
7.2.12 Appointment Reminders
Phone call and/or text message reminders will be used throughout the study to remind 
participants of their next visits (approximately 1-2 days prior). In addition, when COVID 
protocols apply, participants will be sent a link to their phone or email to complete COVID 
symptom screener 24 hours before the visit. Also, visit time/date confirmation and study center 
directions will be emailed to the participant prior to Visit 1. (SEE APPOINTMENT REMINDER 
LETTER ATTACHMENT). For those without email, the first visit instructions will be explained to 
the participant over the phone. For participants who allow us to contact [CONTACT_834761], the study team will be using Google Voice to call or text participant 
reminders of the study visit and reminders to complete the study surveys with the REDCap 
survey link.  Google Voice is phone service that allows researchers to communicate with 
participants without revealing their personal phone numbers.  The study team will save 
participants phone number with their study ID.  Participants will be told not to share PHI 
through this phone number.  STUDY00008948

7.4.1 Description
The e-cig used will be a Standardized Research E-Cig (SREC). The SREC product is a pod-based 
device and comprises a replaceable pre-filled liquid reservoir (“pod”) and a rechargeable power 
supply unit. The SREC was designed for reliability and user convenience. Important features 
include: breath actuation, a tank and battery of sufficient capacity to satisfy smokers for >1 day 
on a single unit, primary packaging of the tank with excellent oxygen and water vapor barrier 
properties to ensure a long shelf life, and power control to maintain a constant aerosol output 
over the lifetime of the tank and battery charge. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data on the SREC 
with 58 mg/ml nicotine liquid suggests that 5 minutes of puffing (10 puffs) produces a C max of 
just over 21 ng/ml at around [ADDRESS_1159407] blood nicotine levels around 15 ng/ml. Both the 58 mg/ml (5%) and 0 mg/ml (0%) 
nicotine pods contain 1.9 ml of liquid, 50:50 propylene glycol: glycerin based with a tobacco 
flavor.
7.4.2 Treatment Regimen
Participants will be randomized to receive either a 0 mg/ml or 58 mg/ml nicotine liquid to be 
used with the SREC device. They will be told to use the SREC ad libitum as a replacement for 
conventional cigarette use.
7.4.[ADDRESS_1159408] to Treatment Groups
Participants will be randomized to  one of two conditions: a SREC with pods containing 0 mg/ml 
nicotine content (placebo) or a SREC with pods containing 58 mg/ml nicotine content (nicotine). 
Using a 1:1 allocation ratio, the randomization template was created by [CONTACT_1758]’s unblinded 
statistician via blocked randomization. The Randomization Module in REDCap will assign each 
participant to a 6-digit alpha-numeric code upon randomization at Visit 1. This code is unique to 
each randomized participant and is accessible to all study personnel. This code provides a 
blinded reference which identifies the SREC-device kit to be assigned and associated with the 
pharmacy device distribution. The utilization of this alpha-numeric code allows study personnel 
to be blinded from the nicotine dose while simultaneously distributing the devices to the STUDY00008948

randomized nicotine dose. This file does not exist in REDCap, is not stored on any shared 
accessible network drives, and is not accessible to any blinded study personnel (except in the 
event of an emergency situation that requires the breaking of the blind). 
In the event that REDCap is down during a Visit [ADDRESS_1159409] to review 
participants’ logs and to verify their daily conventional cigarette and e-cig use. Participants will 
also be asked to self-report their other tobacco use including products such as cigars, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], 
chew, snus, dip, hookah, and dissolvable tobacco. Exhaled carbon monoxide measurements and 
urine samples will be collected throughout the study to verify smoking intensity, nicotine, and 
cotinine levels.
Participants will be asked to return all of their used and unused study products and to bring 
their e-cigs to the study visits following randomization. At each of these visits, study staff will 
review the used pods to get an estimate of how much e-cig liquid was used by [CONTACT_2299]. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_1159410] linking the numeric code with the allocation, active 
(58 mg/ml) or placebo (0 mg/ml). 
Unblinded staff will appropriately package the pods and SREC parts into packs/kits for the 
participants. The kits will have assigned numbers, and the participants will be randomly assigned 
to a kit number at the randomization visit (Visit 2). The blinded researcher will not be involved in 
the packing and labelling of the kits and will only have access/knowledge of the alpha-numeric 
kit code assigned – but will remain blinded to the dose that each kit corresponds to. Only the 
study statisticians and packing/labeling personnel will be unblinded to the dose that each kit is 
linked to via randomization. All other study personnel, including lab staff, will remain blinded 
until the last randomized participant completes Phone Call #5 in the study follow-up phase at 
Week 10.

moisture.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation and Dispensing
The pods will come pre-filled in individually sealed packages. They will be 
prepared for participants by [CONTACT_834764]. 
Unblinded staff will appropriately package kits containing two SREC devices and 
a supply of filled pods for the participants. At Visit 1, following confirmation of 
eligibility for randomization, participants will be randomly assigned a kit 
number. The blinded researchers will not be involved in the packing and labeling 
of the kits. 
All receiving, sorting, blinding, and dispensing of the study product will be done 
in the TCORS  pharmacy space at Penn State in Room H7514.
[IP_ADDRESS] Return or Destruction of the Test Article
Participants will be dispose of their SREC device and all used and unused pods 
after completion of Phone Contact #5or if they are withdrawn. The devices 
provided to participants in this study are not commercially available and thus 
cannot be used without the pods provided in the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant medication use will be collected regularly throughout the trial and 
to monitor participant health conditions.  
Participants taking varenicline, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_264385] a smoking 
cessation medication in the prior month will be excluded from the study.  
Participants taking bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_834728].  Additionally, participants who are prescribed bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_834729].  Medications related to certain medical 
conditions that are exclusions to the study, such as COPD and current heart 
conditions, will serve to alert the study staff of the presence of these conditions 
during screening.  Once the participant is entered into the randomized double 
blind phase of the study, there are no medications that will interfere with the 
participant’s ability to participate.
8.[ADDRESS_1159411] Numbers and Statistical Plan
8.1 Number of Subjects
Participants will be enrolled in the study until a total of 240 are randomized. We anticipate that we will 
need to enroll up to 300 participants in order to randomize 240.
8.2 Sample size determination
We plan to randomize a total of 240 participants (120 in each dose group), and it is assumed that, 
although all efforts will be made to ensure 100% retention in the trial, as many as 30% of participants 
may drop-out after randomization. Thus, the effective sample size for this study could be as low as [ADDRESS_1159412] in-person study Visit 4. STUDY00008948

group’s post-treatment NNAL mean value be > 115), with at least 90% statistical power under 5% type 1 
error. 
8.3 Statistical methods
For the analysis, the baseline time will be Visit 1, prior to randomization to an e-cig nicotine content 
regimen (placebo or nicotine), which occurs at end of Visit 1. 
Summary statistics will be provided for baseline smoking characteristics, along with other study 
demographics collected upon enrollment/screening at Visit 1. Summary statistics will also be provided 
for all variables at each visit. This will include all randomized subjects. 
Aim 1:  For each battery of measures, the mean change from week 1 to week 6 will be estimated with a 
corresponding 95% confidence interval. The p-value for testing zero underlying change will also be 
provided. This analysis will be conducted separately for the two treatment arms. To adjust for multiple 
comparisons, the false discovery approach will be used. Additionally, the trajectory of each 
measurement at visit 1 visit 2 and visit 3 will be modeled using linear mixed effects regression.    
Aim 2:  The difference between the two treatment arms on markers of health risk will be analyzed. The 
primary conceptual framework is a modified intent-to-treat: subjects will be analyzed by [CONTACT_834766] e-cig nicotine content regimen, as long as data for 
the particular outcome is available at either of the post-randomization visits (Visit 2 or Visit 3). The basic 
statistical tool will be linear regression or logistic regression. Two sets of regressions will be conducted. 
The first set of regressions will model the dependence of the outcome measures at week [ADDRESS_1159414] for additional covariates at baseline (V1), to be selected via backward elimination 
at 0.[ADDRESS_1159415] based on 
appropriateness for the specific outcome variable.

the study at the time of V3) who have successfully abstained from cigarette and other tobacco use 
(except e-cigs) from 1 week prior to V2 consistently and consecutively until V3. Therefore, this subgroup 
would be defined as ‘quit’ for at least [ADDRESS_1159417] an exhaled 
CO < 6 ppm at both V2 and V3.  Based on our previous data, we believe that 40% of the nicotine e-cig 
group (84 x .40 = roughly 33 participants) and 20% of the placebo e-cig group (84 x .20 = roughly 16 
participants) will be classified as abstainers. For this relatively small subgroup, we shall only model the 
dependence of the outcome measures at week 6 on the two treatment arms while controlling for the 
baseline value of the outcome variable. No elaborate adjustment of other covariates will be included.
Aim 3:  The proportions of subjects who will try to abstain from cigarettes and who will continue to use 
an e-cig at week 10 will be compared between the two arms using Fisher’s exact test. Switching Phase 
dropouts will be treated as ‘non-abstainers’ from cigarettes under the ‘worst case-scenario’ assumption. 
A supplementary logistic regression will also be conducted to explore their dependence on demographic 
variables in addition to the two treatment arms.
Multiple imputation for missing values
We will strive to minimize the number of missing values by [CONTACT_834768]-up with the study subjects. In 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_39044], we still anticipate some missing values in the final datasets. Our basic tool to address this 
problem is multiple imputations. More specifically, if a variable is missing at V1, it will be imputed from 
the distribution of that variable of non-missing subjects. Due to the randomization at V1, non-missing 
subjects from both arms will be used for the distribution. For values missing at V3 (6 weeks after 
randomization), but non-missing at V2, the value collected at V2 will be carried forward in time via the 
LOCF (Last Observation Carried Forward) approach. For any instance where the participant remained in 
the trial, but did not provide data values at either post-randomization visit (V2 or V3), that case will be 
excluded from the analysis (modified ITT).

under medical supervision while in the study (i.e., by [CONTACT_7195]) and seen on an ongoing basis 
by [CONTACT_783838].  The medical monitor ([CONTACT_158916]) will 
assess adverse events and will consult with the pulmonologist on respi[INVESTIGATOR_525777].  The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the medical monitor will meet weekly with the study staff to review patient’s progress and their 
experiences with the study products, including any adverse events.  Entrance criteria will be reviewed 
following screening. Medical history will be reviewed by [CONTACT_5984], and based on eligibility criteria, 
any questionable medical histories will be brought to the attention of the medical monitor for final 
inclusion determination prior to randomization. In a similar manner, contraindications for the treatment 
products and vital signs will be checked by [CONTACT_783837]. The medical monitor will 
be available via phone for any consultations as necessary. In addition, the study coordinator/statistician 
will prepare a cumulative report of all data points listed below for the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee to review every 6 months after recruitment begins.
10.2 Data that are reviewed
The Data and Safety Monitoring Report will include: 
Accrual and retention
Medical history and concomitant medications
Adverse events and serious adverse events
Protocol deviations/violations
Misconduct
Conflict of interest
Participants’ ability to achieve study requirements
Changes in lung function via pulmonary function testing
Changes in lung function via the Clinical COPD questionnaire
10.3 Method of collection of safety information
All data, including safety data, will be coded directly into REDCap case report forms during study visits 
and during phone contacts.  Participant adverse events and serious adverse events will be assessed at 
each in-person study visit and phone call visit but can be reported at any time during the study.

10.7 Statistical tests
There are no planned interim statistical analyses for this study. Statistical summaries and reports for all 
enrolled study participants will be generated for periodic DSMB Review. Reports will include 
summarized data and information pertaining to participant recruitment and accrual, study retention-
dropout rate (withdrawals, lost to follow up, Switching Phase completion, Trial completion), (serious) 
adverse events, pulmonary function, and any other safety data requested by [CONTACT_4318] (such as blood 
pressure, heart rate, weight, CO increases, etc.). The DSMB will meet to determine the desired format 
for the reports and the requested content (e.g. individual-level data, aggregate summary data, etc.). The 
data presented/reported will not be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], thus allowing the reviews to occur 
in a blinded fashion for the DSMB, the PI, the study team, and the statisticians generating the reports.

11.0 Risks
11.1 E-cig use: There may be some unknown risks related to the use of e-cigs.
11.1.[ADDRESS_1159422] common side effects associated with using an e-cig are changes in taste, dehydration, 
mucus in throat/sinus, dry mouth, dry cough, throat irritation, mouth irritation, nasal 
congestion, sore throat, mouth ulcers, rash, dizziness, difficulty breathing, heart palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
abnormal heart rate, headache, stomach discomfort, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and hiccups.
11.1.[ADDRESS_1159423] been some reports of serious lung illnesses among those who used e-cigarettes, and 
even some cases of death as a result.  The cause of all these deaths has not been identified. The 
investigations being conducted by [CONTACT_7698] (CDC) and the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have found that the majority of people experiencing these 
illnesses were using e-cigarette products that contained tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and/or 
products that were bought off the street and not from retail establishments.  The e-cigarette 
products used in this study do not contain THC and were bought from manufacturers where STUDY00008948

Page 28 of 37 (V.04/27/2017)quality testing and control is performed.  Nonetheless, participants will be advised to call their 
doctor immediately if they experience cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, or fever after using their e-cigarette.  Participants will be told to only use the e-
cigarette and liquid pods (cartridges) given to them by [CONTACT_461904] e-cigarette or use other liquids with the e-cigarette device.
11.2 Nicotine addiction: Participants may be given an e-cig that contains nicotine, which is an addictive 
substance. The amount of nicotine they receive from this product depends on what product they are 
given and how they use it.
11.3 Nicotine withdrawal symptoms: Ceasing conventional cigarette use may result in nicotine withdrawal 
symptoms (e.g., irritability, anxiety, restlessness, depressed mood, increased appetite, fatigue, difficulty 
concentrating). These symptoms will be monitored at each visit.
11.4 New development of pregnant or want to become pregnant: Nicotine, from cigarettes and from e-cigs, 
is known to be harmful to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_18081]. Women who are pregnant or are nursing a child 
may not participate in this research study. Females capable of becoming pregnant will be administered a 
pregnancy test prior to beginning the research. Participants must agree to take reasonable and 
necessary precautions against becoming pregnant during the period of the investigation. 
11.5 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]: Risks associated with spi[INVESTIGATOR_461865], dizziness, headache and 
on rare occasions fainting while doing the breathing test. Every effort will be made to limit these effects 
during the procedure.  Participants with medical conditions that may place them at increased risk are 
being excluded.
11.[ADDRESS_1159424]: There is little risk associated with a Holter EKG, however, discomfort may include minor 
skin irritation or localized allergic skin reaction. These reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_834733].
11.7 Loss of confidentiality: There is a risk of loss of confidentiality if information is obtained by [CONTACT_609720]. Precautions will be taken to prevent this including direct coding of data in 
REDCap.
11.8 Randomization in clinical trials: Participants will be assigned to a research intervention by [CONTACT_3364]. The 
research intervention they receive may prove to have more side effects than the other research 
intervention(s).
11.9 Questionnaires: It is possible that some of the questions in the questionnaires may make participants 
uncomfortable. They will be instructed that they are free to skip any questions that make them 
uncomfortable. In addition, at Visit 1, participants will be provided with a handout listing local, state and 
national resources for those who may want to seek out additional support (see Community Resources 
document).
11.10 (Optional Visit Only) Blood Draws:  Blood draws often cause mild pain, swelling or bleeding.  There may 
be some bruising (blood under the surface of the skin), which will be minimized by [CONTACT_834770].  There is a slight chance that a blood clot will develop at the site of the 
catheter.  There is also a slight chance of infection (less than 1 in 10,000), dizziness, or fainting.  These 
risks will be minimized and most likely eliminated by [CONTACT_834771] a clinical setting 
using sterile supplies.  If dizziness or fainting occurs, the symptoms will be alleviated by [CONTACT_834772].

13.0 Sharing Results with Subjects
This study is not designed to diagnose any disease or condition.  However, if during the course of conducting 
clinical procedures (e.g., blood pressure, lung function), a participant is found to have a result outside of clinical 
norms, the result will be discussed with the participant (blood pressure, lung function, EKG result).  The 
participant will be given a letter at the next visit indicating what procedure was done and will direct them to 
contact a medical provider for further evaluation. If a woman tests positive for pregnancy, the results will be 
shared with the participant, they will be withdrawn from the study, and they will be advised to follow up with 
their doctor for prenatal medical care.  If at any time participants request copi[INVESTIGATOR_834734], they will be 
provided with copi[INVESTIGATOR_834735].  After the trial has completed, 
participants will be sent a letter providing them with their study condition.
14.[ADDRESS_1159426] Stipend (Compensation) and/or Travel Reimbursements
Total compensation for study completion is $150 ($165 if completing optional part of the study). Actual payment 
will vary according to the number and type of contacts completed by [CONTACT_6992].
The payment will be provided by [CONTACT_834773]. This reimbursement will be issued by [CONTACT_834774], which will issue your reimbursement. The participant will be issued a ClinCard, 
which is a debit card that funds are loaded onto and can be used at the participant’s discretion.  The research 
team will give Greenphire some personal information about the participant, as described below. Greenphire will 
only use the personal information to process this reimbursement and will not share it with anyone for any other 
purpose. If the card is lost, the participant may be responsible for the replacement fee. When the visit is 
completed, funds will be approved and loaded onto the card.  The funds will be available within 2-[ADDRESS_1159427], Greenphire will need the Study/Subject ID, 
participant’s name, Address, and date of birth. The participant will have the option to receive updates related to 
payment alerts via text message and/or email message. Standard text messaging rates will apply. In order to 
send these messages Greenphire, the participant will need to provide their Mobile Phone Number and/or E-mail 
Address.

including the at-home questionnaires 
Subjects who complete all three in-person study visits will receive an extra incentive of $35 
upon completion of Visit 3. 
14.2 Phone Contacts
Compensation for each completed phone call will be $5, payable by a cumulative lump sum on the 
Greenphire ClinCard upon completion of Phone Contact #5. The actual amount of this sum will be 
determined by [CONTACT_834775]. The total for completing all 5 phone calls in the 
study will be $25, upon completion of Phone Contact #5. If a participant did not complete any phone 
calls during the study, or if they did not complete Phone Contact #5, they will not receive any of the 
potential $25 compensation.

19.1 Adverse Event Definitions
For drug studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, as written:
Adverse event Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related
Adverse reaction Any adverse event caused by a drug
Suspected adverse 
reactionAny adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”.
Reasonable possibility.   For the purpose of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.
Serious adverse 
event or Serious 
suspected adverse 
reactionSerious adverse event or Serious suspected adverse reaction: An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the investigator 
or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-
threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. 
Life-threatening 
adverse event or 
life-threatening 
suspected adverse 
reactionAn adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator (i.e., the study site 
principal investigator) or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or research 
subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.
Unexpected 
adverse event or An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if 
it is not listed in the investigator brochure, general investigational plan, clinical STUDY00008948

specificity or severity that has been previously observed and/or specified.
Unanticipated 
adverse device 
effectAny serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem 
or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan 
or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
19.2 Recording of Adverse Events
Research subjects will be routinely questioned about adverse events at in-person study visits and during 
scheduled phone contacts.
All adverse events (serious or non-serious) and abnormal test findings observed or reported to study 
team believed to be associated with the study will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the 
abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.
An abnormal test finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the following criteria are 
met:
The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical intervention; 
including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy
oNote: Simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed criteria, 
does not constitute an adverse event. 
The test finding leads to a change in study drug dosing or discontinuation of subject 
participation in the clinical research study
The test finding is considered an adverse event by [CONTACT_093].
In addition, we will be monitoring lung function throughout the study using pulmonary function testing. 
Any significant worsening (10% worsening or greater) in pulmonary function will be documented as an 
adverse event. 
19.3 Causality and Severity Assessments
The medical monitor ([CONTACT_158916]) will review documented adverse events and abnormal test 
findings on a weekly basis to determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse 
event; 2) if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257](s) or 
device(s); and 3) if the adverse event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event. For more urgent 
and/or serious adverse events, the medical monitor will be available for consultation by [CONTACT_834776] (ie. Emergency room). The medical monitor will then make 
any needed medical recommendations and a determination regarding whether the participant is able to 
continue with the study. In cases where the medical monitor suspects that a participant may be having a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_461869], a pulmonologist ([CONTACT_461916]) will be consulted. The 
pulmonologist will make any needed medical recommendations and a determination regarding whether 
the participant is able to continue with the study. 
If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the 
study drug(s) or device(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the study 
drug(s) or device(s) for reporting purposes.  If the investigator’s final determination of causality is 
“unknown but not related to the study drug(s) or device(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the 
determination will be documented in the respective subject’s case history.STUDY00008948

20.0 Study Monitoring, Auditing and Inspecting
20.1 Study Monitoring Plan
20.1.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control
Data will be collected from participants and coded directly by [CONTACT_783842] (participant entered data) or through REDCap data entry forms (researcher entered data).  
The codes that link the name [CONTACT_783844]. Any paper forms (consent) will be securely transported to the PI’s data entry center.  
Any additional data that is generated (i.e., electronic PFT and EKG test results), will be stored 
electronically on the PHS server in password protected files.
Study data will be managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is a 
secure web application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing user-
friendly web-based case report forms, real-time data entry validation (e.g. for data types and 
range checks), audit trails and a de-identified data export mechanism to common statistical 
packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S-Plus). The system was developed by a multi-institutional 
consortium which includes The Pennsylvania State University and was initiated at Vanderbilt 
University. The database is hosted at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center and College of 
Medicine data center, which will be used as a central location for data processing and 
management. REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study-specific data dictionary STUDY00008948

STUDY00008948
Page 35 of 37 (V.04/27/2017)defined in an iterative self-documenting process by [CONTACT_59881]. This 
iterative development and testing process results in a well-planned data collection strategy for 
individual studies. 
REDCap is HIPAA compliant. Data are stored on a secure server; data in REDCap are encrypted; 
access to the database requires authentication (a unique username [CONTACT_2383]); data are 
accessed based on the individual’s role on the project; every interaction with the data is logged, 
creating an audit trail.
Random data entry checks will be implemented regularly to identify problems with data entry.  
Data quality tools included in REDCap will be utilized to identify incorrect data types, out of 
range data and outliers.  In addition, electronic edit checks, and random internal quality and 
assurance checking will be performed manually.  Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_783843]. If necessary, re-training of researchers will be 
conducted.
The responsibility for data quality and study conduct lies with the PI.  
20.1.2 Safety Monitoring
The DSMB will monitor the safety of study participants. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_834736] (AE) are correctly entered into the AE case report forms by [CONTACT_408308]; be available to answer any questions that the coordinators may have concerning 
AEs; and will notify the IRB, FDA, sponsor and/or DSMB of all applicable AEs as appropriate. All 
final assessments of AEs will be made by a licensed medical professional who is an investigator 
on the research. 
The research coordinator will ensure that AEs are correctly entered into REDCap and complete 
the appropriate report form and logs; assist the PI [INVESTIGATOR_264396], FDA, 
and/or DSMB of all Unanticipated Problems/SAE’s.
21.0 Future Undetermined Research: Data and Specimen Banking
Blood and urine will be banked for future undetermined research for all participants.   Before samples are used 
or shared, the participant’s identity we will be removed. 
21.1 Data and/or specimens being stored
Specimens will be stored with an ID code attached.  The location of the specimen in the study freezer 
will be managed using Freezerworks database which will be housed on the PHS password secured 
network.  The code number, visit number, date/time of collection, processing and storage, and consent 
options for future use of samples will be stored in Freezerworks in addition to REDCap.  All other data 
associated with the ID code will be retained in REDCap.
21.2 Location of storage
Specimens will be stored a locked freezer room in the research laboratory of Drs. Muscat & Foulds on 
the 3rd floor of the Cancer Institute.  
21.3 Duration of storage
Specimens will be stored indefinitely with code number attached.  Data will be stored indefinitely with 
identifiers attached in REDCap and no identifiers in Freezerworks.STUDY00008948

Page 36 of 37 (V.04/27/2017)21.4 Access to data and/or specimens
The lab managers, technicians, study coordinators, and PI [INVESTIGATOR_461870].  The researchers will have access to the stored data in REDCap, although 
role-specific rights will be granted to forms (i.e., researchers who see participants will not have access to 
data that may allow them to become unblinded to a participant’s treatment allocation).
21.[ADDRESS_1159438]. Foulds will then take the proposal to 
the overall Penn State Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (TCORS) steering committee for review and 
approval.  If the proposal is approved, the investigator will then need to obtain all other regulatory 
approvals (IRB, departmental scientific committees, etc.) prior to samples being released.  Only de-
identified data, as approved in the investigator’s IRB application, will be released to the investigator.  
Blood and urine samples will only be released if the participant provided written consent to allow their 
samples to be used by [CONTACT_127761] (this option is included in the original consent form).  
21.6 Process for returning results
Investigators will be required to provide a written report on their study results to the TCORS steering 
committee. Individual participants will not be provided with the results of the analyses of their samples.

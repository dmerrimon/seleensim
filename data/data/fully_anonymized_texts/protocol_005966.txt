Date: 9/14/2018  4 PART  II: STUDY  DESCRIPTION  
1.0 Background  
1.1 Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_548091] 800,000 
patients in the [LOCATION_002] each year.1 Approximately half of these patients are > 65 
years old,1 a vulnerable group at high  risk for poor short - and long -term outcomes. Even 
among younger patients, mortality among mechanically ventilated ICU patients is 
extremely high, with in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548092] 35% for all patients and 
approaching 50% for syndromes like ARDS.1-3 Costs for these patients are also high, 
with an estimated $[ADDRESS_717428] led to better clinical outcomes, such that 70% -80% of 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients recover to the point of extubation.2,4 The current 
evidence -based management of these patients is to extubate once the patient passes a 
spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and is alert with adequate cough and minimal 
secretions. This SBT -based  strategy, especially when paired with sedation interruption, 
greatly improves outcomes,5,[ADDRESS_717429] found that 10% to 20% of patien ts 
recovering from acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_548093],2,[ADDRESS_717430] in elderly 
patients4,7,10 and patients with chronic pulmonary disease.7,10 In one recent study, 24% 
of mechanically ventilated ICU patients were both >65 ye ars old and had chronic cardiac 
or respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765] —these patients had a reintubation rate of 34% compared with 
9% among other patients (p<0.01).[ADDRESS_717431] -Extubation No ninvasive Ventilation  (NIV)  
When a mechanically ventilated patient with high risk  characteristics passes an SBT, 
clinicians must decide whether to extubate. Continuing invasive mechanical ventilation 
exposes the patient to risk and undue burden, but extubating without providing support 
is also undesirable. Post -extubation noninvasive v entilation offers clinicians a third 
option. In a landmark randomized controlled trial, Ferrer et al.13 studied high -risk 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients and found that extubation to immediate 
noninvasive ventilation (rather than conventional oxygen treatme nt) reduced both post -
extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (RR = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.15 –0.62) and 90 -day mortali ty (RR 
= 0.36: 95%CI: 0.15 -0.85). A subsequent meta -analysis of five randomized controlled 
trials demonstrated that post -extubation noninvasive ventilation  improves multiple 
outcomes, including post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], ICU length of stay, and 
mortality.13-[ADDRESS_717432] Ph ysicians 
(ACCP) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and co -chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Girard (PI [INVESTIGATOR_548094]: METEOR: Think NIV Pi[INVESTIGATOR_548085] 1.0  
Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  5 study ), made a strong recommendation  that high -risk patients who pass an SBT should 
be extubated to preventive noninvasive ventilation.18-20 A similar recommendation was 
made in guidelines published by [CONTACT_548125][INVESTIGATOR_3764] (ERS) and ATS, which 
were co -authored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Hess (a consultant  for this study ).[ADDRESS_717433] studies, for example, found that  even though nearly 50% of 
invasively ventilated patients had a risk factor for failed extubation, less than 3%  
received preventative noninvasive ventilation after extubation.[ADDRESS_717434] 200,000 m echanically ventilated 
patients/year in the [LOCATION_002] are at high risk for extubation failure. If post -
extubation noninvasive ventilation leads to a 9% absolute reduction in mortality for this 
vulnerable population, as estimated in a recent meta -analys is,18-[ADDRESS_717435] team, individual providers wi ll find ways to circumvent even 
newer strategies like electronic prompts, making these interventions only modestly 
effective.37 It is essential that the next generation of implementation strategies 
acknowledge and account for this complexity so that they empower interprofessional 
teams with the skills to overcome challenges to implementation of evidence -based 
practice as they dynamically arise as well as sustain improvement after the novelty of 
the new intervention has worn off.

Date: 9/14/[ADDRESS_717436] transactive memory syste m, team members 
can rely each other to recall and apply key knowledge about important tasks. This 
“mutual confidence” frees up each individual team member to deepen their own 
expertise while at the same time ensuring that their knowledge remains accessible  to 
others.[ADDRESS_717437] implementation work can be addressed by [CONTACT_548126]: interprofessional education  
and just-in-time education . 
• Interprofessional education: Traditional continuing education focuses on 
individuals and occurs in professional silos —physicians learning from physicians, 
nurses l earning from nurses, etc. As a result, the individual professions acquire 
different mental models and lack a shared understanding of the task at hand. 
Interprofessional education, in which members of different providers learn together, 
overcomes this probl em by [CONTACT_548127]42,[ADDRESS_717438] accurate 
understandings of each other’s’ mental models.44 Interprofessional education fosters 
the development of a shared language or common set of terms, which enables 
effective coordination. Int erprofessional education also helps ensure that new 
knowledge occurs in a supportive context, enabling individuals to jointly practice 
coordinated actions in a team -based setting, promoting knowledge retention through 
the development of transactive memory systems.45 
• Just-in-time education: Traditional continuing education occurs in classrooms or 
at home, separate from the “moment of  need” and divorced from the practical 
context. Just -in-time education overcomes this problem by [CONTACT_548128].[ADDRESS_717439]-in-time 
education also strengthens transactive memory systems by [CONTACT_548129] —instead of depending on subsequent experience 
to reinforce knowledge, knowledge acquisition and experience occur 
simultaneously.[ADDRESS_717440] -in-time education ties knowledge acquisition to a 
specific case of immediate relevance,49,50 reducing ambiguity in the learning process.

2.0 Objective  and Hypothesis  
2.1 Objective  
During the METEOR: Think NIV Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116], we seek to pi[INVESTIGATOR_548095] -extubation  noninvasive ventilation: one 
control strategy (traditional online continuing medical education) and two novel 
strategies (interprofessional education and just -in-time education).  
2.[ADDRESS_717441] -in-time education are feasible 
and acceptable to members of the interdisciplinary ICU team; and that the pi[INVESTIGATOR_548096]. 
3.0 Study Population and Enrollment  
3.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
Two study populations will be included.  
• Learners  will include [1] frontline care providers, including physicians, advanced 
practice providers, nurses, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175], [2] working in one of three 
participating UPMC ICUs: UPMC Presby[CONTACT_548124], UPMC Mercy MSICU, and UPMC 
Passavant MSICU.  
• Patients will include all mechanically ventilated patients treated in the participating 
UPMC ICUs and surviving to extubation.  
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Care providers will be excluded from the Learner population if they:  
[1] Have not worked in their current UPM C ICU  for more than one month  
[2] Have not directly cared for a mechanically ventilated patient in a UPMC ICU 
during the three months preceding the current study  
3.3 Enrollment  
Study personnel  will provide  nursing and medical managers from each participating ICU 
with an introduc tory script that  explain the study’s methods and goals. Uni t leadership 
will provide potential learners with the script, inviting them to participate  and describing 
the study procedures and potential risks and benefits. Because exemptions 45 CFR 
46.101(b)(1) and 45 CFR 46.101(b)( 4) apply and it will not be practicable to obtain 
informed consent, we will request a waiver to document informed consent fro m learners 
(whose actions will indicate their consent to participate) and a waiver to request

4.0 Study Procedures  
4.1 Pre-Education Survey  
Prior to receiving the educational interventions, learners will be asked to complete a 10 -
minute survey designed to assess their baseline knowledge.  
4.2 Educational  Interventions  
During a one -month study intervention period, the following three educational 
interventions will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_548097].  
• Traditional  online continuing education . We will use an active control 
consisting of “best existing practice” for continuing education. Learners  working in 
the ICU assigned to this arm will be offered a [ADDRESS_717443]-extubation NIV. The video will be customized to each provider type  (e.g., 
nurse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_105489], or physician). Learners will be  offered provid er-specific 
continuing education credits . 
• Interprofessional  education . Learners  working in the ICU assigned to this arm 
will receive, a one -time, 90 -120-minute, in -person, interprofessional educational 
workshop consisting of a 30 -minute didactic session an d a 60 -90-minute small group 
session. The workshop is designed according to modern principles of adult learning 
and interprofessional education, including provider participation in development, 
fostering authenticity, reinforcing role identity, and relatin g content to life 
experience. Facilitators will be trained advance practice providers with content 
expert ise who can speak to all targeted professions.  Research staff will observe 
educational sessions.  
• Just-in-time education . Learners  working in the ICU assigned to this arm will 
receive, “just -in-time,” point -of-care education. Trained advanced practice providers 
will be on -hand in the study ICU , where they will deliver the just -in-time education .

4.4 Statistical  Considerations  
We will use interrupted  time series  analysis  to compare  clinical  outcomes  measured  
during  the six months  before  the implementation  strategies  with those  measured  during  
the six months  after initiation  of the strategies.52 All analyses  will be adjusted  for 
baseline  characteristics  associated  with the outcomes,  including  age, comorbid  
conditions,  and severity  of illness  at admission.  Additionally,  interaction  terms  will be 
used to determine  whether  age and chronic  cardiac  and/or  respi[INVESTIGATOR_548098].  
 
Due to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_548099],  we do not yet have preliminary  data with which  to 
perform  power  calculations  or sample  size analyses.  The sample  size will therefore  be 
determined  by [CONTACT_5870]  (i.e., the number  of learners  who agree  to participate  and the 
number  of eligible  patients  admitted  to participati ng ICUs during  the study  period),  and 
we will use the results  of the current  pi[INVESTIGATOR_548100] a 
subsequent  cluster  randomized  trial.

and participants  will be identified by [CONTACT_548131] a number and not by [CONTACT_2300] (e.g. , 
Intensivist 1, Nurse 4, etc.). Interviews will be held in private locations.  
De-identified patient  data will be collected  from the electronic health record and the ICU 
Registr y. These data will includ e, but not  be limited to, in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548101] a t

respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], duration of mechanical ventilation, 28 -day ventilator -free days, 
ventilator -associated pneumonia, and organ failure (tracked daily using the Sequen tial 
Organ Failure Assessment score ). 
5.0 Protection of Human Participants  
5.1 Potential Risks  
Since the interventions being studied are educational strategies applied to care providers 
rather than to patients, we anticipate that potential risk to patient particip ants will be 
limited to accidental disclosure of protected health information should there be a breach 
in our data security procedures. Potential risk to learner participants includes 
psychological discomfort associated with completing the surveys, which w ill address 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_548102]. Given that these topi[INVESTIGATOR_548103] a non -sensitive nature, we believe 
psychological discomfort will occur infrequently. An additional risk is accidental publi c 
disclosure of a participant’s survey results. For this to occur, a survey must be 
accidentally misplaced and the unique key linking the participant’s survey to the ICU 
identifiers must also be misplaced, and each must be recovered by [CONTACT_3194], a 
series of events that is extremely unlikely. A final risk is that learner participants could 
feel pressured to participate by [CONTACT_548132] a researcher and worry that their 
professional relationships will be jeopardized if they refuse. For our past wor k, the 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_548104] “minimal risk” under the Department of Health and Human Services Code of 
Federal Regulations because it involved social research methods (e.g., surveys) a nd 
because the probability and magnitude of physical and psychological harm is similar to 
that normally encountered in daily life.

demographic  description  of the cohort  (age, gender,  job category,  time in service);  thus, 
interview  participants  will not be identifiable  in any way. All voice recordings  will be 
destroyed  after transcription.  All personal  identifiers  will be redacted  by [CONTACT_548133],  
and all transcriptions  will be triple-read to ensure  that they contain  no potential  
identifiers.  We will contact  [CONTACT_548134]: METEOR: Think NIV Pi[INVESTIGATOR_548085] 1.0

Informed  consent  documents  will be source  documents  kept in the study  coordinator’s  
locked  files. Only key personnel  will have access.  All data will be kept for an indefinite  
amount  of time at the University  of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_548105].  
5.4 Data  and Safety Monitoring Plan  (DSMP)  
5.4.1  Adherence Statement  
The DSMP outlined herein  will adhere to the study protocol approved by [CONTACT_159543][INVESTIGATOR_68348] . The study  will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, 
International Conference on Harmonization guideline E6: Good Clinical Practice (ICH 
E6): Consolidated Guideline, and the applicable regulatory requirements from United 
States (US) Code of Federa l Regulations (CFR) (Title 45 CFR Parts 46 and Title 21 CFR 
including Parts 50 and 56) concerning informed consent and Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) regulations . 
5.4.[ADDRESS_717450] (DSMB)  
As described in detail in the METEOR: Think NIV Pil ot Study DSMB Charter, a Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  will be created, consist ing of three voting members 
with expertise in clinical research methodology and critical care medicine.  DSMB 
responsibilities are to:  
• protect the safety of the study p articipants;  
• review the research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring;  
• evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality 
and timeliness, recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, 
performance of the trial sites, and other factors that can affect study outcome;  
• conside r factors external to the study when relevant information becomes 
available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an 
impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial;  
• make recommendations to the Principal Investig ator concerning continuation, 
termination or other modifications of the trial based on the observed beneficial or 
adverse effects of the treatment under study; and  
• ensure the confidentiality of the study data and the results of monitoring.  
The DSMB will ha ve one planned meeting before the intervention period. Additionally, 
the DSMB Chair, the Principal Investigator, or the NHLBI may call a meeting of the 
DSMB at any time.  Though unexpected given the minimal risk nature of the study, any 
serious adverse even ts that are suspected by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_548106] —events referred to as Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse 
Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) —as well as any other AE report that the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_548107] r DSMB review will be reviewed by [CONTACT_45453]. The DSMB 
Protocol Title: METEOR: Think NIV Pi[INVESTIGATOR_548085] 1.0  
Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  12 Chair may distribute S[LOCATION_003]R reports to the other DSMB members for review. If a S[LOCATION_003]R 
occurs, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_548108] a report to the DSMB Chair within 48 hours 
for review. The DSMB Cha ir will then indicate via email within 96 hours if additional 
information is required and whether additional action is recommended secondary to 
review of the S[LOCATION_003]R (e.g., DSMB teleconference).  
5.4.3  Confidentiality  
Protection of Participant Privacy:  We will take extensive precautions to guard against 
disclosure of protected health information and maintain participant confidentially. All 
data management and analysis activities will take place on CRISMA’s secure, HIPAA -
compliant servers behind the UPMC  firewall. Patient data will be obtained from the 
approved ICU Registry. Data in the registry is  downloaded directly from the electronic 
health record (E HR) via secure FTP. No data containing any protected health information 
will ever leave the secure serv er. All investigators, programmers, and analysts working 
with the files will sign a confidentially agreement committing them to full privacy. We 
will also take several steps to protect the privacy of learner  participants. Paper survey 
forms using during educational sessions  will only include the participant’s unique study 
ID and no other identifying information. Thus, if the survey form is lost, it will not be 
directly linkable to the participant without additional information. And, we will store the 
partic ipant study ID linkage key on our secure, password -protected, HIPAA -compliant 
server, which is maintained according to strict federal security standards. This key will 
be destroyed after data collection is complete.  
 
Database Protection:  All data managemen t and analysis activities will take place on 
CRISMA’s secure, HIPAA -compliant servers behind the UPMC firewall. No data containing 
any protected health information will ever leave the secure server.  
 
Confidentiality during Adverse Event (AE) Reporting:  Adverse event reports and annual 
summaries to regulatory bodies will not include participant -or group -identifiable 
material. Each report will only include the identification code.  
5.4.4  Adverse Event Information  
Clinical Outcomes (Not Considered Adverse Events).  In this study of critically ill patients 
who are at high risk for death or other adverse outcomes due to their underlying critical 
illness, clinical outcomes, including death and organ dysfunction, will be systematically 
tracked and will be included as part of the safety and effectiveness analyses for this 
study. For the purposes of reporting, death and organ dysfunction will not be recorded 
as adverse events ( AEs) unless the investigator believes the event may have been 
related to study participation or is m ore severe or prolonged than expected given the 
underlying critical illness. This approach —considering death and organ dysfunction as 
outcomes rather than AEs and systemically tracking expected safety outcomes for 
analysis rather than solely recording indi vidual AEs —is common during critical care trials 
because these outcomes/events occur frequently in the ICU, and this system mandates 
that data regarding death, organ dysfunction, and expected safety outcomes be tracked 
systematically for all patients and a nalyzed appropriately. Listed below are events that 
will be tracked as clinical outcomes and will not therefore be reported as AEs during this 
Protocol Title: METEOR: Think NIV Pi[INVESTIGATOR_548085] 1.0  
Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  13 study (unless believed to be study related and/or more severe or prolonged than 
expected given the underlying cri tical illness):  
• Death  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], including need for mechanical ventilation (invasive or 
noninvasive) or epi[INVESTIGATOR_548109]  
• Circulatory failure, including shock (whether requiring vasopressors or not) and 
cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension  
• Hepatic failure or injury leading to increased bilirubin, AST, or ALT  
• Renal failure or injury leading to an  increased creatinine or acute hemodialysis  
• Coagulation derangements leading to elevated PT/INR or PTT, DIC, 
thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytosis  
• Cogni tive impairment that is believed to be newly acquired  
• Alterations in vital signs (e.g., temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oxygen saturation)  
• Falls 
• Pressure ulcers  
• Thromboembolisms  
• ICU readmissions  
• Infections  
• Self-removal of devices and invasive tubing and/or monitoring equipment  
• Alterations in routine labs, including chemistries, complete blood counts, liver 
function tests, and creatine kinase  
 
Adverse Event (AE) Classifications . We define an  AE as any untoward medical 
occurrence for a study participant  that is not tracked as a clinical outcome, regardless of 
whether the event  is considered study related or not. All AEs  will be assessed as to 
whether they are (1) related to study participation, (2) serious, and/or (3) unexpected 
according to the followin g definitions:  
Related . AEs that an investigator suspects are related to study participation  will 
be classified as Suspected Adverse Reactions (SARs). A high degree of certainty of 
relatedness is not required as long as a reasonable possibility exists that  the AE is 
related to study participation.  
Serious . AEs that result in any criteria below will be considered Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs):  
• Death  
• A life-threatening epi[INVESTIGATOR_548110]  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94137]  
• Persistent or significant incapacitation or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• An epi[INVESTIGATOR_548111]/or 
permanent impairment or damage  
Unexpected . AEs, including SARs, that are more severe or prolonged than 
expected will be considered Unexpected.  
 
All events that are related , unexpected , and serious  will be reported as Serious 
Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs).  Given that all known risks of 
participation in the proposed study qualify as minimal risks, we do not anticipate any

Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/[ADDRESS_717451] established this system for monitoring and reporting 
should such as event occur.  
 
Unanticipated Pro blems (UP). Per OHRP and NHLBI regulations and guidance, any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria  will be reported 
as a UP: 1) unexpected, 2) related  or possibly related to participation in the research,  
and 3) suggests  that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously known or recognized.  Per this definition, all S[LOCATION_003]Rs will also be

 I.  Need and Target Population:  
The Significance of the Problem of Headache after TBI : Since there are over [ADDRESS_371740] 5 years has indicated that approximately 70% of persons with TBI 
complain of headache in the  year following their injury,19 though only about 17%   have had a 
prior history of headache before injury.  
Military figures also support the common occurrence of PTH. A lmost 20% of Operation 
Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans are thought to have 
experienced a traumatic brain injury .3, [ADDRESS_371741] on Target Population  
Why is treatment of PTH important ? In general, beyond the work that we have conducted 
(see Figure 2  below), little research has been directed at the functional impact  of chronic PTH. 
Cohen et al33 found that headache, including PTH, was a significant cause of unit attrition in 
TWIST: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371742] 
10% of people missed work because of a headache and 31% felt that their work effectiveness 
was reduced.[ADDRESS_371743] of $[ADDRESS_371744] may slow rehabilitation 
efforts and successful re -entry into employment a nd other areas of productive activity.  
 
IV. Preliminary Data  
Prior work on PTH at the UWTBIMS : In the prior cycle, we led a multicenter study, 
which prospectively followed a cohort of [ADDRESS_371745]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371746] of headache on normal function. Subjects were interviewed by [CONTACT_27329] v ia telephone at 3, 6, and 12 months after injury with a headache survey including 
frequency, severity, and characteristics.  
The prevalence of PTH was high with over 40% of participants reporting headache at 
every time point measured (3, 6, and 12 months) a fter injury, indicating that PTH is a very 
common and persistent problem for those with brain injury. An astonishing cumulative 71% of 
the cohort reported PTH at some point during the first year after injury (see Figure 1). Two 
factors were found to be sig nificantly related to the occurrence of PTH, prior history of headache 
and female gender. In this study, we found that 22 -29% of the sample reported frequent 
headaches (multiple times per week/daily). This stands in contrast to what is reported for the 
non-brain injured general population in which 4 -5% report chronic daily headache (greater than 
15 days per month).38-[ADDRESS_371747]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache

Recently, we reported the preliminary results of the second natural history study of PTH after 
mild TBI.41 We enrolled 220 persons admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_303925]. Baseline prevalence of headache prior to i njury was 
17%. However, prevalence at 3 months was 73%, at 6 months 79%, and at 12 months 67%, even 
higher rates than for those with moderate -severe TBI. The majority of these headaches appeared 
to have characteristics of migraine or probable migraine head ache. At 12 months, 25% had 
headaches that occurred several times a week. Impaired function (inability to engage in daily 
activities including work, school, household, or social activities) due to headaches was reported 
even by [CONTACT_303953] 2 which is consistent with 
reports from those with moderate to severe TBI. More than 50% of reported headaches at [ADDRESS_371748] by [CONTACT_125225]  0102030405060708090100

Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371749] been  opposing points of view regarding the association of head injury 
severity and incidence of headaches where some believe that headaches occur primarily in mild 
injuries and oth ers disagree.17, 18, 21 Our research indicates that headaches are common in all 
severities of TBI although the prevalence is higher in mild TBI .42  
PTH falls into the category of secondary headache. The International Headache Society 
(IHS) defines a secondary he adache as one that occurs de novo with another disorder 
recognized to be capable of causing it, e.g., traumatic brain injury causing a PTH .[ADDRESS_371750]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371751] frequently as m igraine or probable migraine, followed 
by [CONTACT_303954] -type headaches, and cervicogenic headaches .25 It is also recognized that trauma to 
the head can result in worsening of a previous headache syndrome. We recently published an 
article that provides characterization of PTH in our cohort of  individuals enrolled into the TBI 
Model System with moderate to severe TBI.25 Our study revealed that of those reporting 
headache, 63% met criteria for migraine and probable migraine using primary headache 
classification criteria for this cohort of prospectively studied individuals . Tension type headache 
accounted for 21% and cervicogenic headache for only 10%. Consistent with the general 
headache literature, females were more likely to have migraine headache and to have reported 
migraine headache prior to injury. Those with migraine h eadache also reported higher frequency 
of headaches  compared to those with other headache types .  
 Virtually all early reports of PTH have relied  on populations with mild TBI and post -
concussion syndrome disorders. Many of the studies report on self -referr ed populations. Lew et 
al16 in [ADDRESS_371752] -traumatic headaches in a 15 yea r 
period (145 in total) and found only 5 articles reporting studies that addressed the characteristics 
and types of headaches, and 10 articles on the treatment of PTH ([ADDRESS_371753]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache

 series, 5 retrospective or uncontrolled prospective studie s). Pooled data from these [ADDRESS_371754] common occurring 
in 33.6% of headache sufferers. Migraines occurred in 28.6% of the headache patients. More 
recent examination of characterizatio n of PTH has come from studies conducted on military 
populations with similar results to our study.44, [ADDRESS_371755] that characterization of PTH is consistent with higher 
rates of migraine type headache, over tension or cervicogenic.32, 49 -52   
What is the current approach to treatment of PTH?: Currently, the literature on 
treatment of PTH suggests foll owing guidelines for treating headache using general population 
studies on those with primary headache disorders.46, 53-[ADDRESS_371756] used migraine -specific therapy for PTH based on anecdotal evidence of success. 
Erickson et al conducted a retrospective  review of PTH treatment in a clinic -based population of 
active duty soldiers, and found that the “triptans”, a class of migraine -specific medications, were 
effective in those suffering from moderate to severe PTH, both blast and non -blast related.[ADDRESS_371757]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371758] profiles from primary migraine treatment or whether the medication can be 
taken appropriately (for example, that is has greater efficacy when taken at headache onset) by  
[CONTACT_303955].  
Why triptans? P harmacological features of triptans and the concept of the 
physiological “common pathway” :  Migraine specific medications include the “triptans” which 
are serotonin 5 -HT 1B/1D agonists that work to inhibit inflammator y peptide release (e.g., 
calcitonin gene -related peptide, CGRP, a potent vasodilator) in the meninges through the 
serotonin 1D receptor. Blocking release decreases a “pain signal” being generated from 
peripheral trigeminal nerves to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis which is thought to modulate or 
generate migraine. Triptans also bind to receptors on the meningeal artery endothelium via 
serotonin 1B (5 -HT 1B) receptors causing vasoconstriction of vessels dilated by [CONTACT_303956].  
TWIST: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371759] been compared. It has proven efficacy and tolerability for 
the treatment of primary migraine. It comes in several oral doses (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg) and 
the [ADDRESS_371760] has a variety of headache types which 
include migraine  (mixed headache disorder) , then sumatriptan is effective for all headache 
phenotypes  in that subject as compared to treatment of those individuals with headache disorders 
that do not include migraine (primarily mild -moderate, non -disabling headache). In this group of 
only non-migraine headache, sumatr iptan is no more effective than placebo.57 This argues for a 
common underlying mechanism of di fferent headache “types” in those who having a moderate to 
severe headache which fits the definition of “migraine” or probable migraine despi[INVESTIGATOR_303926] (mixed headaches), all of which are responsive to 5 -HT 1B/1D 
agonist s. Given anecdotal response to the triptans in PTH described in one observational study 
by [CONTACT_303957]56 and potential physiologic similarities between primary headache disorders and 
PTH, resulting in similar headache phenotypes, there may be a final common path with  response 
to migraine medication in primary migraine and PTH which would provide clinicians with tools 
to effectively treat these headaches which have a significant impact on function following brain 
injury.  
TWIST: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371761] been reported.58 Both migraine and PTH show 
excessive release of excitatory amines such as glutamate and aspartate. Intracellular and total 
brain magnesium has been found to decline in mild TBI and is thought to be low during and 
between migraine attacks. There is a change in the calcium/magnesium ratio in both conditions 
and nitric oxide, while potentially l eading to tissue injury through free radical formation 
following TBI, is thought to be involved in migraine, as it is a potent vasodilator at the vascular 
endothelium.[ADDRESS_371762] of a “final common path.”[ADDRESS_371763] physical force from TBI can cause the biochemical changes 
discussed above also activating the trigeminovascular system and causing neurogenic 
inflammation and there fore, responding to treatment with a drug so far only approved to treat the 
moderate to severe headaches known as migraine.  
V.  Specific Aims of Study : The ultimate aim of this Phase II open -label study is to test the 
research m ethods and approach  necessary to successfully carry out a Phase III study for the 
treatment of post -traumatic headache (PTH).  During this study, we will  
1. Determine the feasibility of using a headache diary accessed via smart phone 
application,  the web, or paper/pencil to record accurat e headache data in a group of 
TWIST: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/21 
Page 14 
 individuals with  mild (with adequate documentation or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_303927]),  moderate and severe TBI, and their caregivers as indicated.  
2. Evaluate the approximate effect size of sumatriptan on pain severity, durat ion, and 
recurrence of headaches in persons with moderate to severe PTH in order to establish 
the necessary sample size for a Phase III study.  
3. Assess the side effect profile of sumatriptan in a brain -injured population as well as 
the safety of sumatriptan  in subjects with TBI.  
4. Evaluate the ability of persons with TBI, and their caregivers as indicated, to 
successfully use abortive headache medications and comply with treatment.  
5. Examine the relationship between PTH and cognitive, emotional, and other self -
report measures to determine important factors to include in a Phase III study.  
VI.  Overview of Study Design  
This phase II evaluation of sumatriptan as a treatment for PTH will examine the methods and 
approach necessary to take the next step to a phase III tri al. The sample will include 40 
individuals with mild (with adequate documentation or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_303928]), 
moderate and severe TBI who will be recruited  primarily  from patients within UWTBIMS  and 
from outpatient clinics and brain injury relat ed organizations  to be followed over [ADDRESS_371764] two and up 
to a maximum of fifteen moderate to severe headaches  per month. Severity will be rated using 
a 4 point pain scale (0=no headache, 1=mild headache, 2=moderate headache, 3=severe 
headache).  Headache classification will be confirmed by [CONTACT_303958].

  Population  
A. Inclusion criteria:  
A subject will be eligible for enrollment into this study if all of the following criteria are met:  
• Age 16-65. The h igher age limit is set to 6 5 to reduce likelihood of health issues which 
may be a contraindication to the use of sumatriptan  and to meet recommendations by [CONTACT_303959].62 
• Diagnosis of mild (with adequate documentation or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_303929]), 
moderate or severe TBI occurring at least 2 weeks  but not greater than 60 months  before 
enrollment. Two weeks  was chosen to include only those subjects who are having 
headache beyond their acute injury and 60 months was chosen  to ensure that the 
head ache may reasonably be connected to the TBI.   
• Subject has at least two and up to a maximum of fifteen total moderate to severe 
headache days per month . Subject report of meeting this criterion will result in the 
subject entering the first month of the stu dy. However, this frequency must be 
documented in headache diary to enter the treatment phase of the study.  
• Headaches are classified as moderate to severe (2 or 3 on the 4 point pain scale: 0=no 
headache, 1=mild headache, 2=moderate headache, 3=severe head ache). As above, 
headache severity must be documented in the month -long headache diary prior to entry 
into the treatment phase.  
• Subject obtains a score of [ADDRESS_371765]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/21 
Page 17 
 • Subject is able and willing to give written informed consent for participation in screening 
activities and to participate fully in the study if eligible . For those subjects who score 
below [ADDRESS_371766] be a caregiver willing to 
also be consented for participation in the study.  
• Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at 
enrollment, and agree to remain abstinent or use acceptable methods of birth control (i.e., 
hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap or 
sponge, condoms, or partner has had a vasectomy) . Sumatriptan has been assigned to 
pregnancy category C by [CONTACT_1622]. Animal studies have revealed evidence of dec reased 
fetal body weight, embryo lethality, and cervicothoracic vascular defects. There are no 
controlled data in human pregnancy and therefore, sumatriptan should only be given 
during pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk.  
B. Exclusion criteria:  
A subject will not be eligible  to participate in this study if any of the following criteria apply:  
• History of ischemic heart disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, silent 
ischemia, Prinzmetal’s angina/coronary vasospasm, ischemic bowel disease, or peripheral 
vascular disease) based on self -report or history of basilar or hemiplegic migraine.  
• Uncontrolled hypertension at initial visit (sitting systolic pressure > 140 mm Hg, diastolic 
pressure > 90 mm Hg).   
• Impaired renal or liver function by [CONTACT_9870].  
• Subject has taken an MAO inhibitor within [ADDRESS_371767]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/21 
Page 18 
 • Subject has hypersensitivity reactions or other intolerance to sumatriptan or any other 5 -
HT 1B/1D -receptor agonists.  
• If subjects have medication overuse headache in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] ( if using 
medication to treat acute headache on more than 15 days per month).  
• Inability to speak or read English which would limit ability to interact with examiners 
and complete headache diary and other questionnaires during this study.  
C.  Sample Size  
• This i s a single arm, unblinded study and is being undertaken to test necessary study 
instruments and procedures, establish feasibility and determine side effects in a 
population with moderate to severe TBI in preparation for a subsequent Phase III study. 
Theref ore, we are using forty subjects as a reasonable sample size to meet these aims.

 VII. Overview of Study Procedure s 
A. Recruitment  
Description of the recruitment process : Subjects enrolling in the UWTBIMS will be 
provided information regarding the study and ask ed for permission to call them post 
discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (and at least two weeks out from their injury) for screening. 
Additionally, subjects enrolled in the UWTBIMS over the [ADDRESS_371768] in study participation, then a pre -
screening survey for inclusion/exclusion criteria will be given . Also, subjects will be 
recruited from outs ide the TBI MS, including outpatient headache and TBI clinics, and be 
advertised through related organizations such as the  Washington Brain Injury Alliance.  
There will also be advertising on our own TBI MS website. Study information emails using 
study bro chure will be sent out to UW providers on a monthly basis to aid with recruitment.  
A provider may respond with the name [CONTACT_303984] a potential subject 
whom the provider has spoken to about the study and given verbal permission for the 
coordinator to contact [CONTACT_303960].  
 
Subjects will be en couraged to bring a family mem ber or caregiver with them to any 
screening or research appointments.  Participants who are under 18 will be required to bring a 
parent or guardian with them to their research appointments. As part of the process to 
evaluate participants’ ability to comply with the use of the headache diaries and study drug, 
these family mem bers/caregivers will be interviewed about the amount of assistance needed 
TWIST: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371769] and any discrepancies in subjects’ reports. In our prior study, while family 
member/caregivers were not able to give details of headache characteristics, we did find t hat 
they were able to report accurately the occurrence of headaches when compared to subjects’ 
reports.  
B.  Data Collection and Measures    
Data collection will occur at enrollment, and at each clinic visit.  Table 2  provides a summa ry 
of the measures that are  collected at each step in the study . Figure 3 outlines all activity over 
throughout the duration of the study.  A full description of each measure and the reason for 
its use follows the table. ( Table 2:  List of measures .)

Measures wer e chosen to best assess domains of interest for this project . Where 
applicable , measures were chosen that are part of the Common Data Elements for TBI 
recommended as a result of a scientific initiative led by [CONTACT_303961] 
(NINDS, NIDRR, VA, DCOE, and DVBIC) and the re sults of which were published in a special 
edition of Arch ives of Phys ical Medicine and  Rehabil itation  (2010 , Volume 91  (11)) and which 
have been recently updated for Rehabilitation of Moderate to Severe TBI (TBI Version 2.0 CDE 
Review Package, http://www. commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/TBI.aspx#tab=Data_Standards ).  
The purpose of using Common Data Elements is to allow comparisons between studies, ease 
scientific communication, and accelerate accumulat ion of scientific knowledge. Three  of the 
content experts involved in the CDE initiative s are investigators on the proposed study (Dikmen , 
Temkin  and Bell ). The headache questionnaire has been used in our prior natural history studies

E.  Rationale/Explanation for Measure Selection : 
Headache relief, frequency and severity are the most frequently used measures of medication 
efficacy in headach e research. The headache survey and HIT -6 will further characterize the 
headache syndrome and functional impacts of headache. The headache survey will gather 
information on several factors that will be used to comprehensively describe PTH and its 
treatment including International Classification o f Headache Disorders, 2nd edition (ICHD) 
criteria (type of headache by [CONTACT_303962], duration, severity, associated 
symptoms).76 This measure was developed by [CONTACT_303963] -site study on 
the natural history of headach e after TBI funded by [CONTACT_303964]5 program and a second single site field -initiated study funded by [CONTACT_303965].   
The Mini Mental State Examination63 will be administered at the screening visit.  Any 
score grea ter than or equal to 25 points (out of 30) indicates a sufficient cognitive level likely 
to enable a subject to participate without support. A lower score would indicate that the 
support of a caregiver would likely be necessary for successful adherence to the study 
protocol.  
The other cognitive measures (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning , Trail Making Test, 
WAIS IV Digit Symbol, and WAIS IV Symbol Search ) will be given at the clinic visit on 
Clinic  Visit [ADDRESS_371770] -TBI symptoms/severity and is used to 
measure other symptoms that may impact headache. Other measures were selected to capture

 the areas of functioning expected to be impacted by [CONTACT_303966] a function of 
treatment. The EuroQoL  and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) are intended to examine 
not only functional independence in various activities of everyday life, but also satisfaction 
with that quality of life. The PHQ -9, GAD -7, BPO, Analog Pain Scale and ISI measures will  
allow for evaluation of frequently co -occurring disorders (pain, sleep disorders, and 
depression) and broader response to the intervention.   
 A negative pregnancy test will be required for any female of child -bearing years.  
F.  Headache Diary:   As there are  no biomarkers for headache or headache severity, 
headache diaries are used to concurrently record the characteristics, frequency, and 
severity of headaches and the response to treatment and have been successfully used in a 
variety of populations, includin g children.[ADDRESS_371771] prior to discharge from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_303930]. [See Attachment 19 for headache 
diary  content ]

 VIII.   Enrollment and Visits  (See Table 2, Figure 3 ) 
Enrollment :  Subjects enrolling in the UWTBIMS will be provided information regarding the 
study and will be asked for  permission to call them post discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_303931].  Additionally, subjects enrolled in the UWTBIMS over the [ADDRESS_371772] in study participation, then a 
pre-screening survey for inclusion/exclusion criteria will be given . Additionally, subjects will 
be recruited from outside the TBI MS, including outpatient headache  and TBI clinics, and be 
advertised through related organizations such as the Brain Injury Alliance.   
 
Subjects will be encouraged to bring a family member or caregiver with them to any screening or 
research appointments.  Again, participants under 18 will  be required to bring a parent or 
guardian with them to their study visits.  As part of the process to evaluate participants’ ability to 
comply with the use of the headache diaries and study drug, these family members/caregivers 
will be interviewed about the amount of assistance needed by [CONTACT_303967]’ reports. In our prior study, while family member/caregivers were not able to give 
details of headache characteristics, we did find that they were able to report accurately the 
occurrence of headaches when compared to subjects’ reports.  
 
Description of  obtaining informed consent : Subject Informed Consent will be obtained after 
pre-screening and prior to any collection of any study data . Subjects will be emailed or given a 
copy of an ICF (Informed Consent Form) prior to their baseline  clinic visit. This will allow extra

Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371773] inator o r research assistant . Each page of the 
ICF will be reviewed with the subjects. For those subjects scoring <[ADDRESS_371774]’s study ID.  
 
Pre-treatment Visit (Visit 1): Subjects who complete in formed consent and meet the inclusion 
criteria (with no exclusion criteria ) will be asked to complete [ADDRESS_371775] in determining 
compliance and ability to complete this portion of the study, and ensure that the frequency of 
headaches is sufficient to include into study intervention  (See Attachment 9  Study Sequence 
Flow Sheet ). Res earch staff will meet with the subject (and caregiver)  to provide training on 
headache diary utilization and will contact [CONTACT_203720] a daily and/or weekly basis to answer 
questions and maximize accuracy and compliance with the diary , depending on the subject’s 
preference . Proper utilization of a headache diary and success of data input by [CONTACT_303968]. The

efficacy of drug treatment used. Howe ver for those who prefer , a computer accessed web-based 
headache diary  (otherwise similar to the iPod version) and a paper version with identical 
questions will be available . For those who choose the alternate forms of diary, a clip -on timer 
will be provid ed for recording of headache duration and reminders may be sent as text messages 
or emails based on subject preference.

Page 28 
 Treatment Visit ( Visit 2 ): 
Medical History and Physical Examination.  A medical history will be obtained  at the first visit  
to review inclusion and exclusion criteria and to elicit a thorough review of systems so that 
adverse events will be identifiable if they occur. Physical examination at the second visit will 
also ensure that cardiovascular status is compatible with sumatr iptan use and will document 
current status to allow for identification of potential adverse events. Finally, standard primary 
headache classification criteria will be reviewed with each patient to determine whether they 
meet criteria for  migraine or probab le migraine.  The headache diary will be reviewed before the 
treatment visit is scheduled, and patients who disqualify based on the classification of their 
headaches will not be scheduled to come in for Visit 2, as this would be an undue and 
unnecessary bur den given they will not be continuing with the study.  . 
 
Data Collection at Treatment V isit (Visit 2) : Headache histories will be assessed after 30 days 
(+/- 3 days), and subjects that have experienced between 4 -15 headaches will be included in the 
medicat ion intervention with sumatriptan.   Subjects who qualify for the sumatriptan intervention 
will receive several assessments, given medication, usage instructions, and schedule d for weekly 
phone calls for weeks 5 -11.  (See Table 2). Individuals whose headaches do not meet criteria for 
migraine or probable migraine , based on data from headache  diaries, will have their participation 
in the study end  and will not participate in Visit [ADDRESS_371777]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/21 
Page 29 
 Weekly Telephone Follow -Up Calls : Research staff will call each participant weekly to check 
on compliance with drug diary use during the first month of the study (Weekly calls 1 -3) to 
check on complianc e in diary usage.  For weekly calls in weeks 5 -11 (for the intervention 
participants), research staff will inquire about study drug usage, and query for adverse events.  
Use of rescue medications for headache will be recorded.  In the case of minor adverse  effects 
which are bothersome to the patient, the dosage will be decreased to a ½ pi[INVESTIGATOR_303932].   
 
Follow up Visit  (Visit 3) .  This will be the final visit for the subjec ts.  Vital signs will be 
obtained. Drug containers and headache diaries will be collec ted from all subjects.  Measures 
administered on this visit will include:  
1) Interim medical history form (new diagnoses, changes in medications)  
2) Headache Survey  
3) Headache Impact Test (HIT -6) – Questions about headaches and how much 
they affect patient’s life.  
4) Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)  – Questions about how satisfied patient is 
will life.  
5) Rivermead Post -Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ)  – Questions 
about the [ADDRESS_371778] common  symptoms after concussion.  
6) Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) – Questi ons about symptoms of 
depression.  
7) Brief Pain Overview  (BPO), Analog Pain Scale - Questions asking about pain.  
8) Insomnia Sleep Index (ISI)  – Questions about sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_285816].

Subject Instruction : During the  Visit 1 , research staff will explain headache diary  and 
demonstrate usage to ensure patient (and caregiver if present) understand.   Instruction s will 
include how and when to take the study medication .  Their pain will be assessed 2 hours 
following use of sumatriptan , this will include:  
1. pain presence  
2. severity  throughout the first [ADDRESS_371779]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/21 
Page 31 
 Written and verbal instructions  will be given on which drugs to avoid during the 
study, acceptable drugs to use for rescue therapy, and what to do in the case of an 
adverse event.   
IX. Treatment with Sumatriptan Procedures  
Use of sumatriptan and rescue drug:  Two packages of nine (9) sumatriptan 100 - mg. pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] 
(18 pi[INVESTIGATOR_303933] 2 months of treatment) will be dispensed to each sub ject on D ay [ADDRESS_371780] of appropriate medications will be provided that 
they can use if they: 1) continue to have headache pain 2 hours after their second dose of 
study drug , or 2) they have used their 30 day supply  of study drug within the month . All 
subjects will be contact[CONTACT_303969] a weekly basis to review their headache diaries, 
assess potential adverse events, review compliance with use of the study drug, assess  other 
treatments being utilized, and answer any questions. After 60 days, all subjects will be given 
an outcome assessment .  The measures included in this assessment are shown in Table 2 . 
Compliance : Compliance will be assessed during the weekly telephone  follow -up calls  to 
subjects and caregivers and we will have subjects return their medication packs and any unused 
medication at Visit [ADDRESS_371781]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371782]  and/or caregiver  in problem solving compliance issues , 
including suggesting to subjects that staff contact [CONTACT_303970], telephone or text with 
daily reminders to comp lete their headache entry.   
 
Medication administration :  The study drug will be distributed in blister packs.  Subjects will be 
instructed to decrease the dose by 50% (cut the tablet in half) if side effects occur after the first 
dose. They will also be req uired to contact [CONTACT_303971]. If the side 
effects continue to be intolerable, that subject will be discontinued from the intervention portion 
of the study but will be asked to continue keepi[INVESTIGATOR_303934] .     
 
Rationale for Dosage Selection and Medication Administration Procedures:  The 
recommended initial dosage of Sumatriptan  is [ADDRESS_371783] commonly 
prescribed dose in primary care as well as neurology or headache specialty clinics. In a meta -
analysis of 53 clinical trials involving sumatriptan,77 100 mg of Sumatriptan  resulted in  29% of 
patients becoming pain free at  2 hour s (moderate to severe pain to no pain) vs. placebo . This is a 
much more ri gorous end -point than the pain relief response which showed  a 59% headache relief 
response (moderate to severe to mild or no pain) vs. placebo . Rescue medications will include 
acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or other analgesic as prescribed by [CONTACT_423]’s own physician; 
detailed instructions will be provided to the subjects.  
A. Subject Discontinuation:   Subjects may be discontinued from the study drug by [CONTACT_303972]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371784] will be asked to continue to monitor their headaches with use of 
the headache diary and to participate in a final assessment .   
 
Compensation :  Subjects will be  given $25 upon completion of each  of the three  clinic 
visits (total $75). This compensation is to defray the cost of phone use, 
transportation/parking cost, and any meals and to compensate subjects for their time.   
Subjects will also have their parking co sts validated.  
 
X.  Data Analysis  
Study Sample Size and Rationale : This is a single arm, unblinded study and is being 
undertaken to test necessary study instruments and procedures, establish feasibility and 
determine side effects in a population with mild (with adequate documentation or in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_303935]) moderate , or severe TBI in preparation for a subsequent Phase III 
study. Therefore, we are using forty subjects as a reasonable sample size to meet these aims.   
 
Case Availability :  We an ticipate no difficulty in recruiting [ADDRESS_371785] 48% of TBIMS subjects to have headaches that 
qualify in terms of both frequency (4 to 15 headaches per month) and severity (rating of 2 or 
3 on the 4 point scale), (26% had qualifying headac hes at 3 months, another 10% who did not 
qualify at 3 months had qualifying headaches at 6 months and another 12% who had not 
qualified previously had qualifying headaches at 12 months). The UWTBIMS expects to 
TWIST: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371786] 3.5 years of the upcoming cycle 
(45*3.5=158 TBIMS participants) will be eligible for the headache study. Additionally, 
because eligible subjects can be between [ADDRESS_371787] in being contact[CONTACT_7678].  
 
Data Analysis : Data analysis for the feasibility and safety aims will be primarily descriptive. 
We will calculate the percent of subjects who  used the diary successfully, percent who 
stopped taking sumatriptan because of side effects, percent who experienced each adverse 
event, and percent who were able to maintain compliance with treatment. We will present a 
confidence interval for each estima te. To get preliminary data on efficacy of sumatriptan, we 
will compare headache control before and after the participants start taking sumatriptan. We 
will calculate the percent of headaches that had complete resolution (pain free at 2 hours) for 
each per son, during the initial (pre -intervention) month when they used their regular 
treatment and during the two months (intervention) when they treated headaches with 
sumatriptan and compare them using a paired t -test. We will also examine different 
definitions  of headache relief (pain free by 30 minutes, no more than mild pain (score <=1) 
by 30 minutes, no more than mild pain by 2 hours) to see if another outcome measure may 
have advantages for a future Phase III study. We will descriptively examine any differe nces 
in compliance, side effects, and feasibility based on cognitive functioning, as well as by [CONTACT_303973]-report and emotional health measures. Changes in these measures from pre to post

ensure only authorized personnel  can view or change them. Data will be uploaded to the 
Biostatistics Unit monthly.  Data are stored on a University of Washington secure server that 
is backed up nightly. More sophisticated checks than can be implemented at the time of entry 
will be run mon thly, generating queries for the staff to evaluate and correct if necessary. 
Neuropsychological tests will be double checked and double scored. Reports monitoring the 
progress of the study will be generated monthly to help the investigators identify areas such 
as enrollment or follow -up rates that might need specific attention.  Analyses will be 
performed using SPSS or SAS.

E. Sharing study results : As this will be an open -label study, each subject will be able to 
personally decide whether sumatriptan was helpful to them. We will offer to send a letter 
summarizing the study to the subjects’ primary health care pro vider to allow for further 
prescriptions if the subject desires. While the s tudy drug may be of ben efit to an 
individual subject, the main sharing of study results will be with the general public and 
medical community which may benefit from our study outco me. Further information on 
information sharing is contained in Section D, Plan of Dissemination Activities.  
F. Laboratory evaluations : This study will not collect any specimens nor do any laboratory 
evaluations other than a pregnancy test in female subjects a t randomization, and those 
results will be immediately communicated to the subjects.  
XII.  Plan of Evaluation  
The research team, under the direction of [CONTACT_139727] , has outlined a plan that provides for 
periodic evaluation of the progress towards study outcomes , quality of data collection and entry, 
and dissemination with clear assignment of responsibilities for these tasks.  Performance 
measures were chosen for their relevance in achieving the specific aims of the study and in 
assessing the impact on the stakeh olders for this study (including researchers, health care 
providers, and most importantly, consumers).   
 
TWIST: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache

Activities , (2) Post -Enrollment Activities, and (3) Data Analysis / Dissemination (See Table 4 
for complete listing of performance measures).  There will be substantial pre -enrollment 
activities that will be addressed including completion of the manual of procedures , obtaining full 
IRB approval, database construction and testing, research staff training, equipment certification, 
pharmacy set -up, and subject binder/headache diary application completion.  Post -enrollment 
activities include subject recruitment and reten tion, completion of all data collection, monitoring 
of data safety and data audit and clean -up.  Data analysis and dissemination will consist of 
primary and secondary reports (presentation and publications) from the study, and design and 
submission of a Ph ase 3 trial (if the results so indicate).  
 
XIV. Safety and Adverse Events  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_303936] a current medication list will be obtained for study 
physician review.  Daytime queries by [CONTACT_303977]. For 
nighttime or weekend queries, the subject will have access to a [ADDRESS_371794]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache

 a.  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others :  Any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
b. Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study -
related documents such as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the 
investigators brochure, etc)  
c. Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly 
related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or 
outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459])  
d. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).  
e. An adverse  event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent 
illnesses or injuries should be regarded as  adverse events.   Abnormal results 
of diagnostic procedures are considere d to be adverse events if the 
abnormality:  
•  results in study withdrawal  
•  is associated with a serious adverse event  
•  is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
•  leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
•  is considered by [CONTACT_303978] -serious.   
f.  Serious Adverse Event :  A serious adverse event is any AE  that is:   
TWIST: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/21 
Page 41 
 •  fatal  
•  life -threatening  
•  requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
•  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
•  a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
•  an important medical event  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life 
threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They  may 
jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a 
seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment 
of bronchospasm in  an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_60062].   All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious 
should be regarded as non- serious adverse events . 
g.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally 
defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the 
study treatment follow -up. For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined 
as [ADDRESS_371795]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371796] to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this 
study.  The investigator should notify the Data Safety Monitor of any death or 
adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated 
study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.     
j.  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if 
any one of the  following  conditions is met:  
•  The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm 
the abnormality . 
•  The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity . 
•  The abnormality is of a degree that requires act ive management; e.g. change of 
dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.

Page 43 
 Any adverse event that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_303938] a serious adverse event unless specifically 
instructed otherwise in this protocol. Any condition responsible for surgery 
should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria f or 
and adverse event.  
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported 
as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
1.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_303939] a preexisting condition.  
2. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose 
of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
B.  Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the study staff must seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].   Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and 
abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though 
should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be  recorded.  The clinical course 
of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
TWIST: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371797] be followed up to determine the final 
outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be 
possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported 
immediately . 
Minimum information required for each AE includes type of event, duration (start and end 
dates), severity, seriousness, causality to study, action taken, and outcome.  
 
C.  Evaluating Adverse Events  
Assessment should include the intensity (severity) of the event and the relationship to Study  
Agent(s)/Intervention(s).  
Severity of AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_63031]:  
1. Mild: Nuisance, barely noticeable.  
2. Moderate: Uncomfortable, troublesome symptoms not significantly interfering with 
daily activities or sleep.  
3. Severe: Symptoms significantly interfere with daily activities or sleep.  
The relationship of the AE to the study drug should be specified by [CONTACT_737], using 
the following definitions:  
• Not Related : Concomi tant illness, accident or event with no reasonable association with 
treatment.  
• Unlikely : The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration of the study 
drug, and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
TWIST: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/21 
Page 45 
 • Possibly Related : The reaction  follows a reasonably temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug;  
the reaction could have been produced by [CONTACT_303979]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_303980].  
• Probably Related : The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of study drug; is confirmed by [CONTACT_303981] -
challenge; and cannot be reasonably explai ned by [CONTACT_78456]’s clinical state.  
• Definitely Related : The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of study medication; that follows a known or expected response pattern to 
the study medication; an d that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_303940], and reappearance of the reaction on repeated  exposure.  
D.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
1.  Investigator Obligations  
Investigators must conform to the adverse event reporting timelines, formats and 
requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible, but at a minimum 
those events that must be promptly reported are those that are:  
•  serious and related to study particip ation;  
•  serious and unexpected; and  
•  any other unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others

will give their written consent to participate in the study .  Subjects will be provided information 
about the purpose of the study, participation/termination  conditions, risks, and potential benefits.   
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in 
the study and continuing throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of 
risks and po ssible benefits of this therapy will be provided to the participants and their families. 
Consent forms describing in detail the Study Agent(s)/Intervention(s) study procedures and risks 
are given to the participant and written documentation of informed con sent is required prior to 
starting study agent/intervention. Consent forms will be IRB approved and the participant will be 
asked to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the document, the investigator will 
explain the research study to the particip ant and answer any questions that may arise.  The 
participants will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done 
specifically for the study.   The participants should have sufficient opportunity to discuss the 
study and process the  information in the consent process prior to agreeing to participate.  The

 XVI.  Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Possible risk:  
• Some people may experience side effects to sumatriptan including sensations such as 
chest tightness, tingling, muscle tightness.  These are usually mild and transient, and 
rarely require urgent care.   
• Although rare, some people may experience  allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to 
sumatriptan  and may need to contact a physician .  
• Excessive use of sumatriptan can cause overuse hea daches.   
• Sumatriptan is contraindicated in pregnant women and people with ischemic cardiac, 
cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease because of its vasoconstrictive effects 
mediated by [CONTACT_303982] 5HT -[ADDRESS_371802] subclinical disease.  
• Subjects may be asked personal questions regarding such topi[INVESTIGATOR_303945], and may be asked whether they have thoughts of death or suicide. This may 
cause some emotional discomfort.  
• There is a risk that this private information about them m ay be disclosed.  
• Unexpected detection of a potential diagnosis such as major depression may carry with it 
the risk of emotional distress.  
 Risk management and emergency response:  
A study or on -call physician will be available 24/[ADDRESS_371803]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371804] the patient to continue or to stop taking the 
study drug. If th e reaction is sufficien tly severe , the research coordinator  will be notified  and the 
patie nt will be discontinued from taking further  study medication.   
 
Subjects will be given 2 packages of 9 tablets of  study drug at Day 30, each package to be 
opened at t he start of that month. This  amount is not expected to cause medication overuse  
(rebound)  headaches. Subjects will be instructed not to take non -study  sumatriptan, or any other 
triptan, for headache or any other reason while on study medication.  A list of alternative 
medications will be provided to take if needed for rescue.  Potential subjects will be excluded if 
they are on medication which has a high clinical probability of drug interaction. Subjects will be 
provided with  a list of drugs they s hould not take during the study.  
 
All serious adverse events will be sent to [CONTACT_303987], the safety monitor , within [ADDRESS_371805]: Treatment With Sumatriptan for TBI Headache  
 
Version 6 .1 
Rev. 12/22/[ADDRESS_371806] the confidentiality of their personal  information, 
including but not limited to dissociating identifying information from  research data; using unique 
alpha -number coding systems that permit linkages to  identifying data only via files that are 
stored separately; storage of data on password protected servers or computers; storage of paper 
data forms in locked files within locked  rooms with access limited to approved research staff; 
storage of audiotapes on a secure server with highly restricted password access and periodic 
download to permanent storage in locked facilities. All investigators and research staff are 
required to und ergo HIPAA training and to sign a confidentiality agreement under the authority 
of the Human Subjects Division of the University of Washington.  
 
When a diagnosable condition such as major depression is detected, we will assess for  potential 
suicidality. If  the patient does not indicate current suicidal ideation, we will discuss immediately 
with the psychologist ([CONTACT_139727]) or physician (Drs. Bell and Lucas) and an appropriate 
referral will be made. In the case of suicidality, we will use suicide managemen t protocols that 
have are approved by [CONTACT_303983], use of local Crisis Clinic numbers and 24/[ADDRESS_371807] 
more comprehensive assessments and ma ke referrals as  needed.  ( See Appendix for Emergent 
Problem Protocol ). 
Potential benefit of the study: Study participants may benefit from improvement in headache 
pain, associated symptoms and a decrease in disability following the use of study drug. Weekly 
telephone cal ls and the utilization of a headache diary may provide greater insight into their 
headaches . Potential s ocietal benefits include decreased work loss and increased productivity,

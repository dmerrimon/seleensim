Study Design and Schedule:  
This is a global , multi -center, randomized, placebo -controlled study  to evaluate adverse 
events of special interest in adults with active, autoantibody -positive systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE)  treated with belimumab  plus standard therapy vs placebo plus 
standard therapy . It was initially planned that a pproximately 5, [ADDRESS_633043] s would be 
randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups:  belimumab 10 mg/kg (2,500 subjects) or placebo 
(2,500 subjects ) plus standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . Subseqent to the completion of 2 additional 
placebo -controlled trials, it was estimated based on data from all 5 of the completed Phase 
2/[ADDRESS_633044] s will receive study agent (belimumab or placebo) on Days 0, 14, 28 and 
approximately every 28 days thereafter through Week 48 with a final visit conducted  at 
Week 52. Subjects who discontinue treatment at any time during the 52-week study will 
be followed  for mortality and malignancy  including  non-melanoma skin cancers ( NMSC)  
at 1 year (through Week 52)  and annually for Years [ADDRESS_633045] , selected serious 
psychiatric events, suicidality , and serious infusion and hypersensitivity reactions . All 
cause mortality will be reported. All other serious adverse events (SAEs), irre spective of 
causality,  will also be recorded. Medical history  will be collected on all subject s. 
Immunomodulatory agent s used to treat SLE at baseline and during study, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
and organ damage (SLICC /ACR  Damage Index) will also be assessed through Week 52.  
All subjects  will have a follow -up visit performed  approximately  [ADDRESS_633046] at Week 52  and annually for Years 2 through 5 (Week 
260) to assess mortality and  malignancy (including NMSC) .

[ADDRESS_633047] s may continue to receive their other SLE medications including cortico steroids, 
immunomodulatory agents  and antimalarials; c hanges in these SLE medications during the 
trial will be permitted as clinically indicated. No concomitant biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_492241] 52-week study . In the event that the treating physician decides that a 
subject r equires the addition of a biologic  agent  before Week [ADDRESS_633048] is withdrawn 
from study agent treatment , but is followed on the study through Week 52  and annually for 
Years 2 through 5 (Week 260) .  
Following the 52-week study, all subjects will be con tacted annually through Year 5 (Week 
260) to assess mortality and  malignancy ( including NMSC).  
At the end of the 52-week study , subjects who wish to continue treatment may be able to 
do so by [CONTACT_492287]. If belimumab is not 
commercially available in a subject’s country of participation, the subject may be able to 
receive belimumab under a separate continuation protocol. A separate informed consent 
will need to be provided for the continuation protocol.  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC) will review unblinded safety data 
for this study on an ongoing basis until the data are locked and analyzed. The IDMC will 
include at least [ADDRESS_633049]. 
After the initial review, the IDMC will continue to review the data approximately every 6 
months. Events to be monitored during the safety review will include at a minimum all 
serious adverse events (including deaths, serious psychiatric events and serious infections), 
opportunistic infections (serious and nonserious)  and other infections of int erest , 
malignancies  (including NMSC) , and serious infusion and hypersensitivity reactions . 
Investigators and IRBs/IECs will be notified of the outcome of each IDMC meeting.  
Endpoint s and Statistical Analysis : 
The main purpose of this study is to provide an evaluation of the difference in the rates of 
all prespecified AESI and all cause  mortality between the belimumab and the placebo  
groups  with a 2-sided 95% confidence interval ( CI). SAEs will be analyzed descriptively 
only.

 Safety Endpoints : 
The table below describes the safety endpoints and measures collected in the study .  
All-cause mortality  
Serious Infections (including serious opportunistic infections and any event of TB or TB reactivation)  
Non-serious opportunistic infections and other infections of interest (Appendix 2 ) 
Malignancies ( excluding NMSC)  
Non-melanoma skin cancers  
Psychiatric events suggesting serious mood disorders and anxiety  
Suicidality (using C -SSRS; Appendix 4  and Appendix 5 ) 
Serious Infusion and Hypersensitivity Reactions  
All SAEs  
 
Efficacy Endpoints : 
The major efficacy endpoint is: 
• Percent of subjects whose average prednisone (or equivalent) dose has been reduced 
by ≥ 25% from baseline to ≤ 7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52  (in the subgroup 
of subjects receiving > 7.5 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) at baseline).  
 
Other efficacy endpoints include:  
• Use of immunomodulatory medications to treat SLE  over 1 year . 
• Number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492242] .  
• Percent of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] . 
 
SLICC /ACR  Damage Index will be recorded at baseline and at Week 52 to allow  
assessment of accrual of damage in subjects who may be  followed in a subsequent study.  
Sample Size  Considerations : 
The sample size is based on the feasibility of enrolling a large number of SLE subjects in 
a global trial that will provide a reasonable estimate for mortality and other AESI rates. 
Originally, the sample size was approximated at 5,[ADDRESS_633050] s to be rando mized  (1:1 
randomization; 2,500 per treatment group) to thereby [CONTACT_492288] - and placebo -treated groups to be established with a 95% CI 
of  0.46% (see Section 8.4 of the protocol) .  
Following completion of two additional placebo -controlled trials  (each comprising 1 year 
of treatment) , a revised mortality estimate based on data from all 5 of the completed 2/3 
trials enabled the same level of precision (i.e., a 95% CI of  0.46%) for the difference in 
mortality between placebo and belimumab to be achieved with 4,000 subjects. 
2016N273856_02  CONFIDENTIAL  
GlaxoSmithKline group of companies   HGS1006 -C1113 (BEL115467)  
9 
 Consequently, a proposal to reduce the sample size from 5,000 to 4,000 subjects was 
accepted  by [CONTACT_12721].  
The randomization will be stratified for  region (US/Canada vs Central America/South 
America/Mexico vs Europe/Australia/Israel vs Asia), SELENA SLEDAI score ( ≤ 9 vs ≥ 
10), and steroid dose ( ≤7.5 mg/day vs >7.5 mg/day prednisone o r equivalent).  
Safety Analysis:  
Mortality and AESI will be summarized descriptively using number and percentage of 
subjects and will be analyzed using an estimation paradigm . The difference in the rates of 
all prespecified AESI  and all cause  mortality, between the belimumab and the placebo  
groups  will be evaluated  with a 2-sided 95% CI. SAEs will be analyzed descriptively only. 
Deaths will also be described in detail, including, in the belimumab group, assessment of 
relationship to belimumab treatment. The frequency and rate of serious adverse events will 
be tabulated by [CONTACT_11189] (SOC) and preferred term . The SAE rates 
may also be reported adjusted for subject years.   
For all cause mortality, the hazard ratio (and its 95% CI) for belimum ab vs placebo will be 
estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted for baseline randomization 
factors. The time to death will be censored at the last follow -up by [CONTACT_492289].  
Safety analyses will be perf ormed using the As -Treated  population, defined as all 
randomized subjects who receive a dose of study agent , grouped according to the actual 
treatment administered to the subject for more than 50% of the doses .  
Analysis of Major Efficacy Endpoin t: 
The percent of subjects with average prednisone (or equivalent) dose that has been reduced 
by ≥ 25% from baseline to ≤ 7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52 will be compared 
between the belimumab and the placebo groups using a logistic regression model, ad justed 
for baseline prednisone (or equivalent) dose level, baseline SELENA SLEDAI score ( ≤ 9 
vs ≥ 10), and region (US/Canada or Central America/South America/Mexico or 
Europe/Australia/Israel or Asia). The analysis will be performed on subjects who were 
using prednisone (or equivalent) at a dose > 7.5 mg/day at baseline  and were in the intent -
to-treat (ITT) population . In the analysis, all subjects who drop out and/or add new 
immunosuppressive agents before the Week 52 visit will be considered having no ste roid 
reduction. However, switching immunomodulatory  agents for toxicity reasons or lack of 
availability (eg, no longer manufactured or no longer reimbursed) is permitted and will not 
be imputed as no steroid reduction. To examine the robustness of the resu lts, a sensitivity 
analysis of the steroid reduction may be performed without considering any information 
related to the use of new immunomodulatory agents.

 1 Background  
1.1 Disease Background  Releva nt to Clinical Study  
SLE is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that primarily affects young women of 
childbearing age, although men, children and teenagers also can develop lupus. SLE is 
characterized by [CONTACT_492290] B cells resultin g in elevated levels of 
autoantibodies, which directly damage the body’s cells and tissues or form immune 
complexes which cause inflammation and tissue damage. A range of organ systems may 
be involved simultaneously or sequentially. The manifestations of l upus include arthritis, 
pleuritis, pericarditis, stroke, seizure, nephritis, vasculitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
alopecia, photosensitivity, and malar rash. Over time, patients with lupus accrue 
irreversible organ damage which contributes to an increased  mortality rate in these patients. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_492243] [ADDRESS_633058] often develops between the ages of 15 – 44 with an insidious onset 
(Danchenko  et al, 2006 ). In the US, the estimated average of the reported prevalence is 
approximately 10  cases per 10,000 persons, representing about 300,000 patients, and the 
incidence has increased 2.5 -fold between 1950 and 1979 ( Uramoto  et al, 1999 ; Somers  et 
al, 2007;  Balluz  et al, 2001 ; Naleway  et al, 2005 ; Ward , 2004 ; Helmick  et al, 2008 ). In the 
European Union, an estimated overall average of the reported prevalenc e is 4 to 5 cases 
per 10,000 persons ( Alamanos  et al, 2003 ; Benucci  et al, 2005 ; Eilertsen  et al, 2006 ;

2004 ; Samanta  et al, 1992 ; Stahl -Hallengren  et al, 2000 ; Voss  et al, 1998 ). Re cent studies 
by [CONTACT_492291], have emphasized the increased risk of mortality in SLE and have 
provided data comparing all cause and disease -specific relative mortality across groups 
characterized by [CONTACT_654], sex, SLE duration, calendar -year period, geograph ic location, and 
race ( Bernatsky  et al, 2006 ). A 2.4 -fold greater risk of mortality (95% CI 2.3 –2.5) was 
identified in SLE compared with the general population and th ere was an increased risk of 
death due to cardiovascular causes, malignancy, infections, and renal disease.  
In an attempt to answer the question as to whether patients with SLE have an increased risk 
of malignancy in comparison to the general population, several large studies have  recently 
been conducted. In a  Swedish cohort of patients with SLE, Bjornadal  et al (2002)  used 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492245] 25% higher than the general population. Of note, this finding was driven 
primarily by [CONTACT_492292] -Hodgkin ’s lymphoma (NHL) in the SLE 
population which had a relative risk that was 2.86 -fold higher (95% CI 1.96, 4.04) than 
that of the general population. These findings have been subsequently confirmed by [CONTACT_492293] (SLICC) research group in a larger 
international mu lti-center cohort study. Using standardized incidence r atio (SIR) estimates, 
a small increase in all malignancies combined was observed (SIR, 1.15 , 95% CI 1.05, 1.27) 
for SLE compared to that expected for the general population based on data from regional 
cancer registry li nkages (Bernatsky  et al, 2005 ). Similarly, the increased risk for NHL was 
also demonstrated (SIR, 3.64, 95% CI 2.63, 4.93) in the SLE population compared with 
the gene ral population. Unfortunately, no investigations have been able to establish the 
reason for the close association between SLE and malignancy. Potenti al considerations for

GlaxoSmithKline group of companies   HGS1006 -C1113 (BEL115467)  
[ADDRESS_633059] r atio (HR) for overall risk of 
malignancy after administration of any immunosuppressive drug was 0.82 (95% CI 0.50 
1.36). However, when specifically considering hematological malignancies, there was a 
suggestion of an increased risk after immunosuppressive drug exposures particularly when 
the medication exposures were lagged by a period of 5 years (adjusted HR 2.29, 95%  CI 
1.02-5.15).  
Infections are responsible for morbidity and mortality in 25 -50% of SLE patients; they are 
an important cause of death in SLE patients in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696] ( Alarcón  et al, 2001 ; 
Cervera  et al, 1999 ; Graciela  et al, 2006 ). In a multi -center European study in which 1,[ADDRESS_633060] 
higher rates of infections and poorer outc omes compared to the general population ( Doria  
et al, 2008 ; Petri , 1998 ). The microorganisms responsible for the overwhelming majority 
of infections in patients with SLE are bacteria with gram negative and gram positive being 
the most common. However, there are many reports of infections occurring in patients with 
SLE with various outcomes as a co nsequence of other microorganisms. The increased 
susceptibility to infections may be multifactorial. Disease activity has been shown to be an 
independent risk factor for the occurrence of infections ( Petri  et al, 1992 ; Zonana -Nacach  
et al, 2001 ) presumably because of the abnormal cellular function and complement 
abnormalities that ar e more pronounced in the affected patients. The use of corticosteroids 
and other immunosuppressive medications has also been associated with the increased 
occurrence of infections in SLE ( Gladman  et al, 2002 ; Noel  et al, 2001 ; Petri  et al, 1992 ). 
Consequently, the p ossibility exists that the increased occurrence of infections may be a 
consequence of cytokine suppression, resulting in multiple cellular functional 
abnormalities ( Boumpas  et al, 1993 ).  
Neuropsychiatric events are well recognized in the SLE population, with a wide range of 
incidence. In an international inception cohort study (Hanly , 2007 ), neuropsychiatric 
events occurred in 28% of subjects near the time of SLE diagnosis, and the incidence of 
mood disorders attributed to SLE ranged from 4% to 13% depending on the attribution 
model used. Another study (Bachen  et al, 2009 ) found the prevalence rates of many 
psychiatric disorders (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, etc.) 
were significantly higher in patients with SLE than the general po pulation. The rate of 
major depression reported in the literature for patients with SLE ranges from 22.5% -39.1% 
(Nery  et al, 2007 ; Brey  et al, 2002 ; Ainiala  et al, 2001 ). Severe depression requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492246] 0.26% (14/5371 SLE patients in a Swedish cohort followed 
from 1973 to 2004) ( Sundquist  et al, 2008 ). Chronic physical illness is also an important 
risk factor for suicide (Karassa  et al, 2003 ). Patients with SLE are at almost 5 times greater 
risk for suic ide than expected (Harris  et al, 1994 ). Suicide attempts among SLE patients 
was 5/300 SLE patients who visited a [LOCATION_006] Rheumatology Clinic over a 20 -year period 
(1979 -1999) ( Karassa  et al, 2003 ) with deaths attributed to suicide ranging from 0.23 -
0.95% ( Mok  et al, 2008 ; Nossent , 2001 ; Karassa  et al, 2003 ).

 1.2 Study A gent Background  Relevant to Clinical Study  
Belimumab (BENLYSTATM) is a recombinant human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody that 
binds to soluble human B -lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS; also known as B cell activating 
factor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family [BAFF] and TNFSF13 B) and 
inhibits its biological activity ( Baker , 2003 ). GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) received its first 
approval of belimumab on 09 March 2011 in [LOCATION_002] (US) for treatment of SLE at a 
dosage regimen of 10 mg/kg at [ADDRESS_633061] 3 doses and at 4 -week intervals 
thereafter. Belimumab is currently approved in the US, all EU Member States, as well as 
40 further countries.  These approvals were based on the data from two Phase 3 trials in 
1,684 patients where belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy demonstrated superiority 
over placebo plus standard therapy in reduction in disease activity as measured by [CONTACT_492294] (SRI) with an acceptable safety profile. Reduction in steroid use and risk 
of severe flare  was also observed, but not consistently across trials . Reductions in anti -
dsDNA antibodies and increases in complemen t levels were observed.  
The current primary belimumab safety population , include s safety da ta from the doubl e-
blind portion of the Phase 2/3 studies submitted with the original IV marketing application, 
as well as double -blind studies of beliumumab administered subcutaneously (SC) in SLE 
subjects and IV in SLE subjects located in the North East region of Asia . A summary of 
adverse events of special interest , including deaths,  in this dataset is provided below . 
Additional information is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Deaths from belimumab SLE studies are summarized in Table  1-1; this includes a 3 study 
pooled IV dataset  (data presented in the original marketing authorization submissions), and 
more recent data generated from studies pe rformed with IV belimumab in North East Asia 
(BEL113750) and from a study in which belimumab was administered SC  (BEL112341). 
A total of [ADDRESS_633062]  occurred in th is primary safety population : 6/1190 (0.504%) 
received  placebo,  and 14/2484 (0.564%) received  belimumab . No single cause of death has 
predominated and etiologies included infection, cardiovascular disease and suicide.

Malignancies (excluding NMSC) assessed across all IV and SC SLE belimumab studies as 
of 08 March 2016 , including safety data from double -blind and open -label studies/portions 
of studies and adjusted for patient -years exposure were compared with the maligna ncy rate 
in SLE patients reported in a large international cohort study of cancer in SLE  (Bernatsky  
et al, 2005). Excluding NMSC, the malignancy rate p er 100 patient -years with belimumab 
is 0.45 (95% CI 0. 33, 0.59) compared with a background rate in SLE patients of 0.53 (95% 
CI 0.48, 0.59). Excluding NMSC is appropriate given that they are generally nonserious 
events with a high cure rate and it is known  that NMSC is underreported in observational 
studies compared with prospective clinical trials ( Great Britain  National Cancer Statistics, 
2010; Young  et al, 2007). No pattern of malignancies or increase in a ny particular type of 
malignancy was identified in patients receiving belimumab other than would be expected 
in an SLE population with a predominance of women.  
In the randomized -controlled IV SLE trials, infections occurred slightly more often in 
belimumab  groups compared with the placebo group;  although , severe and serious events 
occurred at similar rates across the placebo and the belimumab groups. In the randomized -
controlled SC SLE study, similar rates of infections, including severe and serious events,  
occurred in the belimumab [ADDRESS_633063] -marketing approval patients 
appears less than the range reported in the literature for patients with SLE, 1.1 0 per 100 
patient -years (95% CI: 0.67, 1.7) as compared to 2.50 per 100 patient years (95% CI: 1.21, 
4.55) ( Gladman , 2002; Zonana -Nacach , 2001).  
 
Across all SLE studies of belimumab through [ADDRESS_633064]-years (95% 
CI: 9.83, 92.38). The incidence rate of suicidal behavior (suicide attempt and completed 
suicide) was [ADDRESS_633065] -years (95% CI: 110.20, 278.62). The incidence rate 
of suicidal ideation was [ADDRESS_633066] -years (95% CI: 55.93, 189.08). These

 estimates are consistent with the background rates for completed suicide (10 to 2181 per 
100,000 patient -years ( Cervera , 2003; Li-Yu, 2007) and for suicide and suicide attempts 
(117 per 100,000 patient -years; 95% CI: 46.9, 240) reported for SLE patients in 
observational studies or retrospective chart reviews ( Karassa , 2003). Furthermore, review 
of clinical trial, as well as postmarketing data, of suicide and suicidal thoughts and/or 
behavior did not identify a pattern or establis h an association with belimumab. It is known 
that SLE is associated with increased incidence of depression and suicide/suicidal ideation 
than in the general population.   
 
Across all SLE studies of belimumab through 08 March 2016, the proportion of subjects  
with serious hypersensitivity reactions or infusion/injection -related  reactions was 31/5366 
subjects (0.58%) or 0.[ADDRESS_633067] -years (95% CI: 0.19, 0.40). The estimated 
incidence rate of serious hypersensitivity reactions or infusion/injection -related reactions 
in spontaneous and postmarketing reports was 0.32 per 100 patient -years (95% CI: 0.26, 
0.38). The majority of serious hypersensitivity events have occurred on the 1st infusion, 
although there have been reports of hypersensitivity events occur ring after several 
infusions of belimumab. Most clinical trial and spontaneous cases of serious 
hypersensitivity occurred during or within the first hour after the completion of the 
infusion. The majority of reports of infusion -related and hypersensitivity  reactions were 
non-serious and included symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, fever, rash, 
urticaria, pruritus, headache, dizziness, and dyspnoea.  However, infusion and 
hypersensitivity reactions can be severe and fatal.

addition to the disease itself, t hese treatments  also cause short - and long -term morbidity. 
Agents such as cyclophosphamide are both cytotoxic and immunosuppressive and can 
result in increased risk of premature ovarian failure, se rious infection, and cancer. 
Long -term use of high -dose corticosteroids can cause cataracts, osteoporosis, avascular 
necrosis, metabolic disorders, increased infections, edema, weight gain, and 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  Belimumab is approved in numerous markets worl d wide and  is a BLyS -
specific inhibitor that blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B -cell survival factor, to its 
receptors on B  cells. B elimumab  does not bind B cells directly, but by [CONTACT_53165], 
belimumab  inhibits the survival of B cells, including aut oreactive B  cells, and reduces the 
differentiation of B  cells into immunoglobulin -producing plasma cells.  
In Phase 3 clinical trials belimumab was shown to be effective in the treatment of patients 
with active, autoantibody -positive SLE; patients with severe active lupus nephritis and 
severe active central nervous system lupus were excluded from the studies, as were patients 
receiving intravenous cyclophosphamide and other biologics. Furthermore, belimumab 
was generally safe and well -tolerated, includin g with long term use in a subset of patients, 
albeit in an uncontrolled setting.  While substantial information exists about the safety of

 belimumab from these clinical trials, the present study is intended to evaluate a larger 
number of subjects in a contr olled setting.  The safety objectives of the study are intended 
to focus on areas where a numerical imbalance in the frequency and rates w ere observed 
across treatment groups in the controlled trials included with the original marketing 
applications  (i.e., mortality, selected psychiatric events/suicidality , serious infusion and 
hypersensitivity reactions ) or where there is a theoretical basis for increased risk with an 
immuno modulatory treatment (ie,  serious/opportunistic infections, malignancy).   
The study design is considered optimal to address these safety objectives.  The study is 
doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled for [ADDRESS_633069] therapy. The 
benefit/risk profile of belimumab for SLE remains favorable.  
Identified risks include hypersensitivity/infusion reactions and infections. Potential risks 
(i.e., based on pharmacology but no association identified to date) include progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); malignancies; immunogenicity; effects on 
immunizations (including interactions with live vaccine); and psychiatric events including 
depression and suicidality.  
The most common AEs reported in the primary safety population of adults with SLE were 
associated with hypersensitivity/infusion related reactions, infections, and symptoms 
consistent with SLE.  The majority of reports of infusion -related and hypersensitivity 
reactions were non -serious and include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
chills, fever, rash, urticaria, pruritus, headache, dizziness, and dyspnoea.  However, 
infusion and hypersensitivity reactions can be severe and fatal.  Most clinical trial and 
spontaneous cases of serious hypersensitivity occurred during or within the first hour after 
the completion of the infusion, although some cases report delayed acute onset (>4 hours 
but <4 days) or a delayed non -acute onset (4-21 days) hypersensitivity reactions.   
Infections have been reported with administration of belimumab and are also associated 
with both SLE and immunosuppressant medication used to treat SLE. The mechanism of 
action of belimumab may increase the potenti al risk for the development of infections.

Hypersensitivity  Administration of IV belimumab may result 
in infusion and hypersensitivity reactions, 
which can be severe and can be fatal. Non -
serious infusion reactions and 
hypersensitivity reactions are common in 
SLE clinical trials with IV belimumab. 
Serious infusion and hypersensitivity 
reactions affected less than 1% of patients 
and included anaphylactic reaction , 
bradycardia, hypotension, angioedema, 
and dyspnea. Delays in the onset of 
hypersensitivity reactions have been 
observed. Infusion reactions following 
administration of belimumab occurred more 
frequently on the first [ADDRESS_633072] 2 infusions. Should symptoms of acute 
hypersensitivity occur, an extended period of 
monitoring may be appropriate, based on 
clinical judgment. Otherwise , subjects will be 
monitored during and after each infusion 
according to study sites’ guidelines or

thy (PML)  No association between belimumab and the 
risk of opportunistic infections, including 
PML, has been indentified to date, but data 
are limited. PML resulting in neurological 
deficits, including fatal cases, has been 
reported in SLE patients receiving 
immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy, 
including belimumab.  This potential risk does not directly 
impact eligibility criteria.  Subjects should be made aware of this 
potential risk, the signs and symptoms of PML, 
and the importance of immediately seeking 
medical attention.  A diagnosis of PML should 
be considered in any subject presenting with 
new-onset or deteriorating neurological  signs 
and symptoms. The subject should be referred 
to a neurologist or other appropriate specialist 
for evaluation. If PML is confirmed, study 
agent should be discontinued and 
consideration should be given to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_53117]. If PML is 
suspected, this should be immediately 
reported to the Medical Monitor.  The 
appropriateness of continuing study agent, 
while the case is being assessed, should be

any related signs or symptoms .  
Immunogenicity  As with other monoclonal antibodies, 
treatment with belimumab could lead to the 
development of anti -drug antibodies (ADA). 
Among SLE subjects treated with 
belimumab, the proportion of subjects who 
developed persistently positive ADA was 
low and very few of  the persistently positive 
antibodies were found to be neutralizing. 
Neither development of ADA nor persistent 
ADA was associated with infusion or 
hypersensitivity reactions. As expected, the 
proportions of subjects with persistent ADA 
increased slightly o ver time in belimumab -
treated subjects but there was no increase 
in the number of subjects with neutralizing 
antibodies or the number reporting infusion -
related adverse events.  This potential risk does not directly 
impact eligibility criteria.  Monitor adverse events.  
Effects on 
immunizations 
including reactions 
with live vaccines  No data are available on the secondary 
transmission of infection from persons 
receiving live vaccines to patients receiving 
belimumab. Because of its mechanism of 
action, belimumab may interfere with  the 
response to immunisations.  
However, in a study evaluating the 
response to a [ADDRESS_633075] of belimumab on

different serotypes were similar in SLE 
patients receiving belimumab compar ed 
with those not receiving treatment at the 
time of vaccination. L imited data suggest 
that belimumab does not significantly affect 
the ability to maintain a protective immune 
response to immunisations received prior to 
administration of belimumab.  
Potential 
psychiatric events 
- Depression and 
suicidality  There have been reports of depression and 
suicidality in patients receiving belimumab.  
The estimated rates of suicidality for  
belimumab remain consistent with the rates 
of the background SLE population.  The 
background rate for completed suicide 
identified in the literature ranged from 0.0 1 
to 2.1 7 per 100 PY and varied by [CONTACT_492295] 
(clinical trial or observational study) [ Li-Yu 
2007; Cervera  2003 ]. The background rate 
for suicidal behavior (completed suicide and 
attempts) is 0.12 (95% CI 0.05, 0.24)/100 
patient years [ Karassa  2003].  This potential risk does not directly 
impact eligibility criteria.   Perform suicidality assessment by [CONTACT_492296] -Severity Rating Scale (C-

 Refer to Section 8.3 for information about the I ndependent Data Monitoring Committee 
(IDMC)  being used in the study . 
1.4.2  Benefit Assessment  
The primary data supporting efficacy and the approval  of IV belimumab were t he Phase 3 trials 
(C1056 and C1057) in which 1,684 subjects were treated for up to 52 weeks (C1057) or 76 
weeks (C1056) (Belimumab IB, Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Belimumab produced significant 
improvements in the SLE Responder Index as well as in individual compone nt SELENA -
SLEDAI score in both studies. Pooled analyses demonstrated steroid sparing, delay in median 
time to first flare, and decreased risk of severe flares over 52 weeks. Clinical trial data for 
belimumab since approval continue to show efficacy in the treatment of SLE through decreased 
SLE flares and decreased disease activity across multiple organ systems (Belimumab IB, 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . 
1.4.3  Overall Benefit:Risk Conclusion  
The safety profile of belimumab remains consistent with that known at approval and i s 
consistent with expected events based on the mechanism of action and the disease under study.  
Appropriate risk mitigation measures are in place; rare and long -term risks will be further 
evaluated via the large safety study and registry, ongoing and futur e studies, and routine 
pharmacovigilance.  Review of safety data is conducted on a continual basis in order to identify 
new safety signals which may arise from clinical trial and/or post -marketing reports.  The 
benefit: risk profile of belimumab for SLE cont inues to be favorable.

(SLE)  treated with belimumab plus standard therapy vs placebo plus standard therapy.  
Originally, a pproximately 5, [ADDRESS_633079] s were planned to be rando mized  to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups:  belimumab 10 mg/kg (2,500 subjects) or placebo (2,500 subjec ts) plus standard 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . Subsequent to the reporting of additional placebo controlled data, the sample size was 
reduced to 4,000 subjects in total.  
Subjec ts will receive study agent (belimumab or placebo) on Days 0, 14, 28 and approximately 
every 28 days thereafter through Week  48 with a final visit  conducted at Week  52. Subjects

name [CONTACT_53265].  
Belimumab is a recombinan t human, IgG1λ  monoclonal antibody specific for soluble human B 
lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS, also referred to as BAFF and TNFSF13B).  Belimumab has a 
molec ular weight of approximately [ADDRESS_633093]. Upon reconstitution with 
4.8 mL sterile water for injectio n (SWFI), each vial delivers 400 mg belimumab at 80 mg/mL 
in 0.1 6 mg/mL citric acid, 2. 7 mg/mL sodium citrate, 80 mg/mL  sucrose, 0.4 mg/mL 
polysorbate  80, pH 6.5.  Each lyophilized vial is single use.  
The placebo control is prepared as a sterile and lypholi zed product.  Upon recons titution with 
4.8 mL SWFI, each vial will contain 0.1 6 mg/mL citric acid, 2. 7 mg/mL sodium citrate, 
80 mg/mL sucrose, 0.4 mg/mL polysorbate 80, pH 6.5.  Each lyophilized vial is single use.  
5.2 Packaging, L abeling, Preparation, and S torage  
Belimumab will be supplied in a 20 mL vial containing 400 mg belimumab (deliverable).  
Placebo control will be supplied in a 20 mL vial.  
Lyophilized belimumab and placebo should be stored at 2 -8°C. After reconstitution and dilution 
in normal saline, the material is stable for up to 8 hours at 2 -8°C, or at room  temperature. Refer 
to the Pharmacy Manual for detailed instructions on the preparation, administration, and storage 
of study agent.  
The 400 mg single use vial of study agent will be reconstitute d with 4.8 mL SWFI, to yield a 
final concentration of 80 mg/mL of belimumab. Placebo will be reconstituted with 4.8 mL 
SWFI.  
In addition to any country -specific requirements, the study agent label will contain, at a 
minimum, the following information:

 • Investigational drug statement  
• Sponsor’s  name [CONTACT_492328] 
(mg) using the subject’s current body weight in  kilograms (kg) obtained at each visit prior to 
dosing.  At sites where it is impractical to use the subject’s current body weight to calculate the 
dose, it is permissible for the Week [ADDRESS_633094]’s body weight from the 
previous visit (e.g., the Day 0 weight can be used to calculate the dose for the Week 2 visit).  
The current visit body weight must still be measured prior to dosing and if the current weight 
varies by [CONTACT_726] 10% from the previous visit weight, then the weight measured  at the current 
visit must be used  to calculate the dose . 
The reconstituted study agent will be diluted in [ADDRESS_633095] 
or designee, independent of the study (person responsible for receiving and dispensing study 
agent). Except for a limited number of safety oversight personnel, all other site personnel, the 
subject, the  sponsor and contract research organization (CRO) will remain blinded to the study 
agent received . Separate monitors will be responsible for the clinical (blinded monitor) and 
study agent (unblinded monitor) aspects of the study.  
Study agent inventory/acco untability forms will be examined and reconciled by [CONTACT_492301]. After the end of the study all used and 
unused study agent must be accounted for on a study agent accountability form provided to the 
investigator by [CONTACT_456], or its designee.  
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for more details regarding preparation, storage, handling, and 
drug accountability.  
5.3 Dose, R oute of Administration, and S chedule  
There are 2 treatment groups:  10 mg/kg belimumab and pla cebo.  Both treatment g roups will 
receive other standard  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including steroids, immunomodulatory agents  and 
antimalarials, as appropriate .  
Once randomized, subjects will be dosed with study agent on Days 0, 14, [ADDRESS_633096] 
infusion reactions and hypersensitivity rea ctions may be considered . In the Phase 3 trials, 13% 
of subjects received premedication, which may have mitigated or masked a hypersensitivity

 response; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether premedication 
diminishes the frequency or severity of hypersensitivity reactions. All study agent treatments 
will be administered intravenously (IV) over no less than [ADDRESS_633097] 2 infusions, subjects should be monitored during and for an appropriate period of time 
after infusion according to study sites’ guidelines or standard operating procedure for IV 
infusions.  
Subjects should be made aware of the potential risk,  the signs and symptoms of such reactions, 
and the importance of immediately seeking medical attention. For further information, see the 
belimumab Investigator ’s Brochure.  
5.4 Alteration of Dose/Schedule D ue to Toxicity  
The dose of study agent administered may  not be altered.  The rate of infusion may be slowed 
or interrupted if the subject appears to develop signs of adverse reaction or infusion -associated 
symptoms.  At later visits, these subjects may continue to be infused over a longer infusion 
period at the investigator’s clinical discretion.

agent). Except for a limited number of safety oversight personnel, a ll study site personnel, the 
subject, the sponsor and the Contract Research Organization  (CRO) remain blinded to the study 
agent received .  Separate monitors will be responsible for the clinical (blinded monitor) and 
study agent (unblinded monitor) aspects of the study.  
In the case of a medical emergency when knowledge of the study treatment is essential for the 
appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject, the study blind may be broken for 
the specific subject. Whenever possible, the investigator should discuss options with the 
Medical Monitor prior to unblinding any subject. If this is impractical, the investigator must 
notify the Medical Monitor as soon as possible of any broken blind, but without revealing the 
treatment assignment of the unblinded subject, unless that information is important for the 
safety of subjects currentl y in the study. Any broken blind will be clearly justified and explained 
by a comment in the eCRF.  
[COMPANY_004]’s Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the treatment 
assignment for any subject with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an  expedited regulatory report 
be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the subject’s 
treatment assignment, may be sent to clinical investigators in accordance with local regulations 
and/or [COMPANY_004] policy.

7 Adverse Event Reporting  
The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events 
that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.  
7.1 Definitions  
ADVERSE EVENT (EXPERIENCE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or  clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.  
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory findi ng), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to 
produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.  
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it 
may have been present prior to the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment 
or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE) unless 
this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent.  This should 
be reported regardless of sequelae . 
 
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se w ill not be reported 
as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.

GlaxoSmithKline group of companies    HGS1006 -C1113 (BEL115467)  
 
41 
  
Events that do not  meet the definition of an AE include:  
 
• Medic al or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to 
the procedure is an AE  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuatio ns of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
• The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than ex pected for the subject’s condition  
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT – A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence 
that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492254]:  In g eneral, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492255] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
out-patient setting.  Complicati ons that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492256].  If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492257], the event is 
serious.  When in  doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15537]” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492258] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. Results in disability/incapacity  
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a p erson’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained a nkle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situa tions, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492259]

[ADDRESS_633117] or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in the abo ve definition.  These should also be considered serious.  Examples of such 
events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospit alisation , or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
g. All events of possible drug -induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia defined as ALT 
 3xULN and bilirubin  2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT  3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR 
measured) termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR measurement is not required and the threshold 
value stated will not apply to patients receiving anticoagulants).  
NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testi ng is unavailable, 
record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating direct bilirubin elevations 
and suggesting liver injury. If testing is unavailable and a subject meets the criterion of total 
bilirubin  2xULN, then the event is sti ll reported as an SAE. If INR is obtained, include values 
on the SAE form. INR elevations >1.[ADDRESS_633118] , AESIs,  (see Secti on 8.5.1  for details ) that are identified 
from the start of s tudy medication (Day 0) through Week 52 and regardless if study agent is 
discontinued early will be rec orded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form (AE eCRF).  All 
deaths will be recorded as an outcome from the event that is considered to be the primary event 
leading to death. All data fields on the AE eCRF should be completed.   
7.2.2  Serious Adverse Events  
Serious  Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur from the start of study agent at Day [ADDRESS_633119] be recorded on the SAE eCRF within 
24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of a SAE, regardless of expectedn ess. All fields of 
the SAE eCRF should be completed, but completion of the report should not be held until all 
information is available. Follow -up information and corrections should be added to the SAE 
eCRF within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of the follow -up information as 
described in the  ePharmaSolutions document portal . 
SAEs that occur after Week 52 (or [ADDRESS_633120] year monthly study visits) and that are assessed by [CONTACT_492308] . 
Prior to study drug administration, any SAE assessed as related to study participation (e.g., 
protocol mandated procedures, invasive tests) will be recorded on the SAE wor ksheet and 
reported as described above from the time a subject consents to participate in the study. Pre -
treatment SAEs will not be documented on the SAE eCRF .

 7.3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy  
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resu lting in neurological deficits, including 
fatal cases, has been reported in SLE patients receiving immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy, 
including belimumab. A diagnosis of PML should be considered in any subject presenting with 
new-onset or deteriorating neu rological signs and symptoms. The subject should be referred to 
a neurologist or other appropriate specialist for evaluation. If PML is confirmed, study agent 
should be discontinued and consideration should be given to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_492260].  
If PML is suspected, this should be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor.  The 
appropriateness of continuing study agent, while the case is being assessed, should be discussed . 
7.[ADDRESS_633121] an increased risk of  suicidal behavior and/or ideation (Bachen , 
2009;  Timonen , 2003 ; Stenager , 1992 ). In order to objectively assess suicidality in belimumab 
clinic al programs the C -SSRS (Appendix 4  and Appendix 5 ) will be utilized to collect 
information on suicidal behavior and ideation. ‘Baseli ne’ C -SSRS ( Appendix 4 ) will be used at 
screening ONLY ; whereas, ‘Since Last Visit’ C -SSRS ( Appendix 5 ) will be used at all other 
designated study visits. SLE patients have an increased prevalence of mood and anxiety 
disorders compared with the general population and disease activity may contribute to this 
higher risk. The inc idence of major depressive disorder (MDD) among SLE patients has been 
reported to be as high as 47% (Bachen , 2009 ). Since active SLE and MDD may increase the 
risk of suicid al ideation or behavior before or during clinical studies, subjects participating in 
this study will be assessed for suicidality at every visit.  
Subjects who answer “yes” to any suicidal behavior or “yes” to suicidal ideation questions 4  or 
5 on the C -SSRS should be referred to appropriate psychiatric care and prompts the completion 
of a SAE worksheet.  The medical monitor should be notified when t hese events occur.   In 
addition, a “yes” to any suicidal behavior or “yes” to suicidal ideation questions 3, 4, or 5 on 
the C -SSRS prompts the completion of a Possible Suicidality Related History Questionnaire 
(PSR HQ) eCRF  (PSRHQ, only the first time  this condition is met) , and a Possible Suicidality 
Related Questionnaire (PSRQ) eCRF at all times  this condition is met.  
Baseline/Screening and during treatment (Since Last Visit) assessment of suicidality will be 
performed during the blinded portion of t his study using C -SSRS  (refer to Appendix 4  and 
Appendix 5  for C -SSRS) . The C -SSRS is a brief measure which is designed to assess severity 
and change of suicidality by [CONTACT_492309] [ Posner , 2007]. The C -SSRS 
is admini stered by a qualifie d clinician and is designed to address the need for a summary 
measure to track change in the severity/density of suicidality across both clinical settings and 
treatment trials. It assesses intensity of ideation (a potentially important marker of severity) by 
[CONTACT_492310], duration, intrusiveness, controllability, and deterrents. In 
addition, it captures both the modal and most severe forms of ideation. The C -SSRS is to be 
completed by [CONTACT_15009]/her qu alified designee at every visit  during the blinded 
portion of the study .

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Possible Suicidality Related Questionnaire (PSR Q) 
The investigator will be prompted to complete the PSRQ (in addition to the AE , SAE pages, 
and PSRHQ as appropriate) if a “yes” response is given to any suicidal behavior or a “yes” 
response to suicidal ideation questions 3, 4 or 5 on the C -SSRS. If the adverse event meets the 
definition of an SAE, which includes a “yes” answer to any suicidal behavior or a “yes” to 
suicidal ideat ion questions [ADDRESS_633122]’s pregnancy to final outcome.  
Pregnancies are not considered adverse events. Complications or medical problems associated 
with a pregnancy are considered AEs and may be SAEs. Compl ications or medical problems 
are reported as AEs/SAEs according to the procedure described in Section 7.2. 
7.[ADDRESS_633123] to seriousness (criteria for 
seriousness are listed in Section 7.1), severity (intensity) , and causality (relation ship to study 
agent).  The investigator will make an assessment of intensity based on the Division of 
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Adverse Event Severity Grading Tables (see 
Appendix 7 ) where possible:  
SEVERITY  
Grade [ADDRESS_633124], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities  (Grade 1 
DMID) . 
Grade 2 - Moderate  An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
everyday activities  (Grade 2 DMID) . 
Grade 3 - Severe   An event that prevents normal everyday activities  (Grade 3 or 4 
DMID) . 
Not applicable   Those event(s) where intensity is meaningless or imposs ible to 
determine (i.e., blindness and coma) . 
 
An AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.

 An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre -defined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE.  
CA[LOCATION_003]LITY  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. A "reasonable possib ility" is meant to convey that there are 
facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a rel ationship cannot 
be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Alternative causes, such as n atural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, 
other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment will b e 
considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product 
Information,  for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment.  
For each AE/SAE the investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
There may be situations when an SAE has  occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004].  However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to  [COMPANY_004].   The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_1095] -up information, amending the SAE data collection tool accordingly.  
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  reporting 
requirements .

Adverse Events  
AESI s (see Section 8.5.1  for details) and SAEs that occur from the start of study agent 
administration (Day 0) through  Week 52 are reported.  
After the initial AE SI/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactiv ely follow each subject 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AESIs/SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the 
condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the  subject is lost to follow -
up. Follow -up of AESI/SAE reports  applie s to all subjects, including those withdrawn

8 Endpoints and Statistical Analysis  
8.1 General Statistical Considerations  
This main purpose of this study is to provide an evaluation of  the difference in the rates of all 
prespecified AESI and all cause  mortality between the belimumab and the placebo groups  with 
a 2-sided 95% confidence interval ( CI). SAEs will be analyzed descriptively only.   
Safety  analyses will be performed on the as-treated population defined as all subjects who are 
randomized and received at least 1 dose of study agent , grouped ac cording to the treatment that 
was received for >50% of doses . Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the ITT 
population, grouped  according to the treatment that a subject was randomized to receive, 
regardless of the actual treatment received.   
The final analysis for the [ADDRESS_633128] completed 
through Week 52. The interim analysis is solely for monitoring patients’ safety and reporting 
event rates to health authorities. It will be descriptive in nature and no comparative statistical 
inferences for claims will be made. Therefore, there will be no adjustment to Type I error for 
the interim or the final analyses. To minimize bias and to maintain data integrity, the interim 
analysis will be performed by a statistician who is not affiliated with the study conduct. 
Similarly, sponsor staff wh o have access to the interim results will not be involved in subject 
level monitoring of the study. Site personnel, investigators, and subjects will remain blinded 
until the study is complete and the final results are made public .

determined to be eligible for the study, they will be randomly assigned (via an interactive web 
response system ) to 1 of 2 treatment group s (10 mg/kg belimumab or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio. 
The randomization will be stratified for region (US/Canada vs Central America/South 
America/Mexico vs Europe/Australia/Israel vs Asia), SELENA SLEDAI score ( ≤ 9 vs ≥ 10), 
and steroid dose ( ≤ 7.5 mg/day vs > 7.5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent).

 8.3 Independent Data Monitoring C ommittee (IDMC)  
An IDMC will review unblinded safety data for the study on an ongoing basis until the data are 
locked and analyzed. The IDMC will include at least [ADDRESS_633130]. After initial re view, t he IDMC will review the data approximately every 
6 months.  Events to be monitored during the safety review will include at a minimum 
all serious adverse events (including deaths, serious psychiatric events, and serious 
infections), opportunistic infections (serious and nonserious ), malignancies  (including 
NMSC) , and serious infusion and h ypersensitivity reactions.  Investigators and IRBs/IECs will 
be notified of the outcome of each IDMC meeting.  
The IDMC will receive information within [ADDRESS_633131] imate for mortality and other AESI rates. 
The study design was designed to  allow the difference in mortality rate s between  the placebo 
and the belimumab treated groups to be established with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of  
0.46% (ie,  within -0.46% and 0.46%), assuming the estimated  first year mortality rate was the 
same 0.68% in the 2 treatment groups. The estimat ed reference AE mortality rates were based 
on the annual AE mortality rates in the pooled primary safety database in SLE subjects  
(integrated database of LBSL02 [placebo -controlled treatment phase only], HGS1006 -C1056, 
and HGS1006 -C1057).  
8.4.1  Sample Size Re -Estimation  
Following the completion of  2 additional placebo -controlled trials ( BEL112341/C1115 , 
BEL113750), revised mortality estimates based on data from all 5 of the completed studies 
were as follows: 0.504% ( 6/1,190 for the placebo group) and 0.564% (14 /2,484 for  the 
belimumab group) with a delta of 0.060%.  
 
Using a conservative revised mortality rate of 0.564%, the 95% CI for a 4,[ADDRESS_633132] sample 
size with 1:1 randomization was also 0.46%. As a result, given the revised mortality estimate, 
a sample size of 4,000  subjects  would not result in any loss of precision (i.e., the width of the

 8.5 Endpoints and Analysis  
8.5.1  Safety Endpoint Definitions and Measurements  
The table below describes the safety endpoints and measures collected in the study . All events 
shown  in the table will be collected.  
All-cause mortality  
Serious Infections (including serious opportunistic infections and any event of TB or TB reactivation)  
Non-serious opportunistic infections and other infections of interest (Appendix 2 ) 
Malignancies ( excluding NMSC)  
Non-melanoma skin cancers  
Psychiatric events suggesting serious mood disorders and anxiety  
Suicidality (using C -SSRS; Appendix 4  and Appendix 5 ) 
Serious Infusion and Hypersensitivity Reactions  
All SAEs  
 
8.5.2  Analysis  of Safety Endpoints  
Mortality and AESI  will be analyzed using an estimation paradigm . The difference in the rates 
of all prespecified AESI  and all cause  mortality, between the belimumab and the placebo  groups  
will be evaluated  with a 2-sided 95% CI. Deaths will also  be described in detail, including, in 
the belimumab group, assessment of relationship to belimumab treatment.   
For all cause mortality, the hazard ratio (and its 95% CI) for belimumab vs placebo will be 
estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model, without adjustment for baseline 
randomization factors. The time to death will be censored at the last follow -up by [CONTACT_492315].  
SAEs will be analyzed descriptively only.  The frequency and rate of serious adverse events  
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_11189] (SOC) and preferred term . The SAE rates 
may also be reported adjusted for subject years.   
8.5.3  Efficacy Endpoint Definitions a nd Measurements  
The major efficacy endpoint  is: 
• Percent of subjects whose average prednisone (or equivalent) dose has been reduced by 
≥ 25% from baseline to ≤  7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52  (in the subgroup of 
subjects receiving > 7.5 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) at baseline).  
 
Other effi cacy endpoints include:  
• Use of immunomodulatory medications to treat SLE . 
• Number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2848] .  
2016N273856_0 2 CON FIDENTIAL  
GlaxoSmithKline group of companies   HGS1006 -C1113 (BEL115467)  
50 
 • Percent of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
SLICC /ACR  Damage Index will be recorded at baseline and at Week 52 to permit assessment 
of accrual of damag e in subjects who may be followed a subsequent study.  
8.5.4  Analysis  of Major Efficacy Endpoint  
The percent of subjects with average prednisone (or equivalent) dose that has been reduced by 
≥ 25% from baseline to ≤ 7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52 will be compared between 
the belimumab and the placebo groups using a logistic regression model, adjusted for baseline 
prednisone (or equivalent) dose level, baseline SELENA SLEDAI score ( ≤ 9 vs ≥ 10), and 
region (US/Canada or Central America/South America/Mexico or Europe/Australia/Israel or 
Asia). The analysis will be performed on subjects who were using prednisone (or equivalent) at 
a dose > 7.5 mg/day at baseline. In the analysis, all subjects  who drop out and/or add new 
immunomodulatory agents before the Week 52 visit will be considered having no steroid 
reduction. However, switching immunomodulatory  agents for toxicity reasons or lack of 
availability (eg, no longer manufactured or no longer r eimbursed) is permitted and will not be 
imputed as no steroid reduction. To examine the robustness of the results, a sensitivity analysis 
of the steroid reduction may be performed without considering any information related to the 
use of new immunomodulato ry agents.  
Analysis of other efficacy endpoints will be described in the analytical plan.  
9 Pharmacogenetics (PGx)  
This is an optional sub -study. The IEC/IRB and, where required, the applicable regulatory 
agency must approve the PGx assessments before these can be conducted at the study site. The 
approval(s) must be in writing and clearly specify appro val of the PGx assessments (ie,  approval 
of Appendix 7 ). In some cases, approval of the PGx assessments can occur after approval is 
obtained for the rest of the study. If so, then the written approval will clearly indicate that 
approval of the PGx assessments is being deferred and the study, except for PGx assessments, 
can be initiate d. When PGx assessments are not approved, then approval for the rest of the study 
will clearly indicate this and that PGx assessments will not be conducted . 
In consenting subjects, a blood sample for PGx research will be drawn t o better  characterize 
genetic variability (eg, HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) that may affect efficacy or safety endpoints. Information 
regarding PGx research is included in Appendix 7 .

informed consent document; subject initials) and must be maintained in strict confidence by [CONTACT_1275], except to the extent necessary to allow auditing by [CONTACT_50756], study 
monitor, or sponsor represent atives.  
Site personnel record all data for each study subject through electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs) using an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system provided and approved by [CONTACT_456]. 
Refer to the Study Procedures Manual for additional information r egarding eCRFs that will be 
used as source documentation. Sites must complete the eCRFs in a timely manner and the 
investigator must promptly review the completed eCRFs for each subject. As the person 
ultimately responsible for the accuracy of all eCRF dat a, the investigator must sign the 
Investigator's Statement in each subject's eCRF.  
The EDC system automatically generates queries resulting from the computer checks embedded 
into the system, so as to ensure accuracy, quality, consistency, and completeness of the 
database. Manual queries resulting from review by [CONTACT_53194], medical coders, and other Data 
Management staff are also generated from within the EDC system, where they are tracked. Sites 
resolve the queries and correct the entered data when necessary.  Every change to data is 
captured in the EDC system audit trail. Upon  completion of the study, or after reaching a pre -
specified point in the study, Data Management will lock the database and generate the SAS 
datasets necessary for data analysis and report ing. Upon  completion of the study, each site will 
be provided with a compact disk containing the eCRFs for each of their subjects.

“Infections of Interest” include o pportunistic infections and other infections of intere st 
generally not con sidered opportunistic.  Opportunistic infections are a subset of infections that 
are caused by [CONTACT_492317], or more severe illness, when the immu ne system is suppressed.  Since 
there are no general guidelines for labeling pathogens as opportunistic without considering the 
host's immune condition, identification of opportunistic infections and other infections of 
interest in this study is based on th e following list of pathogens which when present may 
indicate immune suppression in a subject. These pathogens and infections in general are rarely  
observed in immunocompetent individuals and will be considered opportunistic. Pathogens 
considered to cause opportunistic infections and other infections of interest include but are not 
limited to the following:  
Acinetobacter infection  
Aspergillosis  
Blastomycosis, extrapulmonary  
Candidiasis of esophagus, bronchi, trachea, or lungs  
Coccidio idomycosis, dissemintaed or extrapulmonary  
Cryptococcosis, extrapulmonary  
Cryptosporidiosis infection, chronic intestinal (> 1 month duration)  
Cytomegalovirus disease (other than liver, spleen, or nodes)  
Herpes simplex bronchitis, pneumonitis, or esophagitis  
Dissemina ted h erpes zoster or involving at least [ADDRESS_633153] epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  (see other infections of 
interest below)  
Histoplasmosis disseminated or extrapulmonary  
Human polyomavirus infection  
Isosporiasis, chronic intestinal (> 1 month’s duration)  
Listeriosis  
Mycobacteri um avium complex or M. Kansasii, disseminated or extrapulmonary  
Mycobacterium infections, other species or unidentified species, disseminated or 
extrapulmonary (eg, M. haemophilium, M. fortuitum, or M. marinum)  
Nocardiosis  
Polyomavirus (JC virus or BK vir us)-associated nephropathy (including progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy)  
Pneumocystis jiroveci infection  
Toxoplasmosis of brain

 Appendix 7  Pharmacogenetic Research  
 
Background  
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is the study of variability in drug response due to hereditary factors in 
different populations. There is increasing evidence that an in dividual's genetic composition 
(ie, genotype) may impact pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (relationship between 
concentrations and pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) and/or 
clinical outcome (in  terms of efficacy and/or saf ety and tolerability).  
A key component to successful PGx research is the collection of samples during the conduct of 
clinical studies.  
Research Rationale  
Blood samples for pharmacogenetics will be drawn as described in Section 9. Collection of 
whole blood samples, even when no a priori  hypothesis has been identified, may enable PGx 
analyses to be conducted if there is unexplained or unexpected variation in response  to 
belimumab.  
If at any time it appears there is potential variability in response in this clinical study or in a 
series of clinical studies with belimumab that may be attributable to genetic variations of 
subjects, the following objectives may be invest igated:  
• Relationship between genetic variants and the pharmacokinetics of belimumab.  
• Relationship between genetic variants and safety and/or tolerability of belimumab.  
• Relationship between genetic variants and efficacy of belimumab.  
 
Study Population  
Any subject who has given informed consent to participate in the clinical study, has met all the 
entry criteria for the clinical study, and receives belimumab may take part in the PGx research.  
Subject participation in the PGx research is voluntary and refusa l to participate will not indicate 
withdrawal from the clinical  study. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of 
benefits to which the subject would otherwise be entitled.  
Informed Consent  
Subjects who do not wish to participate in the PGx research may still participate in the clinical 
study. PGx informed consent must be obtained prior to any blood being taken for PGx research.

will be collected for the PGx research at baseline. The PGx sample is labeled (or coded) with a 
study specific number that can be traced or linked back to the subject by [CONTACT_492318]. Coded samples do not carry personal identif iers (such as name [CONTACT_78207]). 
The blood sample will be taken on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due 
to inability to utilize the original sample. The blood samples should  be drawn on Day 0 
(baseline), provided informed consent for PGx research has been obtained from the subject , but 
the sample may be taken at any time while the subject is participating in the clinical study.   
If deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is extracted fro m the blood sample, the DNA will be subjected 
to sample quality control analysis. This analysis will involve the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_492269]. If inconsistencies are noted in the 
analysis, then those samples may be destroyed.  
The need to conduct PGx analysis may be identified after a study (or set of studies) of 
belimumab has been completed and the study data reviewed. In some cases, the samples may 
not be studied.  
Samples will be stored securely and  may be kept for up to [ADDRESS_633185] 
completes the study or the sponsor may destroy the samples sooner. The sponsor or those 
working with the sponsor (for example, other researchers or a contract lab) will use samples 
collected from the s tudy for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the subject informed 
consent form.  
Subjects may request their sample to be destroyed at any time.  
Subject Withdrawal from Study  
If a subject who has consented to participate in PGx research and has a samp le taken for PGx 
research withdraws from the clinical study for any reason other than lost to follow -up, the 
subject will be given the following options:  
1. The sample is retained for PGx research.  
2. The sample is destroyed.  
 
If a subject withdraws consen t from the PGx research or requests sample destruction for any 
reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample 
destruction within the timeframe specified by [CONTACT_492319]. In either case, the sponsor will only use study information 
collected/generated up to that point.

Pharmacog enetic Analyses  
Specific sections of DNA may be selected from areas of the genome (ie, candidate genes). The 
candidate genes could include the drug target, the drug target pathway, drug metabolizing 
enzymes, genes associated with mechanisms underlying adve rse events, and genes associated 
with the study disease.  
In addition, a genome -wide scan or large scale sequencing  of polymorphic markers located 
across the genome may be implemented. This approach is often employed when potential 
genetic effects are not well understood.  
Other new technologies may be developed to help us better study and understand genetic 
variants associated with drug response.  
Continuing research may identify other enzymes, transporters, proteins, or receptors that may 
be involved in res ponse to belimumab. The genes that may code for these proteins may also be 
studied.  
Components of the PGx analysis may include:  
• Hardy -Weinberg Equilibrium testing  
The genotypic frequencies of each polymorphism will be evaluated for conformity to those 
expected under normal conditions by [CONTACT_53205] -Weinberg Equilibrium testing.  
• Comparison of Demographic and Baseline Characteristics by [CONTACT_492321] c ompared among genotype (or haplotype) subgroups.  
• Evaluation of Genotypic Effects  
Analyses may be carried out to evaluate the degree of association between subject’s 
genotype (or  haplotype) and selected parameters (eg, pharmacokinetics, disease activity and  
safety). Where such genotypic tests are inappropriate (eg, where the number of marker 
genotypes is too large and/or the frequency of individual genotypes too small), allelic tests 
may be conducted. Allelic tests evaluate whether the frequency of each mark er allele is the 
same in responders and non -responders.

 • Evaluation of Treatment by [CONTACT_53252] -Gene Interaction  
In addition to evaluating the main effects of the genotypes (haplotypes or alleles) on the 
selected parameters, the possibility of a treatment group by [CONTACT_7631] (haplotype or allele) 
interaction will also be explored. If appropriate, the joint effects of multiple markers (gene -
gene interactions) may also be evaluated.  
• Linkage Disequilibrium  
For pairs of polymorphisms, the degree to whic h alleles from the 2 sites are correlated 
(linkage disequilibrium) may also be evaluated. If the genotypes at 2 polymorphic sites 
within a gene are shown to be statistically associated with a response to study agent , the 
degree of linkage disequilibrium wi ll aid interpretation in that it will indicate the extent to 
which the 2 sites are exerting independent effects.  
• Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
Adjustment to observed p -values may be made to limit erroneous conclusions due to 
multiple tests when mul tiple markers are evaluated (especially in the case of a genome scan 
for association).  
• Power and Sample Size Considerations  
The ability to detect differential drug response among genotypes at a polymorphic site 
depends on the total number of subjects geno typed and the frequency distribution of the 
different genotypes. Consequently, genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_492270]; 
however, these frequencies will  not be known until sufficient samples have been collected 
and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_53090]. These examples show that small sample sizes typi[INVESTIGATOR_492271] [ADDRESS_633187]’s PGx Data  
The sponsor may summarize the cumulative PGx research results in the clinical study report or 
in a separate report. In general, the sp onsor does not inform the investigator, subject or anyone 
else (eg, family members, study investigators, primary care physicians, insurers, or employers) 
of the PGx research results because the information generated from PGx studies is preliminary 
in natur e, and the significance and scientific validity of the results are undetermined at such an 
early stage of research, under any circumstance unless required by [CONTACT_2371].

MONITORING:  
For bilirubin or INR criteria:   
• Repeat liver chemistries (include ALT, AST, 
alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin)  and perform 
liver event follow up assessments within  24 
hrs 
• Monitor subjects twice weekly until liver 
chemistries resolve, stabilize o r return to 
within baseline  
• A specialist or hepatology consultation is 
recommended  
For All other criteria:  
• Repeat liver chemistries  (include ALT, AST, 
alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin ) and perform  
liver event follow up assessments within  24-
72 hrs  
• Monitor  subjects weekly until liver chemistries 
resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline  including acetaminophen, herbal remedies, 
other over the counter medications . 
• Record alcohol use on the liver event 
alcohol intake case report form  
 
For bilirubin or INR criteria:  
• Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle 
antibody , Type 1 anti -liver kidney 
microsomal antibodies, and quantitative 
total immunoglobulin G (IgG or gamma 
globulins).  
• Serum acetaminophen adduct HPLC assay 
(quantifies potential acetaminophen 
contribution to liver injury in subjects with 
definite or likely a cetaminophen use in the 
preceding week [ James , 2009]). NOTE: not 
required in China   
• Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic 
resonance, or computerised tomography)  
and /or liver biopsy  to evaluate liver 
disease; complete Liv er Imaging and/or 
Liver Biopsy CRF forms . 
1. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately 
available, discontinue study treatment for that subject if ALT  3xULN and bilirubin  2xULN. Additionally,  if serum bilirubin 
fractionation  testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating direct 
bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury.  
2. All events of ALT  3xULN and bilirubin  2xULN (>35% direct bilirub in) or ALT  3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured 
which may indicate severe liver injury (possible ‘Hy’s Law’), must be reported as an SAE (excluding studies of hepatic 
impairment or cirrhosis) ; INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply to subjects 
receiving anticoagulants . 
3. New or worsening symptoms  believed to be related to liver injury  (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersensitivity (such as fever, rash or eosinophilia) .    
4. Includes : Hepatitis A IgM antibody; Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis  B Core Antibody (IgM); Hepatitis C RNA; 
Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody;  Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, obtain heterophile 
antibody or monospot testing);  Hepatitis E IgM antibody.  
5. If hepatitis delta anti body assay cannot  be performed,  it can be replaced with a PCR of hepatitis D RNA virus (where 
needed) [ Le Gal , 2005].  
6. PK sample may not be required for subjects known to be re ceiving placebo or non -[COMPANY_004] comparator treatments.  Record 
the date/time of the PK blood sample draw and the date/time of the last dose of study treatment prior to blood sample 
draw on the CRF. If the date or time of the last dose is unclear, provide the su bject’s best approximation. If the date/time 
of the last dose cannot be approximated OR a PK sample cannot be collected in the time period indicated above, do not 
obtain a PK sample. Instructions for sample handling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_492282].

 Appendix 10  Liver Safety – Study Treatment Restart or R echallenge 
Guidelines  Liver  
If subject meets liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90549]/rechallenge subject with study 
treatment unless:  
• [COMPANY_004] Medical Governance approval is granted  (as described below),  
• Ethics and/or IRB approval is obtained, if requi red, and  
• Separate consent for treatment restart/rechallenge is signed by [CONTACT_492322]/rechallenge subject with study treatment is 
not granted , then subject must permanently discontinue study treatment and may co ntinue 
in the study for protocol -specified follow up assessments , 
Rechallenge Following Liver Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_492283] -induced liver injury, drug rechallenge is associated with a 13% mortality 
across all drugs in prospective studies  [Andrade , 2009]. Clinical outcomes vary by [CONTACT_9934], with 
nearly 50% fatality with halothane readministered within one month of in itial injury. However, 
some drugs seldom result in recur rent liver injury or fatality. Risk factors for a fatal drug 
rechallenge outcome include:  
• Hypersensitivity  [Andrade , 2009]  with initial liver injury (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia)  
• jaundice or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver injury (direct bilirubin >35% of total)  
• subject currently  exhibits severe liver injury defined by: [CONTACT_42386] 3xULN, bilirubin 2xULN 
(direct bilirubin >35% of total), or INR1.5 
• serious adverse event or fatality has earlier been observed with drug rechallenges  [Hunt , 
2010;  Papay , 2009]  
• evidence of drug -related preclinical liability (e.g. reactive metabolites;  mitochondrial 
impairment  [Hunt , 2010].  
Rechallenge refers to resuming study treatment following drug induced liver injury (DILI). 
Because of the risks associated with rechallenge after DILI this should only be considered for 
a subj ect for whom there is compelling evidence of benefit from a critical or life -saving 
medicine, there is no alternative approved medicine available, and a benefit:risk assessment of 
rechallenge is considered to be favourable.  
 
Approval by [CONTACT_492323]:  
• Principal Investigator (PI)  requests consideration of rechallenge  with study treatment  for a 
subject who is receiving compelling benefit with study treatment that exceeds risk, and no 
effective alternative the rapy is available.   
• Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board approval for rechallenge with study 
treatment must be obtained, as required.

 • If the rechallenge is approved by [CONTACT_492324], the subject must be 
provided with a cle ar description of the possible benefits and risks of study treatment 
administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death.   
• The subject must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the rechallenge with 
study treatment.  Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart.   
• Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by [CONTACT_23983].  
• Subjec ts approved by [CONTACT_492325] a week for liv er chemistry tests until stable  liver chemistries have 
been demonstrated and then standard laboratory monitoring may resume as per prot ocol.  
• If after study treatment rechallenge, subject meets protocol -defined liver chemistry 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], study treatment should be permanently discontinued.  
• [COMPANY_004] Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as 
required, must  be informed of the subject’s outcome following study treatment rechallenge.  
• [COMPANY_004] to be notified of any adverse events, as per Section  7.2.  
Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_492284] a 
clear underlying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g. biliary obstruction, pancreatic 
events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, there should be no evidence of 
alcoholic hepatitis or hypersensitivity, and the study treatment  should not be associated with 
HLA markers of liver injury.  
 
Approval by [CONTACT_42390]:  
• Investigator  requests consideration for study treatment restart if liver chemistries have a 
clear underlying cause (e.g., biliary obs truction, hypotension and liver chemistries have 
improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and ALT <3xULN).  
• Restart risk factors (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia, or hypersensitivity, alcoholic hepatitis, 
possible study treatment -induced liver injury)  or study treatment has an HLA genetic 
marker associated with liver injury (e.g. lapatinib, abacavir, amoxicillin/clavulanate) are 
reviewed and excluded.  
• Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board approval of study treatment restart must 
be obtained, a s required.  
• If restart of study treatment is approved by [CONTACT_90652], the subject 
must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of study 
treatment administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or 
death.   
• The subject must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the study treatment 
restart.  Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart.

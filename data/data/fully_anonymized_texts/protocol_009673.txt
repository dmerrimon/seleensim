2 SYNOPSIS  Rationale  Modulation of the immune checkpoi nts has permanently altered the therapeutic landscape of 
previously treated advanced NSCLC.  PD1 inhibi tion with nivolumab is associated with overall 
response rates (ORRs) of about 20% in patients with advanced previously treated squamous and non-squamous NSCLC and, importantly, improves overall survival (OS) compared with 
docetaxel (Brahmer et al. 2015; Paz-Ares et al. 2015).  Nivolumab is associated with less 
frequent treatment-related adverse events compar ed with docetaxel.  In  non-squamous NSCLC, 
69% vs.88% of patients had events of any gr ade, and 10% vs. 54% had events of grade ≥ 3, 
respectively.  Similarly, in squa mous NSCLC, 58% vs. 86% had even ts of any grade, and 7% vs. 
55% had events of grade ≥ 3, respectively (2% of docetaxel treat ed patients had events of grade 
5).  In advanced NSCLC patients,  PD1 blockade with pembrolizumab  is associated with an ORR 
of 19%, and a median duration of response ( DOR) of 12.5 months. In patients with PD-L1 
positive tumors (PD-L1 expression in ≥ 50% of cells in tumor nests or PD-L1+ bands in stroma 
as assessed by [CONTACT_213172] 22C3 antibody clone), the response 
rate is 45% (Gar on et al. 2015).   
 In an ongoing Phase 1/2, multicente r, open-label study evaluating the safety and clinical efficacy 
of the PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab 10 mg /kg IV every 2 weeks in patients with 
multiple solid tumor types including NSCLC, the ORR in NSCLC was 14% (23% in patients with PD-L1+ tumors by [CONTACT_200003]263Ventana PD-L [ADDRESS_255651]), and the disease 
control rate (DCR) at 24 weeks was 24% (Rizvi  et al. 2015). ORR wa s higher in squamous 
(21%) than in non-squamous patients (10%), an d responses were durable. Drug-related adverse 
events (AEs) were reported in 48% of patien ts and were most freque ntly fatigue (14%), 
decreased appetite (9%), and nausea (8%). Grade ≥ 3 drug-related AEs were reported in 6% of 
patients.  Recently, several phase I/II clinical tr ials have evaluated th e clinical activity of 
monotherapy with PD1 and PD-L [ADDRESS_255652] line treatment of advanced 
NSCLC.  These clinical trials indicate early evidence of durable antitumor activity  with response 
rates of 23-29% and tolerable toxici ty profiles similar to what ha s been previously demonstrated 
with PD1 and PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition.  Th ere are currently several ongoing randomized 
phase III clinical trials evaluating PD1 and PD-L1 blocking antibodies in the 1st line treatment of 
advanced NSCLC.  MYSTIC is a phase III open-label study of 1st line durvalumab (20 mg/kg IV 
every 4 weeks) with or without  a monoclonal antibody to CTLA- 4, tremelimumab (1 mg/kg IV 
every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses), vs. standa rd of care chemothera py in advanced NSCLC 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED].)  Notably, this clinical trial is being conducted in patients with an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) pe rformance status of 0 or 1. 
 
An ECOG performance status of 2 (PS2) is defi ned as being “ambulatory and capable of all self-
care but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about mo re than 50% of waking hours” 
(Oken et al. 1982). Up to 30 to 40% lung cancer pa tients present with an ECOG PS2 (Buccheri et 
al. 1996; Lilenbaum 2006).  Performance status has long been recognized as an independent 
prognostic factor for survival, t hus patients with a PS2 have typi[INVESTIGATOR_213150] (Stanley 1980; Brundage et al. 2002) .  More recent phase II and III 
clinical studies dedicated to defining the optimal therapeutic strategy in PS2 patients have

NSCLC (Lilenbaum et al. 2005; L ilenbaum et al. 2008; Zukin et al . 2013).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_213151], 
platinum-based therapy in NSCLC patients with  marginal performance status has not been 
universally adopted due to the pe rceived burden of excess toxicity associated with therapy (West 
2013).     Study Design  This is a single-arm phase II clinical trial ev aluating the safety and efficacy of the PD-L1 
inhibitor durvalumab as first- line therapy in 50 patients with  advanced NSCLC and ECOG PS2.  
 
Hypothesis  We hypothesize that PD-L1 inhibition with durvalu mab is a tolerable regimen with clinical 
activity in PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC.  Primary Objectives  
 To estimate overall survival (OS) with dur valumab in advanced NSCLC patients with an 
ECOG PS2.  
 To estimate the safety of durvalumab in NSCLC patients with PS2 as determined by 
[CONTACT_479] ≥ 3treatment related adverse events. 
 
Secondary Objectives 
 
 To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) with durvalumab in advanced NSCLC 
patients with PS2.   
 To estimate overall response rate (ORR). 
 To estimate the rate of 12-month survival (OS12). 
 To estimate OS, PFS, and O RR by [CONTACT_4002]-L1 expression status 
 To estimate the health related quality of li fe (HRQL) associated with durvalumab therapy 
in advanced NSCLC patients with PS 2.

4 Durvalumab will be supplied in glass vials containing 500 mg of liquid solution at a concentration of 50 mg/mL for intravenous (IV) administration.  Durvalumab will be 
administered at 1500 mg (fixed dose) q 4 weeks until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent fo r a maximum of 12 months of therapy. 
 Statistical Methods  
 Primary Objectives:  
o The OS curve and a 90% confidence interval for the median OS will be estimated by [CONTACT_10062] (the Kaplan-Meier  method for survival, and the Greenwood 
variance formula applied to l og-transformed survival).  Prior phase II/III clinical 
trials have demonstrated a median OS  of about 5 months  with single agent 
therapy in PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC (Lilenbaum et al. 2005; Lilenbaum et al. 2008; Zukin et al. 2013).   A median OS of 9 months with durvalumab 
would demonstrate a clini cally meaningful improvement over the historical 
control median OS of 5 months with single agent therapy.  Assuming 18 months 
of accrual with 6 months of follow-up, N=[ADDRESS_255654] 85% power for a 90% confidence interval  for median surviv al to exclude 5 
months (and 78% power for a 95% confidence interval).   
 
o Safety will be summarized for all patien ts who receive at least one dose of study 
drug.  All adverse events that  are determined to be possibly, probably or definitely 
related to treatment will be tabulated according to grade and type, in order of 
frequency. Each adverse event will be c ounted only once per patient, with the 
highest grade recorded. Serious adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest (ASEI, defined in section 8.1 .3) will also be tabulated by [CONTACT_35043]. 
Listings will be provided for all on-study d eaths and adverse events that lead to 
withdrawal from study.    A rate of grade ≥3 treatment related adverse events of 
30% or less would suggest that durvaluma b is more tolerabl e than a platinum 
doublet in this population [Lilenbaum et al. 2008].  
 
 Secondary Objectives:  
o PFS will be evaluated using the same me thodology as for OS.  PFS and OS will 
be evaluated for all patients and for subgroups by [CONTACT_4002]-L1 status.  The ORR and OS12 will be estimated with a 90% Wils on Score confidence interval, for all 
patients and based on PD-L1 status. HRQL at baseline, the end of each 4-week 
cycle, and at the end of therapy wi ll be assessed using the FACT-L v4 
questionnaire (Cella, 2007).  Total scores  and subscales will be summarized for 
each patient, and analyzed using standa rd linear mixed models methods and 
generalized estimating equations.   The pr imary analysis will summarize baseline 
QOL, average change over the first two cy cles of treatment, and average QOL in 
survivors at approximately  6 months and 12 months.

 2. BACKGROUND 
 2.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the [LOCATION_002] and worldwide (Siegel 
et al. 2015). An estimated 221,200 new lung cancer  cases will be diagnosed in 2015 in the 
[LOCATION_002] alone, and 158,040 lung cancer deaths are estimated to  occur (Siegel et al. 2015). 
A series of large randomized controlled phase I II clinical trials esta blished platinum-based 
doublets as the standard of care in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC with response rates of 20-
30% and a median survival of 8- 11 months (Fossella et al. 2003; Kelly et al. 2001; Scagliotti et 
al. 2002; Schiller et al. 2002; Za tloukal et al. 2203). In patients  with newly diagnosed advanced 
NSCLC, cisplatin/pemetrexed and cisplatin/gemc itabine were associated with similar efficacy, 
though a histology specific survival  benefit was noted in patients  with non-squamous histology 
with pemetrexed-based therapy, wh ile a survival detriment was not ed in patients with squamous 
histology (Scagliotti et al. 2008) . Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to VEGF has been 
associated with a survival advantage in combin ation with carboplatin/pac litaxel compared with 
carboplatin/paclitaxel alone in patients with non-squamous NSCLC (Sandl er et al. 2006).   
 Recent advances in the treatment  of metastatic NSCLC have co me from recognition that NSCLC 
is not a single disease entity, but rather a collection of distinct molecularly-driven neoplasms.  
Lynch et al. and Paez et al. first described a su bset of patients with NSCLC harboring activating 
mutations in the EGFR gene who responded to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) (Lynch  et al. 2004; Paez et al. 2004). This discovery permanently
  shifted the landscape 
of NSCLC therapy to a personalized approach ba sed on the molecular alterations of a patient’s 
tumor; a paradigm typi[INVESTIGATOR_213152], but also in ALK translocati on driven adenocarcinomas  of the lung and more

12 recently, the therapeutic advances in l ung adenocarcinomas harboring ROS1 gene 
rearrangements (Kwak et al. 2010; Bergethon et al. 2012; Shaw et al. 2014).  In the treatment of the majority of patients without an acti onable oncogenic driver, modulation of 
the immune checkpoints has altered the therapeuti c landscape of previously treated advanced 
NSCLC.  PD1 inhibition with nivolumab is associated with overall response rates (ORRs) of 
about 20% in patients with a dvanced previously treated sq uamous and non-s quamous NSCLC 
and, importantly, improves overall survival (OS) compared with docetaxel (Brahmer et al. 2015; 
Paz-Ares et al. 2015).  Nivolumab  is associated with less freq uent treatment-re lated adverse 
events compared with docetaxel .  In non-squamous NSCLC, 69% vs.88% of patients had events 
of any grade, and 10% vs. 54% had events of grade ≥ 3, respectively.  Similarly, in squamous 
NSCLC, 58% vs. 86% had events  of any grade, and 7% vs. 55% had events of grade ≥ 3, 
respectively (2% of docetaxel tr eated patients had events of gr ade 5).  In advanced NSCLC 
patients, PD1 blockade with pembrolizumab is associated with an ORR of 19%, and a median 
duration of response (DOR) of 12.5 months. In patients with PD-L1 positive tumors (PD-L1 
expression in ≥  50% of cells in tumor nests or PD-L 1+ bands in stroma as assessed by 
[CONTACT_213173] 22C3 antibody clone), the response rate is 45% 
(Garon et al. 2015).    2.2 Durvalumab  
 Investigators should be familiar with the current durvalumab Investigator Brochure (IB Version 
9.0)  Durvalumab is being developed as  a potential anticancer therapy fo r patients with advanced solid 
tumors. Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (Mab) of the immunoglobulin G1 kappa 
(IgG1κ) subclass that inhibits bindi ng of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (B7 homolog 
1 [B7-H1], cluster of differentiation [CD]274)  to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; CD279) and 
CD80 (B7-1). Durvalumab is composed of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light chains, 
with an overall molecular weight  of approximately 149 kDa. Du rvalumab contains a triple 
mutation in the constant domain of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 h eavy chain that reduces binding 
to complement protein C1q and the fragment crystallizable gamma (Fc γ) receptors involved in 
triggering effector function.  2.2.1 Summary of non-clinical experience 
 The non-clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the durvalumab 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB Version 9.0)    
 
Durvalumab binds with high affini ty and specificity to human PD -L1 and blocks its interaction 
with PD-[ADDRESS_255662] of PD-L1 on primary human T cells, resulting in their restored prolif eration and release of 
interferon gamma (IFN- γ). Additionally, durvalumab demonstrated a lack of antibody-dependent 
cell-med
iated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxici ty (CDC) in cell-based 
functional assays. In vivo studi es show that durvalumab inhib its tumor growth in a xenograft 
model via a T lymphocyte (T-cell) dependent mechanism. Moreover, an anti-mouse PD-L1 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
13 antibody demonstrated improved survival in a syngeneic tumor model when given as 
monotherapy and resulted in complete tumor regr ession in > 50% of treated mice when given in 
combination with chemotherapy. Combination ther apy (dual targeting of PD-L1 and cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4]) result ed in tumor regression in a mouse model of 
colorectal cancer.   Cynomolgus monkeys were selected as the on ly relevant species for evaluation of the 
pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacody namics and potential toxicity  of durvalumab. Following 
intravenous (IV) administration, the PK of durvalumab in cynom olgus monkeys was nonlinear. 
Systemic clearance (CL) decrease d and concentration half-life (t 1/2) increased with increasing 
doses, suggesting saturable target binding-medi ated clearance of durvalumab. No apparent 
gender differences in PK profiles  were observed for durvalumab.  
 In general, treatment of cynom olgus monkeys with durvalumab was not associated with any 
durvalumab-related adverse effects that were considered to be  of relevance to humans. Adverse 
findings in the non-Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) PK/pharmacodynamic s and dose range-
finding study, and a GLP 4-week repeat-dose to xicity study were cons istent with antidrug 
antibody (ADA)-associated morbidity and mortality in  individual animals. The death of a single 
animal in the non-GLP, PK/pha rmacodynamics, and dose range-fi nding study was consistent 
with an ADA-associated acute anaphylactic reac tion. The spectrum of fi ndings, especially the 
clinical signs and micr oscopic pathology, in a single animal  in the GLP, 4-week, repeat-dose 
study was also consistent with ADA immune  complex deposition, and ADA: durvalumab 
immune complexes were identified in a subsequent non-GLP, investigative immunohistochemistry study. Simila r observations were reported in cynomolgus monkeys 
administered human mAbs unrelat ed to durvalumab. Given that immunogenicity of human mAbs 
in nonclinical species is genera lly not predictive of responses in humans, the ADA-associated 
morbidity and mortality were not  considered for the determina tion of the no-observed-adverse-
effect level (NOAEL) of durvalumab.   Finally, data from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 3-month GLP t oxicity study with durvalumab in cynomolgus 
monkeys showed that subchronic dosing of durva lumab was not associated with any adverse 
effects. Therefore, the NOAEL of durvalumab in all the general toxicity studies was considered 
to be 100 mg/kg, the highest dose tested in these studies. In addition to the in vivo  toxicology 
data, no unexpected membrane bind ing of durvalumab to human or  cynomolgus monkey tissues 
was observed in GLP tissue cross-reactivity studies using normal human and cynomolgus monkey tissues.  2.2.2 Summary of clinical experience 
 
Clinical experience with durvalumab is fully desc ribed in the current version of the durvalumab 
Investigator’s Brochure (Version 9.0). 
 As of the DCO dates (15Apr2015 to 12Jul2015, Du rvalumab IB Versi on 8.0), a total of 1,[ADDRESS_255663] been enrolled and treated in 30 ongoing durvalumab clinic al studies, including 20 
sponsored and 10 collaborative studies. Of  the 1,883 subjects, 1,279 received durvalumab 
monotherapy, 440 received durvalu mab in combination with trem elimumab or other anticancer 
  
HCC #:16-054

14 agents, 14 received other agents (1 gefitini b, 13 MEDI6383), and [ADDRESS_255664] Metabolism   Study CD-ON-durvalumab-1108: As of 09 Feb2015, PK data were available for 378 subjects 
in the dose-escalation and dose-expansion phases of Study CD-ON- durvalumab-1108 following 
treatment with durvalumab 0.1 to 10 mg/kg ever y 2 weeks (Q2W) or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks 
(Q3W). The maximum observed concentration (C
max) increased in an approximately dose-
proportional manner over the dose range of 0.1 to  15 mg/kg. The area unde r the concentration-
time curve from 0 to 14 days (AUC 0-14) increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner 
over the dose range of 0.1 to 3 mg/kg and increased dose-proportionally at ≥ 3 mg/kg. These 
results suggest durvalumab exhibi ts nonlinear PK likely due to saturable target-mediated CL at 
doses < 3 mg/kg and approaches linearity at doses ≥  3 mg/kg. Near complete target saturation 
(soluble programmed cell death ligand 1 [sPD-L 1] and membrane bound) is expected with 
durvalumab ≥ 3 mg/kg Q2W. Exposures after multiple  doses showed accumulation consistent 
with PK parameters estimated from the first dos e. In addition, PK simulations indicate that 
following durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W dosing, > 90% of subjects are expected to maintain PK 
exposure ≥ 40 µg/mL throughout the dosing interval. 
 As of 09 Feb2015, a total of 388 subjects provide d samples for ADA analysis. Only 8 of 388 
subjects ([ADDRESS_255665] each in 0.1, 1, 3, and 15 mg/kg cohorts, and 4 subjects in 10 mg/kg cohort) were ADA positive with an impact on PK/pharmac odynamics in [ADDRESS_255666] in the 3 mg/kg cohort. 
 Safety   The safety profile of durvalum ab as monotherapy and combined  with other anticancer agents 
was consistent with the pharmacology of the ta rget and other agents in the immune checkpoint 
inhibitor class. No tumor types appeared to be associated with unique AEs. Immune-related AEs 
(irAEs), which are important risks of immune checkpoint inhibitors, have been observed with durvalumab and include colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis/hepatotoxicity, neuropathy/neuromuscular 
toxicity, endocrinopathy, dermat itis, and nephritis. In addition, pancreatitis is an important 
potential risk particularly with durvaluma b and tremelimumab comb ination therapy. These 
events are manageable by [CONTACT_213174]/establishe d treatment guidelines as  described in the study 
protocols.  AEs reported with durvalumab monotherapy in key clinical st udies are described below.

15 Adverse Event Profile of Durvalumab Monotherapy  Study CD-ON-durvalumab-1108: The safety profile of durvalumab monotherapy in the 
694 subjects with advanced solid tumo rs treated at 10 mg/kg Q2W in Study 
CD-ON-durvalumab-[ADDRESS_255667] received durvalumab monotherapy (not including s ubjects treated with blinded 
investigational product) across the clinical development prog ram. The majority of treatment-
related AEs were manageable with  dose delays, symptomatic treatment, and in the case of events 
suspected to have an immune basis, the use of  established treatment guidelines for immune-
mediated toxicity. As of 07 May2015, among the 694 subjects treated with durvalumab 10 mg/kg 
Q2W in Study CD-ON-durvalumab-1108, a total of 378 subjects (54.5%) experienced a 
treatment-related AE, with the most frequent (occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects) being fatigue 
(17.7%), nausea (8.6%), diarrhea (7.3%), decrea sed appetite (6.8%), pruritus (6.3%), rash 
(6.1%), and vomiting (5.0%). A majority of the treatment-related AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 
in severity with ≥ Grade 3 events occurring in 65 subjects (9.4%). Treatment-related ≥ Grade 3 
events reported in 3 or more subjects ( ≥ 0.4%) were fatigue (12 s ubjects, 1.7%); increased

subjects were colitis and pneumoni tis (3 subjects each). A majority of the treatment-related SAEs 
were ≥ Grade 3 in severity and resolved with or without sequelae. AE s that resulted in permanent 
discontinuation of durvalumab were considered as treatment relate d in 18 subjects (2.6%), with 
colitis being the most frequent treatment-related  AE resulting in discon tinuation (3 subjects). A

Study D4191C00003/ATLANTIC in subjec ts with locally advanced or  metastatic non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with durvalum ab 10 mg/kg Q2W. As of 05May2015, 264 of 
303 subjects (87.1%) reported any AE in Study D4191C00003/ATLANTIC. Overall, events 
reported in ≥ 10% of subjects were dyspnea (18.8%),  fatigue (17.8%), decreased appetite 
(17.5%), cough (14.2%), pyrexia (1 2.2%), asthenia (11.9%), a nd nausea (11.2%). Nearly two-

measurable disease at baseline, and ≥ 1 follow-up scan, or discontinued due to disease 
progression or death without any follow-up scan). In PD-L1 unselected patients, the objective response rate (ORR), based on inve stigator assessment per Respons e Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, ranged from 0% in uveal me lanoma (n = 23) to 2 0.0% in bladder cancer 
(n = 15), and disease control ra te at 24 weeks (DCR-24w) ranged from 4.2% in triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC; n = 24) to 39.1% in advan ced cutaneous melanoma (n = 23). PD-L1 status 
was known for [ADDRESS_255673] for bladder can cer, advanced cutaneous mela noma, hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC; n = 3 each, 33.3% each), NSCLC (n = 86, 26.7 %), and squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (SCCHN; n = 22, 18.2%). In the PD-L1-positive subset, D CR-24w was highest in 
advanced cutaneous melanoma (n = 3, 66.7%),  NSCLC (n = 86, 36.0%), HCC and bladder 
cancer (n = 3 each, 33.3% each), and SCCHN (n = 22, 18.2%).   Study D4190C00007: Of the [ADDRESS_255674] astic syndrome (MDS) treated in

 Fixed Dosing   
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
17 A population PK model was developed for durvalu mab using monotherapy data from a Phase 1 
study ( study 1108; N=292; doses= 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg Q3W; solid tumors ). 
Population PK analysis indicate d only minor impact of body weight (WT) on PK of durvalumab 
(coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body WT-based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing (750 mg 
Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by [CONTACT_213178] (5th, 
median and 95th percentiles) using the population PK  model. A fixed dose of 750 mg was 
selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body WT of ~75 kg). A total of 1000 
patients were simulated using body WT distribution of 40–[ADDRESS_255676] been repor ted by [CONTACT_2312] (Ng et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 
2012; Narwal et al. 2013). Wa ng and colleagues investigated  [ADDRESS_255677] 
variability in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodyna mics parameters [Z hang et al. 2012].  
 A fixed dosing approach is preferred by [CONTACT_213179]. Given expectation of si milar pharmacokinetic e xposure and variability, 
we considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosin g regimens. Based on average body WT of 75 
kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab (equiva lent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) is included in the 
current study. Fixed dosing of durvalumab is  recommended only for subjects with > 30kg body 
weight due to endotoxin exposure.   Patients with a body weight less than or equal to 30 kg 
should be dosed using a weight-bas ed dosing schedule (Appendix C).  
 2.3 Rationale 
 In an ongoing Phase 1/2, multicente r, open-label study evaluating the safety and clinical efficacy 
of the PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab 10 mg /kg IV every 2 weeks in patients with 
multiple solid tumor types including NSCLC, the ORR in NSCLC was 14% (23% in patients with PD-L1+ tumors by [CONTACT_200003]263Ventana PD-L [ADDRESS_255678]), and the disease 
control rate (DCR) at 24 weeks was 24% (Rizvi  et al. 2015). ORR wa s higher in squamous 
(21%) than in non-squamous patients (10%), an d responses were durable. Drug-related adverse 
events (AEs) were reported in 48% of patien ts and were most freque ntly fatigue (14%), 
decreased appetite (9%), and nausea (8%). Grade ≥ 3 drug-related AEs were reported in 6% of 
patients.  Recently, several phase I/II clinical tr ials have evaluated th e clinical activity of 
monotherapy with PD1 and PD-L1 blocking antibodi es in the 1st line treatment of advanced 
NSCLC.  These clinical trials indicate early evidence of durable antitumor activity  with response 
rates of 23-29% and tolerable toxici ty profiles similar to what has been previously demonstrated.  
There are currently several ongoing randomized phase III clinical trials evaluating PD1 and PD-
L1 blocking antibodies in the 1st line treatment of advanced NSCLC.  MYSTIC is a phase III 
open-label study of 1st line durvalumab (20 mg /kg IV every 4 weeks) with or without a 
monoclonal antibody to CTLA-4, tremelimumab (1 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses), 
vs. standard of care chemotherapy in advanced  NSCLC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED].)  Nota bly, this clinical

18 trial is being conducted in patients with an  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status of 0 or 1.  An ECOG performance status of 2 (PS2) is defi ned as being “ambulatory and capable of all self-
care but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about mo re than 50% of waking hours” 
(Oken et al. 1982). Up to 30 to 40% lung cancer pa tients present with an ECOG PS2 (Buccheri et 
al. 1996; Lilenbaum 2006).  Performance status has long been recognized as an independent 
prognostic factor for survival, t hus patients with a PS2 have typi[INVESTIGATOR_213150] (Stanley 1980; Brundage et al. 2002).  More recent phase II and III clinical studies dedicated to defining the optimal therapeutic strategy in PS2 patients have 
demonstrated a significant survival advantage with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy over 
single agent therapy with pemetrexed , paclitaxel or erlotinib in th e 1st line treatment of advanced 
NSCLC (Lilenbaum et al. 2005; L ilenbaum et al. 2008; Zukin et al . 2013).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_213151], 
platinum-based therapy in NSCLC patients with  marginal performance status has not been 
universally adopted due to the pe rceived burden of excess toxicity associated with therapy (West 
2013).     This is a single-arm phase II clinical trial ev aluating the safety and efficacy of the PD-L1 
inhibitor durvalumab as first- line therapy in 50 patients with  advanced NSCLC and ECOG PS2. 
We hypothesize that PD-L1 inhibition with durvalu mab is a safe and tolerable regimen and 
associated with a survival advantage in PS2 patie nts with advanced NSCLC.  The results of this 
clinical study may reframe the treatment paradi gm of advanced NSCLC patients with a PS2 to 
focus on immune modulation.    3. PATIENT SELECTION

containing 0.9% (w/v) saline or 5% (w/v)dextr ose for IV infusion with a final durvalumab 
concentration ranging from 1 to 20 mg/mL, and deliv ered through an IV ad ministration set with 
a 0.2- or 0.22- μm in-line filter.  
 Remove a volume of IV solution from the IV bag equal to the calculated volume of durvalumab to be added to the IV bag prio r to addition of durvalumab.  Next, the volume of durvalumab (i.e., 
30.0 mL for 1500 mg of durvalumab) is added to the IV bag such that final concentration is 
within 1 to 20 mg/mL (IV bag volumes 100 to 1000 mL).  Mix the bag by [CONTACT_213181].  Patient weight at baseline  should be used for dosing calculations in patients ≤30 kg unless there 
is a ≥10% change in weight.  Dosing  day weight can be used for dosing calculations instead of 
baseline weight per inst itutional standard.   
 For patients <30kg, Calculate the dose volume of durvalumab and num ber of vials needed for the 
subject to achieve the accurate  dose according to Appendix C. 
 Durvalumab will be administered at room temperature (approximately 25°C) by [CONTACT_62655] a peripheral or central vein. Following preparation of 
durvalumab,  the entire contents of the IV bag should be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 60 minutes (±5 minutes), using a 0.2, or 0.22- μm in-line filter. Less than 55 
minutes is considered a deviation.  
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
27 The IV line will be flushed with a volume of IV solution (0.9% [w /v] saline) equal to the priming 
volume of the infusion set used after the conten ts of the IV bag are fully administered, or 
complete the infusion according to institutional polic y to ensure the full dose is administered and 
document if the line  was not flushed. 
 Standard infusion time is 1 hour.  However, if there are interr uptions during infusion, the total 
allowed time should not exceed 8 ho urs at room temperature.  Th e table below summarizes time 
allowances and temperatures.  Durvalumab hold and infusion times

includin g interruptions [ADDRESS_255692] of care or as clinically indicated, as noted in the Schedule of 
Assessment. Subjects are monito red (pulse rate, blood pressure ) every 30 minutes during the 
infusion period (including times where infusi on rate is slowed or temporarily stopped). 
 In the event of a ≤ Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, th e infusion rate of study drug may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to  4 hours) and re-initiated at 
50% of the initial rate until completion  of the infusion.  For subjects with a ≤ Grade 2 
infusion-related reacti on, subsequent infusions ma y be administered at 50 % of the initial rate.  
Acetaminophen and/or an antihis tamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) or  equivalent medications per 
institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.  If the 
infusion-related reaction is Grade [ADDRESS_255693] infusion time is one hour, however if there are interr uptions during infusion, the total 
allowed time from infusion start to completion of infusion should not exceed 4 hours at room 
temperature, with maximum total time at room temperature not exceeding 4 hours (otherwise requires new infusion preparation).    As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible.  Appropriate drugs 
and medical equipment to treat acu te anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and 
study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxi s.  The study site must have 
immediate access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in additi on to the ability to 
admit subjects to an intensive care unit if necessary.  6.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines 
 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
28 Investigators may prescribe concomitant me dications or treatmen ts (e.g., acetaminophen, 
diphenhydramine) deemed necessary to provide adequate prophylactic or supportive care except for those medications identified as  “excluded” as listed below. 
 Excluded Concomitant Medications  The following medications are consider ed exclusionary during the study.  
1. Any investigational anticancer  therapy other than the pr otocol specified therapy. 
2. Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except palliative radiotherapy), immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment. Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer related conditions (e .g., insulin for diabetes and hormone 
replacement therapy) is acceptable.  NOTE: Local treatment of isolated lesions for 
palliative intent is acceptable (e.g., by [CONTACT_72971]). 
3. Immunosuppressive medications including, but not limited to sy stemic corticosteroids at 
doses not exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, methotrexate, azathioprine, 
and TNF- α blockers. Use of immunosuppressive medications for the management of 
investigational product-re lated AEs or in subjects with cont rast allergies is acceptable. In 
addition, use of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids is permitted. A temporary period of steroids will be allowed for different indications, at the discretion of the principal 
investigator (e.g., chronic obstructive pulm onary disease, radi ation, nausea, etc). 
4. Live attenuated vaccines within 30 days of durvalumab dosing (ie, [ADDRESS_255694] discontinuation of 
durvalumab.  Inactivated vaccines, such as  the injectable influenza vaccine, are 
permitted. 
 
Rescue Medications 
Rescue/supportive medication/class of drug: Usage: 
Concomitant medications or treatments (eg, acetaminophen or diphenhydramine) deemed necessary by [CONTACT_213182], except for those medications identified as “prohibited” as listed above To be administered as prescribed by [CONTACT_122924] (including antibiotics, nutritional support, growth factor support, correction of metabolic disorders, optimal symptom control, and pain management [includin
g palliative radiotherap y, etc]) Should be used when necessary for all patients 
 Contraception  Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilised male partner must 
use 2 methods of effective contraception (see belo w)  from screening, and  for at least [ADDRESS_255695] infusion of durvalumab; cessation of birth contro l after this point should be

29 discussed with a responsible physician.  Peri odic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the 
withdrawal method are not acceptabl e methods of birth control. 
 
 Females of childbearing potential  are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (i.e., 
bilateral tubal ligation, b ilateral oophorectomy, or comp lete hysterectomy) or 
postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no me nses without an altern ative medical cause). 
 Nonsterilised males who are sexually active with  a female partner of childbearing potential 
must use 2 acceptable methods of effective cont raception (see below) from screening and for 
[ADDRESS_255696]. 
    
Effective methods of contracepti on (two methods must be used)

Diaphragm plus spermicide  Levonorgestrel-releasing 
intrauterine system (e.g., Mirena®)a Combined pi[INVESTIGATOR_213154] 
a This is also considered a hormonal method. 
 Blood donation  Subjects should not donate blood while participat ing in this study and for at least [ADDRESS_255697]-L questionnaires in clinic at the followin g times: at baseline, prio r to the start of each 
cycle, and at the end of therapy.   Research staff should instruct th e patient how to properly fill in  the FACT-L questionnaire per 
the following instructions:  
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
30  All questionnaires must be completed prior to any other study procedures (baseline 
following informed consent) and before disc ussion of current dise ase status to avoid 
biasing the patient’s resp onses to the questions. 
 Provide a private environment for th e patient to answer the questions. 
 Provide sufficient time for the patient to complete the questionnaire at their own pace. 
 Avoid assistance from relatives, friends or cl inic staff to help the patient answer the 
questionnaires. However, if the patient is unable to read the questionnaire (due to 
vision impairment such as  blindness or uncorrected  vision, illiteracy), the 
questionnaires may be read out loud by [CONTACT_213183]. 
 When the patient completes th e questionnaire, it should be handed back to the person 
responsible for the questionnaires, checking for completeness prio r to initiating any 
other procedures. 
 Only one answer should be r ecorded for ea ch question. 
 6.4 Duration of Therapy 
 Treatment may continue for up to 12 months (m aximum 12 doses) or until one of the criteria for 
durvalumab discontinuation is met.  Permanent discontinuation of durvalumab 
  
An individual subject will not r eceive any further investigationa l product if any of the following 
occur in the subject in question: 
 Confirmation of PD and investigator dete rmination that the subject is no longer 
benefiting from treatme nt with durvalumab  
  
 Withdrawal of consent or lost to follow-up 
 Adverse event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] i nvestigator or the sp onsor, contraindicates 
further dosing 
 Subject is determined to ha ve met one or more of the exclusion criteria for study 
participation at study entry and continuing investigational therapy might constitute a 
safety risk 
 Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant 
 Any AE that meets criteria for discon tinuation as defined in Appendix D. 
 Grade ≥ 3 infusion reaction 
 Subject noncompliance that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335], warrants 
withdrawal; eg, refusal to a dhere to scheduled visits 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
31  Initiation of alternative anticancer thera py including another i nvestigational agent 
Subjects who are permanently di scontinued from further receipt of investigational product, 
regardless of the reason (withdrawal  of consent, due to an AE, other), will be identified as 
having permanently discontinued treatment.  
 
Subjects who are permanently discontinued fro m receiving investigat ional product will be 
followed for safety per Appendix E or F, unless c onsent is withdrawn or th e subject is lost to 
follow-up or enrolled in another clinical study.  All subjects will be followed for survival.  
Subjects who decline to return to the site for evaluations wi ll be offered follow-up by [CONTACT_213184] 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, [ADDRESS_255698]. Patients discontinuing study therapy for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed at least until resolution or st abilization of the adverse event (Appendix E). 
 At the discretion of the sponso r-investigator (or sponsor/investig ator) the study may be closed 
prematurely.  6.[ADDRESS_255699] be 
documented in the Case Report Form.  7. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 For adverse events (AEs) that are considered at least partly due to administration of durvalumab, 
the following dose adjustment  guidance may be applied: 
 
 Treat each of the toxicities  with maximum supportive care (including holding the agent 
suspected of causing the toxicity where required). 
 If the symptoms promptly resolve with supporti ve care, consideration should be given to 
continuing the same dose of durvalumab al ong with appropriate continuing supportive 
care.  If medically appropriate, dose modifi cations are permitted for durvalumab (see 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
32 below). 
 All dose modifications should be  documented with clear r easoning and documentation of 
the approach taken. 
 In addition, there are certain circumstances in which durva lumab should be permanently 
discontinued. 
 
Following the first dose of durvalumab, subseque nt administration of durvalumab can be 
modified based on toxicities observed (Appendix D).    Based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab leading to T-cell  activation and proliferation, 
there is the possibility of obs erving immune related Adverse Ev ents (irAEs) during the conduct 
of this study.    Immune-mediated reactions/irAEs, also considered to be AESIs, are impor tant risks of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors, and are be ing closely monitored in clin ical studies with durvalumab 
monotherapy and combination therapy. irAEs observed with durvalumab include colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis/hepatotoxicity, neuropathy/neuromuscu lar toxicity, endocrinopathy, 
dermatitis, and nephritis. In additi on, pancreatitis is an important potential risk, particularly with 
durvalumab and tremelimumab combination therapy.  Other inflammatory responses with potenti al immune-mediated etiology reported with 
durvalumab and similar molecules include, but ar e not limited to, myocarditis, pericarditis, and 
uveitis. Subjects should be monito red for signs and symptoms of ir AEs.  In the absence of an 
alternate etiology (e.g., infection or PD) signs or symptoms of the above events of interests 
should be considered to be immune-related.   
 
 Dose modification recommendations and toxi city management guidelines for immune-
mediated reactions, for infusion-related reac tions, and for non-immune-mediated reactions 
are detailed in Tables 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_255700] (AESIs) are 
detailed in the IB version 9.0. All toxicities will be grad ed according to NCI CTCAE v4.03. 
 8. ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_213155]. 
 8.1 Safety parameters 
 8.1.1 Definition of adverse events 
 The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) E6 (R1) defines an AE as: 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/[ADDRESS_255701] a causal re lationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavor able and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
An AE includes but is not limited to any c linically significant worsening of a subject’s 
pre-existing condition. An abnormal laboratory finding that requires an action or intervention by 
[CONTACT_093], or a finding judged by [CONTACT_213185] a change beyond the range of 
normal physiologic fluctuation, shou ld be reported as an AE. 
Adverse events may be treatment emergent (i.e., occurring after in itial receipt of investigational 
product) or nontreatment emerge nt. A nontreatment-emergent AE is any new sign or symptom, 
disease, or other untoward medical event that begins after written informed consent has been obtained but before the subject has received investiga tional product.  
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or  surgery (that was scheduled prior to the 
subject being enrolled into th e study) for a docume nted pre-existing c ondition, that did not 
worsen from baseline, is not considered an AE  (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elective  procedure or routinely scheduled treatment 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs. 
8.1.2 Definition of serious adverse events 
 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring du ring any study phase (i.e., screening, run-in, 
treatment, wash-out, follow-up), at  any dose of the study drugs that fulfils one or more of the 
following criteria: 
 Results in death 
 Is immediately life-threatening 
 Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63995] g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital abnormality or birth de fect in offspring of the subject 
 Is an important medical event that may je opardize the patient or  may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed above. 
o Medical or scientific judgment should be  exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in th is situation. Examples of medically important events 
are intensive treatment in an emerge ncy room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; or de velopment of drug depe ndency or drug abuse. 
The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_093](s) and communicated to [COMPANY_008]. 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/[ADDRESS_255702] (ASEI) 
 An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is on e of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the Investiga tional Product and may require close monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_68477] . An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The 
rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in associat ion with the use of this  investigational product. 
AESIs for durvalumab include but are not limited to events with a potential inflammatory or immune-mediated mechanism and which may re quire more frequent monitoring and/or 
interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressa nts and/or hormone replacement therapy. These 
AESIs are being closely monitored in clinic al studies with durvalumab monotherapy and 
combination therapy. An immune-related adverse event (irAE) is defined as an adverse event that is associated with drug e xposure and is consistent with an  immune-mediate d mechanism of 
action and where there is no cl ear alternate etiology. Serologi c, immunologic, and histologic 
(biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an irAE diagno sis. Appropriate efforts 
should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectio us, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of 
the irAE.  
If the Investigator has a ny questions in regards to an adverse event (AE) being an irAE, the 
Investigator should promptly contact [CONTACT_38234]. 
AESIs observed with durvalumab include: 
 Colitis 
 Pneumonitis 
 ALT/AST increases / hepatitis / hepatotoxicity  
 Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxi city (i.e. events of encepha litis, peripheral motor and 
sensory neuropathies, Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia gravis) 
 Endocrinopathy (i.e. events of hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hyper- and 
hypothyroidism) 
 Dermatitis 
 Nephritis 
 Pancreatitis  (or labs suggestive of pancreatitis - increased  serum lipase , increased serum 
amylase)   
 Pemphigoid 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
35 Further information on these risks (e.g. presenting symptoms) can be  found in the current version 
of the durvalumab Investigator Brochure. More  specific guidelines fo r their evaluation and 
treatment are described in detail in Appendix D. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_255703]  for [COMPANY_008]/Medimmune, as pneumonitis has 
been reported with anti-PD-1 MAbs (Topalian et  al, NEJM 2012). Initial work-up should include 
high-resolution CT scan, ruling out infection, and pulse oximetr y. Pulmonary consultation is 
highly recommended.  
Guidelines for the management of subjects w ith immune-mediated even ts including pneumonitis 
are outlined in Appendix D. 8.1.[ADDRESS_255704] been reported with anti-PD-
L1 and anti-PD-1 therapy (Brahmer et al 2012). As  with the administration of any foreign protein 
and/or other biologic agents, reac tions following the infusion of MAbs can be caused by [CONTACT_62665], including acute anaphylactic (immunoglobulin E-me diated) and anaphylactoid 
reactions against the MAb, and se rum sickness. Acute allergic reactions may occur, may be 
severe, and may result in death. Acute alle rgic reactions may include hypotension, dyspnea, 
cyanosis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_213156] e, urticaria, pruritus, angi oedema, hypotonia, arthralgia, 
bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, fatigue, headache, hypertension, myalgia, vomiting and unresponsiveness. 
Guidelines for management of subjects with hy persensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) 
and infusion-related reactions are outlined in Appendix D. 8.1.6 Hepatic function abnormalities (hepatotoxicity) 
 
Increased transaminases have been reported during treatment with anti-PD-L1/anti-PD-1 
antibodies (Brahmer et al 2012).  Inflammatory hepatitis has b een reported in 3% to 9% of 
subjects treated with anti-C TLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).  The clinical 
manifestations of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]-treated subjects included general weakness , fatigue, nausea and/or 
mild fever and increased liver function tests such  as AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and/or 
total bilirubin. 
Hepatic function abnormality is de fined as any increase in ALT or AST to greater than 3 × ULN 
and concurrent  increase in total bilirubin to be greater  than 2 × ULN. Concurrent findings are 
those that derive from a single blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of 
each other. Follow-up investigations and i nquiries will be initiated promptly by [CONTACT_213186] e whether the findings are reproduc ible and/or whether there is 
objective evidence that cl early supports causation by a disease (e.g., cholelithiasis and bile duct 
obstruction with distended gallbladder) or an agent other than  the investigational product. 
Guidelines for management of subjects with hepatic function abnormality are outlined in Appendix D. 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/[ADDRESS_255705] or ALT ≥ 3xULN or total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to 
be reported as SAEs. These cases should be reported as SAEs if, after evaluation they meet the criteria for a Hy’s Law case or if any of the indi vidual liver test parameters  fulfill any of the SAE 
criteria. 
8.1.7 Gastrointestinal disorders 
 
Diarrhea/colitis is the most commonly observed treatment emergent SAE when tremelimumab is 
used as monotherapy.  In rare cases, colon perforation may occur th at requires surgery 
(colectomy) or can lead to a fatal outcome if not properly managed.  Gu idelines on management 
of diarrhea and colitis in patients receiv ing durvalumab are provided in Appendix D. 
 8.1.[ADDRESS_255706].  Mon itor for signs and symptoms that may be related to changes in 
renal function (e.g. routine urin alysis, elevated serum BUN and creatinine, decreased creatinine 
clearance, electrolyte imbalance,  decrease in urine output, proteinu ria, etc).  Patients should be 
thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternativ e etiology (e.g., disease progression, infections 
etc.)  Steroids should be considered in the absence of cl ear alternative etiol ogy even for low grade 
events (Grade 2), in order to pr event potential progression to highe r grade event.   Guidelines for 
the management of patients with immune-mediate d neurotoxic events ar e provided in Appendix 
D. 
Criteria for Hy’s Law (FDA Guidance 2009) 
 The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a hi gher incidence of 3-fold or 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/[ADDRESS_255707] than the (non- hepatotoxic) control drug or 
placebo  
 Among trial subjects showing such  aminotransferase el evations, often with aminotransferases 
much greater than [ADDRESS_255708], one or more also sh ow elevation of serum to tal bilirubin to >[ADDRESS_255709], without initial findings of cholesta sis (elevated serum al kaline phosphatase)  
 No other reason can be found to explain the co mbination of increased aminotransferases and 
total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre-existing or acu te liver disease; or 
another drug capable of causing the observed injury.   
8.[ADDRESS_255710] CAE should be made by 
[CONTACT_213187] 1 to 5 as 
defined below. 
Grade 1 (mild)  An event that is usua lly transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic interven tion. The event does not generally 
interfere with usual activities of daily living. 
 
Grade 2 (moderate)  An event that is usually alleviated with additi onal specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes wi th usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no signifi cant or permanent risk of harm to 
the subject. 
 
Grade 3 (severe)  An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the 
clinical status of the subject. 
 Grade 4 (life threatening) An event, and/or it s immediate sequelae, that is associated with 
an imminent risk of death or  with physical or mental disabilities that affect 
or limit the ability of the subject to perform activities of daily living 
(eating, ambulation, toileting, etc). 
 Grade 5 (fatal)  Death (loss of life) as a result of an event. 
  It is important to distinguish between serious cr iteria and severity of an AE. Severity is a 
measure of intensity whereas seriousness is de fined by [CONTACT_14540] 8.1.2. A Grade 3 
AE need not necessarily be considered an SAE.  For example, a Grade 3 headache that persists 
for several hours may not meet the regulatory definition of an SAE and would be considered a 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/[ADDRESS_255711], possible etiologies, and 
whether the event meets criteria of an SAE and therefore requires immediate notification to [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Patient Safety.  
The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) 
The date and time  when the AE started and stopped 
Changes in NCI CTCAE grade and the maximum CTC grade attained Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against durvalumab (yes or no)  Action taken with rega rd to durvalumab  
Outcome  In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs as applicable: 
Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date Investigator became aware of serious AE AE is serious due to <<criteria>> Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213157](s) 
 Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_255712] dose 
of durvalumab, throughout the trea tment period and including the follow-up period ([ADDRESS_255713] dose of durvalumab) or until the initiation of alternative anticancer therapy.  
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/[ADDRESS_255714]. Every effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all events, even if the events 
continue after discontin uation/study completion. 
If a subject discontinues from treatment for reasons other than disease progression, and therefore continues to have tumor assessments, drug or procedure-related SAEs must be captured until the patient is considered to have confirmed PD  and will have no further tumor assessments. 
The investigator is responsible for following all SAEs until resolution, until the subject returns to 
baseline status, or until the condition has stabil ized with the expectati on that it will remain 
chronic, even if this exte nds beyond study participation. 
Follow-up of unresolved adverse events 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last visit in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_213188], but wit hout further recording in the eCRF.  After 
[ADDRESS_255715]-related SAEs will continue to be 
followed for safety. [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune retains the right to requ est additional information for any subject with 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. Post study events 
 After the subject has been permanently withdrawn from the study, there is no obligation for the investigator to actively report information on new AE or SAEs occurring in former study 
subjects after the 90-day safety follow-up period for patients trea ted with durvalumab.  However, 
if an investigator learns of any SAEs, including death, at any time after the subject has been 
permanently withdrawn from study, and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event is related to study treat ment, the investigator shoul d notify the study sponsor and 
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Drug Safety.  8.3.[ADDRESS_255716], or to the study procedure(s)
. The reporting period for SAEs  is the period immediately 
following the time the fi rst dose of durvalumab is taken th rough [ADDRESS_255717] dose of 
durvalumab or until the initiati on of alternative anti cancer therapy.  The in vestigator and/or 
Sponsor are responsible for informing the Ethics  Committee and/or the Regulatory Authority of

Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease under 
study, the AE causing the death must be reported to as a SAE within 
24 hours  (see Section 8.3.2 for furthe r details).  The report should 
contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of progression of 
disease, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes 
of death.   
Deaths with an unknown cause should al ways be reported as a SAE.   
Deaths that occur following the protocol-defin ed 90-day post-last-dose of durvalumab safety 
follow-up period will be documented as events for survival analysis, but will not be reported as 
an SAE. 
8.3.4 Other events requiring reporting 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdose 
 An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose  of durvalumab in excess of that specified in 
the Investigator’s Brochure, unless ot herwise specified in this protocol. 
Any overdose of a study subject with durvalumab, with or wit hout associated AEs/SAEs, is 
required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the sponsor and [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Patient Safety or designee using the designated Safety e-mailbox (see 
Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_255721] informat ion). If the overdose results in an AE, the AE must also be 
recorded as an AE (see Section 8.3). Overdose does  not automatically make an AE serious, but if 
the consequences of the overdose are serious, fo r example death or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is 
serious and must be recorded a nd reported as an SAE (See Sec tion 8.3). There is currently no 
specific treatment in the event of  an overdose of durvalumab.  
The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic function abnormality 
 
Hepatic function abnormality (a s defined in Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_255722], with or without 
associated clinical manifestati ons, is required to be reported as “hepatic function abnormal” 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the sponsor and [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Patient 
Safety using the designated Safe ty e-mailbox (see Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_255723] information), unless a 
definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality  (e.g., cholelithiasis or bile duct obstruction) 
that is unrelated to investiga tional product has been confirmed. 
 If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnor mality has been established and is unrelated to 
investigational product, the decision to continue dosing of the study subject will be based on the 
clinical judgment of the investigator. 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
42  If no definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality is established, dosing of the study 
subject must be interrupted immediately. Follow- up investigations and inquiries must be initiated 
by [CONTACT_38238].  
Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be fo llowed by [CONTACT_62677]/MedImmune.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy 
 
Maternal exposure 
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course  of the study, the IPs should be discontinued 
immediately.   
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_213160] a contraceptive medi cation.  Congenita l abnormalities 
or birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective 
abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.   The outcome of all pregnancies 
(spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital 
abnormality) should be followed up  and documented even if the patient was discontinued from 
the study.   
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the stu dy, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
should inform the appropriate [COMPANY_008] repres entatives within [ADDRESS_255724] dose of durvalumab m onotherapy.   
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarri age, elective termin ation, ectopic pregna ncy, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) occurring from  the date of the first dose unt il [ADDRESS_255725] obtain the c onsent of the patient’s partner.  Therefore, the local study team 
should adopt the generic ICF template  in line with local procedures and submit it to  the relevant 
Ethics Committees (ECs)/Institutional Re view Boards (IRBs) prior to use.

 9.1 Durvalumab  
The Pharmaceutical Development R & D S upply Chain Management section of  
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune will supply  durvalumab to  the investigator as a 500-mg vial solution 
for infusion after dilution. 
 
9.1.1 Formulation/packaging/storage  
Durvalumab will be supplied by [CONTACT_62653]  a 500 mg vial solution for infusion after 
dilution. The solution contains 50 mg/mL durvaluma b, 26 mM histidine/histidine hydrochloride, 
275 mM trehalose dihydrate, and 0.02% (weight/volume) polysorbate 80; it has a pH of 6.0. The 
nominal fill volume is [ADDRESS_255726] ored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 
46°F) and must not be frozen. Du rvalumab must be used within the individually assigned expi[INVESTIGATOR_62609].  9.1.[ADDRESS_255727] of care analysis met hods in a CLIA certified lab. 
 Tumor tissue sample collection for PD-L1 testing  
 Samples should be collected via a core needle of 18 gauge or larger or be collected by [CONTACT_122925].  Wher e institutional practice uses a smaller gauge 
needle, samples should be evaluated for tu mor cell quantity (i.e. >100 tumor cells) to 
allow for adequate PD-L1 immunoh istochemistry analyses.   
 When the collection of a new sample is not clinically appropriate, archival samples may be utilized provided the speci men obtained is less than 3 years old.  When archival 
samples are used to assess PD-L1 status, the ag e of the sample / date of collection should 
be captured.   
 Samples submitted for PD-L1 testing should be formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin.  
Samples from fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] (FNA) or decalcified bone are not appropriate for PD-L1 analysis. Samples taken from malignant pleural effusions or other appropriate

The confirmatory scan is acquired preferably at th e next regularly scheduled imaging visit and no earlier than 4 
weeks after the prior assessment of PD.
 
    
  
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/[ADDRESS_255731] – Solid Tumors 
 For the purposes of this study, patients s hould be re-evaluated for response every 8  weeks. In 
addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scan s should also be obtaine d not less than 4 weeks 
following initial documentati on of objective response. 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_182655] (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009]. Changes in the la rgest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesi ons and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  12.1.[ADDRESS_255732] their response classified according to the definitions  stated below. (Note:  Patients who exhibit 
objective disease progression pr ior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.)  Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response. Patien ts who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable diseas e, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-eva luated will be considered 
evaluable for non-target disease. The res ponse assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progr ession of the lesions.  
 12.1.[ADDRESS_255733] one dimension (l ongest diameter to be recorded) as ≥[ADDRESS_255734] 
x-ray or as ≥[ADDRESS_255735] be recorded in millime ters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a prev iously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable.  
 Malignant lymph nodes. To be considered pathologically enlarged  and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_255736] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At ba seline and in follow-up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
48  Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or site s of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cu tis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_213189]), are considered as non-measurable. 
 Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteri a for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions  (neither measurable  nor non-measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to repr esent cystic metastases can be  considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the de finition of measurability desc ribed above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions w ith the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves  to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on o ccasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in  which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be  selected. A sum of the di ameters (longest for non-nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal le sions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in th e sum, then only the 
short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objectiv e tumor regression in the me asurable dimension of the 
disease.  Non-target lesions. All other lesions (or si tes of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target  lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at ba seline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
 12.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of  Measurable Disease 
 All measurements should be taken and reco rded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers. All baseline evaluations should be  performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than  4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at ba seline and during follow-up. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferre d to evaluation by [CONTACT_213190](s) being 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
49 followed cannot be imaged but ar e assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will onl y be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules). In the case of  skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estima te the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 Chest x-ray   Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as  measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
 Conventional CT and MRI  This guideline ha s defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice th ickness is [ADDRESS_255737] 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimu m size for a measurab le lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness. MRI is also  acceptable in certain situations (e.g.  for body 
scans).   Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent cont rast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acq uisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_182579], and measurement. Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is vari able globally. As with CT, if  an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease. Fu rthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequen ce. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters fo r all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type  of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as cl osely as possible to prior scans. Body scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 PET-CT  At present, the low dose or atte nuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal dia gnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements. However, if th e site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in  accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time. Note, however, that the PET portion of  the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
 Ultrasound  Ultrasound is not usef ul in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. Ultrasound exam inations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date  and, because they are operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same techni que and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next. If ne w lesions are identified by [CONTACT_213191], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about  radiation exposure 
at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances. 
 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
50 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such tech niques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtaine d or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 Tumor markers  Tumor markers alone cannot be  used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal li mit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical respons e. Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurr ent prostate cancer) have been published 
[JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 
2008]. In addition, the Gynecologic Can cer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_255738]-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 Cytology, Histology  These techniques can be  used to differentia te between partial 
responses (PR) and complete re sponses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tu mors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic  origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurab le tumor has met crite ria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between res ponse or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of th e treatment) and progressive disease. 
 FDG-PET  While FDG-PET response assessme nts need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-P ET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (par ticularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis 
of FDG-PET imaging can be identified acco rding to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a pos itive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive F DG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-
PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of  disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If 
the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not c onfirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT  scans are needed to  determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressi ng on the basis of the an atomic images, this 
is not PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnorma lity is thought to re present fibrosis or 
scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circ umstance should be prospectively described 
in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-spec ific medical literatu re for the indication. 
However, it must be acknowledged that bot h approaches may lead to false positive 
CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
 Note: A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surroundi ng tissue on the attenuation corrected image.

12.1.4 Response Criteria 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of  all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or  non-target) must have reduc tion in short axis to <10 
mm.  Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decreas e in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference th e smallest sum on st udy (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is th e smallest on study). In additi on to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolu te increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as refe rence the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesi ons and normalization 
of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patien t to be considered in co mplete clinical response. 
 Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of  one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump targ et lesion status. It must be  representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase. 
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_182580] d prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later tim e by [CONTACT_463] (or Investigator). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response  The best overall response is the best response recorded fro m the start of the treatment 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/2020 
52 until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements reco rded since the treatment st arted). The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the ach ievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Note: Patients with a global deterioration of h ealth status requiring di scontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progressi on at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (w hichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is  objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurem ents recorded since the treatment started). 
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is  measured from the start of the treatment until

 The investigator (i.e., the study site  principal investigator) will ma ke certain that an appropriate 
informed consent process is in place to ensure that potential research subjec ts, or their authorized 
representatives, are fully inform ed about the nature and objectiv es of the clinical study, the 
potential risks and benefits of study participation, and their ri ghts as research subjects. The 
investigator, or a sub-investigat or(s) designated by [CONTACT_456], will obtain the written, signed 
  
HCC #:16-054 
Version Date: 008/11/[ADDRESS_255745] ’s authorized representa tive, prior to performing 
any study-specific procedures on the subject. The date  and time that the subject, or the subject’s 
authorized representative, signs the informed cons ent form and a narrative of the issues discussed 
during the informed consent process will be doc umented in the subject’s case history. The 
investigator or sub-investigator will retain the original copy of the signed informed consent form, 
and a copy will be provided to the subject, or to the subject’s authorized representative.  The investigator will make certain  that appropriate processes and procedures are in place to 
ensure that ongoing questions and concerns of enrolled subjects  are adequately addressed and 
that the subjects are informed of any new informa tion that may affect thei r decision to continue 
participation in the clinic al study. In the event of substantial ch anges to the clinical study or the 
risk-to-benefit ratio of study participation, the in vestigator will obtain the informed consent of 
enrolled subjects for continued pa rticipation in the clin ical study.  When a reconsent is required, 
the lead study coordinator will no tify all sub-investigators and st udy coordinators via email that a 
reconsent is needed. The email notification will also list the changes in the new consent and 
specify which patients need to be reconsented.  14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 14.[ADDRESS_255746] line treatment of advanced 
NSCLC with ECOG PS2 (Lilenbaum et al. 2005; Lilenbaum et al . 2008; Zukin et al. 2013), it 
has not been universally adopted due to the perceived burden of ex cess toxicity associated with 
therapy (West 2013).   Our study investigates a possi ble therapy to address the unmet need of an 
effective, tolerable first-line therapy for the large population of advanced  NSCLC patients with 
PS2. Durvalumab is in the class of PD-L1 m onoclonal antibodies that have yielded durable 
responses in a sizeable minority of patients, without the side e ffects of a platinum doublet.  A 
single-arm trial is appropriate given the development stage of durvalumab and the incremental steps required toward staging a much larger tr ial, such as to asse ss noninferiority with a 
platinum-based doublet.  The tria ls cited above in this patient  population establish benchmarks 
for reasonable and unreasonable efficacy and toxicity.  Prior phase II/III clinical trials  have demonstrated a median OS  of about 5 months with single 
agent therapy in PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC (Lilenbaum et al. 2005; Lilenbaum et al. 
2008; Zukin et al. 2013).   A medi an OS of 9 months with durv alumab (approximately the level 
achieved by [CONTACT_213194]-based doublets in these trials) woul d demonstrate a clinically 
meaningful improvement over the hi storical control median OS of 5 months with single agent 
therapy.  Assuming 18 months of accrual with 6 months of follo w-up, N=[ADDRESS_255747] 85% power for a 90% confidence interval for median survival to exclude 5 months (and

as described in Section 8.3.2, but will  not be part of study summaries.) 
 The primary efficacy cohort may exclude patients who withdraw from study therapy prior to the 
second cycle for reasons unrelated to disease prog ression or toxicity.  Exam ples include patients 
who withdraw due to concerns about insurance c overage, or reluctance to travel an additional 
distance for study par ticipation.  However, these patients will  be followed for overall survival if 
they do not withdraw consent, and will be included  in a sensitivity analysis of efficacy endpoints 
for the full safety cohort.  14.3 Analysis plan 
 Summary tables describing the patient cohort will be co mpi[INVESTIGATOR_42602], including: 
 Demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, smoking history, re cent weight loss) 
 Disease history (current stag e, tumor sites, histology) 
 Comorbidities at start of ther apy (cardiac, pul monary, other) 
 PD-L1 expression status 
 Analysis of primary endpoints:  
 The OS curve, median OS, and a 90% confid ence interval for the median OS will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_10062] (the Ka plan-Meier method fo r survival, and the 
Greenwood variance formula applied to log-transformed survival ) in the efficacy cohort 
(primary analysis) and safety cohort (sen sitivity analysis).  Durvalumab will be 
considered a promising therapy in this populatio n if the estimated medi an OS is 9 months 
or greater, and/or th e lower bound of a 90% confidence in terval for the median OS is 
greater than 5 months.  However, these results will be interpreted in the context of safety 
data and the presence of durable respons es attributed to study therapy.).   
 All adverse events that are determined to be  possibly, probably or definitely related to 
treatment will be tabulated according to grad e and type, in order of frequency in the 
safety cohort. Each adverse event will be c ounted only once per patient, with the highest 
grade recorded. Serious adverse events and a dverse events of speci al interest (ASEI, 
defined in section 8.1.3) will also be tabulated  by [CONTACT_35043]. Listings will be provided for 
all on-study deaths and a dverse events that lead to withdrawal from study.  
 Lilenbaum et al (2008) ob served a rate of grade ≥ 3 adverse events of  41% (90% CI 31%-
53%) for a platinum-based doubl et, and 27% (90% CI 18%-38%) for erlotini b. In this 
context of balancing exp ected toxicity and effi cacy, a rate of grade ≥3 treatment related 
adverse events of 30% or less would be acceptabl e, especially if associated with efficacy 
in individuals.  In a cohort of n=50, a 30% rate of grade ≥[ADDRESS_255749] a 
90% CI of (21%-41%), demonstrating it is likely more tole
rable than the platinum 
doublet.

58  PFS will be evaluated using the same met hodology as for OS.  PFS and OS will be 
evaluated in the unselected populations and based on PD-L1 status.  The ORR and OS12 
will be estimated with a 90% Wilson Score confidence interval, for the unselected 
population and based on PD-L1 status. HRQL at baseline, the end of each cycle, and at the end of therapy will be assessed using the FACT-L questionnaire (David Cella, Ph.D., 
2007).  Total scores and subscales will be summarized for each patient, and analyzed 
using standard linear mixed m odels methods and generalized estimating equations.   The 
primary analysis will summarize baseline QOL, average changes over the first two cycles 
of treatment, and average QOL in survivor s at approximately 6 months and 12 months.

APPENDIX C: DURVALUMAB DOSE CALCULATIONS  
Durvalumab Dosing 
The durvalumab dosing should be done depending on subject wei ght (if subject is < 30kg): 
1. Cohort dose: X mg/kg 2. Subject weight: Y kg 
3. Dose for subject: XY mg = X (mg/kg) × Y (kg) 
4. Dose to be added into infusion bag:  
Dose (mL) = XY mg / 50 (mg/mL)  
where 50 mg/mL is durvalumab nominal concentration  
The corresponding volume of durvalumab should be rounded to the nearest tenth mL (0.1 mL). 
 Dose adjustments for each cycle only needed for greater than 10% change in weight. 5. The theoretical number of vials requi red for dose preparation is the ne xt greatest whole number of vials 
from the following formula: Number of vials = Dose (mL) / 10 (mL/vial) 
Example:  
1. Cohort dose: 10 mg/kg 
2. Subject weight: [ADDRESS_255752]: 300 mg = 10 (mg/kg) × 30 (kg) 
4. Dose to be added into infusion bag:  
Dose (mL) = 300 mg / 50 (mg/mL) = 6.0 mL 
5. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation:  
Number of vials = 6.0 (mL) / 10.0 (mL/vial) = 1 vials

Immune-mediated peripheral 
neuromotor 
syndromes, such as Guillain-Barre and Myasthenia Gravis  Any Grade - The prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes is important, since 
certain patients may unpredictably 
experience acute decompensations which can result in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms which may predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27567], and signs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y insufficiency or 
autonomic instability 
- Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes and medications, etc.). It should be noted that the diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes can be particularly challenging in patients with underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis. Given the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a low threshold to obtain a neurological consult

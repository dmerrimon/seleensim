Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 1Estimands:
Not applicable.
Study Population:
This study will enroll male and female participants (18 to 60 years of age, inclusive) who have at 
least [ADDRESS_473395] 90 days.
Number of Participants:
Approximately [ADDRESS_473396] 18 participants.   An attempt 
will be made to enroll 1female participant for every 3 male participants.
Study Design Overview:
This will be a randomized, participant -and investigator -blinded, placebo -controlled, single 
sequence study comprising of male and female recreational opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -using participants.
Participants will be screened for up to [ADDRESS_473397] administration.  
Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 and will be residential for a 
single period of 17 days/16 nights.  After randomization, participants will receive multiple oral 
doses of ASP8062 or placebo (2:1 ratio) on days 1 through 10.  On day 10, all participants will also 
receive a single oral dose of morphine immediately after the ASP8062 or placebo dose followed by 
a 144 -hour in -house blood sampling period.  S cheduled safety and tolerability assessments will be 
conducted as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments [ Table 1].  Participants are to remain 
awake, seated or semirecumbent and avoid lying on either the left or right side for at least [ADDRESS_473398] been performed and that there are no medical reasons 
for a longer stay in the clinical unit.
The study will be completed with an end -of-study visit (ESV).  The ESV will tak e place 5 to 9 days 
after the day 16 pharmacokinetic sample is collected or at early discontinuation/termination from 
the study.

Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 12 INTRODUCTION
2.1 Study Rationale
An in vitro cy tochrome P450 (CYP) identification study  suggested that ASP8062 is mainly  
metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4, while morphine shows no inhibitory  effect on CYP3A in an in vitro 
study  [Haazet al, 1 998].  Morphine is metabolized by  [CONTACT_378206] -glucuronosy ltransferases 
[De Gregori et al, 2012; Sato et al, 2012; Court et al, 2003; Projean et al, 2003].  Therefore, 
the pharmacokinetic drug -drug interaction (DDI) potential of ASP8062 with opi[INVESTIGATOR_378168].  Potential interaction such as opi[INVESTIGATOR_378169] y possible because both ASP8062 and opi[INVESTIGATOR_378170] [Pattinson, 
2008].
For future studies in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) patients, ASP8062 will be coadministered with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], including standard medication -assisted treatments such as buprenorphine/naloxone.  
Among opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328], the µ -receptor is considered to play  a role in the decrease in the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_378171], resulting in a decreased stimulus to breathe and the 
development of apnea [Schiller & Mechanic, 2019].  ASP8062 has not been observed to 
directly  interact with opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736] [study  8062 -PH-9005] and the preclinical DDI stud y 
[study  8062 -PH-9055] between ASP8062 and morphine, a full agonist for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] µ -receptor, 
failed to find an y pharmacodynamic (i.e., respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]) interaction including general 
condition.  This clinical DDI/safety  study  will provide relevant safet y (particularly for 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2477] ), tolerability  and pharmacokinetic data in order to assess the potential 
risk of ASP8062 coadministered with morphine, a full agonist for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] µ -receptor to support 
future studies in this patient population.  The study was designed particularly  to inves tigate if 
ASP8062 has any  additive effect on top of morphine by  [CONTACT_378207] (CO 2), using a single morphine dose slightl y above the highest approved 
individual morphine dose, but presumably  still allowing ro om to detect potential additive 
effects of ASP8062.
2.2 Back ground
ASP8062 is a novel compound with positive allosteric modulator (PAM) activity  on the 
gamma -aminobuty ric acid ty peB (GABA B) receptor that is intended for oral administration 
and is currentl y being developed for the treatment of OUD and alcohol use disorder.  
ASP8062 is a cry stal, which is practicall y insoluble in water and slightl y soluble in ethanol.
An estimated 2.1 million Americans had an OUD in 2017 [Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Servic es Administration, 2018].  Overdose deaths due to opi[INVESTIGATOR_224758] [ZIP_CODE] in 2017 [Scholl et al, 2018].  National I nstitute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) data 
show that use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_224759] s yndrome [NIDA, 2019a] as well as 
the spread of infectious diseases like human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) and hepatitis 
[NIDA, 2019b].  Medication assisted treatment with buprenorphine (with or without 
naloxone), methadone or naltrexone is the current standard of care, and has resulte d in 
decreases in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], overdose deaths, criminal activity  and infectious disease transmission 
[Mattick et al, 2014; Schwartz et al, 2013; Mattick et al, 2009].  However, buprenorphine can 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_473406] to abuse and diversion and can 
cause respi[INVESTIGATOR_378172].  Buprenorphine’s ceiling effect may  limit its effectiveness in 
patients with ongoing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] [Bart, 2012].
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 5 (DSM -5) defines 
substance use disorders as a constellation of recurrent pathological cognitive, behavioral and 
physiological s ymptoms arising from the ongoing use of a substance.  The DSM -5 has 
combined the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 4 categories of 
substance abuse and substance dependence under the single heading of substance use 
disorders, which is classified by  [CONTACT_11370] y based on the number of s ymptom criteria (out of a 
total of 11) that are met: mild (2 to 3 criteria), moderate (4 to 5 criteria) and severe (more 
than 6 criteria) [Hasin et al, 2013].  Different drugs produce different effects on the user, but 
important shared features include a d ysregulation of brain reward pathway s and an overactive 
brain stress s ystem, which together reinforce use of the substance to achieve a pleasurable 
high, even if pursuing this high incurs great cost or negative consequences for the user.
Gamma -aminobut yricacid (GABA), the most abundant inhibitory  neurotransmitter, activates 
2types of receptors: ionotropic GABA ty pe A receptors [Olsen & Sieghart, 2008] and 
metabotropic GABA Breceptors [Bowery  et al, 2002].  Studies with GABAergic drugs and 
drugs of abuse h ave indicated that the GABA Breceptor mediates suppression of 
self-administration/craving across several drug modalities.  Drugs triggering abuse act b y 
enhancing dopamine release in the ventral tegmental, striatal, and prefrontal cortical areas of 
the bra in.  The effects of GABAergic compounds on decreasing drug self -administration and 
drug-seeking behavior act by  [CONTACT_224807] y or indirectly decreasing dopamine release in the 
aforementioned brain areas [Filip et al, 2015].
GABA Bagonists or PAMs have bee n found to attenuate opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -, alcohol -, cocaine -and 
nicotine -seeking behavior [Augier et al, 2017; Vlachou et al, 2011; Franklin et al, 2009; Filip 
& Frankowska, 2007; Paterson et al, 2004; Di Ciano & Everitt, 2003b; Di Ciano & Everitt, 
2003a] and also at tenuate the drugs of abuse -evoked changes during intracranial 
self-stimulation [Vlachou et al, 2011; Paterson et al, 2008; Slattery  et al, 2005].  However, 
activation of GABA Breceptors by  [CONTACT_224808], somnolence, excessive weakness, vertigo and cognitive impairment.  The 
sedative properties of baclofen limits its potential widespread therapeutic utility  [Dario & 
Tomei, 2004].  Accordingl y, activation of GABA Breceptors b y PAMs is one of the 
prioritized medication treatment approaches for NIDA in response to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8562] 
[Rasmussen et al, 2019].

Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 12.3 Risk /Benefit Assessment
2.3.[ADDRESS_473407].  Given the safet y profile of ASP8062 when administered to healthy 
participants, there appears to be relativel y minimal risk to participants taking a daily 25 mg 
oral dose.  The clinical unit has appropriate ly trained staff and required equipment available 
to treat participants presenting with both opi[INVESTIGATOR_378173] (AEs) including respi[INVESTIGATOR_2477].
The risks of morphine immediate -release tablets are well known.  R isks are mitigated in that 
only a single dose of morphine will be administered on day 10 following 10 consecutive 
daily  administrations of ASP8062 [Morphine Sulfate Package Insert].  Risks are also 
minimized because the participants are confined at a clini cal unit that has administered a 
range of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], including morphine.  Side effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_378174], central nervous sy stem depression and drowsiness, euphoria, feelings of 
relaxation, dependence, reduction of gastroin testinal motility , hepatitis with or without 
jaundice, allergic reactions, impairment in the ability  to drive, orthostatic hy potension, 
elevation of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_378175].
There is no expected benefit to the participan ts from the administration of morphine.
This will be the first study  where a multiple daily  oral dose of ASP8062 is administered in 
participants that will also be given morphine after the participants have reached near 
steady -state peak to trough exposures of ASP8062.  Risks are minimized by  [CONTACT_378208].  This study  is also being conducted after the 
initiation of the ph ase1b study  examining a single dose of ASP8062 (60 mg) in participants 
also administered buprenorphine -naloxone at doses/exposures consistent with OUD standard 
of care.  Continuous pulse oximetry  and capnography  for at least 8 hours will be employ ed on 
day10 when ASP8062 is given with morphine so that the potential for respi[INVESTIGATOR_378176], and appropriate medical treatment may  be given.  Participants will 
also be monitored b y experienced staff for signs of opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351].  Vital signs will be 
monitored daily  from day s9 to 16 and electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be monitored on 
day10 to detect potential cardiovascular s ymptoms several hours postdose.  AEs will be 
assessed dail y throughout the study .  Potential hepatic toxicit y will be monitored with clinical 
laboratory  testing on at least a daily  basis from days 10 to 16 of the investigational period.
2.3.2 Benefit Assessment
There is not expected to be a benefit from multiple consecutive daily  oral doses of ASP8062 
for 10 days in addition to a single oral dose of 45 mg morphine immediate -release tablets.
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_473408], 
participants might experience AEs related to ASP8062 or pr ocedural complications 
(e.g., blood draws, slight skin irritation from the adhesive on the ECG electrodes).
Overall, the risk associated with the participation of recreational opi[INVESTIGATOR_378177].

administration.  Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 and will be 
residential for a single period of 17 days/16 nights.  After randomization, participants will 
receive multiple oral doses of ASP8062 or placebo (2: 1ratio) on day s1 through 10.  On 
day10, all participants will also receive a single oral dose of morphine immediately  after the 
ASP8062 or placebo dose followed b y a 144 -hour in -house blood sampling period.  
Scheduled safety  and tolerability  assessments will be conducted as indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessments [ Table 1].  Participants are to remain awake, seated or semirecumbent and 
avoid ly ing on either the left or right side for at least [ADDRESS_473410] been performed and that there are no medical reasons for a longer 
stay in th e clinical unit.
The study  will be completed with an end -of-study  visit (ESV).  The ESV will take place 5 to 
9days after the day 16 pharmacokinetic sample is collected or at earl y 
discontinuation/termination from the study .
4.[ADDRESS_473411].  Participants will be randomized to treatment to reduce selection bias.  Participants 
and the investigator will both be blinded to treatment to reduce bias in the measurement of 
the primary  safet y endpoints.  Given the long p harmacokinetic t ½of ASP8062 (approximately  
60hours), a single sequence study  was chosen.
4.[ADDRESS_473412].  I n the 8062 -CL-0005 study , the AUCs of 30 mg ASP8062 with 
tablet B formulation (provided as a 30 mg tablet) were approximately  10% higher than 30 mg 
ASP8062 with tablet A formulation (provided as a 25 mg tablet plus a 5 mg tablet) with the 
90% CI within the standard bioequivalence limits (80.00, 125.00); C max was approximately  
60% higher.  With this finding, multiple doses of 25 mg ASP8062 with tablet B formulation 
will be proposed for future c linical studies for OUD.  The predicted exposures after multiple

Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 1doses of 25 mg ASP8062 are 1828 h•ng/mL for AUC 24and 143 ng/mL  for C max.  These 
exposures will be comparable to exposures in the previous clinical studies and will not 
exceed mean exposure l imit set in previous phase 1 studies (247 ng/mL for C max and 
2339 h•ng/mL for AUC 24); which means exposures achieved in this study  are expected to be 
pharmacologically  active (as seen in 8062 -CL-0003) and also safe and tolerated based on 
data from previous clinical studies in a total of [ADDRESS_473413] 
individual dose per package insert [Morphine Sulfate Package Insert].  This dose is 
equivalent to [ADDRESS_473414] 
individual dose and considered to be sufficient to show a sign of µ -receptor agonism.  C max
after a single dose of 45 mg morphine sulfate immediate -release tablet is exp ected to be close 
to the reported maximum serum morphine concentration after intramuscular administration of 
morphine chloride (0.15 mg/kg bod y weight) in which most participants showed depression

All predose procedures, e.g., 12 -lead ECG, vital signs and blood or urine sampling for 
clinical laboratory  tests, will be performed within 60 minutes prior to dosing.  All other 
measurements for 12 -lead ECG and vital signs, will be performed within 15 minutes of the 
nominal time point.  Pharmacokinetic sampling will be collected within 5 minutes from the 
nominal time point.
When time points for procedur es overlap, blood sampling for pharmacokinetics will be 
collected at the nominal time point.  Blood sampling for clinical laboratory  tests, 12 -lead 
ECG, vital signs (including SpO 2, if applicable), ARCI -49 and end tidal CO 2are to be 
collected before or after the nominal blood sampling for pharmacokinetics.
7.3 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in [Section 10.3.1 Appendix 3 Definition of 
Adverse Events and Section 10.3.3 Appendix 3 Definition of S erious Adverse Events], 
respectivel y.
AEs will be reported b y the participant (or, when appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or 
the participant’s legally  authorized representative).
The investigator and an y qualified designees are responsible for detect ing, documenting and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study  IP, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue the I P and/or study  [Section 10.3 Appendix 3 Adverse Events: 
Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up and Reporting].
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality  of AE and SAE and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in [Section 10.3

Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 17.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information
All SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the follow -upvisit at the time 
points specified in the Schedule of Assessments [ Table 1] and reported on the electronic data 
source.
All AEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the follow -up visit at the time 
points specified in the Schedule of Assessments [ Table 1] and reported on the electronic da ta 
source.
If the severity  of an AE/SAE changes, the event should be relisted on the electronic data 
source with the new severity  and new onset date.
If the severity  decreases, the AE/SAE should be relisted on the electronic data source with 
the new severi ty and new onset date.  The exception is ongoing predose events that continue 
postdose and improve postdose.  Such events should not be relisted.
If the severity  of an SAE reduces, the details of the AE should be provided on the SAE 
worksheet for the medic al assessor to be able to assess the course of the event.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in [Section 10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse 
Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up and Reporting ].  
The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being 
available.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AE or SAE after conclusion of the study  
participation.  However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y time 
after a participant has been discharged fr om the study , and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonabl y related to the study  IP or study  participation, the investigator must promptly  
notify  the sponsor.
7.3.2 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Care will be taken not to introdu ce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.
7.3.3 Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
After the initial AE/SAE report, the in vestigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs and AEs of special interest (as defined in 
[Section 7.3.[ADDRESS_473444]]) will be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as 
defined in [Section 8.3Lost to Follow -up]).  Further information on follow -up procedures is 
provided in [Section 10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for

Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 110.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedur es for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up and Reporting
10.3.1 Definition of Adverse Events
AE Definition:
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study  participant, 
temporally  associated with the use of study  IP, whether or not considered related to the study  
IP.
“Adverse event” means any  untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.
NOTE: an AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with the 
use of study  IP.  This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the 
(study ) procedures.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
●Any abnormal laborator y test results (hematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis) or 
other safet y assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (i.e., not related to progression of 
underly ing disease)
●Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition
●New conditions detected or di agnosed after stud y IP administration even though it may  
have been present before the start of the stud y
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
●Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_11009]’s condition
●The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition
●Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads 
to the procedure is the AE
●Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
conveni ence admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])
●Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_473469] result (e.g., hematology , biochemistry or urina lysis)or other 
safet y assessment (e.g., vital signs , phy sical examination or ECGs) , including those that 
worsen from baseline, that is considered to be clinically  significant in the medical and 
scientific judgment of the i nvestigator and not related to underl ying disease, is to be reported 
as an (S)AE.
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  finding or other abnormal safet y assessment ,
which is associated with the underl ying disease ,does not require reporting as an (S)AE, 
unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant ’s 
condition.
Repeating an abnormal laboratory  test or other safety  assessment, in the absence of any  of the 
above criteria, does not constitute an AE. Any abnorma l test result that is determined to be 
an error does not require reporting as an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential Cases of Drug -induced Liver Injury
Refer to [Section 10.4 Appendix 4: Liver Safet y Monitoring and Assessment] for detailed 
instructions on drug-induced liver injury . Abnormal values in AST and/or AL Tconcurrent 
or with abnorm al elevations in TBL that meet the criteria outlined in [Section 10.4
Appendix 4: Liver Safet y Monitoring and Assessment], in the absence of other causes of liver 
injury , are considered potential cases of drug -induced liver injury  (potential Hy ’s Law cases) 
and are alway s to be considered important medical events and reported per [Section 10.3.7
Appendix 3 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events].
10.3.[ADDRESS_473470] medical occurrence that, at any dose:
●Results in death
●Is life -threatening
oThe term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” ref ers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
●Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378189], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23917]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s 
office or outpatient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23918].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23919], 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary , the AE should be considered serious.
oHospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.

-CONFIDENTIAL - Clinical Study Protocol
30Jul2020 Astellas Page 61of 105
Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 1●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
oThe term disabilit y means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
oThis definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle), which may  interfere with or prevent 
every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
●Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
●Other situations:
oMedical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that 
may not be immediatel y life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217611].  These events should 
usually  be considered serious.
oExamples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency  room or at hom e for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse.
If an event is not an AE per definition in [Section 10.3.1 Appendix 3 Definition of Adverse 
Events], then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208509]/sy mptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression o f disease).
10.3.4 Assessment of Causality
●The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y IP and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
●A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence and/or 
arguments to sugges t a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
●The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
●Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y and other risk 
factors, as well as th e temporal relationship of the event to study  IP administration will 
be considered and investigated.
●The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
●For each AE/SAE, t he investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
●There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor.  However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.
●The investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality  assessment.
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol 8062 -CL-2002
-CONFIDENTIAL - Clinical Study Protocol
30Jul2020 Astellas Page 62of 105
Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 1●The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements.
Following a review of the relevant data, the caus al relationship between the I P and each 
(S)AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_49419] “y es” or “no” to the question “Do y ou consider that 
there is a reasonable possibility  that the event may have been caused by  [CONTACT_33249]?”
When making an assessment of causalit y, the fo llowing factors are to be considered when 
deciding if there is evidence and/or arguments to suggest there is a “reasonable possibility ” 
that an (S)AE may  have been caused by  [CONTACT_33249] (rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out) 
or if there is evidence to reasonabl y den y a causal relationship:
●Has the participant been administered I P?
●Plausibility  (i.e., could the event have been caused by  [CONTACT_331074]?  Consider biologic 
and/or pharmacologic mechanism, half -life, literature evidence, drug class, preclin ical 
and study  data, etc.)
●Dechallenge/dose reduction/rechallenge:
oDechallenge: did the (S)AE resolve or improve after only  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_224792] y treatment?
oDose reduction: did the (S)AE resolve or improve after reducing the dos e of the 
suspect drug?
oRechallenge: did the (S)AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped?
●Laboratory  or other test results: a specific laboratory  investigation supports the 
assessment of the relationship between the (S)AE and the IP (e.g., based on values pre -, 
during and post -treatment)
●Available alternative explanations independent of IP exposure; such as other 
concomitant drugs, past medical history , concurrent or underl ying disease, risk factors 
including medical and family  history , season, location, etc., and strength of the 
alternative explanation
●Temporal relationship between exposure to the IP and (S)AE onset and/or resolution. 
Did the (S)AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the 
IP?
●Finally , judging which are more likel y based on all the above contents, factors of 
reasonable possibility  or confounding factors, comprehensive judgment of plausible will 
be provided.
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investig ator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor.  While it is very  important that the 
investigator alway s assesses causalit y for every event before the initial transmission of the 
SAE data to the sponsor, the initial report sho uld be submitted without delay  (i.e., within 
24hours of awareness).  With limited or insufficient information about the event to make an 
informed medical judgment and in absence of any indication or evidence to establish a causal 
relationship, a causality assessment of “no” is to be considered.  In such instance, the 
investigator is expected to obtain additional information regarding the event as soon as

medically  qualif ied investigator may  revise his/her assessment of causality  in light of new 
information regarding the SAE and shall send an SAE follow -up report and update the 
electronic data source with the new information and updated causality  assessment.
10.3.5 Assessment of Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity  of each AE:
●Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
●Moderate: Affect normal dail y activities
●Severe: Inability  to perform dail y activities
10.3.6 Recording and Follow -up of AEs and/or SAEs
AE and SAE Recording
●When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory  reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.
●The investigator will t hen record all relevant AE/SAE information in the electronic data 
source .
●It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to the sponsor in lieu of completion of the electronic data source .
●There may  be in stances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_260050].  In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_147197].
●The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Follow -up of A Es and SAEs
●The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by  [CONTACT_215867]/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as poss ible.  This may  
include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
●New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed electronic data 
source .
●The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_473471] complete and submit an SAE worksheet containing all information that

10.3.8 Reporting Procedures for Special Situations
[IP_ADDRESS] Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy Information
If a female participant becomes pregnant during the study  dosing period or within 28 days 
from th e discontinuation of dosing, the investigator is to report the information to the sponsor 
according to the timelines in [Section 10.3.7 Appendix 3 Reporting Procedures for Serious 
Adverse Events] using the SAE worksheet as a special situation and i n the electronic data 
source .
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  female partner of a 
male participant who becomes pregna nt during the study  dosing period or within 90 days 
from the discontinuation of dosing and report the information to the sponsor according to the 
timelines in [Section 10.3.7 Appendix 3 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events] 
using the special situation worksheet or pregnancy  form.
The expected date of delivery  or expected date of the end of the pregnancy , last menstruation, 
estimated concept ion date, pregnancy  result and neonatal data, etc., should be included in this 
information.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  complication or 
termination (including elective termination) of a pregnancy  is to be reported for a female 
participant as an AE in the electronic data source or SAE per [Section 10.3.7 Appendix 3 
Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events].  Participant pregnancy  outcomes listed 
below are to be reported as SAEs:
●Spontaneous abortion /miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion
●Death of a newborn or infant within 1 month after birth is to be reported as an SAE 
regardless of its relationship with the I P
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it is to be r eported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the IP is judged as “possible ”by [CONTACT_1275]
●Congenital anomal y (including anomal y in miscarried fetus)
●Benign h ydatidiform mole
●Blighted ovum
Unless a congenital anomaly  is ide ntified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, the 
embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects by  [CONTACT_224832].  (S)AEs experienced b y the newborn/infant should be reported via the

Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 110.4 Appendix 4: Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment
The purpose of this appendix is t o provide guidance for the monitoring of drug -induced liver 
injury  during the course of the study .  It should be noted that this section does not specify  the 
end-of-study  anal yses of liver enzy mes.  An y participant enrolled in a stud y with active drug 
therapy and reveals an increase of serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3×ULN or bilirubin 
>2×ULN should undergo detailed testing for liver enzy mes (including at least AL P, ALT, 
AST and TBL).  Testing should be repeated within [ADDRESS_473476] TBL
Moderate > 3 ×ULN or > 2 ×ULN
Severe > 3 ×ULN and† > 2 ×ULN
ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; TBL: total bilirubin; ULN: upper limit of 
norm al
†Sam ples taken simultaneously or w ithin a maximum of 24hours.
In addition, the participant should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y 
of the following:
●ALT or AST > 8×ULN
●ALT or AST > 5×ULN for more than 2 weeks
●ALT or AST > 3×ULN and †TBL >2×ULN or international normalized r atio (INR) 
>1.5 (if INR testing is applicable/evaluated)
●ALT or AST > 5×ULN and† (TBL > 2×ULN in participants with liver metastases)
●ALT or AST > 3×ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)
†Samples taken simultaneously or within a maximum of 24 hours.
The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , 
physical examination an d clinical laboratory  tests.  The study  site personnel are to complete

Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 1the liver abnormalit y case report form (LA -CRF).   Participants with confirmed abnormal 
liver function testing should be followed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal liver function tests should be repeated 2 to 3 times weekly , 
and then weekly  or less if abnormalities stabilize or the I P has been discontinued and the 
participant is as ymptomatic.
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of a nother 
etiology , may  be considered an important medical event and may  be reported as an SAE.

Tofurther assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Sy mptoms 
and new -onset diseases are to be recorded as “AEs” within the electronic data sour ce.  
Illnesses and conditions such as h ypotensive events and decompensated cardiac disease 
that may  lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted.  Nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic participants and 
may be associated with fluctuating AT levels.  The investigator should ensure that the 
medical history  form captures any  illness that predates study  enrollment that may  be 
relevant in assessing hepatic function.
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (in cluding nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and 
special diets.  Medications are to be entered in the electronic data source.  Information on 
alcohol, other substance use and diet should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate 
document.
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
●Based on the participant’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including:
oAcute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious ag ents)
oUltrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease
oOther clinical laboratory  tests, including INR and direct bilirubin
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Treatment Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased liver function tests, such as viral hepatitis, 
pre-existing or acute liver disease, or exposure to other agents associated with liver inju ry, 
the participant may  be discontinued from study  treatment.  The investigator may  determine 
that it is not in the participant’s best interest to continue study  treatment.  Discontinuation of 
study  treatment should be considered if:
●ALT or AST > 8×ULN
●ALT or AST > 5×ULN for more than 2 weeks

2.Cases of increased TBL (at least 2 ×ULN) with concurrent AT elevations at least 
3×ULN and no evidence of intra -or extra -hepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated ALP) 
or Gilbert’s s yndrome [Temple, 2006].
FDA Guidance for Industry  titled, “Drug -induced Liver Injury : Premarketing Clinical 
Evaluation” issued b y the FDA on July 2009:
1.The drug causes hepatocellular injury , generally  shown by  a higher incidence of [ADDRESS_473477] than the (nonhepatotoxic ) control 
drug or placebo.
2.Among participants showing such AT elevations, often with ATs much greater than 
3×ULN, one or more also show elevation of serum TBL to > 2×ULN, without initial 
findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP).
3.No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased AT and TBL, such 
as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre -existing or acute liver disease; or another drug capable 
of causing the observed injury .

INTRODUCTION
PGx research aims to provide information regard ing how naturall y occurring differences in a 
participant’s gene and/or expression of genes based on genetic variation may impact what 
treatment options are best suited for the participant.  Through investigation of PGx by  
[CONTACT_77815][INVESTIGATOR_007], g ene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide 
Association studies, the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy , 
toxicity  or disease may  be better understood.  As many  diseases may  be influenced b y one or 
more genetic varia tions, PGx research may  identify  which genes are involved in determining 
the way  a participant may  or may  not respond to a drug.
OBJECTIVES
The PGx research that may  be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory .  The objective of t his research will be to anal yzeor determine genes of 
relevance to clinical response, pharmacokinetics and/or toxicity /safet y and/or disease.
By [CONTACT_77816], it may  be possible to predict an individual participant’s 
response to treatment i n terms of efficacy  and/or toxicity  and/or disease.
PARTICIPANT PARTICIP ATION
Participants who have consented to participate in this study  will participate in the PGx 
substudy .  Participants must provide written consent prior to providing an y blood samples
that may  be used at a later time for PGx analy sis.
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE
Participants who consent to participate in this substudy  will provide 4 mL sample of whole 
blood per Astellas’ instructions.  Each sample will be identified by  [CONTACT_378222]. Samples will be shipped to a designated banking CRO as directed by  [CONTACT_77818].
PGxANALYSIS
Details on the potential PGx analy sis cannot be established y et.  Astellas may  initiate the 
PGx analy sis if evidence suggests that genetic variants may be influencing the drug’s 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy  and/or safety and/or disease.
DISPOSAL OF PGx SAMPLES/DATA
All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 years following stud y 
database lock.  If there is no requirement for analysis, the whole blood sample will be 
destroy ed after the planned storage period.  The participant has the right to withdraw consent 
at an y time.  When a participant’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be 
destroy ed.  The results of any  PGx anal ysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal 
will be retained at Astellas indefinitely  unless otherwise specif ied b y local regulation .

Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 1Definition of Key Study Terms
Terms Definition of Terms
Baseline Assessments of participants as they enter a study before they receive any 
treatment.
Endpoint Variable that pertains to the efficacy or safety evaluations of a study.
Note: not all endpoints are themselves assessments since certain endpoints 
might apply to populations or emerge from analysis of results.  That is, 
endpoints might be facts about assessments (e.g., prolongation of survival).
Enroll To register or enter a participant into a study.  Note: once a participant has 
received the IP or placebo, the protocol applies to the participant. 
Investigational 
periodPeriod of time where major interests of protocol objectives are observed and 
where the test product or comparative drug (sometimes without 
randomization) is given to a participant and continues until the last 
assessment after completing administration of the test product or 
comparative drug.
Investigational 
productThe drug, device, therapy or process under investigation in a study that is 
believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study 
(e.g., health -related quality of life, efficacy, safety and pharmacoeconomics).
Randomization The process of assigning participants to treatment or control groups using an 
element of chance to determine assignmen ts in order to reduce bias.
Note: unequal randomization is used to allocate participants into groups at a 
differential rate; for example, [ADDRESS_473486] or comparative drug (sometimes without randomization) is given to 
a participant.
Study per iod Period of time from the first study site initiation date to the last study site 
completing the study.
Variable Any quantity that varies; any attribute, phenomenon or event that can have 
different qualitative or quantitative values.

Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 112 NONSUBSTANTIAL AMEND MENT 1
I.  The purpose of this amendment is:
Nonsubstantial Changes
1.Update screening language 
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Edit the rescreening language
RATIONALE:
To allow for the repeat of screening assessments within the screening window or to allow a 
subject to rescreen once for the study . Due to the nature of the participant population and 
the study  design, subject safet y and data integrit y will not be impacted.
2.Clarify inclusion and exclusion criteria
DES CRIPTION OF CHANGE:
Move exclusion criterion 18to the inclusion criteria and clarify  the CYP450 enzy mes that 
are excluded for exclusion criterion 1 9.
RATIONALE:
Previous exclusion 18should be answered affirmatively  in order for the subject to be 
eligible for participation; as a result, this exclusion should be listed as an inclusion. 
Exclusion 1 9excluded all inducers of metabolism; however, after consideration, it is only  
necessary  to exclude inducers of CYP 3A4. 
3.Clarify procedure for continuous end tidal CO 2
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Add clarification that subjects may  remove cannula to dose or eat.
RATIONALE:
The timepoints overlap for the collection of end tidal CO2 and it would not be possible for 
the subject to dose or eat with the can nula in place.
4.Lower the respi[INVESTIGATOR_378196] 2alarms
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
The alarm for respi[INVESTIGATOR_378197] 10 bpm and is now 6 bpm.

-CONFIDENTIAL - Clinical Study Protocol
30Jul2020 Astellas Page 102of 105
Version 1.1 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 1RATIONALE :
Generally , respi[INVESTIGATOR_378198] 6 and 10 are not clinically  relevant. A low respi[INVESTIGATOR_378199] 6 will allow a more accurate clinical determination of a true signal. 
5.Edit Spot CO 2respi[INVESTIGATOR_378200]:
The spot values are lowered to start at > 24, and continue with increments of 4 bpm: >28, 
>32, and >36.
RATIONALE :
This change is made to align with the protocol, Table 7,  alarm values.  
II.  Amendment summary of changes:
5.2 Exclusion Criteria #18 
WAS :
18. Participant must be willing to abstain from smoking (including use of tobacco -

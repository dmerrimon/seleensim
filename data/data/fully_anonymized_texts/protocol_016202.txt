Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/2021 Protocol Synopsis Title Clinical response to rhinovirus challenge in human asthmatics Short Title Clinical response to RV challenge in human asthmatics Clinical Phase Phase I clinical trial Number of Sites 1. University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA IND Sponsor/Number   Monica Lawrence, M.D., University of Virginia / IND [ZIP_CODE] Study Objectives We hypothesize that the immune responses generated in the nose of asthmatics underlie subsequent systemic modulation of the immune system, and that – in susceptible individuals (i.e., those with pre-existing asthma) – this modified nasal milieu is responsible for the asthma exacerbation. Primary Objective(s) 1. To determine whether RV increases expression of IL-25 transcripts by [CONTACT_868448][INVESTIGATOR_868359] (days 3 and 4). 2. To determine whether RV increases lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868360].  3. To determine whether asthmatics and allergic rhinitics will demonstrate an increased severity of infection in comparison to control subjects. Secondary Objective(s) 1. To determine whether asthmatic and AR cohorts demonstrate increased IL-25 transcript expression over the course of RV infection 2. To determine whether asthmatic and AR cohorts demonstrate increased expression of mRNA transcripts of a type 2 cytokine-inducing profile (IL-33 and TSLP). 3. To determine whether increased transcript expression of this type 2 cytokine-inducing profile can be corroborated as increased expression of protein. 4. To determine whether RV infection in the asthma cohort is associated with increases in biomarkers of inflammation. 
University of Virginia Confidential Page 4 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/2021 5. To determine whether increased severity of RV infection in the asthma and AR cohorts will be associated with more symptoms. 6. To determine whether increased severity of RV infection in the asthma and AR cohorts is related to decreased innate immunity. Study Design Open label single center study in asthmatics as well as allergic rhinitic and healthy controls.  All subjects will undergo GMP RV16 inoculation and responses will be compared between the 3 cohorts. Primary Endpoint(s) 1. RV-induced expression of IL-25 mRNA transcripts in the asthma and AR cohorts versus healthy controls as determined in nasal scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_868361] 3 and 4 (compared to day 0) as determined by [CONTACT_62865]. 2. RV-induced lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868362] (1) that will include cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and shortness of breath as well as via the asthma control test (ACT).   3. Severity of infection in the asthma and AR cohorts versus healthy controls as quantified by [CONTACT_868449] 1, 2, 3, 4, 7. Secondary Endpoint(s)  1. IL-25 transcript expression in nasal scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_868361] 1, 2, and 7 (as compared to day 0). 2. Expression by [CONTACT_868448][INVESTIGATOR_868363] a type [ADDRESS_1211661] inflammation will be determined as increases in circulating absolute eosinophil counts, increased FeNO, and as changes in methacholine PD20. 5. Severity of RV infection will be corroborated as increases in upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_868364] (1).

Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/2021 1. Background and Rationale  1.1. Background and Scientific Rationale Determining the mechanisms driving asthma exacerbations caused by [CONTACT_868454].  It is clear from our studies and others (3-5) that most children and adolescents who experience RV-induced asthma exacerbations are allergic and the presence of high titers of serum IgE antibody to relevant (environmentally present) allergens significantly increases the risk of wheezing with RV.  Thus, a surprising feature of RV asthma exacerbations is its tendency in temperate climates to primarily produce asthma exacerbations during particular seasons (September – with a subsidiary peak in May (6).  This “September epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]” has traditionally been ascribed to asthmatics returning to school but epi[INVESTIGATOR_868369] a modest seasonal increase in RV incidence in September (7) nor does this explain the surge in exacerbations in May.  Our studies support an alternative hypothesis, namely that seasonal exacerbations of asthma reflect sensitization to by[CONTACT_868455].  Thus, spring (May) RV-induced exacerbations will occur (and will only occur) in asthmatics sensitive to grass pollen, whereas autumn (September) exacerbations reflect sensitivity presumably to ragweed, dust mites, alternaria and other fall allergens (1).  We were able to confirm these concepts in our Costa Rica studies (3).  In this environment, where the primary allergen is perennial (dust mites) and there is no seasonality to either dust mite exposure nor – as in North America – is there a seasonality to RV infection, there was no seasonal predilection for RV to induce an asthma exacerbation.  Even more compelling was the observation that dust mite sensitization was virtually always present in asthmatics who exacerbated to RV and that with sufficient sensitization, an exacerbation was virtually guaranteed (3). Our published data demonstrate evidence of a type 2 cytokine signature [CONTACT_868496].  This is associated with both increased recruitment into nasal secretions of eosinophils and eosinophil-associated inflammatory mediators (ECP and CysLTs) (1).  In our current studies, we were also struck by [CONTACT_868456], but significantly, increase total IgE in asthmatics, suggestive of a robust Th2 (IL-4/IL-13) response impacting ongoing humoral immune responses.  These results are consistent with published observations regarding increased expression of a type [ADDRESS_1211675] in association with RV infection in asthma (8-10).  Increased reactions to by[CONTACT_868457] (11).  Other ongoing studies by [CONTACT_868458], so this will not be the focus of the current proposal.  However, central to the generation of such a type [ADDRESS_1211676] epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (EC) via their capacity to produce IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP (reviewed in (12)).  These cytokines have important influences in driving Th2 immune deviation. However, more relevant to the innate immune response and the early development of an allergic inflammatory milieu (high in eosinophils, ECP, CysLTs, etc.) is the ability of these cytokines to induce secretion of Th2-associated cytokines from mast cells (IL-33, TSLP) and IL-5 and IL-13 from type 2 innate lymphoid (ILC2) cells (IL-25, IL-33)(13-16).  Our primary aim will explore the capacity of EC from asthmatics to disproportionately produce Th2-promoting cytokines in response to RV infection.  We will then compare levels of these mediators collected in nasal washes and from EC-derived RNA after RV infection of asthmatic subjects and healthy and allergic rhinitis (AR) control individuals.  Our preliminary data support the concept that in cultured nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_868370], IL-25, IL-[ADDRESS_1211677] a defective innate immune response to the virus.  Studies of ex vivo infected bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_868371] 17 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/2021 cells (EC) confirmed decreased type I (IFN-ß) and type III (IFN-l) interferon expression in asthmatics (17-19), as well as deficient IL-15 (20).  IL-15 is a type I IFN-induced cytokine that exerts potent anti-viral effects via activation of NK and CD8+ T cells.  These investigators posit that these deficiencies lead to increased virus load in the lower airway and prolonged symptoms during experimental RV infections.  This is also consistent with the realization that with the evolution of allergic inflammation, asthmatics develop enhanced susceptibility to many viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_868372].  This enhanced susceptibility largely reflects the biological activities of IL-4 and IL-13 in reducing expression of antimicrobial peptides (21-23) along with disruption of epi[INVESTIGATOR_81183] (11, 24).  But also that this increased susceptibility persists even after the disease has been in longstanding remission, demonstrating that these are a combination of genetic (25) and – especially – epi[INVESTIGATOR_868373].  It should be noted that other studies (26-28) failed to confirm more robust RV replication in asthmatics’ lungs following RV infection compared to non-asthmatics.  Likewise, the extent, or indeed whether RV even needs to infect the lower airways to drive an asthma exacerbation remains quite controversial.  While perhaps contributing to the severity of the asthma exacerbation, it is our contention that lower airway infection is not essential for asthma exacerbations to occur.  Analogously, it is understood that upper airway inflammation (e.g., a nasal allergen challenge) exacerbates lower airway inflammation (i.e., asthma) in the absence of direct inoculation of the lower airway (29, 30).  We conceptualize (figure 1) that RV infection in allergic asthmatics exacerbates an allergic inflammatory process with local activation of Th2-like cells, but also numerous innate cells including eosinophil-basophil (Eo/B) progenitors, innate lymphoid type 2 cells (ILC2s), eosinophils and others.  Either hormonally or, more likely, via transit of these cells to the marrow, this drives enhanced hematopoiesis of eosinophils, basophils, mast cell precursors, neutrophils and other cells central to this inflammatory process.  These cells are selectively recruited back into the sinonasal tissue, reflecting local expression by [CONTACT_868459] (e.g., VCAM-1) and numerous relevant chemotaxins (eotaxins, RANTES, CysLTs, etc.).  However, in those individuals with pre-existing asthma – and only those individuals with pre-existing asthma – these same addressins and chemotaxins are expressed in the lower airway and thus a surge in inflammation will concomitantly occur in the lung.  Such a model is consistent with published studies showing a spi[INVESTIGATOR_868374] G-CSF expression, increased neutrophilia, and a later influx of neutrophils into the lung after experimental RV infection, and also with our studies showing similar surges in circulating eosinophilia after RV inoculation (31, 32).  We therefore feel strongly that it is the innate response to RV-infected nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_868375].  It is our contention that AR subjects will behave identically to asthmatics, however, in their case, the absence of relevant addressins and chemotaxins in their lungs (and the functioning immune suppressive tendencies of the healthy lung) precludes development of a lower airway response.  A prediction of this model is that both asthmatic and AR cohorts will display increased circulating mediators of inflammation, but that only in asthmatics will this translate to increased lower airway inflammation.  This model will be validated by [CONTACT_868460], which should develop the systemic (humoral) inflammatory manifestations without any lower airway changes.  But even if lower airway infection is, in fact, what is required to drive asthma

Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211678] (bronchial) EC.  1.2. Rationale for Selection of Investigational Product or Intervention Acute exacerbations are a hallmark of urgent care visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7034], interfere with school and work productivity and as such drive much of the morbidity (and, presumably, all of the mortality) associated with asthma (33).  Equally important, the presence of frequent exacerbations defines an asthma phenotype that is most associated with progressive loss of lung function (34, 35).  Among children and adolescents, 80 to 85% of asthma exacerbations are associated with upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_76133] (36, 37) and of these, RV consistently accounts for ~60-70% of the viruses identified (6, 7, 38-43). For example, in our studies, viral infections were identified in 61% of children aged 3-18 years hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868376] 77% of all positive tests (44).  And even into late adulthood, RV remains responsible for 11% of ED visits for acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_10711] (45).  For these reasons, RV will be the agent investigated in the current studies, to safely and prospectively evaluate the mechanisms that lead to asthma exacerbations, and with the potential for identifying future therapeutic interventions.  It should be noted, however, that RV infections are common and most do not lead to exacerbations ((46) and unpublished data) and, similarly, asthma exacerbations are not a frequent response to experimental RV challenges, including in our published studies (1, 47).  Determining the underlying mechanisms for asthma exacerbations caused by [CONTACT_868461][INVESTIGATOR_868377].  The experimental RV challenge model will be used to test the hypothesis that in asthmatics, nasal RV infection will promote a type 2 inflammatory cytokine milieu.  In addition, we hypothesize that in asthmatics these infections will also prove to be more severe.   The strain of RV that will be used (RV-16) is a pool provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Monica Lawrence’s laboratory at the University of Virginia.  This pool has been extensively safety tested and has been cleared for experimental challenge studies by [CONTACT_1622] (IND# [ZIP_CODE]).  In this investigation, we will use experimental RV challenges to provide a time-sequence analysis of the response to RV following viral inoculation in asthmatic and control subjects.  [CONTACT_447531], is a co-investigator in this study, and has collaborated with [COMPANY_012] Pharmaceutical Research and Development to produce this pool of RV under GMP conditions. This pool has been safety tested and has been approved for experimental challenge studies by [CONTACT_1622].  In addition, this pool of RV has undergone extensive clinical trials using the experimental RV challenge model to evaluate subjects at the University of Virginia.  Using the Jackson criteria for scoring cold symptoms (48, 49), infection rate and total symptom scores are comparable to our previous experience with other rhinovirus challenge pools (both the RV-[ADDRESS_1211679]. Ron Turner) with the gratifying exception of a higher than expected percentage of subjects who developed cold symptoms in the infected volunteers. The severity of cold symptoms, however, were similar to the severity of symptoms recorded by [CONTACT_868462]. Turner and other investigators at UVA using RV [ADDRESS_1211680] be produced under GMP conditions (47, 50, 51). The dose of RV to be used is in this study (approximately 300 TCID50) is similar to that used in our previous challenges (1). This inoculum is likely to be higher than the dose of RV associated with a natural infection, although information regarding how low an RV inoculum is sufficient to produce a cold is not known. Preclinical Experience N/A 1.3. Clinical Studies 
University of Virginia Confidential Page 19 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211681] been detected. The clinical syndrome associated with experimental infection is well-described.  Challenge of volunteers with 100 TCID50 produces infection in 90-95% of susceptible volunteers.  Symptoms first appear within 24 hours after inoculation and peak at 48-72 hours after challenge.  The clinical syndrome is comparable to that reported in natural colds (52, 53) although in one study with identical definitions for duration, the median duration of illness was 3.5 days in volunteers with experimental colds and 5.5 days in volunteers with natural colds (54).  Approximately 1/3rd of RV infections, whether natural or experimental, are asymptomatic.  Virus shedding in infected volunteers follows a pattern similar to that of the symptoms.  Virus concentrations in nasal lavage fluid, based on titers in culture, generally peak 2-3 days after challenge and then rapi[INVESTIGATOR_50948].  Virus can still be recovered by [CONTACT_868463] 20% of subjects on day 18 after challenge, but no virus shedding is detected by [CONTACT_4475] 20 (55).  To the best of our knowledge, human RV-[ADDRESS_1211682] in our studies with RV-16 has developed ANC’s <1000 cells/mm3.   In our previous experimental challenge studies in asthmatics, and those of others, lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_135275] (mild wheeze, cough, dyspnea and/or chest tightness) have been reported in subjects with mild asthma (1, 56).  Our previous studies have also shown that moderate to severe asthma exacerbations caused by [CONTACT_868464], but although less common in asthmatic adults (56), even into late adulthood, RV remains responsible for 11% of ED visits for acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_10711] (45).  As a result, we, as well as other investigators, have done our challenges by [CONTACT_868465] (mostly college students) with mild asthma.  In our studies, we can detect significant differences in lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_135275], methacholine sensitivity, and markers of airway inflammation if we screen our subjects for atopy (total IgE levels ≥125 IU/ml) and do our challenges outside of periods of increased relevant allergen exposure (e.g. in the spring or fall months in Virginia) without risks for causing an asthma exacerbation requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422] (1).  In this regard, one of the important exclusion criteria for participation in our challenges is that we will not enroll subjects who have required treatment in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868378] [ADDRESS_1211683] symptoms (1). Upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868379] (CURTS and CLTRS) over study days 0 to 4 and over study days 0 to 21.  The study showed that in both asthmatic patient groups (i.e., those with high IgE and those with low IgE), the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868380] (P < .001) compared with control patients by [CONTACT_4475] 21 (high IgE = 13.5 [6.2 to 29.3]; low IgE = 8.5 [3.2 to 22.3]; control patients = 0.7 [0.3 to 1.5]). Additionally, by [CONTACT_4475] 4, the CLRTS scores for the asthmatic patients with high IgE were greater (mean [CI]: 4.2 [1.4 to 12.5]) than for the asthmatic patients with low IgE (1.0 [0.4 to 2.5, P = .05) and control patients (0.4 [0.2 to 1.2] P = .0003 (low IgE group versus control patients, P = 0.2).  During the infection, all but [ADDRESS_1211684] symptoms of cough, wheeze, shortness of 
University of Virginia Confidential Page 20 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211685] discomfort and none of the asthmatic patients had symptoms requiring intervention with anti-inflammatory medications (i.e., inhaled or oral steroids).  Also, on the basis of the modified Jackson criteria, the development of peak upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_868381]: for example, 8 of 9 control patients (89%) had peak symptoms during the first 4 days compared with 8 of 16 asthmatic patients (50%, P = .05).  Also, the delayed development of peak symptoms observed for the asthmatic patients was more pronounced in the low IgE group: i.e., 4 of 6 (67%) with high IgE levels had peak symptoms during the first 4 days compared with 4 of 10 (40%) of those with low IgE levels.  During the 21 days of monitoring, asthmatic patients had cumulative symptom scores that were increased and prolonged compared with scores in control patients. The difference between scores for the high IgE group and control patients was significant (P < .02); the difference between scores for the low IgE group and control patients was not significant.   To date, we have inoculated 45 mild asthmatic adults with RV (strains 16 or 39).  Only one of these subjects, who was inoculated with RV-39, experienced audible wheezing and a reduction in FEV1 during peak cold symptoms. Her symptoms responded to a short (5 day) course of oral steroids. She and the other [ADDRESS_1211686] also completed a surveillance study of 16 adults with mild asthma, using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria proposed for this study to monitor the effects of administering omalizumab on natural RV colds. The treatment (i.e. 8 subjects treated with omalizumab and 8 treated with placebo) covered a period of 3 months. No subjects withdrew from this study and there were no adverse events.  Ten of the 16 subjects (62%) had nasal washes, which tested positive for RV by [CONTACT_937]-PCR at least once during clinic visits scheduled every other week. No subject experienced significant chest symptoms or reductions in lung function triggered by [CONTACT_868466].  However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the subjects may have been seropositive to some the strains of RV detected in this surveillance study (57).  For this reason, the experimental challenge study described below is a much better study design, because subjects will either be seronegative, or have low titers (<1:8) of neutralizing antibody to the strain of RV (i.e. RV-16) used for inoculation.     2. Study Hypotheses/Objectives 2.1. Hypotheses We hypothesize that the immune responses generated in the nose of asthmatics underlie subsequent systemic modulation of the immune system, and that – in susceptible individuals (i.e., those with pre-existing asthma) – this modified nasal milieu is responsible for the asthma exacerbation. 2.2. Primary Objective(s) 1. To determine whether RV increases expression of IL-25 transcripts by [CONTACT_868448][INVESTIGATOR_868382] (days 3 and 4). 2. To determine whether RV increases lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868383].  3. To determine whether asthmatics and allergic rhinitics will demonstrate an increased severity of infection in comparison to control subjects. 2.2. Secondary Objective(s) 1. To determine whether asthmatic and AR cohorts demonstrate increased IL-25 transcript expression over the course of RV infection 2. To determine whether asthmatic and AR cohorts demonstrate increased expression of mRNA transcripts of a type 2 cytokine-inducing profile (IL-33 and TSLP).

Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/2021 3. To determine whether increased transcript expression of this type 2 cytokine-inducing profile can be corroborated as increased expression of protein. 4. To determine whether RV infection in the asthma cohort is associated with increases in biomarkers of inflammation. 5. To determine whether increased severity of RV infection in the asthma and AR cohorts will be associated with more symptoms. 6. To determine whether increased severity of RV infection in the asthma and AR cohorts is related to decreased innate immunity. 3. Study Design 3.1. Description of Study Design  A total of 60 subjects will be enrolled in this open label challenge study over a period of 48-54 months (September 2016 – March 2021).

As per UVA requirements for all clinical research, participants will be screened for the presence of fever and symptoms of CoVID-19 at each clinic visit.  These guidelines also require all research subjects to come unaccompanied to all clinic visits and wear masks at all times (except when access to nasal samples is required).  Research personnel are also required to wear masks, gloves, and eye protection.  Additionally, subjects for this study will be required to have a negative CoVID19 test within [ADDRESS_1211689] who develops fever, anosmia, or concerning symptoms of cough or shortness of breath will undergo immediate testing for CoVID-19 and will remain in isolation until the results are available.   For 1 week after inoculation, subjects will be expected to self-quarantine as much as feasible.  Subjects will still be permitted to attend classes, places of employment, dining facilities, and other essential activities during this period.  However, participants should not engage in any non-essential social activities and will be required to wear masks (except while eating) and to socially distance whenever away from their residence.  For volunteers who do not live alone, they will be, as much as possible, to isolate themselves from household contacts for the [ADDRESS_1211690] positive rate at the University of Virginia to be ≤5% in the week prior to any RV challenge.  Additionally, daily cases in Charlottesville/Albemarle County will be <50/100,000 and this incidence will be either decelerating or stable (not increasing).   Primary Outcomes 1. RV-induced expression of IL-25 mRNA transcripts in the asthma and AR cohorts versus healthy controls as determined in nasal scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_868361] 3 and 4 (compared to day 0) as determined by [CONTACT_62865]. 2. RV-induced lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868362] (1) that will include cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and shortness of breath as well as via the asthma control test (ACT).   3. Severity of infection in the asthma and AR cohorts versus healthy controls as quantified by [CONTACT_868449] 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 3.2. Secondary Outcomes 1. IL-25 transcript expression in nasal scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_868361] 1, 2, and 7 (as compared to day 0). 2. Expression by [CONTACT_868448][INVESTIGATOR_868363] a type [ADDRESS_1211691] inflammation will be determined as increases in circulating absolute eosinophil counts, increased FeNO, and as changes in methacholine PD20. 5. Severity of RV infection will be corroborated as increases in upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_868364] (1).  This scoring system includes sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sore throat, headache, malaise, and chills.   6. Severity of RV infection will be correlated with decreased innate immunity as assessed as reduced IFN-a, -ß, -l, and IL-15 measured as qPCR of nasal scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_868365] (EIAs) of nasal secretions (sponge-derived samples). 3.3. Exploratory Outcomes 
University of Virginia Confidential Page 23 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211692] been problematic and, additionally, IL-33 needs to be activated and, therefore, measuring full length IL-33 (or IL-33 transcripts) will not necessarily reflect biological activity.  We therefore propose to complement these assays with functional studies demonstrating the ability of nasal secretions to support Th2 immune deviation in an ongoing immune response. For these studies we will investigate a non-specific pan-activating T cell signal (aCD3/ aCD28 beads) and a universal antigen (tetanus) that consistently expand both Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes.  These studies will demonstrate a Th2 immune deviating “milieu” but cannot address the specific cytokine responsible.  However, these approaches permit the use of individual or combinations of neutralizing antibodies (and/or in the case of IL-33, blocking anti-ST2 antibody) that will allow us to identify the specific cytokine (or combinations) driving Th2 immune deviation. 2. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_868384]-25, IL-33, and TSLP genes will be assessed on nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_868385] (day -28) using bisulphite modification/methylation-specific PCR and changes in histone acetylation patterns.   3. Nasal biopsies will be performed at day [ADDRESS_1211693] (>90%) virions remain intracellular and, as such, nasal secretions do not accurately reflect the extent of viral infection.  More importantly, nasal washes do not accurately sample the primary site of infection (the adenoids).  Nor do washes give information regarding the diffuseness or associated cytopathological response of the infection, specifically whether cell death is apoptotic (and, as such, anti-inflammatory with IL-10, TGF-ß, and PgE2 release) or necrotic (and, as such, pro-inflammatory with IL33 release).  For these reasons, a key component of the current studies will be to assess these parameters via nasal biopsies.  These studies will be used to explore:  1. the extent of viral infection – i.e. whether this occurs diffusely throughout the nares or remains focally within the adenoids; 2. the comprehensiveness of epi[INVESTIGATOR_868386] 3. the presence and extent of infection-associated cell death and 4. whether this represents cytopathic (necrotic) or apoptotic cell death.  4. We will also determine whether RV infection in the asthma cohort is associated with increased use of rescue inhaler and decreased lung function.  Use of albuterol metered dose inhaler will be assessed by [CONTACT_868467]1 monitored by a Microlife hand held monitor 3.4. Stratification, Randomization, and Blinding/Masking N/A.  This is an open label study of a single RV inoculation.  Data will be compared between healthy controls, allergic rhinitic controls, and asthmatic subjects.  3.4.1. Procedure for Unblinding/Unmasking N/A.  Study is not blinded. 4. Selection of Participants and Clinical Sites/Laboratories 4.1. Rationale for Study Population Asthmatics will be studied as the relevant target for RV-induced asthma exacerbations and compared to control and AR subjects to identify the basis for their unique sensitivity. We will study mild asthmatics who are well-controlled with or without long-term controllers and low risk insofar as they have no recent (3-year) history of exacerbations to mitigate the risk of a severe asthma exacerbation during the study.  It is our contention that it is the innate response to RV-infected nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_868387], as such, that AR subjects will behave identically to asthmatics, however, in their case, the absence of relevant addressins and chemotaxins in their lungs precludes development of a lower airway response.  We will therefore also enroll AR subjects to validate this concept that both asthmatic and AR cohorts will display increased circulating mediators of inflammation, but that only in asthmatics will

The clinical syndrome associated with experimental infection is well described.  Challenge of volunteers with approximately 300 TCID50 of RV produces infection in 90 to 95% of susceptible volunteers.  Symptoms first appear within 24 hours after inoculation and peak at 48-72 hours after challenge.  The clinical syndrome is comparable to that reported in natural colds (52, 53).  Approximately one-third of RV infections, whether natural or experimental, are asymptomatic.  Virus shedding in infected volunteers follows a pattern similar to that of the symptoms.  Virus concentrations in nasal lavage fluid, based on titers in culture, generally peak 2-3 days after challenge and then rapi[INVESTIGATOR_50948].  Virus can be recovered by [CONTACT_868463] 20% of subjects on day 18 after challenge, but no virus shedding is detected by [CONTACT_4475] 20 (55).

Should any subject develop an ANC or ALC below 500/µL on Day 4, a repeat CBC will be done on Day [ADDRESS_1211707] also been performed on mild/moderate persistent asthmatics who are very well controlled on long-term controllers (inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting ß-agonists) without untoward reactions.(58)  In our first study of asthmatics enrolled in challenge studies at the University of Virginia using RV-39, one of 19 subjects needed intervention with inhaled steroids during peak cold symptoms (47). One college student enrolled in our studies needed a short course of oral steroids when challenged with RV-[ADDRESS_1211708] discomfort during the infection, but none required intervention with anti-inflammatory medications such as inhaled or oral corticosteroids (1). We are interested to use this new pool because the majority of published data from experimental challenges with RV have been done using RV-16, which is helpful in comparing our results (e.g., (8, 31)). All subjects in the proposed study will be inoculated with RV-16 and monitored daily for 4 days following inoculation in the clinical research center at UVA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_868389] 7 dpi. Daily monitoring will include upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868390], and FEV1 measurements (using a hand held FEV1 monitor given to each subject), which will be recorded twice daily (morning and evening) on diary cards. Subjects will also be recording the number of puffs of albuterol used daily from metered dose inhalers.  In addition, monitoring each morning will include a physical examination focused on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], along with spi[INVESTIGATOR_868391] (FeNO).  This monitoring will be done to enhance our ability to detect changes during the acute infection and to ensure safety. The research team member will be a licensed physician or nurse and will be readily available should any problems occur. Thus far, no significant problems or serious adverse events have occurred for any of the asthmatics inoculated with either RV-16 or RV-39.  The inclusion of mild-/moderate-persistent asthmatics who are very well controlled on inhaled CCS could lead to more severe exacerbations.  However, this has not been the experience of other research groups enrolling this population (58).  Furthermore, as noted, the average American has 4 respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]/yr and we would argue that as none of these subjects will have had even a modest asthma exacerbation in the previous 3 years (over which time they will on average have had 12 RV infections) we do not feel this modification adds an untoward risk to the study.  And that the current safety monitoring criteria will continue to suffice.   As for any adverse long-term safety effects of an experimental RV-[ADDRESS_1211709] been generally similar to, but a bit shorter in duration than a natural RV infection (see above).

Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211710] or Intervention cited in Medical Literature Recently, in European studies, challenges with RV-16 were well-tolerated by [CONTACT_868468] (9, 59) .  However, asthmatic subjects in those studies were using inhaled steroids at the time of inoculation, which would interfere with our goals of judging the effects of RV infection on lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868392]-markers of inflammation.   5.3. Risks of Other Protocol Specified Medications Albuterol:  Risks of albuterol used to treat RV-induced symptoms or to reverse symptoms induced by [CONTACT_868469][INVESTIGATOR_038]/FeNO include palpi[INVESTIGATOR_729838].   Oral corticosteroids: Short courses of oral CCS (3-5 days) may be indicated to treat more serious asthma exacerbations.  Short-term administration of prednisone is associated with appetite stimulation, weight gain, hyperglycemia, transient increases in blood pressure, fluid retention, stomach upset, and agitation/insomnia.   Nasal decongestant/nasal analgesic.  Subjects will have a nasal decongestant (oxymetazoline) and analgesic (lidocaine 4%) sprayed into their nose prior to the nasal biopsy. Oxymetazoline will also be given to subjects with directions for use if needed following the procedure to treat mild delayed bleeding. In addition, biopsy sites may be injected with additional lidocaine (1%) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:100,000).  There are no side effects to topi[INVESTIGATOR_868393].  Lidocaine at very high doses can produce cardiac arrhythmias, however, there is no risk for this occurring at the doses that will be used for this study.   5.4. Risks of Study Procedures  Nasal lavage: may be associated with some discomfort due to <10 second breath hold and the feeling of fluid in the nares.  A potential complication is acute bacterial sinusitis (sinus infection) although this has never occurred in thousands of procedures done by [CONTACT_3019].   Light nasal scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  An additional nasal specimen will be obtained by [CONTACT_868470]-Pro® nasal mucosal curette plastic device to do a light scrappi[INVESTIGATOR_868394]. The nasal scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_868395].  It is possible that nasal scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_868396], which would be treated with local pressure for several minutes. Nasal lining fluid:  An additional nasal specimen will be obtained by [CONTACT_2931] a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] (1 X 1 cm) of sterile gauze to inferior turbinate for [ADDRESS_1211711] a sample of epi[INVESTIGATOR_868397] (about 0.2 ml).  Other than local discomfort no complications are known to occur with this procedure.   Blood draw:  Drawing blood causes transient discomfort and may cause fainting.  Ecchymosis (bruising) at the blood draw site may occur but can be prevented or lessened by [CONTACT_452387].  The use of sterile technique will make infection extremely unlikely. Lung function tests, exhaled nitric oxide testing, and methacholine challenge: The risk of lung function tests and eNO testing is the discomfort of exhaling forcefully.  This may be associated with mild shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness, wheezing, or chest soreness.  Most patients do not have any symptoms. Symptoms (if they occur) are mild, last only a few minutes, and disappear following the inhalation of a bronchodilator medication, which will be

Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211712] visualization hemostasis can be readily achieved with application of pressure, topi[INVESTIGATOR_868398].  Vasovagal events are expected in a small number of subjects; therefore, subjects will be closely monitored for such symptoms during the biopsy procedure.  If signs of a vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_868399], the chair will put in a reclining position until the subject no longer reports symptoms or demonstrates signs consistent with low blood pressure.  There is a theoretical risk of infection although in our experience this has never occurred.  To assess the degree of post-procedure signs and symptoms the first 5 number subjects will not undergo the biopsy until the completion of the nasal biopsy in the prior participant.  Silver Nitrate Cautery: Lidocaine will have been applied prior to the cauterization; however, once the anesthetic wears off, subjects may experience tenderness and discomfort for a few days as well as a runny nose for up to a week after the treatment.  Silver nitrate cautery also carries a rare risk of infection.      5.5.  Potential Benefits Each subject enrolled will be aware that the results are likely to provide new insights into the mechanism and eventually treatment and ongoing management of asthma triggered by [CONTACT_290730]. The benefits of participating in these studies are likely to outweigh any risk from the experimental RV challenges, which have been performed safely at our institution for over [ADDRESS_1211713] events.  6.

Lawrence’s laboratory will prepare in a laminar flow hood a single-use vial containing approximately 300 TCID50 in 1 mL of Lactated Ringer’s solution for human use, using aseptic techniques as per the lab’s SOP.  The actual challenge dose of the virus will be determined by [CONTACT_868471].  The label for the pre-titered vial dispensed for this study label will include at least the following information: • RV-16 challenge inoculum dose • Protocol number • Investigational use statement • Date and time prepared  Designated study staff will receive the challenge virus dose which will be transported to the Allergy Research Lab on wet ice using an insulated, closed container with a biohazard label.  The vial of inoculum is transferred to a -80° freezer and stored until the day of inoculation.  It is then thawed as per the SOP. Once thawed the inoculum must be used promptly (within 4 hours) to insure proper dosage potency, although there is evidence that the virus remains viable, and TCID50 stable, for extended periods when stored at 4oC.    [IP_ADDRESS] Dosage, Preparation, and Administration For virus inoculation, each patient will be inoculated with approximately 300 TCID50 after obtaining the pre-virus inoculation nasal wash.  Dose selection is described in Section 1.2 (Rationale for Selection of Investigational Product or Intervention) Approximately 75 TCID50/0.25 ml will be instilled into each nostril during the initial inoculation. Five to 10 minutes after the initial inoculation, another inoculum (using the same amount of RV) will be administered for a total of 1 ml.  6.2. Drug Accountability Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) the investigator will maintain adequate records of the disposition of the investigational agent, including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispensed (participant-by-participant accounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed. Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by [CONTACT_3452].  A drug-dispensing log will be kept current for each participant.  This log will contain the identification of each participant and the date and quantity of drug dispensed. All records regarding the disposition of the investigational product will be available for inspection. 6.3.

Will be evaluated for gene expression by [CONTACT_4503]-PCR for epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]-associated genes associated with induction of Th2 profile (IL-25, IL-33, TSLP, and chemokines) and genes involved in anti-viral immunity (IFN-a, IFN-ß, IFN-l, and IL-15).   2. Nasal Secretions (and Sponge): Will be evaluated for viral load by [CONTACT_868477].  In addition, this material will be used to evaluate its Th2 immune deviating propensity.   3. Blood samples: Will be obtained for absolute eosinophil count.  PBMCs (50-ml) obtained on day -7 will be enriched from the blood sample and used to address presence of immune-deviating propensity of the nasal sponge-derived milieu.  Briefly, CD14+ monocytes will be obtained at visit 1 and differentiated into mDC in the presence of GMCSF and IL-4.  After 4 days mDC will be pulsed with tetanus and other relevant antigens for 2 additional days.  A blood sample (50-ml) will also be obtained on day 4 and enriched for CD3+ T lymphocytes.  At

Parallel samples of CD3+ T cells will be directly stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads and co-cultured with or without nasal secretion samples.   After 5 days intracellular cytokine staining will be performed and % of Th1 (IFN-g) and Th2 (IL-4) positive T cells determined amongst the CFSElow T cells.  4. Nasal biopsies: Up to three biopsies will be obtained at day 4 dpi.  These specimens will be evaluated via immunohistochemistry to determine % of cell infected with RV.  In parallel samples, epi[INVESTIGATOR_868405]-conjugated EpCAM and cell death/apoptosis quantified amongst the EpCAM positive population via staining with Annexin V/PI.    10. Biospecimen Storage No long-term storage of biospecimens is anticipated.  Blood samples obtained at screening/baseline visit (for later assessment of Th2 immune deviation) will be stored in liquid N2 in the PIs laboratory.  Similarly, nasal secretion/nasal sponge samples will be stored in a -20oC freezer in the PIs laboratory.  The laboratory is always locked and is within a secured building (MR4 Bldg).   11. Criteria for Participant and Study Completion and Premature Study Termination 11.1. Participant Completion Individuals will have completed their participation when they have completed all of their scheduled study visits.   11.2. Participant Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_692430]: 1. The participant elects to withdraw consent from all future study activities, including follow-up. 2. The participant is “lost to follow-up” (i.e., no further follow-up is possible because attempts to reestablish contact [CONTACT_73880]). 3. The participant dies.  4. The Investigator no longer believes participation is in the best interest of the participant. 5. Individual safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]: a. The participant develops a medical condition or is started on new medication(s) that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant’s ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality of the data obtained from the study. b. A severe asthma exacerbation that requires treatment in the emergency room, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the use of systemic steroids, at any time during the study. c. Use of a required but excluded medication such as inhaled corticosteroids or leukotriene modifiers. d. Non-adherence to study procedures.  Patients who miss visit [ADDRESS_1211723]

Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/2021 Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational drug [or investigational study therapy regimen] caused the adverse event. For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)). 12.2.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not consistent with the risk information described in the Investigational Brochure.

Death. 2. A life-threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or DAIT/NIAID, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. 5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_453541]. 12.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events 12.3.1 Grading Criteria The study site will grade the severity of adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_692495]’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) [version 5.0].  This document (referred to herein as the NCI-CTCAE manual) provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse 
University of Virginia Confidential Page 40 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211727] population to be studied in this protocol.  Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the NCI-CTCAE manual: Grade 1 = mild adverse event. Grade 2 = moderate adverse event. Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event. Grade 4 = life-threatening or disabling adverse event. Grade 5 = death. Events grade 2 or higher will be recorded on the appropriate AE case report form [paper CRF] for this study. For grading an abnormal value or result of a clinical or laboratory evaluation (including, but not limited to, a radiograph, an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram etc.), a treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as an increase in grade from baseline or from the last post-baseline value that doesn’t meet grading criteria. Changes in grade from screening to baseline will also be recorded as adverse events, but are not treatment-emergent. If a specific event or result from a given clinical or laboratory evaluation is not noted above in section 12.2.1 and is also not included in the NCI-CTCAE manual , then an abnormal result would be considered an adverse event if changes in therapy or monitoring are implemented as a result of the event/result. 12.3.2 Attribution Definitions The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study therapy regimen or study procedure(s) will initially be determined by [CONTACT_623002] [paper case report form (AE/SAE paper CRF)].  Final determination of attribution for safety reporting will be determined by [CONTACT_73884]/NIAID.  The relationship of an adverse event to study therapy regimen or procedures will be determined using the descriptors and definitions provided in Table 12.3.2.  For additional information and a printable version of the NCI-CTCAE manual, consult the NCI-CTCAE web site: https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_50          Table 12.3.2 Attribution of Adverse Events Code Descriptor Relationship (to primary investigational product and/or other concurrent mandated study therapy or study procedure) UNRELATED CATEGORY 1 Unrelated The adverse event is clearly not related:  there is insufficient evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  RELATED CATEGORIES 2 Possible The adverse event has a reasonable possibility to be related; there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship. 3 Definite The adverse event is clearly related.

Note that all adverse events (not just those requiring 24-hour reporting) will be reported in the Annual IND Report. [IP_ADDRESS] Expedited Safety Reporting  This option, with 2 possible categories, applies if the adverse event is classified as one of the following: Category 1:  Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction [S[LOCATION_003]R] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS], Suspected Adverse Reaction and Section 12.2, Unexpected Adverse Event and 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)i).  The IND sponsor shall report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  The IND sponsor must report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event, such as: 1. A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); 2. One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture); 3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  Category 2: Any findings from studies that suggests a significant human risk   The sponsor shall report any findings from other epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], analyses of adverse events within the current study or pooled analysis across clinical studies or animal or in vitro testing (e.g. mutagenicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity) that suggest a significant risk in

Additionally, the Independent Medical Monitor who is a physician who is independent from the study team and will, at minimum, review all SAEs to assess for possible changes to the overall risk of the study. This person will be expected to communicate with the Protocol Chair/Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_868409]. 12.8.2 DSMB Review  [IP_ADDRESS] Planned DSMB Reviews  The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) shall review safety data at least yearly during planned DSMB Data Review Meetings. Data for the planned safety reviews will include, at a minimum, a listing of all reported AEs and SAEs.   The DSMB will be informed of an Expedited Safety Report in a timely manner.   [IP_ADDRESS] Ad hoc DSMB Reviews  In addition to the pre-scheduled data reviews and planned safety monitoring, the DSMB may be called upon for ad hoc reviews. The DSMB will  review any event that potentially impacts safety at the request of the protocol chair or DAIT/NIAID. In addition, any study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_868410]:  After review of the data, the DSMB will make recommendations regarding study conduct and/or continuation. [IP_ADDRESS].1 Temporary Suspension of enrollment for ad hoc DSMB Safety Review  § Any participant develops a severe asthma exacerbation that requires treatment in the emergency room, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the use of systemic steroids, at any time during the study. A temporary halt in enrollment will be implemented if an ad hoc DSMB safety review is required.   13. Statistical Considerations and Analytical Plan 13.1 Overview  Objectives: Our primary objective will be to address the hypothesis that epi[INVESTIGATOR_868411] (EC) during the evolution of allergic airway disease as a result of which nasal EC are programmed to produce cytokines central to orchestrating an allergic inflammatory immune response in the upper – and lower – airways.  We will determine whether nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_868412], is programmed to secrete cytokines that promote a Th2 cytokine “signature” (IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP) as well as mediators directly driving engagement of an allergic inflammatory process (including CCL5, CCL11, CXCL1, and GMCSF).  A total of 60 subjects will be enrolled including 20 each that are normal controls, allergic rhinitis controls, and asthmatics.  Cytokine/chemokine will be collected at day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and [ADDRESS_1211736]-infection and evaluated by [CONTACT_868479].   
University of Virginia Confidential Page 45 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211737] that in asthma and AR systemic increases in eosinophilia will be observed, but that only in asthmatics will increased asthma symptoms, bronchial hyperreactivity, and eNO be observed.   Analytical approach:  The RV challenge model is an example of a serial study design, in which subjects will receive a nasal presentation of RV-16 on challenge day 0 and then they will be serially monitored in the CRU for 7 days.  Analytical method selection:  Due to the fact that most of our data collection will be serial in nature, i.e. data will be collected on challenge days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7, the analytical methods that we select to use to analyze our primary and secondary outcome data will take into account the repeated measure aspect of the RV challenge model.  Missing data:  We will make a concretive effort to limit the occurrence of missing data, and if deemed necessary, multiple-imputation methods will be utilized to control biases associated with incomplete data.  Levels of detection:  If specimen levels are below the level of assay detection, we will use the mid-point between 0 and the minimum detection level of the assay as the unit of analysis.              13.2 Outcomes  • IL-25, IL-33, TSLP qPCR in nasal scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-derived specimens (days 1-7) • IL-25, IL-33, TSLP protein in nasal sponge-derived specimens (days 1-7) • Th2 immune deviating activity in nasal sponge-derived specimens (days 1-7) • Upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868413] (days 1-7) • FEV1 (days 1-7) • FeNO (days 1-7) • Circulating AEC (day 4) • Bronchial hyperreactivity (methacholine PD20) (day 4) • RV load in nasal secretions (qPCR) (days 1-7) • IFN-a, ß-, l and IL-15 by [CONTACT_62865] (days 1-7) • Nasal biopsy samples (day 4) will be evaluate for % of infected cells and amongst the cells whether they display evidence of apoptosis (annexin V positive) or necrosis (PI [CONTACT_95570]).   13.3 Measures to Minimize Bias  N/A Analysis Plan 13.4.1 Analysis Populations. Normal control subjects, allergic rhinitis controls, and asthmatics 13.4.2 Primary Analysis of Primary Endpoint(s)/Outcome(s)   Analysis of RV-induced IL-25 expression:  The endpoint data will be the challenge study day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 nasal scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_868414]-25 qPCR expression.   Endpoint transformations: Since we expect that the IL-25 expression measurements on any particular challenge study day (i.e. day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7) will be distributed approximately Log-Normal (positive skewed distribution), we will transform the IL-25 expression data to the natural logarithmic scale.   
University of Virginia Confidential Page 46 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/2021 Units of analysis:  The day 0 loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) measurements will subtracted from the post-challenge day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) measurements and these subject-specific pre- versus post-challenge changes in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) will be the units of analysis.  Analytical approach:  The changes in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) on post-challenge days 1, 2, 3, 4, and [ADDRESS_1211738] of a linear mixed model (LMM).  LMM fixed effects:  Two sources of variability in the pre- versus post-challenge changes in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) will be of primary interest.  One source of variability will be the study-group to study-group variability (i.e. asthmatics, allergic rhinitis controls, and healthy-controls) in the changes in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression), while the other source of variability will be the post-challenge day to day variability in the changes in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression).  Concomitant variable variability: Variability in the loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) changes due to inherent differences in day 0 loge(IL-25 qPCR  expression) will be extracted from the residual error to increase statistical power.  Random effects:  Subject-specific and time-specific random effects will be incorporated into the LMM to allow intra-subject measurement correlation to be accounted for in variance estimation and hypothesis testing.  Hypothesis testing:  Between-study-group comparisons: With regard to hypothesis testing, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_868415]-group comparisons of the mean changes in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) on post-challenge study days 3 and 4 when cold symptoms are expected to peak.  More specifically, we will compare if the study-day 3 and study-day 4 mean changes in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) differ between the 3 different underlying study-populations after taking into account the inherent variability in challenge study-day 0 loge(IL-25 qPCR expression).  These comparisons will require conducting a total of 6 hypothesis tests (i.e. 3 per study day), and in order to maintain an intraday experimental-type I error rate of 0.05, the null hypothesis rejection rule for the “intraday” between-group comparisons will be based on a Bonferroni corrected two-sided p≤0.0167 (i.e. 0.05/3) rejection rule.  Within-study-group comparisons:   On a per study-group basis, we will conduct statistical tests to determine if the means of the loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) distributions on post-challenge days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7, differ from the mean of the loge(cytokine expression) distribution on challenge  study day 0.  The within-study-group comparisons will be considered secondary in nature, and this set of comparisons will be primarily focused on the challenge study-day 3 and challenge study-day 4 changes in mean loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) when symptoms are expected to peak.  More specifically, we will test if the mean of the loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) distribution is the same on challenge study-day 0 and challenge study-day 3 and if the mean of the loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) distribution is the same on challenge study-day 0 and challenge study-day 4.  A Bonferroni corrected two-sided p≤0.025 (i.e. 0.05/2) decision rule will be utilized as the null hypothesis rejection criterion for this set of tests.  Confidence intervals: To aid in data interpretation, a 95% confidence interval will be constructed for each between-group comparison and for each within-group comparison.  Scale of interpretation: The point-estimate and the lower and the upper 95% confidence interval limits will be anti-log transformed so that point-estimate and the lower and the upper limits of the 95% confidence interval represent ratios of geometric mean cytokine expression.   Alternative analytical approach:  If the linear mixed model assumptions are deemed to be violated for this endpoint, we will use a linear mixed model based permutation test strategy to derive empi[INVESTIGATOR_868416]-group and within-group hypotheses.      Analysis of RV-induced lower-respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]:  The lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868417]-days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7, will be analyzed in two different ways.  In the first approach; due to the expect infrequency of lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868418], cumulative lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868419] (CLRTS) will be computed for challenge period; day 0 to day 4, and for challenge period; day 0 to day 7.  In the second approach the daily total lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868420].     
University of Virginia Confidential Page 47 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/2021  Analytical approach #1:  We will use the total lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868421] 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to compute to a cumulative lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_617356] (CLRTS) for challenge period day 0 to day 4, and we will use the total lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868421] 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 to compute a CLRTS for challenge period day 0 to day 7.  Analytical approach: The CLRTS will be analyzed as integer scaled random variables by [CONTACT_34058] a Negative Binomial (NB) generalized estimating equation (GEE) model.   GEE model specification: The GEE model specification for the CLRTS analysis will include two predictor variables. One predictor variable will identify the study-group (i.e. asthmatics, allergic rhinitis controls, and healthy-controls) while the other predictor variable will identify the challenge period (i.e. day 0 to day 4, or day 0 to day 7).  Variance estimation: An “unstructured” variance-covariance matrix form will be utilized to account for the inherent correlation between the first set of CLRTS scores (challenge day 0 to challenge day 4) and the second set of CLRTS scores (challenge day 0 to challenge day 7).  Hypothesis testing:  Wald tests will be conducted to determine if the means of CLRTS distributions for each challenge period differ from study-population to study populations.  A Bonferroni two-sided p≤0.0167 (0.05/3) criterion will be utilized as the null hypothesis rejection rule for the intra-challenge-period, between-group comparisons.       Analytical approach # 2: We will analyze the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868422] 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 as repeated measures in this approach.  Analytical approach:  The lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868423] a negative-binomial generalized estimating equation (GEE) model.  Model specification: The GEE model specification will include two predictor variables.  One predictor variable will identify the study-group (i.e. asthmatics, allergic rhinitis controls, and healthy-controls), while the other predictor variable will identify the challenge study-day (i.e. day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7).  Variance estimation:  A “working independence” variance covariance matrix form will be utilized to account for the inherent intra-subject measurement correlation induced by [CONTACT_868480].  Hypothesis testing:  Wald chi-square tests will be utilized to test if the means of total lower symptom score distributions on a particular challenge day differed between the 3 different study-groups.  The primary focus will be to determine if the means of total lower symptom score distributions differed between the 3 different study-groups on study-days 3 and 4, when symptoms are expected to peak.                 Analysis of the severity of RV-induced infection: The post-challenge (i.e. challenge days 1 to 7) RV loads in the nasal secretions of challenged subjects will be derived via qPCR. Quantification is based upon serial dilutions of a standardized pool of the virus with a known TCID50/ml.  Data transformation:   Since the RV load data will be quantified in terms of “virion frequency per unit volume of nasal section”, it is expected that based on previous RV challenge studies that the RV load data will have to be analyzed on the log10 scale.  Analytical approach:  The nasal secretion RV load data will be analyzed via a LMM.  Model specification: Two sources of nasal secretion RV load variability will be examined.  One source of variability will be the study-group to study group variability (i.e. asthmatics, allergic rhinitis controls, healthy-controls) and the other source of variability will be the post-challenge day to day variability (i.e. challenge day 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7).  Hypothesis testing:  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_868424]-group comparisons will be focused on the post-challenge day [ADDRESS_1211739]-challenge day 3 and day 4 mean log10(nasal secretion RV load) will be compared in a pairwise manner between the 3 different study-populations.  In order to maintain an intraday experimental type I error rate 0.05, a Bonferroni corrected two-sided p≤0.05/3 decision rule will be utilized as the null hypothesis rejection rule.

Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211740]-challenge day 1, 2, and 7 between-group comparisons of mean log10(nasal secretion RV load) will be consider as secondary comparisons and the same hypothesis testing procedures will be employed to conduct these between-group comparisons.   Within-group related hypotheses will also be considered as secondary hypotheses.  Scale of interpretation:  The point estimates and 95% confidence interval limits for the between-group and the within-group comparisons of mean log10(RV load) will be anti-log transformed so that the between-group comparisons and the within-group comparisons of nasal secretion RV load can be interpreted as ratios of “nasal secretion RV load” geometric means.    13.4.3 Supportive Analyses of the Primary Outcome(s)  Supportive analyses for the primary outcomes: As supportive analyses we will examine the IL-[ADDRESS_1211741] as the nasal scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_868425]-25 expression data (see above).   13.4.4 Analyses of Secondary and Other Outcome(s) As indicated in section 3.1 and 13.2 there will be several secondary outcome variables and the analytical plans related to these outcome variables will be briefly described in this subsection.  Analysis of expression of nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_868363] a type 2 cytokine-inducting profile:  We will evaluate the time course of IL-33 and TSLP transcription expression by [CONTACT_868481] 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.   Endpoint transformations: Since we expect that the IL-33 and TSLP expression measurements on any particular challenge day (i.e. day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7) will be distributed approximately Log-Normal (positive skewed distribution), we will transform the IL-33 and TSLP expression data to the natural logarithmic scale.  Units of analysis:  The day 0 loge(cytokine qPCR expression) measurements will subtracted from the post-challenge day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 loge(cytokine qPCR expression ) measurements and these subject-specific pre- versus post-challenge changes in loge(cytokine qPCR expression) will be the units of analysis.  Analytical approach:  The changes in loge(IL-33 qPCR expression) on post-challenge days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7, and the changes in loge(TSLP qPCR expression) on post-challenge days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7,  will be analyzed as repeated measures by [CONTACT_868482] (LMM).  Model specification:  Per outcome variable, the LMM specification will the same as the LMM specification for the analysis of the post-challenge days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 changes in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) (see section 13.4.2 above).   Hypothesis testing:  The between-group hypothesis, and the within-group hypotheses, will be identical to those described in “Hypothesis testing” section of the IL-25 qPCR analytical approach (see section 13.4.2 above).    Analysis of IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP protein expression by [CONTACT_191117].  We will evaluate the time course of IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP protein expression by [CONTACT_868483] 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.

Analysis of albuterol metered dose inhaler utilization:  Albuterol metered dose inhaler utilization will be evaluated on challenge days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 within the asthma cohort to determine if the frequency of albuterol inhaler utilization is related to severity of symptoms.

Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/2021 Analytical approach: Based on diary records, the total number of times that the subjects used their albuterol metered dose inhaler will be determined for study days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7, and these frequencies will be analyzed via a Negative Binomial generalized estimating equation (GEE) model.   Hypothesis testing:  Our primary interest, will be to compare albuterol metered dose inhaler utilization on post-challenge days [ADDRESS_1211743] will be the pi[INVESTIGATOR_868426]-day comparisons and the multiple comparison experimental type 1 error rate for the inter-day comparisons will  0.05.      Secondary analyses: As secondary analyses, Negative Binomial GEE regression models will be utilized to determine if RV loads and total upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868427] 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and [ADDRESS_1211744] albuterol metered dose inhaler utilization on challenge days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.     Analysis of FEV1:  Measurements of FEV1 will be acquired on challenge study days: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. Data transformation: If the FEV1 measurement distributions for challenge study days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 are positively skewed, the FEV1 will be transformed to the natural logarithmic scale, otherwise the FEV1 data will be analyzed on the mL scale.    Units of analysis:  The challenge study day [ADDRESS_1211745]-challenge changes in FEV1 will be the units of analysis.  Analytical approach: The post-challenge changes in FEV1 will be analyzed via a LMM.  LMM specification:  Two source of variability in the post-challenge changes in the FEV1 measurements will be examined.  One source of variability will be the study-group to study group variability (i.e. asthmatics, allergic rhinitis controls, and healthy-controls), while the other source of variation will be the post-challenge day to day variability (i.e. challenge study day 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7).   Variability in the FEV1 changes due to inherent differences in the challenge study day 0 Fev1 (baseline) will be extracted from the residual error to increase statistical power. Random effects:  Subject-specific and time-specific random effects will be incorporated into the LMM to allow intra-subject measurement correlation to be accounted for in variance estimation and hypothesis testing.  Hypothesis testing:  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_868424]-group comparisons will be focused on the post-challenge day [ADDRESS_1211746]-challenge day 3 and day 4 mean changes in FEV1 will be compared in a pairwise manner between the 3 different study populations.  In order to maintain an intraday specific experimental type I error rate 0.05, a Bonferroni corrected two-sided p≤0.05/[ADDRESS_1211747] these between-group comparisons.   Within-group related hypotheses will also be considered as secondary hypotheses.     Analysis of FeNO: FeNO will be derived from lung-function tests that will be conducted on challenge study days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. Data transformation: If the FeNO measurement distributions for challenge study days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 are positively skewed, the FeNO data will be transformed to the natural logarithmic scale, otherwise the FeNO data will be analyzed on the ppb scale.    Analytical approach: The FeNO data will be analyzed via a LMM.  LMM specification: The LMM specification will an exactly the same as the LMM model specification for the FEV1 analysis (see above).  Hypothesis testing: The pi[INVESTIGATOR_868424]-group comparisons will be focused on the post-challenge day [ADDRESS_1211748]-challenge day 3 and day 4 mean changes in FeNO will be compared in a pairwise manner between the 3 different study-populations.

Within-group related hypotheses will also be considered as secondary hypotheses.     Analysis of bronchial hyperreactivity (methacholine PD20):  The changes in bronchial hyperactivity from before challenge to after challenge will be quantified in terms of the changes in methacholine challenge PD20 from pre-challenge day -[ADDRESS_1211750] challenge day 4 (D PD20).   Analytical approach: The D PD20 data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_868484] (ANOVA).  Model specification: The primary source of D PD20 variation that will be examined will be the variation due to study-group to study-group variation.  Hypothesis testing: We will test if the 3 underlying study-population D PD20 distributions share the same mean.   If rejected a Bonferroni corrected two-sided p≤0.05/3 decision rule will be utilized as the null hypothesis rejection rule for between-group comparisons.  Alternative analytical approach: If the ANOVA model assumptions are violated, the D PD20 data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_143116]-free permutation methods.    Analysis of circulating eosinophil count: Changes in the absolute eosinophil count (AEC) from day -[ADDRESS_1211751]-challenge day 4 will be compared between the 3 different groups via ANOVA.   Model specification: The primary source of D AEC variation that will be examined will be the variation due to study-group to study-group variation.  Hypothesis testing: We will test if the 3 underlying study-population D AEC distributions share the same mean.   A p≤0.[ADDRESS_1211752].  If rejected a Bonferroni corrected two-sided p≤0.05/3 decision rule will be utilized as the null hypothesis rejection rule for between-group comparisons.  Alternative analytical approach: If the ANOVA model assumptions are violated, the D %EC data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_143116]-free permutation methods.    Analysis of eosinophil percent of total cells: Changes in the eosinophil percent of total cells (D %EC) from day -[ADDRESS_1211753]-challenge day 4 will be compared between the 3 different groups via ANOVA.   Model specification: The primary source of  D %EC variation that will be examined will be the variation due to study-group to study-group variation.  Hypothesis testing: We will test if the 3 underlying study-population D %EC distributions share the same mean.   A p≤0.[ADDRESS_1211754].  If rejected a Bonferroni corrected two-sided p≤0.05/3 decision rule will be utilized as the null hypothesis rejection rule for between-group comparisons. .  Alternative analytical approach: If the ANOVA model assumptions are violated, the D %EC data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_143116]-free permutation methods.    Analysis of upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_868428]:  The upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_868429] [ADDRESS_1211755] approach, cumulative upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_868419] (CURTS) will be computed for challenge days 0 to 4, and for challenge days 0 to 7.  In the second approach the daily total upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_868420].   Please see the analytical plan for the analysis lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_868430] (section 13.4.2).        Analysis of innate immune deviating activity:  IFN-a, ß-, l and IL-15 data will be derived via qPCR from the RV challenge study day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 nasal secretion samples.  Data transformation:  We expect that anti-viral 
University of Virginia Confidential Page 51 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211756] to be analyzed on the logarithmic scale. Units of analysis:  Per endpoint (e.g. IFN-a), the  challenge study day 0 loge(expression) levels of the endpoint will subtracted from the day 1, 2, 3, 4, and [ADDRESS_1211757]-challenge loge(expression) levels of the endpoint and these subject-specific pre- versus post-challenge changes in loge(expression) will be the units of analysis.  Analytical approach: The logarithmic transformed expression data of each anti-viral immunity endpoint (e.g. IFN-a) will be analyzed via a LMM.   LMM specification:  Two source of variability in the post-challenge changes in loge(expression) will be examined.  One source of variability will be the study-group (i.e. asthmatics, allergic rhinitis controls, and healthy-controls), while the other source will be the post-challenge day (i.e. challenge study days 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7).   Variability in the post-challenge changes in loge(expression )of the endpoint due to inherent differences in the loge(expression) of the endpoint on challenge study day 0 (baseline) will be extracted from the residual error to increase statistical power. Random effects:  Subject-specific and time-specific random effects will be incorporated into the LMM to allow intra-subject measurement correlation to be accounted for in variance estimation and hypothesis testing.  Hypothesis testing:  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_868424]-group comparisons will be focused on the post-challenge day 3 and day 4 changes in loge(expression) when peak symptoms are expected to occur.  Baseline (i.e. challenge study day 0) adjusted day 3 and day 4 mean changes in loge(expression) will be compared in a pairwise manner between the 3 different study-groups.  In order to maintain an intraday experimental type I error rate 0.05, a Bonferroni corrected two-sided p≤0.05/[ADDRESS_1211758]-challenge day 1, 2, and 7 between-group comparisons of the changes in loge(expression) will be consider as secondary comparisons, and the same hypothesis testing procedures will be employed to conduct these between-group comparisons.   Within-group related hypotheses will also be considered as secondary hypotheses.   Scale of interpretation:  The point estimates and 95% confidence interval limits for the between-group and the within-group comparisons of mean loge(expression) will be exponentiated so that the between-group comparisons and the within-group comparisons of the anti-viral immunity expression can be interpreted as a ratio of geometric means.     Analysis of nasal biopsy samples:  Post-challenge day 4  nasal biopsy samples will be evaluated for % of infected cells and amongst the cells whether they display evidence of apoptosis (annexin V positive) or necrosis (PI [CONTACT_95570]).  Analytic approach: Since the underlying distributions of these cell characteristics are complicated, we will use distribution-free permutation tests to conduct the between-group comparisons.  Hypothesis testing:  Based on the pseudo permutation test null distribution, a Bonferroni corrected two-sided p≤0.05/3 decision rule will be utilized as the null hypothesis rejection rule for the between-group comparisons.   Bivariate correlation analyses: As secondary analyses, we intend to examine bivariate relationships between several of the outcome variables.  As one example, we intend to examine bivariate relationships between post-challenge day [ADDRESS_1211759]-challenge day 4 expression of Th2 immune deviating activity (IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP). As a second example, we intend to examine bivariate relationships between post-challenge day [ADDRESS_1211760]-challenge day 1, 2, 3, and day 4 innate expression of anti-immunity (IFN-a, ß-, l and IL-15).  Bivariate associations will be quantitatively expressed in terms of the non-parametric Spearman Rank correlation coefficient.  Since multiple hypotheses will be test, Bonferroni type I error rate corrections will be implemented in establishing the null hypothesis rejection rules.   13.4.5 Analyses of Exploratory Endpoint(s)/Outcome(s) Overview:   As listed in section 3.4, there will be several exploratory endpoints.  The majority of these endpoints will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_868485]. For continuous scaled variables the descriptive

Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211761] deviation, median, interquartile range, and the range; i.e. minimum and the maximum, of the empi[INVESTIGATOR_623438], while for categorical variables, the descriptive statistics will include category frequencies and percentages.  13.4.6 Descriptive Analyses  Not planned 13.5 Interim Analyses  Not planned for this study 13.6 Statistical Hypotheses  All of the hypotheses related to the primary and secondary outcomes will be two-sided.   Three types of hypothesis tests will be conducted.  The underlying motivation of one set of hypotheses (between-group comparisons) will be to examine if the distributions of the outcome random variable in the underlying study populations of the 3 study groups share the same location parameter value (e.g. mean, geometric mean).  The underlying motivation of a second set of hypotheses (within-group comparisons) will be to examine if the underlying distributions of the outcome random variable pre- and post- RV challenge share the same location parameter value, and the underlying motivation of a third set of hypotheses (bivariate-correlation) will be to examine if the bivariate correlation between two random outcome variables is zero.      Between-group comparisons: With regard to the between-group comparisons, for each primary and secondary outcome variable the central null hypothesis is that the location parameter values (i.e. means or geometric means) of underlying distributions of the 3 study populations (i.e. asthmatics, allergic rhinitis controls, healthy-controls) are the same, whereas the alternative hypothesis is that at the underlying distributions of the [ADDRESS_1211762] location parameter values that are not the same.     Within-group comparisons: With regard to the within-group comparisons, for each primary and secondary outcome variable the null hypothesis is that the underlying value of distribution location parameter (i.e. means or geometric means) is the same before and after RV-challenge, whereas the alternative hypothesis is that the underlying value of the distribution location parameter is not the same before and after RV-challenge.      Bivariate-correlation: With regard to bivariate correlation, the null hypothesis is that the underlying correlation between the two outcome random variables is zero, whereas the alternative hypothesis is that the underlying correlation between the two outcome random variables is non-zero.       13.7 Sample Size Considerations  Overview (Aim 1): The primary null hypotheses of Aim [ADDRESS_1211763]-challenge day-3 and day-4 changes in ex vivo IL-25 are the same for allergic asthmatics, allergic-rhinitis-controls, and health controls.   Hypothesis testing: To combine the post-challenge day-[ADDRESS_1211764] the “global” null hypothesis that irrespective of the study group, the mean pre- to post-challenge day-3 change in loge(IL-25) (i.e.  D loge(IL-25)[Day 3]= loge (IL-25Post [Day 3] ) – loge(IL-25Pre [Day 0]) ) is the same,  and irrespective of the study group, the  mean pre to post-challenge day-4 change in loge(IL-25)  (i.e. D loge(IL-25)[Day 4]= loge (IL-25Post [Day 4] ) – loge(IL-25Pre [Day 0])) is the same.  Scenario #1:  If this “global” null hypothesis fails to be rejected at the p≤0.[ADDRESS_1211765]-challenge day-4 between-group comparisons will be conducted.  Scenario #2:   If this “global” null 
University of Virginia Confidential Page 53 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/2021 hypothesis is rejected at the p≤0.[ADDRESS_1211766]-challenge day-3 mean D loge(IL-25)[Day 3] will be constructed to compare the mean D loge(IL-25)[Day 3]  between the [ADDRESS_1211767]-challenge day-4 mean D loge(IL-25)[Day 4] will be constructed to compare the mean  D loge(IL-25)[Day 4]  between the 3 study-populations.  Since under scenario # 2, three post-challenge day-3 between-group comparisons of mean D loge(IL-25)[Day 3will be conducted, a two-sided Bonferroni p≤0.05/3 decision rule will be utilized as the null hypothesis rejection criterion for this set of between-group comparisons.  Similarly, since under scenario #[ADDRESS_1211768]-challenge day-4 between-group comparisons will be conducted, a two-sided Bonferroni p≤0.05/3 decision rule will be utilized as the null hypothesis rejection criterion for this set of between-group comparisons.    Power analysis (AIM 1):  If [ADDRESS_1211769]-challenge IL-25 expression geometric mean (GM) ratios of any two study populations differ in magnitude by [CONTACT_2669] a factor of 1.14 (column 3 of Table II).    Effect- size terminology: Since the primary endpoint is loge(IL-[ADDRESS_1211770]-challenge) – loge(IL-25Pre-challenge),  this variable can be re-expressed as loge(IL-25Post-challenge/IL-25Pre-challlenge).  If we let μlog-Ratio =mean loge(IL-25Post/IL-25Pre), then    exp(µlog-Ratio)  is the geometric mean of IL-25Post/IL-25Pre (i.e. a geometric mean (GM) ratio).  The factor by [CONTACT_868486]-populations must differ in magnitude in order to have 0.[ADDRESS_1211771] the null hypothesis that the geometric mean ratio is same for the two study populations is what is reported in column 3 of Table II. Power analysis details: In computing the minimum detectable factor by [CONTACT_868487]-challenge ex vivo IL-[ADDRESS_1211772]  this difference we assumed: 1) that the correlation between the pre- and post-challenge ex vivo loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) will be no less than 0.30,  2) that the random variable for the pre-challenge to post-challenge day-3 change in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) (i.e. D loge(IL-25)[Day 3]) is normally distributed in all [ADDRESS_1211773]-challenge day-4 change in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) (i.e. D loge(IL-25)[Day 4]) is normally distributed in all 3 study populations,  3) that the between-subject standard deviations for the post-challenge day [ADDRESS_1211774]-challenge day 4 changes in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) (i.e. D loge(IL-25)[Day 3], and D loge(IL-25)[Day 4],  respectively ) is less than or equal to 0.12, and 4) that per post-challenge day (e.g.  post-challenge day-3) the experimental  type I error rate of the hypothesis testing procedure will be  less than or equal to 0.[ADDRESS_1211775] variance estimation:  The between-subject variability of 0.[ADDRESS_1211776]-challenge day-4 changes in loge(IL-25 qPCR expression) (i.e. D loge(IL-25)[Day 3], and D loge(IL-25)[Day 4],  respectively ) was derived from our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299].  Five asthmatics and [ADDRESS_1211777] deviation of loge(IL-25) was 0.[ADDRESS_1211778]-challenge change in loge(IL-25) (i.e. D loge(IL-25) ) was then computed using the formula: var(∆log!IL−25)=var(log!IL−25"#$%)+var(log!IL−25"&!)−2r∗var(log!IL−25"&!)!"∗var(log!IL−25"#$%)!"	, where var(logeIL-25Pre) was assumed equal to var(logeIL-25Post) = 0.010 and the within-

Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/[ADDRESS_1211779] correlation (r) between the  loge IL-25Pre and  the loge IL-25Post measurements was conservatively estimated as 0.30. Based on this set of assumptions the between-subject variability for D loge(IL-25) was 0.[ADDRESS_1211780] deviation for D loge(IL-25) was  (0.0144)1/2= 0.12.        Table II.

Overview (Aim 2): The primary null hypothesis of Aim [ADDRESS_1211782]-challenge day-4 geometric mean “cumulative RV load”[†] is the same for allergic asthmatics, allergic-rhinitis-controls, and the health controls.  Note that this is equivalent to testing if the post-challenge day-4 mean log10(cumulative RV load) is the same for allergic asthmatics, allergic-rhinitis-controls, and the health controls.  Hypothesis testing: To test the primary null hypothesis we will first conduct a [ADDRESS_1211783]-challenge day-4 means for log10 (cumulative RV load).  Scenario #1:  If this “global” null hypothesis fails to be rejected at the p≤0.05 significance level, then no pairwise between-group comparisons will be conducted.   Scenario #2:  if this “global” null hypothesis is rejected at the p≤0.05 significance level, then 3 linear contrasts of the log10 (cumulative RV load) means will be constructed to compare the mean loge(cumulative RV load) between the 3 study-populations.  Since under scenario #2 three hypothesis tests will be conducted, a two-sided Bonferroni p≤0.05/3 decision rule will be utilized as the null hypothesis rejection criterion to maintain an experimental type I error rate of 0.05.  †Definition:   Post-challenge day-4  “cumulative RV load” represents the sum of the post-challenge day-0, day-1, day-2, day-3, and day-4 RV loads.      
University of Virginia Confidential Page 55 of 62 
Response to RV Challenge in Asthma  Version 11.0/8/04/2021 Power analysis (AIM 2):  If [ADDRESS_1211784]-challenge days: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, we expect to have at least 0.[ADDRESS_1211785]-challenge day-4 geometric mean “cumulative RV load” if the underlying post-challenge day-4 “cumulative RV load” geometric means of two study populations differ in magnitude by [CONTACT_868490] 25 (column 3 of Table III).  Effect-size terminology:   Since the primary endpoint is log10 (cumulative RV load), a between-group comparison of mean loge (cumulative RV load) is simply Dµ= mean log10 (cumulative RV load)Group A - mean log10 (cumulative RV load)Group B.   Therefore, 10Dµ = geometric mean (cumulative RV load)Group A/ geometric mean (cumulative RV load)Group B, which is a  ratio of geometric means.  The factor [ADDRESS_1211786] the null hypothesis that the geometric mean day-4 “cumulative RV load” is the same for the two study- populations. Details: In computing the minimum detectable factor by [CONTACT_868491]-challenge day [ADDRESS_1211787] the null hypothesis that the two geometric means are equal we assumed: 1) that the random variable for post-challenge day-4  log10(cumulative RV load) is normally distributed in all 3 study populations, 2) that the between-subject  variability in  post-challenge day-4  log10(cumulative RV load) in standard deviation units is less than or equal to 1.32 in each study population, and 3) that the experimental  type I error rate of the test will be less than or equal to 0.[ADDRESS_1211788] variance estimation: The estimate of 1.[ADDRESS_1211789]-challenge day-4 log10 (cumulative RV load [virions]) in standard deviation units was derived from the day-[ADDRESS_1211790] HRV16 challenge log10 (cumulative RV load [virions]) measurements of 8 controls and 16 asthmatics who participated in a HRV16 challenge study that was conducted at the University of Virginia by [CONTACT_27156].

Documentation of source data is necessary for the reconstruction, evaluation and validation of clinical findings, observations and other activities during a clinical trial.  Data derived from source documents will be transferred to protocol-specific CRFs.  Source documents will include print-outs from spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007], qPCR machine, EIA, flow cytometer, clinical laboratory 14.2. Access to Source Data The site investigators and site staff will make all source data available to the DAIT/NIAID as well as to relevant health authorities.  Authorized representatives as noted above are bound to maintain the strict confidentiality of medical and research information that may be linked to identified individuals. 15. Protocol Deviations 15.1. Protocol Deviation Definitions Protocol Deviation – The investigators and site staff will conduct the study in accordance to the protocol; no deviations from the protocol are permitted.  Any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures constitutes a protocol deviation.  As a result of any deviation, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  Major Protocol Deviation (Protocol Violation) - A Protocol Violation is a deviation from the IRB approved protocol that may affect the subject's rights, safety, or well-being and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data.  In addition, protocol violations include willful or knowing breaches of human subject protection regulations, or policies, any action that is inconsistent with the NIH Human Research Protection Program’s research, medical, and ethical principles, and a serious or continuing noncompliance with federal, state, local or institutional human subject protection regulations, policies, or procedures.   Non-Major Protocol Deviation - A non-major protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures of a research protocol that does not have a major impact on the subject's rights, safety or well-being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data. 15.2. Reporting and Managing Protocol Deviations The study site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_393241], document and report protocol deviations as directed by [CONTACT_12925].  However, protocol deviations may also be identified during site monitoring visits or during other forms of study conduct review.   Upon determination that a protocol deviation has occurred, the study staff will a) notify the site Principal Investigator, b) if warranted, notify the NIAID Project Manager, and c) will complete a Protocol Deviation form. The DAIT/NIAID Medical Officer will make the decision as to whether the Deviation is major or not and what the impact of the Deviation on the study participant or the entire study may be.  Subjects may at their discretion choose to participate in all or only parts of this study.  If a subject chooses not to participate in all aspects of this study (e.g., nasal biopsies) that will not be considered a protocol deviation nor will it impair their ability to enroll and complete the study.

BACKGROUND  
The Pulse TX is  a medical  device  intended  to clear  the skin of benign,  
undesired  skin lesions  as an alternative  to surgery  and other  more  ablative  
methods  for removing  benign  lesions . The system  is designed  to deliver  a 
timed  series  of very low energy , high voltage  (lesser than  the voltage  of static  
electricit y) pulses  of a time length  between  100 and 750 nanoseconds  
(billionths )    of a second . The non-thermal  effect  on tissue takes  place  in a 
very shallow  depth  of skin directly  below  the sterile  treatment  tip. The device  
emits  significantly  less energy  than existing  laser, electro -surgery  or electro -
cautery  equipment . 
 
Extensive  in vitro  research  demonstrates  a stimulation  of a programmed cell  
death  called  apoptosis  in a treated  area, which  is one of the presumed  
mechanisms  for observations of clinical  and histologic  changes  t o  c e l l s  in 
multiple studies of in-vivo treated  tissue.  In animal  studies  with over [ADDRESS_241291]  been  demonstrated  to reduce  or 
eliminate  b e n i g n  tumors  with a c lin ic a lly  acceptable  margin  of safety.  
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_202225] 2012  with a similar  
version  of the Pulse TX  device,  with the findings  published  in Experimental  
Dermatology.  (See  Attachment  A) A total of ten basal  cell carcinomas  on 
the skin of three  Subjects  were  treated with a range  of settings.  Seven  of 
the ten lesions  were  free of basal  cells at the conclusion  of the study , two 
partially  resolve d, and one recurre d. No scars  were  visible  at the healed  
sites of any of the successfully  treated  lesions.

PURPOSE  AND  SCOPE  OF THE STUDY  
The primary  purpose  of the study  is to evaluate the use of the Pulse TX System 
when used to remove Seborrheic Keratosis  (SK) lesions from  the non -facial 
areas of healthy  adult subjects.  These benign skin lesions are frequently 
located on the limbs and/or trunk and not considered to be pre -canc erous. 
Patients routinely seek their removal for cosmetic/aesthetic reasons.  SK 
lesions are typi[INVESTIGATOR_202227] a scalpel, or dessication with a 
4  heat-based energy technology such as a laser or electrosurgery.   SKs do not 
self-resolve without treatment.   
STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
The specific objectives of the study are as follows:  
 
• Document  the non -treated  appearance of  off-face SK’s 
• Evaluate  the clearanc e of SK’s in off -face locations after removal using 
the Pulse TX System vs. pretreated appearance of the same lesion  
• Evaluate  the clearance  of the treated SK ’s at various  points  in time over  
several  weeks following the initial procedure, compared to the pre -treated 
SK’s  
 
PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
• The primary endpoint of the study is the degree of clearing of benign  SK 
lesions as rated by [CONTACT_202260]’s assessment of 
photographs of the lesions at the  final study visit.  
 
o A 4-point scale (0, 1, 2, 3) will be used wherein each lesion will be 
characterized as “Clear”, “Mostly Clear“, “Partially Clear”, “Not Clea r”.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o See Attachment C for a protocol specific to the Independent Review.  
 
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
• A secondary endpoint of the study is the degree of clearing  by [CONTACT_202261]’s assessment.  
 
o The same 4 -point scale will be used as that used for the Photographic 
Review.  Photographic Review of SK Lesions

• An additional secondary endpoint of the study is subject  satisfaction with 
the SK’s  area at the final study visit. A 5-point scale (0, 1, 2, 3 4) will be 
used wherein the Subject will be asked to rate their level of satisfaction 
with each SK area as “Satisfied”, “Mostly Satisfied”, “Partially Satisfied”, 
“Dissatisfied” Highly Dissatisfied”.

SUCCESS CRITERIA  
• Independent Reviewer Assessment  of Photograph :  A score of “0” or 
“1” at the last follow -up will represent a successful outcome for that 
lesion.    The study will be considered a success if 65% of treated 
lesions are reduced by a score of 2 or more points on the lesion 
scale  
• Physician Assessment: A score of “0” or “1” at the last follow -up will 
represe nt a successful outcome for that lesion.   Success for this 
criteria is 65% of lesions rate d as a 0 or 1 on the scale.  
• Patient Assessment: A score of “0” or “1” at the last follow -up will 
represent a successful outcome for that lesion.   Success for this 
criteria will be 65% of lesion areas evaluated as “Satisfied” or “Mostly 
Satisfied”.  
• The overall study will be considered a success if [ADDRESS_241293] serves as his or her own control will be employed.  A 
Principle Investigator will be identified at each of up to five participating sites.  A 
total of up to 60 Subjects will be consented and enrolled with anticipated 
enrollment expe cted to be uniformly distributed across sites. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_202228].   
No significant  risk is posed  by [CONTACT_202262]. While safety  can never  be taken  lightly,  this study  is not 
meant  to measur e, monitor  or analyze  any significant  disease  or disorder for 
which medical treatment is mandatory . (See  additional  information regarding  
Non-Significant  Risk statement  in the following  pages .) 
 
ANALYTICAL METHODS  
Three sets of data will be analyzed:  
1. Clinical observational data as derived from the examinations.  
2. Data captured during the photograph review process.  
3. Patient self -reported symptoms and observational data.  
 
The statistical analysis for this single -arm NSR study will be performed after 
collection of safety, effectiveness and secondary outcomes during th e baseline 
period and each evaluation interval.  
  
• Analysis of primary endpoints in intent -to-treat population  
• Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints in the per protocol population  
• The calculation of the change from baseline in the treated lesion siz e and 
appearance will be adjusted by [CONTACT_202263]  
• Exploratory Data Analysis to describe distributions and to explore trending  
• Repeated measures ANOVA or non -parametric equivalent to compare 
means  
• Likelihood ratio statistics to assess categorical data  
• Chi-Square Tests to compare binary proportions  
• Exact probabilities will be computed for any inferential analysis performed  
• 95% confidence levels will be calculated using exact methods  
• Agreement statistics to estimate the inter - and intra -photographic reviewer 
variability  
• All analysis will be adjusted for the correlated nature of the data since more 
than one lesion is being sampled from the host subject  
 
7  All tables and listings will be produced and stored in SAS datasets.  No data 
imputations will be performed.

DEVICE  DESCRIPTION  
The Pulse  TX System  consists  of an electrical  pulse  generator  (similar  to 
devices  used  to electro -coagulate  tissue)  combined  with a hand -pi[INVESTIGATOR_202229].  The 
hand -pi[INVESTIGATOR_202230] a sterile , single  patient -use treatment  tip. The tip has 
an array  of pi[INVESTIGATOR_202231] 1.27 mm in diameter  (18 gauge)  which  
penetrate the  skin between  1 and 3 mm. Power  settings  within  a minimum  
and maximum  range  are available  for selection  by [CONTACT_202044] n, and are 
software  limited  to defined setting for each treatment tip  by [CONTACT_456] . Once  
the electrical  pulse  generator  is turned  on and a power  setting  is selecte d, a 
foot switch  triggers  a sequence  of pre-programmed  electrical  pulses  to an 
area of skin directly  beneath  the treatment  tip.  
 
A common  commercially  available  sterile  coupling  gel is applied  to the skin 
or treatment  tip surface to  ensure  good  electrical  coupling  to the tissue . 
 
The three  system  components  are as follows : 
 
1. Pulse  Generator  including  a built-in touch  screen  for setting  selection,  
a power cord,  and a mandatory  foot pedal  for activation  of a pulsing  
sequence  
2. Hand -pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]  (re-usable)  
3. Single  patient -use Tip (five different  versions  available,  described  
below)

[ADDRESS_241306] been reviewed in a detailed histologic analysis.  The treatment intervals 
of the targeted normal abdominal tissue ranged from 10 hours to 60 days prior to a 
previously scheduled abdominoplasty procedure in which the treated tissue was 
demarcated six months prior to excision.   Six treatment energy levels are reviewed per 
patient per time interval.   Various tissue staining techniques intended to identify 
specific cellular changes and tissue morphology were utilized in the histologic analysis 
to characterize the initial tissue responses and the subsequent recovery processes, 
and sequential findings for each of the six energy levels were compared to normal 
control punch biopsies in the same patient.

In many patients, hair follicles and eccrine glands within the dermal layer of the skin

19  Alterations of dermal collagen :  Alterations in the dermal collagen observed were 
minimal, with no evidence of thermal injury.  In several tissue samples exposed to 
treatment levels five and six, there was focal papi[INVESTIGATOR_202249].  This 
effect was observed at the [ADDRESS_241311] energy level, there was some 
parallel fibrosis of the dermal collagen bundles at 60 days.  
 
Elastic tissue staining :  Elastic tissue remained in tact in the vast majority of patients.  
In treatment levels 4, [ADDRESS_241312] in treatment level 6.  
 
Melanocytic density :  The number of melanocytes was observed using a MITF 
immunostain.  Staining for melanocytes shows a marked loss of melanocytes in the 
treatment areas at day one.  By [CONTACT_4475] 15 the number of melanocytes return to normal 
density, comparable to the control specimens.  This was observed through 60 days .  
The rapid return of the melanocytic density to levels comparable to control should be 
consistent with a relative normalization of skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_202250] :  The number of dermal fibroblasts appear to decrease at day 1 
and day 5.  However, by [CONTACT_4475] 15, 30 and 60 the number of dermal fibroblasts was 
equivalent to pretreatment samples.  This suggests a temporary decrease in the 
number of dermal fibroblasts after treatment and possibly some loss of dermal 
fibroblasts secondary to the tre atment.  However, fibroblasts are recruited from normal 
surrounding skin and peripheral circulation and the population of fibroblasts returned 
to levels similar to the control in the 15 -60 day time period. This finding suggests a 
recovery of fibroblasts an d the associated normal capacity to rebuild connective tissue.  
 
Apoptosis :  Measurement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_202251] -histochemical stains to active Caspace 3. This analysis shows no significant 
expression within the epi[INVESTIGATOR_202252] [ADDRESS_241313] -treatment time frames tested.  
These findings do not provide clear evidence of apoptotic cell death during the 
analyzed time frames.   Therefore, the precise mechanism for the observation of “ghost 
cells” and associated cell death was  not identifiable by [CONTACT_115564].  
 
 
 
 
 
20  Inflammation : Overall, the degree of dermal inflammation was minimal compared to 
other thermal or physical methods of intentionally damaging surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_202253].  
There is a small amount of inflammation seen at da y [ADDRESS_241314] 
on healing.  
 
Summary :  The novel method of using low energy nano -pulse cellular stimulation on 
skin and subcutaneous tissue at six different ener gy settings was observed to lead to 
a predictable loss of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_202254].  The lack of observed effect on dermal collagen suggest that the effect 
is non -thermal, with a relatively low level of infl ammation given the amount of epi[INVESTIGATOR_202255].    This lack of inflammatory effect is consistent with preservation of fibroblasts, 
elastin, and melanocyte recovery.  The transient effect on deeper cellular structures in 
the dermis suggest an affinity of na nopulse energy for highly cellular tissue, and a 
sparing effect on the less cellular connective tissue of the collagen layer .

STUDY PROTOCOL  
BACKGROUND  
The NanoPulse System  is a medical  device  intended  to create a controlled non -
thermal reduction or clearing of targeted tissue areas  as an alternative  to excisional 
surgery  and other  more  thermally ablative  methods  for removing  undesired tissue 
or cells . The system  deployed  in the study  is designed  to deliver  a timed  series  of 
very low energy , high voltage  (similar  to the voltage  of static  electricit y) pulses  of a 
time length  between  100 and 750 nanoseconds  (billionth s) of a second.  The non-
thermal  effect  takes  place  in a shallow  depth  of tissue  directly  below  the sterile  
treatment  tip. The device  emits  significantly  less energy  than other currently used  
electro -surgery  or electro -cautery  equipment.   
 
In several well -designed animal studies , nano -pulsed  devices  have  been  
demonstrated  to reduce  or eliminate  skin tumors  with an acceptable  margin  of 
safety.  An NSR  pi[INVESTIGATOR_202257] 
[ADDRESS_241316] objective is to confirm that reported ratings are reproducible over time when 
considering one reviewer’s ratings at two different times so the agreement between the 
two time intervals should be at least 80%  
 
2nd objective is to confirm that reported ratings are reproducible when considering 
responses among 3 reviewer’s rat ings when each is compared to the other two so the 
agreement between and among the reviews should be at least 80%  
 
REVIEWER SELECTION  
 Not affiliated with the study  
2-3 reviewers  qualified by [CONTACT_202267] & SET UP  
• For each lesion in each of the [ADDRESS_241317] all images to be reviewed at all time points  according to uniform criteria  
• Images will be masked to time interval, energy settings, size of treatment 
tip,and specific subject identifiers.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
24  STUDY PROCESS  
MATERIALS NEEDED  
1.  Set of photographs (Training/Reference Set) to be given to each of 
the reviewers  
• One set of images representing each  SK lesion rating 
option and labeled with the rating it represents  
• One set of images representing  each of the skin 
characteristics to be rated  
• Narrative description of each of the rating options  
• No time intervals displayed  
• No energy settings displayed  
 
2.  Set of phot ographs (Scoring Set) to be given to each of the reviewers  
• Images are restricted to those taken at each of the visit 
intervals i.e., [ADDRESS_241318] initial treatment  
• Images do not include those displayed in Training Set  
• Narrative description of each of the rating options  
• No time intervals displayed  
• No energy settings displayed  
 
3.  Set of photographs ( V/V Set) to be given to each of the reviewers  
• Redistribute, rearrange images for at least 50% of the 
randomly ch osen images  
• Renumber image identifiers  
 
REVIEWER TRAINING  
The training session may be done in person or via use  of electronic 
communication and media formats.  Steps to be taken for the training 
session are as follows:  
• Send Training/Reference Set of images to reviewer  
• Set up telephone training session (options: Go to Meeting or similar).  
Should take about 15 -30 m inutes  
• Use c onsistent trainer for each reviewer session  
• Reviewer to keep Training/Reference Set of images to use as 
reference  during the Review session  
• Trainer to document time, date, location, attendees , communication 
format  and the topi[INVESTIGATOR_139431], etc.  
 
25  REVIEWER SESSION  
The Review session may be done in person or via use of electronic 
communication and media formats.  Steps to be taken for the Review 
Sessions are as follows:  
• Send Scoring Set of images to reviewer  
• Set up telephone call (options: Go to Me eting or similar). Should take 
about 10 minutes to assure understanding of process  
• Use c onsistent contact [CONTACT_202268]  
• Set up deadline date for completion of the review  
• Contact [CONTACT_202269], date, loca tion, attendees, topi[INVESTIGATOR_202258].  
• Instruct the Reviewer to return the Scored set of images  but retain 
the Training/Reference set  
VALIDATION SESSION   
The Validation session may be done in person or via use of electronic 
communication and media formats.  Steps to be taken for the Validation 
Sessions are as follows:  
• Send V & V Set  of images  to Reviewers  
• Set up telephone call (options: Go to Meeting or si milar). Should take 
about 10 minutes to assure understanding of process  
• Use c onsistent contact [CONTACT_202268]  
• Set up deadline date for completion of the review  
• Contact [CONTACT_202269], date, location, attendees, topi[INVESTIGATOR_202259], and c ommunication format.  
• Instruct the Reviewer to return all study materials  
NOTE:  Inter- and intra -rater reliability tests are done to confirm that…  
1.  a reviewer can look at the same image at two different times 
and consistently rate the characteristic in bot h instances. (Intra -
rater Reliability) and  
2. reviewers are in agreement with each other when they rate the 
same characteristics under the same circumstances and 
looking at the same images (Inter -rater Reliability)

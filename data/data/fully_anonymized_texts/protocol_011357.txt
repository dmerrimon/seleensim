HTX- 009 is a sterile, viscous, extended r elease formulation of meloxicam  only to be locally administered into 
the surgical site for the prevention of postoperative pain.  
The vehicle formulation for HTX -011-49, HTX -011-56, HTX -002, and HTX -009 comprises tri[ethylene glycol] 
based poly[orthoester] polymer with dimethyl sulfoxide , glycerol triacetate, and maleic acid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and analgesic efficacy of doses of HTX -011 of 200 mg or 
lower , HTX- 002 of 200 mg  or lower , and doses of HTX -009 of 4.1 mL  or lower in subjects following  unilateral 
bunionectomy.  HTX- 011, HTX -002 and HTX -009 formulations will be supplied by [CONTACT_888541].  
For both HTX -011-49 and HTX -011-56, the content of active ingredients  per volume  is identic al: 
4.1 mL = 119.9 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 3.59 mg of meloxicam; 6.84 mL = 200.1 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 6.0 mg of

two formulations of HTX -011 differ from each oth er in their respective quantities of the vehicle excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
HTX- 002 is an identical formulation as that of HTX -011-56 except that it contains only bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (at the 
same concentration) as the active pharmaceutical ingredient.  
The content of active ingredients per volume in HTX -009 is 4.1 mL of meloxicam.  
Reference therapy:  Normal saline and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40473] (Marcaine).  Both will be procured by [CONTACT_21127].  
Duration of treatment: Each subject is planned to  receive a single dose of study medication in divided 
aliquots.  
Overview:  This study is designed to evaluate the safety and analgesic efficacy  of multiple formulation s of 
HTX- 011, HTX -002, and HTX -009 at doses not to exceed 6.84 mL (200 mg)  in subjects foll owing unilateral 
bunionectomy.  Efficacy assessments are intended to characterize the analgesic effect time curve and the 
magnitude o f analgesic effect of HTX -011, HTX -002, and HTX -009 in comparison with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 
(Marcaine) and normal saline.  In addition, the study will further characterize the s afety and PK profiles of 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_888495] -011, HTX -002, HTX -009 and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . 
Subjects will participate in the screening visit within 28 days of the scheduled surge ry. ASA classification and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for eligibility to participate in the study will be assessed.  Medical history, vital 
signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, drug and alcohol screening, 12- lead ECG , collection of 
prior /concomitant medications, and a serum pregnancy test will b e performed. PONV risk factors will be 
assessed , and subject will be trained on providing pain intensity assessment s. 
On the day of surgery, Day 0, subjects will be reassessed for eligibility.  No epi[INVESTIGATOR_888496], nor will any local anesthetic infiltration other than the administration of the IP or control be permitted.  
No prophylactic antiemetic, local anesthetics, or analgesic medications are allowed other than those used for

1994).  Medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_888503] a relatively simple 
and safe means to reduce post -operative pain ( Moiniche, Mikkelsen et al. 1998).  The major 
limitation of the current local anesthetics is the limited duration of effect (6  to 12 hours) that 
is observed following surgery ( Kehlet and Andersen 2011).  In recent years there has been a 
dramatic increase in day -case surgery.  In this patient population it is estimated that 30 to 40% 
of the patients suffer from moderate to severe pain during the first 24 to 48 hours. The 
development of a long-acting local anesthetic formulation for this patient population would be of clinical significance ( Rawal 2001 ). 
While non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been used in the treatment 
of post- operative pain ( Moote 1992), there is early evidence that there may be a synergistic 
interaction betw een local anesthetics and non -steroidal anti -inflammatory compounds when 
locally administered ( Ortiz, Castañeda-Hernández et al. 2011).  The Sponsor has identified a 
combination of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_888504] s 
(HTX -011-49 and HTX-011-56), intended for the management of post-operative pain via 
wound infiltration , that  have demonstrated positive results in a non-clinical model of post-
surgical pain. Th ese formulations have been selected fo r further clinical investigation. Both 
HTX-011-[ADDRESS_1243528] vehicle formulations comprising tri[ethylene glycol] based poly[orthoester] polymer with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol triacetate, and maleic acid. The two 
formulations differ from each other in their respective quantities  of the vehicle excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] .  
The Sponsor has also developed a formulation , HTX-002, which is identical in 
pharmaceutical composition to HTX-011-56 except  that it contain s only bupi[INVESTIGATOR_888505] (API).  Therefore, the HTX -[ADDRESS_1243529] ic pi[INVESTIGATOR_888506] -over 
PK studies in the beagle dogs demonstrate that the primary pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic ( PK) characteristics of HTX -002 are similar to that of HTX-011-56. Both

The following sections summarize the three phases of activities for this study: 
1) Pretreatment Phase, 2) Treatment  and Confinement Phase, and 3) Follow -up Phase.  
4.1.1. Pretreatment Phase (Day -28 to Day -1) 
Subjects will be consented and screened during this phase by [CONTACT_888546]  6.5. The screening period will be at any time between Day -28 and Day -1. 
4.1.2. Treatment and Confinement Phase ( Day 0 through Day 5) 
a. Pre-surgery (Day 0 ): Subjects will be admitted to the surgical unit an d reassessed 
for eligibility to continue participation in  the study.  Standard  pre-surgery activities 
will be conducted once eligibility has been re- confirmed . 
b. Surgery (Day 0 ): Subjects will undergo primary unilateral first metatarsal 
bunionectomy procedure via propofol sedation and regional local anesthesia via a 
Mayo block technique utilizing 1% lidocaine without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. A standard 
anesthetic regimen will be followed for all subjects as outlined in Section  5.5.1. 
Upon completion of the  bunionectomy , a single dose of study drug ( ie, any one of 
HTX-011-49, HTX-011-56, HTX-002, HTX -009, Marcaine, or normal saline, 
according to random  assignment ) will be administered by [CONTACT_888547]/instillation  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Start and stop time s of dos e administration 
will be recorded.  Dosing stop time will be considered as T0. 
c. Postoperative Period (Days 0–5): Following surgery, subjects will be trans ferred to

concentrations over [ADDRESS_1243545] -
time curve of HTX-011, HTX-002, and HTX-009 compared with  Marcaine and  with  normal 
saline  following a surgical procedure. In addition, the study will further characterize the 
safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39881].  Based on the overall PI, 
PK and safety data from the  study cohorts, the optimum administration technique for HTX-
011, HTX-002, and HTX-009 will be decided: the methodology will be de tailed  in the 
statistical analysis plan for this study.

commode, or bathroom privileges via wheelchair through completion of 12-hour 
assessments; bathroom privileges may be loosened at any time at the discretion of the 
investigator.  While confined at the study clinic following surgery, subject s will be required to 
remain resting in bed at least  [ADDRESS_1243555] postoperative care instructions. 
5.5. Surgical Procedure  
On the day of surgery (Day 0 ), subject s will undergo primary unilateral first metatarsal 
bunionectomy without collateral procedures. The surgery should be completed using the 
Austin bunion procedure with internal fixation; use of other procedures including base wedge procedures is not acceptable as part of this study protocol. Surgeries should be scheduled to accommodate induction of anesthesia so that all surgical procedures can  be completed by 
[CONTACT_3450] 5 :00 pm on the day of surgery. 
5.5.1. Anesthesia and Study Drug Administration  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Anesthesia for Surgery  
The anesthetic protocol described below should be followed to minimize inter- subject  
variability owing to administration of these agents. However, it is understood that 
hemodynamic fluctuations and other intraoperative events may necessitate some deviation from the standard regimen to ensure that necessary measures are undertaken to preserve subject safety . 
The surgery will be performed under regional anesthesia. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_888514] . The surgical procedure should be limited to a maximum duration of 120 minutes 
with a target duration ≤ [ADDRESS_1243556] suture.  A pneumatic ankle tourniquet 
inflated between 150 and 250 mmHg may be applied to achieve h emostasis.  
A single dose of fentanyl 100 μg IV and/or midazolam up to 5 mg IV  may be administered, 
as part of the pre-anesthesia induction procedure, at the investigator/anesthesiologist’s discretion. A small dose of lidocaine (up to 5 mL of 1% lidocaine without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) may also be administered i nitially to reduce venous irritation at the propofol injection site.  MAC 
sedation with propofol will be initiated utilizing propofol either as an infusion or as a slow injection method. An initial slow IV  propofol 0.5 mg/kg bolus dose may be followed by 
[CONTACT_5640] a) a maintenance IV propofol infusion at 0.025–0.075 mg/kg/min, or b) incremental IV

Heron Therapeutics  Confidential  propofol bolus doses of 10–[ADDRESS_1243557].  Administration of 
propofol infusion (if utilized) may be discontinued prior to completion of the surgery, at the 
discretion of the investigator/anesthesiologist. 
Initiation of p ropofol sedation will be followed by [CONTACT_888548] ( up to 20 mL 
of 1% lidocaine without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) via the Mayo block technique ( Worrell and Barbour 
1996) to facilitate the necessary regional anesthesia for the bunionectomy procedure. The 
surgical procedure itself will proceed in accordance with the standard accepted clinical 
practice and preferences of the surgical team.  
Agents for nausea prophylaxis, including 5- HT3 receptor blockers  (eg, ondansetron), 
scopolamine, dexameth asone, or haloperidol, are prohibited during or upon completion of the 
surgical procedure. Anti-nausea medication will only be administered during the post-
operative period for any of the following: ( 1) subject  reco rds a score of ≥ 5 on the nausea 
numeric rating scale; (2) subject  is actively vomiting; (3) subject  requests anti -nausea 
medication.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Drug Administration 
Before any study drug can be administered, at  least [ADDRESS_1243558] elapsed after the 
lidocaine was administered for the Mayo block. The s tart and stop time s of study drug dosing 
will be recorded  in the CRF. Study drug dosing stop time will be considered as time 0 (T0).  
Details of an administration will be recorded on a worksheet which will be used in the dictation of the surgical notes and will become part of the source document. 
Administration of study drug for the t hree techniques in this study will be as follows: 
Closed wound infiltration (Cohorts A, C, E, F, G, I , K, O, S, X, Y, Z1, Z3, Z5, and Z7 ): 
Following skin closure, and w hile maintaining a sterile environment, the study drug will be 
administered in a Mayo  Block -type administration in accordance with the guidance provided 
in the study Pharmacy Manual.  A ring of medication is injected at the proximal aspect of the first interspace, to maximal 
depth, across the dorsal metatarsal base, and along the medial aspect of the first metatarsal 
base.  An injection is then placed across the plantar metatarsal base, to  maximal depth, to 
complete the ring.  A similar ring of study drug is then administered at the level of the first 
metatarsal phalangeal joint .  
Open wound infiltration (Cohorts B , D, H, J, L,N, P, R, T, U, Z2 , Z4, Z6, Z8, and Z9):  
The study drug will be  administered throughout the tissue planes to ensure equal distribution 
across the surgical field . The medication should form rings of anesthetic around both the 
proximal and distal aspects of the metatarsal.  An appropriate way of doing this is as follows: 
• Start proximal to the bony incision and administer half the contents of the [ADDRESS_1243559] the bony incision (blue arrows below)

Heron Therapeutics  Confidential  • Repeat the procedure with the rest of the syringe but now start distally and inject  
proximally (red arrows below) 
• Adequate saturat ion of all exposed tissues in the surgical field  will be ensured  
• Thereafter , skin closure will commence to complete the surgical procedure.  
Local administration via instillation (Cohort M, A1, A2 , and A3 ) 
The study drug will be administered throughout the deep tissue planes to ensure equal 
distribution across the surgical field.  The medication should form rings of anesthetic around 
both the proximal and di stal aspects of the metatarsal.  Care must be taken to ensure adequate 
exposure of the proximal and distal ends ( ie, beyond the bony incision) of the wound to study 
drug. To ensure adequate saturation of all exposed tissues in the surgical field, it may be 
necessary to administer study drug in layers.  Thereafter, skin closure will commence to 
complete the surgical procedure.

[CONTACT_888549] .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. HTX -011 and HTX -002 Dose Calculation 
For both HTX -011-49 and HTX -011-56, the content of active ingredients per volume is 
identical : 4.1 mL = 119.9 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 3.59 mg of meloxicam; 6.84 mL HTX -011-49 
(or HTX -011-56) = 200.1 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 6.0 mg of meloxicam ; A lower volume with a 
corresponding lower dose of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_888494]. The calculated  dose for HTX -002 is such that 6.84 mL HTX -002 = 200.[ADDRESS_1243564] s to Treatment Groups  
A computer generated randomization scheme will be prepared prior to study initiation. 
Subjects in Cohorts A through F will be randomly assigned to treatment with  any one of  
HTX-011-49, HTX-011-56, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Marcaine) , or normal saline in a 1:1:1:1:1:1  
assignment . All study doses administered will be according to the original treatment 
assignment.  Subjects in Cohorts G, H, I, and J will be assigned randomly on a 1:1:1:1 basis. 
Subjects in Cohorts K, L, M, and N will be assigned randomly on a 1:1:1:1 basis. Subjects in 
Cohorts O, P, and R will be assigned randomly on a 1:1:1 basis. Subjects in Cohorts S, T,

randomly on a 2:2:1:1:1 basis. Subjects in Cohorts A1, A2 and A3 will be assigned randomly 
on a 3:3:1 basis.  
5.7. Selection of Doses  
In a placebo -controlled Phase 1 clinical trial, single d oses of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg of 
HTX-011-19 (another different formulation of the HTX-011 combination of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_888518]) , and single doses of [ADDRESS_1243565] -time 
curve of the two HTX-011 formulations, the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110762] -only formulation (HTX-002) and 
the meloxicam -only formulation (HTX-009) , this study will evaluate the analgesic effects  of 
multiple formulations of HTX -011, HTX -002, and HTX-009 at doses not to exceed 6.84 mL 
(200 mg) in  subjects foll owing unilateral bunionectomy. 
5.8. Blinding and Unbl inding of Study Medications 
Because HTX-011, HTX -002, and HTX-[ADDRESS_1243566] 
to Marcaine and normal saline , this renders obsolete any double-blinded study drug 
administration.  Therefore, the site’s surgical and pharmacy staff will not be blinded to the 
study medication administered.  However, the conduct of the study will be observer blind. 
Once surgery is completed and the subject has been transferred to the post- anesthesia 
recovery  area, all site staff in the cl inical unit involved in the safety and efficacy assessments 
will be blinded to the treatment assignment, and (s)he will remain masked to treatment 
assignments throughout the conduct of this study. 
The study blind may be broken only if the safety of a subje ct is at risk and the treatment plan 
for that subject depends on which study medication he or she received. If knowledge of the 
treatment assignment is absolutely necessary for the management of a subject’s safety, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_888550]. If subject’s 
treatment assignment is  unblinded without the prior knowledge of the Sponsor, the 
investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible and no later than the next business 
morning. All circumstances lead ing to the premature unblinding must be clearly documented. 
5.9. Treatment Compliance  
Because the study medication is being administered as a component of the surgical 
procedure, a lack of treatment compliance is not expected.  The exact date, start and stop

Heron Therapeutics  Confidential  7. ADVERSE EVENTS  (AE s), SERIOUS AE s, AND SERIOUS SUSPECTED 
ADVERSE REACTIONS  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
criteria and definition of an AE, SAE, or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction (SSAR) as provided in this protocol. During the study, when there is a safety evaluation, the investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting AEs and SAEs, as detailed in this section of the protocol. 
7.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a d rug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not considered causally associated with the use of the study medication. Any abnormal laboratory value deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_093], regardless of causal relationship, must be reported as an AE. 
Examples of an AE include the following: 
• significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication 
under study 
• exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the condition ( eg, abnormal physical examination 
finding) 
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction 
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study medication or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, 
unless nonserious or serious sequelae occur)  
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
• medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE 
• anticipated day to day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) (including 
laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
• the disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease or disorder being studied, unless they becom e more severe or occur with a 
greater frequency than expected for the subject’s condition 
• transient paresthesia that are considered to be clinically normal (would be expected to occur as a long -acting local anesthetic wears off)  
All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination and regardless of 
causality or seriousness, will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF beginning after 
Protocol No: HTX -011-C2016 -[ADDRESS_1243598] . 
7.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any event that meets the following criteria:  
• It results in death or is life -threatening ( ie, presents an immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred).  (This criterion is not intended to include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.) 
• It results in persistent or substantial disability or incapacitation.  (This criterion is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, diarrhea, or sprained ankle.)  
• It results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It results in prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• It is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• It requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an AE is serious when considering important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196439]. Examples of such medical events that may also be considered serious include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from baseline does not meet the definition of an SAE. 
Social or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137541] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_888527]. 
7.2.1. Serious Adverse Events That Occur Before Administration of Study 
Medication  
Before administration  of study medication, only SAEs assessed by [CONTACT_888558] (ie , related to study procedures or a change in existing therapy) will be 
transcribed onto the SAE reporting form and reported to the sponsor. 
7.2.2. Serious Adverse Events That Occur After Study Completion  
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE or death that occurs in a subject more than 
[ADDRESS_1243599]’s last study visit, and that investigator considers the event to be 
related to the study medication, the investigator is obligated to report the SAE to the sponsor 
as outlined in Section  7.7. 
Protocol No: HTX -011-C2016 -208 Page 53 of 81 
Version 7  
 
 
Heron Therapeutics  Confidential  7.3. Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction)  
A suspected adverse reaction  is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257]. For the purposes of IND 
safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship be tween the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a 
lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
7.4. Definition of a Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction (SSAR)  
A SSAR is any SAR that is determined to be serious, based on the outcomes of a SAE described in Section  7.2; ie , death, life-threatening, causes or prolongs inpati ent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], causes a persistent of significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital abnormality/birth defect. 
7.5. Recording and Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The i nvestigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, 
symptoms, or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs 
or symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE. 7.5.1. Assessment of Intensit y 
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study, using his or her clinical judgment. The intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF should be assigned to one of the following categories: 
• mild: an  event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and 
does not interfere with everyday activities  
• moderate: an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities  
• severe: an event that prevents nor mal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a term used 
to describe the intensity of a specific event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a 
severe headache).  This is not the same as serious, which is based on the subject’s or event’s 
outcome or on action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning (see Section  7.1 and Se ction  7.2).  
7.5.2. Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to use his or her clinical judgment to assess the relationship between the study medication and the occurrence of each AE or SAE.  For t his study, adverse 
events that are considered by [CONTACT_95334] a Possible, Probable, or Definite relationship to the investigational product are considered to be “related” to the investigational product; unlikely and unrelated are considered to be “not related” to the investigational 
Protocol No: HTX -011-C2016 -[ADDRESS_1243600]. Sponsor assessment of causality may differ from Investigator assessment in 
accordance with FDA guidance, Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE studies: 
• Definitely Related: An AE has a strong tempo ral relationship to the study drug.  The 
AE is most likely explained by [CONTACT_5349].  Dechallenge and rechallenge (if possible) 
are positive.  The AE is consistent with a known response to the study drug. Another 
etiology is unlikely or significantly less like ly. 
• Probably Related: An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug. The 
AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_137581]. Dechallenge (if 
performed) is positive. 
• Possibly Related: An AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug. The 
AE could have been due to another equally likely cause. Dechallenge is positive.  
• Unlikely Related: An SE does not follow a temporal relationship to study drug. The 
AE can be explained due to study factors. 
• Not Related: The subject did not receive the study drug OR the AE has no temporal 
relationship to study drug OR the AE has a much more likely alternate etiology OR the AE is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another drug. 
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it is important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before transmitting the SAE reporting form and completing the AE eCRF page(s). The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and amend the SAE reporting form and AE eCRF page(s) accordingly. 
7.5.3. Assessment of Outcome  
All SAEs must be followed until they are resolved, the condition stabilizes, the events are 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. The investigator will assess the 
outcome of the event by [CONTACT_137582]: 
• Resolved: The event resolved or  the subject recovered without sequelae. An event 
(either serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject experienced no restrictions.  Examples include stent placement for coronary artery 
disease (a device implanted is not a sequela), an appendectomy (a scar is not a 
sequela), a postoperative wound infection, or an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. 
• Resolved with sequelae: The event has at least one secondary outcome that may result 
in permanent disability, functional limitation, or both. Such sequelae are usually 
limited to SAEs.  Examples include hip replacement resulting in foot drop (foot drop 
is not the intended outcome but is a risk of surgery), stroke resulting in paralysis, or 
emboli formation after a bacterial infection resulting  in a renal infarct and loss of 
renal function. 
• Not resolved: At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in 
intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the outcome is unknown.  
Examples include headache, low- grade fever, or nausea.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-C2016 -208 Page 55 of 81 
Version 7  
 
 
Heron Therapeutics  Confidential  • Unknown: The subject has withdrawn from the study prematurely or is lost to follow -
up, and the status of the event is unknown. 
• Death  
7.6. Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit until an appropriate 
resolution can be documented. 
After the occurrence of an AE or SAE, the investigator is required to follow each subject 
proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition. All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit or contact [CONTACT_196482]. 
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. The investigator will ensure that follow -up 
information provided to the sponsor includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the nature of the event, the cause of the event, or both. 
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE reporting 
form and entered into the eCRF pages, with all changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_093].  
The updated SAE reporting form should be resubmitted to the sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section  7.7. 
7.7. Prom pt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor  
Once the investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE, he or she must notify the sponsor within [ADDRESS_1243601] BE REPORTED TO THE SPONSOR IMMEDIATELY (within 24 hours).

• medical history  
• prior and concomitant medications 
Also, the following documents are to be forwarded: any labo ratory results, diagnostic test 
results, or medical reports relevant to the SAE. 
E-mail transmission is the preferred method for notification of SAE information. In rare 
circumstances and in the absence of e- mail capacity, notification by [CONTACT_746917], with a copy of the SAE reporting form sent by [CONTACT_9338].  Initial notification 
via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete the SAE reporting 
form and eCRF pages within the time frames outlined.  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he or she must not wait to receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event. The form must be updated when additional information is received. Follow-up information received on a ll 
SAEs must be forwarded to the sponsor by [CONTACT_196484].  
7.8. Regulatory Reporting Requirements 
The investigator must promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the procedures detailed in Secti on 7.7, “Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the 
Sponsor.” The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation.  Prompt notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_888559].  
Investigator letters are prepared according to sponsor policy and are forwarded to the investigators as necessar y. An investigator letter is prepared for any SAR that is attributable 
to study medication, serious, and unexpected. The purpose of the investigator letter is to fulfill specific regulatory and GCP requirements regarding the product under investigation. 
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with 
requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC. 
7.9. Precautions  
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be discontinued immediately but 
should be followed through delivery or termination of the pregnancy. A subject  should also 
notify the investigator if she becomes pregnant within [ADDRESS_1243604] be notified of all pregnancies reported to the investig ator (see

8.3. General Considerations for Statistical Analysis 
8.3.1. Software and General Statistical Methods  
Data processing, tabulation of descriptive statistics, calculation of inferential statistics, and graphical representations will be performed primarily using SAS (release 9. 4 or higher) for 
Windows. If the use of other software is warranted, the final statistical methodology report will detail what software was u sed for what purposes. 
For continuous variables, summary statistics including number of subjects with data, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum will be provided. For categorical variables, the number of subjects and percentage for e ach category will be presented.  
8.3.2. Analysis Datasets  
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: The ITT set will include all subjects who are assigned 
randomly to receive study medication. 
Efficacy Set: The efficacy analysis set will include all subjects who are assigned random ly to 
receive study medication and who have recorded at least one PI [INVESTIGATOR_888528] . This analysis set is identified  as the modified Intend- to-Treat (mITT) set.  
Safety Set: The safety set will include all treated subjects and will be used for safety and 
tolerability assessments.  
8.3.3. Test Hypothesis and P Value Justification 
This is a study designed to look at differences between the pairs of treatments or pooled 
treatments and linear combinations of the treatments  or pooled treatments . The null 
hypothesis for each comparison made in this study is that there is no difference between the

Heron Therapeutics  Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS]. General Considerations  
The ethical standards defined within GCP are intended to ensure the following: 
• Human subjects are provided with an adequate understanding of the possible risks of 
their participation in the study, and they have a free choice to participate or not. 
• The study is conducted with diligence and in conformance with the protocol in such a 
way as to ensure the integrity of the findings. 
• The potential benefits of the research justify the risks. 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. is the sponsor of study HTX -011-C2016-208. The sponsor (or its 
designee) is responsible for all of the following: 
• selecting qualified investigators  
• providing investigators with the information they need to conduct the investigation 
properly 
• ensuring proper monitoring of the investigation 
• ensuring that appropriate regulatory agencies and all participating investigators are properly informed of significant new information regarding AEs or risks associated 
with HTX-011, HTX-002, or HTX-002. 
9.1.3. Informed Consent  
The sponsor (or its designee) will provide investigators with a multicenter informed consent 
form for this study.  Investigators may adapt the information to suit the needs of their 
institution, if necessary (although it must reflect the required elements of informed consent specified in 21 CFR Part 50.25). The final informed consent form must be accepted by [CONTACT_196491]. Investigators must provide the sponsor with an unsigned copy of the final informed consent form before and after it is approved by [CONTACT_4186].  If any new information becomes available that might affect subject s’ willingness to 
participate in the study,  or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to the informed 
consent form, the sponsor will provide investigators with a revised informed consent form. The IRB or IEC must provide written approval of any revisions to the informed consent form in advance of its use.  
Investigators must provide subject s with all the information necessary to make an informed 
decision about their participation in the study, including the nature and intended purpose of the study, possible benefits, and possible risks. 
All information in the informed consent form should be provided in a language (whether 
written or spoken) that is as nontechnical as practical and that is understandable to the 
subject s. 
Before written informed consent is obtained, the subject  should be give n ample time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study. All questions must be answered to the satisfaction of the subject (or his or her legally authorized representative). 
Protocol No: HTX -011-C2016 -[ADDRESS_1243613] (or his or her legally authorized representative) and 
any other signatories as required by [CONTACT_4186].  
If a subject  (or legally authorized representative) cannot read, a short form approved by [CONTACT_888560]. Only the short form itself is to be signed by [CONTACT_47767].  However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the 
summary, and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign the copy of the summary in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27 (b2). 
After all required signatures have been obtained, a copy of the informed consent form should 
be provided to the subject, and the original must be kept on file at the site and made available for review by [CONTACT_456]. Documentation of the informed consent discussion must be noted 
in the subject’s case history.  
9.1.4. Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The investigator is responsible for completing and maintaining adequate and accurate eCRFs and source document ation.  Source documentation constitutes original records (first point of 
entry, either hard copy or electronic), which may include progress notes, medication administration records, operation reports, laboratory reports, discharge summaries, and so on. 
9.2. Study Monitoring 
The sponsor (or its designee) is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study with 
regard to subject protection, ethics, protocol adherence, site procedures, and integrity of the 
data.  At regular intervals during the study, the sponsor’s study monitors will contact [CONTACT_888561], telephone calls, and letters in order to review study progress and eCRF completion and to address any concerns or questions regarding the study conduct. During monitoring visits, th e following aspects of study conduct will be carefully reviewed: 
subjects’ informed consent documents, subject  recruitment procedures, subjects’ compliance 
with the study procedures, source-data verification, drug accountability, use of concomitant therapy  by [CONTACT_1766], AE and SAE documentation and reporting, and quality of data. 
9.3. Quality Assurance 
The sponsor, a regulatory authority, or an IRB representative may visit the study site at any time during the study or after completion of the study to perform audits or inspections. The purpose of a sponsor audit or regulatory inspection is to examine systematically and independently all study related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted according to the protocol, GCP, ICH guidelines, and any other applicable regulatory requirements. Investigators should contact [CONTACT_167449] a regulatory agency about an inspection at their site. 
9.4. Study and Site Closure  
If the sponsor, investigator, or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions arising 
during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the study site should be 
Protocol No: HTX -011-C2016 -208 Page 65 of 81 
Version 7  
 
 
Heron Therapeutics  Confidential  closed, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the sponsor and 
investigator.  Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
• discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subject s enrolled in 
the study 
• submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the sponsor, 
study monitor, or regulatory agencies 
• failure of the investigator to comply with GCP ( eg, ICH guidelines, regulatory agency 
guidelines) 
• insufficient adherence to protocol requirements or an unacceptably high rate of 
missing, erroneous, or improperly collected data 
• evidence from the blinded data of sufficient technical problems with the study that 
one could believe with a high degree of certainty that subject s are being exposed to 
the investigational drug without a realistic expectation of ev aluable data  
• a decision on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing evaluation or development of the product 
• failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate  
9.5. Records Retention

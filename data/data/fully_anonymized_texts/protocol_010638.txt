Amendment 4: 1 6 Mar 2023  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.   
Overall Rationale for the Amendment  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to reduce the sample size and consequently remove 
the interim analysis. Other updates have been incorporated based on Investigators, the 
independent data monitoring committee (IDMC ) and regulatory feedback, to provide further 
clarity on the protocol or to correct er rors. The table below does not include correction of minor 
typographical errors and formatting/stylistic changes.  
 
Section # and Name  [CONTACT_671496].  Updated to provide further 
clarity.  
1.1 Synopsis, Overall 
design  
4.1 Overall design  IDMC review information was

1.1 Synopsis  
Protocol title  
A multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of dapi[INVESTIGATOR_671326]  
A randomized placebo -controlled study to eva luate the efficacy and safety of dapi[INVESTIGATOR_671327] (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease which can 
present with a ch ronic disease course but has more often a relapsing -remitting disease course. 
The majority of patients develop tissue and organ damage over time with current standard of care 
(SOC) medication due to either lack of well -controlled disease activity or due to  toxicities of the 
SOC medications. Therefore, new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_671328] -term control of the 
disease activity of SLE with well -tolerated SLE medication. The study aims to evaluate the 
efficacy of dapi[INVESTIGATOR_271322] ( DZP) in study participan ts who have persistent active or 
frequently relapsing -remitting SLE with moderate to severe disease activity despi[INVESTIGATOR_671329] -biological SOC medication and therefore have an unmet medical need for a treatment 
intervention with new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Overall design  
The study will be conducted to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of DZP in study 
participants with active SLE despi[INVESTIGATOR_671330].  
This study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group, Phase 3 study in 
study participants 16 years of age and older with moderately to severely active SLE who are 
receiving stable SOC medication (ie, antimalarials, corticosteroids, and/or  immunosuppressants) 
in line with local and international guidances at Screening Visit (V1). It will primarily 
investigate the improvement of SLE disease activity in study participants treated with DZP as 
add-on to nonbiological SOC treatment over 48  weeks. Key secondary objectives will be to 
investigate early improvement at Weeks 12 and 24, long -term disease control as evidenced by 
[CONTACT_671375] 2004 
(BILAG) flares (severe BILAG flare -free) through Week 48, achievement of a treat -to-target 
endpoint (low disease activity state in conjunction with low/acceptable corticosteroid dose [low 
lupus disease activity state LLDAS]) through Week  48, and long -term improvement of disease 
activity as  assessed with an instrument commonly used in clinical practice (Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 [SLEDAI -2K]) at Week 48.  
The study consists of a 2 -week Screening Period, 48 -week Treatment Period, and 6 -week Safety 
Follow -up (SFU) Period. Due to the required moderate to severe disease activity at screening 
visit (V1), a short Screening Period is planned. At the start of the study, eligible study 
participants will be randomized (2:1) to DZP  24mg/kg or to placebo administered by [CONTACT_671376] 
(iv) infusion every 4 weeks (Q4W). The initial dose will be administered as a 2 -hour infusion 
while each subsequent dose will be administered as a 1 -hour infusion. Study participants who 
complete the 48 -week Treatment Period may be eligible to parti cipate in the open -label 
extension (OLE) study (SL0046). Study participants who withdraw early from the [ADDRESS_907026] 10 weeks after

Confidential  Page 20 of 185 their final dose of study medication (also refer red to as investigational medicinal product [IMP] 
in the document).  
Eligible study participants will have persisting active or relapsing -remitting SLE at screening 
visit (V1) despi[INVESTIGATOR_671331] (ie, antimalarials, corticosteroids, and/or 
immunosu ppressants), in line with local and international guidance at screening visit (V1). Study 
participants considered to have a monophasic or an infrequent relapsing -remitting disease course 
(defined as no evidence for frequently flaring disease course and low  risk to have frequent flares) 
will be excluded as their disease likely does not correspond to a persistent active or frequently 
relapsing SLE despi[INVESTIGATOR_671332] . 
During the study, participants with a corticosteroid dose above a long -term tolerable leve l 
(7.5mg/day prednisone equivalent) will have to start corticosteroid tapering no later than the 
Week 8 Visit (Visit 4) to reach a target of 7.5mg/day or below. Investigators will be encouraged 
to start steroid tapering earlier if the condition of the stud y participant suggests improvement. 
Guidance will be provided on how to taper but the exact tapering regimen will be at the 
discretion of the Investigator to be adapted to the individual study participant’s disease activity. 
Other SLE SOC treatment will ha ve to be kept stable unless a reduction is indicated due to side 
effects. In case of insufficient improvement of disease activity, or a clinically relevant worsening 
of the disease activity, Investigators may initiate an escape treatment ( Section  6.6.2 ) by 
[CONTACT_671377]. Depending on the nature of an escape 
treatment intervention, DZP may have to be discontinued if there is a safety concern. 
Investigators should discuss the impact of escape treatment use on study cond uct with the 
Medical Monitor before initiation. In case of an initiation of escape treatment, study participants 
may be declared as nonresponders  for the primary endpoint; however, they do not have to be 
withdrawn from the study.  
Study participants will be  encouraged to stay in the study under observation even if the study 
medication is discontinued (see Section  7.1). A study participant will have to be withdrawn from 
the study only if the study participant withdraws consent or a regulator, Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC), or the independent data monitoring committee 
(IDMC) requests a withdrawal for justified reasons (see  Section  7.2). 
An IDMC will be established to monitor the benefit -risk profile of study participants during the 
study. The IDMC will regularly review d ata and will have access to unblinded data as needed. 
The review will include observations in the BILAG 2004 neuropsychiatric body organ system in 
order to monitor potential neuropsychiatric events  falsely assigned to SLE. Details are described 
in the IDMC  charter. The IDMC will provide recommendation if the study should be stopped, 
should be adapted or can proceed as planned.  
Number of participants  
Approximately 700 participants will be screened at approximately 230 sites in approximately 
31 countries to a chieve approximately 312 participants randomly assigned (2:1) to DZP 24mg/kg 
or to placebo for an estimated total of 208 and 104 participants in the DZP 24mg/kg and placebo 
groups, respectively.

2.1 Study rationale  
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease which can 
present with a chronic disease course but has more often a relapsing -remitting disease course. 
The majority of patients deve lop tissue and organ damage over time with current SOC 
medication due to either lack of well  controlled disease activity or due to toxicities of the SOC 
medications. Therefore, new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_671328] -term control of the disease 
activity o f SLE with well  tolerated SLE medication. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of 
DZP in study participants who have persistent active or frequently relapsing -remitting SLE with 
moderate to severe disease activity despi[INVESTIGATOR_671334] -biological SOC medication and 
therefore have an unmet medical need for a treatment intervention with new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

The totality of t he evidence from studies with clinical and immunological outcome parameters 
suggests a signal of superior efficacy of DZP in combination with SOC as compared with SOC 
alone in patients with persisting active or frequent relapsing -remitting SLE.  
Risks from taking part in the studies will be minimized through the selection of an appropriate 
dose level, selection of appropriate study participants defined by [CONTACT_26141]/exclusion criteria, 
an independent data monitoring committ ee (IDMC), regular safety monitoring, and regular 
blinded assessments of study data assessments.  
Overall, the benefit -risk profile of DZP is considered favorable for further clinical development 
in a Phase 3 program. Further information can be found in the  Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

corticosteroid dose [LLDAS]) through Week  48, and long -term improvement of disease activity 
as assessed with an instrument commonly used in clinical practice (SLEDAI -2K) at Week 48.  
The study consists of a 2 -week Screening Period, 4 8-week Treatment Period, and 6 -week SFU 
Period (if the participant completes the study but decides not to enter the open -label extension 
study SL0046). Due to the required moderate to severe disease activity at screening visit (V1) 
and limited allowed trea tment possibilities during the screening phase, a short Screening Period 
is planned. At the start of the study, eligible study participants will be randomized (2:1) to 
DZP  24mg/kg or to placebo administered by [CONTACT_313582] Q4W. The initial dose will be 
admi nistered as a 2 -hour infusion while each subsequent dose will be administered as a 1 -hour 
infusion. Study participants who complete the 48 -week Treatment Period may be eligible to 
participate in the OLE study (SL0046). Study participants who withdraw early  from the [ADDRESS_907035] persisting active or relapsing -remitting SLE at screening 
visit (V1) despi[INVESTIGATOR_671331] (ie, antimalarials, corticosteroids, and/or 
immunosuppressants), in line with local and international guidance at screening visit (V1). Study 
participants considered to have a monophasic or an infrequent relapsing -remitt ing disease course 
(defined as no evidence for frequently flaring disease course and low risk to have frequent flares) 
will be excluded as their disease likely does not correspond to a persistent active or frequently 
relapsing SLE despi[INVESTIGATOR_671335]. 
During the study, participants with a corticosteroid dose above a long -term tolerable level 
(7.5mg/day prednisone equivalent) will have to start corticosteroid tapering no later than the 
Week 8 Visit (Visit 4) to reach a target of 7.5mg/day or below. Investi gators will be encouraged 
to start steroid tapering earlier if the condition of the study participant suggests improvement. 
Guidance will be provided on how to taper but the exact tapering regimen will be at the 
discretion of the Investigator to be adapted  to the individual study participant’s disease activity. 
Other SLE SOC treatment will have to be kept stable unless a reduction is indicated due to side 
effects. In case of insufficient improvement of disease activity, or a clinically relevant worsening 
of the disease activity, Investigators may initiate an escape treatment ( Section  6.6.2 ) by 
[CONTACT_671377]. Depending on the nature of an escape 
treatment intervention, DZP may have to be discontinued if there is a safety concern. 
Investigators should discuss the impact of escape treatment use on study cond uct with the 
Medical Monitor before initiation. In case of an initiation of escape treatment, study participants 
may be declared as nonresponders  for the primary endpoint; however, they do not have to be 
withdrawn from the study.  
Study participants will be  encouraged to stay in the study under observation even if the study 
medication is discontinued (see Section  7.1). A study participant will have to be withdrawn from 
the study only if the study participant withdraws consent or a regulator, Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC), or the independent data monitoring committee 
(IDMC) requests a withdrawal for justified reasons (see  Section  7.2). 
An IDMC will be established to monitor the benefit -risk profile of study participants during the 
study. The IDMC will regularly review d ata and will have access to unblinded data as needed. 
The review will include observations in the BILAG 2004 neuropsychiatric body organ system in

4.2 Scientific rationale for study design  
A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study design has been selected to 
demonstrate efficacy and safety of DZP to support regulatory filing. The study population will 
include study participants 16 years of age and older with moderately to severely active SLE who 
are receiving stable SOC medication (ie, antimalarials, cortic osteroids, and/or 
immunosuppressants) at screening visit (V1). The primary efficacy outcome measures and other 
efficacy assessments included in this study are consistent with those used for some other SLE 
studies and are considered appropriate for establis hing efficacy of DZP. Clinically relevant 
improvement of moderate to severe disease activity over 48 weeks will be used to demonstrate 
the efficacy of DZP over placebo long term. Early clinically relevant improvement from 
moderate to severe disease activit y will be assessed after 12 and 24 weeks. Long -term disease 
control will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_671385] (flare -free), the achievement of 
the treat -to-target endpoint LLDAS, and the reduction in SLEDAI -2K score.  
4.[ADDRESS_907036] dose of 6mg/kg was selected based on 
non-clinical data on a non -human primate tetanus toxoid (TT) model showing mini mal reduction 
of  titers suggesting some immunomodulation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
. 
SL0023 Study participants who received 24mg/kg or 45mg/kg DZP sho wed overall similar 
clinical response rates across all clinical endpoints and majority of time points as well as similar 
reduction in , therefore the 45mg/kg dose is not considered to provide 
added benefit as compared to the 24mg/kg. T his was also applicable in subgroups of participants 
with higher disease activity and/or more severe disease. While similarities were seen between 
24mg/kg and 45mg/kg doses, response rates in study participants receiving 6mg/kg were 
inconsistent. Moreover,  generation of anti -drug antibodies was increased in study participants 
receiving 6mg/kg as compared to study participants receiving 24mg/kg or 45mg/kg. Therefore, 
6mg/kg is considered as a dose with inferior efficacy while 24mg/kg is considered as dose wi th 
maximum observed effect. As doses between 6mg/kg and 24mg/kg overlap pharmacokinetically 
with the 24mg/kg dose, a clear assignment of benefit/risk to dosages below 24mg/kg is difficult. 
Therefore, in view of the aforementioned information, 24mg/kg was s elected as a dose with a 
maximum effect and an acceptable safety prof ile.

Confidential  Page 50 of 185 5.4 Screen failures  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently randomly assigned to study  medication. A minimal set of screen failure 
information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries 
from regulatory aut horities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE).  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be 
rescreened once, in this case the study participant will be assigned a new number; information on 
the previous number must be recorded.  
Study participants who require prophylaxis for LTBI must be on treatment for at least [ADDRESS_907051] 4 weeks of prophylaxis treatment after consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
Study participants who initiated treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) during the Screening 
Period will be sc reening failures as TB treatment needs to be stable at least [ADDRESS_907052] repeat initial screening 
laboratory parameters (except the interferon -γ release assay [IGRA] TB test), all physical 
examinations, and questionnaires (after completing at least 4 weeks of treatment for LTBI) at the 
rescreening visit prior to randomization in the study and must continue the full course of TB 
prophylactic therapy.  
The Investigator must assess that  the study participant’s likelihood of completing the full course 
of TB prophylactic therapy is high and duly record their opi[INVESTIGATOR_658239]’s record 
prior to randomizing the study participant.

The IWRS will assign eligible participants to a treatment regimen based on a predetermined 
production randomization and/or packaging schedule provided by [CONTACT_18338] (or designee). The 
randomization schedule will be produced by [CONTACT_153889]. The IWRS will  generate 
individual assignments for participant kits of IMP, as appropriate, according to the visit schedule. 
Participants’ treatment assignment will be stratified by [CONTACT_671390] (North America vs 
Western Europe/Asia -Pacific vs Latin America/Eastern Eur ope), Screening disease activity

At Screening, each candidate participant will be assigned a 5 -digit number that serves as the 
participant identifier throughout the study. The participant number will be required in all 
communication between the Investigator or designee and th e IWRS regarding a particular 
participant.  
Eligible participants will be randomized to treatment groups at the Baseline Visit (Day 1). The 
IWRS will allocate kit numbers to the participant based on the participant number during the 
course of the study. Par ticipant numbers and kit numbers will be tracked via the IWRS.  
Study medication will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in Schedule of Activities 
(Section  1.3). 
To minimize bias, the same Investigator should perform the key efficacy assessments BILAG

Should other study with DZP be performed at the same site, all efforts will be made to maintain 
the blinding at the site level as defined in this protocol as long as the study will be performed.  
Under normal circumstances, the blinded treatment must not be revealed. It will be possible to 
break the blind, if medically indicated ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). The impact on study conduct of this 
should be discussed in advance with the Medical Monitor or the Spo nsor’s Study Physician 
whenever possible.

If a situation arises in which it is medically indicated to determine the treatment (ie,  knowledge 
of the nature and/or dose of the applied study medication de termines decisions on further 
diagnostic procedures or treatment), it will be possible to determine to which treatment arm the 
study participant has been allocated during the Double -Blind Treatment Period by [CONTACT_117191]. All sites will be provided with details of how to contact [CONTACT_671391]. Unblinding can be initiated by [CONTACT_671392]; however, whenever possible, the Medical Monitor or the Sponsor’s Study Physician 
shou ld be consulted prior to unblinding to discuss the impact on the study conduct.

these. All supplies and pharmacy documentation must be made available throug hout the study 
for the unblinded monitor to review.  
Study participants are expected to receive all doses of IMP as detailed in the schedule of 
assessments. Any study participants who deviate from the dosing schedule or miss any scheduled 
treatment should b e reported to the Medical Monitor as soon as possible for determination of 
possible schedule adjustments and continued eligibility; these study participants should return to 
their original visit schedule. These instances will be handled on a case -by-case b asis.

6.5.1  Permitted concomitant treatments (medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014])  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Corticosteroids  
Corticosteroids are permitted during the study at any dose in the sense of escape medication, if 
medically indicated (see Section  6.6.2 ). At the screening visit (V1) corticosteroid dose must not 
exceed 40mg/day prednisone equivalent and must be stable for 2 weeks prior to Screening 
(approximately 4 weeks prior to Baseline Visit). Further, the dose must remain stable during 
Screening Period and should be kept stable onwards, if possible, or tapered. In case of a high 
corticosteroid dose (>20mg/day) an early start of tapering should be considered depending on the 
individual patient’s condition. If the corticosteroid dose exceeds 7.5mg/day prednisone 
equivalent, it should be tapered in line with international treatment guidance as soon as possible, 
but must be initiated at the latest at W eek 8 (V4). The timepoint and speed of tapering should be 
adapted to the individual study participant’s condition (see below). Steroid doses should be 
converted to prednisone equivalent doses prior to the assessment of study participant inclusion 
criteria and initiation of corticosteroid tapering (regardless of route, except for intraocular, nasal, 
and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]). The list of corticosteroids and their corresponding prednisone equivalent doses can 
be found in Table  6-2.

To determine the prednisone equivalent dose of the corticosteroids shown on the left, multiply 
the mg dose of corticosteroid on the left by [CONTACT_671393]. For example, a 0.8mg dose of methylprednisolone is equivalent to 1mg (0.8mg ×  1.25) 
of prednisone.  
The dose of a specified corticosteroid that is equivalent to 1mg prednisone is given in Table  6-3.

A pulse dose (>500mg x 1 to 3 days) of iv corticosteroids should not have been given within the 
[ADDRESS_907059] 2 weeks prior to Screening (Visit  1). 
In study participants receiving concomitant corticosteroid doses >7.5mg/day prednisone or 
equivalent, a mandatory corticosteroid taper must be initiated as early as  possible but no later 
than [ADDRESS_907060] study medication infusion (Day 56). The tapering regimen will aim to 
reduce the daily prednisone equivalent dose to 7.5mg/day or lower by [CONTACT_10585] 18.  
If such a rapid tapering is not considered by [CONTACT_671394], a slower tapering regimen can be used.  
Study participants achieving a dose of 7.5mg/day or lower may remain on this dose or continue 
to taper at the discretion of the Investigator. It is recomme nded to reduce the dose further in a 
slow manner.  
Study participants whose disease is worsening after initiation of tapering and therefore cannot 
fulfill the taper based on the Investigator’s judgment or whose corticosteroid dose has to be 
increased, if in dicated, should remain in the study and receive corticosteroids at an appropriate

Vaccines  
Administration of live vaccines should not occur during the conduct of the study. If a study 
participant receives a live vaccine, temporary or permanent discontinuation of study medication 
may be needed. In case of considered application of live v accines the Medical Monitor and/or 
Sponsor’s Study Physician should be contact[CONTACT_671399].  
Administration of non -live vaccines is allowed during the study at the discretion of the 
Investigator and should be documented . Local and international guidance on vaccination in 
immunocompromised patients (Furer et al, 2020; Van Assen et al, 2011; Murdaca et al 2016;

According to local and international guid ance approved SARS -CoV -2 vaccines are endorsed to 
be used in patients receiving immunosuppressant treatment (ACR 2021; EULAR 2021).  
It cannot be excluded that the effectiveness of some vaccines may be compromised by [CONTACT_671400] . Therefore, blood 
samples will be collected to be able to determine the effect of DZP on the immune response to 
vaccines, eg,  as indicated.  
The potential benefits an d risks and vaccine administration options should be discussed with the 
study participant.  
In case of administration of investigational Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) vaccine 
(vaccines without regulatory authorization or emergency authorization) stud y medication should 
not be administered within [ADDRESS_907062] with the Medical Monitor before initiation.  
Initiation of escape treatment may be handled as  intercurrent event in estimands, which will be 
detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) as described in Section  9.3.1 . For the primary 
endpoin t, specification of how escape treatment will be handled as an intercurrent event is 
detailed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , Section  9.3.[ADDRESS_907063] to be automatically 
discontinued, however if the escape treatment in combination with DZP represents a safety 
concern (see Section  6.6) for the study participant the study medication should be discontinued 
but the study participant should remain in the study under observation. Investigators are advised 
to contact [CONTACT_671401], to discuss the potential impact on the further 
study conduct in case  study medications should be permanently discontinued.  
The following escape medications may be used as indicated:  
• Corticosteroids (new initiation or increase in dose)  
• Immunosuppressants (new initiation or increase in dose):  
− azathioprine  
− methotrexate

Section  8.2.7 ) and tuberculosis (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Caution should be taken to exclude a 
clinically significant infection in case of symptoms (see Section  8.3). Study participants must 
be closely followed up. In case of resolution of the event leading to interruption, study 
medication can be restarted after consultation with the Medical Moni tor unless the event 
fulfils the criteria for permanent study drug discontinuation. In case of upcoming surgery, the 
time between the last infusion of study medication administered to the participant and the 
surgery should be at least 4 weeks (if possible 6 weeks). After surgery, study medication can 
be restarted once the proliferative phase of wound healing is completed.  
2. If there is a positive pregnancy test, study medication will be held. If there is confirmed

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Sche dule of Activities ( Table  1-2). 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or the Sponsor Study 
Physician immediately upon occurrence or awarenes s to determine if the participant should 
continue or discontinue study treatment.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essential and required for study conduct.  
All screening evaluations mu st be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants 
meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening fail ure, as 
applicable.  
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count)  
and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes 
provided the procedures met the protocol -specified  criteria and were performed within the time 
frame defined in the Schedule of Activities.  
The amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study will be 
approximately 900mL. Additional extra assessments that may be required for re-screening, 
technical issues with the collected samples or safety evaluations may result in additional blood 
volume to be collected.

8.1.1  Clinical assessments of disease activity  
[IP_ADDRESS]  BILAG 2004  
The BILAG  2004 will be used as a clinical assessment of SLE disease activity 
(Tsokos  et al, 2007).  
The Investigators will perform an anamnesis and physical examination at every visit and will 
record present symptoms corresponding to the BILAG  2004 components in the electronic 
clinical outcomes ass essment (eCOA). Clinical features attributable to SLE are to be recorded 
and based on the study participant’s condition in the last [ADDRESS_907070] indicate whether o r not 
values are outside the normal range and, if outside the normal range, whether or not they are due 
to SLE.  
Nine body/organ -based systems will be assessed if SLE symptoms are present:  
• Constitutional (fatigue, fever, anorexia, weight loss, etc)  
• Mucocutaneous (rash, alopecia, mucosal ulcers, etc)  
• Neuropsychiatric (headache, seizure, psychosis, etc)  
• Musculoskeletal  etc) 
• Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (coronary vasculitis, cardiac failure, effusion, etc)  
• Gastrointestinal (lupus enteritis, h epatitis, peritonitis, etc)  
• Ophthalmic (keratitis, scleritis, optic neuritis, etc)  
• Renal (proteinuria, urine microscopy for red blood cells, casts, etc)  
• Hematology (cytopenias, coagulopathy, etc)  
The Investigator must maintain/provide independent supportin g source documents (eg, chart, 
worksheet, clinic notes, labs, and photodocumentation of cutaneous SLE manifestations) capable 
of withstanding audit:  
• For each SLE symptom present at the visit or present within the past 4 weeks before the visit  
• Indicating if  symptom had a new onset, was improving, same, or worse in the past 4 weeks as 
compared to the prior 4 weeks  
• Sufficient descriptive detail to support changes (improved, worsening); eg,  number/location 
of arthritic joints, size/location of rashes, etc  
• Infor mation indicating that other symptoms relevant for BILAG were not present at the time 
point of the visit and within the 4 weeks prior to the visit

met BILAG  2004 eligibility for randomization.  
The BILAG  2004 grading is anchored in the physician’s intention to treat. Disease activity is 
graded separately for 9 body systems to 5 different grades (A to E) as follows:  
A (“Active”)  = Severely active di sease (sufficient to require systemic immunosuppressant 
or anticoagulant therapy; eg, >20mg/day prednisone, immunosuppressants, 
or cytotoxics)  
B (“Beware”)  = Moderately active disease (requires low dose or local immunosuppressant 
therapy or symptomatic therapy; eg, prednisone ≤20mg/day prednisone, or 
antimalarials)  
C (“Contentment”)  = Mild stable disease (no indication for changes in treatment)  
D (“Discount”)  = Inactive now but previously active  
E (“Excluded”)  = Never affected  
An SLE Assessment Reference Guide will be provided to all study personnel, which contains 
detailed protocol -specific clarifications and extensions of BILAG  2004 clinical parameter 
definitions and guidance for correlating SLEDAI -2K and BILAG  2004 clinical parameters.

[IP_ADDRESS]  SLEDAI -2K 
The SLEDAI -2K (30  days) measures disease activity. Disease activity in the 30  days prior to and 
at the time point of the assessment shall be considered. It is a global index and includes 
24 clinical symptoms and laboratory variables that are weighted by [CONTACT_671403] n, but 
not by [CONTACT_671404]. The SLEDAI -2K includes scoring for 
antibodies  positive or negative) and low complement, as well as some renal and 
hematologic parameters. The total score falls between 0 and 105, with hi gher scores representing 
increased disease activity. The SLEDAI -2K has been shown to be a valid and reliable disease 
activity measure in multiple study participant groups (Gladman  et al, 2002).  
To confirm study participant eligibility at Baseline (Visit  2), the SLEDAI -2K score without any 
laboratory values is calculated based on all the clinical variables only, without factoring in the 
laboratory variables. At Screening (Visit  1), the SLEDAI -2K will include laboratory parameters.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  S2K RI -[ADDRESS_907074] 50% compared with 
the previous assessment; the S2K RI -50 reflects disease activity over the 30  days prior to the 
assessment (Touma  et al, 2011).  
The S2K RI -[ADDRESS_907075] resulted when a descriptor was 
present at the previous assessment:  
1. The descriptor has achieved complete remission, in which case the score would be “0”;  
2. The descriptor has not achieved a minimum of 50% improvement, in which case the score 
would be identical to its corresponding SLEDAI -2K value; or  
3. The descriptor has improved by ≥50% (according to the S2K RI -50 definition) but has not 
achieved complete remission, in which case the score was evaluated as one -half the score 
that would be assigned fo r SLEDAI -2K. 
If a descriptor was not present at the previous assessment, the value for the S2K RI -50 was the 
same as that for SLEDAI -2K. This process was repeated for each of the 24  descriptors.

Confidential  Page 74 of 185 [IP_ADDRESS]  Physician’s Global Assessment  
The Investigator will rate the overall status of the study participant in response to the following 
statement:  
“Please mark a vertical line on the scale below to assess the overall status of the study 
participant’s Systemic Lupus Erythematosus signs and symptoms and the functional capac ity 
of the study participant. The very far left end is ‘very good, asymptomatic and no limitation 
of normal activities’; the very far right end indicates ‘severe disease’. This refers to the most 
severe possible disease, and does not reflect the most sever e ever seen in a particular patient, 
but the most severe disease ever seen in all SLE patients.”  
When scoring the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA), the assessor should always look back 
at the score from the previous visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SELENA Flare Index (2009 revis ion) 
The SELENA (Safety of Estrogens in Lupus National Assessment) Flare Index in its 2009 
revision evaluates increases in SLE disease activity within eight organ systems: mucocutaneous, 
musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, hematological, constitutional, rena l, neurological, and 
gastrointestinal. The Investigator assesses different clinical manifestations within each organ 
system, treatment recommendations and the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The observed 
manifestations map into a flare categorization as no flare , mild flare, moderate flare, or severe 
flare. In case the assessment of a clinical manifestation and the recommendation for a treatment 
change are discrepant the treatment choice takes precedence in the direction of a higher flare 
definition. Treatment ch anges recommended because of intolerance, toxicity or safety do not 
count towards a flare definition.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index  
The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) consists of 
2 scores; the first summarizes the activity of the disease and the second is a measure of the 
damage done by [CONTACT_90050] ( Table  8‒1) (Albrecht  et al, 2005). Activity is scored on the basis of 
erythema, scale/hypertrophy of skin and mucous membranes, acute hair loss, and nonscarring 
alopecia. Damage is scored in terms of dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_231727], including scarring 
alopecia. Study participants are asked whe ther dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_671341] [ADDRESS_907076] affected lesion within that area for each

Every effort should be made to ensure each study participant is evaluated by [CONTACT_317626] (or qualified assessor) during all study visits.  
The total TJC and SJC are the sum of all individual respective tenderness and swelling grades. If 
there are missing observations in the TJC or SJC, then the remaining observations are assessed 
and weighted by [CONTACT_671406] 28. If a joint is 
not evaluable at Baseline, then that joint is set to missing throughout the study. If more than 50%

[IP_ADDRESS]  SLICC/ACR Damage Ind ex 
The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/ACR Damage Index (version 
1996) for SLE measures irreversible, accumulated organ damage from either the disease process 
or disease treatment, which has been present for at least 6  months, in  12 organ systems. It is an 
important predictor of long -term mortality and is an independent outcome measure separate from 
the BILAG  2004 and SLEDAI -2K. Only nonreversible change that has occurred since the onset 
of SLE is to be included, rather than chang e related to active inflammation. Consequently, a 
damage/feature once documented cannot disappear. Otherwise, the original grading must be 
reassessed.  
Definition of damage:

• Occurring since onset of lupus  
• Not related to active inflammation  
• Present for at least 6  months  
• Ascertained by [CONTACT_13113]/x -rays

Study participants will complete 9 patient -reported outcomes (PROs) as per time points 
mentioned in the schedule of study assessments in Section  1.3. 
Study personnel other than the treating physician should administer the PROs. The PROs should 
be completed by [CONTACT_671407] a quiet place.  
The PROs should be completed in the following order: FATIGUE -PRO, Functional Assessment 
of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT -F), PGI -S Fatigue, PGI -C Fatigue, PGI -S, PGI -C, Lupus 
quality of life (QoL), Euro Quality of life 5 -Dimensions 5 -Level  (EQ-5D-5L), and PHQ -9. 
The PROs should only be checked for completeness. If a PRO  is incomplete, the study personnel 
may check with the participant that any missing data is involuntary. On dosing days, the PROs 
will be completed prior to dosing.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  FATIGUE -PRO  
The FATIGUE -SLE (Short Form) was renamed recently to FATIGUE -PRO. It consists o f 
31 items across 3 scales: Physical Fatigue (items 1 -9), Mental Fatigue (items 10 -20), and 
Fatigability (items 21 -31). The study participant is asked to score each fatigue item based on how 
frequently they experienced the item during the past 7◦days using  the following response 
options: 1=none of the time; 2=a little of the time; 3=some of the time; 4=most of the time; 5=all 
of the time. For each scale, a score ranging from 0 to 100 is calculated, with 100 indicating a 
higher level of fatigue.

Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue Scale is a 13 -item, self -reported tool 
that measures an individual’s level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past 
week (Cella, 2002). The level of fatigue is measured on a four -point Likert scale (4=not at all 
fatigued to 0 = very much fatigued). Clinically important difference (CID) estimates of 3.0 points 
were determined using anchor -based and distribution -based methods in three patient samples 
(affected by [CONTACT_67380]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PGI 
Patient Gl obal Impression of Severity (PGI -S) is a single -state, self -report measure that rates a 
participant's severity of their symptoms over the past week. The PGI -S is a 5 -point scale (“none”, 
“mild”, “moderate”, “severe”, “very severe”).  
Patient Global Impressi on of Fatigue Severity (PGI -S Fatigue) is a single -state, self -report 
measure that rates a participant's severity of their fatigue over the past week. The PGI -S is a 
5-point scale (“none”, “mild”, “moderate”, “severe”, “very severe”).  
Patient Global Impres sion of Change (PGI -C) is a single -state, self -report measure that reflects a 
participant's belief about the efficacy of treatment. The PGI -C is a 7 -point scale (“much 
improved”, “moderately improved”, “a little bit improved”, “no change”, “a little bit wo rse”, 
“moderately worse”, “much worse”).  
Patient Global Impression of Change in Fatigue (PGI -C Fatigue) is a single -state, self -report 
measure that reflects a participant's belief about the efficacy of treatment on their experience of

physical health (8  items), pain (3  items), planning (3  items), intimate relationships (2  items), 
burden to others (3  items), emotional health (6  items), body image (5  items), and fatigue 
(4 items). Scores are calculated independently for each domain and transformed to a 0 to 
100 point scale with higher scores denoting better HRQoL. A recent study has suggested 
minimal clinically important difference  scores for minimally  improved (ranging from 1.1 to 
9.2 points) and minimally worse (ranging from -0.5 to -6.4 points) for each of the 8  domains of 
LupusQoL (Devilliers  et al, 2015).

assessment instruments, such as the BILAG  2004 or the SLEDAI -2K and will be performed at 
every visit.  
Physical examination findings will be recorded in the eCRF at Screening. Clinically relevant 
changes in subsequent physical examinations will be recorded as AEs if not related to SLE. If 
physical examination findings are considered to be related to SLE, they will be documented 
within the BILAG  2004 and/or SLEDAI -2K assessment eCOA. The outcome of physical 
examinations and the interim medical history must be documented in source documentation.  
A complete physical examin ation will include, at a minimum, general appearance; ear, nose, 
mouth, and throat; eyes, hair, and skin; and assessments of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, hepatic, and neurological (including focused assessment of 
reflexes, sensitivity, and muscle strength) systems and mental status. Height (only at Screening) 
and weight (at applicable visits and if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737]) will also be

8.2.6  Assessment and management of TB and TB risk factors  
Appropriate rigorous precautions are being taken within this protocol to monitor the risk of TB 
infection i n this study (s ee Section  5.2 [Exclusion Criterion 19] and  Section  7.1 [discontinuation 
of study medication]). Any presumptive diagnosis or diagnosis of a TB infection is a reportable 
event. Confirmed active TB must be reported as an SAE ( Section  8.3). The Investigator is to 
complete and submit the TB follow -up form provided.  
For the purposes of this study, TB definitions are as follows:  
a. Known TB infection  
− Active TB infection or clinical signs and symptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_58917] (pulmonary or 
extra -pulmonary).  
− History of active TB infection involving any organ system or findings in other organ 
systems consistent with TB infection, unless adequately treated and proven to be fully 
recovered upon consul t with a TB specialist.  
− Any evidence by [CONTACT_671411]’s medical history.  
b. High risk of acquiring TB infection:  
− Known close exposure to another person with active TB infection within the 3 months 
prior to Screening.  
− Time spent in a healthcare delivery setting or institution where individuals infected with 
TB are housed and where the risk of transmission of infection is high.  
c. Latent TB infe ction (unless appropriate prophylaxis is initiated at least 4 weeks prior to study 
medication dosing and continued to completion of prophylaxis):  
− The absence of signs, symptoms, or physical findings suggestive of TB infection with a 
positive IGRA test (or [ADDRESS_907084] results) and a chest x -ray (or other 
imaging) without evidence of TB infection. If the result of the IGRA test is

immediately stop study medication administration. In case of an IGRA test conversion, the study 
participant must be considered as having either a suspected new latent or an active TB infection 
and be promptly referred to an appropriate specialist ( eg, pulmonologist, infectious disease 
specialist) for further evaluation. Additional assessments (eg, blood tests or IGRA, chest X -rays, 
or other imaging) should be performed where medically relevant and documented. Such 
conversions should be reported as A Es as described in the protocol. The AE term would need to 
be updated with final diagnosis once available.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_907088] discontinue further intake

may require therapy for TB. A study participant who answers “Yes” to the question “Has the 
study participant been in close contact [CONTACT_671413] T B, or an individual who 
has recently been treated for TB?” at Screening is excluded. A “Yes” response to any of the other 
questions within the questionnaire at Screening should trigger further careful assessment to 
determine if study participant has LTB or  active TB. A “Yes” response to any of the questions 
during the study should trigger further assessments to determine if the study participant has 
either LTB or active TB infection.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  TB management  
During the study, study participants who develop evidence of  LTBI, active TB or NTM infection 
must immediately stop further administration of study medication and will be referred to TB 
specialist (pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist) for further evaluation. Study 
participants diagnosed with active TB or  LTBI should receive appropriate TB or prophylaxis

diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, significant cardiac or pulmonal disease 
and concurrent treatment with a high dose corticosteroid (≥ 10mg/day prednisone equivalent) 
(Haberman et a l 2020, Fernandez et al 2020, Gianfrancesco et al 2020, Pablos et al 2020, Fredi et

Study drug application can be resumed ≥ 7 days after recovery of symptoms or, in case of an 
asymptomatic course, ≥ [ADDRESS_907095] result.  
In case of a known exposure to a person with CO VID-19 study drug administration should be 
suspended until ≥ [ADDRESS_907096].  
Study drug should be only resumed after consultation with the Medical Monitor (see 
Section  7.1.3 ). 
In case of a positive test result Investigators are advised to recommend quarantine measures to 
the study participants and report the infection according to the local guidance.  
Investigators are strongly advised to discuss with participants the potential risks associated with 
COVID -[ADDRESS_907097] – this includes wearing 
of masks in public, following social distancing best practice s and early medical consultation in 
case of symptoms of an infection, and reporting such symptoms to the Investigator.  
Local and international guidance on vaccination of immunocompromised patients (Furer et al,

as well as the option of being vaccinated during the study (including the screening period) should 
be discussed with the study participant during the informed consent process. In case a patient is 
deciding to be vaccinated during the screening period, the screening period may be prolonged to 
3 weeks (ie,  prolonged by 1 extra week).  
8.3 AEs and SAEs  
Adverse events will be rep orted by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).  
The study participant will be given the opportunity to report AEs spontaneously. A general 
prompt will also be given at each  study visit to detect AEs. For example:  
“Did you notice anything unusual about your health (since your last visit)?”  
In addition, the Investigator should review any self -assessment procedures (eg,  diary cards) 
employed in the study for potential AEs.  
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs 
that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or study proced ures, or that caused the 
participant to discontinue the  study treatment  (see Section  7). 
New or worsening manifestations of SLE should be recorded as AEs only if they are assessed as 
serious.  
All efforts should be taken to clarify the origin of the AE. This may require at any t ime point 
additional assessments including but not limited to additional laboratory assessments, imaging 
methods, EMGs and ECGs as medically indicated. Special caution should be taken on signs and 
symptoms of severe infections such as COVID -19. 
For results  disclosure on public registries (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov), TEAEs and treatment -
emergent SAEs will be published.  
8.3.1  Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the follow -up visit at the 
time points specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3). 
In order to ensure complete safety data collection, all AEs occurring during the study (ie,  after 
the signing of the ICF), including any pretreatment and posttreatment periods required by [CONTACT_12695], must be reported in the eCRF even if no study medication was taken but specific study 
procedures were conducted. T his includes all AEs not present prior to the initial visit and all AEs 
that recurred or worsened after the initial visit.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee within [ADDRESS_907098] and report to UCB (or its representative) any 
SAEs (even if the Investigator is certain that they are in no way associated with the study 
medication), up to from the end of the study for each participant, and to also inform participants 
of the need to inform the Investi gator of any SAE within this period. Serious AEs that the

application and any extensions or variations thereof.
UCB   [ADDRESS_907099] be reported to UCB 
regardless of the time between the event and the end of the study.  
The method of recording, evaluating, and as sessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in  Section  10.3. 
8.3.2  Method of detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.3.3  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
of special interest and non -serious AEs of special monitoring (as defined in  Section  8.3.6  and 
Section  8.3.7 , respectively ), will be followed  until resolution, stabilization, the Investigator 
determines that it is no longer clinically significant, the event is otherwise explained, or the 
participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). Further information on follow -up 
procedures is given in  Section  10.3. 
8.3.4  Regulatory reporting r equirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_46352] a SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
treatment under clinical investigation are  met. 
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements rel ating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, the IRB/IEC , and Investigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and  forwarded to 
Investigators as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_907100] be discontinued as soon as a pregnancy is suspected (eg, by [CONTACT_671414]). Study participants can remain in the study under observation and should atte nd 
to scheduled visits regularly as their condition allows. Blood sample collection will be adapted as 
indicated considering the study participant's condition during the study and at the end of the 
study visit. Caution is required with respect to concomita nt medication if not contraindicated in

participants and percentages (to one decimal place) i n each category will be presented.  
All descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_671417], including columns for 
all treated participants and all participants on demographics, baseline characteristics, and AE 
displays, and using the ava ilable data for the study population as observed. Summaries of 
concentration data will be based on geometric mean and geometric standard deviation instead of 
arithmetic versions. All tabulations will be sorted by [CONTACT_3148], parameter and visit (including 
time relative to dosing if applicable, unless otherwise stated). Only scheduled visits and times 
relative to dosing will be included in the tabulation.  
Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_3232], including columns for all 
treated study  participants and all study participants on demographics, baseline characteristics, 
and AE displays, using the number and percent of study participants in each category. 
Percentages will be based on the corresponding population size (ie, the denominator of  
percentages should match the sample size in the column header), unless otherwise noted via 
footnote in the applicable summary table.  
Statistical tests of efficacy variables will be presented as [ADDRESS_907110] s. P-values less than 0.0001 will be presented as “<0.0001” and 
p-values greater than 0.9999 will be presented as “>0.9999.”  
Handling of multiplicity for the primary and key secondary efficacy variables is discussed in 
Section  9.4. All other efficacy variables will be considered secondary or exploratory and will be 
assessed at a nominal 2 -sided α=0.05  significance level.  
9.2.2  Analysis time points  
The timeframe for this protocol compasses the entire study, which extends from Screening to 
10 weeks after the final dose, ie, 48 weeks of Double -Blind Treatment Period and 6 weeks of 
SFU Period.  
The following study periods will be includ ed in the analysis:  
• Screening Period: up to 14 days (Day -14 through Day -1). 
• Double -Blind Treatment Period: 48 weeks, starts with the randomization (1:2) of eligible 
participants to 1 of 2 treatment arms (SOC+PBO or SOC+DZP 24mg/kg), stratified in 
accorda nce with the 3 stratification factors. Study medication will be administered by [CONTACT_671418] 4 weeks, starting on Day 1.  
• Safety Follow -up Period: 6 weeks, participants who complete the 48 -week Double -Blind 
Treatment Period will continue into this 6 -week SFU Period. During this period, participants 
will not receive study medication but will be able to receive SOC treatment, as indicated.

For vital signs, a measurement prior to, or at the moment of, the start of the first infusion will be 
available for each visit. The last measurement prior to, or at the moment of, the start of the first 
infusion of study m edication will be used as the baseline value. An additional analysis will be

infusion to post -infusion for each infusion visit. At each post -Baseline Visit, the p re-infusion 
value will be one taken prior to, or at the moment of, the start of the infusion of study 
medication.  
For Baseline assessments, if the BILAG 2004 is completed, but the grade for 1 or more 
individual system(s) is missing, the grade for the system will be set to a grade of BILAG 2004 D 
if no value can be imputed from the Screening Visit. This is a conservative approach for study 
participants on active doses, since no improvement can occur following a baseline grade of

other formal comparisons will be performed.  
If it is significant at the α level, then proceed to perform key secondary endpoint comparisons as 
follows.  
Step 2: Perform the first key secondary efficacy endpoint comparison of BICLA respon der rate 
at Week 24 for SOC+DZP 24mg/kg versus SOC+PBO.  
If it is not significant at the α level, then stop the rest of the comparisons.

If it is significant at the α level, continue to:  
Step 4: Apply Hochberg Me thod for the next 2 key secondary endpoint comparisons in parallel 
(concurrently).  
If the larger p -value is ≤α, then both comparisons are statistically significant.  
Otherwise (ie, the larger p -value is > α), if the smaller p -value is ≤ α/2, then the corres ponding 
comparison is statistically significant.  
Otherwise (ie, the smaller p -value is > α/2), then neither comparison is statistically significant.  
Step 5:  Only if both of these 2 key secondary endpoint comparisons are significant (ie, the larger 
p-value is ≤ α), will proceed to the fifth key secondary endpoint BICLA responder rate at 
Week  12 and it will be tested at the α significance level.

9.6 Handli ng of dropouts or missing data  
As the primary efficacy variable is treatment responder rate in BICLA at Week 48, the handling 
of missing data, dropouts and intercurrent events is described as follows.  
• In case of the use of escape treatment as an intercurre nt event prior to the Week 48 Visit 
(ie, the escape treatment initiation is at least 1 day before), study participants will be included 
for the primary analysis as non -responders per the composite strategy handling of this 
intercurrent event.  
• Study partici pants who prematurely withdraw from the study or permanently discontinue 
study medication prior to the Week 48 Visit, will be included for the primary analysis as non -
responders per the composite strategy handling of this intercurrent event.  
• Study particip ants who have a missing BICLA response for the Week 48 assessment for any 
other reason besides defined intercurrent events will be imputed as non -responders for the 
primary efficacy analysis.

components, in order to obtain the BICLA response. If the Week 48 assessment was 
performed but the value for a single component (BILAG 2004, SLEDAI -2K, or PGA) is not 
available, then the missing component value will be imputed from the re spective previous 
visit value prior to computing the BICLA treatment response variable (limited to 1 visit 
back). In the case where the predose laboratory result is missing (at Screening and at 
Baseline and there is no other unscheduled predose laboratory result), the BILAG 2004 
body/organ system Baseline score for the body system requiring the missing laboratory result 
will be set to a score of BILAG [ADDRESS_907121] of patient safety, but the study cannot be stopped prematurely for overwhelmingly

participants in SOC+PBO and 208 stu dy participants in SOC+DZP 24mg/kg groups and an 
assumed SOC+PBO responder rate of 0.32, there will be 90% power to confirm an SOC+DZP 
24mg/kg responder rate of 0.52 (ie, a 0.20 improvement), corresponding to a [ADDRESS_907123] (SAS® v9.4 POWER procedure, Fisher’s exact). The sample size 
assumptions for SOC+PBO and SOC+DZP 24mg/kg responder rates are based on the Phase 2b 
study SL0023 responder data at Week 24.  
Participants who withdraw from the study prior to the Week 48 Visit will be i ncluded in the 
primary efficacy analysis as non -responders. Therefore, no additional participants are planned to 
be randomized in order to make up for early withdrawers.

Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study medication, whether or not considered related to the study 
medication.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of study medication.  
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test r esults (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) not related 
to SLE or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements not 
related to SLE, including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in  
the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, not related to progression of 
underlying disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition other than SLE including either 
an increase in frequency and/or intensity of t he condition.  
• New conditions not SLE related detected or diagnosed after study medication administration 
even though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study medication or 
a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an 
intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be 
reported regardless of sequelae.  
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be reported 
as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the 
signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as 
SAE if they fulfil the definition of a SAE.

If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under  study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the particip ant was at 
risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have 
caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually involving at least an 
overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9235]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_479381], 
the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline i s 
not considered an AE.  
d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medic al significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, , and accidental trauma 
(eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital a nomaly/birth defect  
f. Important medical events:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately

AE and SAE Recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related 
to the event.  
• The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical records 
to UCB in lieu of completion of the UCB/AE/SAE eCRF page.  
• There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_368744]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will 
be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_492845] s ubmission to UCB.  
• The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Asses sment of Intensity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study 
and assign it to 1 of the following categories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe 
should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an 
event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
• An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of  an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe (eg, a severe AE may be 
either serious or not serious, depending on whether these criteria are also met).  
The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) or the 
Rheumatology C ommon Terminology Criteria (RCTC) should be used as a supportive standardization 
instrument to evaluate AEs and SAEs but the final intensity grading by [CONTACT_671437], 
moderate, or severe.

Confidential  Page 119 of 185 Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study medication and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relation ship cannot be ruled out.  
• The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, 
as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study medication administration will be 
considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in 
his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/ she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to UCB. However, it is very important that the 
Inves tigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to UCB.  
• The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information and 
send a SAE follow -up report with the updat ed causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
 
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_368819]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional 
laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation  with other 
health care professionals.  
• An AE should be followed until it has resolved, has a stable sequelae, the Investigator 
determines that it is no longer clinically significant, or the participant is lost to follow up. This 
follow -up requirement appli es to AEs, SAEs, and AEs of special interest.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, 
the Investigator will provide UCB with a copy of any post -mortem findings including 
histopathology.  
• New or update d information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.  
• The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of 
the information.

Confidential  Page 120 of 185 Reporting of SAEs  
SAE Reporting to UCB via an Electronic Data Collection Tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to UCB will be the electronic data collection 
tool. 
• If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper 
SAE data collection tool (see next section).  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -
line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a 
previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then 
the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section ) or to the UCB 
Study Physician by [CONTACT_756].  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING.  
 
SAE Reporting to UCB via Paper CRF  
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the UCB Study Physician.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by [CONTACT_20021] a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by [CONTACT_13187].  
• Initial notification via  telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete and 
sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING.  
AEOIs and AESMs should be reported t o UCB within 24 hours irrespective of seriousness using 
the same procedures as reporting SAEs.

Definitions  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile foll owing menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP : 
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
− A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement the rapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 
12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
− Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of 
the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods  if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
Contraception Guidance  
Male participants  
Male participants with female partners of childbeari ng potential (including partners who are 
pregnant or breastfeeding [including pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_27451] a child]) must use 
contraception if any of the following criteria are met:  
• Genotoxic study medication  
• Study medication where reproductive toxicolog y studies have not yet been conducted  
• Study medication with demonstrated or suspected human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity at 
subtherapeutic exposure levels if relevant systemic concentrations may be achieved in 
WOCBP from exposure to seminal fluid

10.9.1  Poland  
The Polish Health Authority’s and Clinical Trial Facilitation Group have made recommendations 
related to contraception and pregnancy testing in a clinical study with IMP where the human data 
for exposure at pregnancy and nonclinical reproductive toxicology data are not available. As a 
mitigation measure, pregnancy testing is to be implemented monthly  up to [ADDRESS_907130] is added at 4 weeks after final study 
medication administration at Week 44 (Visit 13) for sites located in Poland, thus it meets the 
above requirement. Based on the short half -life of the study medication and because genotoxicity 
is not a class effect of the monoclonal antibody, it is considered  to reduce the duration of 
post-study medication administration requirement on contraception for female study participants 
of chil dbearing potential from 3 months to 2 months, with implementation of monthly pregnancy 
testing during this period.  
10.9.2  Romania  
The Romanian authorities introduced the following specific requirement for Romania: change in 
duration for the use of permitted oral corticosteroids (prednisolone) from a stable dose of 
2 weeks to 4 weeks prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 2). It is recommended for sites located in 
Romania, that oral corticosteroids (prednisolone) need to be stable for 4 weeks, rather than 
2 weeks as me ntioned in Section  5.1 of this protocol.

10.12  Appendix 12: Endpoint rationale  
Objectives  Endpoints  Rationale  
Primary  
To evaluate the ability 
of DZP as an add -on 
treatment to SOC 
medication to achieve 
clinically relevant 
long-term improvement 
of moderate to severe 
disease activity  Achievement of BICLA response at 
Week 48  BICLA is a composite endpoint which 
measures improveme nt of disease 
activity based on improvement by 
[CONTACT_35845] 2004 grades across all organ 
systems with relevant disease activity 
at screening visit (V1)/start of 
treatment. BILAG 2004 is developed 
and validated based on intention to 
treat principles. A change 
(imp rovement or worsening) by [CONTACT_12697] 1 grade represents a change in 
the need for and nature of a 
therapeutic intervention as determined 
by [CONTACT_671446] a clinically relevant change 
in disease activity. This can be either 
a clinically relevant improvement as 
demanded by [CONTACT_671447] a clinically 
relevant worsening (flare) as 
demanded to not occur by [CONTACT_671448]. As 
the BICLA demands improvement 
across all organ systems with disease 
activity suggesting the need for a 
therapeutic intervention, it r epresents 
clinically relevant improvement as to 
be demanded from a potent systemic 
immune response modifier. BICLA is 
inline with EMA regulatory guidance. 
BILAG as the driving component of 
the BICLA is in line with FDA 
regulatory guidance.  
Key Secondary  
To evaluate the ability 
of DZP as an add -on 
treatment to SOC 
medication to achieve 
fast, clinically relevant 
improvement of 
moderate to severe 
disease activity  Achievement of BICLA response at 
Week  [ADDRESS_907146] onset of 
response within 12 -24 weeks. This is 
relevant for study 
participants/prescribers to make 
informed treatment decisions as soon 
as possible including further change in 
therapy or further escalation of 
treatment.

To evaluate the abilit y 
of DZP as an add -on 
treatment to SOC 
medication to achieve 
long-term control of 
disease activity  Achievement of prevention of 
severe BILAG flares (severe 
BILAG flare -free) through Week 
[ADDRESS_907147] a substantial 
prevention of severe flares. Pr evention 
of disease flares is an intuitive 
measure if the disease is well 
controlled over time which is one of 
the primary objectives of treatment in 
SLE according to international 
treatment guidances. Severe flares are 
associated with poor long -term 
progn osis. 
To evaluate the ability 
of DZP as an add -on 
treatment to SOC 
medication to achieve 
and maintain the treat -
to-target goal: low 
disease activity with 
low/acceptable 
corticosteroid dose 
over time  Achievement of LLDAS in ≥50% 
of post -Baseline visits through 
Week [ADDRESS_907148] that more 
patients achieve and maintain over 
time the treat -to-target endpoint 
LLDAS. LLDAS represents low 
disease activity at a low/acceptable 
corticosteroid background medication 
dose level. It appears to be correlate d 
with long -term outcomes including 
damage prevention and flare 
prevention. It is therefore considered 
as highly clinically relevant. The 
LLDAS is based on achievement of a 
low SLEDAI -2K score which is a 
commonly used instrument to 
measure disease activity  state in 
clinical practice. As it combines the 
achievement of a steroid tapering 
target with the demand for a 
well-controlled disease, it represents 
clinically successful steroid sparing.  
International treatment guidances 
refer to LLDAS as treatment targ et.

of DZP as an add -on 
treatment to SOC 
medication to achieve 
improvement of 
disease activity as 
measured by [CONTACT_671449] -

To evaluate the ability 
of DZP as an add -on

endpoints  Achievement of prevention of

12 weeks before Screening. DZP is intended to provide a treatment 
option for study participants with residual

also stable SOC medication to judge 
adequately how well the study participants' 
disease is controlled and therefore to judge 
if there is a need for a treatment 
intervention at all which is the prerequisite 
to qualify for  an interventional study.  
 
In line with international and local 
treatment guidance documents and overall 
expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], antimalarials are accepted 
as the cornerstone of treatment in study 
participants with SLE accompanied with 
corticosteroids at the lowes t dose possible 
and/or immunosuppressants (if 
corticosteroids cannot be reduced to a 
well-tolerated level). However, some 
study participants do not tolerate 
corticosteroids and/or conventional

Screening, no change during  
Screening Period, and no iv pulse

Further a certain proportion of study 
participants do have to stop antimalarial 
treatment or are not intake adherent due to 
side effects. In rare cases antimalarials 
may also be not available to study 
participants. In this case study participants 
should still be on either corticosteroids or 
immunosuppressants or both.  
 
In terms of dosage for these treatments, 
changes in corticosteroid therapy can 
influence significantly and short term the 
disease activi ty in both direction - 
worsening and improvement of disease 
activity. Antimalarials and 
Immunosuppressants have a treatment 
effect with more latency, changes could 
interfere with the disease activity also 
longer after changes to the medication 
itself. The demand for stable corticosteroid 
therapy at least 2 weeks before screening 
visit (V1) and consequently approx. 4 
weeks before randomization (Baseline

antimalarial and immunosuppressant 
therapy longer term shall ensur e the

Participants could have these signs and

If signs and symptoms at screening visit

In fact, the s poradic flare can occur due to 
external events such as UV irradiation, 
infections, drug intake or in adherence to 
SOC treatment but may not represent an 
overall not controlled disease state.  
To avoid introducing a biological 
treatment in study participants  that may be 
controlled with SOC, an assessment is 
needed to ensure a well -documented 
medical history of multiple flares. In case 
no substantial documentation of the 
medical history is available (eg, in case of

In case of a suspected infusion reaction, samples should be taken as follows to determine serum 
tryptase levels to support the differential diagnosis (Muraro et al, 2022 ; Platzgummer et al, 
2020):  
• The first blood sample should be taken 30 minutes to 2 hours after the start of the 
reaction (if not feasible during  this time period, a sample may be taken up to 6 hours after 
the start of the reaction).  
• The second blood sample should be taken 24 or more  hours after complete resolution of 
symptoms. If obtaining the second blood sample on one of the following days after  the Type of reaction  Sponsor recommendations for management

Monitor vital signs every 5min until back to baseline  
Wait 20min  
If there is no indication of anaphylaxis (eg, generalized urticaria and/or 
bronchospasm), and if clinically appropriate, consider restarting the 
infusion at a lower rate fo llowing this suggested regimen:  
Restart infusion at 5mL/h for 15min

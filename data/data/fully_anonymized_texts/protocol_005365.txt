Page 2 of 7 1. GENERAL STATISTICAL PLAN  
The data analysis plan a priori  defines a primary intent -to-treat (ITT) population, a set of 
secondary evaluation populations, a primary  outcome measure,  a set of secondary outcome 
measures , a single primary evaluation time point, a secondary evaluation time point , a primary 
statistical  analysis methodology , a criteri on for statistical significance , and guidance for 
interpretation of results . 
The primary ITT population  is defined as all participants who complete a training set-up visit. 
Note that this includes all randomized participants  except those who drop/withdraw post -
randomization and pre -setup visit . 
The primary outcome measure , per determination of an independent external review committee 
comprised of experts in the diagnosis and evaluation  of the trial target population (i.e., 
individuals with hemispatial neglect following acquired brain injury) , is the Posner cueing task ; a 
spatial attention measure  that captures the visual Field Bias  score  (average reaction time to Left 
trials – average reaction time to Right trials ), as reporte d here:   
Rengachary, J., d'Avossa, G., Sapir, A., Shulman, G. L., & Corbetta, M. (2009). Is the 
posner reaction time test more accurate than clinical tests in detecting left neglect in acute 
and chronic stroke?.  Archives of physical medicine and rehabilita tion, 90(12), 2081 -
2088.  
To capture a valid assessment  of participants’ performance in the Posner cueing task (Field Bias  
score ) independent of criterion shifts or speed -accuracy trade -offs [Lange -Malecki and Treue, 
2012; Spence et al., 2001; Teufel  et al., 2010], w e will employ an inverse efficiency scoring 
approach  (IES; Townsend and Ashby, 1983 ) to account for potential differences in accuracy 
across Left and Right trial types (e.g., Val id and Invalidly cued trial s). Mean reaction times 
(RTs) will be divided by [CONTACT_291621].  
The secondary outcome measures  will evaluate training exercise -based progress , as well as  
performance in  several measures identified by [CONTACT_121982] , including:  spatial attention, spatial 
cognition, cognitive performance, functional ability, qualit y of life, and quality of sleep.

The primary analysis time point  is V2, the post -training assessment. The secondary analysis 
time point  is V3, the follow -up assessment.  
 
The primary statistical analysis  methodolo gy is a linear mixed -effects  model approach . We 
will first compare treatment and active control groups in the ITT population to determine if any 
differences in baseline demographic, characterization, outcomes variables, or total program use 
time remain after the randomization process . Any such factors that show trend level significant  
differences (p < 0.1)  will be noted and used as covariates in t he linear mixed model analysis. We 
will examine the data from each outcome measure using a linear mixed model with group and 
time as fixed f actors, site as a random factor , and co -variates as necessary from the baseline 
analysis . Missing data will be handled with an iterative maximum likelihood procedure to 
optimally estimate model parameters.  The key value for  significance will be the group -by-time 
interaction factor for the model.  This modeling will be conducted with a Type I error set at 0.[ADDRESS_355897] for effects in exercise -based progress as well as by 
[CONTACT_121982] (e.g., working memory, attention, processing speed) to determine the unique benefit in 
each area of attention, cognition and independent function. First, to determine if the treatment 
effect varies based on participants’ clinical severity of neglect ( Mesulam total misses ) or 
symptom subtype (e.g., sensory loss vs. intact sensory systems), we will correlate neglect 
severity (or subtype(s)) with gain scores on composite spatial cognition  or executive 
performance and composite functional performance (as well as individual assessment  measures). 
Additionally, we will measure whether improvements on certain components of the training 
program (e.g., improvements at inhibiting one’s response to target stimuli) are associated with 
composite attention, executive or functional performance sc ores (as well as individual 
assessment measures). This could indicate whether certain patterns of training improvements are 
related more to improvements in attention, executive or functional performance. These analyses 
will be evaluated after correcting fo r multiple comparisons (i.e., Bonferroni).  
The criterion for statistical significance  is p<0.05. Results greater than p = 0.05 and less than p 
= 0.11 will be described as trends.

Page [ADDRESS_355898] of the experimental software treatment  program  (incorporating TAPAT) 
on spatial  attention ) we will conduct the analysis based on the pre -training  (baseline) and post -
training data.   
 
Finding a significance level of p <  0.05 on the primary outcome measure will support the 
statement that the intervention  improves spatial attention  in the population . 
 
To evaluate the endurance of effects following completion of the experimental software 
treatment program  (incorporating TAPAT) we will use the same modeling approach  based on the 
pre-training assessment (baseline) and end of study (follow -up visit) assessment data using a 
mixed -effects model parallel to those used to meet the primary and secondary aims. Finding a 
significance level of p < 0.05 on the primary measure will support the hypothesis that the tr aining 
drives persistent improvement in spatial attention above and beyond an active control.  
 
To identify specific populations of treatment responders and non -responders) we will conduct 
exploratory data analyses post -hoc to examine predictors of treatmen t gain and predictors of lack 
of treatment gain based on baseline participant demographic, cognitive, and functional measures, 
as well as on learning rate and plateau performance measures derived over the course of the 
experimental software treatment progr am (incorporating TAPAT) use. We will initially employ 
single regression models to identify variables that predict change in cognitive and functional 
assessments, and then use generalized linear modeling to explore combinations of predictors of 
treatment g ain or lack of gain.

3. DATA NOT FROM CRFS   
The Optum™ SF -12v2 assessment is an online questionn aire used to measure  physical and 
mental health. Composite scores for these two measures are calculated by [CONTACT_8419], stored on 
Optum servers, and can be extracted as ne eded.  Data for the continuous performance task 
included in the EDC does not reflect all the raw data available for analysis. Raw data for this 
online assessment is captured and stored on Amazon  servers and can be extracted for analysis.

4. CALCULATION  OF DOMAIN COMPOSITE SCO RES  
The composite is composed of the individual measures described in section 1 (above), combined 
as follows:  
 
i. For each included variable  convert the distribution of raw scores in the ITT 
population at baseline to z-scores (with a mean of [ADDRESS_355899] deviation of 1 . 
Note that the raw score distribution may be non -normal (with skew or kurtosis) and 
the goal of this step is to transform that distribution into a normal distribution.  
ii. Calculate the composite score at V 1, V2, and V 3 for each participant based on the 
baseline data set . 
 
Five a priori  domain specific composites are defined as follows and constructed as above  
Spatial Cognition: Greyscales Task (raw scores), Spatial Working Memory Task (raw scores)  
 
Cognitive Performance: DKEFS Verbal Fluency (Letter Fluency, raw scores; Category Fluency  
total, raw scores; Category Switching total, raw scores;  Category Switching, switching Accuracy 
total, raw scores),  WAIS -IV Digit Span total (sum of forward, backward, sequencing raw 
scores) , WAIS -IV Digit Span (Forward total, raw scores; Backward total,  raw scores; 
Sequencing total, raw scores), Continuous Performance Task (raw scores)

 ANALYSIS  POPULATIONS   
There are four a priori  defined analysis populations , including a primary analysis population (i), 
three secondary analys is populations  designed to compare effect sizes : populations with no 
missing data (ii) , populations who completed all training visits (iii) , and populations that 
demonstrated a bias in spatial attentio n at baseline (i v). 
iii. Intent to Treat (ITT) population:  This is the a priori  primary analysis population, 
defined as including  all randomized participants who completed the training set -up 
visit 
iv. Intent to Treat (ITT) Fully -Evaluable (FE) population:  This is a secondary analysis 
population, defined as including all members of the ITT population that complete a 
post-intervention or V2 visit (the ITT -FEV2 population), or all members of the ITT

Page 7 of 7 population that completed a V3 or delayed follow up visit (t he ITT -FEV3 
population). Note that a participant may complete a specific visit but have missing 
data for a test in which case the participants is in the overall FE population but does 
not contribute data to the FE population for that visit, e.g., the numbe r of evaluable 
cases for a specific test on a specific visit may be smaller than the FE population for 
that visit because of missing data.  
v. Intent to Treat (ITT) Fully -Trained (FT) population:  This is a secondary analysis 
population, defined as including all members of the ITT -FE population who complete 
a target number of training visits (32 visits). Note that the FT populations are strict 
subsets of the FE populations; a person who completes the target number of training 
visits but does not complete the e valuation visit is not a member of the FT population.  
vi. Intent to Treat (ITT) Spatial -Bias (SB) population : This is a secondary analysis 
population, defined as including all members of the ITT population who demonstrate 
a bias in spatial attention that is nu merically greater on the ipsilesional side of space 
on the primary outcome measure ( Posner cueing task – field bias ).

Background  
Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common condition that affects  approximately [ADDRESS_93617] 2 signs or symptoms of rhinosinusitis (mucopurulent drainage, 
nasal obstruction, facial pain, pressure, fullness, or hyposmia) for at least 12 weeks as well as 
documented inflammation  on nasal endoscopy or radiographic imaging.3 Treatment is focused on 
decreasing mucosal inflammation, controlling infection, and improving mucociliary clearance.2 
Patients who are symptomatic despi[INVESTIGATOR_85875] 
(ESS). Given the chronic nature of the disease, CRS patients who have undergone endoscopic sinus 
surgery may continue to have intermitt ent, acute exacerbations of rhinosinusitis.  
There are no FDA approved treatments for acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis. The 
mainstay therapy is topi[INVESTIGATOR_85876] -directed oral antibiotics.[ADDRESS_93618] prevalent, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophillus spp, and 
STUDY00000407  
Version date: 03/07/[ADDRESS_93619] -ESS CRS patients with 
worsening symptoms and mucopurulence in the paranasal sinuses seen on nasal endoscopy. Up to 
100 potential subjects meeting the defined inclusion criteria will be approached during routine 
clinic visits with a goal for enrollment of 70 patients. Enrollment is defined as entering the study 
and receiving treatment.  We will screen more patients than will be enrolled, anticipating that 
approximately 30 patients will not be eligible for inclusion based on their culture results. Patients 
will not be eligible for inclusion if they are systemically ill at the time of their initial visit or if  they 
require antibiotic treatment prior to finalization of culture data. Justi fication for a sample size of 70 
(35 subjects per treatment group)  is based on the assumptions tha t (1) 90% of patients taking 
culture -directed oral antibiotics will experience a clinical and statistically significant improvement 
in Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI)  score at the end of therapy, and (2) The non -inferiority 
limit of topi[INVESTIGATOR_85877] 20% of oral therapy. Using a standard deviation of 20% and a power of

be no exclusion based on economic or educational disadvantage.  Prisoners will not be inclu ded in 
the study population due to difficulties coordinating  care  and administering nebuliza tion therapy.

Study Design  
Sinonas al cultures guided by [CONTACT_85897][INVESTIGATOR_85878] a Tami Sinus Secretion Collector 
(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) will be performed.  Aerobic cultures will be obtained, according to the 
clinical standard of care . If bilateral sinuses appear infected, representative cultures will be taken 
from each side. After suctioning purulent material, a sterile swab with flocked nylon fiber will be  
brushed along the mucosa in bilateral  maxillary sinus es The  swab s will be placed into separate 
storage buffer s for tra nsport to the laboratory  for further molecular analysis . Positive  cultures will 
be defined as 1+ or greater organism growth. Patients with positive cultures will be randomized to 
one of two treatment groups:  
(1) Daily o ral Levofloxacin with twice daily nebulized intranasal placebo  for 14 days, or  
(2) Daily o ral placebo with twice daily nebulized intranasal topi[INVESTIGATOR_85879] 14 days.  
STUDY00000407  
Version date: 03/07/[ADDRESS_93622] s will e nter the blinding process after  culture data  has been reviewed . A sealed envelope 
blinded to the investigators selecting either an oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_85880]  (Professional Arts Pharmacy, Lafayette, LA) . This will be based on a 
separate key that has been blinded to the investigators  that  will randomly assign a study 
participant to either an oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_85881] . The 
list will be maintained by [CONTACT_9137].  A saline rinse kit (Sinus Rinse, NeilMed, Santa 
Rosa, CA) and isotonic salt preparation will be supplied to the patient at their initial visit.  A nasal 
nebulizer (NasoNeb, Medinvent, White  Bear Lake, MN) and the topi[INVESTIGATOR_85882].  
Alternatively, instead of the pharmacy shippi[INVESTIGATOR_85883]’s home, subjects may pi[INVESTIGATOR_85884] e 
appropriate ly randomized  medication regimen from the otolaryngology  clinic  at Clinton Woods , 
with the prescription then sent to the participating pharmacy  (PAP) to refill the stock. The clinical 
technician at the clinic in charge of ordering and receivin g will be responsible for receipt and 
storage of the study medication, under the direction and supervision of the PI . The medication will 
be stored securely in the Clinical Trials office at Clinton Woods. The study drug will be labelled as 
“Regime A” or “R egime B” corresponding to the randomization scheme in order to ensure that the 
subject receives the correct medication. The study drug will be dispersed to the subject at the clinic 
by [CONTACT_978], or by [CONTACT_85898] (ENT attending, 
resident or mid -level provider). Patients will be contact[CONTACT_85899] [ADDRESS_93623] blinded to the treatment will repeat nasal endoscopy , 
cultures , and sinonasal brushings  to assess response. If there is no mucopurulent drainage within 
the sinonasal cavity, 3 cc of normal saline will be irrigated into the maxillary sinus and sent for 
culture . Change in Rhinosinusitis Disability In dex (RSDI)  scores will serve as the primary outcome. 
The RSDI  is a validated, rhinosinusitis -specific 30-item quality -of-life questionnaire.25 It relates the 
physical, functional, and emotional quality -of-life domains to rhinosinusitis. The survey is set up as 
an equal -appearing five point scale designated by [CONTACT_85900] “never”, “almost never”, “sometimes”, 
“almost always”, and “always”. Total scores range between  [ADDRESS_93624] (SNOT) -
22 scores,26 change  in nasal endoscopy findings using Perioperative Sinus Endoscopy (POSE) 
scores27, post -treatment culture negativity defined a s less than 1+ growth of organisms , and change 
in the total bacterial community following treatment as determined by [CONTACT_85901].  The 
study participants will be routinely followed in clinic with nasal endoscopy at 2 month intervals for 
STUDY00000407  
Version date: 03/07/201 9 
 up to 6 month s from the time of enrollment, or until the study is closed, to evaluate for disease 
recurrence or progression.  
 
Molecular Analysis  
For the molecular section of the study, samples will be collected via mucosal brushings and as 
detailed above in the Tami Sinus Secretion Collector. From the Collector, samples will be aseptically 
divided into two aliquots: one to the microbiology lab for conventional culturing, and one for 
molecular work. Each sample will be assigned a unique sa mple identification number (UID) that 
will be separated from the patient identification. This list will be administered by [CONTACT_20234]. Brushings and a liquots of the sample allocated to the molecular work will be 
transferred into lysis buffer for  RNA pyrosequencing 28. The remainder of the sample will be frozen, 
and maintained at -80C  for the remainder of the study .  
All of the collected samples of the study will be streaked for anaerobic growth in the research 
laboratory for speciation.  The primary  samples will then be analyzed for total bacterial 16s rRNA, 
allowing comparison of the microbiome within and between pre - and post -treatment in both study 
arms.  
It is anticipated that there may be patients that may not respond to the antibioti c treatment in 
either the oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_85885]. In this case, the samples that were banked at -
80C would be submitted for bacterial RNA transcriptional profiling. Additionally, the correlating 
banked nasal swab sample would be submit ted for human RNA transcriptional profiling. This will 
allow comparison of the genes expressed by [CONTACT_85902]. Similarly, it will also allow comparison of genes expressed by [CONTACT_85903] i n response to infection and therapy. Numbers of patients for this part of the study will be 
determined based on the failure of therapy rate.  
After original patient samples have been speciated, and antibiotic sensitivity has been assessed, 
cultures from the  Microbiology Lab will be given the correlating deidentified UID, and frozen at -
80C to allow potential future analysis of the isolated strains. Study of these strains will be 
conducted using the deidentified UID. Samples will be kept at -80 for the remain der of the study.

Any printed data will be stored in the study personnel’s  office in a locked file cabinet. Only the study 
personnel  will have access to identifying information. Research subjects will be given a unique 
study number that is stored separately from collected data. The results will be analyzed at the 
study’s completion. A data  safety monitoring plan will be ongoing and performed by [CONTACT_4520]. Any adverse events will be recorded and monitored for trends throughout the entire 
study period. Any serious adverse events will be scrutinized by [CONTACT_85904] . 
Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Risk Category  
This is a greater than minimal risk study since it is not necessarily routine to repeat a nasal 
endoscopy and culture following completion of antibiotic treatment, particularly if the patient is 
symptomatically improved.  
Potential Risk  
Potential risks to the subject include mild discomfort and nasal irritation secondary to nasal 
endoscopy, in addition to any added inconvenience for having to return to the clinic for re -
examination. There is a small risk of loss of privacy to the subjects. Genetic informati on obtained 
from human subjects will be limited to genes that are currently being expressed.  
The remainder of the study is within accordance to the current standards of clinical practice and 
will not add any additional risk to the patients. The oral and to pi[INVESTIGATOR_85887].[ADDRESS_93626] the 
patient’s care and they will be  treated according to the current standard of care employed by [CONTACT_85905]’s Rhinology clinic.  
Protection Against Risk  
Study participants will be deidentified using a unique study number. All protected health 
information will be securely st ored on a password -protected, encrypted share drive . Any written 
information will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in the PI’s office and will be disposed of in a 
protected health information bin after [ADDRESS_93627]’s participation in the research study will be reported to the University of [COMPANY_002]ster’s 
Research Subject Review Board (RSRB) as a summary in the annual pro gress report for the study.  
Serious, unexpected , and related to the study adverse events will be reported to the RSRB in a 
STUDY00000407  
Version date: 03/07/201 9 
 written report within ten calendar days of the study team being notified of the adverse event 
occurrence.  
Sample storage and confid entiality  
Collected samples will be assigned a unique sample identification number (UID) and placed into 
storage at –[ADDRESS_93628] requests, in writing, that their sample(s) be destroyed.  
A database will be developed to accompany the sample. Each case will be assigned a unique ID 
number and all identifiers will then be deleted, except for a single copy (key) containing the ID 
number, and medical record number. This database would provide cl inical and pathological 
parameters and contain the following information: date of collection, initials of attending physician, 
gender, date of birth, type of antibiotic used, clinical response to therapy and final microbial 
diagnosis. It may also contain p ertinent medical history and comorbidities, as well as social aspects 
of history, including tobacco use. Collection of information for the database will be the 
responsibility of [CONTACT_85910]. Study records will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in  the Princ ipal 
Investigator ’s office in  the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster  or on a 
password -protected encrypted share drive . The results of any research studies performed with the 
banked samples may be presented at meetings or in publica tions without disclosure of subject 
identity.  
Subject Identification, Recruitment and Consent  
Study subjects meeting the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited from the 
rhinology clinic at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center.  In addition, patients with a diagnosis 
of CRS that are status post bilateral sinus surgery but are not currently infected will be offered a 
flyer outlining the specifics of our study. The flyer will instruct the patients to call our research 
coordinator for a telephone screening. If eligible, they will be contact[CONTACT_85906]. Eligible patients will also have information about the study printed in their checkout 
materials via eRecord smartphrase, with instructions to contact [CONTACT_85907] a flare up. Similarly an eRecord smartphrase will be used to inform PCP that the patient may be 
study eligible if they present with a CRS flare up.  
Treatment options proposed are routinely used for CRS patients. This decrea ses the risk of any 
undue influence, as patients would be receiving one of these treatment regimens regardless of their 
inclusion in the study.  Patients electing to participate will undergo an informed consent process by 
[CONTACT_85908] s. The stud y will be explained at length and the consent form will be 
reviewed with the patient. All questions or concerns will be addressed to the patient’s  satisfaction. 
The subject will be given the option of reviewing the consent form at home  if desired. The deci sion 
to participate or not to participate will not alter their care in any way.  
Costs  
STUDY00000407  
Version date: 03/07/201 9 
 Costs to the patients will be minimal. The initial visit, nasal endoscopy, and culture are current 
clinical standards of practice and will be billed to the patient’s ins urance. The patient will not be 
charged for follow up visits , repeat cultures, medical supplies for the study, or medications 
prescribed.

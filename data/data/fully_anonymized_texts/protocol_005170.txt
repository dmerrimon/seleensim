2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide due to the majority of patients 
presenting with metastatic disease for which there is no cure.  In recent years, advances in the 
systemic treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have increased survival by [CONTACT_342893]-mutant NSCLC[1].  More efficacious therapi[INVESTIGATOR_342826] a direct result 
of our increased understanding and exploitation of the molecular basis of lung cancer. 
 
Platinum doublet chemotherapy has been the mainstay of NSCLC treatment with median OS of 
about 12 months. The discovery and targeting of oncogene driven subsets of NSCLC including 
EGFR-mutant NSCLC, which comprises about 15% of NSCLC has revolutionized treatment of 
lung cancer.  NSCLC tumors with EGFR-activating mutations are exquisitely sensitive to EGFR 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) with overall response rates (ORR) of approximately 60-
70%. However, resistance to currently approved EGFR-TKIs (afatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib) 
invariably develop with a median PFS of approximately 9-[ADDRESS_424572] mechanisms of 
resistance include target alterations such as EGFR T790M (~50-60%), which is the most 
common mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs and prevents the TKI from fastening 
to the ATP binding domain of EGFR, by[CONTACT_342894]3CA mutations, MET 
amplification and Her2 amplification (~20%) as well as target amplification of EGFR (~10%)[2, 
3].  
 
2.2 CTE P IND AGENTS  
 
2.2.1 OS I-774 (Erlotinib) 
 
Background  
 
 
OSI-774 (erlotinib, Tarceva®) is an orally active, potent, selective inhibitor of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_33927] (EGFR) tyrosine kinase [4]. OSI-774 inhibits the human EGFR tyrosine 
kinase with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 2 nM (0.786 ng/mL) in an in vitro  enzyme 
assay and reduces EGFR autophosphorylation in intact tumor cells with an IC 50 of 20 nM 
(7.86 ng/mL).  OSI-774 inhibits EGF-dependent proliferation of cells at submicromolar 
c
oncentrations and blocks cell-cycle progression in the G 1 phase.  
 
OS
I-774 appears to bind specifically to EGFR.  In a study of OSI-774 binding specificity, 
affinity of OSI-774 for 67 cellular receptors was examined [4].  OSI-774 was shown to bind with 
low 
affinity to peripheral benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (IC 50=2.5 µM [980 ng/ml]), adenosine A 1 (IC 50=6.8 
µM [2700 ng/ml]), and µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] (IC 50=7.0 µM [2800 ng/ml]) receptors.  Binding affinities were 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
8 1250 -fold higher than the IC 50 concentration needed to inhibit purified EGFR tyrosine kinase (2 
nM [0.79 ng/ml]).  When tested at concentrations up to 1 µM (390 ng/ml), no significant 
inhibition of ligand binding to 64 other neurotransmitter receptors, regulatory binding sites, 
calcium channels, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328], or neurotransmitter uptake sites were observed. 
 
Nonclinical Studies 
 
In mice, daily oral administration of OSI-774 for 20 days inhibited subcutaneous (SC) growth of 
the HN5 human head and neck carcinoma in a dose-dependent manner as compared to vehicle-
treated mice, with an estimated effective dose for 50% inhibition (ED 50) of 9.2 mg/kg/day [4].  
Treatment with 11 mg/kg/day of OSI-774 immediately halted growth or slightly decreased the 
size of HN5 tumors >[ADDRESS_424573]-treatment. Similar results were observed in A431 
squamous cell carcinoma xenografts at a dose of 11 mg/kg/day OSI-774 over 20 days.   
 
OSI-774 (10 mg/kg/day) has been studied in combination with cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-
fluorouracil, paclitaxel, vinorelbine tartrate, and gemcitabine [4].  No antagonism of therapeutic 
efficacy was observed, and additive effects were observed with cisplatin (10 mg/kg intravenous 
[IV] daily × 1), doxorubicin (15 mg/kg IV daily × 1), paclitaxel (10 mg/kg intraperitoneal [IP] 
daily × 5), and gemcitabine (100 mg/kg IP three times daily × 4).    
 
Nonc
linical toxicology studies in rats and dogs have included acute and long-term general 
toxicology, genetic toxicology, reproductive toxicology, and local tissue tolerance of OSI-774.  
Clinical signs of toxicity in rats and/or dogs following a single dose of OSI-[ADDRESS_424574] one species:  effects on the cornea (atrophy and ulceration); effects on 
the skin (follicular degeneration and inflammation, redness, and alopecia); atrophy of the ovary, 
lacrimal glands, and salivary glands; necrosis of the liver; papi[INVESTIGATOR_342827]; inflammation in the mandibular lymph nodes; hematopoiesis; delayed 
gastric emptying; and diarrhea.  Increases in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, and bilirubin were observed. 
 
OSI-774 causes maternal toxicity with associated embryo-fetal lethality and abortion in rabbits at 
doses 3 times those in humans (AUC at 150 mg daily dose).  However, when administered 
during organogenesis at plasma concentrations approximately equal to humans, no increase in 
embryo-fetal lethality or abortion in rats or rabbits was observed.  Female rats treated with doses 
0.[ADDRESS_424575] week of gestation had an 
increase in early resorptions.  No teratogenic effects were observed in rats or rabbits. 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
 
The total clearance of OSI-774 decreased with increasing dose, resulting in supraproportional 
increases in exposure (AUC) over the dose range of 1-2 mg/kg IV in rats and 0.5-7 mg/kg IV in

s [4].  In vitro , OSI-774 is slowly oxidized by [CONTACT_57136].  The majority of the 
absorbed dose is extensively metabolized in rats and dogs, and only a small amount is excreted 
as unchanged drug in urine, bile, and feces.  The oral bioavailability of an aqueous suspension is 
77% in rats and ~88% in dogs.  Plasma protein binding of OSI-774 ranges from 92% to 95% in 
man, monkey, rat, and mouse, and is 85% in the dog.  Corrected for protein binding of 95%, at 
the average plasma concentration responsible for 50% inhibition of tumor growth (oral dose of 
9.2 mg/kg/day in the murine/human tumor xenograft model), the unbound concentration of drug 
in the plasma is estimated to be 86 nM (34 ng/mL).  The estimated unbound concentration of 
OS
I-774 in plasma is consistent (4-fold higher) with the IC 50 for the in vitro cellular 
phosphot
yrosine reduction assay and is 43-fold higher than the IC 50 for the in vitro  (isolated 
enzyme) tyrosine kinase assay.  Finally, OSI-774 plasma protein binding depends on the levels 
of -1-acid glycoprotein (AAG).  Thus, AAG might be a significant determinant of 
pharmacokinetic and possibly pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationships in patients. 
 
Pharmac
okinetic Data 
 
OSI-774 pharmacokinetics were examined in patients with advanced solid tumors who were 
treated daily for 21 days. Plasma samples were collected on Days 1, 3, and 21 for analysis.  The

ter oral ingestion, the OSI-774 C max values (T max) were achieved at a median of 3 hours (range, 2 to 
12 hours). Both C max and AUC 0-24 values were roughly proportional to the OSI-774 dose in the range of 
25 to 200 mg/d (R2 = 0.33 and 0.46, respectively, on Day 1).  Inter-subject variability was moderate at 
the 150-mg/d dose level, as indicated by [CONTACT_342895] 64% for Day 1 AUC 0-24 and 
Cmax. 
 
Dose Rationale 
 
Dosing of erlotinib will be at the FDA approved dose of 150 mg daily. 
 
2.2.2 ON ALESPIB (Onalespib lactate) 
 
Background  
 
Onalespib (AT13387) is a synthetic non-ansamycin small molecule that acts as an inhibitor of 
he
at shock protein 90 (HSP90). HSP90 inhibitors are thought to affect multiple aberrant 
signaling pathways and may therefore be of clinical benefit in the treatment of a wide range of 
cancers. 
 
Nonclinical Studies 
 
Onalespib potently inhibits HSP90 in human tumor cell lines and demonstrates antitumor activity 
against human tumor cell line xenografts in mice. In vivo studies suggest that onalespib leads to 
a prolonged inhibition of HSP90 in tumors. In cancer xenograft models in mice (NSCLC driven 
by [CONTACT_342896]; vemurafenib-sensitive and -resistant melanoma), 
onalespib inhibited tumor growth and was best tolerated weekly or twice weekly. In upfront 
combination with kinase inhibitors, onalespib was able to delay the emergence of resistance i n 
melanoma and NSCLC xenograft models. 
 
The onset of onalespib toxicity was characterized by [CONTACT_342897], reduced food 
consumption, hematologic and clinical chemistry effects. Data were obtained in an acute pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480] (clinical observations and necropsy), DRF studies (clinical observations and clinical 
pathology and necropsy), and definitive studies (full toxicologic investigations). Results from 
these studies provide a clear pi[INVESTIGATOR_342828] a 1-hour 
infusion. 
 
The toxicity profile of onalespib was similar in rats and dogs. Both species exhibited decreased 
body weight and food consumption, and decreases in white blood counts, as well as clinical 
pathology changes. The overall effects observed in surviving rats and dogs were transient and 
reversible, with the exception of the testicular lesions observed in dogs at high doses which had 
not reversed during [ADDRESS_424576] article dosed groups on Study Days sampled

11 a
nd increased an approximately dose-related manner. No onalespib was detected in any control 
vehicle-dosed animal samples. There were no consistent gender differences. There was no 
significant accumulation or decrease in exposure upon repeat IV administration. Onalespib was 
essentially completely cleared from plasma by 24 hours. 
 
In rats, onalespib was administered over 1 hour, either through the tail vein or a femoral vein 
cannula, as a single dose or repeated. Both methods of administration were problematic in rats, 
as tail vein administration led to severe toxicity and femoral vein administration led to thrombus 
formation. In the definitive rat study, a surgically implanted femoral vein cannula was associated 
with thrombus formation and occasional early deaths, as confirmed by [CONTACT_342898].  
 
The main results from these studies were as follows: 
• C
linical pathology changes suggestive of adverse effects in various organs including bone 
marrow, kidney and liver were observed at doses ≥50 mg/kg, but histopathology was not 
examined 
• No unambiguous target organs of toxicity were identified, and the NOAEL was estimated to be 
50 mg/kg/dose given twice weekly for 3 weeks 
• Consequently a dose severely toxic to 10% of rodents (STD10) could not be confidently 
determined in rats although safety was established in this species 
I
n dogs, a clear dose-effect relationship was established for onalespib (administration through a 
peripheral vein). Dogs were more sensitive than rats on a dose basis (mg/kg and mg/m2) and an 
exposure basis (Cmax and AUC). Histopathology in dogs revealed changes in the bone marrow, 
thymus, testes, gall bladder, and kidney at 3, 10/7, and 12.5/10/7 mg/kg. The nominal HNSTD 
was 3 mg/kg/dose given twice weekly for 3 weeks. The NOAEL was taken to be 1mg/kg/dose on 
the same schedule. 
 
A subsequent repeat-dose study of two new onalespib formulations to assess potential acute 
toxicity and local infusion site irritation in rabbits revealed that higher pH (less acidic) 
phosphate-buffered formulation caused less infusion-site irritation. However, exposures in 
rabbits at the 25 mg/kg dose were more than 2-fold higher than in humans (at the MTD dose of 
260 mg/m2) and as a consequence, the repeat-dose regimen was not tolerated in rabbits, as 
mortalities occurred in all groups. Due to adverse findings secondary to cannulation in rats, as 
well as no detection of unambiguous target organs of toxicity in rats, an STD10 could not be 
confidently determined in the rat. A clear dose-related toxicity was established in dogs, including 
identification of target organs of toxicity; the NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/dose given 2QW×3 and the 
nominal HNSTD was 3 mg/kg/dose given 2QW×3. The dog was found to be more sensitive than 
the rat on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, as well as in exposure terms (Cmax and AUC). The human 
clinical start dose was calculated on a mg/m2 basis using accepted body surface area conversion 
factors (FDA 2005). Given its high sensitivity to onalespib, the dog was deemed an appropriate 
species for this purpose; therefore, the start dose was estimated as one-sixth of the nominal dog 
HNSTD (HNSTD = 3 mg/kg = 60 mg/m2), giving a human start dose of 10 mg/m2/dose given 
2QW×3. The human start dose calculated from the dog HNSTD is 3-fold lower than would be 
derived from the rat NOAEL (start dose based on one tenth of the rat NOAEL on a body surface 
area basis = 30 mg/m2/dose).

harmacokinetics 
 
• After intravenous (IV) administration to mice, rats, and dogs and intraperitoneal (IP) 
administration to mice, onalespib displayed a short plasma half-life in mice and rats (1-3 hours) 
and a moderate half-life in dogs (11 hours) despi[INVESTIGATOR_342829]. Volume of 
distribution was greater than total body water indicating distribution of onalespib into tissues. PK 
studi
es demonstrated that onalespib is highly distributed into xenograft tumors and is cleared 
slowly from tumors. 
 
 • The in vitro intrinsic clearance of onalespib determined in isolated intact hepatocytes was high 
a
cross all the species tested (mouse, rat, dog and human; scaled values ranged from 35 
mL/min/kg in human to 184 mL/min/kg in rat). 
 
 • Binding of onalespib to plasma proteins was moderate and comparable across all species 
teste
d, ranging from 77.2% in dog plasma to 90.1% in mouse plasma. 
 
 • Blood:plasma distribution in mouse, rat, dog and human whole blood ranged from 0.8, 
indi
cating approximately equal distribution between the plasma and cellular fraction, to 5.0, 
showing that onalespib favored partitioning into the red blood cells, depending on concentration 
and species. 
 
 • The potential for onalespib to inhibit cytochromes P450 (CYP) 1A2, 3A4, 2D6, 2C9, and 
2C19 was assessed, and results indicated a concentration giving half-maximal inhibition (IC50) 
>10μM, suggesting a low potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions mediated by 
[CONTACT_36918]. 
 
• Onalespib is a substrate for P-gp, a modest inhibitor of BCRP and P-gp, and strong inhibitor of 
MATE1 and MATE2- K. 
 
 • Glucuronidation, sulphation and N-oxidation appear to be routes of metabolism for onalespib 
ba
sed on in vitro studies of cryopreserved hepatocytes as well as metabolites detected in samples 
in vivo. 
 
 • In a radiolabeled mass balance study in dogs, a mean maximum measured concentration 
(Cmax) of 793 ng-Eq/g occurred at the end of infusion. Area under the curve concentration-time 
curve from time [ADDRESS_424577] data point (AUC0-t) values were 5924 hr•ng-Eq/g and 7590 hr•ng-
Eq/g for male and female dogs, respectively, with halflife (t1/2) values of 21.3 and 20.5 hour, 
respectively. The majority (~83% in the male and ~72% in the female) of [14C]onalespib-
derived radioactivity was excreted via feces, with less found in urine (~15% in the male and 
~22% in the female). 
 
• The PK of onalespib showed dose-dependent increase in AUC0-t and Cmax from 10 to 310 
mg/m2/dose with relatively low inter-individual variability. Elimination half-life (t1/2 el) was 
dose-independent with mean cohort values ranging from 6.6 to 11.5 hours. Maximum t1/2 
observed was 14 hours. There was no notable accumulation or reduction in exposures between 
Day 1 and Day 18 (twice weekly) or Day 1 and Day 15 (once weekly) of Cycle 1.

 • The onalespib PK profile and exposures were similar across several studies, whether as a 
sing
le agent (ONALESPIB-01) or in combination with imatinib (ONALESPIB-02), abiraterone 
acetate (ONALESPIB-04), or crizotinib (ONALESPIB-05), at comparable dose levels, indicating 
no potential for
 interactions affecting onalespib PK by [CONTACT_170149]. 
 
 • Plasma increases in HSP70 were detected at all dose levels in Study ONALESPIB-01. HSP70 
inductio
n is a pharmacodynamic marker of target engagement, but has not been demonstrated to 
be predictive of clinical response.

Dose Rationale 
 
Dedicated drug-drug interaction studies have not been conduct ed. However, The potential for 
onalespib to inhibit cytochromes P450 (CYP) 1A2, 3A4, 2D6, 2C9, and 2C19 was assessed, and 
results indicated a concentration giving half-maximal inhibition (IC50) >10μM, suggesting a low 
potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions mediated by [CONTACT_36918]. Olanespib 
PK does not appear to be affected when coadministered with imatinib (ONALESPIB-02), 
abiraterone acetate (ONALESPIB-04), or crizotinib (ONALESPIB-05). PK studies of 
ONALESPIB and assessment of drug-drug interactions with erlotinib will be conducted in this 
study. Erlotinib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and CYP3A5 in liver and intestine, and to 
a lesser extent, by [CONTACT_097]1A2 and CYP2C8. While caution is recommended when  erlotinib is co-
administered with either strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5, there is no evidence that 
onalespib  will impact the metabolic clearance of erlotinib.  
 
 
This phase 1 trial dose escalates onalespib to the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) to a 
maximum of 220 mg/m2 once weekly, which is the MTD and/or RP2D for other combination 
studies of onalespib (combination with imatinib, crizotinib in ALK rearranged NSCLC, or 
a
biraterone acetate+ steroid). 
 
2.3 Rationale for Trial 
 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
15 EGF
R-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) such as erlotinib have revolutionized treatment of 
advanced NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor EGFR activating mutations (EGFR+). 
Unfortunately, on average 30-40% of these patients do not respond to EGFR inhibitors and 
resistance invariably develops with a median PFS of 9-10 months[5, 6]. Mechanisms of 
resistance to erlotinib include: EGFR T790M mutations (~50%), MET, EGFR and Her2 
amplification (~30%), EMT and small cell transformation (~10%) and acquired PIK3CA 
mutations (~10%)[2, 3].  
 
There is an unmet clinical need for new active therapi[INVESTIGATOR_342830]-TKIs and improve clinical outcomes in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. 
 
Current approaches to address this unmet need include second generation EGFR-TKIs such as 
afatinib (recently approved in the first line setting for treatment of metastatic EGFR-mutant 
NSCLC[7]) though it has not been directly shown to be superior to 1st generation EGFR-TKIs 
such as erlotinib or gefitinib in the first line setting and single agent response rates to afatinib in 
patients who have progressed on 1st generation EGFR-TKIs are low (~7%).[8] Third generation 
EGF
R-TKIs such as AZD9291 and CO-[ADDRESS_424584] generation EGFR-TKIs with high response rates (50-60%) in patients whose 
tumors harbor the EGFR-T790M resistance mutation, though they are mainly specific for EGFR-
T790M with less selectivity and much lower response rates in patients with EGFR-mutant 
NSCLC lacking EGFR-T790M[9, 10].  
 
Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that participates in stabilizing and activating hundreds of client 
proteins. In cancer cells, Hsp90 preferentially protects mutated and overexpressed oncoproteins 
from misfolding and degradation[11]. The Hsp90 inhibitor onalespib potently inhibits Hsp90 
c
haperone activity and promotes degradation of numerous client proteins including many 
oncoproteins that mediate resistance to erlotinib. Maintaining prolonged knockdown of Hsp90 
client proteins with Hsp90 inhibitors has been a challenge in the development of this class of 
drugs in NSCLC[12]. Oncoprotein knockdown by [CONTACT_342900] 
a
nd xenotransplants, offering a potential advantage of onalespib over other Hsp90 inhibitors in 
de
velopment[13]. onalespib has single agent activity and is synergistic with erlotinib in EGFR+ 
NSC
LC cell lines and xenotransplants[14, 15]. Since Hsp90 inhibitors preferentially degrade 
several overexpressed oncoproteins known to mediate resistance to erlotinib (including EGFR 
T790M, Her2, PIK3CA, MET) and multiple mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance can exist 
within the same tumor[16], we hypothesize that onalespib added to erlotinib can circumvent or 
de
lay EGFR-TKI resistance in a broad population of EGFR-mutant NSCLC and target multiple 
mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance that may exist within the same patient[16].

Compared to the two classic EGFR mutations (EGFR Exon 19 deletions and EGFR L858R) 
EGFR exon 20 insertions are less common EGFR mutations that are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_342831]-TKIs with reported response rates <10%[17]. Hsp90 inhibitors have pre-clinical activity 
in EGFR Exon 20 insertions with cell line evidence showing Exon 20 insertions with interaction 
and dependence on Hsp90[18]. Generating in vivo models of exon 20 insertions as we proposed 
with the creation of patient derived xenografts is critical to developi[INVESTIGATOR_342832]-mutation. Clinical activity of Hsp90 inhibition has been recently described 
with the Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 in NSCLC patients with EGFR-Exon 20 Insertions (Z. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_342833], ASCO 2015). However, night blindness and other toxicities may inhibit further 
development of this HSP90 inhibitor. This trial combines onalespib with erlotinib in a dedicated

with
 a low single agent EGFR-TKI response rate (RR 5-10%)[17].

Membranes were probed sequentially for Hsp90 and EGFR as shown. ( B) Stability, autophosphorylation, and downstream

Materials and Methods. Individual membranes were probed as indicated. The EGFR phosphorylation sites examined form 
docking sites linking the activated receptor to various downstream effectors: EGFR/pY1068 associates with Grb2, Stat3/5, and 
Gab1; EGFR/pY1173 associates with Shp1 and Ptp1; EGFR/pY992 associates with PLC γ and Shc; and EGFR/pY1045 associates 
with Cbl. (C ) A549 cells, expressing wild-type EGFR, were treated with 17-AAG as shown. Cells were lysed and processed as 
described in Materials and Methods, and Western blots were probed as in ( B) above. (From Xu et al, British Journal of Cancer

P
lasma cfDNA (Guardant 360) (Integrated Biomarker) 
 
Description of the Assay 
 
Guardant360 is a cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) targeted next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) panel that is indicated for the prevention of a repeat invasive biopsy when the initial 
biopsy is QNS or unavailable/unobtainable as well as when cancer has progressed or recurred 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391]. It is an advanced diagnostic laboratory test (ADLT) offered by a sole source 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified and College of American 
Pathology (CAP)-accredited laboratory. This solid tumor profiling panel sequences [ADDRESS_424587] [1]. The genes are selected because mutations in these genes have FDA-
approved matched therapi[INVESTIGATOR_342836]. The panel also includes 
genomic markers of acquired resistance that may require a change in pharmacotherapy. 
 
Advantages of the Guardant360 cell-free DNA (cfDNA) NGS methodology versus solid tumor 
tissue-based NGS are:  
1. An invasive needle or surgical biopsy is avoided with cfDNA, reducing costs and 
complications.  
2. C fDNA provides a quantitative  measure (concentration or mutant allele frequency) of 
mutations present whereas solid tumor biopsy typi[INVESTIGATOR_342837] a qualitative result 
(mutation either present or not detected). The quantitative result may be followed over 
time to monitor response to treatment and evolution of acquired resistance.  
3. C fDNA sequencing identifies both germline and somatic mutations.  
4. The  assay failure rate is for cfDNA is essentially null (0.5% in the first 2,000+ samples) 
compared to 15%-25% failure rates of tissue-based NGS related to insufficient quantity 
of tissue (QNS).  
The key differentiator of the Guardant360 cfDNA NGS panel compared to other ctDNA panels 
is that the latter are limited to hotspot or “hot exon” analysis due to the high false positive rates 
related to longer sequencing regions at the low concentrations encountered with ctDNA. The 
high rates of false positives with current NGS assays when tumor DNA is in very low 
concentrations has limited the majority of methods for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to 
hotspot analyses, amplicon sequencing approaches and/or typi[INVESTIGATOR_342838] 1-5% of total circulating cfDNA. To overcome these limitations, 
Guardant360 utilizes algorithmic methods to encode and ultimately decode inputs and outputs 
from massively parallel deep sequencing analysis. By [CONTACT_342903]-transmission, this NGS method, known as Digital SequencingTM, enables signal 
interference to be reduced by [CONTACT_342904] [2]. With high enough sensitivity 
and specificity to robustly quantitate ctDNA from blood, this approach has the potential to 
evaluate the multiple genomic targets required in NCCN guidelines, to act as a “summary” of the 
different tumor clones in patients with intra-tumor and inter-tumor heterogeneity [3], and to 
prevent the time delays, costs and complications inherent in invasive biopsies. The analytical and 
clinical validation of Guardant360 is conducted in conformance with evidentiary standards 
established by [CONTACT_342905] (STARD), REporting of

Prevention (EGAPP), and the recent Next-generation Sequencing: Standardization of Clinical 
Testing (Nex-StoCT) biomarker guidelines [4–7].  
 
M
ethodology 
 
The Guardant360 ctDNA next generation sequencing assay identifies single nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) in 68 genes and includes complete exon coverage of 29 genes and coverage of partial 
exons (“hot exons”) in 39 genes, including copy number variants in 16 genes (see figure at end 
of this report). 
 
The gene list was selected to focus on those genomic alterations that are currently actionable 
defined as being targets of sensitivity or resistance to an FDA-approved ma tched therapy and/or 
a targeted therapy in clinical trials. The test simultaneously sequences the 68 cancer-related 
genes to an average depth of coverage of greater than 10,000X. To summarize, cell-free DNA is 
extracted from plasma and genomic alterations are analyzed by [CONTACT_342906]- by-sequencing of amplified target genes utilizing an Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 platform 
complemented by [CONTACT_342907]- to-end process optimization including conversion of cell-free 
DNA fragments into digital sequences, improvements in the Illumina next generation sequencing 
process itself, followed by [CONTACT_342908] a 
quantitative percentage of total cell-free DNA.  
 
Two 10mls of whole blood are collected in Streck Cell-Free DNA Blood Collection (Streck) 
tubes, which contain a proprietary formaldehyde-free preservative in that stabilizes white blood 
cells, preventing the release of genomic DNA and allowing shippi[INVESTIGATOR_342839], cold bricks or preliminary centrifugation prior to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
Af
ter digital libraries are produced, the sample is sequenced and post-sequencing data is 
processed using bioinformatics algorithms to quantify the absolute number of unique DNA 
fragments at a given nucleotide position. This proprietary process is referred to as Digital 
S
equencingTM and enables reporting of the fractional concentration (mutant allele frequency) of a 
g
iven SNV. Circulating ce ll-free DNA is mostly derived from leukocyte lysis (germline) and 
g
enerally a much smaller amount of tumor DNA is derived from cancer cell apoptosis/necrosis. 
All of the cell-free DNA fragments, including leukocyte-derived and tumor-derived, are 
sim
ultaneously sequenced with up to single molecule sensitivity. In other words, both tumor 
DNA and “normal”/germline DNA are sequenced and measured in the same sequencing assay. 
The fractional concentration or mutant allele frequency for a given mutation is calculated as the 
fraction of circulating tumor DNA harboring that mutation in a background of wild-type cell-free 
DNA fragments. The analytic sensitivity reaches detection of 1-2 single mutant fragments from a 
10 ml blood sample.  
 
L
everaging the ability of Digital Sequencing™ to absolutely quantify the number of unique 
DN
A fragments in a sequenced sample, the copy number of a given gene in plasma may be 
ascertained. To determine the copy number variant (CNV) or amplification of a given gene, we 
first measure the total number of unique fragments covering each gene. The mode of the 
normalized number of fragments covering each gene is calculated to estimate the fragment

Version Date: March 9, [ADDRESS_424590] for EGFR-TKI (OA Zill, Cancer Discovery 2015). 
 
P
harmacokinetics (Integrated biomarker) 
 
The
re are no expected interactions between onalespib and erlotinib. As this combination has not 
be
en explored before we will send a subset of samples for pharmacokinetic analysis conducted 
by a third party bioanalytical laboratory selected by [CONTACT_342909]. 
 
Multiplex Immunofluorescence Assay (MIFA) of Hsp90 Target Genes (Exploratory 
Biomarker) 
 
Maintaining prolonged knockdown of Hsp90 client proteins with Hsp90 inhibitors has been a 
challenge in the development of this class of drugs [9]. A critical component of successful drug 
development of Hsp90 inhibitors is demonstrating pharmacodynamic (PD) knockdown of client 
oncoproteins related to erlotinib resistance in patients. A major obstacle to lung cancer research 
is the paucity of diagnostic tissue available for biomarker analysis – often limited to a single core 
ne
edle biopsy. Our approach minimizes usage of precious clinical specimens by [CONTACT_342910] a single slide and detects co-expression of key resistance factors in a single 
tumor cell. In contrast to traditional fluorescent imaging, bright-field conversion allows 
assessment by [CONTACT_342911]. 
 
This 
technique will be used to simultaneously assess tumor expression of EGFR exon 19 del, 
EGFR L858R, EGFR wild-type, MET and HER2 in biopsied specimens using a Nuance 2 
Multispectral Imaging System Model (Perkin Elmer) attached to an Olympus fluorescent 
microscope and inForm advanced image analysis software. 
 
The
 Mack laboratory at UC Davis has extensive experience in the MIFA assay including 
incorporation into NCI sponsored studies such as SWOG [ADDRESS_424591] study of the mTOR 
inhibitor everolimus as adjuvant therapy in Renal Cell Carcinoma and FGF/FGFR. 
 
W
e are currently optimizing the assay to deploy in this clinical trial with optional biopsies at 
baseline and on treatment shortly after receiving onalespib. Demonstrating in vivo on-target 
a
ctivity of Hsp90 inhibition in this disease will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying 
potential clinical benefit of the treatment combination; demonstrate proof-of-principle for 
prolonged Hsp90 client oncoprotein knockdown in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated 
with erlotinib and onalespib and aid in the identification of subsets of patients with EGFR-
mut
ant NSCLC who may preferentially benefit from this combination. 
 
Using MIFA, we hypothesize that we can detect changes in Hsp90, Hsp70 and client 
oncoproteins that may mediate resistance to EGFR-TKI (MET, Her2, EGFR overexpression) in 
pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies with erlotinib and onalespib.

23 On
copanel (Next Generation Sequencing) (Exploratory Biomarker) 
 
EGF
R-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) such as erlotinib have revolutionized treatment of 
advanced NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor EGFR activating mutations (EGFR+). 
Unfortunately, resistance to EGFR-TKIs invariably develops, with a median PFS of 9-1 1 
months[5, 6]. Acquired EGFR T790M mutations that prevent the EGFR-TKI from fastening to 
the ATP-binding domain via steric hindrance is the most common mechanism of resistance (~50-
60%). Other mechanisms of resistance include: BRAF mutations, NF1 loss, MET, EGFR and 
Her2 amplification (~30%), EMT, small cell transformation (~10%) and acquired PIK3CA 
mutations (~10%)[2, 3]. Mechanisms of resistance to erlotinib in combination with Hsp90 
inhibition are unknown. In addition to the most common EGFR-TKI resistance mechanism 
(EGFR T790M), we plan an exploratory analysis via next generation sequencing to 
comprehensively explore mechanisms of resistance prior to initiation of onalespib and erlotinib 
a
nd at progression on this trial to further define mechanisms of resistance to the combination.  
 
P
atient Derived Xenografts (PDXs) (Exploratory Biomarker) 
 
Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) recapi[INVESTIGATOR_342840], histological and treatment 
response profile of the original patient tumor. This enables the efficacy of modified or alternative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_342841] a controlled, laboratory setting to identify regimens with enhanced 
activity and ability to overcome patient-specific resistance mechanisms emergent in the study 
population. Co-investigators at The Jackson Laboratory and UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer 
Center have a wealth of experience in establishing, maintaining and testing PDX models derived 
from NSCLC[20]. 
 
We plan to establish patient-derived xenografts from fresh tumor samples collected at the time 
initiation and acquired resistance to study therapy.  
 
Establishment of cell cultures and/or patient-derived xenografts from fresh samples collected at

corneal sensitivity test (Schirmer test or similar tear production test). 
 
3.3 In clusion of Women and Minorities 
 
N
IH policy requires that women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations be 
included in all NIH-supported biomedical and behavioral research projects involving NIH-
defined clinical research unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes to 
the satisfaction of the funding Institute & Center ( IC) Director that inclusion is inappropriate 
with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research.  Exclusion under other 
circumstances must be designated by [CONTACT_25513], NIH, upon the recommendation of an IC 
Director based on a compelling rationale and justification.  Cost is not an acceptable reason for 
exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources.  Women of 
childbearing potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical research.

4.3 P atient Registration 
 
4.3.1 OPEN / IWRS 
 
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network 
(OPEN).  OPEN is a web-based registration system available to users on a 24/7 basis.  It 
is i
ntegrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data interchange 
and with the Theradex Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for retrieval of patient 
re
gistration/randomization assignment.  Patient enrollment data entered by [CONTACT_33979] 
/ IWRS will automatically transfer to the NCI’s clinical data management system, 
Medidata Rave. 
 
For trials with slot reservation requirements, OPEN will connect to IWRS at enrollment 
initiation to check slot availability.  Registration staff should ensure that a slot is 
ava
ilable and secured for the patient before completing an enrollment. 
 
• Site staff with the appropriate roles will reserve slots using IWRS 
(https://open.ctsu.org/).  
• City of Hope Cancer Center will receive notification via the IWRS when a slot has been 
reserved. An email will be sent from the City of Hope Cancer Center to the site 
requesting further information such as: the patient initials, tumor type and potential start 
date. The spot will show as ‘pending approval’ in the system until the site sends a 
REGISTRATION FORM/ELIGIBILITY CHECKLIST accompanied with the signed 
consent, baseline labs, pathology report, CT/x-ray reports to the City of Hope Cancer 
Center at c [EMAIL_6656]  for review and confirmation of eligibility.  
• Once the Registration has been reviewed, the City of Hope Cancer Center will either 
approve or disapprove the request depending on confirmation of patient eligibility. If 
approved, the City of Hope Cancer Centre will update the spot to ‘reserved’ in IWRS.  
• The site can now enroll the patient into the study in OPEN.  
 
The OPEN system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registration and 
treatment information.  Please print this confirmation for your records.  
 
4.3.2 OPEN/ IWRS User Requirements 
 
OPEN/IWRS users must meet the following requirements: 
 Ha ve a valid CTEP-IAM account (i.e. , CTEP username [CONTACT_2383]). 
 To enroll patients or request slot reservations:  Be on an ETCTN Corresponding 
or Participating Organization roster with the role of Registrar.   Registrars must 
hold a minimum of an AP registration type.  If a DTL is required for the study, 
the registrar(s) must also be assigned the OPEN Registrar task on the DTL ( Note: 
A DTL is NOT required for this study) .   
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
32  To approve slot reservations or access cohort management:  Be identified to 
Theradex as the “Client Admin” for the study.  
 Have regulatory approval for the conduct of the study at their site. 
 
Prior to accessing OPEN/IWRS, site staff should verify the following: 
 All eligibility criteria have been met within the protocol stated timeframes. Site 
staf
f should use the registration forms provided on the CTSU web site as a tool to 
ve
rify eligibility. 
 If applicable, all patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA 
authorization form.

Erlotinib Administration 
 
 Tablets should be taken once daily preferably in the morning with up to 200 mL of water 
1 hour before or 2 hours after food. 
 
 I f the patient vomits after taking the tablets, the dose is replaced only if the tablets can 
actually be seen and counted. 
 
 Patients should log in their daily dose onto a “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_13355],” including missed, skipped, or 
vomited doses. 
 
 P atients should wear sunscreen protection, hat, and long sleeves to avoid sun as it can 
exacerbate skin rash. 
 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
34  O n the day of the PK studies, i.e., C1D8, erlotinib is to be administered 30 minutes 
before the administration of Onalespib IV. Please see Section 9.1.3 for additional 
information. 
 
5.2 De finition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
 
All toxicities will be graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE Version 5.0. The 
oc
currence of any of the following toxicities during Cycle 1 will be considered a DLT, if judged 
by [CONTACT_110515], probably or definitely related to study drug administration: 
 
   ≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic toxici ty 
 
 Ex cept nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that can be controlled by [CONTACT_342914]  ≤ grade 1 within 48 hours with medical 
intervention 
 
 Ex cept electrolyte toxicities that can be corrected to ≤ grade 1 or baseline within 48 hours 
 
 Gr ade 3 rash attributed to the combination will be considered a DLT if grade 3 despi[INVESTIGATOR_342842] (including oral antibiotic, topi[INVESTIGATOR_217901]) for > 72 
hours 
 
 F ebrile neutropenia; grade 4 neutropenia for >7 days 
 
 Thrombocytopenia <25,000/mm3 (grade 4) if associated with: 
• A bleeding event which does not result in hemodynamic instability but requires an 
elective platelet transfusion, or 
• A life-threatening bleeding event which results in urgent intervention and admission 
to an Intensive Care Unit 
• Gr ade 5 toxicity (i.e., death) 
 
 Pneumonitis ≥ grade 3 
 
 Delay in starting cycle 2 of ≥ 14 days due to toxicity related to one or more protocol 
drugs 
 
 I nfusion related reactions such as hypersensitivity reaction from o nalespib will not be 
assessed as a DLT regardless of grade. 
 
Dose intensity in cycles beyond cycle 1 will be considered in the assessment of the 
recommended phase 2 dose. To be evaluable for a DLT, 75% of dose must have been 
administered in cycle 1 unless a DLT occurred. 
 
Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are outlined in 
Section 5  and Section 6 . 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
35  
5.3 Dose  Escalation Guidelines 
 
Dose
 escalation will proceed within each cohort according to the following scheme.  Dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined above.  Patients will be considered to have received an 
informative course of therapy for the purpose of dose escalation rules if: (a) after any amount of 
stud
y drug, the patient suffers a DLT, or the course is curtailed to prevent an impending DLT; or 
(b)
 the patient receives all three planned infusions of Onalespib and at least 75% of the planned 
dose of erlotinib.   The patient will be considered fully followed for their initial course if either a 
DLT is reported, or the adverse event form indicates that reporting is complete for the course.  
Patients who hav e not received an informative and fully followed first course of therapy will be 
re
placed to obtain the necessary denominator for the dose-escalation rules. 
 
Number of Patients with DLT at a 
Given Dose Level  Escalation Decision Rule  
0 out of 3  Enter 3 patients at the next dose level.  
≥2 Dose escalation will be stopped.  This dose level will be 
declared the maximally administered dose (highest dose 
administered).  Three (3) additional patients will be 
entered at the next lowest dose level if only [ADDRESS_424608] 3 more patients at this dose level.  
 If 0 of these 3 patients experience DLT, proceed to 
the next dose level.  
 If 1 or more of this group suffer DLT, then dose 
escalation is stopped, and this dose is declared the 
maximally administered dose.  Three (3) additional 
patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level 
if only 3 patients were treated previously at that dose.  
≤[ADDRESS_424609] or with the potential for drug interactions. The 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
36 potential tar
gets for drug interaction can involve, but are not limited to CYP450, glucuronidation, 
P-glycoprotein, protein binding, or reduced absorption from proton-pump inhibitors.  Drugs that 
are known to increase torsades de pointes should be avoided. Check the study agent 
Investigator’s Brochure for potential sources of drug interactions.  The study team should check 
a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of.  Appendix 
B (Patient Drug Information Handout and Wallet Card) should be provided to patients if 
available. 
 
Erlotinib 
 
Rash:  In some patients, rash appeared to be treatable with standard acne therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_342843]. Anecdotal reports of improvement have occurred 
with any of the following: minocycline, topi[INVESTIGATOR_027], topi[INVESTIGATOR_47288], topi[INVESTIGATOR_128224], diphenhydramine, or oral prednisone (short course).  
 
Diarrhea:  Previous trials have shown that the frequency and severity of diarrhea rarely hindered 
administration of Erlotinib (OSI-774) and could be managed with loperamide. The recommended 
dose 
is loperamide [ADDRESS_424610] onset, followed by 2 mg every 2–4 hours until diarrhea-free for 
12 hour
s. 
 
Drugs affecting gastric pH 
 Avoid concomitant use of Erlotinib (OSI-774) with proton pump inhibitors if possible.  
S
eparation of doses may not eliminate the interaction since proton pump inhibitors affect 
the pH of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract for an extended period. 
 I f treatment with an H2-receptor antagonist such as ranitidine is required, Erlotinib ( OSI-
774) must be taken [ADDRESS_424611]. 
 Although the effect of antacids on Erlotinib (OSI-774) pharmacokinetics has not been 
e
valuated, the antacid dose and the Erlotinib (OSI-774) dose should be separated by 
[CONTACT_342912], if an antacid is necessary. 
 
Onalespib Infusion Reaction 
Local infusion-related irritation and systemic infusion reactions may occur during or shortly after 
the administration of onalespib.  The local infusion adverse events are formulation-related (pH of 
c
urrent formulation is ~ 4.0). Systemic adverse events (e.g.; flushing, itching, rigors, chills, nausea, 
tachycardia/bradycardia, dizziness) are reversible.  If that occurs, slow the infusion rate and/or 
hydrate with D5W.  Premedication with dexamethasone, antihistamine and 5HT3 antagonists can 
also be given. 
 
 
5.5 Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue until one of 
the following criteria applies: 
 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
37  Disea
se progression, 
 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s), 
 
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or 
 
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_424612]. Patients removed from study for unacceptable 
adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_424613] be documented in the Case 
Report Form. 
 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
Dose modification criteria 
 
If an adverse event that qualifies as a DLT (including those that occur beyond Cycle 1) is 
observed in any subject, the dose should be withheld until there is sufficient recovery that 
satisfies the study eligibility criteria in terms of organ function. Dosing may be resumed in that 
subject, after recovery, but at a reduced dose [ADDRESS_424614]’s dose may be reduced for a ≥ Grade 2 toxicity, if the Investigator deems 
it necessary.  
 
Interstitial Lung Disease (Pneumonitis) 
 
Careful assessment of all patients with an acute onset and/or unexplained worsening of 
pulmonary symptoms (dyspnea, cough, fever) should be performed to exclude interstitial lung 
disease (ILD). Study drugs should be interrupted pending investigation of these symptoms. If 
interstitial lung disease is determined to be related to study drugs , study drugs must be 
pe
rmanently discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as necessary.  
Dose Modifications for Erlotinib

Dose Modifications for Onalespib 
 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
40 The
 dose levels for this study are as follows:  
 
• Starting dose: 150 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle,  
• Escalation to dose levels of 180 mg/m2 then to 220 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks in a 4-week 
cycle, and  
• Dose reduction to 120 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle.  
 
If dose reduction of onalespib is required or deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093], onalespib 
shoul
d be reduced to the doses outlined in the following table.  
 
onalespib  IV  
(Day 1, Day 8, Day 15)  Reduce Dose of onalespib  IV 
(Day 1, Day 8, Day 15)  
220 mg/m2 180 mg/m2 
180 mg/m2 150 mg/m2 
150 mg/m2 120 mg/m2 
 
No further dose reduction levels are permitted beyond 120 mg/m2. The patient must then discontinue 
onalespib . If the investigator determines the patient is deriving clinical benefit from erlotinib, 
erlotinib may be continued as a single agent at the investigators discretion. 
 
Specific dose reduction schemes for erlotinib and onalespib  for diarrhea and skin toxicity are 
outlined below. 
 
Diarrhea Management on Erlotinib and Onalespib  
 
Patients should be instructed to use loperamide for the prevention of diarrhea and initiate upon 
the first loose stool ([ADDRESS_424617] onset, followed by 2mg every 2-4 hours until diarrhea resolves 
for 12 hours). Patients should notify their physician immediately at the first signs of poorly 
formed or loose stool or an increased frequency of bowel movements. Administration of 
antidiarrheal agents is recommended at the first sign of diarrhea as initial management. 
Loperamide is recommended as standard first line therapy. Alternatively, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_342844]. Additional agents to consider in subjects with diarrhea that is refractory to the above 
include deodorized tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_342845] (Benson, Ajani et al. 2004). Some subjects 
may require concomitant therapy with loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and deodorized 
tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_342846]. The dose modification guidance the tables below should be 
followe
d. In addition, general supportive measures should be implemented including continuous 
oral hydration, correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, small frequent meals, and 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151947]-containing products, high fat meals and alcohol.

Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs ( Section 7.1 ) and the characteristics of an observed AE ( Section 7.2 ) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting 
System (CTEP-AERS ) in addition  to routine reporting.

The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764].  In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset of AEs , 
the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column 
and is identified with bold and italicized text.  Th e SPEER is a list of events that are protocol-

 CAEPR for Onalespib (AT13387) (NSC 749712) 
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the 
S
pecific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for 
further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 119 patients. Below is the CAEPR for 
AT13387 (Onalespib). 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses 
next to the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple 
investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades 
to determine if expedited reporting is required.

7.3.3 Ex pedited Reporting Guidelines 
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol-specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports. 
 
Note:  A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting, regardless of 
causality.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided. 
 
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease Progression” 
in 
the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions.”  
Evide
nce that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological 
changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a 
disease process) should be submitted.  
 
Phase 1 and Early Phase 2 Studies:  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse 
Events that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within [ADDRESS_424623] Administration 
of the Investigational Agent/Intervention 1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342864] ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threate ning, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR  312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to the NCI via  electronic 
submission wi thin the timeframes detailed in the table below.

54 NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR.  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The A E must initially be submitted electronically within  24 hours of learning 
of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -hour report.  
o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted electronically within [ADDRESS_424624] administration of investigational 
agent/interven tion and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by [CONTACT_432] 5 calendar days for:  
 All Grade 3, 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
 Grade [ADDRESS_424625] whole day, after the agent/intervention was last  administered.  Footnote “1” above 
applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, [ADDRESS_424626]. 
 
7.5 S econdary Malignancy 
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
tre
atment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported expeditiously via CTEP-AERS.  Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
 
 L eukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
 Tr eatment-related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
55  
7.6 S econd Malignancy 
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE 
reporting unless otherwise specified. 
 
 
8. P HARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational agen ts 
administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1 . 
 
8.1 CTEP IND Agent(s)

 100 mg  – “T” and “100” in gray print 
 150 mg  – “T” and “150” in maroon print 
 
Storage :  Store at 25 °C (77 °F); excursions permitted to 15 ° – 30° C  (59 ° – 86°F). 
 
Route of Administration :  Oral. 
  
M
ethod of Administration :  
 
 Tablets should be taken once daily preferably in the morning with up to 200 mL of water one 
hour before or two hours after food. 
 
 Administration through G-tube: Dissolve the dose in 100 mL of sterile water, and shake it 
vigorously to form a uniform suspension.  Draw suspension into a syringe and administer 
through the G-tube port.  Repeat the transfer until the entire volume has been administered.  
Add small volume (40 mL) of sterile water to the container used to dissolve the tablets.  
Shake the residual suspension, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_342865] a syringe, and administer.  Repeat this last step 
to ensure the entire dose is administered.  The total volume of delivery/rinse is ~180 mL.  
 
Potential Drug Interaction : Erlotinib is highly protein bound (92% to 95% in humans).  Erlotinib 
is metabolized primarily via CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]1A2, and the pulmonary 
isoform CYP1A1.  Dose Erlotinib cautiously with agents that are highly protein bound or are 
metabolized by, or are inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes. 
 
Significant interactions with the clearance of other CYP3A4 substrates are unlikely. 
 
CYP Iso-Enzymes Inhibitors/Inducers: 
o Potent CYP3A4 or combined CYP3A4/CYP1A2 Inhibitors:  Use alternative drug.  
Alternatively, reduce Erlotinib dose in the event of drug interaction (if permitted by [CONTACT_12695]).  
o Potent CYP3A4 inducers:  Use alternative drug.  If an alternative treatment i s 
contraindicated, consider increasing the Erlotinib dose (if permitted by [CONTACT_760]).   
o Potent and moderate CYP1A2 inducers:  concomitant use with Erlotinib should be avoided. 
 
Food-drug interaction:  Avoid grapefruit /grapefruit juice (potent CYP3A4) while taking Erlotinib. 
 
Smoking:  Advise smokers to stop smoking while Erlotinib.  Smoking induces CYP1A2 enzymes 
and has been shown to reduce Erlotinib exposure by 50% to 60%. 
 
Anticoagulant:  Concomitant NSAIDs, warfarin or warfarin-derivatives may increase bleeding and 
PT /INR. Dose adjustment may be needed.  
 
Proton Pump Inhibitor:  Erlotinib’s solubility decreases as the pH increases. Co-administration of 
omeprazole with Erlotinib will increase the AUC and C max by 46% and 61%, respectively.  
 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, [ADDRESS_424627]: Avoid concomitant use of Erlotinib with gastric acid reducing agents if possible.  
When ranitidine 300 mg is given with Erlotinib, Erlotinib AUC and C max  decrease by 33% and 
54%, respectively.  Increasing the dose of Erlotinib will not compensate the loss of exposure.  
However, if an H 2-antagonist receptor is needed, take Erlotinib at least [ADDRESS_424628] administration.  Dosing such,  Erlotinib loss of exposure is 
minimized to AUC of 15% and C max   of 17%.   
 
Statins:   The combination of erlotinib and a statin may increase the potential for statin-induced 
myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, which was observed rarely. 
 
Patient Care Implications : If patient vomits after taking the tablets, readminister the dose only if 
the tablets can actually be seen and counted. 
 
Recommend patients to use sunscreen protection, and wear hat and long sleeve shirts as sunlight 
can exacerbate skin reactions. 
 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for one 
month after the last dose of Erlotinib. 
 
Availability  
 
Erlotinib is an investigational agent supplied to investigators by [CONTACT_131797] (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI). 
 
Erlotinib is provided to the NCI under a Clinical Trials Agreement (CTA) between Astellas

SAFETY PROFILE 
 
Adverse Events (AEs) Associated with Erlotinib  
 
A comprehensive list of AEs possibly related to Erlotinib is provided in the CAEPR.  Additional 
information can also be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  A few common or serious AEs are 
described below. 
 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Cases of ILD-like events, including fatalities, have been 
reported uncommonly in patients receiving OSI-774 for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), pancreatic cancer, or other advanced solid tumors.  In pi[INVESTIGATOR_342866] 21, in 
NSCLC, the incidence of serious ILD-like events was 0.8% in each of the placebo and OSI-774 
arms.  In the pancreatic cancer study in combination with gemcitabine, the incidence of ILD-like 
events was 2.5% in the OSI-774 plus gemcitabine group versus 0.4% in the placebo plus 
gemcitabine-treated group.  The overall incidence in patients treated with OSI-774 from all

Version Date: March 9, [ADDRESS_424629] of the cases were associated 
with confounding or contributing factors such as concomitant or prior chemotherapy, prior 
radiotherapy, pre-existing parenchymal lung disease, metastatic lung disease, or pulmonary 
infections.  In patients who develop acute onset of new and/or progressive unexplained 
pulmonary symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough and fever, OSI-774 therapy should be interrupted 
pending diagnostic evaluation.  If ILD is diagnosed, OSI-774 should be discontinued and 
appropriate treatment initiated as necessary. 
 
Rash
 or dermatosis:  Rash or dermatosis (grades 1-3) has been reported in many subjects 
(~50%) during the first several days of treatment, although severity diminishes after 4 weeks of 
therapy.  The use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450] ( i.e., diphenhydramine, corticosteroids) and oral antibiotics 
(tetracycline) has been instituted in some patients with variable results.  In patients with severe 
rash, treatment has been discontinued or the study drug dose reduced.  The etiology of the rash is 
still unknown, but may be related to the mechanism of action of OSI-774.  
 
Diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance:  Diarrhea has occurred in patients on OSI-
774, and moderate or severe diarrhea should be treated with loperamide.  In some cases, dose 
reduction may be necessary.  In the event of severe or persistent diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, or 
vomiting associated with dehydration, OSI-[ADDRESS_424630] been rare reports of hypokalemia 
and renal failure (including fatalities).  Some reports of renal failure were secondary to severe 
dehydration due to diarrhea, vomiting and/or anorexia while others were confounded by 
[CONTACT_342917].  In more severe or persistent cases of diarrhea, or cases leading to 
dehydration, particularly in groups of patients with aggravating risk factors (concomitant 
medications, symptoms or diseases or other predisposing conditions including advanced age), 
OSI-774 therapy should be interrupted and appropriate measures should be taken to intensively 
rehydrate the patients intravenously.  In addition, renal function and serum electrolytes including 
potassium should be monitored in patients at risk of dehydration. 
 
Hepatotoxicity with or without hepatic impairment: Hepatic failure and hepatorenal 
syndrome (including fatal cases) can occur with OSI-77 4 treatment in patients with normal 
hepatic function; the risk of hepatic toxicity is increased in patients with baseline hepatic 
impairment.  Perform periodic liver testing (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) 
during treatment with OSI-774.  Increased frequency of monitoring of liver function is required 
for
 patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction.  Withhold OSI-774 in 
patients without pre-existing hepatic impairment for total bilirubin levels >3 x institutional upper 
limit of normal (ULN) or transaminases >[ADDRESS_424631].  Withhold OSI-774 in patients with pre-
existing hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction for doubling of bilirubin or tripling of 
transaminases values over baseline.  Discontinue OSI-774 in patients whose abnormal liver tests 
meeting the above criteria do not improve significantly or resolve within three weeks. 
 
Renal insufficiencies:  Cases of hepatorenal syndrome, acute renal failure (including fatalities), 
and renal insufficiency have been reported.   Some were secondary to baseline hepatic 
impairment while others were associated with severe dehydration due to diarrhea, vomiting, 
and/or anorexia, or concurrent chemotherapy use.  In the event of dehydration, particularly in

should be taken to intensively rehydrate the patient.  Withhold OSI-774 in patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_342867].  Perform periodic monitoring of renal 
function and serum electrolytes during OSI-774 treatment. 
 
Gastrointestinal perforation:  Gastrointestinal perforation (including fatal cases) can occur with 
OSI-[ADDRESS_424632] prior history of peptic ulceration or 
diverticular disease may be at increased risk of perforation.  Permanently discontinue OSI-774 in 
patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. 
 
Bullous and exfoliative skin disorders: Bullous, blistering, and exfoliative skin conditions, 
including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], which in 
some cases were fatal, can occur with OSI-774 treatment.  Discontinue OSI-774 treatment if the 
patient develops severe bullous, blistering or exfoliating conditions. 
 
Myocardial infarction/ischemia: In the pancreatic carcinoma trial, six patients (incidence of 
2.1%) in the OSI-774/gemcitabine group developed myocardial infarction/ischemia.  One of 
these
 patients died due to myocardial infarction.  In comparison, three patients in the 
placebo/gemcitabine group developed myocardial infarction (incidence 1.1%), and one died due 
to 
myocardial infarction.  The pooled incidence of myocardial infarction/ischemia in the three 
monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.2% in the OSI-774 arms and 0.4% in the control arms. 
 
Ce
rebrovascular accident: In the pancreatic carcinoma trial, seven patients in the OSI-
774/gemcitabine group developed cerebrovascular accidents (incidence: 2.5%).  One of these 
wa
s hemorrhagic and was the only fatal event.  In comparison, in the placebo/gemcitabine group 
there were no cerebrovascular accidents.  The pooled incidence of cerebrovascular accident in 
the three monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.6% in the OSI-774 arms and 0.9% in the 
control arms. 
 
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia: The pooled incidence of 
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the three monotherapy lung 
cancer studies was 0% in the OSI-774 arms and 0.1% in the control arms.  The incidence of 
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the pancreatic cancer study was 
1.4% in the OSI-774 plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm.

8.1.2 ONALE SPIB (AT13387) (NSC 749712) 
 
Ch
emical Name: ( 2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl)- [5-(4-methyl-pi[INVESTIGATOR_9482]-1-ylmethyl)- 1,3- 
dihydro-isoindol-2-yl]-methanone,  L-lactic acid salt 
 
Other Name: [CONTACT_50182]13387AU, Onalespib 
 
Classification:      Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor  
 
Molecular Formula:   C24H31N3O3.C3H6O3   M.W.:  499.61  
 
Mode of Action :  AT13387 is a synthetic non-ansamycin small molecule that inhibits heat shock 
protein 90 (HSP90.  HSP90 seems to affect multiple aberrant signaling pathways and therefore 
may be of clinical benefit in several cancer treatments.  
  
How
 Supplied:  AT13387 is supplied by [CONTACT_342918]. and distributed by [CONTACT_472], 
NC
I as a 265 mg free base equivalent (L-lactic acid salt) vial, containing white to off-white 
lyophilized powder.  The agent is formulated in  pH 5.0 (red cap ). 
 
P
reparation:  Reconstitute the 265-mg lyophilized powder with 10 mL of Sterile Water for 
Inje
ction (SWFI) resulting in 25.7 mg/mL concentration (10.3 mL total volume).  A sticky mass 
will be formed. Vigorously shake the vial. Agitate until the contents are fully dissolved (about 5 
minutes).  Leave the diluted vial at ambient temperature for 15-30 minutes to allow any foam to 
dissipate. If not used immediately, store the reconstituted vial(s) at 20 to 80 C not to exceed 8 
hours. 
 
Withdraw the calculated dose of AT13387 and further dilute it in 250 mL of D5W or 0.9% NS. 
The prepared IV solution is compatible in PVC or non-PVC infusion bags.   
 
Store the prepared IV solution at [ADDRESS_424635]
ete. Protection from light during the infusion period is not required.   
 
Storage:     Store the intact vials at 150 to 25ºC (59 to 77ºF).  Protect from light. 
 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return AT13387 to 150 to 25ºC (59 to 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
61 77ºF
) and quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including 
documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to 
[EMAIL_087]  for determination of suitability. 
 
Stability:     Shelf life surveillance of the intact vials is ongoing .  
Route  of Administration:      Intravenous  
 
Method of Administration :  Infuse over 1 hour through a central line or a well-defined peripheral 
vein (Note: an in-line filter is NOT required).  If use a peripheral line, be sure to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_342868].  Check the infusion site every 15 minutes. Change infusion site 
should evidence of swelling or discoloration is observed.   
 
Potential Drug Interactions:   AT13387 is a substrate of UGT with a relatively low affinity for 
UGT isoforms. In vitro data demonstrate that AT13387 is a weak inhibitor of UGT1A1, UGT1A3 
and UGT1A9.    AT13387 is also a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -3A4, -2D6, -2C9 and -2C19.  
AT13387 appears to metabolize via the glucuronidation, sulphation and N-oxidation. 
 
Pre-clinical studies suggest that AT13387 is a substrate of P-gp, the efflux ratios was above 2 
(ranging from 3.4 to 4.6); a moderate inhibitor of BCRP (35.9% +/- 2%, p=0.0001) and P- gp 
(31.3% +/- 1.2%, p= 0.0009), and a strong inhibitor of MATE1 (94.6% +/- 0.2%, p=0.0001) and 
MATE2-K (91.2% +/- 1.2%, p= 0.0002). 
 
Patient Care Implications:  There are no genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, developmental and 
reproductive studies conducted with AT13387.  Women of childbearing potential should not 
become pregnant or breastfeed and men should not father a child during the study.  All subjects 
must use acceptable contraceptive measures during the treatment of AT13387 and [ADDRESS_424636] dose of the investigational drug. 
 
Systemic infusion reactions (e.g., vomiting, itching skin, or swelling), slow the infusion and/or 
administer NS or D5W through a “Y” connector in parallel to AT13387 IV infusion.  Pre-
medication (e.g., dexamethasone, H-[ADDRESS_424637]) may be given before subsequent 
infusions and/or administer additional volume of 500 mL over 1 hour if medically appropriate.   
 
Avoid extravasation. For local irritation, apply cold compress or topi[INVESTIGATOR_342869].

or the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated for response every 8 weeks. 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. 
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_424653] their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  
Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be 
considered evaluable.) 
 
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response.  Patients who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non-target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.

by [CONTACT_13190] x-ray or as ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by [CONTACT_461].  
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters). 
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, [ADDRESS_424655] be ≥15 mm (≥1.5 cm) in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan 
sli
ce thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm [0.5 cm]).  At baseline and in 
follow
-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm [<1 cm] or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm [≥1 
to 
<1.5 cm] short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomening
eal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by 
[CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable. 
 
Note
:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions. 
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used 
as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease. 
 
Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
 
11.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
76 c
alipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment. 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) diameter 
as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
b
y color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.  
 
Chest x-ray   Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5 cm) or less.  If CT 
scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm (0.5 cm), the minimum size for a 
mea
surable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain 
situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use
 of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 
PET- CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) , 
then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, [ADDRESS_424656] in selected instances. 
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published 
[J
NCI 96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 
2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_424657]-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 
C
ytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
t
ypes, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease. 
 
FDG-PET   While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If the positive FDG-
PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this 
is not PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, [ADDRESS_424658] be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm (<1 cm). 
 
P
artial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm).  
(N
ote:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm 
[<1 cm] short axis). 
 
Note
:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non-PD:   Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.

Investigator). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the firs t 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met

Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
85 This 
is a phase 1 /2 trial of Onalespib in combination with erlotinib.  The initial segment of the 
trial 
will attempt to escalate the starting dose of onalespib, in two steps, when given in 
combination with a fixed dose of erlotinib.  The primary endpoint during dose escalation is dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT), as defined in Section 5.2.  Dose escalation will follow a 3+[ADDRESS_424671] either receive an 
informative treatment (as defined in Sections 5.2 and 5.3) or experience DLT to be informative 
about dose escalation decisions.   
 
When the phase 2 dose has been established, recruitment into Phase 2 cohorts A and B will begin 
sim
ultaneously.  Cohort A will enroll patients with EGFR activating mutations (specified above) 
who have begun erlotinib within the previous 6 months (180 days), and have been evaluated, but 
without achieving a partial or complete response as defined by [CONTACT_342925] [ADDRESS_424672] criteria, and each cohort will be independently governed by [CONTACT_52254]’s two-
stage minimax design, implemented to distinguish a 25% response rate from an assumed 
background rate of 5%, with 10% type I and type II error rates.  For each phase 2 cohort, the 
ini
tial stage will enroll 13 subjects, continuing if one or more respond.  The target total accrual in 
each cohort will be 20 subjects, with 3 responses considered encouraging for further 
development in the relevant class of patients.    
 
13.2 S ample Size/Accrual Rate 
 
The phase [ADDRESS_424673]-
case scenario requiring 24 informative subjects.  The Phase 2 segment is expected to require 40 
subjects (20 per cohort) but could stop for futility with 26 total subjects.  The target sample size 
is thus 46,  allowing for 6 subjects from phase 1 at the RP2D to be included in one or the other 
P
hase 2 cohort.   The likely range of sample size is from 32 to 52.

13.3 Stratification Factors 
 
Eligible patients will be classified in one of two possible strata: (A) patients with EGFR 
activating mutations who have been treated with erlotinib; or (B) patients will metastatic or 
recurrent NSCLC that harbor an EGFR exon [ADDRESS_424674] to the Simon’s two-stage design, including any relevant 
patients from phase 1, of the same stratum, treated at the RP2D.  If there is a response at a lower 
dose,
 the report will be supplemented with isotonic regression estimates.   Because stratum A 
includes subjects who have progressed on erlotinib, as well as subjects who have neither 
progressed nor responded after at least 12 weeks on erlotinib, results for these two groups will be 
reported separately as a secondary data summary.   A significant difference (two-sided 0.10 level) 
in response rates is not expected, but it would imply a significant number of responses in at least 
one sub-group, and any response after progression on erlotinib would be an interesting finding. 
 
PFS is a secondary endpoint, and will be summarized for stratum B as time from first protocol 
treatment, using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) estimator.   For stratum A, the product- limit 
estimate of PFS will be calculated separately for second-line patients, who have progressed on 
erlotinib.  For patients in stratum A who have not yet progressed on erlotinib, the time on pre-
protocol erlotinib and PFS on protocol therapy will be displayed as event time-lines, and any 
Kaplan-Meyer plot using the combined data for stratum A will use left truncation, to avoid 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, [ADDRESS_424675] be assessed for response to treatment, even if there 
are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be 
assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) 
stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early 
death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 8) unknown (not assessable, 
insuff
icient data).   
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria and received no study medication will 
be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  Patients in response categories 4-[ADDRESS_424676] a treatment failure (analyzed as if disease progression).  Thus, 
an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from 
the analysis of the response rate.  
 
Phase [ADDRESS_424677] been identified ( e.g., early death due to other 
re
asons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, 
these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning 
treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be 
clearly reported.  The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided.  
 
Analysis of tissue and plasma biomarkers are exploratory in nature, constrained by [CONTACT_342926] a phase 1/[ADDRESS_424678] 
response and summarized with changes in tumor measurements.  Strong association 
between loss of marker signal (including plasma EGFR-T790M) and response may 
provide preliminary indication of potential as a predictive marker.   Emergent markers 
will
 be similarly evaluated as potential predictors of treatment resistance, and the 
mutation profile of responding patients will be examined informally for repeating 
patterns.  Multiple xed immunofluorescence in paired tumor biopsies will be used to 
demonstrate the knockdown of Hsp90 client oncoproteins.  Analysis will similarly 
involve association of knockdown and tumor response or measurements.   Biopsies are 
optional. Because any observation of target knock-down is an informative observation, 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
88 biops
ies will continue to be sought, even if the initial rate of consent to biopsies is low. If 
zero out of 6 on-treatment biopsies show target knock-down, the upper 80% confidence 
bound would be below 25%, and hence inconsistent with the target response rate under 
assumed mechanisms. We thus regard [ADDRESS_424679] zero out of 6 
biopsies will prompt a re-evaluation of performing on-target biopsies in additional 
patients enrolled on trial. 
 
14. CC C POLICIES FOR MONITORING CONSORTIUM TRIALS 
 
This protocol is monitored at several levels, as described in this section.  To summarize:  The 
trial 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_25493].  The CCC Data Coordinating Center reviews accrual 
a
nd toxicities monthly.  An external, independent DSMC reviews the study progress twice 
yearly.  In addition, for the Phase [ADDRESS_424680] monthly - and as needed - 
conference calls with study investigators to review accrual, progress, and any unforeseen 
issues.  Dose escalation/expansion/de-escalation decisions require sign-off by [CONTACT_9154] (or his 
or
 her designee) and study statistician (or his or her designee).  During the Phase [ADDRESS_424681] quarterly - and as needed - conference calls with study investigators to review 
accrual, progress, and any unforeseen issues.  Decisions to proceed to the second stage of the 
Pha
se 2 trial will require sign-off by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_1238] (the trial statistician). 
 
The protocol principal investigator (PI) is responsible for monitoring the conduct and progress of 
this Phase 2 trial, including the ongoing review of accrual, data and toxicities, as well as the 
accumulation of reported adverse events from other trials testing the same drug(s).  The 
participating clinicians and their designees are responsible for timely submission of adverse 
event reports (see Section 7.0 ) and electronic case report forms.  The Data Coordinating Center 
for the CCC Consortium is responsible for providing the PI [INVESTIGATOR_342883] a timely fashion.   Although the PI [INVESTIGATOR_342884], it is the Data Coordinating Center of the CCC that distributes all 
submitted SAE reports to the appropriate individuals, including the local protocol principal 
investigators, at each of the participating institutions.   
 
The Data Coordinating Center posts a summary (accrual, toxicities, and responses) of each CCC 
initiated trial on the CCC website.  In this way, each PI [INVESTIGATOR_25499]- to-date information on 
the status of his or her trial.  In consultation with the collaborating statistician, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_342885]: 
 
(a) for Phase 1 trials, all dose limiting toxicities and decisions regarding dose escalation, 
e
xpansion, as well as decisions to terminate escalation, and  
(b) for Phase 2 trials, the toxicities and therapeutic endpoints referred to in the statistical 
plan. 
 
The Data Coordinating Committee meets monthly to review data management and data quality 
issues –  completeness of data submissions as well as accuracy in terms of built-in, computerized 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, [ADDRESS_424682] of CCC trials occurs at several level s: 
 
1. The  Data Coordinating Center for the CCC flags all trials that are approaching a decision 
in terms of toxicity (for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials) or responses (for Phase 2 trials).  
De
cisions are made by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_25501], and are 
communicated to the participating centers by [CONTACT_25551]. At the 
monthly teleconferences, the accrual of each open protocol is reviewed. 
 
2. F or CTEP sponsored Phase 1  trials, data are reported to the NCI-designated clinical trials 
monitoring service (CTMS) which will audit patients’ records on each protocol – at each 
C
CC institution; this audit is initiated by [CONTACT_472].   
 
3. An independent CCC DSMC will review CCC trials every [ADDRESS_424683] of 6 voting members (3 medical oncologists or hematologists involved in Phase 
1/2
 cancer clinical trials but not participating in CCC studies, a patient representative and 
a statistician) and a non-voting CCC statistician.   
 
a. DSMC meetings will take place twice a year.  Additional meetings will be convened if 
necessary.  
b. This DSMC will review each CCC trial in terms of accrual, toxicity/safety, and 
adherence to trial design, audit results, and likelihood of successful completion.   
c. The DSMC will report to the CCC leadership.

Information for Patients, Their Caregivers, and Non-Study Healthcare Team on Possible 
In
teractions with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements  
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the 
experimental study drugs AT13887 and Erlotinib .  This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_104429] 
C
ancer Institute.  This form is addressed to the patient, but includes important information for 
others who care for this patient.  
 
These are the things that you as a healthcare provider need to know: 
  
Er
lotinib interacts with a c ertain specific enzyme in your liver.  
 
 The  enzyme in question is CYP3A4 and erlotinib  is broken down by [CONTACT_342927] . 
 
To the patient: Take this paper with you to your medical appointments and keep the 
at
tached information card in your wallet .   
 
Erlotinib and/or onalespib may interact with other drugs which can cause side effects. For this 
re
ason, it is very important to tell your study doctors of any medicines you are taking before you 
enroll onto this clinical trial.  It is also very important to tell your doctors if you stop taking any 
regular medicines, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When 
you talk about your current medications with your doctors, include medicine you buy without a 
prescription (over-the-counter remedy), or any herbal supplements such as St. John’s Wort.  It is 
helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated medication list with you. 
 
Many health care providers can write prescriptions.  You must tell all of your health care 
providers (doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists) you are taking part in a 
c
linical trial.  
 
These are the things that you and they need to know:  
 
Erlotinib  must be used very carefully with other medicines that use certain CYP3A4 to be 
effective or to be cleared from your system . Before you enroll onto the clinical trial, your study 
doctor will work with your regular health care providers  to review any medicines and herbal 
supplements  that are considered str ong inducers of CYP3A4.  
 
 P lease be very careful!  Over-the-counter drugs (including herbal supplements) may 
contain ingredients that could interact with your study drug.  Speak to your doctors or 
pharmacist to determine if there could be any side effects.  
 I f you take acetaminophen regularly: You should not take more than 4 grams a day if you 
are an adult or 2.4 grams a day if you are older than 65 years of age. Read labels 
carefully! Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines for pain, flu, and cold. 
NCI Protocol #:9878 
Version Date: March 9, 2018 
 
94  Your  prescribers should look at this web site 
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugIn
teractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm  or consult a medical reference to see if any medicine 
they want to prescribe is on a list of drugs to avoid. 
 I f you drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit or Seville oranges: Avoid these until the study 
is over.  
 Do not take omeprazole (also known as Prilosec) for heartburn or for stomach reflux.  Talk 
to your doctor or pharmacist before taking it. 
 If use ranitidine, cimetidine, or famotidine for heartburn, erlotinib must be taken [ADDRESS_424686]. 
 I f use antacids, take the antacid dose several hours from erlotinib dose.

You are enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental study  
drug s erlotinib and AT13387 (Onalespib lactate).  This clinical trial is 
sponsored by [CONTACT_6812].  Erlotinib and AT13387 (Onalespib lactate). may 
interact with drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_6813] .  Because of this, 
it is very important to:  
 Tell your doctors if you stop taking any medicine s or if you start 
taking a ny new medicine s. 
 Tell all of your health care providers  (doctor s, physician assistant s, 
nurse practitioner s, or pharmacist s) that you are taking part in a 
clinical trial.  
 Check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use 
an over -the-counter medicine or herbal s upplement.  
 
  
 Erlotinib  interacts with a specific liver enzyme called CYP 3A4 and 
must be used very carefully with other medicines that interact with 
CYP3A4.   
 Before you enroll onto the clinical trial, your study doctor will 
work with your regular health care providers to review any 
medicines  and herbal supplements that are considered strong 
inducers/inhibitors of CYP 3A4.  
 Before prescribing new medicines, your regular health care 
providers should go to a frequently -updated medical reference  for 
a list of drugs to avoid, or contact [CONTACT_6814].

Title: A Phase 1/[ADDRESS_424689] 3 ml blood in heparinized (green top) tube. Start 
prior to Onalespib dosing on cycle 1, day 8. Blood specimens (3 mL whole blood collected in 
he
parinized tubes ( Li) sufficient to provide a minimum of 1 mL of plasma) for PK will be 
collected from patients on day C1D8 of Onalespib administration. The timing of start of onalespib 
infusion s
hould be within 30 min of erlotinib intake on that day (timing of both erlotinib intake 
and start of Onalespib infusion should be recorded). 
 
Handling of Specimen 
1. Obtain at least 3 mL of blood into Lithium Heparin (Green Top) Vacutainer tube. Allow 
enough time for the tube to fill sufficiently. 
2. Gently invert the tube for [ADDRESS_424690] blood roller for a minimum of 5 minutes. If a blood roller is not 
available continue to invert the tube further 8-10 times.  
4. Centrifuge the tube at 1100 - 1500g for 10-15 minutes at 4-8°C within 1 hour of sample 
c
ollection.  
5. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_342878] (using the pi[INVESTIGATOR_342879])  
6. Introduce roughly equal proportions of the plasma into the 2 (primary and secondary) cryovial 
tubes (size 2 mL).  
7. Discard the Lithium Heparin tube per your local policy. 
8. Freeze the 2 aliquots of plasma at -70°C or less until shipment to the bioanalytical lab 
(instructed by [CONTACT_342909]).

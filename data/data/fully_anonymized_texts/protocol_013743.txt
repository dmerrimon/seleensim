  PURPOSE  
The purpose of this exploratory investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an investigational 
version of the Cutera enlighten ™ laser for skin rejuvenation, specifically improvement of acne scars, fine 
rhytides, lentigines,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], erythema and skin texture. The version of the laser under investigation 
allows the user to treat using a wavelength between 660 nm – [ADDRESS_1258380] a variety of options for non-invasive skin 
rejuvenation, from laser and light-based treatments to devices that utilize ultrasound and radiofrequency, 
however this was not always the case. Initial skin rejuvenation procedures utilized ablative lasers, such as 
the carbon dioxide (CO 2) and erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG), and resulted in substantial 
improvement in skin appearance, texture, rhytides and laxity[ 1-3]. Since ablative treatments destroy the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_482430], ample post-procedure 
recovery time is required and patients may experience side effects lasting for a few weeks. Furthermore, 
hypo- or hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], prolonged wound healing and even scarring can occur following ablative 
procedures [ 4-6]. Treatment methods with less risk of side effects and post-treatment down time are in 
high demand. As such, the choices are vast and varied, ranging from non-ablative laser devices to those 
that use radiofrequency [ 7-15].  
 
Laser therapy often includes the use of pulsed lasers, namely Q-Switched or Quality-Switched (QS) lasers 
which produce nanosecond laser pulses by [CONTACT_237139]-state energy from the 
laser medium [16]. This concept is based on the principle of selective photothermolysis which imply: (1) 
the use of the wavelength matching the absorption spectra of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517]; and (2) the delivery of the 
heat to target pi[INVESTIGATOR_237117] [ 17].  This 
allows selective destruction of target chromophore in the skin with minimal damage to the surrounding 
tissue. 
 
Nanosecond QS lasers have been widely used for more than 20 years as a safe and effective treatment for skin 
rejuvenation [18- 24]. Laser wavelengths and pulse durations currently available for nanosecond QS laser 
treatment of pi[INVESTIGATOR_897703] 532 nm Nd:YAG, 1064 nm Nd:YAG, 755 nm Alexandrite and 694 nm 
Ruby [CONTACT_897708] 5 to 10 ns (Nd:YAG), 50 to 70 ns (Alexandrite) 25 to 30 ns (Ruby). These 
wavelengths in the visible and infrared ranges are appropriate for the absorption spectrum of melanin. 
Melanin, the target pi[INVESTIGATOR_897704], is largely present in basal keratinocytes in benign pi[INVESTIGATOR_290391]. During laser procedures, the melanosomes, the organelle which hold the melanin in melanocytes, are 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_897705] [25, 26]. This rapid heating and evaporation of the melanosomes in the skin result in 
vacuolization.  
 
The current proposed exploratory clinical study described herein intends to evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of the investigational laser and the optimal range of treatment parameters for use in skin 
rejuvenation.

4.4 Study Safety Assessments  
4.4.1 Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events: 
Following the first laser treatment, adverse device effects (ADEs) will be assessed post-treatment and at 
each subsequent subject visit using the following scale:

1= mild: requires minimal or no treatment and does not interfere with the Subject’s daily activities.  
2= moderate: may cause some interference with functioning.  
3= severe: interrupts Subject’s usual daily activity and may require treatment. 
4.4.2 Treatment-related Discomfort 
After each laser treatment, subjects will be asked to rate the average amount of discomfort experienced 
during treatment and immediately after laser treatment.    
4.4.3 Phone Follow- up 
Phone follow- up will be conducted for all subjects by [CONTACT_737]’s staff at [ADDRESS_1258384]’s treatment area at baseline, prior to all 
laser treatments and at each follow-up. Any jewelry will be removed from the area being photographed. 
For facial photographs, hair will be pulled away from the face with a headband and subject will have 
recently cleansed skin. Photographs will be taken prior to all laser treatments and at each follow-up visit. 
Facial photographs will be obtained from 3 angles: with the subject facing forward, 90° to the right and 
90° to the left. Photographs will be taken in the same windowless room equipped with adequate lighting. 
The room lighting, camera positioning and subject positioning should be consistent for all study visit 
photographs. Digital camera settings should remain the same for all photographs and the highest 
resolution settings should be utilized.  
4.6 Study Discontinuation 
Cutera, Inc. (the sponsor) has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the 
study  may include, but are not limited to, the following: incidence or severity of adverse events in this or 
other studies indicates a potential health hazard to subjects; subject enrollment is unsatisfactory; number 
of protocol deviations is unacceptable; data recording is inaccurate or incomplete; or questionable study 
site compliance with ICH-E6, Good Clinical Practice.  
4.7 Investigator Selection 
The Investigator will be invited to participate in the study based on his or her medical specialty, experience 
conducting clinical research studies and experience in the use of light-based devices for aesthetic 
indications. Access to potential study subjects and the Investigator’s since re interest in this study along 
with expressed willingness to cooperate with the study process and requirements was also considered.

This is an exploratory study to evaluate safety and efficacy of the investigational enlighten device, 
therefore, formal statistical analyses are not planned.   
 
Outcome measures will be assessed around multiple endpoints.  These measures will be: degree of 
improvement as assessed by [CONTACT_737],  and safety. Additional assessments 
may also be performed but are not considered part of the analysis (i.e. subject post-treatment 
questionnaire).  The specific assessment tools, collection method and time points are listed herein.

Missing data will not be imputed for efficacy or safety endpoints. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Efficacy Analyses 
Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median and range will be performed for: 
 
 The degree of improvement at [ADDRESS_1258395]-final treatment as assessed by [CONTACT_737], using 
the Physician’s Global Assessment tool . 
  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Safety Analyses 
The safety variables for this study are: 
 
 Incidence and severity of adverse effects during study duration (to be displayed descriptively as 
counts and frequency distributions)  
 Subject discomfort (pain) during treatment (to be descriptively displayed). 
 
Enrolled subjects who received at least one treatment will be included in the safety analyses. Device-
related and procedu re-related adverse effects (AEs) and subjects who prematurely terminate from the 
study due to an adverse device effect, including the treatment-related pain ratings, as reported on case 
report forms will be tabulated and analyzed. For a given AE term, counting will be done by [CONTACT_1130], not by 
[CONTACT_15992], i.e. for a subject reporting the same AE more than once, the event will be counted only once, at the 
most severe and most-related occurrence.  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing each AE 
Term will be descriptively summarized. Statistical hypothesis testing will not be performed for safety data.

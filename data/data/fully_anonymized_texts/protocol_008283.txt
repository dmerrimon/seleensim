 STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  We will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate treatment 
effects on repeated study outcomes. Primary analyses will be by [CONTACT_7586] -
to-treat, without regard to adherence to treatment. In our prior trials, we had 
excellent retention and visit adherence. Nonetheless, in this high -risk 
population, missing data may be encountered.123, [ADDRESS_581690] 
sensitivity analyses imputing all missing urine samples as positive, adjusting 
for baseline correlates of missingness, and using i nverse probability of 
censoring weights.125  
Specific Aim 1:  To determine the efficacy of targeted naltrexone versus 
placebo in reducing binge drinking among non -dependent MSM , as 
determined by [CONTACT_454946] -back 
(TLFB), by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. GEE Poisson models with robust standard errors will be 
used to assess reductions on weekly drinking outcomes . Baseline TLFB 
results will be included in the analysis.   Minimum detectable effects 
(MDEs):  In calculating minimum detectable effects, we hypothesized on 
pharmacologic grounds that oral naltrexone will reach full efficacy against 
alcohol use almost immediately; accordingly we expect treatment -control 
differences to be approximately constant over the 12 weeks of the trial. 
Based on the prior trial (93% retention), we estimate that 90% of 
participants will be retained at [ADDRESS_581691] 80% power in 2- sided tests with a type -I 
error rate of 5% to detect 27% reductions in numbers of binge drinking 
occasions, as well as 10% r eductions in the average numbers of drinks on 
drinking days.   Specific Aim 2:  To determine the efficacy of targeted 
naltrexone versus placebo in reducing alcohol consumption among non-
dependent MSM , as determined by [CONTACT_454947] (Et G) 
positive urines, by [INVESTIGATOR_216].  GEE logistic models with robust standard errors 
will be used to assess reductions frequency of positive urine tests, 
accounting for within- subject correlation.   MDEs : Using the assumptions 
for loss to follow -up for Aim 1, as w ell as estimates based on biomarker  data 
from Batki et al’s study on Topi[INVESTIGATOR_454900]122 for the 
within -subject correlation and cont rol group urine positivity rate, we 
estimate that the study will have 80% power in 2 -sided tests with a type -I 
error rate of 5% to detect 15 -23% reductions in the urine positivity rate in 
the treatment arm.   Specific Aim 3:   To determine the efficacy of t argeted 
naltrexone versus placebo in reducing alcohol -associated sexual risk 
behaviors , we will use GEE Poisson models with robust standard errors for 
the four monthly ACASI assessments on numbers of male anal sex partners, HIV-serodiscordant unprotected anal sex partners, unprotected anal sex 
partners while intoxicated with alcohol, and unprotected anal sex events with serodiscordant partners, including the baseline value. In the event that 
these outcomes are severely over -dispersed, we will analyze indica tors for 
any self -report of each behavior, using GEE logistic models.   
MDEs : Based 
on estimates of within -subject correlation and control prevalence from our 
Project Echo trial, we estimate that the study will have 80% power to detect 
31% reductions in numbers of male anal sex partners, 57% reductions in 
SDUA partners, 46% reductions in UA partners while intoxicated with 
alcohol, and 56% reductions in UA events with serodiscordant partners. In 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_454897], Glenn- Milo  Confidential  
 
[ADDRESS_581692] 80% power to d etect 
reductions of 14%, 38%, 39%, and 30% in any report of these four sexual 
risk behaviors, respectively.    
Rationale for Number 
of Subjects  Given our estimate that there are 48,070 binge -drinking MSM in San 
Francisco19, 20 and our prior trial enrollment rates, we are confident that we 
will be able to recruit 120 eligible non -dependent, binge -drinking MSM for 
the proposed trial.

[ADDRESS_581693] sex with men (MSM) at high-
risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV. In the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) 
survey, 84% of MSM consumed alcohol in the past 30 days, and 57% reported at least one 
occasion of binge drinkin g.[ADDRESS_581694].15-17 In San Francisco, 72% and 
55% of MSM reported binge drinking in the past [ADDRESS_581695] prevalent exposure attributed to HIV infections among MSM  
and it is estimated that there are 48,070 binge -drinking MSM in San Francisco.19, 20 MSM are 
disproportionately impacted by [CONTACT_10840] , accounting for 61% of ne w infections in 2009.21 For San 
Francisco MSM, HIV prevalence is estimated at 22.7% and HIV annual incidence is estimated at 
1.27% per year.22 It is imperative to develop more evidence- based HIV -prevention interventions 
that are not only efficacious, but also feasible and acceptable to MSM.   
 Binge and other heavy drinking patterns are associated with HIV risk behaviors.  
NHBS data show that  alcohol use before or during unprotected sex was common for MSM —41% 
and 43% of alcohol drinkers surveyed reported unprotected insertive and unprotected receptive 
anal sex while intoxicated on alcohol, respectively, during their most recent sexual epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].[ADDRESS_581696] randomized controlled trials of MSM in the US, 40% 
of current drinkers reported having unprotected sex while intoxicated during their most recent anal 
sex epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].[ADDRESS_581697] 
unprotecte d intercourse, certain risk contexts are more consistently associated with alcohol use.4, 24 
The acute effects of alcohol consumption (e.g., altered cognition, impaired judgment and increased sexual desire and conf idence) may contribute to risk -taking behaviors.
25-28 A myriad of 
psychosocial factors (e.g., cognitive escape, impulsivity, expectancies) are believed to mediate the 
association between alcohol and sexual risk beh aviors.26, 29- [ADDRESS_581698] precise temporal link between these 
two behaviors and provide stronger evidence for causality.5, 24 Binge drinking and other patterns of 
heavy alcohol use are independently associated with a variety of high -risk behaviors in MSM, 
including unprotected anal sex, multiple partners, and having HIV -serodiscordant partners17, 35- 44—
a link also observed among black, Na tive American, and older MSM.45-47 Binge -drinking and 
heavy alcohol consumption are major causes of incident HIV infections in MSM. Binge 
alcohol use was independently associated with a greater than three -fold incr ease in odds for new 
HIV diagnoses among MSM who had a previously (past 12 months) negative HIV -test in a case-
control study.48 In the Explore study of 4,295 HIV -negative MSM from six metropolitan areas, 
29% of HIV incidence was attributable to use of alcohol or other drugs before sex; 6.1% was 
attributable to heavy alcohol use.[ADDRESS_581699] for seroconversion among heavy drinkers was 61% greater, compared 
to those who abstained from alcohol du ring the 24 year follow -up (1984- 2008).49

 Figure 1: Hypothesized mechanism of action for naltrexone   Behavioral interventions to address binge drinking to date have failed to reach 
MSM. Novel interventions are needed for MSM who binge drink.[ADDRESS_581700] 
been shown to reduce heavy alcohol use among MSM. However, only 20% of MSM who use alcohol or non- injection drugs have ever participated in alcohol or drug treatment programs.
3 In 
San Francisco, only 16% of binge -drinking MSM have sought alcohol treatment, underscoring the 
need for novel alcohol interventions.[ADDRESS_581701] shown that reductions in substance use can r esult in parallel reductions in HIV -sexual 
risk behaviors among MSM not seeking treatment.
53, 54 A pharmacologic intervention for binge 
drinking may lead to an analogous parallel reduction in alcohol -related sexual  risks. A critical 
challenge for HIV prevention interventions with MSM is the lack of interventions that reach 
MSM and effectively address HIV risk conferred through unprotected sex for MSM who 
binge drink.  
  
 Naltrexone is an efficacious and 
effective ph armacologic treatment for 
alcohol dependence that blocks the reinforcing positive effects of alcohol use. Alcohol consumption results in the 
release of β-endorphins that bind and 
activate μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328].
55 Naltrexone 
competitively blocks β -endorphins from 
activating μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328]56 in the 
nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental 
area, which mediate dopamine release 
(Figure 1 , adapted from 57). Thus, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_454901],
58, 59 tempering the positive neurobiological effects of alcohol.56, 60 
Naltrexone is effective in attenuating the positive subjective effects of alcohol intoxication —
including quality of “high”, craving,  and euphoria, supporting its efficacy among current 
drinkers.61-65 A two -year longitudinal study of “heavy social drinkers” who habitually binge drink 
found that the positive subjective and stimulant effects of al cohol are strong predictors of 
sustained and increased binge drinking.66 Given naltrexone’s efficacy in reducing the positive 
effects of alcohol t hat have been linked to future binge drinking,66 naltrexone may be a 
promising option to reduce binge drinking.  Naltrexone is well -tolerated by [CONTACT_454948].56, 67- 70 Naltrexone has few serious side 
effects, no known abuse potential, 68, 69, 71- 74 and no known sexual side effects.71 
 Naltrexone’s pharmacokinetic properties support ta rgeted administration (i.e., use in 
anticipation of heavy alcohol use on an “as needed” basis).  Naltrexone’s activity is believed to be 
due to both the parent and the 6- β-naltrexol metabolite.71 Naltrexone reaches peak plasma levels 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_454897], Glenn- Milo  Confidential  
 
12 
 within one hour of oral administration. The mean elimination half -life for naltrexone and 6- β-
naltrexol are four and 13 hours, respectively.71 Naltrexone also has high affinity to the μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_162223] (Ki = 2.5 ± 0.21 nM) and a single 50 mg dose can block μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_454902] 72 
hours75 raising the possibility that dosing even 1 -2 days prior to anticipated alcohol consumption 
may be effective. Targeted administration of naltrexone on an “as needed” basis has shown 
promise in reducing heavy drinking among heteros exuals. Targeted naltrexone dosing was 
feasible and acceptable in a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_454903] -drinking young adults not ready or willing 
to abstain from alcohol; the trial completion and targeted medication adherence rates were 93% 
and 83%, respectively.[ADDRESS_581702] also been 
successfully recruited and retained in targeted dosing studies.11, 77- 79 Targeted naltrexone 
administered aft er a period of daily dosing significantly reduced heavy- drinking relapse.80 
Similarly, in a trial conducted by [CONTACT_237731], et al., men assigned to targeted naltrexone showed 
significant reductions in mean drinks per day, and in number of drinks during drinking days, 
compared to those assigned to daily  naltrexone administration, daily  placebo, or targeted 
placebo.11 Intermittent dosing schedules for opi[INVESTIGATOR_454904]: targeted nalmefene reduced heavy drinking days, “very heavy” drinking days, and number 
of drinks during  drinking days in randomized controlled trials.81, [ADDRESS_581703] 
evaluated sexual risk behaviors or exclusively recruited binge drinking MSM at risk for acquiring 
or transmitting HIV. Questions abou t the efficacy of targeted naltrexone to reduce alcohol -
related sexual risk behavior remain unanswered;  no efficacy trial has determined if targeted 
use of pharmacologic agents for binge drinking can reduce HIV risk behavior.

medication to reduce alcohol consumption is feasible and acceptable among binge -drinking MSM. 
If targeted dosing is efficacious among binge -drinking MSM, it may ultimately expand strategies 
for MSM to reduce their alcohol consumption.  
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
Adverse drug effects: A primary risk of participation in this study is the  potential of AEs due to  
taking naltrexone. These risks are seen as reasonable, given the favorable side effect profile for  
this medication and the fact that we will exclude persons from the trial who are at higher risk for  
AEs. As part of the informed con sent process, participants will be informed of the potential risks 
of taking naltrexone.

 Naltrexone is well -tolerated and has no known significant drug interactions.54In 
randomized controlled trials, naltrexone has few serious side effects; it has no known  abuse  
potential and dependence has not been reported.54, 66, 67, 69- 72.  Naltrexone’s activity is believed to  be 
due to both the parent compound and the 6- naltrexol metabolite.[ADDRESS_581706] safety study to date on clinical use of  
naltrexone as a pharmacotherapy for treatment of alcoholism was a multi -center safety trial  
involving 865 individuals (500 naltrexone -treated patients, 238 patients in an unmedicated  
control group).68. Results of this study demonstrated that the most co mmonly reported side effects  
were nausea (9.8%), headache (6.6%), dizziness (4.4%), nervousness (3.8%), and fatigue  
(3.6%); serious side effects were uncommon. 68.  Naltrexone was discontinued in 15% of the  
participants, with nausea being the most common r eason for medication discontinuation. 68. Studies 
in alcoholic populations and healthy volunteers have suggested that a small number of patients  
may experience an opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351] -like symptom complex including tearfulness, mild nausea,  
abdominal cramps, restlessness, arthralgia, myalgia, and nasal symptoms.69Naltrexone has no  
known sexual side -effects69, supporting its potential acceptability for sexually- active MSM.  
Depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts have been reported in both groups whe n 
comparing naltrexone and placebo for treatment for alcoholism. 69There is no indication that  
naltrexone treatment increases the risk of suicide.63 
 
A review of the literature concluded that in patients treated for heroin or alcohol dependence,  
naltrexone  does not cause clinically significant liver disease or exacerbate pre- existing liver  
disease.71. However, naltrexone has the capacity to cause hepatocellular injury in excessive doses  
and is contraindicated in acute hepatitis and liver failure. 69. Patien ts with these conditions will be  
excluded from our trial. Naltrexone is also contraindicated in patients who are currently dependent on opi[INVESTIGATOR_454907]. The team anticipates that few participants will be 
excluded by [CONTACT_454949][INVESTIGATOR_2441]; for example, in our recently published mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_24174], 
only 7% of MSM met criteria for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561]. Although the opi[INVESTIGATOR_454908],  this situation requires careful medical management by [CONTACT_454950]. Attempts by [CONTACT_454951]’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_454909]. Naltrexone may also precipi[INVESTIGATOR_454910], including mental status  change, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration in 
patients who are not opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -free for a  minimum of [ADDRESS_581707] a foreseeable 
need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_173664] (e.g. potential elective surgery in the study period) will also be 
excluded. Additionally, all patients  will be fully informed verbally and in the written consent form 
about the potential for overdose by  [CONTACT_454952]’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_454911].

 3.2     Secondary Objectives  
To secondary objectives include 1) to  determine the efficacy of targeted naltrexone versus placebo 
in reducing alcohol consumption among non -dependent MSM, as determined by [CONTACT_454954] (EtG) positive urines, over the three -month treatment period; 2) t o determine the 
efficacy of targeted naltrexone versus placebo in reducing alcohol -associated sexual risk 
behaviors, we will use GEE Poisson models with robust standard errors for the four monthly 
ACASI assessments on numbers of male anal sex partners, HIV -serodiscordant unprotected anal 
sex partners, unprotected anal sex partners while intoxicated with alcohol, and unprotected anal 
sex events with serodiscordant partners, in cluding the baseline value. In the event that these 
outcomes are severely over -dispersed, we will analyze indicators for any self -report of each 
behavior, using GEE logistic models.    
[ADDRESS_581708] 
likely populat ion to benefit from this intervention. A study clinician from the Center for Public 
Health Research (CPHR) will perform the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM- IV (SCID) 
to determine eligibility and rule out alcohol dependence (the SCID for DSM -V wil l be used when 
it becomes available). Upon enrollment, 120 participants will be randomized 1:1 to naltrexone or 
placebo for targeted administration. Participants will be seen weekly for behavioral surveys, 
urinalyses, study drug dispensing and alcohol use counseling. Safety laboratory assessment, vital 
signs, and the audio computer assisted survey instrument (ACASI) will be completed monthly. 
Efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability (Specific Aims 1 -4) will be assessed upon trial completion 
as measured by [CONTACT_454955] -back at weekly visits; number of ethyl glucuronide -positive urine samples; sexual 
risk behavior data through monthly surveys via ACASI; frequency of adverse clini cal events by 
[CONTACT_2939], and cumulative medication adherence data at week 12. Primary analyses are 
designed as “intention- to-treat” with evaluation of outcomes according to random assignment, 
regardless of whether participants took the medication.  
 
5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION:  
5.[ADDRESS_581709] 27% reductions in numbers of binge drinking 
occasions, as well as 10% reductions in the average numbers of drinks on drinking days among 
treatment arm compared to placebo arm.  Using the assumptions for loss to follow -up for the 
primary endpoint , as well as estimates based on biomarker  data from Batki et al’s study on 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_454900]122 for the within -subject correlation and control group urine 
positivity rate, we estimate that the study will have 80% power in 2 -sided tests with a type- I error 
rate of 5% to detect 15 -23% reductions in the urine positivity rate in the treatment arm.  The time 
course for the endpoints will be assessed from baseline to end of treatment period.    
5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : 
The secondary efficacy endpoint is based on estimates of within- subject correlati on and control 
prevalence from our Project Echo trial, we estimate that the study will have 80% power to detect 
31% reductions in numbers of male anal sex partners, 57% reductions in SDUA partners, 46%

 reductions in UA partners while intoxicated with alcohol, and 56% reductions in UA events with 
serodiscordant partners. In analyses using GEE logistic models, we will have 80% power to detect 
reductions of 14%, 38%, 39%, and 30% in any report of these four sexual risk behaviors, 
respectively.

8.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
The Better Than Study  will enroll 120 -participants for the double -blinded placebo controlled trial  
where 60 eligible participants will be randomly assigned to the treatment group receiving 
Naltrexone and 60 participants will be randomly assigned to the control group receiving placebo in 
a 1:[ADDRESS_581712] to ensure double -blind administration of study treatments.   
• Access to the randomization code will be strictly  controlled.   
• Packaging and labeling of test and control treatments will be identical to maintain the blind.  
The study blind will be broken on completion of the clinical study and after the study database has 
been locked.  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_454897], Glenn- Milo  Confidential  
 
17 
 During the study, the blind may  be broken only in emergencies when knowledge of the patient’s 
treatment group is necessary for further patient management. When possible, the Investigator 
should discuss the emergency with the Medical Director  prior to unblinding.   
 
Describe the procedur es for unblinding. 
At the end of the study, the biostatistician will provide us with which study drug kits were 
naltrexone treatment and which study drug kits were placebo.  The study drug kits will be compared to the participant enlisted in the study.  St udy Staff will inform the participant verbally 
of their study treatment assignment.  For those who do not respond by [CONTACT_648], a letter will be sent 
to their address to inform the participant of their treatment assignment.

REVIA® (naltrexone hydrochloride tablets USP), an opi[INVESTIGATOR_9727], is a synthetic congener of 
oxymorphone with no opi[INVESTIGATOR_454913]. Naltrexone differs in structure from 
oxymorphone in that the methyl group on the nitrogen  atom  is replaced by a cyclop ropylmethyl 
group. REVIA is also related to the potent opi[INVESTIGATOR_9727], naloxone , or n -allylnoroxymorphone. 
 
REVIA is a white, crystalline compound. The hydrochloride salt is s oluble in water to the extent 
of about 100 mg/mL. REVIA is available in scored film -coated tablets containing 50 mg of 
naltrexone hydrochloride.  
REVIA Tablets also contain: colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, hydroxypropyl

questions the participant might have. 
8.4.3 Administration Instructions  
Training on targeted medication  dosing:  
During enrollment, participants will be trained on medication dosing and be provided a brief 
instructional leaflet for reference. Participan ts will be encouraged to intermittently use at least 3 
capsules per week, when they believe that drinking is imminent or anticipate a session of binge 
drinking. At baseline and follow -up visits, study staff will assess each participant’s drinking 
pattern and develop a plan to support intermittent dosing of study drug and maximize medication efficacy. Participants will be given twenty -eight [ADDRESS_581717] questions.  
 
8.4.4 Storage  
Study drug should be stored by [CONTACT_941] s tudy site at controlled room temperature, Store at

 9.2 Other Clinical Procedures  
9.2.1 M edical Management (MM) counseling for alcohol use:  
This st udy’s aim is to determine efficacy of a pharmacologic intervention to reduce binge 
drinking, against a background of relatively brief counseling that would be feasible in a clinical 
setting with limited resources.  Thus, we will adapt a manualized version o f the MM brief 
counseling platform used in NIAAA’s COMBINE study.72, [ADDRESS_581721] significant reductions in heavy drinking days (Hazard Ratio: 0.72; p=0.02) compared to [ADDRESS_581722], w ith monthly quality

9.2.3 Measures of adherence:   
The study will collect self -reported adherence via weekly modified TLFB assessments, similar to 
prior targeted naltrexone studies11, 81 and via daily SMS text messages. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_454918] o assess adherence. MEMs cap  dispensers  will be used to track medication adherence 
daily; each dispenser opening is recorded as a medication event in a remote database in real time. 
MEMs cap  dispensers have been shown to be reliable for real time monitorin g of medication 
adherence, even in resource -limited settings.[ADDRESS_581724] had great success with electronic medical 
monitoring devices in prior studies among MSM.53, 84 
 
9.2.4 Ecological Momentary Assessments:  
As with our Projec t iN pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], participants will receive daily SMS texts to collect data on 
alcohol consumption, number of drinks on drinking days, and targeted medication administration 
prior to anticipated drinking sessions. Messages will use short -hand notations to maintain 
participant confidentiality. Participants will be trained on text- messaging procedures and receive a 
reference guide during enrollment (see sample from Project iN study in the appendix). Participants 
will be encouraged to regularly delete text messages and encrypt their phone with passwords for 
privacy.

9.3.5 Urinalysis  
[IP_ADDRESS] Urinalysis for other classes of substance use:  Urine samples will be collected weekly 
and tested for methamphetamine, cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and other subst ances of abuse using MEDTOX 
EZ-SCREEN cups. Positive results will be confirmed by [CONTACT_454963][INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Urinalysis for novel alcohol biochemical markers: Urine samples will be collected at 
enrollment and monthly and tested for ethyl glucuronide (EtG) to determine recent alcohol 
consumption. EtG is a relatively novel, highly sensitive indicator for recent alcohol consumption; 
this alcohol biomarker is detectable in urine for approximately 72 hours) .118-[ADDRESS_581727]. Batki’s ongoing 
pharmacologic trials on alcohol dependence at the San Francisco Veteran’s Affairs Medical 
Center. EtG quantitative results will be dichotomized using established cutoff values 
recommended by [CONTACT_454964] (SAMHSA) to 
distinguish between positive and negative specimens.119, 121 Whenever possible we will schedule 
participants for their weekly  visits on Mondays and Tuesdays, given that binge drinking  is likely 
to be higher over the weekend compar ed to the remainder of the week.  
9.3.6 Dried Blood Spot (DSB) Testing for Phosphatidyethanol:  
Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) —a phospholipid formed only in the presence of alcohol —is a novel, 
direct bioche mical marker of  alcohol that has shown high (>95%) sensitivity and specificity to 
detect heavy drinking over a  period of 2- 3 weeks in several studies of dependent patients and 
abstainers. In persons with HIV, recent validation studies found that PEth, using a cutoff of >8 
ng/mL, was 88% sensitive and 89% specific for alcohol consumption in the prior 21 days (3 
weeks), and 95% sensitive and 73%  specific for heavy alcohol consumption (i.e., exceeding the 
NIAAA cutoffs).  DSB samples will be collected at enroll ment, weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and post -

 treatment visits at  month 1, 3, and 6. Staff will use sterile lancets for fingersticks (or we will 
aliquot blood from a  venipuncture specimen tube) to collect drops of blood (less than 5ml) to 
apply onto Whatman 903 filter  paper (Whatman, Maidstone, [LOCATION_006]). Samples will be dried overnight 
inside a drying box using  standardized methods. PEth testing of DBS samples will be conducted at 
the [LOCATION_002] Drug  Testing Laboratories in Des Plaines, IL, one of the few laboratories th at 
conduct this test  worldwide. The testing will be conducted using an Agilent 6460 liquid 
chromatography -tandem  mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) system following extraction into 
methanol, as previously  published.  
 
9.3.7 Genetic and Biomarker Testing: Blood sa mples will be stored at the University of 
[LOCATION_004]  San Francisco, School of Nursing Genomics Lab for future genetic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_454921], as well as other studies that elucidate the biologic processes by [CONTACT_454965]. Research studies will be restricted to health 
conditions  associated with alcohol use. These may include testing to determine the presence of the 
A118G  SNP and other mutations relevant to the moderation of naltrexone’s effects on the μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_454922] (OPRM1). Additionally, we may test for the expression of biomarkers associated  
with innate immune activation (i.e., sCD14, neopterin, and tryptophan/kynurenine ratio) and  
inflammation (i.e., IL -6, TNF - R1).

11 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a patient 
adminis tered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration 
of an investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product.  An 
unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity or frequency than expected based on the information 
in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs during each 
subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  Adve rse events will be 
recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates 
and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.  
AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including laboratory abnormalities 
judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be found in the study manual.  If the 
expe rience is not covered in the modified criteria, the guidelines shown in Table 1 below should 
be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity 
and that a severe A E is not necessarily serious.  
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be awa re of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospit alizations possible.  
Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.

AE Relationship to Study Drug 
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the guidelines 
in Table 2.  
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  
to Drug  Comment 
Definite ly Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_454924]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846].  
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confir med by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_41847].  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administrat ion of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the stud y 
drug. 
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse experience  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed.  
 
11.2.1 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per UCSF 
CHR Guid elines .  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed consent is obtained 
and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.

 Members and affiliation:  We will use the existing University of [LOCATION_004], Los Angeles (UCLA) 
Data & Safety Monitoring Board for Addiction Medicine (DSMBAM), which has extensive 
experience in monitoring pharmacologic interventions, including among vulnerable populations. 
The DSMBAM has monitored all of our pharmacologic trials for substance users.    
 To ensure that the DSMB oversight of the study remains independent from the proposed study, 
the PI(Santos) as well as others who serve o n the DSMBAM that might be linked with the study in 
some way recuse themselves from review of the present study.  
 The purpose of the DSMBAM is to provide oversight and monitoring of Phase I and Phase II 
clinical trials of pharmacological and behavioral tr eatments for stimulant dependence. There are 
three fundamental charges of the board, which are:  
• To ensure the safety of trial participants   
• To preserve validity and integrity of research data   
• To facilitate the availability of timely as well as re liable findings to the broader clinical 
community

 The DSMC evaluates known risks to subjects’ participation, the safety of the subjects as pre-
specified in the protocol, and monitors the operational perfor mance of the trial. The DSMC makes 
recommendations to continue, amend, or terminate the trial based on their findings. Recommendations are made in writing to the study investigators. The DSMC are given blinded 
trial data, but may request unblinding if safe ty data warrant. The initial review includes a review 
of the following items: statement of the protocol design, characteristics of the study data collection 
site, inclusion/exclusion criteria, randomization plan, definition of participants (e.g., screened, 
enrolled, randomized, treated, drop- out, lost to follow -up), intervention definition, dosage and 
frequency of study drug, reasons to discontinue study or to terminate individual participants, reasons to discontinue treatment, outcome measures, sample size target, key adherence and safety 
variables, and the data analysis plan.  
Subsequent ongoing reviews include: enrollment data, including those screened, enrolled, and 
active; subject eligibility; demographic characteristics of participants (total, and by g roup), 
recruitment and retention (total and by [CONTACT_19313]). Protocol compliance are evaluated by [CONTACT_42574]: the expected recruitment rate, study drop- outs and reasons for leaving the study, data quality 
assurance reports, overall data flow procedures, CRFs coll ected, received, and entered; protocol 
deviations; protocol violations; missing data; staff omissions; subject refusal to provide data; 
adherence to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. The data safety report are provided in total and by [CONTACT_19313], and include 
any relevant medical , psychosocial or laboratory data, AEs summarized in tables, individual SAE 
reports, concomitant medications, and concomitant illnesses. The outcome data report includes outcome data analyzed by [CONTACT_19313], masked or unblended, with or without statistical analy ses, and 
include all outcome variables.  
15 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be 
written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain a ny modifications to 
the analysis plan described below.

 15.2 Demographic  and Baseline Characteristics  
The following demographic variables at screening will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]: race, 
gender, age, educational attainment, employed, and HIV positivity.  
15.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
To determine the efficacy of target ed naltrexone versus placebo in reducing binge drinking among 
non-dependent MSM, as determined by [CONTACT_454946] -back 
(TLFB), by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. GEE Poisson models with robust standard errors will be used to assess reductions 
on week ly drinking outcomes . Baseline TLFB results will be included in the analysis.   Minimum 
detectable effects (MDEs):  In calculating minimum detectable effects, we hypothesized on 
pharmacologic grounds that oral naltrexone will reach full efficacy against alc ohol use almost 
immediately; accordingly we expect treatment -control differences to be approximately constant 
over the 12 weeks of the trial. Based on the prior trial (93% retention), we estimate that 90% of 
participants will be retained at [ADDRESS_581737] 80% power in 2- sided tests with a 
type-I error rate  of 5% to detect 27% reductions in numbers of binge drinking occasions, as well as 
10% reductions in the average numbers of drinks on drinking days.   
To determine the efficacy of targeted naltrexone versus placebo in reducing alcohol consumption 
among non- dependent MSM, as determined by [CONTACT_454947] (EtG) positive 
urines, by [INVESTIGATOR_216].  GEE logistic models with robust standard errors will be used to assess reductions 
frequency of positive urine tests, accounting for within -subject correlat ion.   MDEs : Using the 
assumptions for loss to follow -up for Aim 1, as well as estimates based on biomarker  data from 
Batki et al’s study on Topi[INVESTIGATOR_454900]122 for the within -subject correlation and 
control group urine positivity rate, we estimate that the study will have 80% power in 2- sided tests 
with a type -I error rate of 5% to detect 15 -23% reductions in the urine positivity rate  in the 
treatment arm.  
15.[ADDRESS_581738] errors for the four monthly ACASI assessments on numbers of male anal sex 
partners, HIV -serodiscordant unprotected anal sex partners, unprotected anal sex partners while 
intoxicated with alcohol, and unprotected anal sex events with serodiscordant partners, including 
the baseline value. In the event that these outcomes are severely over -dispersed, we will analyze 
indicators for any self -report of each behavior, using GEE logistic models.   MDEs : Based on 
estimates of within -subject correlation and c ontrol prevalence from our Project Echo trial, we 
estimate that the study will have 80% power to detect 31% reductions in numbers of male anal sex 
partners, 57% reductions in SDUA partners, 46% reductions in UA partners while intoxicated with 
alcohol, and 56% reductions in UA events with serodiscordant partners. In analyses using GEE 
logistic models, we will have 80% power to detect reductions of 14%, 38%, 39%, and 30% in any 
report of these four sexual risk behaviors, respectively.     
Safety and tolerability data will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].   
Adverse event rates will be coded by [CONTACT_374640].  Adverse 
events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_454971], the rate of occurrence, and the severity and relationship to study drug.

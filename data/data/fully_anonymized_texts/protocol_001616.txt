Protocol  for “Mitigation of radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis ” 
 
Cohen VA [ADDRESS_286676] . It is based on the hypothesis that human normal tissue 
radiation injury can be safely and effectively mitigated, and on our extensive studies of 
radiomitigation in experimental anima ls. Lung cancer is more common in veterans than in the 
general population; this project is highly relevant to the medical care of veterans.  
 
Research design and methodology  
 
 Enalapril or placebo will commence after the start of irradiation in veterans und ergoing radiation 
therapy for lung cancer  and other cancers in the chest , and their effects on radiation 
pneumonitis and fibrosis will be compared as the primary outcome measure. Enalapril will be 
used rather than captopril, because enalapril is given in s ingle daily doses. This is a 
prospective, double -blinded, randomized, placebo -controlled trial, in a secondary -tertiary care 
setting. Subjects will join this trial voluntarily, based on their planned radiotherapy for lung 
cancer, and it is planned to enrol l [ADDRESS_286677] to reduce radiographic evidence of pneumonitis and fibrosis.

1. PURPOSE.  Provide the purpose or objectives of the study.  Do not indicate "N/A" for 
this category.  
To test the benefit of enalapril, an angiotensin -converting -enzyme -inhibitor, to mitigate 
radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis in humans.  
 
2. SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE.  Provide the reasons for doing the study.  Do not indicate 
"N/A" for this category.  
This project will test the effect of enalapril, an angiotensin -converting -enzyme inhibitor, to 
mitigate radiation pneumonitis  and fibrosis in veterans undergoing radiation therapy for lung 
cancer  and other cancers in the chest . It is based on the hypothesis that human normal 
tissue radiation injury can be safely and effectively mitigated, and on our extensive studies 
of radiomit igation in experimental animals. Lung cancer is more common in veterans than 
in the general population; this project is highly relevant to the medical care of veterans.  
 
 
3. BACKGROUND .  Provide information from previous studies leading up to this study, 
either from your laboratory or from those of others.  If this is a treatment study involving 
investigational drugs, devices, or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], standard treatment must be clearly identified.  Do 
not indicate "N/A" for this category.  
Lung cancer is an important health problem for veterans. It is more common in them than in 
the general population, and lung cancer survival is less in veterans. Radiation therapy for 
lung cancer is used in over half of the cases, and it can be followed by [CONTACT_236875]. These add significant morbidity and mortality, and they limit the 
doses of curative irradiation. Standard treatments for radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis are 
very limited. Mitigation is a new approach, being the use of an agent after initial irra diation 
but before the expression of radiation injury.  
Our studies in rats show significant mitigation of radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis by 
[CONTACT_236876] (ACE) inhibitors.  
Our recent clinical trial shows the mitigation of radiation ne phropathy by [CONTACT_236877].   
Our retrospective clinical studies show that concurrent use of ACE inhibitors reduces the 
occurrence of radiation pneumonitis [and fibrosis], without lowering cancer -related survival.  
The safe mitigation of radi ation injury has been identified as a priority by [CONTACT_28129]. We will address this critical problem. We hypothesize that the occurrence 
of radiation pneumonitis, fibrosis, or both in patients receiving radiation for lung cancer will 
be decreased by [CONTACT_236878], started after irradiation.  
 
 
4. STUDY DESIGN .  Provide a brief description of the design of the study (multicenter, 
double -blind, randomized, etc.) in narrative form.  Do not provide details of specific procedures

8. INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURE.  Describe the circumstances surrounding the 
consent procedure, including sett ing and whether privacy interests are protected during the 
consent procedure, subject autonomy concerns, language difficulties, vulnerable populations, 
and other details.  Include the procedures for assessing the subject’s capacity to consent.  
Outline the  procedures for ensuring sufficient opportunity for subjects to decide, and the 
procedures to ensure that subjects give consent without coercion.  Describe the procedures for 
documentation of informed consent, including chart documentation, using witnesses , 
translators, and document storage.  Indicate the procedures for informing subjects of new 
findings.  
 
(Please also read "Obtaining Informed Consent" at the beginning of this packet.)  
 
Waiver of informed consent requires completion of a "Request for Waiver  of Informed Consent" 
form and a "Request for Waiver of Subject Authorization."  
Waiver of documentation of informed consent requires completion of a "Request for Waiver of 
Documentation of Informed Consent" form and an information sheet (format on our web site).  
 
The consent procedure takes place in the Radiation Oncology clinics at the ZVAMC  or the 
Baltimore VAMC . Privacy and autonomy will be ensured by [CONTACT_28773]. The 
purpose of the study, the procedures of the study, its risks and benefit s, and alternatives 
will all be explained as part of the consent process. Vulnerable populations will not be used. 
Assessment of capacity to consent will be identical to assessment of capacity to consent to 
usual treatment, including radiation treatment. T his includes assessment of orientation and 
understanding of risk and benefit. Subjects will be able to view the consent form in writing, 
will be able to ask questions of the coordinator and the co -investigator, and will not be 
coerced. Documentation will b e in writing and will be stored on the VA CPRS record. 
Witnesses will participate as required. The coordinator and co -investigator have ample 
experience with clinical studies and will adhere to their existing high standards for securing 
consent. New findin gs will be communicated to all study participants when these findings 
are available.  
 
Names and qualifications of those obtaining informed consent.

9. PROCEDURES.   REVISED   Describe all procedures involving the participation of 
human subjects, chart review, or collection of samples.  Provide details.  Include the location 
where the study will take place.  Do not indicate  "N/A" for this category.  
 
If the protocol involves "usual care," you must clearly differentiate the research intervention(s) 
from "usual care" (whether the "usual care" is limited to one arm of the study or is being 
delivered to all study subjects).  You must also clearly designate the individual or entity (e.g., the 
appropriate research personnel vs the subject's health care provider) responsible for relevant 
aspects of both the research and the "usual care."  
 
The study drug, enalapril or placebo, will be  in addition to usual clinical care of 
subjects undergoing radiation therapy for lung cancer. Enalapril, or placebo, will be 
given orally, started within a day to up to 30 days of  the beginning of the radiation 
treatments . They will be enrolled at the star t of radiation therapy (RT), stratified for cancer 
stage, then randomized to enalapril or identical -appearing placebo. Randomization will be 
done by [CONTACT_204105], Medical College of Wisconsin, using random  
number tables; the center pharm acies will be notified of the assignment to enalapril or 
placebo. There will be no stratification by [CONTACT_654], gender, lung cancer histology, or use of 
chemotherapy since these do not have a consistent relation with the occurrence of RP. 
There is no stratificat ion by [CONTACT_384]. Study drug is obtained from Expert Pharmacy Inc, with 
identical appearing enalapril and placebo tablets. It is held in the VA research pharmacy at 
Milwaukee, in a restricted access area under the aegis of the research pharmacist. It will be 
sent to patients at the Baltimore site upon their enrollment. The study drug dose will be 
2.5 mg to start, and will be increased in increments of 2.5 mg to 10 mg per day, as 
tolerated. Clinical follow up of study subjects will be identical to that of subjec ts 
undergoing radiation therapy for lung cancer but who are not participating in this 
study, with the addition of four blood samples. One blood sample one week after 
starting the study will be to check for adverse effects of the study drug. Three more 
blood samples will be obtained for renin -angiotensin system (RAS) assays, done on 
three blood samples from each subject, at the start of the study, at [ADDRESS_286681] es will be approximately one teaspoon of blood obtained by 
[CONTACT_48571]. Compliance is assessed by [CONTACT_236880]. It will be verified at the end of the study by [CONTACT_236881] d to those on placebo. Study subjects will be 
monitored for adverse effects of study drug.  The development, or not, of radiation 
pneumonitis and fibrosis will be assessed in the study subjects, as part of ongoing 
regular care, as are the periodic radiogra phic imaging and lung function testing.  
Quality of life will also be assessed.  
 
10. RISKS AND PRECAUTIONS.  Provide a description of all risks (physical, psychological, 
social, legal, and/or economic) for each drug or procedure used.  Indicate how risks will be 
minimized, including a description of procedures already being performed on the subjects for 
diagnostic or treatment purposes that will be used.  Provide a description of these procedures. 
Distinguish risks associated with research from risks of th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_236869].  Include precautions to be taken to minimize the danger 
and/or pain.  Provide a plan for notifying subjects of new findings that may affect their 
willingness to participate in the projec t.  If there are no risks to participating in the study, this 
should be stated.  Do not indicate "N/A" for this category.  
 
Investigational devices:  Include the risks of procedures involved in the use of investigational 
device and risks of investigational device compared to risks of alternative devices or 
procedures.  
 
Enalapril is an angiotensin -converting -enzyme inhibitor in common use, for treatment of 
hypertension, kidney disease, and heart failure. It is used to lower blood pressure, and is 
also used i n normotensive subjects with heart failure.  Subjects with normal blood pressure 
who would use enalapril to mitigate radiation injury could develop low blood pressure which 
could cause dizziness and drug intolerance. This will be avoided by [CONTACT_108355] l ow doses 
and increasing the drug dose, as tolerated. Elevation in serum potassium could occur; we 
will test for this in one extra blood sample, and monitor for it in subsequent usual clinical 
follow -up. Between 2 and 5% of subjects using enalapril could de velop a cough, which 
resolves within a few days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478]. Intolerable cough will lead us to stop the 
study drug.  The safety of enalapril in this use is very likely, because we have documented 
the safe use of lisinopril, another angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitor and a congener 
of enalapril, in veterans at ZVAMC undergoing radiation therapy for lung cancer. These 
were subjects already on lisinopril when they underwent radiation therapy for lung cancer. 
We found no adverse effects of this us e of lisinopril. In another study, we used captopril 
compared to placebo in bone marrow transplant patients, to mitigate chronic renal failure. 
There was no difference in drug tolerance in patients on captopril compared to those on 
placebo.  
The therapeutic  risk is that of the medical care by, during, and after radiation therapy for 
lung cancer. The research risk is that of the use of the study drug, enalapril or placebo, as 
detailed above. There is also the risk of obtaining blood for RAS studies. There is no 
alternative to the therapeutic risk, for subjects undergoing radiation therapy, because it is 
the standard of care for those subjects. The alternative to the research risk is to not 
participate in this study. The alternative is to undergo usual and cust omary care, by 
[CONTACT_236882].  
Data security and confidentiality will be maintained according to the rules of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs. Risks to breach of privacy and confidentiality will thereby [CONTACT_236883].  
All data for this study will only be stored on password -protected VA computers. Data 
collection for complications of treatment, adverse and severe adverse events will be done 
by a dedicated study coordinator who will prospectively track all of the subjects of this 
study.  
 
 
11. ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE STUDY AND RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT.    
Describe the benefit to the subject and/or benefit to science. State if subjects will receive no 
benefit.  
 
Investigational devices:  Benefits of investigational device c ompared to benefits of alternative 
devices or procedures.  
 
Subjects in this study may have a fifty percent or more reduction in the occurrence of 
radiation pneumonitis. Based on pre -clinical data in laboratory animals, we expect that to 
occur in subjects o n enalapril compared to subjects on placebo. But this is not known or 
guaranteed, which is why this study of enalapril compared to placebo must be done. Based 
on extensive use of enalapril for other indications, and on our study of its congener, 
lisinopril , in veterans undergoing radiation therapy for lung cancer, the risks of this study 
related to use of study drug are small, and reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits 
to subjects and others.  
 
 
The broad, long -term objective of our work is to a chieve effective and safe mitigation of normal 
tissue radiation injuries for any tissue type. We and others have successfully mitigated normal 
tissue radiation injury (NTRI) of kidneys, lungs, skin, and brain, using laboratory rat models. The 
success of th ese human studies will have a high impact for subjects at risk of NTRI to the lungs. 
This will improve the health of veterans with lung cancer, which is highly relevant to the mission 
of the Department of Veterans Affairs. That success will be a significan t impetus to extend the 
radiomitigation concept to other normal tissues at risk during radiation therapy, such as spi[INVESTIGATOR_236870].  
 
12. DATA SAFETY MONITORING.   REVISED   A data and safety monitoring plan is 
required for all interventional clinical re search protocols that involve more than minimal risk to 
subjects.  Provide the following information:  
 
a. The type of data or events to be captured under the monitoring plan, including SAEs, 
and how will safety information be collected (e.g., with case rep ort forms, at study visits, by 
[CONTACT_40225]).   
b. Who will be responsible for monitoring the data collected (investigators, sponsor, a 
coordinating or statistical center, an independent medical monitor, a data safety monitoring 
board (DSM B) or data monitoring committee (DMC), or some other entity)? If there is a data 
safety monitoring board (DSMB), describe its composition and indicate if it is 
independent of the sponsor.  If no DSMB, provide the statistical tests for analyzing the safety 
data to determine if harm is occurring.  
c. Procedures for communicating to the IRB, the sponsor, and other appropriate entities 
the outcome of the reviews by [CONTACT_236884]. If DSMB reports  will be forwarded to the 
IRB, include the interval they will  be submitted.  Members of DSMBs/DMCs are encouraged to 
complete human subjects research training.  
d. Process for monitoring and reporting adverse events and unanticipated problems  to the 
monitoring entity and IRB, and include the time frames for reporting  these events.  Include the 
following statement: Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others (UAPs), 
internal serious adverse events (SAEs), and protocol deviations/violations will be reported to the 
IRB using the local reporting form with in 5 days of notification of the event.  
e. The frequency of data collection and assessments  of data or events captured by [CONTACT_236885], such as points in time or after a specific number of participants are enrolled.  
f. The definition of specific tri ggers or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_236871] (e.g., studies may be stopped when there is a greater than expected rate of morbidity 
or mortality or when the experimental arm of a head to head comparison study is shown to be 
better or worse statistically than the standard care arm).  
 
For retrospective studies, include whether or not you will discuss with the subjects 
potential study outcomes that may have an effect on their health or well being and when 
and how you will notify indivi dual subjects or their health care providers of these 
findings.  
 
***Additional information is provided in “Data Safety Monitoring Plans” at the beginning of this 
packet***  
 
 
a. Data or events to be captured included the development of adverse reaction s to  
study drug, including cough, low blood pressure, elevation in serum potassium, fall in white 
blood cell count, or red blood cell count (anemia). It is estimated that each of these have a 
risk of less than 5%. This information will be collected at study vi sits, upon report by [CONTACT_236886], will be documented on report forms, and will be verified by [CONTACT_236887]. Serious adverse events (SAE) are those that cause 
significant morbidity or threat to life.  
b. Investigators and the study coordinator will be responsible for monitoring the data 
collected, and will report safety data to a central VA DMSB , the Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) at Hines VAMC,  upon enrollment of 50, 100, [ADDRESS_286682] yearly.  
d. Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others (UAPs), internal serious 
adverse events (SAEs), and protocol deviations/violations will be reported to the IRB and 
the DMC using the local repo rting form within [ADDRESS_286683] and that they do not constitute (or 
appear to constitute) und ue pressure on the subject to volunteer for the research study.  
Describe any non -VA compensation for injured research subjects.  
 
No compensation will be provided  
 
14. PRIVACY .  Provide provisions to protect the privacy interests of subjects.  Indicate th at 
all research personnel will respect the dignity, cultural, psychosocial, spi[INVESTIGATOR_236872], beliefs, preferences, and personal privacy of research subjects as outlined in Medical 
Center Memorandum [ADDRESS_286684]'s gender, cultural, psychosocial, spi[INVESTIGATOR_236873], beliefs 
and preferences, and how the subject may interact with the procedure to be performed, 
especially if the procedure involves intim ate physical aspects.  Personal privacy includes pulling 
cubicle curtains around a bed, closing the room door while providing care or interviewing a 
subject, providing auditory privacy, knocking on a room door before entering, covering the 
subject appropri ately both in privacy and in public areas, etc.

Goal: To determine if acute exposure to abnormal glucose levels induces mitochondrial fission and 
endothelial dysfunction through increased Drp1- Fis1 activity in humans.  
 
 
Rationale : While DM often includes multiple metabolic abnormalities, the central phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_898744].  Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia (occurring secondary to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), both acutely and chronically, are critical to both chronic and acute -on-chronic endothelial dysfunction in DM.
1-[ADDRESS_1259616] mitochondrial fission leading to subsequent excessive mitochondrial superoxide production.16, 17  
Molecular suppression of Drp1 or Fis1 blocks hyperglycemia’s adverse impact cultured endothelial cells.16 Our 
preliminary data show that Drp1 and Fis1 also control low glucose driven mitochondrial fission and excessive 
mitochondrial ROS production (Fig X or not shown).  While there are multiple docking proteins for Drp1 on the 
outer mitochondrial membrane besides Fis1 (Mff, MiD49, MiD51), Fis1 is the preferred Drp1 docking protein in 
the setting of cellular stressors, including high glucose, in cell culture.18-[ADDRESS_1259617] the hypothesis that acute in vivo exposure to hyperglycemi a increases  
mitochondrial network fragmentation and 
mitochondrial ROS production in human 
arterial endothelial cells .  Affirmative 
findings will critically establish that acute in 
vivo exposure to clinically relevant 
hyperglycemia levels in humans triggers 
mitochondrial fission and excess 
mitochondrial ROS production. Further, affirmative findings will establish that 
inhibition of mitochondrial fission proteins 
Fis1 and D rp1 reverses acute dysglycemia -
related endothelial dysfunction.  
 Protocol  
Subjects  will be recruited according to our 
inclusion/exclusion criteria listed in Table 1.  
We employ a multifaceted approach to 
recruitment, including flyers, community 
newspaper ads, internet ad postings, and 
direct recruitment from the Internal 
Medicine Clinics of Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/Medical College of 
Wisconsin which saw appr oximately 50,[ADDRESS_1259618] is leveraged to identify potential subjects by  
[CONTACT_898750] . .Potential subjects will undergo phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_898745] a detailed 
medical history, anthropomorphic measurements, blood pressure and heart rate measurements, and a blood 
draw for measurements that include fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin, creatinine, and liver 
function tests.   Healthy, non- DM subjects who pass the screening as per the inclusion/exclusion criteria in Table 
2 will be enrolled in the study protocol.   Table 1 : Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for Aims [ADDRESS_1259619] criteria 
Inclusion Criteria for Healthy subjects 
1. Adult age 21 to 70  
2. No evidence of metabolic syndrome or diabetes, hypertension (BP≥140/90), 
or high cholesterol (LDL≥160) at the time of screening . 
T2DM Subject Exclusion Criteria:  
        1.      History of stroke, peripheral arterial disease, or coronary artery disease (as   
                 defined by [CONTACT_898751] ≥ 40% on  
                 angiography or by [CONTACT_898752] ). History  of bleeding disorders.  
        2.      Evidence of other evident major illness including chronic renal  
                 insufficiency(plasma creatinine > 1.4 for women or 1.5 for men), liver  
                 disease (AST or ALT greater than 2.5 x normal), and cancer currently  
                 undergoing therapy or had therapy for cancer within [ADDRESS_1259620]     
4. Thienopyridine, anti-thrombin/Xa , or warfarin therapy at time of screening 
Exclusion Criteria for Healthy Subjects:  
1. Meet any of the exclusion criteria for diabetic or metabolic syndrome group  
2. Meet criteria for type [ADDRESS_1259621]  (12 hours) , subjects will come in the morning to our Adult Translational 
Research Unit (A -TRU) which is part of the Clinical Translational Research Initiative of Southeast Wisconsin 
(8UL1TR000055).  An antecubital intravenous line will be placed to facilitate blood glucose sampling during the 
hyperglycemic challenge.  An antecubital intravenous catheter will be placed to facilitate obtaining endothelial 
cells from the vein  by J- wire biopsy for of mitochondrial testing.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_898746] J -wire 
endothelial cell biopsy technique,  and the technique has been extensively validated technique.22-[ADDRESS_1259622]-
ingestion, J -wire endothelial biopsies of the radial artery will be repeated.  Three separate J wires will be passed  
into the radial artery for each measurement time point (0,1, and 2 hours).  
 Because of the prolonged fast, subjects may have a decrease in blood sugar to <70 during this study.  
To mitigate this phenomenon, subjects will be given 6 ounces of juice to drink at the 2- hour mark.  If subjects 
report symptoms of hypoglycemia, which include but are not limited to feeling tremulous, headache, 
lightheadedness, feeling clammy or sweaty and nausea, the blood glucose level will be checked via a fingerstick.  
If the blood glucose level is < 70, they will be treated with juice and/or food.  The fingerstick will also be repeated 
periodically to ensure adequate response to the intervention.  
 In non- DM subjects, the [ADDRESS_1259623] challenge.  We will visualize 
the mitochondrial networks in these cells  using our previously reported and validated immunofluorescence method using  cytochrome c antibodies to tag the mitochondria.
27  Network fragmentation (high number=greater 
fragmentation and fission) will be quantified by [CONTACT_898753] (NIH, 
Bethesda) using a validated protocol adapted in collaboration with [CONTACT_898756] from the University of 
Illinois -Chicago.30, 31   
 
SUB- STUDY:  The J -wire procedure proposed in this protocol is used to isolate endothelial cells and used to 
measure mitochondrial network complexity. In order to train (new) study staff on this procedure, as well as refine 
the best way to isolate these cells off the wires after they have been obtained from a subject approximately 20 
subjects will be enrolled into a “sub- study” under this protocol. In this sub- study, subjects will sign informed 
consent one or two antecubital IV lines will be paced. The Research Fellow or PI [INVESTIGATOR_898747] [ADDRESS_1259624]. Subjects in this sub- study could enroll in the main study if desired, they would be 
consented again with the main study consent.  
 
 
PRELIMINARY DATA: Our published work supports the feasibility of measuring mitochondrial network 
fragmentation in endothelial  cells captured by J -wire biopsy.16    
 Mitochondrial superoxide production using MitoSox ™(Life Technologies).  Cells are re -suspended in PBS 
buffer and incubated for 30 minutes at 37ºC with 5 µM of MitoSox ™ (Invitrogen), a fluorescent probe specific for 
mitochondrial superoxide production. Cells are then immediately fixed with  2% paraformaldehyde  and plated on 
poly-lysine coated slides (Sigma, St. Louis) and allowed to settle.  Following the 
addition of DAPI (4’, 6’ -diamidino- 2-phenylindole hydrochloride) for nuclear 
identification to help discern endothelial cells from polymorphonuclear cells, fluorescence intensity of endothelial cells are measured by [CONTACT_898754] (N ikon E55i).   Images are analyzed using MetaMorph  6.1 (Universal 
Imaging).  Fifteen to twenty cells are measured,  and the average fluorescence 
intensity reported for each sa mple . All images are captured  with the same 
exposure time. Values are reported ratios of subject fluorescence to that of 
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stained simultaneously for Figure 2:  Sample endothelial cells 
taken from a hu man volunteer after 60 
minutes of   euglycemia (a) and 
hypoglycemia (b).  Red-  MitoSox ™,

interexperimental normalization.23, 24, 32  PRELIMINARY DATA: We have successfully obtained vascular  
endothelial cells using the J -wire technique and measured mitochondrial superoxide production prior to and 
following lowering blood glucose levels for 1 hour, proving the feasibility of these measurements ( Figure. 2 ).  
 
Data Analysis and Sample Sizes:  The primary outcome for this sub- aim is the measurement of mitochondrial 
network complexity from before oral glucose administration to [ADDRESS_1259625] measurements.  These will be 
compared by [CONTACT_54959] t -tests with log transformation for normality or non- parametric methods if needed. A 
secondary analysis using repeated measures ANOVA will also be performed using data from all 3 time  points. 
Marginal/conditional residual diagnostics and influence diagnostics will be performed. If some of them are 
violated, log- transformation or non- parametric methods will be considered.   Sample size calculations for 
mitochondrial network complexity measurements were derived  from our observations of  HUVECs described in 
our preliminary data section.  The mean difference in network fragmentation in the preliminary data was 1.5±0.[ADDRESS_1259626] and repeated 
measures ANOVA assuming 30% inflation in the number need to account for dropouts  and failed J -wire captures. 
A mean difference between before oral glucose administration and [ADDRESS_1259627] measurements in network 
complexity was assumed to be 40% lower than our preliminary data in light of our less aggressive in vivo 
hyperglycemic exposure and the same standard deviation.  Also, [ADDRESS_1259628] 90% power at α=[ADDRESS_1259629]

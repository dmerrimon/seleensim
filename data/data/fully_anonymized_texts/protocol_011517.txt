 2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1  Metastatic  Prostate Cancer and Androgen Signaling  
Every year in the [LOCATION_002], about 30,000  men die of metas tatic prostate cancer (PCa).[ADDRESS_396853] androgen deprivati on therapy (ADT) over seventy years 
ago,[ADDRESS_396854] atic hormone-sensitive 
prostate cancer (mHSPC) has been limited to introducing different modalities of delivering ADT.3  
 
The primary therapeutic maneuver for newly diagnosed metastatic  prostate cancer is androgen 
deprivation, which is accomplishe d by [CONTACT_321589]-agonists/anta gonists with or without an anti androgen such as bicalutamide. 
Although the vast majority of mHSPC will initially respond to A DT, it is well established that the 
quality and duration of response is variable, and most will pro gress to castration-resistant disease.  
The current median survival of mHSPC is about 4 years.4 At present, all patients with newly 
diagnosed mHSPC are treated with a “one size fits all” approach with no means by [CONTACT_321590].    
2.[ADDRESS_396855] 
proliferation is up-regulation of cyclin D which complexes with the cyclin-dependent kinase 
(CDK) 4/6, resulting in phosphorylation of RB, a cell-cycle bra ke. Because RB is a transcriptional 
repressor which binds to the regulatory region of genes whose f unctions are important for cell 
cycle progression and DNA replication, phosphorylation of RB re lieves this repression and allows 
the cell to proceed through the cell-cycle and divide. RB is th erefore an important tumor suppressor 
and is lost in early stages in  several human malignancies (e.g. breast, cervical, and small cell lung 
cancer).
5,[ADDRESS_396856] (loss of RB, upregulation 
of cyclin D) are instead felt t o promote castra tion-resistance.7   
 The relationship between AR and RB is complex.  While AR signaling results in RB phosphorylation and cell-cycle p rogression, expression of the gene encoding the androgen receptor 
(AR) is also under RB control.
8 Loss of RB caused de-repression of the AR locus, excessive AR 
production, and castration-resistan t (ligand-independent) AR ac tivity that proved sufficient to 
by[CONTACT_294585].8 Therefore, AR signaling is closely linked with RB control. 
 
2.3  Role of CDK4/6 Inhibitors in Prostate Cancer    
 
CDK4/6 inhibition markedly inhib its prostate cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.  
Exposure of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines to the  CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib (PD 
0332991) significantly decreases active cell cycle progression (through measurement of BrdU 
incorporation kinetics) (Figure 1, top left) and production of factors (cyclins A and E1) necessary 
for cell cycle progression in an RB-dependent manner (Figure 1,  top right). These results were 
recapi[INVESTIGATOR_321537] (Fi gure 1, bottom) as well as ex vivo  
human tissue model systems. Such decreases in cell cycle progre ssion were accompanied by 
[CONTACT_321591] r Ki67 (Figure 2).9 
11 
  
RB-proficient prostate cancer c ells are preferentially sensitiv e to CDK4/[ADDRESS_396857] demonstrated a clear 
requirement for the retention of  functional RB protein in the r esponse to CDK4/6 inhibition.  
Among populations deficient for RB protein, inhibition of CDK4/ 6 activity was not able to 
decrease the rate of cells progressing through active cell cycl e.9 
 
CDK4/[ADDRESS_396858] demonstrated that CDK4/6 directly associa tes with the androgen receptor 
and enhances transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells.10 AR activity is coupled to the cell 
cycle machinery primarily through its ability to up-regulate cyclin D protein level (reviewed in8). 
Once produced, cyclin D partners with CDKs [ADDRESS_396859] shown that cyclin D protein is capable of negatively regulating AR activity at AR target genes.
12  Thus, increases in intracellular cyclin D protein levels are known to 
negatively regulate AR function, and would be hypothesized to d ecrease AR-driven prostate 
cancer cell growth.  This postulate is supported by [CONTACT_321592], unp ublished microarray analyses of AR-
positive prostate cancer cells in the presence and absence of PD 0332991 (Karen Knudsen, personal communication).  palboc iclib selectively suppressed ex pression of a subset of AR target 
genes known to be critical for castrate-resistant AR activity ( eg UBE2C, Rad51, Fen1), while 
having no effect on early-stage AR targets (e.g. PSA, not shown ), and little impact on others such 
as Nkx3.1.  Therefore, because palbociclib suppressed AR-depend ent gene expression of some 
targets, it may act in concert with standard-of-care (androgen deprivation) to further suppress 
expression of target genes known to promote disease progression/therapeutic response.

13  Palbociclib 
specifically inhibits CDK4-catal yzed phosphorylation of retinob lastoma protein.  It has previously 
been shown to inhibit growth of human xenograft tumors includin g prostate cancers grown in 
mice.9   
 
Mechanism of Action 
 
Selectivity:  Palbociclib is a highly selective inhibitor of CD K4/cyclinD1 kinase activity (IC50 = 
11 nM; Ki = 2 nM). Palbociclib ha s selectivity for CDK4/6, with  little or no activity against a large 
panel of 34 other protein kina ses including other CDKs and a wi d e  v a r i e t y  o f  t y r o s i n e  a n d  
serine/threonine kinases. CDK6, an other enzyme that also comple xes with cyclin-D subunits, is 
also commonly expressed in mam malian cells and tumors. CDK6 is highly homologous to CDK4 
and can perform the same function by [CONTACT_321593], thus p otentially creating a redundant 
mechanism to promote cell cycle progression. Consequently, inhi bition of both enzymes is 
necessary to ensure complete suppression of RB phosphorylation and the greatest possible 
spectrum of antitumor activity. Results indicate that palbocicl ib inhibits CDK6 with equivalent 
potency to CDK4. 
 
13 
 Inhibition of RB phosphorylation:  The only known natural subst rate for CDK4/cyclinD1 is the 
retinoblastoma gene product, RB. Specific CDK4 phosphorylation sites on RB include serine-[ADDRESS_396861] ca rcinoma cell line was 0.066 
M. Palbociclib was equally effective at reducing RB phosphorylation at serine-795 in this tumor 
cell line with an IC50 of 0.063 M. Similar effects on serine-780 and serine-795 phosphorylation  
were obtained in the hormone sensi tive prostate cancer cell lin e VCaP.9 
 
Anti-Proliferative Effects:  Palbociclib inhibits cellular proliferation and prevents cellular DNA 
synthesis by [CONTACT_321594] S phase of the cell  cycle. Palbociclib inhibited 
thymidine incorporation into the DNA of a panel of RB-positive human breast, colon, lung and 
prostate cancers. Palbociclib wa s also effective in preventing cell cycle progre ssion in human 
leukemias and in nontransformed human epi[INVESTIGATOR_321538]. 
 
A selective CDK4/cyclinD inhibitor should cause a specific accu mulation of cells in G1, but have 
no effect on other phases of the cell cycle, in which cells sho uld continue to progress and eventually 
decline in number. MDA-MB-[ADDRESS_396862] carcinoma cells that were exposed to various 
concentrations of palbociclib for 24 hours show a  significant i ncrease in the percentage of cells in 
G1 in the presence of as little as 0.04 M palbociclib with a concomitant decline in other phases 
of the cell cycle. Similar resu lts were obtained in panels of p rostate cancer cell lines.[ADDRESS_396863] deleted RB. The compound had no anti-
proliferative activity on the se cells when assayed at 3 M (highest concentration tested), which is 
1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the concentration necess ary to inhibit RB-positive tumor 
cells. 
 
Nonclinical Activity 
 
The MTD in SCID mice was 150 mg/kg/day when administered orally , once a day, for [ADDRESS_396864] dose that was nonlethal (<LD 10). At the MTD on this 
regimen, palbociclib has significant antitumor efficacy against  multiple human tumor xenograft 
models (including the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line). The Colo-205 model is exquisitely sensitive 
to palbociclib. At doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg, a 13-day growth delay was obtained, indicating a 
90% inhibition of tumor growth ra te. Further evidence that the anti-tumor activity observed in RB-
positive tumors is due to inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 protein kinas e activity was obtained by [CONTACT_321595]-MB-[ADDRESS_396865] carcinoma and the DU-145 p rostate tumor models. These 
are RB-negative tumors; and neither responded to this compound. The lack of efficacy in RB-negative tumors is consistent with the lack of anti-proliferati ve activity observed in vitro. Taken 
together, these results support the proposed mechanism of palbo ciclib (inhibition of CDK4/6-
mediated RB phosphorylation) and the specificity of the compound demonstrated in enzyme activity tests. 
 
14 
  
Nonclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology 
 
Dosing Schedules:  Further studi es investigated whether continu ous daily dosing of palbociclib 
was needed for optimal efficacy. Four dosing schedules were emp loyed against the MDA-MB-
[ADDRESS_396866] day, and 3 courses of 3 days dosing followed b y 4-day drug holidays. The design 
of this experiment was such th at the total compound administered over the 2-week period was 
identical for each treatment schedule. The results show that a similar degree of efficacy was 
attained with all schedules, implying that an intermittent regi men is feasible without compromising 
activity.  
 
Inhibition of RB Phosphorylation:   To determine if palbociclib prevented RB phosphorylation, 
efficacious and non-efficacious doses  of palbociclib were given to mice bearing the MDA-MB-
[ADDRESS_396867] carcinoma and the phosphorylation status of serine-780 on RB in tumor tissue was monitored over time. The results show that while all doses caus ed a reduction in the biomarker 
shortly after drug administrati on, phosphorylation returned at the non-efficacious  doses (12.5 and 
37.5 mg/kg) over the 24-hour interval before the next dose. How ever, the highly efficacious dose 
of 150 mg/kg suppressed RB seri ne-[ADDRESS_396868] Colo-205 tumors (i.e., r egression), total inhibition ha d to be maintained.  
 
Comparing results of the efficacy experiments between the highl y sensitive colon tumor and the 
moderately sensitive breast tumor reveals a 7 to 8-fold differe nce in the dose necessary to produce 
comparable efficacy. The pharmacodynamic results show a similar  difference between the 2 
tumors in dose requirements necessary to suppress serine-780 ph osphorylation on RB, indicating 
that efficacy correlates with modulation of this biomarker. Ki- 67, a common marker of cell 
proliferation, was monitored in xenografts by [CONTACT_321596]-1 
antibody. MDA-MB-435 and Colo-205 xenografts were treated with an efficacious but nontoxic 
dose of palbociclib (130 mg/kg) daily for [ADDRESS_396869] dose, RB 
phosphorylation and Ki-67 returned to control levels in MDA-MB- 435. In Colo-205, RB 
phosphorylation and Ki-67 expressi on remained partly suppressed  through 72 hours. These results 
are consistent with the anti-proliferative mechanism expected f or a specific Cdk4/[ADDRESS_396870] 7 ongoing 
trials in humans; 19 phase 1 trials (solid tumors and hematolog ic malignancy) , three phase 1/2

Phase 1 Experience and MTD Determination.  74 patients with a v ariety of solid tumors were 
treated as part of the Phase 1 t rial.  41 patients received palbociclib on a 3-week on, 1-week off 
treatment schedule (3/1) with doses ranging from 25 to 150 mg o ne daily.  An additional 33 patients 
received daily treatment with 2-week on/1-week off schedule (2/1) at a similar dose range.  The MTD doses for Phase 2 investigations was determined to be 125mg  daily for the 3/1 schedule and 
200mg daily for the 2/1 schedule.  Common adverse events relate d to treatment are listed in Section 
3.1 and included fatigue, neutrope nia, nausea, diarrhea, and an emia.

The Phase 1 portion of the study has completed accrual with 12 patients. In the Ph ase 2 portion of 
the study, patients were randomized to receive either letrozole  2.5 mg QD alone or palbociclib 125

Cancer.  In this ongoing study 666 patients were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial to receive either palbociclib 125mg QD (Schedule 3/1) + l etrozole or letrozole alone. The 
most common treatment related a dverse events were neutropenia ( 41.6%), fatigue (28.5%), nausea

via up regulation of cyclin D which complexes with the kinase CDK4/6, resulting in phosphorylation of RB which in turn drives G1/S progression (Fig 3).  Although most early stage prostate cancers retain wild-type RB function, perturbations in this pathway (loss of RB, upregulation of cyclin D) are felt to 
promote castration-resistance.    Preclinical data demonstrated that PD 0332991 (Palbociclib) inhibited proliferation and promoted G1 arrest in an RB and Cyclin D-dependent manner in prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts.
[ADDRESS_396879] RB function with palbociclib.  Currently, the rates of RB loss or mutation (as measured by [CONTACT_321597]) ranges between roughly 1-20% in localized prostate can cer (1% for 2 copy deletion versus 
10-20% for 1 copy deletion)
15 to 30-40% in heavily treated metastatic castration-resistant p rostate 
cancer16. The reported rates of loss of RB protein expression, by [CONTACT_321598], range 
from 0% in prostatectomy series17 to 40% in primary (TURP) tum or specimens in CRPC patients 
(unpublished data, Karen Knudsen, Thomas Jefferson University) to 70% in metastases in CRPC 
patients.7  Although, there is little data examining RB loss in the hormo ne sensitive metastatic 
population we aim to study here, by [CONTACT_321599] d ata, we hypothesize the rate to be 
between 10-20%. 
 
We hypothesize that the addition of palbociclib to initial ADT in patients with newly metastatic 
RB-positive prostate cancer may significantly increase the efficacy of ADT.   We postulate that 
similar to the Phase II trial of palbociclib in breast cancer, responses and survival could be 
predicated on retention of wild-type RB function.  To assess this, we are conducting this 
randomized phase II study of palbociclib in which patients with newly diagnosed mHSPC and RB-expressing tumors based on metastatic disease biopsy will be ra ndomized (1:2) to ADT or ADT 
plus palbociclib.  We propose to use confirmed PSA response (< 4 ng/mL) after 
28 weeks  o f  
therapy as the primary endpoint because it is an intermediate e ndpoint that correlates significantly 
with overall survival in hormone-sensitive patients.18,19

 2.6 Correlative Studies Background and Rationale   
 Targeted Analysis of Potential Predictive Biomarkers
.   
As part of the patient selection for this trial, patients will undergo a metastatic disease biopsy which 
will be tested by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) for total RB statu s in a CLIA certi fied laboratory.[ADDRESS_396880] of oncogen ic (e.g., cyclin D1 or cyclin D1B 
overexpression/amplification) or tumor suppressive (e.g., p16in k4a silencing) alterations. As 
previous studies from our group have defined a signature [CONTACT_321645], key RB target genes (such as Cyclin A and MCM7) will be assessed as potential biomarkers of response.
[ADDRESS_396881] could modulate the response to 
commonly used therapeutic regimens.  While the potential biomarkers to be assessed in the correlativ e studies (i.e., p16, cyclin D1B, 
E2F1, etc) may modulate, interact with, or be an effector of th e RB pathway, each of these 
biomarkers is not completely specific for the RB pathway, and t herefore will be assessed as in 
secondary (correlative studies) instead of being included in th e primary eligibility criteria.  For 
example, in the case of p16, while RB deficiency causes p16 ove rexpression, many other biological 
processes (aside from RB deficiency) also cause p16 overexpress ion.  In general, it appears that 
p16 overexpression is twice as common as RB deficiency. In trip le negative breast cancers, there 
is a 25% chance of RB deficiency, but a 50% chance of p16 overexpression.
20  In prostate cancers, 
the rate of RB deficiency is estimated to be <10% in the mHSPC population.  However, a study 
using thousands of localized prostate cancer specimens (primari ly including Gleason 6/7 disease) 
showed that there was a 20% cha nce of p16 overexpression in thi s population,[ADDRESS_396882] 20% or hig her in the newly metastatic 
population. Therefore, given the fact that p16 is regulated by [CONTACT_321600], and p16 
overexpression is approximately twice as common as RB loss, the  status of p16 and other RB 
modulators/interactors/effector s will be assessed in the correl ative studies but will not be used to 
exclude patients up front.  
  
Analysis for Additional Predictive  Biomarkers using Genomic Met hods.   To further uncover 
predictive markers, we will also perform targeted sequencing an d expression profiling on biopsy 
tissues. Genes commonly mutated in prostate cancer, those defin ing basic molecular subtypes, and 
those potentially related to RB will be assessed for point muta tions, short insertions/deletions 
[indels] as well as copy number alterations. Transcriptome sequ encing and/or qPCR will also be 
performed to assess expression of AR signaling, proliferation, molecular subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_321539]-related genes. Given the challenges of  routinely assessing metastatic s ites, we will also perform the same 
sequencing on diagnostic specimens to determine concordance bet ween transcriptome/genome 
alterations in primary and metastatic samples. We hypothesize t hat there may be many additional 
molecular events which determine whether prostate cancers will respond to palbociclib. In 
[ADDRESS_396883] biomarker-strati fied randomized trials for patients 
with metastatic castration-resi stant disease (NCI 9012), entitled "A Randomized Gene Fusion 
Stratified Phase 2 Trial Of Abiraterone With Or Without ABT888 For Patients With Metastatic 
Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer."  In the context of this trial, >70 biopsies (stored frozen) of 
metastatic disease were performed over the past 1.5 years, with  an 80% success rate of determining 
the status of the biomarker of interest.     
 While comprehensive sequenci ng studies have been performed in the context of locally advanced 
prostate cancer
22 as well as metastatic end-stage castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC),[ADDRESS_396884] been, to our knowledge, no such studies in the conte xt of metastatic hormone-sensitive 
prostate cancer.  Thus, by [CONTACT_321601], 
t h i s  p r o j e c t  w i l l  p r o v i d e  a  s i g n i ficant contribution to our kno wledge regarding the genomic 
landscape of prostate cancer, by [CONTACT_321602], but hormone-sensitive, 
prostate cancer.  This data would represent an extremely valuab le resource, which could serve as 
a "baseline" for comparison to s ubsequent sequencing studies in  the CRPC space, as well as an 
opportunity to identify targetabl e biological concepts that may  drive prostate cancer progression. 
 Analysis of blood specimens for c irculating, cell-free tumor DN A  
Recently, it has been demonstrated that patients with a variety of advanced solid tumors shed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the c irculation and that mutations p resent in tumor tissue can be 
detected by [CONTACT_5019]-throughput seque ncing of cfDNA isolated from blood specimens.
23 This rapi[INVESTIGATOR_321540]-c alled "liquid biopsy", in which 
relevant genomic changes whic h currently need to be sought by b iopsy of metastatic sites could 
instead be assayed from a blood specimen. In the current study we will collect the matched blood 
specimens needed to evaluate the efficacy of this approach as a  surrogate for molecular analysis 
of tissue biopsy specimens. Once key predictive genomic biomark ers are identified from the 
tissue biopsy analyses above, t hey can be assayed in blood as w ell to determine concordance 
between blood and metastatic tissu e biopsy. Given that optimal methods for cfDNA analysis are 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_92311], we plan to use th e most current, robust techn ologies available when the time 
comes for analysis of the collected cfDNA specimens. 
 
Analysis for Additional Predictive Biomarkers in Circulating Tu mor Cells 
Assessment of circulating tumor cells potentially represents a “liquid biopsy” approach with the 
potential for identifying biomar kers of treatment response.  To enumerate and characterize 
circulating tumor cells in this study, we will utilize a platfo rm developed by [CONTACT_321603], which has previously been described.24-[ADDRESS_396885] for 
longer-term PSA responses, and wi ll explore this hypothesis in this study.

information in the patient diary .  Patients should take palboci clib with food.  Patients will take 
medication daily for 21 days of a 28 day cycle. 
 Metabolism:  The ability of cytochrome P450 enzymes to metabolize palbocicl ib   was 
evaluated by [CONTACT_321604] (6 M) with the 5 major cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). CYP3A4 was the only 
enzyme that metabolized palbociclib. Concordantly, metabolism o f palbociclib (6 M) in 
human liver microsomes was significantly reduced (>80% decrease ) in the presence of the 
CYP3A4 enzyme-specific inhibitor ketoconazole (1 M). These data indicate that CYP3A 
enzymes are the primary enzymes responsible for the metabolism of palbociclib. 
   
Potential Drug Interactions:  Palbociclib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4.  
Coadministration with strong CY P3A4 inhibitors or inducers may significantly change 
plasma concentrations in humans.  Therefore the concurrent  use of strong inhibitors such 
as amprenavir, atazanavir, boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivapt an, delavirdine, 
diltiazem, erythromycin, fosamp renavir, indinavir, itraconazole , ketoconazole, 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], mibefradil, miconazol e, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posa conazole, ritonavir, 
[ADDRESS_396886]. John’s wort are not allowed. 
 
Excretion:   The excretion balance of radio activity and radioactivity conc entration in the 
collected plasma and blood sample s were evaluated following ora l administration of [14C] 
palbociclib (ethanesulfonic salt ) to intact and bile-duct cannu lated (BDC) male and female 
Sprague-Dawley rats at the dose level of 50 mg/kg as salt. The radioactive dose was mainly 
eliminated via the feces (>82%) with minor contribution of urin ary excretion (7.8%). The 
percentage of dose eliminated in bile within 72 hours after dos ing was 53% in male and 
82% in female BDC rats, suggesting that biliary excretion is th e major route of elimination 
in rats.   Toxicology:   The primary palbociclib toxicities in preclinical studies are  to the bone 
marrow, lymphoid tissues, and test es. These toxicities occurred in both rats and dogs, and 
are consistent with cell cycle inhibition produced by [CONTACT_321605]. Bone marrow pancytopenia re sulted in decreases in various  hematology parameters; 
however, the changes were reversible following cessation of dos ing. Reversible 
myelosuppression is anticipated in clinical studies and may be dose-limiting. Palbociclib 
demonstrated a potential for aneugenicity in the in vitro and i n vivo micronucleus assays. 
Acute IV administration of palbociclib to anesthetized dogs res ulted in significant 
pulmonary effects, including apnea, which were reversible. Effects were transient, appeared related to peak plasma concentrations (>2040 ng/mL), a nd consistent with 
centrally-mediated respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. No changes in pulmon ary function occurred at 
plasma drug concentrations <414 ng/mL. Pulmonary changes were o bserved in rats to 
which palbociclib was administer ed orally, which included rales , dyspnea, and atrophy of 
tracheal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. The clinical relevance of these effects is  unknown. Results of the 
Purkinje fiber and hERG in vitr o assays and cardiovascular stud y in dogs have indicated a 
potential for prolongatio n of the QT interval  
 Additional routine studies in ra ts revealed that palbociclib co uld alter glucose metabolism 
and affect the pancreas, eye, teeth, kidney and adipose tissue of some rats. Hyperglycemia, 
glycosuria and pancreatic islet cell changes were observed.  So me rats developed cataracts 
(clouding of the eye lens) after being given palbociclib for 6 months.  It is currently 
unknown what these findings mean f or patients treated with palb ociclib over time. 
 
Pharmacokinetics in Humans:    
 
As of [ADDRESS_396887] evalua ted the PK of 
palbociclib.  Four of these tri als were conducted in patients w ith advanced malignant 
disease.  Seventeen Phase 1 cli nical pharmacology and biopharmaceutic studies of 
palbociclib were conducted in healthy subjects.  Ten of these 17 clinical trials were 
clinical pharmacology studies condu cted to investigate the abso rption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion of palbociclib as well as examine the  potential for a drug-drug 
interaction (DDI) with palbociclib.  The remaining [ADDRESS_396888] of the palbociclib formulations.   
21 
  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from patients with advanced cancer from Study A5481001 indicate that the plasma pharm acokinetics of palbociclib are lo w to moderately variable 
with generally dose proportional exposures over the dose range evaluated (25 mg to 225 
mg) following single and multiple doses.  PK data from Studies A5481001, A5481003, 
and A5481010 indicate that palbocic lib is slowly absorbed with a median time of 
maximum concentration (T
max) between [ADDRESS_396889]-dose, and is slowly 
eliminated with an elimination half-life (t 1/2) ranging from 23.2 hours to 28.8 hours.  
Palbociclib accumulates after repeated daily dosing (median Rac ranged from 1.9 to 2.4), which was consistent with its terminal t
1/2. In Study A5481010, the median R ss (the 
predicted accumulation to estim ate linearity) was 1.1, indicati ng that palbociclib 
clearance does not change  over time.  In Study A5481003, palboc iclib was shown to 
achieve steady-state concentra tions following 8 days of QD dosi ng.  The palbociclib 
geometric mean volume of distribution (V z/F) was [ADDRESS_396890] cancer (Study A5481003), which is significantly greater than total body water (42 
L), indicating that palbociclib ext ensively distributes to peri pheral tissues. 
 In humans, metabolism is the major route of elimination of palb ociclib. Following a 
single oral administration of [
14C]palbociclib to healthy subjects (Study A5481011), the 
overall median recovery of the ad ministered radioactivity in th e excreta was 91.6% with a 
median of 17.5% recovered in urine and a median of 74.1% recove red in feces.  
Excretion of unchanged palbociclib in the feces and urine was 2 .3% and 6.9% of dose, 
respectively, indicating that exc retion plays a minor role in e limination of palbociclib.  A 
study in healthy volunteers (A5481015)  indicated that the absol ute oral bioavailability of 
palbociclib was approximately 46%.    
In vitro data indicate that CYP3A and SULT enzyme SULT2A1 are mainly involved in 
the metabolism of palbociclib.  Pal bociclib is a weak time-depe ndent inhibitor of CYP3A 
following daily 125 mg dosing to steady state in humans.  In vi tro, palbociclib is not an 
inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6, and is not an inducer of 
CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 3A4 at clini cally relevant concentrations . 
 
In vitro evaluations indicated t hat palbociclib has a low poten tial to inhibit the activities 
of drug transporters P-glycoprot ein (P-gp), breast cancer resis tance protein (BCRP), 
organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)2, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, and bile sal t export pump 
(BSEP) at clinically relevant concentrations.  An itraconazole DDI study in healthy volunteers (Study A5481016) and a rifampin DDI study in healthy volunteers (Study A 5481017) were conducted to evaluate the potential 
for strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers, respectively, to alte r the PK of palbociclib. 
Coadministration of itraconazole  and palbociclib increased palbociclib AUC
inf and C max 
by [CONTACT_3450] 87% and 34%, resp ectively, relative to those w hen palbociclib dose 
was given alone.  Coadministration of rifampin and palbociclib decreased palbociclib 
AUC inf and C max by [CONTACT_3450] 85% and 70%, respe ctively, relative to palboc iclib 
given alone.  Based on this data, t he concurrent administration  of strong CYP3A 
inhibitors and inducers wit h palbociclib should be avoided. 
22 
  
A midazolam DDI study in heal thy volunteers (Study A5481012) wa s conducted to 
evaluate the potential for pal bociclib to act as a time-depende nt inhibitor of  CYP3A4/5 at 
steady-state.  Plasma midazolam C max and AUC inf values increased 37% and 61%, 
respectively, when single oral doses of midazolam were co-admin istered with multiple 
doses of palbociclib as compared to its administration alone. T his is consistent with weak 
time-dependent CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_396891] ered as the commercial 
free base capsule was evaluat ed in healthy subjects (A5481021).   Compared to 
palbociclib given under overnight fasted conditions, the AUC
inf and C max of palbociclib 
increased by 21% and 38% when given with high-fat food, by 12% and 27% when given 
with low-fat food, and by 13% and 24%  when moderate-fat food wa s given [ADDRESS_396892] v ariability of palbociclib exposu re.  Based on these results, 
palbociclib commercial free base capsules should be taken with food. 
 The solubility of the palbociclib free base is pH dependent—pal bociclib is water soluble 
at low pH (2.1-4.5), while the s olubility dramatically decrease s as pH rises above 4.5.  
Concomitant administration of age nts which increase gastric pH can alter the solubility 
and absorption of palbocicli b free base formulations.  
 In a drug interaction trial i n healthy subjects (A5481038), coa dministration of a single 
125 mg dose of commercial free base capsule with multiple doses  of the proton pump 
inhibitors (PPI) rabeprazole  under fed conditions decreased pal bociclib C
max by 41%, but 
had limited impact on AUC inf (13% decrease), when compared to a single dose of 
palbociclib administered alone .  Given the reduced effect on ga stric pH of H2-receptor 
antagonists and local antacids compared to PPIs, the effect of these classes of acid-
reducing agents on palbociclib e xposure under fed conditions is expected to be minimal.  
Under fed conditions there is no c linically relevant effect of PPIs, H2-receptor 
antagonists, or local antaci ds on palbociclib exposure.  In ano ther healthy subject study, 
coadministration of a single dose  of commercial free base capsu le with multiple doses of 
the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_321541] C max by 
62% and 80%, respectively, when c ompared to a single dose of pa lbociclib administered 
alone.  Collectively, these antac id DDI data further support th e requirement that the free 
base capsule of palbociclib should be taken with food.  
23 
 Based on a population pharmacokine tic analysis in 183 patients with cancer (50 male and 
133 female patients, age ra nge from 22 to 89 years, and body weight range from 37.9 to 
123 kg), gender had no effect on the exposure of palbociclib, and age and body weight 
had no clinically important effect  on the exposure of palbocicl ib. 
 Based on a population pharmacokinetic  analysis that included 18 3 patients, where 40 
patients had mild hepatic impairm ent (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and  AST > ULN, or total 
bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any A ST), mild hepatic impairme nt had no effect on the 
exposure of palbociclib.  The pharm acokinetics of palbociclib h ave not been studied in 
patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bili rubin >1.5 × ULN and any 
AST).  Based on a population pharmacokinetic  analysis that included 18 3 patients, where 73 
patients had mild renal impairmen t (60 mL/min ≤ CrCl <90 mL/min ) and 29 patients had 
moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min ≤ CrCl <60 mL/min), mild a nd moderate renal 
impairment had no effect on the exp osure of palbociclib.  The p harmacokinetics of 
palbociclib have not been studied  in patients with severe renal  impairment. 
 A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis to evaluate the relationship between 
palbociclib exposure and ECG endpoi nts (RR and QTc intervals) w ere developed using 
pooled data from 3 clinical trials in patients with advanced ma lignant disease (Studies 
A5481001, A5481002, and A5481003).  The s tudy population consis ted of 48 men and 
136 women with a median (rang e) body weight of 73.0 (37.9-123) kg and age of 
61.5 (22-89) years old.  Palbociclib  doses ranged from 25 mg to 225 mg QD.  The data 
collected from 184 patients cons isted of 569 ECG-palbociclib co ncentration-matched 
pairs; the observed plasma concentrations had a median (range) of 55.2 (2.51-329) 
ng/mL.  The average heart rate, RR, QT, QT corrected for heart rate according to Bazett 
(QTcB), QT corrected for heart ra te according to Fridericia (QTcF), and QTcS (QT 
interval corrected for heart rate according to a study-specific  correction factor) at baseline 
for ECG-palbociclib concentra tion matched data were 76.[ADDRESS_396893] on heart rate.  A slight positiv e linear relationship 
between palbociclib concentration and QTcS was observed; howeve r, at the mean or 
median steady-state palbociclib C
max following administra tion of the recommended 
clinical dose of palbociclib (125 mg QD) in patients with cance r, the upper bound of the 
one-sided 95% CI for the increase in QTcS fell below the thresh old of 10 msec, 
suggesting that QT prolongation is  not a safety concern for palbociclib at the 
recommended clinical dose according to the criteria described i n the ICH guidance for 
Industry E14.  Similar results wer e obtained when QTcF and QTcB  were used.

indicated that the glucuronide c onjugate of palbociclib and the  lactam of palbociclib (PF-
05089326) were the main metabolites  present in pla sma. Other me tabolites observed were 
the glucuronide conjugates of hydroxylated palbociclib and the glucuronide conjugate of 
24 
 reduced palbociclib. PF-05089326 was also observed in the circu lation of rats following 
repeated daily oral administration of palbociclib at the dose l evels of 50 and 100 
mg/kg/day. 
 
Safety and Adverse Events: 
 
Phase 1 Trials:13,[ADDRESS_396894] frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (>20% of 
patients) of any grade, regardless of causality were fatigue (52.7% of patients); neutropenia (48.4%); nausea (35.2%); diarrhea and anemia (30.8% each); cons tipation (26.4%); 
decreased appetite (22.0%); and vomiting and thrombocytopenia (20.9% each). The most frequently reported TEAEs (>20% of patients) of any grade that were considered to be 
related to the study treatment were neutropenia (46.2% of patie nts); fatigue (45.1%); 
diarrhea and anemia (25.3% each); and nausea (24.2%). 
 
The most frequently reported Grade > or = 3 TEAEs, all causalit y, were neutropenia 
(30.8% of patients); anemia (9.9%); leukopenia (7.7%); fatigue (6.6%); and dyspnea and 
disease progression (5.5% each). Grade 3 neutropenia was consid ered to be related to the 
study treatment for 22.0% of patients. Grade 3 leukopenia and t hrombocytopenia were each 
considered related to treatment in 5.5% of patients. 
 
The most frequently reported Grad e 4 TEAEs were neutropenia (6 patients; all considered 
to be related to the study treatment) and thrombocytopenia (3 p atients; considered to be 
related to study treatment for 2 patients). Grade 4 leukopenia was reported for 2 patients 
and Grade 4 anemia, pulmonary embolism, increased blood uric ac id, decreased 
hemoglobin level and hyperglycemia for 1 patient each. Grade 5 events were reported for 
8 patients and included disease progression (5 patients), cardi ac arrest (2 patients) and 
failure to thrive (1 patient). N o Grade 5 event was considered to be related to palbociclib. 
 Phase 1/2  Trial:
14 
In the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_396895] frequently reported TEAEs (>20 % of patients) of any grade, 
regardless of causality were neut ropenia (71.6% of the patients); leukopenia (41.1%); 
fatigue (40.0%); nausea (27.4%); anemia (26.3%); diarrhea (22.1 %); and arthralgia and hot 
flush (20.0% each). All reports of neutropenia and leukopenia w ere considered to be related 
to the study treatment. Fatigue and anemia were considered to be related to the study treatment for 25.3% of patients each, nausea for 18.9%, hot flu sh for 17.9%, and arthralgia 
for 16.8%. The most frequently reported Grade 3 TEAEs were neutropenia (53.7% of patients) and leukopenia (17.9% o f patients). All reports of neutropenia and leukopenia 
were considered to be related to the study treatment. The most frequently reported Grade 
4 TEAEs were neutropenia (6.3% of patients; all considered to b e related to study 
treatment), fatigue and pulmonary embolism (2.1% of patients ea ch; all considered to be 
unrelated to treatment). As of the 01 September 2012 cutoff, on e Grade 5 event (disease 
progression considered unrelate d to study treatment) was report ed. 
 Duration of Toxicity: 
An exploratory analysis assessi ng the duration of neutropenia a nd thrombocytopenia 
during the first [ADDRESS_396896] cycle 
dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were noted, 5 for patients on S chedule 3/1 and 6 for patients 
on Schedule 2/1. All DLTs consisted of neutropenia and/or throm bocytopenia and most 
were categorized as a DLT due to the need for a treatment inter ruption of longer than 7 
days’ duration. Febrile neutropenia was not reported as a DLT.  
 Effect on QT interval: 
The results of analysis of [ADDRESS_396897] on the hea rt rate.  There  was a possible relationship 
between palbociclib and QTc although the increase fell below th e threshold of 10 msec 
suggesting that QT prolongation is not a major safety concern at the recommended doses.

3.2  Bicalutamide (Casodex®) (NSC-722665) 
 
28 
 General:    Bicalutamide is an active non-steriodal antiandrogen a nd its antiandr ogen activity 
resides exclusively in the (-) or (R) enantiomer. Unlike flutam ide, it is peripherally selective 
and does not cause a rise in serum LH or Testosterone in male rats and dogs. This peripheral 
selectivity may be because it penetrates poorly the CNS and Hyp othalamus (the site of negative 
feedback of androgens). In humans, rises in LH, Testosterone an d Estradiol concentrations 
were seen. These rises were not dose related. In 90%, testoster one levels remained within 
normal limits. There was no significant rise in mean serum FSH.   
 Chemistry:  Bicalutamide is a racemic mixture containing two enantiomers, (2RS)-4'-Cyano-
3(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydrox y-2-methyl-3'-trifluoromethyl) propi[INVESTIGATOR_290491]. 
 Toxicology:  In rats, besides antiandrogenic changes, there was evidence of  hepatocyte 
hypertrophy and basophilia. In dogs treated for 6 months, there  was increased heart rate with 
decreased PR interval, transient decrease in circulating PMNs a nd increased plasma 
cholesterol. No cardiac pathology was found. In a mouse oncogen icity study, an increased 
incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in the top d ose male group (75 
mg/kg/day). The no effect dose level for hepatocellular carcino m a  i n  t h i s  s t u d y  w a s  1 5  
mg/kg/day with steady state blood levels in excess of 10 μg/ml.  The mechanism for this tumor 
formation is a non-genotoxic, phenobarbitone-type MFO induction  and is not considered to 
represent a risk for humans. A t wo-year study in rats and femal e mice at similar 
doses did not show an increased incidence of hepatic tumors. Bi calutamide has been given to 
over 3,500 men in 35 different clinical studies worldwide, in d oses up to 600 mg daily. When 
bicalutamide is given in combina tion with an LHRH analog, the p harmacologic adverse event 
profile is dominated by [CONTACT_321606] d includes hot flashe s (53%), gynecomastia (9%) 
and breast pain (6%). Other advers e events reported regardless of 
causality included diarrhea (12%), constipation (22%), nausea (15%) and abdominal pain 
(11%). Other adverse were reported, such as fatigue (22%), pain (35%), back pain (25%), 
pelvic pain (21%), infection (18 %), peripheral edema (13%), dys pnea (13%), nocturia (12%), 
hematuria (12%), anemia (11%), dizziness (10%). Bicalutamide ha s been associated with 
changes in liver function, although these are infrequent (7%) a nd rarely occur with jaundice. 
Many of these changes improved or  resolved despi[INVESTIGATOR_321543]. 
There have been no reports of fat al hepatotoxicity associated w ith bicalutamide therapy. 
 PHARMACOLOGY: 
 Pharmacokinetics: Animal studies : After oral single dose administration, absorption of the 
compound was slow with peak con centration occurring 3 - 12 hour s and plateau between 
2 and 48 hours. There was non-proportional increase in plasma l evels with increasing 
doses. Elimination half-life ranges from 17 - 28 hours in male rats, 21 - 29 hours in female rats and 5 - 7.5 days in dogs. 91 - 96% of bicalutamide is boun d to plasma protein. Human 
studies: After single doses, mean time for peak plasma concentr ation was 6 hours at 10 and 
30 mg, but at 50 mg, it was 16 hours. Mean plasma elimination h alf-lives after 12 weeks 
of 10, 30, 50, 100 mg/day was 7 - 10 days. This finding was con sistent with single dose 
data. In patients given daily doses of 50 mg, mean plasma conce ntration was 10 µg/mL at 
12 weeks. After single doses, there was linear increase with do ses between 10 and 50 mg, 
but became non-linear at doses of 50 - 100 mg. At 100 mg, the o ral bioavailability is 
reduced by 30% but plasma elimination half-life is unchanged. B icalutamide is extensively 
metabolized and metabolites are excreted by [CONTACT_321607] d urinary system. 
29 
  
 Formulation: Bicalutamide is prepared as round, film-coated green or white tablets 
containing standard recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] a nd 50 mg of the drug. Storage a nd stability: All packages 
of bicalutamide should be stored  securely in a dry place at roo m temperature. 
 
 Route of Administration: Bicalutamide is to be administered in tablet form as a once-daily 
oral dose. Patients should be i nstructed to take one tablet onc e daily. 
 
 Supplier: Commercial supply of Bicalutamide will be used. Pleas e refer to the Physician 
Desk Reference and package insert for complete information. 
 
3.3 Goserelin acetate implant (Zoladex®) (NSC-606864) 
 
 PHARMACOLOGY  
 Mechanism of Action: Following initial administration in males,  goserelin causes an initial 
increase in serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimula ting hormone (FSH) levels 
with subsequent increases in serum levels of testosterone. Chro nic administration of 
goserelin leads to sustained suppression of pi[INVESTIGATOR_321544], and serum levels of 
testosterone consequently fall i n t o  t h e  r a n g e  n o r m a l l y  s e e n  i n  surgically castrated men 
approximately 2-4 weeks afte r initiation of therapy. 
 Absorption: Goserelin 3.[ADDRESS_396899] 8 days , and then rapid and 
continuous release for the remainder of the 28 day dosing perio d. Time to peak 
concentration for goserelin 3.6 mg is 12-15 days in males and 8 -22 days in females. 
Goserelin 10.8 mg exhibits an init ial rapid release resulting i n a peak concentration at 2 
hours after dosing. From Day 4 until the end of the 12-week dos ing interval, the sustained 
release of goserelin produces a r easonably stable systemic expo sure.  
 Distribution: Apparent volumes of distribution determined after  subcutaneous 
administration of 250 mcg aqueous solution of goserelin were 44.1 and 20.3 liters for males and females, respectively. Goser elin is approximately 27% prote in bound. 
 Metabolism: Metabolism of goserelin by [CONTACT_321608] C-term inal amino acids is the 
major clearance mechanism. The half-life elimination (t1/2)) is  approximately 4 hours in 
males and 2 hours in females.  
 Elimination: Clearance of goserelin is very rapid and occurs pr imarily via urinary excretion 
(>90%; 20% as unchanged drug).  
 Drug Interactions: Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog s may diminish the 
therapeutic effect of antidiabetic agents. No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been 
performed. Please refer to the current FDA-approved package ins ert for additional 
information.

  The FDA issued a safety communication in October 2010 based on  their ongoing safety review 
of LHRH agonists. The safety co mmunication discusses the potential for an increased risk of 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, sud den cardiac death, stroke) 
associated with these agents. The risk is thought to be low in men receiving LHRH agonists for 
prostate cancer. In this trial, LHRH agonists are being adminis tered for a short period of time. 
FDA recommendations include management of cardiovascular risk f actors according to current 
standards of practice.

 3.4 Leuprolide (Lupron Depot®) (NSC-377526) 
 
 PHARMACOLOGY  
 Mechanism of Action: Leuprolide inhibits gonadotropin secretion  by [CONTACT_321609]-releasing hor mone (LHRH) agonist. Continuou s administration 
results in suppression of ovari an and testicular steroidogenesi s due  to  decreased  levels  
of  LH  and  FSH  with  subsequent  decrease  in testosterone (male) and estrogen (female) levels. In males, testosterone levels are reduced to below cast rate levels. Leuprolide may 
also act directly on the testes as well as act by a different m echanism not directly related to 
reduction in serum testosterone. 
 Absorption: After the initial increase of leuprolide following each injection, mean serum 
concentrations remain relatively constant.  
 Distribution: The mean steady-state volume of distribution of l euprolide following 
intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was  27 L. In vitro binding to 
human plasma proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. 
 Metabolism: Upon   administrati on   with   differe nt   le uproli de   acetate formulations, the 
major metabolite of leuprolide acetate is a pentapeptide (M-I) metabolite.  
 Elimination: Less  than  5%  of  the  leuprolide  dose  was  re covered  as parent  and  M-I  
metabolite  in  the  urine  following  the  3.5  mg  depot inje ction.  
 Drug Interactions: Lute inizing hormone-releasing hormone analog s may diminish the    
therapeutic    effect    of    a ntidiabetic    agents.    No ph armacokinetic-based drug-drug   
interaction   studies   have   been performed. Because leuproli de is a peptide that is primarily 
degraded by [CONTACT_321610] P-450 enzymes and t he drug is only about 
46% protein bound, drug interacti ons would not be expected to occur.

started androgen depriv ation therapy for the treatment of their newly diagnosed metastatic 
disease are eligible as long as t he duration of treatment is le ss than or equal to 2 weeks (14 
days)
 prior to registration. The start date of androgen deprivation is considered the day the 
patient first received an injection of a LHRH agonist/antagonis t (or orchiectomy), not the 
date when an oral antiandrogen started.  
36 
  Patients must have a minimum PSA ≥ 5 ng/mL within [ADDRESS_396902]  started androgen deprivation 
therapy. 
 
 Agree to undergo a biopsy of at least one metastatic site for R B status evaluation 
(Please refer to Appendices B and C for specific procedures ).  Adequate metastatic tissue 
from prior biopsy/resection ca n be used if available in lieu of  a biopsy.   
 
 ECOG performance status of 0-2.   
  Age ≥ 18 years.   
  Patients may have received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant ho rmonal therapy for 
non-metastatic disease including in combination with salvage ra diation therapy for PSA 
relapse, but it must not have lasted for more than [ADDRESS_396903] 
elapsed since completion of androgen deprivation therapy in the  neoadjuvant and/or 
adjuvant setting.

that is approved by [CONTACT_51277]. 
 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria 
 
37 
  Patients who have received androgen deprivation therapy for gre ater than 14 days 
(LHRH-agonist or antagonist) for the treatment of their newly d iagnosed metastatic 
disease prior to enrollment ar e not eligible for this study. 
 
 Patients who are currently being treated with strong CYP3A4 inh ibitors (e.g., 
amprenavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], 
mibefradil, miconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, r itonavir, saquinavir, 
telaprevir, telithromycin, verapamil, voriconazole, and grapefr uit) or strong CYP3A 
inducers (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], felbamate, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarb ital, phenytoin, 
primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentin and St. John’s wort)  must either discontinue 
these drugs or are ineligible. 
 
 Grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTc  >500 msec on two separate ECGs).  
  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from th is clinical trial 
because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic 
dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic an d other adverse events. 
  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to , ongoing or active 
infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure ([LOCATION_001] Heart  Association Class III 
and IV heart failure), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhyt hmia, or psychiatric 
illness/social situations that would limit compliance with stud y requirements. 
 
 Patients with a "currently active" second malignancy other than  non-melanoma skin 
cancers are not eligible. Patients are not considered to have a  "currently active" 
malignancy if they have completed all therapy and are now considered without 
evidence of disease for 1 year.  
 
 HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are  ineligible because of 
the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with palbociclib .  In addition, these 
patients are at increased risk of  lethal infections when treate d with marrow-suppressive 
therapy.

tumor histology should be sent. A total of [ADDRESS_396910] volume of representative tumor histology should be sent . 
41 
   If unstained sections are sent, they should be labeled with th e block number/letter. If 
less than three blocks have cancer, then as many unstained 4-5 micron sections (up to 
15) as can be cut from blocks w ith cancer without exhaustion sh ould be sent.   
  
5.4       Data Management 
All information will be recorded  locally and entered into Case Report Forms (CRFs) on  
the web-based Velos data management system of the University of  Michigan. Online 
access will be provided to each site by [CONTACT_5081] .  
 
CRFs will be reviewed and source  verified by [CONTACT_321618]. D iscrepant, unusual and incomp lete data will be queried  
by [CONTACT_43907]. The investigator or study coordinator will be respo nsible for providing 
resolutions to the data queries, as appropriate. The investigator must ensure that all data 
queries are dealt with promptly.   The data submission schedule is as follows:  
 At the time of registration   
o Subject entry into Velos 
o Subject Status 
o Demographics 
 During study participation 
o All data should be entered on line within [ADDRESS_396911] ed periodically either by [CONTACT_70963] r eview or by [CONTACT_321619]. All study information should be r ecorded in an appropriate sour ce document (e.g. clinic 
chart).  
  
6. STRATIFICATION, RANDOMI ZATION AND TREATMENT PLAN  
       
6.1        Stratification and Randomization    
 Stratification:  All patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_321620]-registra tion for M1 
disease (yes versus no) and disease extent defined as limited ( disease confined to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
pelvic bones and or lymph nodes)  or extensive (ribs, long bones , or visceral organs with or 
without other sites). 
 
Randomization:  All eligible patients with RB-positive tumor will be randomly  assigned 
(1:2) to receive ADT (LHRH agonist + biclutamide) alone (ARM 1)  or ADT plus 
palbociclib (ARM 2).    
 
42 
 6.2       Agent Administration  
 Patients will only be eligible for protocol therapy if the meta static disease biopsy 
or prior metastatic disease biops y/resection tissue has adequat e tumor tissue for RB 
analysis and the tissue is RB positive.  
 
 Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reporte d adverse events 
and potential risks are described in Section 3.  Appropriate dose modifications are 
described in Section 7. No inves tigational or commercial agents  or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_221]'s 
malignancy. 
 
 In both Arms androgen deprivation therapy should be administere d after the biopsy 
is done, unless androgen deprivati on was started prior to regis tration. 
 
 In Arm [ADDRESS_396912] randomization  as soon as agent 
is available (within 7 working days  from randomization in case  time for drug 
shipment is needed)  
 
 
  
 
 
    
  
           
   
*LHRH-analogue: Either gosere lin or leuprolide dosing to be determined at discretion of 
treating physician. 
** Palbociclib : 125 mg to be taken daily for 21 days with 7 days off during a  28 day cycle.  
Drug should be taken with food.   Arm 1 Treatment

  For patients who have not started ADT D1 is the day palbociclib   + LHRH-a or 
LHRH-a therapy (based on randomization) is started.    
 For patients who have started ADT D1 will be the day of randomization.  “D1 
exam, labs and correlative studies” must be done within 7 worki ng days from 
randomization.  All subsequent labs, imaging and endpoints will  be counted 
from this day.  
 For subsequent cycles, the formal “Day 1” of each cycle is defi ned as the day 
that Palbociclib dosing resumes. 
 Patients will continue treatment until disease progression or o ther reason for   
discontinuation of protocol treatment. 
 Patient Diary: Bicalutamide and palbociclib compliance will be recorded on the 
Patient Diary (see Appendix G a nd H). Institutional staff will review and ascertain 
patient adherence with protocol treatment. If a dose of either agent is missed, 
patients are to take the normal dose on the following day.  If more than one daily 
dose is missed, the study doctor  or study team must be informed . 
 General rules for palboc iclib administration: 
o Palbociclib should be taken with food. 
o Palbociclib capsules should be swallowed whole (do NOT chew, cr ush or 
open them prior to swallowing). 
o No capsule should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or othe rwise not 
intact. 
o Patients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximate ly the same 
time each day. 
o Patients who miss a day’s dose entirely must be instructed NOT to “make 
it up” the next day. 
o Patients who vomit any time after taking a dose must be instructed NOT to “make it up,” and to resume treatme nt the next day as prescribed. 
o Patients who inadvertently take [ADDRESS_396913] be 
instructed to skip t he next day’s dose.  
 6.3  General Concomitant Medicat ion, Treatment and Supportive C are Guidelines  
 
 Patients may continue on a daily Multi-Vitamin, calcium and Vit amin D, but all other 
herbal, alternative and food supplements (i.e. PC-Spes, Saw Pal metto, St John’s Wort, 
etc.) must be discontinued before registration.    
 Patients may not receive any othe r investigational anticancer a gents (besides  stu
 dy drug 
and ADT) for this stage of disease. Patients may not undergo co ncurrent radiation 
therapy.  
 Other excluded treatments incl ude chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and 
radiopharmaceuticals or any other therapy intended to treat prostate cancer. 
 
 In case participants develop nausea/vomiting/diarrhea or myelos uppression, supportive 
medications will be allowed according to institutional standard s.  
 
44 
  Because there is a potential for interaction of palbociclib wit h other concomitantly 
administered drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, the medi cal record must 
capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over-the-counter  medications, or 
alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The Princ ipal Investigator ([CONTACT_321647])  should be alerted if the 
patient is taking any agent known to affect or with the potenti al to affect selected 
CYP450 isoenzymes and the agent should be discontinued or situa tion discussed with 
her.   
 
 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes  (non-comprehensive list):  
 
Patients are not eligible if they are taking one of the agents below.  Similarly if any of 
these agents has to be started for patients randomized to the p albociclib arm then 
patients must come off treatment .  Patients will be followed fo r progression. 
 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: amprenavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir,  itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], mibefradil, miconazole, nefazodone, ne lfinavir, 
posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin,  verapamil, 
voriconazole, and grapefruit 
 Strong CYP3A4  inducers: carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], felbamate, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentin and St. John’s wort. 
 
 Transfusions and hematologic growth factors are allowed in acco rdance with 
institutional guidelines. 
 
6.4  Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), tre atment may continue until 
one of the following c riteria applies: 
 
 Disease progression (d efined in section 11), 
 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of tr eatment, 
 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s) (see sections 3 and 8),  
 
 Therapy delay for more than 4 weeks, 
 
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, 
 
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render t he patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the inves tigator. 
  
45 
 6.5     Duration of Follow Up  
 
 Patients removed from study treatment for progression will be f ollowed for 4 weeks or 
resolution/stabilization of any t herapy related a dverse events.     
 
 Once off study treatment for any reason other than progression,  follow-up visits will be 
done every 12 weeks.  These visits will include H&P and laborat ory assessment 
(CBCPD, Chemistry, PSA).  Imaging will be done q [ADDRESS_396914].  
 
 Patients removed from study treatment for unacceptable adverse event(s) may be 
followed more frequently than every 12 weeks per the investigator’s discretion until resolution or stabilizatio n of the adverse event. 
   
7. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
 This study will utilize the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Crite ria for Adverse 
Events) Version 4.0 for toxicity and Serious Adverse Event repo rting.  A copy of the 
CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov).  All appropriate treatment areas shou ld have access to a copy 
of the CTCAE Version 4.0.  
 Toxicities (including suspected reactions) that meet the seriou s reporting criteria as 
outlined in section 8.[ADDRESS_396915] Manager  and to the IRB per local IRB requirements. 
 
 For treatment or dose modificat ion related questions, please co ntact [CONTACT_321648] at [PHONE_6729] or [EMAIL_6289]  or cto-
[EMAIL_6306] .  
  If a patient experiences several adverse events and there are c onflicting 
recommendations, the investig ator should use the recommended do se adjustment that 
reduces the dose to the lowest level. 
 
 Combined ADT will be require d throughout duration of the study.   
 
 If patient desires to discontinue ADT, he will be removed from study 
treatment.  
 
 If patient develops serious advers e event felt to be related to  bicalutamide 
(e.g., liver toxicity) then bical utamide can be discontinued wh ile continuing 
LHRH agonist/antagonist pl us or minus palbociclib. 
 
  
46 
 7.1 Palbociclib Dose Reductions: 
 
In the event of significant treatment-related toxicity, palbociclib dosing may be interrupted or delayed and/or reduced as descri bed below. In the event of mult iple toxicities, dose 
modification should be based on t he worst toxicity observed.  
Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the fi rst occurrence of any adverse sign 
or symptom.  
            Dose levels are defined below: 
 
Dose Level Palbociclib 
0 125 mg daily 
-1 100 mg daily 
-2 75 mg daily 
 
o Dose modifications may occur in three ways: 
 Within a cycle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery fol lowed by 
[CONTACT_29874], if required. 
 Between cycles: next cycle administration may be delayed due to  persisting 
toxicity when a new cycle is due to start. 
 At start of the new cycle: dose reduction may be required in a subsequent cycle based on toxicity experi enced in the previous cycle.

7.1.3. A dose reduction of [ADDRESS_396917] the 
participant’s safety.  
 
o If palbociclib is delayed more than 4 weeks for any reason, or if a dose reduc tion 
below 75 mg daily is required, patients will be removed from pr otocol treatment. 
 
o Doses should be held until toxic ity resolution. Appropriate fol low up assessments, 
as defined by [CONTACT_093], should be undertaken until adeq uate recovery occurs.  
 
 
o Criteria required before treatment can resume are described in the Retreatment 
48 
 criteria section above. 
 
o Depending on when the adverse event resolved, a treatment inter ruption may lead 
to the patient missing all subsequent planned doses within that  same cycle or even 
to delay in the initiation of the subsequent cycle. 
 
o If the adverse event that led to the treatment interruption rec overs within the same 
cycle, then re-dosing in that cycle is allowed. Doses omitted f or toxicity are not 
replaced within the same cycle.  
 
o The need for a dose reduction at the time of treatment resumpti on should be based 
on the criteria defined in the Dose Reductions Section unless a n alternative plan is 
expressly agreed upon between the treating physician and the PI .  
 
o If a dose reduction is applied in  the same cycle, the patient w ill need to return to 
the clinic to rece ive new drug supply. 
  
7.2  Bicalutamide Dose Hold  
 
There are no dose reducti ons for Bicalutamide.    
 
7.2.1. Diarrhea: The major toxic effect of bicalutamide is moderate diarrhea which is rarely severe (exclusion of other causes of diarrhea should be considered in severe cases). The dose 
modifications for this will be as follows. 
 Grade 2 diarrhea, treat symptoma tically with ant i-diarrhea drug s. 
 Grade 2 diarrhea unresponsive to s ymptomatic treatment or Grade  3 or 4 diarrhea - 
discontinue bicalutamide until complete recovery. 
Further tests are up to discret ion of treating physician. Resta rt treatment as per protocol 
when diarrhea resolves to ≤ Grade 1.   
 7.2.2. Abnormal Liver Function Tests (SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, Bilirubin)  
Grade [ADDRESS_396918] op bicalutamide. Hepatitis scre ening (A, B, C) should be 
done in all cases of abnormal LFTs  which could be consistent wi th infectious hepatitis. 
To assess return to normal, abnormal liver function tests shoul d be done weekly or more 
frequently, as per the discre tion of the treating physician.   Bicalutamide may be restarted 
after LFTs normalize (< or = Grade 1) if the event is deemed no t related to Bicalutamide.  
 7.2.3. Patients may complain of flatu lence, bloating and mild "gas pains" which should 
not result in changes in treatme nt. Symptomatic treatment shoul d be employed with 
antacids, simethicone, etc.   7.2.4. If patient develops serious adverse event felt to be related to bicalutamide then 
bicalutamide can be discontinued while continuing LHRH agonist/  
antagonist plus or minus palbociclib  (based on arm). 
49 
  
7.2.5. For any other Grade 3-4 adverse ev ents which the investigator  believes to be 
related to bicalutamide and is clinically significant stop bica lutamide.   
 7.2.6 Asymptomatic Grade 3 or 4 labor atory findings, which are not c onsidered clinically 
significant may not require dose  hold. The decision to hold the  dose should be based on 
the investigator’s clinical judgment. 
 
 
8. ADVERSE EVENTS  
    
8.1 Adverse Events and Potential Risks Related to Palbociclib (see section 3.1). 
 
 For the most recent safety update, please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure.  
 For contraindications, interactio ns with other medications and known adverse reactions 
related to palbociclib p lease see section 3.1. 
 
8.2 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
 
8.2.1  Adverse event (AE) monitoring a nd reporting is a routine part  of every 
clinical trial and is done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as 
well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar a gents. Data on 
adverse events will be collected from the time of the initial s tudy treatment 
administration through [ADDRESS_396919] also be reported . Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) will continue to be followed until: 
 Resolution or the symptoms or signs that constitute the serious  adverse 
event return to baseline; 
 There is satisfactory explanati on other than the study treatmen t for the 
changes observed; or  
 Death. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_396920] be recorded as an 
adverse event in the patient’s  source documents and on the CRF regardless of 
frequency, severity (grade) or a ssessed relationship to the stu dy treatment.  
8.2.5   In addition to new events, any increase in the frequency or severity (i.e., 
toxicity grade) of a pre-existing condition that occurs after t he patient begins 
study treatment is also considered an adverse event. 
8.3 Definitions 
8.3.1 Adverse Event 
 An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal re lationship with 
this treatment. An AE can be a ny unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally as sociated with the 
use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  
 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive (i.e., surgical) procedures 
will not be reported as adverse events. However, the medical condition for which 
the procedure was performed must be reported if it meets the definition of an 
adverse event unless it is a pre-existing (p rior to protocol treatment) condition. 
 
 Symptoms of the original or tar geted disease will be considered adverse events. 
The following symptoms are indi cative of underlying disease (Metastatic Prostate 
Cancer) and will be reported as adverse events. Attribution to underlying disease 
versus therapy mu st be provided:  
 
o Bone Pain o Urinary Obstruction o Spi[INVESTIGATOR_304238] o Fractures  
 Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or re quire therapy. They are to be captured 
under the signs, symptoms or diagnoses associated with them.  
 
 Hy’s	Law	Cases.		Cases	of	potential 	drug‐induced	liver	injury	as	assessed	by	
[CONTACT_321621]	(“Hy’s 	Law	Cases”)	are	
 also	reportable	to 	[COMPANY_007].		If	a	
Study	subject	develops 	abnormal 	values	in	aspartate 	transaminase 	(AST)	or	
alanine	transaminase 	or	both,	concurrent 	with	abnormal 	elevations 	in	total	
bilirubin	and	no	other	known	cause	of	liver	injury,	that 	event	would	be 	
classified 	as	a	Hy’s	Law	Case.	This	reporting 	requirement 	is	 further	
explained 	in	the	training	material 	provided 	by	[CONTACT_4618]‐.		As	used	in	this	
Agreement, 	the	term	SAE	will	be	understood 	to	also	include	Hy’s	Law	
Cases.”	
51 
 8.3.2 Serious Adverse Event 
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of eit her the Site 
Investigator or the protocol P I it results in any of the follow ing outcomes: 
  
o Death 
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease  should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself. 
 
o A life-threatening adverse event 
An adverse even is considered ‘ life-threatening’ if, in the vie w of 
either the investigator [or sponsor], its occurrence places the  patient or 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adve rse event 
that, had it occurred in a more se vere form, might have caused death.  
 
o Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321552] 
> [ADDRESS_396921] normal life functions 
 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 
o Important medical event 
Any event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or  require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, the y may jeopardize the patient a nd 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this  definition of “Serious Adverse Event”. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in a n emergency room or at home; 
convulsions that do not result i n inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4794]. 
 
o Previously planned (prior to sig ning the informed consent form)  
surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying 
medical condition has worsened dur ing the course of the study. 
Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321553]’s medical history at t he time of 
study enrollment should not be consid ered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2853] w ithout a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_321554] l AE (for 
example, for the administrati on of study therapy or other proto col-
required procedure) should not be c onsidered SAEs. However, if the 
preexisting condition worsened dur ing the course of the study, it 
should be reported as an SAE.  
o Exposure During Pregnancy: 
[ADDRESS_396922] be reported if a male has been exposed ( e.g., 
due to treatment or environmenta l exposure) to the investigatio nal 
product prior to or around the t ime of conception of his child and/or is 
exposed during the partner’s pregnancy. 
 
8.3.3 Expected Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if: 
 For approved and marketed drugs or devices, those adverse events 
are described in the approve d Package Insert (Label).  
 For investigational new drugs, t hose adverse events are describ ed 
in the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.  
 In clinical research studies , information on expected adverse 
events is also summarized in the  protocol and in the consent 
document.  See section 3.[ADDRESS_396923] of expected adverse eve nts 
related to the drug under study. 
8.3.4 Unexpected Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is consid ered “unexpected” if it is not d escribed in 
the Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in published medic al 
literature, in the protocol, or  in the informed consent documen t.

 9. TISSUE PROCESSING/CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
 9.1 Tissue / Laboratory Correlative Studies  
 
9.1.1. Collection and Handling of Specimens 
 From each patient, tissue speci mens will be collected from: 
 a) A metastatic site of disease (via biopsy) or adequate metas tatic tissue from prior 
biopsy or resection.  b) Archived prostatectomy or biopsy specimen from the primary prostate tumor (if 
available, via retrieval of prev iously archived specimens). 
 
c) Blood/circulating tumor cells (pre-treatment, week 12,  after 28 weeks of therapy, 
and at progression/or coming off protocol treatment).  
 The rationale, and a brief overvie w, for collection and handlin g of these specimens is 
as described below. Further technical details regarding biopsies of metastatic sites and handling of these biopsy specimens can be found in Appendices B  and C, respectively.   
 
9.1.1a Biopsy of metastatic site: Ra tionale and Procedure (Appendices B and C) 
 
a. Preclinical and clinical data indicates that palbociclib primarily exerts its effect via

 An ultrasound (US) can be used for lymph node or soft tissue bi opsies 
provided that the target lym ph node or soft tissue mass is visi ble with the US 
and can be properly accessed.  
 Verbal and written informed consent will be obtained after disc ussion of 
risks (bleeding, infection, soft  tissue and bone injury, inconc lusive biopsy

 Standard laboratory tests to assess coagulation and bleeding wi ll also be 
completed prior to the procedure. A standard operating procedure for bone 
biopsy is provided in Appendix B .  A standard operating procedure for 
soft tissue biopsy is provided in Appendix C . 
 
 In order to ensure adequate tumor sample as long as it is deeme d safe and 
based on accessibility, target lesion size, specimen integrity, s p e c i m e n  
appearance, intra-procedural bleeding, tumor biopsy should attempt to obtain: 
 
1. Bone biopsy: 2-8 bone biopsy samples .   In addition, at the time of 
biopsy, it will be determined if  a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_321555], and 
if performed, the bone marrow aspi [INVESTIGATOR_321556].  
2. Lymph node or soft tissue: If obtaining a 1-cm-long 18-gauge core 
specimen, attempts should be made to obtain at least [ADDRESS_396932] 4 cores.   
 
If core biopsy is unsuccessful, a lymph node aspi[INVESTIGATOR_321557], 
but is likely to be insufficient to  allow Rb status determination and

9.1.1b Archived Prostate Cancer Samples: Rationale and Procurem ent Procedure 
 
Occasionally, newly metastatic prostate cancer is identified by  [CONTACT_321623].  This tissue may be utilized for RB sta tus assessment, trial 
enrollment and randomization if it is of adequate quality for IHC analysis of RB status. Additionally, previous diagnostic tissue is being requested fro m all patients to assess 
whether RB status and other correlative markers are maintained between diagnostic 
and metastatic samples with or without previous hormonal therap y.   
 If resection specimens are availab le (preferred): The block wit h the highest volume of 
representative tumor histology from the index focus OR 16 unsta ined, unbaked sections 
(4-5 microns in thickness) on g lass slides (charged or uncharge d) should be shipped at 
room temperature to the University of Michigan.  If biopsy specimens are available: Three blocks with the highes t volume of 
representative tumor histology OR 15 unstained, unbaked section s (4-5 microns in 
thickness) on glass slides (charged or uncharged) from up to th ree blocks should be 
shipped at room temperature to t he University of Michigan. If u nstained sections are 
sent, they should be labeled with the block number/letter. If l ess than three blocks have 
57 
 cancer, then all blocks with cancer OR as many unstained sectio ns as can be cut from 
blocks with cancer without exhaustion should be sent.

9.1.3 Sites Performing Correlative Studies   
 
Aside from the circulating tumor cell studies, all correlative studies will be performed at 
the University of Michigan, within the Michigan Center for Tran slational Pathology 
(MCTP). [CONTACT_321649], translational co-investigator, and [CONTACT_321650], study 
pathologist, will oversee these correlative studies, with additional consultation provided [CONTACT_321651], translational co-investigator. The circulati ng tumor cell studies will 
be performed by [CONTACT_195244]. 
 
9.1.4 Processing of Specimens aft er Receipt at the University o f Michigan  
 
a. With the receipt of each biopsy specimen, Javed Siddiqui at the  University of 
Michigan (or a pre-specified desi gnee) will place the samples i n the -80˚C tissue 
repository described below and will record two additional items  for further quality 
assurance: 
 1) The date/time of receipt of the biopsy specimen at the Univ ersity of Michigan 
 2) The date/time that the biopsy specimen is placed at -80°C 
 b. Biopsies from metastatic sites: The frozen tissue samples from  either biopsy or from 
preexisting metastatic tissue, obtained for research from patie nts taking part in this 
protocol will be held in the University of Michigan Prostate On cology Program Tissue 
Bank.  The Tissue Bank is located in Room 1143, [ADDRESS_396936], 
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan [ZIP_CODE]. This laboratory has multiple -80˚C freezers, one of which will be devoted to the biopsies fro m this trial. The freezers 
[ADDRESS_396937] of two biopsie s or a biopsy and an 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. One sample from each metastatic biopsy (the biopsy sa mple in cases where 
there is a biopsy sample and an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) will be fixed in form alin shortly after receipt 
at the University of Michigan.  Eight 5 um section slides will be cut from this formalin 
fixed sample -- one for H&E staining to confirm the presence of  tumor, two for 
determination of RB status and th e others for correlative studi es.  The remaining 
formalin-fixed metastatic biopsy sample will be utilized for ta rgeted 
transcriptome/genome sequencing.  Where feasible, transcriptome sequencing and whole exome capture will be performed on remaining frozen metas tatic biopsy 
materials.  
c. Primary tumor samples: Retrieved primary tumor samples will be stored at room 
temperature in the University of  Michigan Prostate Oncology Pro gram Tissue 
Bank, and will be assessed for RB pathway biomarkers, as well a s for genetic 
alterations by [CONTACT_321624]/genome sequencing .  
 
d. Blood samples for circulating tumor DNA studies: Blood samples received will 
have genomic DNA extracted per st andard protocols.  Samples will then be stored 
in -80C freezer.  Further analyse s of these blood samples will proceed once the 
genomic studies have been performed on the biopsy samples.24-28 
 
e. Blood samples for circulating tumor cell studies:  The Epic Sci ences platform will be 
utilized for circulating tumor cell analyses.24-[ADDRESS_396938], the identification of CTCs consists of three markers (DAP I-nucleus, cytokeratin – 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_90293], and CD-45 – white blood cell marker) and are  imaged on custom-
built automated slide imagers. The resulting images are then au tomatically processed 
to produce data for technical analysis which consists of removi ng imaging artifacts and 
selecting potential CTC candidates which are then presented in a web-based report to a pathologist for final review. Remaining slides are stored for  subsequent analysis.  
These subsequent analyses will include immunofluorescence for t he androgen receptor 
(AR), including AR C-terminal and AR N-terminal expression.  
9.2   Description of RB Assessment and Correlative Studies  
 
9.2.1 RB Status Determination  
A s  p a r t  o f  t h e  p a t i e n t  s e l e c t i o n  for this trial, patients will undergo 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for tot al RB status in a CLIA certif ied laboratory, per a 
previously published RB IHC protocol.32 IHC will be performed for RB using a mouse-
60 
 anti-RB monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, G3-2 45) using 
automated IHC staining on the Ventana Medical Systems Benchmark  Ultra autostainer. 
Slides are pre-treated with CC1 for 40 minutes, incubated with primary antibody for 16 
minutes at 37 C (1:1600 dilution in Ventana diluent [ZIP_CODE]). Tum or RB status will be 
determined by [CONTACT_321625] 100 tumor cells (o r all cells if less than 100 
cells are present). Nuclear RB staining intensity in tumor cells will be assessed as 
negative (0), weak (1+), moderate (2+) or strong (3+). Inflamma tory, endothelial and/or 
stromal cells will be used as internal positive controls. Based  on validation studies 
using samples with known RB retention or deletion, tumor sample s with >5% of cells 
showing at least moderate RB expression or 20% of tumor cells s howing at least weak 
RB expression will be considered positive and eligible for the trial. For correlative studies, RB staining will be quantified in positive patients by  [CONTACT_321626] 
(1=weak, 2=moderate , 3=strong).     
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_396939] of oncogenic (e.g., cyclin D 1 
overexpression/amplification) or tumor suppressive (e.g., p16in k4a silencing) 
alterations, IHC for cyclin D1, cyclin D1B (a variant associate d with aggressive 
disease), and p16 will be performed.[ADDRESS_396940] defined  a signature [CONTACT_321645],7 
immunohistochemistry will be performed for key RB target genes (such as Cyclin A 
and MCM7).  Finally, we will also assay the status of the RB interactor, E2F1, via IHC. 
In both the primary tumor samples and metastatic biopsies, IHC biomarkers will be 
quantified by [CONTACT_321627] s by [CONTACT_321628] (0=negative to 3=strong) by e xperienced pathologists. 
For Ki-67, proliferative index will be determined by [CONTACT_321629] g the percentage of 
tumor cells with nuclear staini ng. Statistical analyses plans f or these correlative studies 
are described in Section 13.   9.2.3 Targeted DNA sequencing and expression profiling.  While the ultimate goal 
would be to perform comprehensive sequencing (see below) on all  the biopsy studies 
from this clinical trial, the tissue limitations regarding tumo r quantity may preclude 
comprehensive sequencing on a subset of samples.  Specifically,  in patients in which 
only one biopsy core can be obtained, this single core will be converted to a formalin-
fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimen, to allow assessment of  t h e  p r i m a r y  
biomarker (RB) using a validated assay (IHC) in a CLIA-certifie d laboratory.  While 
comprehensive sequencing cannot be reliably performed on FFPE b iopsy specimens, 
targeted sequencing and expression profiling can be performed o n these limited FFPE 
tissues. Specifically, we will assess a novel panel of recurren t alterations identified 
61 
 across prostate cancer profiling studies.  
 DNA and RNA will be co-isolated using a commercially available kit (Qiagen All Prep DNA/RNA FFPE) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For  DNA based 
alterations, a Haloplex custom capture panel (Agilent Technolog ies) will be utilized 
with Ion Torrent-based sequencing on the PGM/Proton sequencing systems according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Our team (S Tomlins) has pr eviously developed a 
Haloplex Custom Design (Agilent ) for capture-based targeted sequencing of complete 
coding sequences of 80 genes prev iously reported as significantly mutated in prostate 
cancer, 46 therapeutic targets, and 50 causal cancer genes; thi s approach has been 
optimized for 200 ng of genomic DNA.  We will adapt this platfo rm to include potential 
biomarkers of response as identified in Section 9.2.1.  Identif ied variants will be 
assessed for potential as drivers of resistance to CDK4/6 inhib ition or ADT based on 
known roles in oncogenesis and prostate cancer, comparison to O ncomine and 
COSMIC mutational data, and comparison to CRPC tissue expressio n profiles (as 
previously published by [CONTACT_62236]
16,34), and integration with AR chip-seq 
profiles.[ADDRESS_396941] 
been selected to assess AR signaling status (including both AR induced/repressed and 
neuroendocrine genes), known prostate cancer fusions (through 5 ’ and 3’ assays for 
ETS genes, FGFR2, RAF/RAS family members, etc), potential thera peutic targets in 
other malignancies (such as 5’ and 3’ assays for ALK and RET over-expression), as well as housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_8582]. qPCR will be performed on the ABI Quantstudio 12K flex system using TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix and 384 well TLDA c ards. 
 
9.2.4 Comprehensive next-generation sequencing.  For specimens in which enough 
tumor tissue was present (i.e., additional frozen biopsy specim ens), exome sequencing 
and RNA-sequencing using Illumina based technology will be perf ormed as described 
using robust protocols and pi[INVESTIGATOR_321566].16,35-[ADDRESS_396942] 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_321567], and identify gene 
fusions, point mutations, indels  and copy number variants.   
62 
 9.2.5 Circulating tumor DNAs as predictive biomarkers of respon se to androgen 
deprivation therapy alone or in combination with Palbociclib.  
 
Detection of DNA in the serum o f patients with metastatic prostate cancer, may allow 
determination of tractable bioma rkers of disease status and res ponsiveness to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Here we will collected and analyze serum for circulating tumor DNA to determine if 
we can identify markers of disease state and responsiveness.40  In particular, potential 
biomarkers identified via target ed sequencing and expression pr ofiling of the metastatic 
biopsy samples (see 9.2.3) will be assessed within the blood sa mples as well, to 
determine if these blood samples can serve as a less invasive a pproach of querying 
relevant biomarkers.   
9.2.6 Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) Count and Heterogeneity as p redictive 
biomarkers of response to androgen deprivation therapy alone or  in combination 
with Palbociclib.   CTCs will be enumerated using the Epic Sciences System utiliz ing 
automated fluorescence- based microscopy systems that permit co mputer-generated 
reconstruction of cellular images. In addition, immunofluoresen ce-based approaches 
assessing for CK, CD45, DAPI, and AR expression will be used to  determine the extent 
of CTC heterogeneity (distributi on of CTC phenotypes, such as n ucleoli CTCs, CTC 
clusters, CK- CTCs, CK speckled CTCs, small CTCs, AR nuclear CT Cs, and AR 
cytoplasmic CTCs).  Associations between outcome and CTC count/ heterogeneity will 
be performed as per Section 13.4.

 For the purposes of this study, patients wi ll have a PSA evalua tion at the start of each new 
cycle with primary endpoint assessment after 28 weeks of therap y.  Radiologic response 
will be determined after 28 weeks plus or minus 1 week (or as p rompted by [CONTACT_23805]) 
and every 24 weeks plus or minus 1 week thereafter while on study for 2 years, then 
annually and otherwise if  clinically indicated. 
 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_205989] d Response Evaluation Criteria i n Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1).[ADDRESS_396946] diameter (unidimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions and the shor test diameter in the case of m alignant lymph nodes are 
used in the RECIST criteria. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_396947] one dimension (longest diameter to be reco rded) as >[ADDRESS_396948] x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_396949] scan, or >[ADDRESS_396950] be recorded in m illimeters (or 
decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiat ed area might or might 
not be considered measurable.  Decision should be made in consu ltation with 
primary investigator.  Malignant lymph nodes.  To be cons idered patholo gically enlarge d and measurable, 
a lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_396951] s can (CT 
66 
 scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in 
follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All othe r lesions (or sites of disease ), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes wi th ≥10 to <15 
mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone le sions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites,  pleural/pericardial effusions,  lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal ma sses (not followed 
by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable. 
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographical ly defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurab le nor non-
measurable) since they are , by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to repre sent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurabilit y described above. 
However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient,  these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions. 
 
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 le sions per organ and 
5 lesions in total, representa tive of all involved organs, shou ld be identified as 
target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest d iameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should b e those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be th e case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducib le measurement in 
which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measure d reproducibly 
should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-no dal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculat ed and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diamete rs will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) in cluding any measurable 
lesions over and above the [ADDRESS_396952]-therapy PSA changes  
 
o Primary Endpoint will be stable or declining PSA < 4ng/mL after  28 weeks of 
therapy  
 
67 
 o Secondary Endpoint will be rate of undetectable PSA  after 28 weeks of therapy 
(<0.2ng/mL) 
 
o These definitions are intended to  characterize the PSA changes on study for the 
purpose of reporting of results.    
 
Complete Response (CR):  Undetectable PSA (<0.2 ng/ml) that is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_321630] 4 weeks interval. 
 
Partial Response (PR):  PSA level between 0.2ng/ml and 4ng/ml.. 
 
Stabilization (SD):  Patients who do not meet the criteria for PR or PD for at leas t 
90 days on study (2 cycles of treat ment) will be considered sta ble 
 
Progression (PD):  25% increase ove r baseline or nadir whichever is lower and an 
increase in the absolute value of PSA level by 2 ng/ml that is confirmed by [CONTACT_321631] 4 weeks interval. 
  
11.2.2  Outcomes based on evaluation of target lesions 
     Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target  lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
    Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
    Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on stud y (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to  the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered pr ogressions). 
 
    Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to  qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest su m diameters while on 
study. 
 
11.2.3  Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
     Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be n on-pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis). 
   
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
[ADDRESS_396953] be rep resentative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesi on increase.     
Although a clear progression of “ non-target” lesions only is ex ceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_205948], and the 
progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_941] r eview panel (or 
Principal Investigator). 
 
11.2.4  Outcomes based on Radionuclide bone scans  
 
The subjectivity in interpreting s erial changes in a radionucli de bone scan is well 
recognized.  Thus, the primary outcome will be whether the scan  is stable or 
improved, vs. worse or progression.  Changes in intensity will not be used as an 
outcome measure. 
 
Stable or Improved : A stable or improved classif ication requires that no new 
lesions appear or that new pai n has not developed in an area th at was previously 
visualized. 
 
Progression (Non-Response) : Appearance of two or more  new skeletal lesions. 
An increase in the size or intensity of known skeletal lesions will not be 
considered progression . 
 
    
11.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be  performed as closely as poss ible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 6 w eeks before registration.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up . Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_321632](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be con sidered measurable when they a re 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and pal pable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estima te the size of the 
lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x-ray:   Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surr ounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, C T is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurabil ity of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_396954] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable 
lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also accept able in certain 
situations (e.g.  for body scans).   
 
U se o f  MR I rem ain s a co m p lex  issu e.   MR I h as ex ce llen t  co n tra st , spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved 
in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934],  and measurement.  
Furthermore, the availability o f MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI 
is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with 
CT, the modality used at follow- up should be the same as was us ed at baseline and 
the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse seque nce.  It is beyond 
the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pu lse sequence 
parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally , the same type of 
scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol shoul d be followed as 
closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be perfo rmed with breath-
hold scanning techniqu es, if possible. 
   Bone disease:  Bone disease wi ll be evaluated using Radionucl ide bone scan. 
 
11.4 Progression-Free Survival: 
 
Progression-free survival (PFS) i s defined as the duration of t ime from start of treatment 
to time of progression or deat h, whichever occurs first.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_396955] response recorded from th e start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the ach ievement of both measurement a nd confirmation 
criteria.

Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status req uiring

progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic 
deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after dis continuation of treatment .

       11.6 Duration of Response 
 
11.6.1 Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall r esponse is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is fi rst recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressi ve disease is objectively docum ented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measuremen t criteria are first met for 
CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively  documented.

 This study will be monitored by a representative of the Clinica l Trials Office (CTO) of the 
UMCCC. Monitoring visits will be made during the conduct of the  study and at study close-out. 
 
Prior to subject recruitment, a participating site will undergo  site initiation meeting to be conducted 
by [CONTACT_154464]. This will be done as an actual s ite visit; teleconference, 
videoconference, or web-based mee ting after the site has been g iven access to the study database 
and assembled a study reference binder.  The site’s principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16514]. Stu dy–related questions or issues 
identified during the site initiation meeting will be followed- up by [CONTACT_311002].  Monitoring of this study will include both ‘Centralized Monitor ing’, the review of source 
documents at the CTO and ‘On-site Monitoring’, an actual site v isit.  The first ‘Centralized’ visit 
should occur after the first subj ect enrolled completes the fir st treatment cycle .  The study site will 
send the de-identified source documents to the CTO for monitori ng.  ‘Centralized’ monitoring may 
be requested by [CONTACT_321633]. The site 
will send in pertinent de-identified source documents, as defined by [CONTACT_321634].   The first annual ‘On-site’ monitoring visit should occur after the first five study participants are 
enrolled or twelve months after a study opens, whichever occurs  first.  The annual visit may be 
conducted as a ‘Centralized’ visit if less than three subjects have enrolled at the study site.  The 
type of visit is at the discretion of the CTO.  At a minimum, a  routine monitoring visit will be done 
at least once a year, or once during the course of the study if  the study duration is less than 12 
months. The purpose of the se visits is to verify: 
 
 Adherence to the protocol 
 Completeness and accuracy of st udy data and samples collected 
 Proper storage, dispensing and inventory of study medication 
 Compliance with regulations 
 During a monitoring visit to a site, access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l and clinical records must be given 
by [CONTACT_321635] t he monitoring visit to verify 
consistency of data collected on the CRFs with the original sou rce data.  While most patient cases 
will be selected from patients accrued since the previous monitoring visit, any patient case has the potential for review.  At least one or more unannounced cases w ill be reviewed, if the total accruals 
warrant selection of unannounced cases.   The Clinical Trials Office expects the relevant investigational  staff to be available to facilitate the 
conduct of the visit, that source documents are available at th e time of the visit, and that a suitable 
environment
 will be provided for review of study-related documents. Any iss ues identified during 
these visits will be communicated to the site and are expected to be resolved by [CONTACT_16547] a timely 
manner.  For review of study-related documents at the CTO, the site will be required to ship or fax documents to be reviewed.    Participating site will also undergo a site close-out upon comp letion, termination or cancellation 
of a study to ensure fulfillment of study obligations during th e conduct of the st udy, and that the 
site Investigator is aware of his/her ongoing responsibilities. In general, a site close-out is 
73 
 conducted during a site visit; however, site close-out can occu r without a site visit if all of the 
following apply: 
 
 No patient has signed the Inform ed Consent Form and has enrolle d into the study 
 Investigational agent  has not been dispensed 
 All investigational agent and materials have been returned as d e f i n e d  f o r  t h e  s t u d y  o r  
destroyed and accounted for properly.  
12.[ADDRESS_396957] a ‘for cause’ audi t of the trial if the board identifies 
a need for a more rigorous evaluation of study-related issues. A “for cause” audit would be 
conducted by [CONTACT_321636] e Review Committee (QARC) of t he University of Michigan 
Comprehensive Cancer Center.  A regulatory authority (e.g., FDA)  may also wish to conduct an inspection of the  study, during its 
conduct or even after its completion. If an inspection has been requested by a regulatory authority, the site investigator must immediately inform the Clinical Tria ls Office that such a request has 
been made. 
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 13.1 Statistical Design 
 
The primary analysis will be assessment of the proportion of pa tients who achieve a 
PSA < 4ng/mL after 28 weeks of treatment in each arm.  For purp oses of the primary 
endpoint, day 1 will be the random ization date for patients wit h pre-registration ADT 
treatment and the treatment start date for patients’ naïve to A DT at registration.  The 
difference in proportions will be reported with the mid p-value  test of the 2X2 table 
with a one-sided type I error o f 10%.   The binomial proportions with the corresponding 
Wilson score 90% binomial confidence intervals will also be rep orted by [INVESTIGATOR_216].  
 
The primary endpoint of the st udy is to compare the proportion of patients who have a 
PSA < 4ng/mL after 28 weeks of protocol treatment between patie nts stratified by [CONTACT_094]-
registration ADT treatment and extent of disease and randomized to combined androgen deprivation (ADT: LHRH  agonist + bicalutamide) and tho se randomized to 
combined ADT + palbociclib.  ADT alone (Arm 1) is expected to r esult in 70% of 
patients achieving PSA < 4ng/mL after seven months of protocol treatment.  It is 
hypothesized that the ADT + palboc iclib arm (Arm 2) will have a  20% absolute 
increase in proportion to 90% (H A: p2 – p 1 > 0).  The null hypothesis is no difference in 
proportions (H 0: p2 – p 1 ≤ 0).  Patients will be randomi zed using a 1:2 (Arm 1: Arm 2) 
schema stratified by [CONTACT_152056]. Up to 95 patients may n eed to be registered 
(enrolled) in order to obtain the 60 evaluable patients. All pa tients randomized will be 
evaluable if they receive 1 cycle of treatment or are removed d uring treatment due to 
toxicity.  Patients who are randomized but do not complete 1 cy cle of treatment due to 
reasons other than toxicity will be replaced.  With 20 evaluabl e patients on ADT alone 
and 40 evaluable patients on combination ADT + palbociclib, the re is 64.2% power to 
[ADDRESS_396958] a 20% difference in pr oportions with a one-sided type I error of 0.10 using the 
mid p-value method of the Fisher’s exact test.  
 
With regard to power of the study, the focus of this trial is f easibility and to detect a 
signal, as described by [CONTACT_321637]. The 
compromise of the power was done because of the overwhelming be nefit to include a 
control population since there is  no data on the rate of PSA de clines after [ADDRESS_396959] as 
it is a very close approximation to the one margin condition an d is more powerful 
compared to the Fisher’s exact test, which is very conservative due to conditioning on 
both margins.42 
 
13.2 Analysis Plan 
The primary analysis will be assessment of the proportion of pa tients who achieve a 
PSA < 4ng/mL after 28 weeks of treatment in each arm.  The diff erence in proportions 
will be reported with the mid p-value method of the Fisher’s ex act test of the 2X2 table.  
The binomial proportions with the corresponding Wilson score 90 % binomial 
confidence intervals will also be reported by [INVESTIGATOR_216].  
 
Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerabili ty.  Frequency of adverse event types 
will be reported for each arm by [CONTACT_321638].  Durati on of therapy, dose 
modifications and treatment delays will be reported to describe tolerability within each 
arm. 
 
The proportion of patients who achieve undetectable PSA (<0.2ng /mL), PSA response, 
and radiographic response will be reported by [CONTACT_321639].  Biochemical progression-free survival will b egin from treatment 
start until the event of biochemical (PSA) progression (section  11.2) or death, 
whichever occurs first.  Patie nts who do not have either event will be censored at their 
last known PSA date.  Clinical p rogression-free survival will b egin from treatment start 
until the event of clinical progression or death, whichever occ urs first.  Patients who 
do not have either event will be censored at the date of their last known clinical 
measure.  Biochemical PFS and clinical PFS will be described by  [CONTACT_311832]-
Meier methods and log-rank p-values will be reported. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_396960] e markers may be 
investigated using logistic modeling if there is indication tha t more than one marker 
75 
 is associated with response.  This is an exploratory aim for di scovery so multiple 
testing control will not be included. 
 
13.3.2 Concordance in RB status will be described between primary tumor, and 
metastases within patients using a generalized kappa.  Pairwise  concordance will 
be described with proportions, McN emar’s test and kappa statist ic. 
 
 13.3.[ADDRESS_396961] 
response to palbociclib, patients will be class ified as respond ers or non-responders 
and individual biomarkers will be assessed for associations with response by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact tests or logistic  regression. A comparison of th e results for the subset 
of markers tested in 13.3.1 will be reported.  Similar approach es will be used with 
transcriptome/exome sequencing data.  13.3.[ADDRESS_396962] response.

4 100% bedridden.  Completely disabled.  Cannot carry on any self-care.  Totally confined to bed or chair. [ADDRESS_396971], MRI, and/or bone s can (where applicable).  The  decision regarding which 
metastatic lesion to biopsy s hould depend on three main factors : 
1) Size of lesion (with preference towards the largest lesion) 
2) Safety (with obvious preference towards least ri sk to the patient) 
3) For bone lesions, the intensit y of lesion activity on bone scan  (with preference 
towards the most intense activity) 
Verbal and written informed consen t will be obtained after discussion of risks (bleeding, 
infection, soft tissue and bone i njury, inconclusive biopsy res ults) of the procedure.  Standard 
laboratory tests to assess coagulation and bleeding will also b e completed prior to the procedure.  
Conscious sedation will be used a s necessary using intravenous Fentanyl and Midazolam with 
appropriate nursing support. In ord er to ensure adequate tumor sample as long as it is deemed 
safe and based on accessibility, ta rget lesion size, specimen integrity, specimen appearance, 
intra-procedural b leeding, tumor biopsy should attempt to obtai n   2-[ADDRESS_396972] scanner for the 
purpose of biopsy planning.  Biopsies will be performed using sterile technique and lidocaine local anesthetic. For bone lesions , a clinically-available 11-t o-14 gauge bone cutting needle, with 
or without a co-axial troc ar, will be used to obtain  two to eight  biopsy samples of the selected 
lesion.  Options for obtaining multiple samples of the biopsy c an include: 
a) Sequential advancement of needle  passes through a fixed trocar, 
such that each needle pass progr esses more deeply into the bone 
lesion 
b) Re-insertion and re-direction of the needle and/or trocar through another region of the bone lesion  
c) Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_321568], by [CONTACT_133552] a [ADDRESS_396973] imaging will be repeated  to assess for immediate 
complications.  The patient wi ll be observed for 2 – [ADDRESS_396974]-guided Biopsy of Metastati c Prostate Cancer 
Lesion in Soft Tissue 
 
The patient’s imaging will be reviewed and all soft tissue or n odal lesions deemed suspi[INVESTIGATOR_321569]. A target for sampling will be se lected based on: 1) perceived 
percutaneous access with respect  to safety and technical feasibility, and 2) suspected likelihood 
of obtaining malignant tissue. In the cases where both bone and  soft tissue lesions are safely 
accessible and have high likelihood s of containing malignant tissue, it would be preferable to 
biopsy the soft tissue lesion.  
 
 For lymph nodes or soft tissue lesions a CT scan will be utiliz ed.  An ultrasound may be 
utilized, provided that the target lymph node or soft tissue ma ss is visible and accessible. 
    
 In order to ensure adequate tum or sample as long as it is deeme d safe and based on 
accessibility, target lesion size , specimen integrity, specimen  appearance, intra-
procedural bleeding, tumor biopsy should attempt to obtain: 
o  at least [ADDRESS_396975] es as described for bone lesions, 
including sequential advancemen t through the lesion, re-insertion/re-direction, or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_321570].  Mitigating factors may include but are not limited to: 1) safet y of obtaining multiple core 
specimens, 2) friability of the  core specimens on visual inspection, 3) target size, 4) perceived 
likelihood of obtaining additional diagnostic tissue by [CONTACT_321641]. After biopsy is 
performed, the biopsy would be snap frozen, as described in App endix E.  No aspi[INVESTIGATOR_321571].

 Appendix D: Standard Operating P rocedure (SOP) for Handling Sam ples  
 
1.0 PURPOSE  
To standardize the method for ha ndling frozen needle tumor biop sies, to optimize specimen use 
for molecular analyses. 
 
2.0 MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED  
 
2.1 Sample kit containing: 
Dual sample kit will be sent t o each enrolling site immediately  following patient 
registration 
A) Cell Free DNA 2 tubes B) Sheet for reco rding biopsy details 
This sample kit will be sent t o each enrolling site immediately  following patient 
registration. 
 
2.2 Other materials which will be s ent to each enrolling site at t he initiation of the clinical trial 
(to be kept for use over serial cases):  
a) One box Tissue Tek™ cryomolds 
b) Large bottle of Tissue Tek™ OCT 
c) Blue Pads, Markers  
d) Sterile tweezers  
e) Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_12673] 
f) A supply of additional Cell-Free DNA tubes  
g) Boxes for shipment of Cell-Free DNA samples (see Appendix F) 
 
2.3 Materials that will be provided by [CONTACT_186611]: 
a) Dry ice  
b) -80°C freezer (particularly i n the case of Friday biopsies) 
 
3.[ADDRESS_396976] 24 hours prior to the biop sy, the research coordinator is to notify the institutional 
research team involved in this protocol, of the scheduled sample collections.  A laboratory 
technician should pi[INVESTIGATOR_321572] (see 2.1 above), and p repare cryomolds prior to the 
biopsy, by [CONTACT_25534], using the  provided alcohol-proof mark er, with the following 
information:               Clinical protocol number              Specimen ID               Biopsy time and Date       The research coordinator and the laboratory technician should also confirm, on the day prior to biopsy, the availability of materials needed for handling the b iopsies, as specified in Section [ADDRESS_396977] 15 min ahead of 
the scheduled biopsy to allow sufficient time to set up laborat ory supplies and ensure rapid 
83 
 transport of specimens to the laboratory after collection.  He or she should also re-confirm, at 
that time, the availability of  all specimens from Section 2.  H e should also, immediately before 
the biopsy, fill the insulated bucke t with dry ice and isopentane. 
 
3.3  Immediately after the biopsy is performed, the freshly collected specimen should be placed in the cryomold.  A single drop  of Tissue Tek™ OCT should be p laced on the specimen, and the 
sterile tweezers should be used to gently hold one end of the f reshly collected needle biopsy and 
to push the biopsy to the bottom of  the cryomold cassette with forceps.  Make sure biopsy is as 
flat as possible. The cryomol d should then be filled with OCT, and the cryomold should be 
immediately placed in direct contact [CONTACT_45355]/isopentan e cocktail until the bottom of the 
OCT freezes and turns white.  Only the bottom of the cryomold s hould contact [CONTACT_321642]/isopentane--none of the dry ice/isopentane should spi[INVESTIGATOR_321573].   
This process can be repeated using separate cryomold cassettes for separate biopsy samples. 3.[ADDRESS_396978] cryomolds on dry ice for transport.  The use d isopentane should be 
poured back into its bot tle using funnel.     
3.5 For bone lesions, an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_321574] b e performed, as described in 
Section C, using a 20 cc sterile syr inge.  The contents of this syringe (clotted a spi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) should be 
transferred into a 1.7 mL eppendorf tube.  Several drops of Tis sue Tek™ OCT should be added 
to the tube, such that the clot ted aspi[INVESTIGATOR_321575].  The eppendorf tube should then be 
closed, and placed on dry ice for snap freezing. 3.6 The cryopreserved biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_56586](s) should be sto red at -80°C until shipment.  
Ideally, shipment should occur on the same day as the biopsy, u nless the biopsy occurs on a 
Friday, in which case the speci men should be preserved at -80°C  until shipment on the following 
Monday.

until ready to transfer to the larger shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3858]. (can fit tw o of these specimen boxes 
in a shipper box that is t he designated size above) 
7. Fill the shipper box about half way with dry ice (about 1-2 inc hes in height) and place 
the specimen box inside with shipper. 
8. Add more dry ice to cover the specimen boxes. (about 1 or 2 inc hes in height again 
and 1-2 inches on the sides the boxes as well).  Note: there should be sufficient dry 
ice to maintain the samples  at -20°C for at least [ADDRESS_396982] (see Appendix D ) for all specimens. Retain copi[INVESTIGATOR_321580]. 
12. Seal the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_321581] e flaps of the insulated box along the top edges. 
13. At this point, you should check tha t your final packaging consi sts of three 
components (triple packaging): 
 (a) a primary receptacles (the specimen tubes)  
 ( b )  a secondary packaging ([ADDRESS_396983] specimen box) 
 ( c )  a rigid outer packaging (la rger cardboard shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3858]) 
14. Should you decide to use alternative  packaging materials instea d of those listed 
above, please note the following requirements: 
The primary receptacles must be packed in secondary packaging i n such a way 
that, under normal conditions of transport, they cannot break, be punctured or leak 
their contents into the secondary packaging. Secondary packagin gs must be 
secured in outer packaging with suitable cushioning material. Any leakage of the 
contents must not compromise th e integrity of the cushioning ma terial or of the 
outer packaging. The primary container (i.e. test tube) must be leak proof, as should the secondary container. T he outer packaging (tertiary c ontainer) does not 
have to be leak proof.  Packaging mus t comply with the IATA packing 
instructions 650 which are summa rized below; for further questi ons, please refer

hours of study enrollment.  Mild to moderate symptoms are defined as:  O2 Saturation 
>94%, no requirement of supplemental O 2, lack of known sepsis or organ failure. Subjects 
will be randomly assigned to favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] (the first two doses are 1800 mg given 
approximately 12 hours apart , followed by 800mg approximately every 12 hours  to 
complete  10 days of therapy ) or placebo.  
Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] A selective inhibitor of viral RNA -dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) with potent 
antiv iral activity against single -stranded RNA viruses including coronaviruses. It is 
indicated in the treatment of influenza in Japan and  China and COVID -19 in Russia and 
India. 
Sample size  The entire study: approximately 1250 (approximately 625 subjects  per treatment arm ) are 
estimated to be sufficient  to get 815  sustained  clinical recoveries.    
The viral shedding sub -study: approximately 550 (approximately 275 per arm) to obtain 
112 viral shedding events .

Endpoints  
 
 
 Symp tom Assessment:  
A patient -reported outcome (PRO)  instrument will be used to assess COVID -19-related 
symptoms (measuring signs and symptoms best known by [CONTACT_836094]). The assessment will be performed every 24 hours at 
approximately the same time each day .  The following symptoms will be included in the 
daily assessment ( regardless of which symptoms the subject had at baseline, as new 
symptoms may appear following the baseline assessment ):  
a. Stuffy or runny nose, sore throat,  shortness of breath, cough, lack of energy 
or tiredness, muscle or body aches, headache, chills or shivering, feeling hot 
or fever ish, nausea : subjects rate symptom at its worst over a 24 -hour period 
using a 4 -point scale for severity - 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe  
b. Vomitin g, diarrhea: subjects rate symptom frequency over a 24 -hour period 
using a 4 -point scale for frequency - 0= not at all, 1=1 –2 times, 2=3 –4 times, 
3=5 or more times  
c. Sense of taste, sense of smell  (not included in the Primary Endpoint 
assessment) : subjects rate symp tom over a 24 -hour period using a 3 -point 
scale - 0= sense (of smell or taste) is the same as usual, 1= sense is less than 
usual, 2=have no sense

Study 
evaluations  Subjects will be followed for symptoms and signs of infection (until study day 2 8), 
adverse events (any AEs: until study day 14, SAEs: until study day 2 8), and viral shedding 
(daily from study day 1 to 10).   
Statistical 
plan  • The primary analysis population is the mITT population , which includes all 
randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of study drug  (excluding subjects who 
qualified for enrollment  solely based on changes in smell or taste) .  For the primary 
efficacy endpoint of time to sustained clinical recovery, group sample sizes of 
approximately 625 subjects in each treatment arm (favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836002]) will 
achieve sufficient power to demons trate a clinically meaningful difference using a 
two-sided Wilcoxon test at a n overall  significance level of 0.0 5.  
• An interim analysis will be performed to a ssess the safety of the patients, the efficacy 
endpoint for futility, the efficacy endpoint for treatment effect, and the progress of the 
trial and any medical consideration required to support patient’s health and safe ty.  
The nominal alpha of 0.02 and of 0.0369,  at the time of interim an d final analysis, 
respec tively. A p -value less than 0.02 (interim) or 0.0369  (final) will be considered to 
be statistically significant . Futility will be concluded at interim on the primary efficacy 
endpoint if Z-value is smaller than 0.[ZIP_CODE] (i.e. p-value is larger than 0.6389).  
• For the viral shedding endpoint of time to undetectable viral shedding, group sample 
sizes of [ADDRESS_1160875] at a significance level of 0.05 .

3.1 Study R ationale  
The ongoing COVID -19 pandemic is an urgent public health crisis with few if any rapid and practical 
solutions.  The outbreak of COVID -19 has been declared to be a public health emergency of international 
concern by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO), and the development of effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519193] -
spreading fatal COVID -19 is in an urgent need  [1]. Given the seriousness and time -sensitive nature of this 
highly contagious virus, the medical and scientific communities must work quickly and effi ciently to find 
a feasible way to address this global emergency.   
COVID -[ADDRESS_1160887] impactful early during 
COVID -19, when no or mild symptoms are present.   
Unlike remdesivir, which is available only as IV and is therefore mostly limited to patients with severe 
COVID -19 that require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836005] a tablet  form and can be used  also in 
outpatients with asymptomatic or mild infection  [2].  Progression from mild to severe COVID -19 is more 
frequent among older persons and those with certain underlying comorbidities.  [3]. As a result, such 
populations contribute unproportionally to death  from COVID -19 [4]. The ability to mitigate  COVID -[ADDRESS_1160888] many lives. In addition, early effective treatment is expe cted to shorten and reduce 
viral shed ding [5].  Viral shedding in patients with symptomatic COVID -19 typi[INVESTIGATOR_836006] 4-15 
days, and sometimes > 15 days. During  this period, patients are considered to be  infectious. Shortening the 
duration of viral shedding may decrease the risk of progression to severe COVID -19 and diminish the 
period of infectivity, thus possibly decreasing the number of secondary cases. Two small  studies from 
China demonstrated that favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836007] -19 [6-7]. 
 
3.2 Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] : The study drug   
At the time of writing, definitive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_836008] -[ADDRESS_1160889] COVID -19.  Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836009] a purine 
nucleoside analogue, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of RNA -dependent RNA polymerase  [8-10]. I t 
has activity against influenza A and B including activity against oseltamivir and z anamivir -resistant 
influenza viruses, several agents of viral hemorrhagic fever, a nd SARS -CoV -2 in vitro  [11-13].

required as compared to chloroquine or remdesivir (EC50 = 61.88 μM)  [15].  D espi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a similarly elevated 
EC50 identified for favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836013], it was identified in [ADDRESS_1160890] -exposure prophylaxis for mice exposed to an Ebola virus challenges, with rapid virologic 
response preventing mortality  [16- 18}.  Based on the dosing strategies and pharmacokinetic data from 
human influenza trials, a n intensified dosing strategy of 6000 mg loading on day 1 followed by 1200 mg

Protocol: ATI0220  Version: 5.1 Dated: 02-November-2021 Page 19 of 63 PO BID maintenance therapy for 10 days was employed in a single -arm clinical trial for Ebola virus 
disease in Guinea  [19]. 
In a retrospective analysis of 124 patients with Ebola v irus disease in Sierra Leone, those treated with 
favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836014] a significantly higher survival rate compared to patients receiving suppor tive management 
(56% v. 35.3%, p=0.027)  [20].  Patients received favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] [ADDRESS_1160891] -exposure prophylaxis for Ebola virus disease  [21].  
In a case series of four healthcare workers with higher risk Ebola virus exposures, i ncluding two hollow -
bore needle stick injuries, none of the patients who received 10 days of high -dose favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836015].  
Early clin ical experience with favipi[INVESTIGATOR_835992] -19 is promising. An open -label nonrandomized trial 
of 80 patients with COVID -19 in China identified a significant reduction in the time to SARS -CoV -2 viral 
clearance in patients treated with favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836016] t o historical controls treated with 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir [6].  Patients with mild or moderate COVID -19 were enrolled within 7 days from 
disease onset; those with severe or critical disease, ≥ 75 years ol d, chronic liver disease, or end -stage renal 
disease we re excluded. Patients in the intervention arm received Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] 1600 mg PO BID on da y 1 
followed by 600 mg PO BID on days 2 -14. Both arms were co -treated with inhaled IFN - α1b 60 μg BID 
and therapy was continued until viral clearance, up to a maximum of  14 days. Thirty -five patients were 
assigned to favipi[INVESTIGATOR_336142] 45 patients to lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, with a median age of 47 ( IQR 35.8 -61); 
13.7% were ≥ 65 years old. There was a significant reduc tion in the median time to viral clearance with 
favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] (4 days; IQR 2.5 -9) as compared to lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir (11 days; IQR 8 -13; p <0.001). Further, 
by [CONTACT_4475] 14, 91.4% of patients in the favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836017] 62.2% of the 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir arm. There was a significantly lower rate  of adverse events in patients receiving 
favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] (11.4% v. 55.6%, p<0.01).  
In an open -label randomized trial in China, 240 patients with confirmed COVID -19 were randomized to 
favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836018]  [7].  Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836019] [ADDRESS_1160892] patients re ceiving 
favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654], albeit not achieving statistical significance (61.21% v. 51.67%, p= 0.1396). Amongst patients 
with moderately se vere disease, there was a significantly higher rate of clinical recovery by [CONTACT_4475] 7 wi th 
favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] (71.43% v. 55.86%).  
Top- line results are also available from an open- label , randomized, multicenter clinical trial  recently 
conducted in [ADDRESS_1160893] 
supportive care. Randomization was stratified based on disease severity into mild ( 90 patients) and 
moderate (60 patients).  The median time to cessation of oral viral shedding was  28.6% faster in the 
intervention arm although  the difference was not statistically significant  (Hazard Ratio 1.367 [95%CI 
0.944,1.979]; p=0.129).   Patients receiving favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836020] . No serious adverse events or deaths were reported in the 
intervention arm.   Full study r esult s have not yet been published.

5.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
Randomized , double blind , placebo control (RDBPC) studies provide the strongest possible evidence of 
causation.  Phase II I trials are used to expand on Phase II research of the efficacy and safety of an 
intervention in subject s with the disease for which a new intervention is proposed.  Randomization in 
combination with blinding helps to avoid possible bias in the selection of subject s, their assignment to an 
intervention or control, and the analysis of their response to the intervention.   
 
5.3 Dose Justification and Tablet s needed  
5.3.1 Justification for Dose  
Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836033] 12 hours. The dosage for favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836034] 1800 mg ( 9 tablet s of 200  mg) orally for the first 2 doses, then 800 mg orally approximately every 12 
hours to complete days 2-10 of therapy. Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836035] 200 mg tablets and dosed orally. 
Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836036] 2 00 mg immediate release 
tablets. Although discouraged, i f necessary, favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836037] n and can be

Protocol: ATI0220  Version: 5.1 Dated: 02-November-2021 Page 25 of 63 taken with or without food  [24-25 ].  This dosing strategy is increased from the licensed dosing regimen 
for influenza, to account for the higher in -vitro concentrations required for activity against SARS -CoV -2. 
Elevated dosing strategies, up to 6000 mg on day 1 followed by 1200 mg BID has been used in published 
Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836038]  [26].  Prolonged administration to 22 days has been explored in a phase 1 
study in Japan (JP120) with a favorable safety profile (patients received 1800 mg P O BID on day 1 
followed by 800 mg PO BID from day 2 -21 and a single dose of 800 mg on day 22).  
 
5.3.2 Number of tablet s required for the entire study  
For a 10-day course: 1800 mg ( 9 tablet s of 200 mg) x2 doses (a total of 18 tablet s), then 800 mg ( 4 tablet s) 
x2 daily doses until study day 10  (8 tablet s per day to complete 10 days of therapy)  for a total of [ADDRESS_1160921] for the entire study period. Tablet s required for dosing of the entire study population  per 
treatment arm will be  56,250 ([ADDRESS_1160922]).  
Considering competitive enrol lment involving multiple countries and sites, it is very critical to maintain 
sufficient quantity of IPs at each IP depot and participating sites. Hence, it woul d require to add -on 
approximately 5 0% contingency quantity.  This will make up to total approx imately  85,000 tablets for the 
entire study  per each treatment arm .  
 
5.4 Dosing in Special Populations  
Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836039] -bearing age 
who are not taking oral contraception due to its potential teratogenicity. No alte ration of dosing is needed 
in subjects with renal impairment. Total exposur e for plasma favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836040] (Stage 4) was 1.[ADDRESS_1160923] of renal impairment on safety was observed and favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836041] g enerally well tole rated 
in subjects with renal impairment.  
No alterations in dosing strategies are required in older adults. The maximum pla sma concentration and 
AUC values in elderly subjects in a single and a multiple -dose study completed in Japan were higher than 
in young subjects. Comparing AUC values on Day 5, the differences were 40 and 80% after 600 mg once 
a day and 400 mg BID, respectively. In the companion study completed in the [LOCATION_002] of Ame rica, 
there were no differences between young and older populations  based on Day 5 AUC comparison in 
subjects receiving either 600 or 800 mg BID.

5.7 Expected Side Effects  
Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836026] a safe drug. No treatment related serious adverse event s occurred in licensure 
studies of favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654]  [2].  The most common adverse events observed in clinical trials are gastrointestinal 
(diarrhea 2.3%; nausea 2.1%). A similar proportion of subjects in the placebo (25.4%)  and favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] 
(25.3%) groups experienced at least 1 adverse event. Further , favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836044].  
 
5.8 Additional Safety Considerations  
For the purpose of  this trial, the following are exclusion criteria for study drug administration:  
1) Subject has a history of hypersensitivity to favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654]  
2) Known uncompensated hepatic cirrhosis.   
3) Current use of the following medications, which cannot be discontinued for the duration of t he 
study: pyrazinamide, hydralazine, more than 3000 mg of acetaminophen per day.  
 
The following safety considerations are based on data from individuals taking fav ipi[INVESTIGATOR_836045]. 
They are listed here for reference.  
• Phototoxicity: Nonclinical studies have shown mild phototoxicity. One study subject experie nced 
mild photosensitivity (rash) following a tanning bed session. All subjects should avoid exces sive 
exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light.  
• Laboratory Values: Mild to moderate asymptomatic elevations of uric acid and aminotr ansferase 
have been observed in healthy volunteers and subjects with influenza  [2] treated with favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836046]. The changes have been reversible upon favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836047].  
• Mutagenesis: Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836048]. Althoug h the 
potential for genotoxicity at high exposures cannot be ruled out, evidence indicates that this risk 
is minimal at the exposures planned in this clinical study.  
• GI Tract Lesions: In two proof -of-concept studies of orally administered favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836049], GI tract lesions were observed that were not consis tent with the known 
natural history of Ebola nor with previous animal and clinical studies of favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654]. H owever, 
evidence suggests that bacterial infections and pre -existing enterocolitis in the treated macaques 
may have been responsible, and an ongoing risk to subject s may not exist.  
• Contraception:

Acceptable contraceptive methods for female subjects of childbearing potential inc lude one of the 
following:  
1. Abstinence.  
2. One of the following methods:  
− Tubal ligation  4 or more weeks prior to randomization  
− Copper- containing intrauterine device (IUD).  
− Condom AND spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.  
− Male partner who has had a vasectomy for at least 6 month s.  Male partners with 
vasectomies of <6 months are NOT considered protected.  
− Hormonal contraceptives (oral, injected, transdermal or implanted).  The subj ect 
must remain on the treatment throughout the study and must have been using 
hormonal contraceptives for an adequate period to ensure effectiveness (3 months  
prior to randomization or longer ). 
 
Females of Non -Childbearing Potential   
Female subjects of non -childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following criteria:  
1. Postmenopausal females  (Not menstruating for at least one year ) 
2. Females who have a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy.

Saliva collection, storage, and shipment procedure:  
Subjects will be trained by a study team member of the technique of saliva collection.  Saliva collection 
will be observed by [CONTACT_118734].  
1) Saliva will be collected into an empty sterile mL -marked tube (lacking preservatives or buffers).  
2) The subject will wash hands before opening the test package.  
3) Within [ADDRESS_1160947] will avoid eating, drinking, s moking, 
chewing gum, or brushing their teeth.  
4) The subject will spit their saliva into the tube until the saliva reaches the black line on  the tube (2 
ml).  
5) The subject will remove funnel and screw on cap to release blue preservation agent in to the tube.  
6) The subject will place the specimen in the provided biohazard bag. Seal the biohazard ba g by 
[CONTACT_836106]. Wipe the bag with the provided alcohol wipe. Wash hands thoroughly 
again.  
7) The subject will keep the tube at room temperature.  
8) Saliva tubes collected on study days 1 -5 (4 x 24 -hour periods are required to complete their 
collection) will be shipped on study day 5  (+1) from the subject’s home to the central laboratory.  
9) Saliva tubes collected on study days 6 -10 will be collected by a study team member on study day 
10 (+1) and shipped to the central laboratory.

7.7.7 Specimen Testing  
The specimens will be tested to identify RNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_270789] -CoV2 by [CONTACT_3553] a semi -quantitative 
RT-PCR technique using FDA approved ‘Saliva  Direct’ testing protocol.34 For quantitation of RNA in 
the specimen - as there is no FDA -approved quantitative RT-PCR for SARS -CoV2, we will be u sing the 
following methodology:  
 
1) The PCR CT counts will be documented for each specimen ,  
2) To estimate RNA viral loads from CT counts, external controls with known RNA load  will be 
used,  
3) The controls will be PCR tested and their CT count will be correlated to their know R NA load ,  
 
PRESECO  Confidential Appi[INVESTIGATOR_835988].  
Protocol: ATI0220  Version: 5.1 Dated: 02-November-2021 Page 37 of 63 4) These data will be used to create a validated curve associating CT counts to RNA load,  
5) The curve will be used to estimate RNA loads in specimens from trial subjects.

9.3.1 Definition of Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is defined as any unanticipated medical occurrence regardless to relationship of the investigative 
arm of the trial. An AE can be any unintended sign, lab abnormality, symptom, or disease a ssociated with 
the trial. Any abnormality that presents during a medical test are to be defin ed as an AE if it produce s 
clinical signs and/or symptoms, requires intervention, or deemed clinically si gnificant by [CONTACT_737].

The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will  be utilized for AE 
reporting the following study- specific AEs: 
• Cough 
• Dyspnea 
• Hypoxia 
• Nausea  
• Vomiting  
• Abdominal pain  
• Pruritus 
• Loss of appetite  
• Dizziness

• persistent or  significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions  
• Medically important event by [CONTACT_737]  (including any E D visit)  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34502], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the s ubject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
9.3.4 Definition of Unexpected Adverse Reaction (UAE)  
An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the  applicable product 
information (e.g.  Product Information/Summary of  Product Characteristics). This would include any SAE  
on health or safety, any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a drug; or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a drug that rel ates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects.  
 
9.3.5 Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an inter vention in 
humans, whether  (or not) considered intervention -related ( ICH E6( R2), Section 1.2 ). 
 
9.3.6 Classification of an Adverse E vent 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Event  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_836114] V. 5.0 . Investigator or qualified 
designee will assess the severity of AEs using the following categories:  
• Grade 1:   Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only;  
intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2 :   Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated  
• Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836073]   
• Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Relationshi p to Study Intervention  
Relationship to Study Products : All AEs must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_836115]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded usi ng the categories 
below.

Protocol: ATI0220  Version: 5.1 Dated: 02-November-2021 Page 44 of 63  
Definitely:  
 The relationship of the AE and the drug or the study procedure can be established.  
 
Probably:  
 While a clear relationship to the drug or to the study procedure cannot be 
established, the AE is associated with an expected AE or there is no other medical 
condition or intervention, which could explain the occurrence of such an event.  
 
Possibly:  
 There is no clear relationship between the AE and the drug or study procedure; 
however, one cannot conclude that there is no relationship.  
 
Unrelated:  
 There is no relationship between the AE and the drug or study procedure.  This 
may include but is not limited to the incident being an expected outcome of a 
previously existing or concurrent disease, concomitant medication or procedure 
the subject  experience d. 
 
 
9.3.7 Expectedness  
Study T eam members who are  clinically  qualified  (e.g., a physician , co-Investigator , sub -Investigator) 
will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE wi ll be considered 
unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the r isk information 
previously described for the study products. Th is information will be provided to the IRB /IEC , and to any 
relevant governmental agency with regulatory or public health authority.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
10.1 Statistical Hypotheses  
The primary efficacy objective of this study is to demonstrate that treatment with favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836076] -19 and mild -to-moderate symptoms will shorten the time to sustained clinical recovery ("c omponent of the 
clinical outcome").” Primary efficacy endpoint: Time to sustained clinic al recovery, defined as the time (number of 
days) from the start of the study treatment until symptom relief , evaluated from study day [ADDRESS_1160976].  
  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
10.2.1 Sample Size Determination: study’s primary endpoint: time to sustained clinical recovery by [CONTACT_836117] 2 8 
Group sample sizes of approximately 62 5 in each treatment group ( Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836002])  to get at least 
[ADDRESS_1160977] at an overall  significance level of 0.05.

Protocol: ATI0220  Version: 5.1 Dated: 02-November-2021 Page 47 of 63 10.2.2 Sample Size Justification : study’s p rimary endpoint: time to sustained clinical recovery by [CONTACT_563152] 2 8 
A review of the medical literature including descriptive and intervention studies r eveals variation in the 
estimate of ‘median time to symptom alleviation’. There is lack of consistency among stu dies in regard 
to: 1) the definition used for ‘symptom alleviation’, 2) the reference time point (som e use the day of first 
symptoms, the day of first positive PCR test, the day of study enrollment, and the day of hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
3) the length of follow up. To account for the uncertainty surrounding the estimate of  ‘median time to 
symptom alleviation’, we performed a series of intermediate sample size calculations for a variety of likely 
scenarios  with median times to sustained clinical recovery for the control group ranging  from 3 to 15 days 
and median times to sustained clinical recovery for the favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836077] -1 to -6 days (when 
possible) as compared to the control group. The worst case of those scenarios was r etained to establish the 
definitive sample size estimation for the trial . 
The definiti ve sample size assessment is based on a group sequential design  with a possibility to stop for 
efficacy and for futility (unbinding rule) at interim, once 45% of the information is obtai ned (i.e. 367  
events ), using Power family (Phi=1.147) alpha and beta spending functions. Assuming proporti onal 
hazards, a median time of 5 days in the control group vs. a median time of 4 days in t he favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836078] 
(which provide a hazards ratio of 1.25) and controlling for an overall alpha of 5% (two -sided), it is 
estima ted that about 475 participants per group would be required to obtain a total of 815 clinical events  
(defined as clinical recoveries) . This will ensure a power of 85 % to detect a difference between the two 
groups in terms of time to clinical recoveries by [CONTACT_2006] 28.  
 
The unbinding futility rule uses a Power family beta spending function with Phi=1.147  and the probability 
to stop for futility at interim when there is no difference between  the two groups (i.e. HR=1) is 73 %.  
 
The test for efficacy at interim uses a Power family alpha spending function with Phi=1.[ADDRESS_1160978] ratio is truly 1.25, the probability to conclud e efficacy at interim is 49 %. 
  
This is to be noted that the futility rule is unbinding and that the recommendations whether or not to st op 
for futility will be done by [CONTACT_39109] (DSMB) (see secti on 5.5), upon review 
of the safety and efficacy data, and not solely based o n the futility rule.  
10.2.3 Sample Size Determination: Sub- study’s Viral Shedding Endpoint: Time to undetectable viral 
shedding by [CONTACT_53813] 10 
Group sample sizes of approximately 2 75 subjects in each treatment group (Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836002]) in 
order to obtain [ADDRESS_1160979] at a significance level of 
0.05. 
10.2.4 Sample Size Justification:  Sub- study’s Viral Shedding Endpoint: Time to undetectable viral 
shedding by [CONTACT_53813] 10  
To calculate the requ ired sample size, we used the following assumptions: 1) Follow -up duration per 
patient of 10 days, 2) Alpha of 0.05, 3) Lost to follow up of 0, 4) Exponential survival rates, 5) M edian

of 5 vs. 2.9 days in the control vs. favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836078], respectively (HR = 1.7), it is e stimated that a total 
of about 550 subjects ( 275 per treatment group) in order to obtain 112 clinical events defined as 
undetectable viral shedding events would be required to achieve a power of 80%.

• Per-Protocol Analysis Dataset: subset of the subject s in the mITT2 set who took at least 80% of 
study intervention and had no protocol violations that would affect the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Such protocol violations include treatment with high dose steroids, remdesivir, or S ARS -CoV -2 
monoclonal antibodies.

10.4 Statistical Analyses : General Approach  
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics and other results will be summar ized using descriptive 
summary statistics. Data collected in the trial will be summari zed overall and by [CONTACT_2939].  
Survival analysis techniques will be used to analyze the time -to-event variables. Failure curves will be 
constructed for time to positive event using Kaplan -Meier estimates. Time to sustained clinical recovery 
will be com pared using a Gehan Wilcoxon test  which gives more weight to early events . Time to a 
negative event (such as time to death, time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be compared using t he Log-rank test 
for comparison of survival distributions.  Summary tables for safety and efficacy endpoints will include 
event rates (Kaplan -Meier estimates of event rates), relative risk, confidence interval for the relat ive risk, 
the difference in means/rates, the confidence interval for difference in means/rates , and the p -value.  
For categorical variables, results within each arm will be summarized with subject  counts, percentages, 
and 95% confidence intervals. The differences between the two treatment arms wil l be summarized with 
the difference in percentages and the asymptotic 95% confidence interval for the dif ference of two 
percentages.

10.5 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
For the primary efficacy endpoint,  time to sustained clinical recovery  from study day [ADDRESS_1160981].  
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be based on the Modified Intent to Treat 
Population (mITT) , defined as any subject randomized into the study and took at least on dose of study 
medication  (excluding subjects who qualified for enrollment based upon changes in taste and smell) .  
Additional primary efficacy endpoint analyses will also be performed using  the mITT,  mITT2, and the 
Per Protocol populations . Every effort will be made to ensure that subjects are followed until 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], death , or [ADDRESS_1160982] not met the primary endpoint in the primary analysis.   
 
10.6 Analysis of the Key Secondary Endpoint(s)  
Proportion of subjects with COVID -[ADDRESS_1160983] as applicable . The 
corresponding confidence interval for the difference in propor tions will be calculated.  
Viral shedding sub -study ( time in number of days to negative conversion of detectable SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1160984] 
viral assessment ) will be analyzed using time -to event methods . 
All secondary endpoint analyses will be performed for the mITT , mITT2  and PP populations .   
Adjustment for multiple te sting will be performed to control the overall type 1 error to no more than 5% 
for the interim and final analysis on the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Moreover, for labeling purposes, a hierarchical approach will be used to control the ove rall type 1 error to  
≤ 5% for the primary and key secondary endpoints. The order of testing wi ll be:  
1. Clinical recovery  
2. Broad progression (key secondary endpoint)  
3. Narrow progression (key secondary endpoint)  
Statistical significance cannot be claimed if the parameter on top of the parameter being tested did not 
reach statistical significance. For example, if clinical recovery was not statis tically significant at final 
analysis, the other parameters will not be considered as having reached statistical  significance (no matter 
the results obtained). If clinical recovery reaches statistical significance at final  analysis and Broad 
progression (key secondary endpoint) does not, the remaining parameters will not be considered a s 
having reached statistical significance and so on.  
10.6.1  Additional Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The additional secondary endpoint of time to negative conversion of positive SARS -CoV -2 (viral 
culture assays of saliva) will be analyzed as described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP  version 3.1 ).

11.0 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Regulatory, Ethical , and Study Oversight Considerations.    
11.1.1 Informed Consent Process  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Consent/assent and Other Informational Documents Provided to subject s 
Consent describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks will be  provided to the 
subject  and documentation of informed consent will be  required prior to  administering study intervention s.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Consent Procedures and Documentation  
Informed consent (IC) is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the  
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. The investigator will explai n the 
research study to the subject  and answer any questions that may arise.  The explanation will be provided 
 
PRESECO  Confidential Appi[INVESTIGATOR_835988].  
Protocol: ATI0220  Version: 5.1 Dated: 02-November-[ADDRESS_1160992] ’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study 
and of their rights as research subject s.  Potential subject s will have the opportunity to ask question s. The 
subject s will have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about i t 
prior to agreeing to participate. They will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may 
withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice. The rights and welfare of the subject s will be 
protecte d by [CONTACT_836118].  
 
FDA regulations generally require that the informed consent of a trial subject  be documented by [CONTACT_144601] a written consent form that has been approved by [CONTACT_1201] /IEC  and signed and dated by [CONTACT_836119] (21 CFR 50.27(a)). Considering COVID -19 infection control measures, if the 
technology is available, current FDA guidance suggests that electronic methods of obtaining informed 
consent should be considered as follows:  
• To ensure that subject s are approached in a consistent fashion, a standard process should be used 
that will accomplish the following:  
1. Identification of who is on the call or telemedicine visit  
2. Review of the I nformed Consent with the subject  by [CONTACT_093] (or their designee) 
and response to any questions the subject  may have  
3. Confirmation by [CONTACT_836120] ’s questions have been answered  
4. Confirmation by [CONTACT_836121]  
5. Verbal confirmation by [CONTACT_836122].  
 
• If the signed informed consent document cannot be collected from  the subject ’s location and 
included in the study records, FDA considers the following option acceptable to provide 
documentation that the subject  signed the informed consent document:  
1. A dated attestation by [CONTACT_836123] r that 
the subject  confirmed that they agreed to participate in the study and signed the informed 
consent. 
For this study involving subject s with COVID -[ADDRESS_1160993].  
• Purpose of the study and the potential risks/benefits of the use of the Investigational A gent 
favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836081] -19 infection will discussed in detail by [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_261959] (PI/ designee)  with the subject prior to obtaining the 
IC.  Opportunity to review the ICF (informed consent form) prior to or during the discussion wi ll 
be provided .  Adequate time for discussion between the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_836082] .  After review of the IC, any questions that the potential subject  have will be 
addressed during or after review of the IC.  
 
• Availability and/or possibility of other potential treatment options will be discusse d with the 
subject .

• A second member of the study team will be present on the phone or video chat during the entire 
discussion. The witness will ask  the p otential subject  if they underst and the contents of the 
discussion and if they ha ve any questions  to address.  The subject  will be informed that they can 
ask questions at any time during the trial.  
 
• The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_836083]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_836084] f orm

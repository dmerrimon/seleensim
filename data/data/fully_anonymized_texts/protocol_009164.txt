Synopsis of study protocol 
This is study seeks to evaluate interventions to improve glucose control and adherence of young 
children and their families using a hybrid closed loop system in the home environment throughout the 
day and night.   
 
We will enroll patients who are in the follow -up/continuation phase of the IRB and FDA approved 
Medtronic CEP302 study (IDE# G150247 , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). Subjects in this study are using the  Medtronic 
670G hybrid closed loop insulin delivery system, but have completed the trial period of the protocol.  
 
This protocol is the addition of an educational /behavioral  intervention (described below)  designed to 
optimize their use of the hybrid closed l oop system for their diabetes control. This is not a device 
intervention, and no IDE is required (since all subjects aree enrolled in the Medtornic CEP302 study ).  
 
This adaptive study design employs  the possibility of subsequent randomizations if pre -designated 
targets are not reached. All participants will be ages 2-6 years old and in the continuation phase of 
the Medtronic CEP 302 Trial using the Medtronic MiniMed 670G pump with Guardian 3 sensor.  All 
subjects will receive the same standardized education on using the pump with hybrid closed loop 
capabilities and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)  during the initial Medtronic CEP [ADDRESS_418702] as the y enter the extension phase of the study which is 
the beginning of this study. Their uploaded data will be reviewed every two weeks and if they are not 
meeting adherence (≥ 70% of the time in closed -loop) and glycemic target goals (≥ 65% of sensor 
values between 70 - 180 mg/dL), they will be randomized to six interventions: 1) reduce psychological 
distress, 2) reduce worries about hypoglycemia, 3) education and understanding of  developmental 
and technologic demands for using hybrid closed loop this age group, 4) understanding and 
modification of carbohydrate to insulin ratios,  set point and in depth nutritional education, and 
interventions 5) and 6) will be minimal interventions with a text message providing information on how 
they are doing at meeting their targets.  All these interventions will be compared to a minimal 
intervention (text of their results compared to target goals). We will examine group differences over a 
3-month period on health and psychological outcomes at baseline and after three months. 
 Objectives:  The objective of this study is to assess several remote interventions with families in the 
extension phase of the 670G toddler study to determine which interventions are most effective in 
improving their time in target (70-180 mg/dl) and their adherence in maintaining closed -loop control 
(at least 70% of the time in closed-loop).  
Sample Size:   
• We anticipate enrolling at least [ADDRESS_418703] 30 subjects.  A sample size of 26 subjects should allow 
for a statistically significant result with a power of 0. 9 and a p of 0.05.  Enrollment of 30 
subjects would allow for a 10% drop out rate.  See Biostatistics and Data Analysis section.  
 
Sample size and power calculations were conducted with consideration of a clinically 
meaningful change in the primary outcome – percent time in target range – and the  feasibility of 
enrolling participants from the continuation phase of the 670G trial. Each site has the potential to 
enroll up to [ADDRESS_418704] that 70 to 80% would opt for the continuation phase and to be enrolled in the proposed study.

 The primary outcome is the percent change in the amount of time spent in the target glucose 
range from baseline (prior to automated glucose control) to study completion. Data from our CGM 
study with toddlers (NIDDK funded DP3; Buckingham PI) show that of the sixteen 2-6 year-olds in the 
study, they  achieve on average only 45% time in 70 -180 mg/dL target range (standard deviation = 
15%). Our hypothesized change will be a 10% improvement in time spent in target range. There is 
sufficient power) to detect this change in a sample size of 26. Another aspect of calculating power in 
this study is the actual number of participants exposed to the planned interventions after a glucose 
“failure.” Over 90% of the participants in our DP3 toddler study experienced a glucose failure of less 
than 60% time in target range. Further, the table below shows the results of glucose failures from the DirectNet cohort of toddlers using CGM (Ped Diabetes 13:301 -7, 2012) .

Study Procedures 
 
Participants will be recruited at  5 centers: Stanford University, the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, 
University of Colorado (referred to as Denver), Yale University, Indiana University, and University of South [LOCATION_012]. We expect to enroll [ADDRESS_418705] roughly equal enrollment at 
each site (ie.  4 to 8 at each site). Only families who have completed the Medtronic CEP 302 Trial and 
opt to participate in the continuation phase will be eligible for this study . Study staff will approach 
potential participants to explain the study, determine eligibilit y, and obtain informed consent.  
 
The study design is adaptive, specifically a SMART (sequential multiple assignment randomization 
trial). A SMART is an adaptive study design that allows for multiple assessments and based on the results of those assessments, a menu of interventions can be deplo yed. To ensure that there is no 
bias when interventions are delivered, and to have a test of whether those who receive the intervention fare better (or worse) from those who do not receive the intervention, a randomization 
strategy is used. The decision to use a SMART was primarily made because this is what happens 
clinically – a child (and family) start on a system with a certain dose of education and when problems 
arise, the clinical team offers interventions to optimize their use of the system. The SMART  allows us 
to test which interventions are best for this patient population that presents many unique challenges for diabetes management and coordinated care from the team.    
 All participants will complete a checkpoint visit every 2 weeks for the duration of 3  months. At each 
checkpoint in the study (weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10), data from the preceding [ADDRESS_418706] been “failures.” Data will be av ailable through pump uploads and by [CONTACT_338690]. Objective data will guide determination of failures. We are defining failure in the following ways:  
 1) Adherence Failure:  defined as using the hybrid closed loop “Auto Mode”  less than 70% 
during a week 2) Glucose Failure:  defined as less than 65% time spent in glucose range of 70 - 180 mg/dL.  
 If subjects pass both the adherence and glucose targets, no intervention is required. If there is an 
Adherence Failure, they will be eligible for an adherence intervention. The adherence interventions 
[ADDRESS_418707]. We decided that an adherence failure trumps 
a glucose failure because using the Auto Mode function is critical to opening the door to achieving 
glucose targets.  
 
The figure below shows t he possibilities at each 2-week checkpoint.

Figure 1 above graphically depi[INVESTIGATOR_338686]. Below, the 
conditions and possible scenarios are described in more detail. As a reminder, there are five 
checkpoints (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks). At each checkpoint, here are the possible scenarios. A = adherence; G = glucose range; and R = randomization below:  
 
1. If 1
st A failure, R to A1, A2, or A3 
2. If 2nd A failure (ie., there was a previous A failure), and a history of A3, R to A1 or A2  
3. If 2nd A failure, with history of (respectively) A1(A2) give A2(A1).  
4. If A success, 1st G failure, R to G1,G2,G3 
5. If A success, 2nd G failure, w/ history of G3, R to G1,G2 
6. If A success, 2nd G failure, w/history of (respectively) G1(G2) give G2(G1).  
7. All else, no treatment. 
 As noted above, an Adherence Failure is defined as use of Auto Mode for less than 70% of the time 
at a checkpoint. A Glucose Failure is defined as spending less than 65% of the time in the 70 - 180 
mg/dL range at a checkpoint. Also note that the final visit at 3 months is the end of the study and no 
interventions are offered at that study visit.

Optimize Adherence Interventions 
 
Below are brief descriptions of the interventions.  
 Developmental and Technological Demands Intervention   
6 
  
There are no existing interventions that target the uptake and promotion of diabetes technology for 
parents of young children with T1D. Further, no interventions provide education and skill-building on 
how to use these devices and technologies across multiple settings (e.g., school, home, social activities) and by [CONTACT_338691] (e.g., direct monitoring vs. remote monitoring). Becoming more 
comfortable with using these devices  (specifically the Medtronic 670G pump and Guardian 3 sensor) 
in multiple settings should help to promote adherence to device use. We will continue to take advantage of several important themes. First, those individuals with more comfort with technology  in 
general (e.g., smartphones and computers), are more comfortable and better equipped when using specific technology for managing health. Second, mobile technologies (apps and text messaging, for 
example) and programs that support the use of diabetes tec hnologies are effective in increasing 
adherence to management tasks. The third theme and necessary component of this intervention will be to teach a brief 3-step rubric for solving problems: 1) identify the problem, 2) chose a solution 
decided on by [CONTACT_338692], and 3) monitor for results at the next session. These 
sessions will specifically address some of the difficulties with keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a child in Auto Mode. They will cover the most common reasons for getting kicked out of Auto Mode and d iscuss strategies to 
maximize the time spent in Auto Mode. The Developmental and Technological Demands intervention 
will include two ≈30-minute sessions.  
 Distress Reduction Intervention 
  
Many parents of young children with T1D express worries, fears, concerns, and distress over many aspects of diabetes management. The Distress Reduction intervention targets 1) the identification of 
and reduction of parent anxiety/depressive symptoms (gener al and diabetes -specific) and 2) 
increasing access to and attainment of social support. It will also be delivered in two ≈30-minute 
sessions online (or over the phone if online is not available) . Multi-media approaches will also be 
used in this session. We recognize this dose of an intervention is not intended to completely remove all parent fears and worries, nor will it fully connect them to a network of support. However, it is 
intended to reduce fears/worries and provide avenues for obtaining support tha t do enough  to help 
them maintain adherence diabetes devices.  
 
 
Glucose Targets Interventions 
 
Below are brief descriptions of the interventions.   Each intervention will be recorded using Blue Jeans 
to capture the  content delivered and duration of the inte rvention. 
 
Nutrition, Set point, and carbohydrate/Insulin Intervention and insulin duration of action 
 
These sessions will focus on how different factors affect blood glucose levels. Education on how 
combinations of proteins, fats and carbohydrates can be used to extend the release of glucose into the body will be discussed. We will also provide training on adjusting carbohydrate to insulin ratios to 
achieve better glycemic control. In addition we will address the target glucose set point of the 670G 
pump and how this can be changed during periods of activity to modulate insulin delivery. We will 
also review and potentially intervene with the duration of insulin action as an adjustable parameter to be ei ther more aggressive or less aggressive with correction doses.  The duration of action can be 
modified to allow more aggressive correction bolus, or to decrease correction doses if there is a risk 
of hypoglycemia.  For young children for whom insulin is gi ven immediately after eating (because the 
amount of food they will eat is unknown), the Quick bolus may be an option.  Each session will last up 
to [ADDRESS_418712] previously used 
the Dexcom share with remote monitoring, we will discuss how they may or may not be using the Dexcom Share for remote monitoring since this feature is not available on the 670G pump.  We will 
review their fears and the child’s past severe hypoglycemic events, and what they have read and heard from friends and support groups. We will teach parents the links between fears/worries and 
diabetes behaviors (e.g., fear may lead to hyper vigilance which in turn causes more stress a nd 
burnout). We will provide behavioral strategies for monitoring for hypoglycemia (and hyperglycemia) at regular intervals, steps to problem solve unexpected high and low blood sugars, and basic efforts 
at sleep hygiene. These sessions have the same forma t (two ≈ 30-minute sessions delivered online  
or over the phone).  
Minimal Intervention 
 
The randomization to minimal intervention will be present in both the Adherence arm and Glucose 
arm. In this intervention the parent will receive either an email or text message that details what 
percentage of the prior two weeks spent in Auto Mode, percentage of time below, within, or above 
target glucose range, and whether they met the study goals for these areas.  If they have concerns 
about their management, they are of course instructed to contact [CONTACT_338693].   
    
 
 
Study Visits and Measurements   
 
In person study visits for all participants will occur at baseline (0 weeks) and [ADDRESS_418713] assessments that  include all measures in table 2 below. Briefer assessments (or 
checkpoints) are completed at 2 weeks intervals. These visits should be within ±1 week  of the 
scheduled visit.  Any behavioral interventions delivered will be done remotely and will not require  an 
in-person visit. All of the questionnaires will be completed online via RedCap.

Schedule  
Stanford IRB approval will be in March, 2017.  Upon entering the extension phase of the toddler 670G study 
subjects will be recruited for this study.  We anticipate this will begin occur between July through August of 
2017.  The study will have a [ADDRESS_418717] of specific 
interventions on improving use of the system and improving glucose control.  In addition, collection of these 
data will allow us to determine personnel demands and timing of interventions worth pursuing in a larger 
clinical trial. Our team has extensive experience in database design and implementation, use of web- based 
assessment, data management, and data analysis. We will utilize the RedCap survey system to format all 
measures in to electronic form for completion online or in -person via computer or iPads. Data collected from 
participants will be housed on the RedCap server, which is encrypted and HIPAA -compliant, with secure 
access for unique study IDs assigned to each participant. RedCap survey data is then ready for download by [CONTACT_338695] 9.3 for data cleaning and analysis.  
Sample size and power calc ulations were conducted with consideration of a clinically meaningful 
change in the primary outcome – percent time in target range – and the feasibility of enrolling participants from 
the continuation trial. Each site has the potential to enroll [ADDRESS_418718] 
that 70 to 80% would opt for the continuation phase and to be enrolled in the proposed study.   
The primary effect we are interested in is percent change in the amount of time spent in the target 
glucose range from  baseline to study completion. Data from our CGM study with toddlers (NIDDK funded DP3; 
Buckingham PI) show that of the sixteen 2 -6 year -olds in the study they achieve , on average,  only 45% time in 
70-180 mg/dL target range (standard deviation = 15%). Our hypothesized change will be a 10% improvement 
in time spent in target range. There is sufficient power ( 0.9) to detect this change in a sample size of 26. 
Another aspect of calculating power in this study is the actual number of participants exposed to the  planned 
interventions after a glucose “failure.” Over 90% of the participants in our DP3 toddler study experienced a 
glucose failure of less than 60% time in target range. Further, the table below shows the results of glucose 
failures from the DirectNet c ohort  of toddlers using CGM (Ped Diabetes 13:301 -7, 2012) .  
 
Table 1.  Expected Failure Rates 
 Months  
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
        
Glucose Failure (not having at least 
65% of readings in the 70 -180 mg/dL 
range)  - 70% 70% 70% 70% 75% 75% 
 
The SMART design of our proposed study allows for randomization to one of 3 conditions when there is 
a glucose failure (2 interventions and 1 control). Because of this, participants can contribute to more than one 
comparison which increases power. This mak es the SMART design very efficient, particularly when examining 
multiple treatment strategies, which is what clinicians do in these cases. Our primary outcome will be Glucose 
Failure, which we expect 80 -90% of participants to experience. W ith [ADDRESS_418719] once to each of the three intervention groups, there is only 73% power to detect a difference of 10% change in time spent in range  for a given intervention.   In 
other words, going from 4 5% time spent in range at baseline to 55% time spent in range at study completion; 
an outcome of 10% change.  Thus, while the percent change in the sample from baseline to the end of the 
continuation phase does appear to be adequately powered  for the group , the testing of individual interventions 
is underpowered. We will proceed with caution when estimating likely effect sizes for each intervention based 
on the results of the planned analyses.   
Our primary outcome will be tested in two  ways. First, by [CONTACT_338696], we can examine outcomes from checkpoint to checkpoint. For example, we can test percent change in time spent in range from week [ADDRESS_418720] sizes for a larger efficacy trial conducted after this proposed resea rch is completed.

Miscellaneous Considerations 
 
Benefits  
 
It is expected that this protocol will yield knowledge about the impact of closed -loop insulin pump on families 
with young children with type 1 diabetes. The introduction of a closed- loop system  might allay  parents’ fears, 
ease their sense of diabetes- related distress and foreboding, and imp act glycemic variables, however  there is 
no guarantee of any benefit from participating in this research study.  
 
 Subject compensation  
 There will be no cost to the subjects to participate in this research study. P arents will receive $50 for each of 
two surveys, completed at the enrollment and final visits . In total, a family can receive $[ADDRESS_418724] igations involving not 
involving greater than minimal risk  
 Devices  
 
There are no study devices other than those used in the IRB and FDA approved Medtronic CEP302 study 
(IDE# G150247 , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] )

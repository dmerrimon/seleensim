Title: Pair 2 Care: Peer Support for Caregivers of African Americans Living with  Dementia  
 
I. Objective   
 
The purpose  of this study is to test a peer support intervention  for family caregivers who are caring 
for a loved one living with dementia . Peer Support for Caregivers of African Americans Living with 
Dementia  (Pair  2 Care)  is a co-created culturally sensitive family caregiver peer support 
intervention . We will determine if Pair  2 Care is feasible and acceptable by [CONTACT_410711], recruitment and retention data, protocol adherence, satisfaction, and feedback on 
appropriateness  of the intervention  for broader dissemination. At 6 months as compared to 
baseline, current family caregivers will report less anxiety and depression, higher quality of life, 
perceived social support, and self -efficacy for surrogate decision making as well as intent to use 
palliative care or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410674] . 
 
Throughout this protocol the terms ‘caregivers’ or ‘family caregivers’ will be used interchangeably 
to refer to family caregiver participants. Unless otherwise specified, both terms will be used to 
reference current and former family caregiver participants . Former family caregivers are ‘mentors ’ 
and current family caregivers are ‘mentees'  and t hey referred to as such throughout this proposal . 
Study participants are current family caregivers (mentees) and former family caregivers 
(mentors). No professional, hired, formal caregivers such as nurses, physicians, and nursing 
assistants are included in the study. The terms Black and African American are also used 
interchangeably  to represent Blacks residing in the US who are descend ants of Sub-Saharan 
Africa.  
 
II. Background and Rationale  
 
African Americans are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias 
(ADRD) than their White counterparts.[ADDRESS_517998] expressed the need for person -centered, non -judgmental,  
on-demand, culturally congruent caregiving support for advance care planning and healthcare  
decision making. Simultaneously, our former family caregivers retrospectively describe d 
Study  Protocol # 2023B 71  Date of IRB Approval:  6-30-2023  
  Version Date:  1-15-[ADDRESS_517999] a  peer support  intervention  for family  caregivers who are caring for a loved 
one living with dementia . Peer Support for Caregivers of African Americans  Living with Dementia 
(Pair  2 Care)  is a co-created  culturally sensitive  caregiver peer support intervention . The following 
specific aims will be addressed:  
 
Aim 1: Conduct feasibility and acceptability testing of Pair  2 Care in current (n=15) and trained 
former  (n=15) African American ADRD family caregiver peers  paired based on congruent identity 
traits  (e.g., relationship to care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], gender identity, etc.). We will determine if  Pair 2 Care is 
feasible  and acceptable by [CONTACT_410712], recruitment and retention data, protocol  
adherence, satisfaction, and feedback on  appropriateness of the intervention  for broader 
dissemination.  
 
Aim 2: Assess preliminary  intervention  outcomes of caregiver anxiety, depression, quality of life, 
social  support, self -efficacy for surrogate decision making, and intent to use palliative care or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410675]  2 Care Intervention . At 6 months 
as compared  to baseline, current caregivers (mentees) will report less anxiety and depression, 
higher quality of life,  perceived social support, and self-efficacy for surrogate decision making as 
well as intent to use  palliative care or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410676].  
 
African Americans are at high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_410677], thus, to  experience the negative 
impacts of ADRD caregiving. African Americans are twice as likely to  develop ADRD as compared 
to Whites.1,[ADDRESS_518000] caregivers may face significantly  more caregiver stress, physical, and 
psychological effects as compared to oth er caregivers.11–[ADDRESS_518001]. Alzheimer’s  
disease and related dementias are a set of serious, life limiting illnesses where both the person  
living with ADRD,  and their family  caregiver (s) can greatly benefit from palliative care. Yet, African  
Americans are less likely to have access to or receive palliative care than other racial/ethnic 
groups.   
 
Evidence -based caregiver support interventions  are lacking17 and therefore often do not meet the 
needs  of African American ADRD caregivers in a culturally sensitive manner.[ADDRESS_518002] caregivers. While support groups are shown to be 
beneficial, they  are often ridged with inflexible meeting times, locations, topi[INVESTIGATOR_33722], etc. 
Similar to the term  ‘dementia,’ ‘support groups’ may have negative connotations among African 
Americans.[ADDRESS_518003] caregiving 
differs  primarily because of the associated cognitive decline a nd behavioral symptoms.

  Version Date:  1-15-[ADDRESS_518004] and also improve 
caregiver quality of life.19 Lay (social) and 
professional (healthcare provider) support 
are important and integral to health  
promotion.20 Supportive social relationships 
include both embedded (i.e. family, friends, 
church  members, neighbors) and created 
social networks.19,20 These self -help support 
networks may be in  group form or one -to-one 
involvement as well as paraprofessional 
(involving extensive training  and professional 
involvement).[ADDRESS_518005] caregiving outcomes.  The 
Pair 2 Care model has potential for adaptation to meet the needs of caregivers of persons living  
with other diseases and/or racial/ethnic populations in the future. It is responsive to the National  
Alzheimer’s Plan22 and request for proposals from professional organizations such as the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410678] . 
This progress place s significant  focus on equity in palliative care.  
 
Preliminary Work.  Our prior work as well as that of others have shown that perceived  
understanding of end -of-life terminology in health -related decision -making matters and  that 
cultural  tailoring is critical to improving advance care planning approaches.16,23,[ADDRESS_518006] found that access to culturally -specific mechanisms is an  
unmet need to improve advance care planning and healthcare decision making engagement (see  
Figure 1). Factors  such as shared understanding, identity, and experiences through storytelling 
are consistent with embracing cultural affinity in the African American community.8 
 
Figure 1 depi[INVESTIGATOR_410679] ( FamCare ) Study  approach 
which included  perspectives from former  family caregivers, healthcare providers, and community  
leaders to identify the healthcare decision making  needs of those who are currently caregiving. 
This foundational work was guided by [CONTACT_410713] (2016),16 including the 

Study  Protocol # 2023B 71  Date of IRB Approval:  6-30-2023  
  Version Date:  1-15-2024          
 
 5 development  of interview guides. This model describes  personal, intrapersonal, and structural 
barriers to  advance care planning and healthcare decision  making and stresses the likelihood of 
informal  discussions instead of documented plans among African Americans.16 Cultural affinity is 
similar  to social identity, which is defined as one’s emotional closeness to and in -group 
identification to  a specific sub -culture.25,26 The family caregivers in our previous  FamCare study 
expressed a strong desire for  advanc e care planning and healthcare decision making to be more 
aligned with cultural affinity for  easier adoption, to match patients’ needs and wishes, and improve 
completion. In th is proposed  study , we will also leverage the desire of former family caregivers to 
‘give back’. We will, therefore,  use our existing participant cohort of former family caregivers for 
this proposed study . This approach promotes trust and continued engagement in research  for a 
group already at high risk for low research participation.  
 
Pair [ADDRESS_518007] Wi -Fi access. In the future , the Pair 2 Care framework can be 
implemented into existing programs such as African American Alzheimer’s and Wellness 
Association ( AAAWA ) and the Alzheimer’s Association and scaled for adaptation to other 
caregiver types and racial/ethnic groups ensures sustainability. Future p olicy development will 
ensure its inclusion in national caregiver programs.  
 
While there are no direct benefits to the individual study participants, the proposed study will be 
highly important in filling gaps in essential information that will lead to improved interventions and 
policy changes. It will provide feasibility and acceptability pi[INVESTIGATOR_410680].  
 
III. Procedures  
 
Overall Procedures  
 
All study  procedures will be approved by [CONTACT_293943]  (OSU)  Institutional  Review 
Board (IRB). Procedures will be conducted remotely allowing flexibility for participation. 
Intervention  development initially began using stakeholder data collected from our FamCare 
Study as previously described. A total of 15 people who are currently caring for a loved one 
(current caregivers) and total of 15 people who cared for a loved one who lived with dementia 
(former caregivers) will be enrolled in the Pair 2 Care research study . Mentors may be assigned 
an additional  mentee. Former caregivers (mentors) will complete up to two 1 -hour training 
sessions to become mentors to current caregivers (mentees). Former caregivers will be called 
mentors and current caregivers will be called mentees. Each mentor and mentee will be paired 
for [ADDRESS_518008] in common  as identified using the (see Participant Intake Form ). During 
the Pair 2 Care program/intervention , mentors will provide non -judgmental, flexible, culturally 
sensitive support to their mentees and share their personal caregiving experience s. This may 
include inform ation such as the following: accessing/selecting healthcare providers, attending 
doctor visits, attending worship services, coronavirus pandemic/endemic, exercise, faith, family 
dynamics, finances, healthcare decision making, mental health, nutrition, physical health, sleep, 
social ac tivities, spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824].  Data collected during the participant screening process such as family 
caregiver type, etc., may be used from consented individuals.  Once each week during the 6 
months connection, mentees will be sent a short survey (see Appendix for Weekly Mentee 
Interaction Assessment Response Form)  by [CONTACT_3649] , email, and/or phone call  to complete about their 
interaction with their mentor during the last week.  If not  completed  by [CONTACT_88117], a text email 
Study  Protocol # 2023B 71  Date of IRB Approval:  6-30-2023  
  Version Date:  1-15-2024          
 
 6 and/or phone call reminder will be sent within a  couple days after as a reminder to complete  it. A 
weekly text/email/reminder phone call message may be used to : 1) thank participants for being in 
the study, 2) remind mentees  and mentors  to connect , and or  3) remind mentees to complete 
their Weekly Mentee Interaction Assessment Response Form .  
 
A. Research Design  
 
Design . A community -based participatory approach will be used to further develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_410681] 2 Care.  The proposed intervention  was initially developed based on data provided by 
[CONTACT_410714] ’s (PI) completed studies (D ecision Making  
for African American with Dementia  Study  - DAADS  and FamCare Stud y).  
 
Community Advisory Board - FamCAB.  The Family Caregiver Community Research (FamCare) 
Lab Community Advisory Board Community Advisory Board ( FamCAB) has been formed . The 
FamCAB members and are not part of the research  and therefore are not research study 
participants . However , their engaged work is informing this and other research  within  the PI’s 
research program . As no n-research participants, the overall goal of the FamCAB is to assist in 
tailoring the Pair  [ADDRESS_518009] caregivers and for intervention sustainability over time. The 
purpose of the FamCAB will be to: 1) assist the study  team with accessing potential caregiver 
participants in the local community, 2) introduce study  staff to key community l eaders and 
members, 3) identify community assets (e.g., resources, organizations) to support the proposed 
study , 4) develop the protocol and ensure content validity by [CONTACT_410715]  2 Care 
study  protocol (including mentor  training and materials) prior to participant  enrollment, and 5) 
provide iterative feedback on  intervention  development before, during, and after pi[INVESTIGATOR_410682]. The FamCAB will advise  the research team 
on study  procedures (e.g. , discussion topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], frequency of interactions, etc.).  As the FamCAB will 
not access data or participant identifying information .

B. Sample and Setting  
 
A sample of n=15 current family caregivers (mentees) and 
n=15 former family caregivers (mentors)  who self -identify 
as being Black/ African American caregiver of an older adult 
living with or who lived with ADRD will be recruited to pi[INVESTIGATOR_410683] 2 Care program/intervention . For this short 
duration study, participants will be recruited from the 
Central Ohio area – Columbus area and surrounding 
communities.  As requested by [CONTACT_410716] -created intervention, this study is being 
conducted virtually. While recruitment may occur via phone, 
video call, email, or in -person using the IRB -approved study flier and recruitments scripts, 
consenting and data collection will be completed remotely. Therefore, participants (mentors and 
mentees) are not required to meet in -person for this study.  
 
C. Recruitment  
 
Potential participants will be recruited from the Central Ohio area – Columbus area and 
surrounding communities through research registries, community partnerships and events such 
as health fairs and at churches, snowball methods, and social media. For this remotely conducted 
study, all study -related materials will be organized online from the PI’s College of Nursing office 
or the remote work site of the research team members. Research team members may wo rk in-
person at The Ohio State University or remotely . If recruiting remotely (as with data collection), 
research team members will ensure that they are located in a private location and their computer 
is connected to the CON remo te access VPN to ensure security. Headsets will be used as needed 
to help  to ensure privacy of conversations. No participant information will be stored at research 
team members’ remote locations. All electronic study data will be stored on a secure OSU College 
of Nursing research server or in Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap)29. This includes 
demographic and other survey data as well as interview audio and transcripts. Each participant 
will be assigned a unique study identification alpha -numeric code. Only members of the study 
team will be able to link participants with stud y identification alpha -numeric code. Names, phone 
numbers, and mailing addresses will be stored separately from study alpha -numeric code 
numbers, verbal consent s, study data, and interview transcripts. Data collected as part of this 
study will be stored in an established data repository per The OSU Policy and Procedures. The 
participants will be able to choose the location they make phone, or video call or email f rom for 
interacting with study team members .

 8 The Recruitment Script (see appendix) will be used for phone, video  call, email, or in -person 
recruitment  along with the  study flier (see appendix) . Community -based organizations such as 
nursing homes, churches, and dementia -focused organizations may share study fliers with 
potential participants such as through email via listservs, posting on their organization social 
media sites, or posting study fliers within their organizations using the Community Partner 
Recruitment (via email , phone , video call, or in-person) along with the study flier. The FamCa re 
Lab Website will have a page dedicated to the Pair 2 Care Study that will include the study flier, 
Study Introduction Note, and the Study Welcome Video (see script in appendix). The  Study 
Welcome Video will also be placed on the lab website’s home page.  Potential participants or 
community partners may choose to share the study f lier with others in their contacts, and they 
may post the flier on their social media sites e.g., Facebook©, Twitter©, and Instagram©. 
Additionally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_410684], attend health fairs, such as at nursing homes or other community -based 
organizations that may include sharing the study flier and offering contin uing education credits as 
needed . These community presentations are educational presentations that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_410685]. These presentations are 
given regularly on topi[INVESTIGATOR_410686] -of-life care, family caregiving , and dementia, 
etc. as requested by [CONTACT_29436] -based organizations. Following such community engagements, 
the IRB -approved study flier  may be made available to attendees as with distribution at local 
health fairs. There will be no additional study informat ion included in the present ations . Snowball 
methods will also be used for recruitment of study  participants. Potential participants will contact 
[CONTACT_410717] -person, via phone call, or email  for additional study information, and 
eligibility screening. This convenience sampling approach will be augmented with snowball 
recruitment methods to identify additional potentially eligible caregiver study participants. 
Additionally , enrolled participants will also be asked if they know of anyone else who may qualify 
to participate in the study. If so, the participant will either pass along the study information and PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_410687] n and potential participant themselves will contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_410688]. Otherwise, if the participant agrees to reach out to other potential 
caregiver(s) to ask if it is okay to share their contact [CONTACT_3031] w ith the study team, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a 
member of the research team will contact [CONTACT_410718]  (see appendix) . 
 
Recruitment efforts will ensure that each current family caregiver  as mentee  will be paired with a 
former caregiver  mentor . Participants will also be recruited from FamCare Lab Participant 
Registry  and Website . We will b uild on established  research partnership with  current and former 
family caregivers who  previously participated , provided input and feedback , and indicat ed 
willingness to be included in future research  studies . From our FamCare Study, current and 
former caregiver s expressed their desire to be recontact[CONTACT_410719] . Therefore, they are willing to be recontact[CONTACT_228291] 
(using the S creening Form) and invited to participate in this Pair 2 Care  study . The following 
criteria will be used to determine family caregiver participant eligibility:  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  Current and former family caregivers will be included if they are: 1) at least 18 
years old, 2) self -identify as being African American/Black, 3) either currently provide or manage 
care for at least 8 hours  per week for an African American/Black older adult (60 years or older) 
family member or otherwise fictive kin living with ADRD or did so in the past (at last [ADDRESS_518011] 
care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_410689]). Former family caregivers will be assessed for readiness to be a m entor, 
including comfort discussing grief and loss. They must indicate that they have experience with 
palliative care and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249].   
Study  Protocol # 2023B 71  Date of IRB Approval:  6-30-2023  
  Version Date:  1-15-2024          
 
 9 Exclusion Criteria:  Current and former family caregivers will be excluded if they state that they: 1) 
do not have this experience, or 2) are uncomfortable discussing healthcare decisions, end -of-life 
decision making, grief, loss, death, and dying, particularly as it relates to the loss of their loved 
one who lived with ADRD.  
 
During screening potential participants will be asked if the y have access to a Wi -Fi-enabled smart 
phone  or table for use during the study. If they respond ‘No ’, the research team member will 
provide information for accessing a study -provided Wi-Fi-enabled tablet for study use.  
 
D. Screening  
 
The Caregiver Screening  Form will be used to determine if the caregiver meets study inclusion 
criteria. This form may be completed in -person, or via phone or video call. If study criteria are met 
and the family caregiver agrees to participate, they will be offered several potential dates and 
times for scheduling verbal consenting and data collection. In preparation  for the appointment , a 
copy of the Study Consent Information Document will be emailed or mailed  to potential participant 
in advance of consenting  for them to read in advance of consenting and to keep a copy for their 
records . This email will contain the Study Introduction Note and the Study Welcome Video  (see 
scripts in appendix) , and the Caregiver Study Information Document, Mental Health Resources 
Sheet, and Zoom© Instructions will be attached (see appendix). Data collected during the 
screening process such as family caregiver type may be included as study data from participants 
once consented .  
 
Participants will verbally agree to participate in the study.  Prior t o establishing  the peers, the 
Participant Intake Form (see appendix) will be completed to ensure the best matches  based on 
similar qualities . This form  will also include their preference s for receipt of email/text/phone call 
communication . 
 
E. Consenting  
 
All data from study participants will be collected following IRB approval of study procedures. Each 
study participant will provide a verbal informed consent prior to all data collection. Consent 
procedures will be conducted remotely allowing flexibility fo r participation. Potential caregivers will 
be emailed (using Caregiver Recruitment Script) the Caregiver Consent  Information Document , 
Mental Health Resources Sheet, Zoom© Instructions, along with a copy of the IRB-approved Study 
Flier ahead of the consenting appointment. A reminder text/phone call/email will be placed/sent 
at least 1 day prior to the appointment using the   Text Message or Email Scripts  – see appendix ). 
The research team member will meet with potential participant via phone or video call. The 
Caregiver Consent  Information  Document  will be read aloud by [CONTACT_253475],  or 
the participant may choose to read it for themselves  before providing  verbal consent . Time will be 
allowed for the participants to ask questions and responses will be provided. Once all information 
has been clarified, the research team member will ask the following questions and their responses 
documented in  REDCap29 by [CONTACT_253475]:  
 
In order to provide your verbal consent, can you please answer the following questions:  
 
1. “Do you agree to participate in the Pair 2 Care: Peer Support for Caregivers of African 
Americans Living with Dementia Study? YES or NO  
 
2. “Is it okay for me to record the audio during the interview?” YES or NO  
Study  Protocol # 2023B 71  Date of IRB Approval:  6-30-2023  
  Version Date:  1-15-2024          
 
 10  
3. “When the study is completed, would you like to receive a copy of the study results?” 
YES or NO  
 
4. “Would you like to be contact[CONTACT_410720]?” YES 
or NO  
 
A response of ‘Yes” must be provided for question #1 for the participant to be enrolled.  
 
Once the participant is enrolled in the study, they will be sent a welcome email/text containing the 
study introduction video developed using the  Study Introduction  Video Script  (see appendix) 
recorded by [CONTACT_978]. Alternatively, a brief welcome letter will be mailed (see appendix for Study 
Welcome Video/Note).   
 
Consent Addendum  
 
Mentors will be invited to complete an optional 1 -hour audio -recorded individual interview at the 
end of the study (Month 6  or 7) about their experience as a mentor in  the study. This interview will 
be audio recorded using two voice  recorders. During the interview, they will have the option to 
choose not  to answer any question that  they do not wish to answer . The interview will be 
completed  over the  telephone or video call.  Prior to the mentees completing the interview, 
mentors will be provided a copy of the consent addendu m (see appendix) via mail and/or email 
using the Consent Addendum Email Script (see appendix). The following questions will be 
asked to obtain verbal consent prior to completing the interview:  
 
1. “Do you agree to complete the optional mentor interview for the Pair 2 Care Study?” YES or  
NO 
 
2. “Is it okay for me to record the audio during the interview?” YES or NO  
 
A response of Yes” must be provided for question #1 in order for the interview to be completed.  
 
At the beginning of the study, we will ask caregivers to provide us their phone number so we can 
add it to our participant communication platform . During the study, we will use Twilio integrated 
into REDCap  to communicate with participants via text messaging. Participants will not pay any 
additional charges for this service over and above what they normally are charged by [CONTACT_410721]/r eceiving any data. 
Twilio is completely integrated  into the OSU version of REDCap and does not require use of a 
separate app to communicate with participants. All participant information will be kept within the 
REDCap platform. Participants are unable to respond to text messages sent via Twilio. Only 
trained study staff will be able to access the REDCap project.  
 
F. Mentor Training  
 
Prior to engaging with their current caregiver mentee, former caregivers will complete up to two 
1-hour virtual training sessions either individually or via group session(s) over Zoom© (see 
appendix for Mentor Training Slides). This training will include video -recorded communication 
scenarios using culturally congruent actors for four exemplar scenarios : Training video script #1 
- Support for Caregivers , training video script #2 – Near End -of-Life Scenario , training video script 
#3 - Happy Peer Connection , and t raining Video Script #4 – Long -term Care Decision Making  
Study  Protocol # 2023B 71  Date of IRB Approval:  6-30-2023  
  Version Date:  1-15-2024          
 
 11 (see appendix). A Black -owned media company  such as , SpencerHigherforMedia© will be  hired 
to review scripts and for talent acquisition to support cultural congruency. Manipulation checks 
will be conducted using verbal questions posed by [CONTACT_410722] (see Mentor  Training Manipulation Checks Survey). This will include “what if” scenarios 
to ensure understanding of content delivered. If responses reveal that former caregivers are not 
receiving the intervention as intended, we will immediately reassess, discuss with the FamCA B, 
and may schedule an additional training session, if needed. The additional one -on-one training 
sessions may be scheduled to review previously covered information with former family 
caregivers and answer any questions as needed. A brief 1 –2-page Mentor  Training Summary 
Sheet (see appendix) will be provided at the end of the training sessions  once the mentor is paired 
with their mentee . While former caregiver (mentee) training may be completed in group settings 
or individually, no surveys, questionnaires, or interviews, etc. will be collected on a group setting. 
Following the training, mentors will complete the Mentor Training Evaluation Form (see appendix) 
via text or email to provide feedback on the training session(s) Table 1 outlines former caregiver 
training activities.  Emails and or texts will be sent prior to mentor trainings using the Text Message 
or Email Script.  Once the mentor training is completed, a certificate of completion (see appendix) 
will be sent to each via mail and email  using the Mentor Training Certificate Email Script  (see 
appendix) . Mentors will be able to meet with a research team member as needed .

 12 Pairing of Mentors and Mentees:  Once mentor  training session (s) are completed , mentors and 
mentees  will be paired based on similar qualities such as caregiving relationship and gender 
identity based on information provided on the Caregiver Intake Form.  Mentors may be assigned 
an additional mentee. A virtual introduction of current and former caregiver pairs will be made by 
a study team member  using the Peer Introduction Meeting with Research Team Member  Agenda 
(see appendix) .  
 
Each pair will complete at least five virtual face -to-face (video) interactions and at least 10 other

 14 H. Participant Incentives/Compensation for Time  
 
Participants  will receive a $ 25 VISA© gift card and thank -you note (see Appendix - Text Message 
or Email Scripts ) each time a set of surveys, mentee  interview, mentor  training is completed. 
Current caregivers (mentees) will complete surveys in the beginning, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 -
month follow -up. The 1 -month follow -up will include an audio -recorded interview. Former 
caregivers (mentors) will complete surveys in the beginning, training, and 3 -months and 6 -
months. You will receive a total of $100 over the ti me of the study.  See Figure 3 for Honorarium 
Distribution Plan.  Data collection points will be tracked by [CONTACT_410726] a 
data collection log. Gift cards will be delivered electronically via email or via mail (depending on 
their preference) using Virtual Incentives,©  an OSU -reviewed portal. Participants will receive an 
email from Virtual Incentives© to select their preferred delivery method (electronic or mail). See 
appendix for sample view of Virtual Incentives© Reward Center Landing Page (see appendix) that 
includes  a thank -you note  (see appendix). Virtual Incentives© will be provided with participants 
name, mailing address, phon e and/or email address. Virtual Incentives© will not share 
participants’ information with others. This service is at no cost to the study participants . A security 
and privacy review was conducted by [CONTACT_410727] s. There will be no communications with study participants  that are not 
study related and all participant identifiers will be destroyed after study completion. At the end of 
the study completion, each participant will be mailed a hand -written  thank -you note  in gratitude 
for their study participation .

I. Study Risks    
 
Though this study poses minimal risks to participants, steps will be taken to ensure that participant 
risk remains minimal. As peer mentors are not health or healthcare experts, therefore, mentees  
will be reminded to seek advice from health experts for all health and safety issues (see Health 
Safety Protocol in appendix). This includes accessing [ADDRESS_518017] their mentor or mentee after four (4) attempts, they will be encouraged 
to cease and notify a study team member who will attempt to connect with the mentor or mentee. 
Participants  with knowledge or concerns about health or safety issues will immediately report 
them to a study  team member, who will report it to the study  leader. The study leader is a 

Study  Protocol # 2023B 71  Date of IRB Approval:  6-30-2023  
  Version Date:  1-15-[ADDRESS_518018] information will be provided  directly to 
participants for health concerns. If found to be an unsafe environment, at the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], an 
event report will be made to make the decision to exit the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_410701] a 
participant to exit th e study . 
 
Discussions  about death and dying may evoke feelings of related sadness related. Participants 
will be reminded that they can choose to end the interview at any time by [CONTACT_410728]. They will also be re minded that they 
can refuse to respond to a  survey or  interview question at any time if they are not comfortable or 
simply do not wish to respond simply by [CONTACT_410729].  
Participants can also decide to drop out o f the study at any time without penalization  by [CONTACT_410730] . If a participant exits the study for any reason, their mentor/mentee may be 
allowed to continue participating if they choose to do so. The research team will thoroughly 
document the discontinuation of peer relationship, the remaining peer  may be given the option to 
remain in the study , and their data analyzed to reflect this change in their engagement in the 
study. Their data may be analyzed separately from peers  that complete the full study. Also, i f the 
mentor -mentee relationship is not deemed a good match, attempts will be made by [CONTACT_17881], in collaboration with the PI , to address any concerns. It will be at the PI [INVESTIGATOR_410702]. If so, the p eer 
participation in the study will end. The Study Exit Script will be used to convey,  and study exit 
information. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_410703](s) to remain in the study or not. Drs. Moss (PI) as a trained as registered nurse will 
be able to identify acute physical and/or psychological needs of the participants observed or 
reported and be able to make appropriate and timely referrals. If caregivers are thought to be 
experiencing a ny acute psychological or physical distress, they will be asked to visit their 
respective primary healthcare provider a s well as offered access to community -based mental 
health resources or [ADDRESS_518019] the research tea m if any issues arise regarding the interaction/relationship 
with their p eer. Any  such challenge will be address with participants by [CONTACT_978], if a solution is not 
possible or if the participant(s) choose, they will be allowed to exit the study  (see appendix for 
Study  Exit Script and Early  Exit Form) . If a caregiver chooses to leave the study or are asked to 
leave the study at any time for any reason, they will be asked not to be in contact [CONTACT_410731] -related activities.   
 
All electronic study data will be stored on a secure OSU College of Nursing research server. This 
includes recordings of demographic data, questionnaires, and interview transcripts. Each 
participant will be assigned a unique study identification alpha -nume ric code. Only members of 
the study team will be able to link participants with study identification alpha -numeric code. 
Names, phone numbers, and mailing addresses will be stored separately from study alpha -
numeric code numbers, recordings of verbal conse nts, study data, and interview transcripts. Data 
collected as part of this study will be stored in an established data repository per The OSU  Policy 
and Procedures.   
 
Contracted platforms such as Virtual Incentives© (secure gift card  distribution service) maybe 
provided participants ’ name s, mailing address, phone and/or email address . Study participants 
will be made aware of this during the consenting process. As part of their OSU security user 
agreements all external services used (Virtual Incentives, Rev, and Dedoose) will not share any 
participant information and they will delete this information at the end of the study. Interview

 16 transcripts will be de -identified and no individual participant identifiers will be used in 
presentations of study results and publications . 
 
The OSU Information Technology (IT) Department will provide web-based resources  such as 
instruction s for connecting to Zoom©, and support to address other technological challenges such 
as Wi-Fi connectivity. For participants who do not have a Wi-Fi-enabled device or Wi -Fi access, 
a Wi-Fi enabled device such as a tablet and or Wi -Fi connectivity will be provided  to them for the 
time required for their study participation. If needed, participants will be put in touch with a College 
of Nursing IT specialist ([CONTACT_410739]  or another representative) for any technical assistance 
that is needed. The OSU Center for Clinical and Translational Research Community Connectors 
Program will assist with social media recruitm ent and REDCap29 setup for data collection. 
Partnership will continue with the local AAAWA and Alzheimer’s Association for recruitment and 
future intervention  implementation. Available community -based financial assistance for reduced 
Wi-Fi cost will be recommended for caregivers who request Wi -Fi access. Pair  2 Care framework 
implemented into existing programs such as AAAWA and scaled for adaptation to other caregiver 
types and racial/ethnic groups ensures sustainability. Policy development ensures inclusion in 
local, state, and national caregiver programs.  Additional p otential barriers and solutions are 
proposed in Table 5.

J. Internal Validity  
 
Threats to internal and external validity exist. For example,  the study team will not be able to 
control additional external support that the current caregiver is receiving simultaneously that may 
impact study findings. The team will also not be able to control if the relationship between the 
peers  is not conducive to p eer support. However, participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_410732] . In the conduct of pre - and post - tests are strategically 
timed based on prior studies with a goal to help avoid any desire of the participants to remain 
consistent in  their responses. Data collection forms will be completed via telephone or video call 
(via Zoom©) with a research team member for consistency and to avoid missing data. Study 
participants may have participated in the prior FamCare Study. This relationship over the time 
with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_410705]. However, the benefits of their 
continued partici pation in this co -created community -based study outweighs this threat and will 
be acknowledged in the study results. Over the course of the study, participants my drop out. To 
mitigate this, the research team will maintain constant connection with them through frequent 
check -ins via phone call, text messages, and email for check -ins and data collection as outlined.  
Study  Protocol # 2023B 71  Date of IRB Approval:  6-30-2023  
  Version Date:  1-15-[ADDRESS_518020] three independent 
coders to help to ensure validation of conclusions. Member checking with up to two participants 
in each category ( current and former  caregivers ) will be conducted to verify if understanding of 
data rang true to them. Study team i nterview training will help to ensure regularity in the delivery 
process. All interviewers will also be trained in interview data collection procedures for 
consistency in this process to reduce variabil ity of findings as a result. Data will be reported with 
sufficient descriptive data with the intent to ensure that data transferability is possible to applicable 
settings or groups.  
 
For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], that is thus not fully powered, data obtained regarding feasibility and 
acceptability of the intervention will not be generalizable to the larger population. Therefore, data 
obtained will be used to inform the next step study to test effectiveness of the intervention.  
 
K. Data Analysis  
 
Descriptive statistics will be conducted on all participant demographic data using SPSS or similar 
software.  
Aim 1: Feasibility and  acceptability of the Pair  2 Care Intervention  in current ( n=15) and trained 
former ( n=15) African  American ADRD family caregivers will be determined by [CONTACT_410733], recruitment,  and retention data ( e.g., consent, drop out, refusal rates), protocol 
adherence, satisfaction, and  appropriateness of the intervention  for broader dissemination. We 
will conduct descriptive statistics  for this Aim using proportion for categorical measures 
(recruitment, retention, and protocol  adherence) and mean±standard deviation for continuous 
measures (80% satisfaction and 80%  appropriateness). Interviews will be  conducted with current 
caregivers to gather in -depth data on  their Pair  [ADDRESS_518021] 
caregivers. Interviews will be analyzed as described below.  Aim 2: Descriptive statistics will be 
used to summarize sample characteristics and outcome  measures (anxiety, depression, quality 
of life, social support, self -efficacy for surrogate decision  making, and intent to use palliative 
care/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249]) at each time point. For each outcome,  we will use mixed -effects linear 
modeling for repeated measures to model the outcome as a linear  function of fixed -effect of time. 
The model will also include subject -specific random intercepts to  adjust for within -subject 
clustering from repeated measures. We hypothesize that at 6 months as  compared to baseline, 
current caregivers will report less anxiety and depression, higher quality of  life, higher social 
support, higher self -efficacy for surr ogate decision making, and higher intent to  use palliative 
care/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249]. From the mixed -effects modeling, we will test this  hypothesize by [CONTACT_410734] 6 months.  
Power analysis suggested that our sample size ( n=15) will have only 38% power to detect a  
medium effect size of Cohen’s d = 0.[ADDRESS_518022]  
size is equivalent to a clinical meaningful difference. Therefore, we will not rely on statistical  
significance. Instead, results interpretation will be guide by [CONTACT_9310], precision of the  
estimates (e.g., 95% confidence interval), effect sizes, and their clinical significance.  
 
Qualitative Data Analysis:  Caregiver interview recordings will be  transcribed, verified for accuracy, 
and combined with field notes for analysis. Data analyses will  be ongoing and iterative to inform 
additional probes and analyses. Content analysis will be  completed via Dedoose software©,39 
using qualitative descriptive methods to describe themes that  emerge. Independent coding will 
be done by [CONTACT_410735].40,41 Coders will  discuss and reconcile coding 
Study  Protocol # 2023B 71  Date of IRB Approval:  6-30-2023  
  Version Date:  1-15-[ADDRESS_518023] processing and paper and pencil methods. 
Dedoose39 software supports analysis of implicit “deeper” themes that are not necessarily 
explicitly identified by [CONTACT_410736]. Independent coding will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_410737]. The coders will meet 
to discuss and reconcile coding to 100% agreement. Member checking with up to two participants 
in each category (family caregivers, healthcare providers, and community stakeholders ) will be 
conducted to verify if understanding of data rang true to them.11 Qualitative and quantitative data 
will be initially analyzed separately then brought together brought together for side -by-side 
comparisons. Both types of data will be compared and related to provide further explanation 
of study findings. A plain language summary of the results of the research (prepared at a 4th 
grade reading level) . Study findings will be disseminated via scholarly conference paper and 
poster presentations as well as local community -based newsletters to ensure a vast and va ried 
readership.

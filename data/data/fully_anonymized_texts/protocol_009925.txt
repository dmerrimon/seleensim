1. Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
Investigating if giving post-operative dexamethasone to patients with a history of opi[INVESTIGATOR_22377].
2. Probable Duration of Project: State the expected duration of the project, including all follow-up and 
data analysis activities.  
5-5.5 years of data collection followed by [CONTACT_22441]
3. Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide 
references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
In August 2018, the CDC published data from 1999 – 2014 showing that the US national 
prevalence rate of deliveries of women with opi[INVESTIGATOR_22378] 1.5 to 6.5 per 
1,000 deliveries.1 Another recent study reported that 20-40% of pregnant women filled a 
prescription for opi[INVESTIGATOR_22379]2, which does not account for opi[INVESTIGATOR_22380]. Thus, rates are even higher if illegally obtained prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_22381]. 
These are only a couple examples of data that have brought more attention to the effect of the 
national opi[INVESTIGATOR_22382].
Complications are still incurred even if women are able to manage their opi[INVESTIGATOR_22383], which carries with it risks of repeated cycles of withdrawal, contraction of infectious 
diseases, and even overdose and death.3 For example, there were 211 maternal deaths in Colorado 
from 2004–2013 and 63 of them were by [CONTACT_6270]-harm (accidental overdose or suicide). Most of these 
deaths occurred during the postpartum period and involved OUD (majorly opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related).4 
Additionally, another recent study discusses how overdose is the leading cause of maternal 
associated deaths in Utah from 2004-2013, (69 of 113) with opi[INVESTIGATOR_22384].[ADDRESS_21569] for use in pregnant women with opi[INVESTIGATOR_22385] (MAT), as its use is associated with improvement in 
fetal and obstetric outcomes, including compliance with prenatal care, lower rates of preterm birth, 
reduced fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, and a higher likelihood of newborn being 
discharged to his/her parents.6
Medication assisted treatment includes regular (at least once a day) use of methadone, 
buprenorphine or suboxone. As a review: methadone is a synthetic opi[INVESTIGATOR_22386]’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328].  It 
occupi[INVESTIGATOR_22387], 
morphine, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_22388]. In an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent person, treatment doses do not 
produce euphoria. It is unique amongst MAT options in that it must be given daily by a methadone 
clinic. Buprenorphine is a partial opi[INVESTIGATOR_2641], meaning that it binds to opi[INVESTIGATOR_22389]. It also reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms in

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/12/2022a person with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_22390]. This medication can be prescribed 
by a physician who is specially certified. Suboxone is a partial opi[INVESTIGATOR_22391] (naloxone), which was developed to further prevent medication misuse. It can also be 
prescribed by [CONTACT_22442]. 
It is well established that patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_22392], as 
chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_22393]. Thus for our pregnant 
patients who undergo cesarean delivery, traditional postpartum pain strategies that include 
systemic or neuraxial opi[INVESTIGATOR_22394], and these women require a significantly larger 
amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_22395]-partum. Specifically, studies have showed that MAT maintained women 
have similar analgesic needs and response during labor, but require larger amounts of opi[INVESTIGATOR_22396]: 70% more in women maintained on methadone7 and 50% more for women on 
Buprenorphine.8 Further, undertreating pain is associated with worse maternal outcomes upon 
discharge including: persistent chronic pain, greater opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], delayed functional recovery, and 
increased postpartum depression, which are all factors associated with higher rates of relapse which 
can lead to overdose and death. [ADDRESS_21570] interested in an option that would be able to be administered 
consistently (same time/same way), that our own labor nurses could give, and without requiring the 
patient to have had an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892]. Further, Gabapentin, clonidine and ketamine are 
associated with CNS effects like sedation or confusion that could make health care providers less 
likely to be comfortable giving these women additional necessary narcotics due to possible 
worsened sedation or respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. Lastly, we wanted to give a drug that both 
obstetricians and pediatricians were comfortable with from extensive use in our maternal 
population. Thus, single administration IV dexamethasone was chosen for this study. 
Dexamethasone has been used as an adjunct for post-operative pain management in many types of 
surgeries. Although no large randomized trials exist, several small trials suggest an analgesic and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_22397]-operatively for both pregnant and non-pregnant 
patients; however these studies excluded patients on MAT.11-17

As there have been no studies on improving post-operative pain in this population (those with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_22404]), we will perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22405] a double 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/12/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/12/2022blind, placebo controlled randomized control trial using [ADDRESS_21571] shown an 
improvement in pain control postoperatively in the non-pregnant and/or non-MAT using population, we 
will use an online randomization tool to assign subjects to one of two groups in which subjects will 
receive a single administration of either 0.1 mg/kg of intravenous dexamethasone in 90mL of normal 
saline (experimental group) vs. 100mL of normal saline (placebo group) immediately upon the subjects’ 
arrival to the PACU (post anesthesia care unit) after leaving the operating room from their scheduled or 
non-urgent c-section. We will then measure improvement in pain control by [CONTACT_22444][INVESTIGATOR_22406]-partum 
prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We will look at patients’ pain scores, as routinely collected by [CONTACT_22445]-partum nurses to determine necessary pain medication administration, and quantity of narcotic 
use (morphine equivalents) at 1-hour, hours, 12-hours, 24-hours, 48-hours, and 72-hours post 
operatively. 
The dose chosen for our study (0.1mg/kg) was based on multiple other clinical trials for which this study 
designed was based on, including either pregnant patients undergoing c-sections or non-pregnant 
patients undergoing non-obstetric surgeries who were given perioperative dexamethasone. The 
following doses were used (eight referenced studies):
Doses given for C-section studies: 8mg, 10mg, 16mg
Doses given for non-c section operative studies: 0.1mg/kg in 3 studies (one with max up to 
8mg), 16mg, 8mg
Our study will use weight-based dosing. This will help to prevent subjects from getting doses that are 
higher than the above listed studies for their body mass.
Participants will be asked at the time of consent if they agree to being contact[CONTACT_6811] 6 months and 12 
months postpartum via phone call. The purpose of this phone call will be to follow up on continuation of 
their medication assistance therapy and inquire about any non-prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_22407]. 
The purpose of this will be to assess if the adjuvant pain therapy of dexamethasone resulted in less 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_22408]. We know from work by [CONTACT_22446] 1/[ADDRESS_21572] the option to consent to the 
study alone but not the follow up portion.

10. Risks: Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research. 
Risks with single administration dexamethasone are most relevant for special populations that have 
been excluded from this study, including:
Cardiovascular disease: Heart failure and/or hypertension; use has been associated with fluid retention, 
electrolyte disturbances, and hypertension. Use with caution following acute MI; corticosteroids have 
been associated with myocardial rupture.
Diabetes: may alter glucose production/regulation leading to hyperglycemia.
Gastrointestinal disease: (diverticulitis, recent intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, 
ulcerative colitis, abscess or other pyogenic infection) due to perforation risk
In regard to subjects who plan to breastfeed following delivery:
- Although the risk to newborns is unknown for any corticosteroid, use of dexamethasone is 
encouraged by [CONTACT_22448] (the ObGyn national body), and considered safe in pregnancy, especially 
for short term use. It is routinely given to mothers for fetal benefits, mainly lung maturity for 
suspected pre-term deliveries/neonates (ACOG Committee Opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] 713: Antenatal 
Corticosteroids for Fetal Maturity)
- When administered to lactating women, small amounts of corticosteroids entered human milk. 
Although data on the use of dexamethasone during lactation are not available, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics classified the corticosteroids prednisone and prednisolone as compatible 
with breastfeeding(Katz FH and Duncan BR: Entry of prednisone into human milk. N Engl J Med 
293:1154, 1975. McKenzie SA et al.: Secretion of prednisone into breast milk. Arch Dis Child 
50:894-6, 1975. Ost L et al.: Prednisolone excretion in human milk. J Pediatr 106:1008-11, 1985. 
Committee on Drugs, American Academy of Pediatrics. The transfer of drugs and other 
chemicals into human breast milk. Pediatrics 108:776-89, 2001.).
- If you plan to breastfeed your baby, this drug does appear in small quantities in breast milk and 
thus there is theoretical risk of use of corticosteroids have the potential to cause adverse events 
in a breastfeeding infant (eg, growth suppression, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid 
production) with chronic use, although information related to prolonged use is not 
available. Single doses of dexamethasone are considered compatible with breastfeeding; (WHO 
2002). 
- No data are available on the transfer of dexamethasone into human milk. It is likely similar to 
that of prednisone which is extremely low. Doses of prednisone as high as 120 mg fail to 
produce clinically relevant milk levels (equivalent of 18mg Dexamethasone). This product is 
commonly used in pediatrics for treating immune syndromes such as arthritis and, particularly, 
acute onset asthma or other bronchoconstrictive diseases. It is not likely that the amount in milk 
would produce clinical effect unless used in high doses over prolonged periods(Hale, Thomas 
W., and Hilary E. Rowe. Medications and Mothers' Milk 2017. Springer Publishing Company, 
2016.).

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/12/2022- The half-life is [ADDRESS_21573] 
milk after one day.
- Breastfeeding while on corticosteroids carries minimal risk of exposure to the infant, which 
may be further decreased by [CONTACT_22449] 4 hours after the dose 
(Makol, Ashima, Kerry Wright, and Shreyasee Amin. "Rheumatoid Arthritis and 
Pregnancy." Drugs 71.15 (2011): 1973-[ADDRESS_21574] L, Wettrell G, Bjorkhem I, et al. Prednisolone 
excretion in human milk. J Pediatr 1985 Jun; 106(6): 1008–11.).

3. Given the now established safety and validity of the current _________ in our prior work, we do 
not view the proposed studies as high risk.
4. Given our experience with the combined co-administration_________, we do not view the 
proposed studies as high risk.
Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential exists 
for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not 
possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-hand 
experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and 
safety of the proposed study as follows:
3. Attribution of Adverse Events:
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/12/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/12/2022Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures / design by [CONTACT_458], Victoria Wesevich and Audrey Merriam, according to 
the following categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate adverse event
3. Severe 
5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse Events:
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22414] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it results in any of 
the following outcomes:
1. Death;
2. A life-threatening experience in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]; 
3. A persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
4. A congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR
5. Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition. 
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  
Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE.  It is 
important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” when determining 
whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.
6. Plan for reporting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865] (including Adverse Events) to the IRB
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22416]: 
Any incident, experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria:
1. Is unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved protocol 
and informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied; AND 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/12/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 12/12/[ZIP_CODE]. Is related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_3459]); AND
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or non-
medical in nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related adverse 
events and unanticipated adverse device effects.  Please note that adverse events are reportable to 
the IRB as UPI[INVESTIGATOR_22417] 3 criteria listed above.
These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the appropriate 
forms found on the website. All related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt reporting 
requirements described in IRB Policy [ADDRESS_21575] to oversight by a DSMB (or other monitoring entity that is monitoring the study on behalf of an 
industry sponsor).
7. Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the protocol’s 
research monitor(s), e.g., industrial sponsor, Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC), Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study sponsors, funding and 
regulatory agencies, and regulatory and decision-making bodies.
For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory agencies will be notified 
(choose those that apply):
□ All Co-Investigators listed on the protocol.
□ Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)
□ Study Sponsor
The principal investigator, Victoria Wesevich and advisor Audrey Merriam, will conduct a review of all 
adverse events upon completion of every study subject. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22418].
Please note: For any study that may be considered high risk, the IRB will be more focused on the safety 
requirements for the study and a DSMB will likely be required. 
Minimal risk for infants and subjects receiving placebo
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22419], assuring protocol compliance, and 
conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency [monthly].  During the review process the

Board (IRB) or Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) have the authority 
to stop or suspend the study or require modifications.
This protocol presents minimal risks to the subjects (receiving placebo and infants of all subjects) 
and Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]), including adverse 
events, are not anticipated. In the unlikely event that such events occur, Reportable Events (which 
are events that are serious or life-threatening and unanticipated (or anticipated but occurring with a 
greater frequency than expected) and possibly, probably, or definitely related) or Unanticipated 
Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others that may require a temporary or permanent 
interruption of study activities will be reported immediately (if possible), followed by a written 
report within 5 calendar days of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_20866] 
(using the appropriate forms from the website) and any appropriate funding and regulatory 
agencies. The investigator will apprise fellow investigators and study personnel of all UPI[INVESTIGATOR_22421]. The protocol’s research monitor: Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC), will be informed of adverse maternal events within 5 days of the 
event becoming known to the principal investigator.

and those who received placebo using Student’s t-test. Comparison of total morphine dose equivalents 
used by [CONTACT_22451] a secondary outcome.  The total morphine 
dose equivalents will be calculated from the total narcotic dose and appropriate conversion (i.e. dilaudid 
dose to morphine dose equivalents).  This will be calculated as a total daily dose for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22423]/d over the entire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. These [ADDRESS_21577]-op. Calculating an average dose/d over 
the entire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22424]. This 
outcome will also be assessed using Student’s t-test. Data will be assessed for normality prior to running 
the t-test in the primary and secondary outcomes and if there is not a normal distribution Wilcoxon 
Rank sum test. Demographic and baseline data will be analyzed using two sample t –test for continuous 
data and χ2 for categorical data to determine whether there are any differences between groups. All 
statistical tests will be two-tailed with the alpha level set at 0.05.

Dexamethasone is a well-known and widely used long acting corticosteroid that is a strong anti-
inflammatory agent. It has been used as an adjunct for post-operative pain management as well as 
improvement in perioperative nausea and vomiting in many types of surgeries. It decreases 
inflammation by [CONTACT_22452], decreased production of inflammatory mediators, 
and reversal of increased capi[INVESTIGATOR_22425]; suppresses normal immune response. Dexamethasone's 
mechanism of antiemetic activity is unknown.
The majority of known risks with use of dexamethasone are associated with prolonged and/or 
high dose administration, especially in patients with specific medical co-morbidities, where as there are 
minimal risks with the single administration as we plan to utilize in our study in patients without the 
previously discussed co-morbidities. For example, an adverse reaction possible with our proposed 
dosing administration includes hyperglycemia, especially in those patients with uncontrolled diabetes.

pre-operative, prenatal visit. They will not be contact[CONTACT_22456]. On 
rare occasion, if a patient is failed to be identified or approached at this prenatal visit, the patient 
may be approached regarding participation in this study at the time of their pre-operative 
laboratory draw (at YNHH) the day prior to surgery or upon admission for their scheduled cesarean 
section.  
Given that unscheduled cesarean sections may occur overnight when the primary investigators are 
not at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], phone consent will be approached in these situations following the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria as described above. Additionally, these subjects will have been provided 
information about the study on their admission. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_22457]. The investigator 
that was contact[CONTACT_22458]’s chart for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, 
using mobile heartbeat phones the patient will be contact[CONTACT_22459]. A member of the primary care team will be present to confirm the 
patient is correctly identified as the study is explained in more detail than the information they were 
previously provided. The patient will be given opportunity to ask questions and then the consent will 
be signed by [CONTACT_22460] a member of the primary team and the investigator will sign the 
consent within 24 hours. 
Patients who require a cesarean delivery after a trial of labor will also be eligible for enrollment if 
the reason for cesarean delivery is non-urgent (see inclusion and exclusion criteria as described 
above). In these cases, the patient will have received information about the study and the consent 
form upon admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].The primary team will contact [CONTACT_22461] a conversation over the phone with the 
patient asking if they have any final questions and if they consent to participation. . The phone 
consent will occur as described above. Patients in these circumstances have adequate time to 
consider the study and consent if desired as their case is non-emergent and they received 
information about the study and the consent form on admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Subjects who do 
not receive information on the study and the consent form on admission will not be approached. 
c. Who is recruiting potential subjects? 
Research team members, including providers with obstetrical privileges at YNHH.

6.Process of Consent/Assent: Describe the setting and conditions under which consent/assent will be 
obtained, including parental permission or surrogate permission and the steps taken to ensure 
subjects’ independent decision-making. 
Subjects’ consent for participation in this study will be addressed in-person at the time of their 
routine pre-operative, prenatal visit. They will not be contact[CONTACT_22462]. On rare occasion, if a patient is failed to be consented at this prenatal visit, the 
patient may complete their consent process for participation in this study at the time of their pre-
operative laboratory draw (at YNHH) the day prior to surgery or upon admission for their scheduled 
cesarean section.
Given that unscheduled cesarean sections may occur overnight when the primary investigators are 
not at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], phone consent will be approached in these situations following the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria as described above. Additionally, these subjects will have been provided 
information about the study on their admission. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_22457]. The investigator

using mobile heartbeat phones the patient will be contact[CONTACT_22463]. 
Patients who require a cesarean delivery after a trial of labor will also be eligible for enrollment if 
the reason for cesarean delivery is non-urgent (see inclusion and exclusion criteria as described 
above). In these cases, the patient will have received information about the study and the consent 
form upon admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The primary team will contact [CONTACT_22464] a conversation over the phone with

not receive information on the study and the consent form on admission will not be approached. 
Participants will have the option to consent to the entire study, the randomized drug administration 
and follow up, or just the randomized study drug administration without follow up.
7.Evaluation of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the personnel 
obtaining consent will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent to the research 
being proposed. 
These subjects will be consented at the time they are consented for their scheduled cesarean 
section. Thus, if the obstetrical provider deems the patient can provide informed consent for their 
cesarean delivery, that provider will also assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to 
consent to participation in the research participation in a similar manor. 
Additionally, for unscheduled cesarean sections may occur overnight when the primary investigators 
are not at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], phone consent will be approached in these situations following the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria as described above. Additionally, these subjects will have been provided 
information about the study on their admission. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_22457]. The investigator 
that was contact[CONTACT_22458]’s chart for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, 
using mobile heartbeat phones the patient will be contact[CONTACT_22465]. 
Patients who require a cesarean delivery after a trial of labor will also be eligible for enrollment if 
the reason for cesarean delivery is non-urgent (see above inclusion and exclusion criteria) The 
phone consent will occur as described above. Patients in these circumstances have adequate time to 
consider the study and consent if desired as their case is non-urgent and they will have received 
information about the study and the study consent on admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Subjects who do 
not receive information on the study and the study consent on admission will not be approached. 
8.Non-English Speaking Subjects: Explain provisions in place to ensure comprehension for research 
involving non-English speaking subjects. If enrollment of these subjects is anticipated, translated 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_22431]. 
Non-English speaking subjects will be excluded from the study.

SECTION V: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the research, 
either to the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a benefit in this 
context of the risk benefit assessment.) 
Subjects of this study may receive the benefit of improved pain and require a smaller amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_22432] a result of participation in this study. It is possible 
that this improvement in pain and decrease in opi[INVESTIGATOR_22433] a history of

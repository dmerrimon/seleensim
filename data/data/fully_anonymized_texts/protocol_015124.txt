9/3/[ADDRESS_1246050] non -communicable diseases  (NCD)  (1,2). Blueberries are  a rich  
source of polyphenols , particularly , anthocyanins (ACNs)  (3).  Their  consumption has been 
linked with  improved  glucose levels in individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes (4), decrease d 
blood press ure and arterial stiffness in women with hypertension , and  decreased pain and 
disability in children with autoimmune arthritis (5). In addition,  animal and in vitro studies  
from the Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Center (ACNC)  have shown that  [ADDRESS_1246051]  cell senescence (6).   
However, t he mechanism by [CONTACT_889967] s  cannot be explained by [CONTACT_889968]  (7).  In the past decade, studies have shown  that dietary polyphenols undergo 
extensive metabolism by [CONTACT_889969] , giving origin  to bioactive  
derivatives  that potentially mediate health benefits  (8).  To our knowledge, no study has 
characterized polyphenol  derivative  profiles in blood and urine in children  after wild 
blueber ry supplementation.  
LFV is now considered among the top 10 risk factors for the development of NCDs 
and overall mortality (9). Alarmingly, in the [LOCATION_003] only 40% and 7% of children meet the U.S. 
Depar tment of Agriculture Food Patterns fruit and vegetable intake recommendation, 
respectively (10). It is not known if a polyphenol rich intervention with wild blueberry can 
improve markers of immune, cardiovascular and bone health in children with low fruit and 
vegetable consumption (LFV ). Data from ACNC suggest that fitness (peak VO2) modifies the 
association between fruit  and vegetable (FV) consumption and vascular health  of children. 
Specifically, children  with combined low FV intake and low peak VO2 have higher blood 
pressure values t han children with low fitness but higher FV consumption. These results 
suggest, that children with low fitness would not only benefit from more exercise but also 
from a higher FV content in their diets.  However, higher quality evidence is needed to inform  
clinical practice and dietary guidelines.

Objectives  
1) Characterize plasma and urine profile of polyphenol -derived metabolites of school -
age children supplemented short -term with wild blueberry powder.  
2)  Assess the effects of short -term  wild blueberry supplementation on immune 
responses as well as on markers  of bone  metabolism  and cardiovascular health in 
apparently healthy children who consume ≤2 cups of  fruits and vegetables  per day .  
3) Evaluate if cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (peak VO2) modifies the association between 
blueberry derived polyphenol consumption and markers of cardiovascular health . 
 
Study Design  and Procedures   
This is a double -blind randomized control trial 
aiming to characterize the profile of polyphenol -
derived metabolites in plasma and urine of 
children ages 11 to 12  years supplemented 
short -term with wild blueberry powder. Further, 
the study will assess if a short -term 
supplementa tion  (up to 6 days)  with wild 
blueberry powder impacts immune responses as 
well as markers of cardiovascular and bone 
health  while assessing for the effect modification 
of peak VO2 . Up to 44 children (boys and girls) 
will be recruited to participate. After  telephone 
screening, the children and parents will come to 
ACNC  for assenting/consenting  and initial measurements. After this, children and parents 
will attend  to 2  more study visits  at ACNC (total of 3 study visits). A description of study 
procedures follow below . Children will be asked to stop taking any kind of nutritional 
supplement (e.g., multivitamins, vitamin D, fish oil, probiotics, prebiotics, immune boosters, 
and others) at least [ADDRESS_1246052] ion that 
required antibiotics will be scheduled after 2 months of finalizing antibiotic treatment.

9/3/2021  Children with a viral infection such as diarrhea, cold or flu will be scheduled after 2 weeks of 
resolution of symptoms . 
Study visit (s) and assessments :  Three (3)  study visits will be conducted at ACNC  after an 
overnight fast .  All assessments may be repeated if/when needed, and if the participant is 
willing.  Following phone screening, qualifying participants will attend ACNC for further 
assessment of eligibility, informed consent and assent. Visit #[ADDRESS_1246053] up to 4  hours, visit 
#2 up to 4 hours, and visit #3 up to 8 hours.  Visit #[ADDRESS_1246054] if the par ticipant has 
adhered to a low -polyphenol diet 2 days prior to the study visit. Adherence will be 
determined by [CONTACT_889970] #1. 
If participants have not been compliant, they will be given the o ption to re -schedule visit #2 
upon  completion of 2 days on a low -polyphenol content diet.  The ACNC is a Well -Child 
facility separated from the ACH facilities with a separate entrance and is not used for clinical 
care which will limit exposures of the part icipants to illnesses.  Parents will be instructed not 
to come to the study visit if they or their child is ill.  The study visit will be rescheduled if that 
is the case to a time when both parent and child are well and asymptomatic.   
Study measurements  and procedures  
Dietary Intervention  
 Low polyphenol  Study  
Diet: Participants will be 
asked to adhere to a low 
polyphenol diet  (i.e., less 
than ≤0.5cups  of fruit an d 
≤0.5 cups  of vegetables per 
day, and avoid ing cocoa 
products, nuts, sweet 
potato, whole gra ins, 
caffeinated drinks , tea, and 
others ).  All participants will be instructed to follow a low polyphenol diet (a sample meal 
plan will be provided) .  Participants  will start the low polyphenol diet 2 days  prior to visit 
#2 up until  the day prior to visit #3 (total of 7 consecutive days on a low polyphenol diet) .   Table 1: Summary of study procedures

9/3/2021  Participants will still be eligible if they consume less than or equal to two (2) cups of  fruits 
and vegetables combined per day before Visit #2.  Visit 3 will continue  even if the participant 
did not adhere to the low polyphenol diet.   
Wild blueberry/placebo intervention:  wild blueberry  containing foods (i.e., wild blueberry 
powder or wild b lueberry extract) or identical placebo -containing foods will be consumed  
starting on the day of study visit #2 until the  morning of visit  #3 (total of 6 days on blueberry 
or placebo) .  These food items have been designed in collaboration with the University of 
Arkansas Department of Food Science and may consist of oatmeal bars, beverages, ice pops, 
and cookies. Participants will receive product combinations that deliver  up to 30g of wild  
blueberry powder per day  (or the equivalent anthocyanin content in the case of products 
containing wild blueberry extract) or placebo . Parents and participants will keep a daily log 
which will be used to assess compliance  with blueberry/placebo containing products and 
low polyphenol diet.  Research staff may contact [CONTACT_889971], 
email, or text  to inquire about their experience, perceived barriers with adhering to the 
intervention and to their  goals . Participants will be asked to complete the Study Product Log 
book of what was consumed.  
Study Diet C oaching : Participants will be educated by a trained nutritionist on how to avoid 
polyphenol rich foods . A sample low polyphenol  meal plan will be  provided to the 
participants  if needed .  
Medical History : an interviewer -administered medical history questionnaire will be  
conducted . 
Anthropometrics : Anthro pometric measurements (body weight,  height, waist and hip 
circumference) will be obtained using s tandardized techniques, while the children are 
wearing light clothing and without shoes. All anthropometric measures will be made in 
duplicate, or triplicate if not within acceptable agreement.  
Body Composition:   Body composition will be assessed using Dual -Energy X -ray 
Absorptiometry (DXA; Horizon -A with Advanced Body Composition™, Hologic, Bedford, 
MA).  Measures  of body composition are needed to standardize peak VO2 (see below) to lean 
body mass content. DXA  technology involves very small amounts of ionizing radiation. Total

InnerCore™ V isceral Fat Assessment) which can separate the adipose tissue depot into 
visceral and subcutaneous fat mass by [CONTACT_746] a scan of <3 min . 
Vital signs : Blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature will be assessed using 
standard techniques at each vis it. 
Fitness test (peak VO2) : A graded exercise test will be performed to determine peak oxygen 
uptake (peak VO2) . A bicycle fitness test will be conducted. During this test, the resistance of 
the stationary bicycle is gradually increased. The children will be told that they are free to 
stop the test at any time if they do not want to continue, but will be encouraged  to perform 
maximally. During the test, the children will be required to wear an indirect calorimetry face 
mask in order to assess their oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] (RER; VCO2/VO2). Heart rate monit ors will be worn to measure 
heart rate during the exercise test. Ample time will be given for familiarization with the 
stationary bicycle, face mask, and heart rate monitor. Children will be educated in how to 
assess their exertion levels, and will be aske d to provide a rating of self -perceived exertion 
every minute during the test using the children’s OMNI scale. This is a numerical scale from 
0 to 10, with a score of 2 indicating “a little tired” and a score of 9 indicating “very, very tired,” 
with associ ated pi[INVESTIGATOR_337835]. Peak VO2 will be determined 
by [CONTACT_889972]: heart rate of ≥185 beats per min, and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_63760] ≥ 1.0; and/or ratings of perceived exertion on the children’s OMNI scale ≥ [ADDRESS_1246055] (with M.Sc. in exercise physiology) with expertise in these procedures. Other 
research staff that have been trained in these measurements and certified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Elisabet 
Borsheim (Director of the Physical Activity Core at ACNC) may also conduct these 
measurements.

be completed at visit 
1. Parent s (or 
caregivers)  will be 
asked to keep a log 
of what their child 
eats while on a low 
polyphenol diet  (7

will be reviewed to assess compliance with the stud y diet before Visits 2 and 3.   
Stool, urine , and saliva sample  collection : Stool samples will be collected and may be used 
to analyze the microbiome, polyphenol  content , and polyphenol derived metabolites  (table 
1). Parents will be given the option to collect the child’s stool sample at home. Instructions 
and supplies will be provided. Urine will be collected  to measure wild -blueberry derived  
metabolites , marker s of bone metabolism , and overall metabolic health .    A urine sample will 
be collect ed the morning of visit #2.  Urine will be collected before and following a single 
dose of blueberry or placebo containing food s on study visit #3 .  Saliva will be collected on 
visits #2 and #[ADDRESS_1246056]  at visits #2 and #3. Up t o 75 ml of  blood will be collected  during the

blood draws need to be repeated, the total amount of blood drawn  for this study will not 
exceed 7 5 ml.   
Plasma/serum may  be used to measure levels of polyphenols, polyphenol -derived 
metabolites , and markers  of cardiovascular health  (e.g., lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], glucose, etc.). Whole blood, 
plasma  or serum from this study may be used in in vitro experiments to assess the immune 
response to blueberry compounds (e.g.  blueberry phenolics and blueberry volatiles), or the 
response of cells that have been either purchased (e.g., mouse  or human monocyte 
macrophages) or collected in other research studies ( e.g., human derived macrophages) 
where immune responses in relation to nutrition  in health and disease  are an outcome of 
interest.  The profile of innate and adaptive immune cells in children participatin g in this 
study enriched products will be measured with flow cytometry. In addition, immune stress 
tests in whole blood will be done to assess immune cell responsiveness to immune stressors . 
Markers of oxidat ive stress  (e.g., plasma protein carbonyls , malo ndialdehyde, 8-Hydroxy -2'-
Deoxyguanosine , and glutathione status , etc.), inflammation  (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate , and pro -inflammatory cytokines , etc. ), platelet  mitochondria function 
platelet  activation/reactivity  as well as metabolomics  analyses (to characterize the 
metabolite signature [CONTACT_121] a dietary  pattern  rich in wild blueberries)  may  be 
conducted . Sexual hormones  will be measure d to complement assessment of pubertal status . 
We may conduct gene expression analyses  on circulating  immune cells and  blood 
osteoblasts. We have previously shown that osteoblast senescence is delayed in mice 
supplemented with wild blueberries (11). Single cell RNA seque ncing and /or gene 
expression tests such as GPR109A, osteocalcin, alkalin phosphoatase, NFkB, beta -catenin, 
among other. The proposed genetic analyses  will not be used to diagnose disease but will be 
used as markers of  bone, immune , and metabolic health.  
Endothelial function : Endothelial Function will be measured on visits #2 and #3 using 
ultrasound (GE Vivid 7 Ultrasound system with 5.0 -13.0 mHz linear transducer, GE

9/3/2021  technology uses sound waves (ultrasound) to visualize the diameter of the brachial artery. A 
baseline image of the brachial artery will be recorded at rest. Three ECG electrodes will be 
placed on the torso of the subject, such that ultrasound measurement s will be captured at 
identical times during the cardiac cycle (i.e. ECG -gating of ultrasound images). A blood 
pressure cuff will be placed around the lower arm (the opposite arm that was used for 
measuring blood pressure) and the cuff will be inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic pressure 
for 5 minutes, followed by [CONTACT_889973]. The diameter of the brachial artery will 
be measured using edge detection software (Vascular Tools, Medical Imaging Applications, 
IA, [LOCATION_003]) from ultrasound images captur ed during the R wave of the cardiac cycle (via ECG -
gating) throughout the [ADDRESS_1246061] that uses non -invasive sound waves 
for imaging. There may be some discomfort from the blood pressure cuff since it will be 
applied tightly on the forearm.  If the measurement is uncomfortable for the participant, and 
he/she requests to stop, then the procedure will be immediately aborted.  FMD 
measurements will be done primarily by a registered clinical exercise physiologist with 
expertise in this procedure . However,  other research staff trained and certified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Keshari Thakali (Director of the vascular physiology laboratory at ACNC) ma y conduct this 
measurement.   FMD will be measured in the fasted state  in visits #2 and #[ADDRESS_1246062] (visit #3 only) . 
Questionnaires:  A food frequency questionnaire, a medical history questionnaire, s elected 
questions form the National Survey of Children’s Health , and a self -assessment questionnaire 
of pubertal status will be done at enrollment (12). Participants will have privacy to answer 
the pubertal status self -assessment questionnaire. Assessment of pubertal status is  need ed 
as measurements of bone metabolism are part of the present study. Puberty is known to 
dramatically affect bone turnover and metabolism (13). Physical examination for puberty 
staging is unacceptable outside the clinical setting thus  self-assessment questionnaires have 
become  the tool of choice in research  studies .

antibiotic intake may affect these measurements   
 
Risks and Bene fits 
We do not foresee any potential major adverse events associated with this protocol. Most 
procedures are minimal risk. Risk to confidentiality of personal information will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_889978]. Dual -Energy X -ray 
Absorptiometry (DXA) scanners use low -dose X -rays during the measurement, which may 
concern some participants/participants’ parents; however, the ionizing radiation exposure 
during a DXA scan is among the lowest found in medical procedure s of this kind (about one 
tenth of a clinical chest X -ray), and is equivalent to less than two days of natural background 
radiation. There is a small risk that the participants may have an unknown allergy to the

associated with exercise or the mask that is worn which is normal.  If the participant does 
not tolerate the mask and requests to stop the test, the study visit will be terminated  and the 
part icipant will not be allowed to continue in the study.  There  is a minor  risk that 
participants will encounter bruising and/or infection after having blood taken, however, the 
use of well -established blood draw techniques, and antiseptic procedures, by [CONTACT_889979], will ensure minimal risk. Participants may also experience sickness or 
dizziness associated with blood draw and fasted state.  However, this and any other 
procedure s can be aborted at any time at the request of the participant.   Genetic te sting may 
present a unique risk to human research subjects.  These involve medical, psychosocial and 
loss of confidentiality. To minimize these risks, participate names will be removed from the 
samples, and kept in secure and badge access only laboratories . In addition,  the proposed 
tests are for research purposes only, that is, they will not be used as diagnostic tests for any 
disease or illness and will not be placed in medical records  or shared with treating 
physicians.  
In the event of an adverse event or unanticipated problems, this will be reported to 
the study PIs, the IRB, and the study sponsor in accordance with IRB Policy 10.2.  
There will be no direct benefits to the study participants; however, knowledge gained 
from the study could potentially ben efit patients in the future.  
 
Data Handling and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_889964]. All data and communications will be recorded in either electronic or paper copy 
standardized case report f orms.  Survey and questionnaire data will be entered directly into 
REDCap or Remark Web Survey Professional on study iPads when possible by [CONTACT_4317], 
with paper versions of all forms to be used as back -up in the instance that iPads are 
unavailable. Remark Web Survey Professional will be used with participants ID only and 
theref ore no identifiers will be available on the Remark Web Survey Professional. All data

9/3/2021  and communications will be recorded in standardized case report forms or directly in the 
ACNC clinical relational database (MS Access, Redmond, CA) . Data will be collected  and 
managed using the ACNC clinical relational database (MS Access, Redmond, CA). The data 
integrity will be password protected. Data analyses will be performed from queries which 
will not change and/or modify the original data from the tables. This datab ase will be 
housed on a shared drive backed up nightly off -site Monday – Friday. Access to our server 
is password protected, as is access to the study database(s). Only faculty and staff who have 
had appropriate CITI training have access to study database( s) with participant identifiers.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_889965], the quality of the data and the integrity of the study. All study 
subject material will be assigned a unique id entifying code or number  (e.g. participant  ID). 
The key to the code will be kept in a shared network folder with access granted only to 
study staff who have had appropriate CITI training. Only study investigators/staff will have 
access to the code and info rmation that identifies the subject in this study. At the 
conclusion of the study, the data will be stored in the database and/or secure server.  
Specimen Handling and Storage   
During the consent process, parents will be given the option to allow banking of 
specimens obtained from their child over the course of the study. Participants ’ names will be 
removed from s pecimens . Specimens will be  stored  indefinitely for potential use in future 
research studies that are within the scope of the current one. Urine, stool , and blood samples 
will be stored in freezers in locked laboratories at Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Center and 
Arkansas Children’s Resea rch Institute. Participants may choose to withdraw permission for 
banking at any time they decide. A letter or e -mail addressed to the principal investigators 
expressing their desire to withdraw their consent would suffice. Consent for banking will be 
sepa rate from consent to participate in the current study. Choosing not to have their 
specimens stored for future analyses will not affect their eligibility for this study. 
Participants may call the investigators or research staff to obtain more information if  needed.

9/3/2021  Statistical analysis:  Based on means and standard deviations observed in previous similar 
studies, our primary outcome will have in excess of 80% power to detect statistical 
significance among the study groups testing at the 5% leve l of significance.  This calculation 
assumes that we have at least n=9 subjects in each of our four combinations of gender and 
blueberry status. This being the case, we propose to recruit n=11 subjects in each 
combination of gender and blueberry status (n=44 total, 22 per study arm) to compensate 
for a reasonable level of dropout that may occur.  Power and sample size calculations were 
performed by [CONTACT_78718] 9.4 Proc Power .  David Williams, PhD, ACNC statistician  will be in charged 
randomization process. Prior to  analyses, data will be checked for potential outliers and 
aberrant measurements. Additionally, the data will be also checked for conformity with 
distributional assumptions of the proposed statistical models. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
or its non-parametric variants will be used to assess differences among gender and 
blueberry diet combinations. Significance will be declared at the [ADDRESS_1246064] of WBB supplementation, 
the potential modifier will be added into the ANOVA thus making an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA). The slope of the modifier will be allowed to depend on WBB status; that is, there 
will be a slope for the placebo group and one for the WBB group.  
Reimbursement  
The compensation per visit are $50 for vis it #1, $50 for visit #2, and $ 175  for visit #3 (Total 
$275). If the participant decides not to complete the study , is unwilling, or unable  to 
complete an assessment, a $[ADDRESS_1246065] or check will be provided.   
In the event that blood draw s or other measurements  need to be repeated  and re -
scheduled  due to technical problems (but not participant refusal to blood draw), an 
additional $[ADDRESS_1246066] or check will be provided .  
 
Ethical Considerations

submitted to any study procedure.   Parents may also be contact[CONTACT_889980] (s) to 
confirm appointments  and ensure eligibility.  All parents and children for this study will be 
provided with a consent/assent form describing this study and providing sufficient 
information in language suitable for them to make an informed decision about their 
participation in  this study.  A copy of the consent/assent may be mailed or e -mailed to them 
for information after successful telephone screening. Upon arrival to the ACNC, the 
consent/assent process will take place in a quiet and private room, and children and 
parents may  take as much time as needed to make a decision about their 
participation.   Participation privacy will be maintained and questions regarding 
participation will be answered.   No coercion or undue influence will be used in the consent 
or assent process.  Pote ntial participants will be asked if their information can be saved for 
consideration for future studies and their responses will be documented. The person 
obtaining consent and assent will outline the risks, benefits, and requirements of the study 
as well as review all study procedures and the informed consent/assent documents with 
the child and parent.  If eligible and interested in enrollment, informed consent will be 
obtained from the parent and documented, and assent will be obtained from the child and 
documented. A copy of the signed consent and assent will be given to the participant, and 
the informed consent process will be documented in each subject’s research record.

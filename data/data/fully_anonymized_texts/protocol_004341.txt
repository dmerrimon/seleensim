[ADDRESS_229785]  
Catheter ablation with pulmonary vein (PV) isolation is a commonly performed strategy 
employed for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, ablation in the posterior wall of the 
left atrium can cause thermal  injury to the esophagus. Thermal injury is very common and 
occurs  in up to 40% of AF ablations per some studies. When significant thermal injury to the 
esophagus occurs, two significant complications can arise: 1) the formation of an atrio -
esophageal fist ula, and 2) gastrointestinal dysmotility. While the occurrence of fistula is rare, it is 
a very important complication since it is often fatal. Currently luminal esophageal temperature 
monitoring is the most commonly employed modality to prevent such injur y. However, there are 
8 
 limitations to its use, and atrio -esophageal fistulas continue to be a major problem in AF ablation 
even when using esophageal temperature monitoring. Esophageal deviation using either a 
Transesophageal ec hocardiogram (TEE) or Esophag ogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) probe has 
been described in the literature, but the effectiveness and practicality of these techniques are 
suboptimal, and have therefore precluded their use in routine clinical practice. Recently, 
esophageal deviation using off -the-shelf equipment (a soft thoracic tube and endotracheal 
stylet) was tested in the randomized double -blind multicenter study “Deviating the Esophagus in 
Atrial Fibrillation Ablation (DEVIATE -AF)”. In that study the standard practice (i.e., use of luminal 
esophageal temperature monitoring) was compared to esophageal deviation using off -the-shelf 
equipme nt. The results were very encouraging showing that esophageal deviation allowed for 
significant reductions in esophageal temperature and proportion of premat ure ablation 
terminations. Importantly, esophageal deviation allowed the isolation all PVs in the treatment 
group, which was not the case in the control group. One major limitation in the DEVIATE -AF trial 
was that off -the-shelf equipment tool was challengi ng to use. The aim of the Esophageal 
Deviation in Atrial Fibrillation Ablation  study is to test the feasibility and safety of moving  the 
esophagus using a specialized esophageal deviation tool  (DV8, Manual Surgical Sciences, 
Minneapolis, MN) .

 3. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
  
Catheter ablation is a commonly performed procedure employed for the treatment of drug 
resistant atrial fibrillation (AF). For paroxysmal AF, the ablation typi[INVESTIGATOR_193302] 
(PV) isolation, and in cases of persistent AF of ten involves additional linear ablation lesions , 
ablation of sites of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFE) , and ablation of drivers of AF . 
However , when ablation lesions are placed in the posterior left atrial (LA) wall during the above -
mentioned  steps, these lesions can cause thermal injury to the adjacent esophagus. This can 
result in 1) esophageal erosions and/or ulcers – which can culminate in fatal atrio -esophageal 
fistula formation, and 2) gastrointestinal dysmotility such as gastroparesis a s a result of damage 
to the peri -esophageal vagal plexus.  
To minimize the chance of these complications, electrophysiologists employ different strategies 
to minimize esophageal injury. A widely accepted and recommended strategy is to deploy a 
transnasal o r transoral temperature sensing probe into the esophagus to detect esophageal 
heating during ablation; this allows the physician to either modulate the level of energy used or 
to terminate any individual ablation lesion that results is inappropriate heatin g of the esophagus. 
While this approach has been shown to reduce esophageal injury, it is clear that this is an 
imperfect tool as evidenced by [CONTACT_193318]. In addit ion, even if the detection of esophageal temperature 
rise is identifiable in all cases, this still necessitates that the operator stop ablation and wait for 
the temperature to passively cool before applying another ablation lesion. This adversely 
impacts p rocedure time, and (by [CONTACT_193319]) might even impact on the long -term durability of the PV isolating lesion set.  
Recently, the randomized double -blind multicenter study “Deviating the Esophagus in Atr ial 
Fibrillation Ablation (DEVIATE -AF) demonstrated that the esophagus can be successfully 
displaced in patients undergoing AF ablation using off -the-shelf equipment (a soft thoracic tube 
and endotracheal stylet. One major limitation in the DEVIATE -AF trial was that off -the-shelf 
equipment tool  was challenging to use. The aim of the Esophageal Deviation in Atrial Fibrillation 
Ablation  study is to test the feasibility and safety of moving  the esophagus using a specialized 
esophageal deviation tool  (DV8, Manual Surgical Sciences, Minneapolis, MN) .

 4 INTRODUCTION, RATIONALE, PRELIMINARY DATA  
Introduction and Rationale:  
Role of catheter ablation:  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a disorder affecting more than [ADDRESS_229786] demonstrated the superiority of catheter 
ablation over medical treatment for AF, in terms of maintenance of sinus rhythm and improved 
symptoms (1,2,3,4,5). PV isolation is a procedure that involves placing circumferential and 
importantly transmural lesions around all the PVs to electrically isolate the veins fr om the rest of 
the left atrium (LA). This procedure alone is successful for 70 –90% of patients with paroxysmal 
AF (6), the effectiveness largely depending on the contiguity and transmurality of these 
circumferential lesions around the PV. Catheter ablation of persistent AF on the other hand 
usually involves a hybrid strategy, incorporating PV  isolation  with further ablation, typi[INVESTIGATOR_193303] , complex fractionated electrogram ablation , and/or ablation of drivers of 
AF that need to be performed  in various locations in the LA including the posterior wall of the LA 
(7,8) which lies in  close proximity to the esophagus .  
Gastro -esophageal injury:  While the overall complication rates of catheter ablation of AF have 
decreased (major complication rates in large centers are in the 2 -3% range) with advancements 
in technique and technology of catheter ablation, the threat of gastro -esophageal damage due 
to thermal injury from ablation remains. In fact , the risk of atrio -esophageal fistula formation 
remains one of the most dreaded complications of catheter based AF ablation today.  
Thermal injur y during AF ablation can occur in the form of esophageal erythema, hemorrhage, 
erosions, ulceration, gastro -esophageal motility disorders or rarely atrio -esophageal fistulas. 
These occur consequent to the use of thermal based ablation applied to the poster ior wall that 
often lies immediately adjacent to the esophagus (9,10). It is thought that this thermal energy 
extends beyond the posterior LA wall and reaches the adjacent esophagus causing damage 
that manifests as described above. In patients undergoing r adiofrequency (the most common 
thermal based energy source) catheter ablation of AF, the reported incidence of any esophageal 
injury varies from 2.2% - 48%.  The incidence of the often catastrophic atrio -esophageal fistula 
however, is much lower at around 0 .04% (11). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the clinical presentation of such fistulae 
occurs late after the procedure (usually within the first 2 weeks) (9,10). The symptoms are 
usually nonspecific, including fever, neurological abnormalities, gastrointestinal bleeding, and 
sepsis. This condition is often fatal. The mechanism of esophageal injury is thought to be to 
thermal injury (9,10,12,13). The degree of variation in the reported incidence of esophageal 
damage (2.2 - 48%) is likely accounted for by [CONTACT_193320] (e.g. - temperature monitoring probe), use of general anesthesia versus conscious 
sedation, magnitude of power, duration and contract force during ablation and finally the method 
of assessment of esophageal injury. An eff ective strategy to reduce gastro -esophageal injury is 
therefore of significant clinical importance.  
11 
 Esophageal protection strategies : Several strategies have been described to help prevent or 
reduce gastro -esophageal injury during AF ablation. These include luminal esophageal 
temperature (LET) monitoring (14), determination of the anatomical relationship of the 
esophagus to the posterior LA with pre -procedural or real time imaging (15,16,17) and 
modulation of power and duration of radiofrequency lesio ns (18). The effectiveness of the above 
approaches, even when applied in combination, has failed to prevent atrio -esophageal fistula 
formation  (17). Moreover, these strategies do not address the need for reduction of other forms 
of injury , such as gastroes ophageal motility disorders that originate from injury of vagal nerves 
that surround the esophagus. In addition, LET monitoring focuses on the early detection of 
thermal injury, and both 1) invariably results in a pause in ablation while waiting for passiv e 
tissue cooling, and 2) often results in modification of the lesion sets, i.e., by [CONTACT_193321]. 
Such modifications increase the risk of vein stenosis and the formation of ‘gaps’ that may 
reduce the long -term clinical success of the ablation procedure. Frequent premature lesion 
terminations and power reductions may also compromise chronic PV isolation rates, an 
endpoint critical to the long -term outcomes of AF ablation.  
Autopsy studies (19) have shown that there is loose areolar tissue between the anterior wall of 
the esophagus and the parietal pericardium of the posterior left atrium. A post -mortem study 
(19) demonstrated that the esophagus relative to the p osterior left atrium could be displaced up 
to 7 cm. Both these studies indicate that lateral esophageal displacement is a feasible strategy 
from an anatomic basis. Lateral mechanical displacement of the esophagus along the posterior 
LA as an esophageal pro tective strategy has been previously described using either an 
endoscope (20) or a TEE (21). Both these strategies had significant limitations. In the strategy 
using the endoscope, i) the actual deviation of the esophagus was unclear since concomitant 
contrast was not employed to differentiate esophageal deviation from esophageal tenting, ii) the 
esophagus could not be deviated in 2/[ADDRESS_229787] importantly, iii) the deviation could 
not be maintained in [ADDRESS_229788] 2 years the  randomized double -blind multicenter study “Deviating the 
Esophagus in Atrial Fibrillation Ablation (DEVIATE -AF) demonstrated that the esophagus can 
be successfully displaced in patients undergoing AF ablation using off -the-shelf equipm ent (a 
soft thoracic tube and endotracheal stylet) (Figure -1). The study randomized 69 patients and is 
still ongoing. Interim analysis revealed that esophageal deviation allowed for significant 
reductions in maximum esophageal temperature rises {1.1±0.7ºC vs 0.26±0.2 ºC, p<0.0001} 
and proportion of premature ablation terminations {38.8±0.3% vs 5.7%±0.1, p<0.0001}.  
Importantly, all PVs were not isolated in 2 controls due to temperature rises. In the deviation 
arm, total time and RF time for PV isolation was  shorter, but did not reach statistical 
significance. There were challenges however related to the ease of deviation using the off -the-
shelf tool , and it was concluded that the technique requires improvement.

deviation. Adjacent to that is an endotracheal stylet with a distal curve (dashed arrows)  
 
 
Because of the logistical difficulties attendant with the off -the-shelf tools and the obvious nee d 
that remains in terms of esophageal protection during AF ablation, we sought to evaluate the 
feasibility and safety of a strategy of mechanical esophageal deviation during AF ablation using 
specialized equipment  (DV8 speciali zed esophageal retraction too l made by [CONTACT_193322], Minneapolis, MN) (Figure -2). The device is commercially available in the US and 
is 510(k) exempt.  (Regulation Number 878.4800, Registered Establishment Number is 
[PHONE_4189]) Figure -2: DV 8 esophageal retractor.  
 
The DV8 Retractor™ Esophageal Balloon (DV8 Retractor) is a non -sterile, single -use, 
disposable esophageal balloon retractor. It is deployed orally and inflated inside the esophagus. 
The retractor gently and effectively retract s the esophagus to create a stable operating field. 
The DV8 Retractor has a marker band located at the proximal waist and double marker bands 
located at the distal waist of the balloon, which are distinguishable from each other under 
fluoroscopic visualiza tion. When the procedure is completed, the device is deflated and 
removed. Each balloon inflates to its stated diameter and length at 4 -8ATM of pressure. The 
balloon diameter is ± 10% at the nominal pressure. The Rated Burst Pressure (RBP) is 16 

13 
 atmosphere s (ATM). The DV8 Retractor is designed with a silicone sleeve and balloon coupled 
to a fitting that can attach to a syringe with a pressure gauge. The DV8 Retractor also has a 
fitting that allows attachment of a syringe to inject contrast medium directly i nto the esophagus.  
The device is 61 cm in  length  and the balloon is 15 cm balloon length . When inflated, the 
balloon diameter is 14mm . The detailed steps for deployment are as follows:  
Insertion and Inflation:  
• The DV8 Retractor Esophageal Balloon is remov ed from its package. The Inflation 
Syringe is filled with pressure gauge with an appropriately diluted (25 -50%) contrast  
medium (Gastrografin ).  
• The Luer-tip Inflation Syringe is attached with pressure gauge into the DV8 Retractor 
balloon inflation stopcock . 
• Lubricant  is applied  to the balloon and device shaft. The DV8 Retractor is directed into 
the esophagus using fluoroscopic guidance . 
• The balloon is positioned in the appropriate location with the distal marker band at the 
level of the lo wer esophageal sphincter . 
• The balloon is inflated with contrast medium with 4 -8 ATM of pressure as indicated on 
the Inflation Syringe  (Figure -3).  
Deflation and Withdrawal : 
• The balloon is deflated prior to withdrawing from the esophagus . 
• The deflated DV8 R etractor Balloon is withdrawn from the esophagus using a smooth, 
gentle, steady motion.

 Preliminary data:  
The esophagus was successfully displaced using  the DV8 retractor in over [ADDRESS_229789] been reported 
with its use. In a cohort study at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in [LOCATION_001], 47 patients under went 
esophageal deviation using the DV 8 tool and were compared with 114 patients who underwent 
deviation using the off -the shelf stylet . All procedures were performed under general anesthesia.  
The extent of deviation, as measured by [CONTACT_193323] t he ablation points, was significantly larger  with the DV8 tool (Figure -4). 
Moreover, the incidence of esophageal temperature rises was higher with the off -the-shelf 
technique compared to the DV8 retractor (Figure -5). Another preliminary study was conducted  
by [CONTACT_193324] -Sinai group in order to assess the optimal distance for esophageal movement that 
eliminates the chance of heating. It showed that if the esophagus is m oved by  [CONTACT_5554]  2 
cm from the ablation  site, no significant heating  occurs (F igure-6)

stylet.

[ADDRESS_229790] to safety and 
efficacy, we believe that there is value in an additional study to prove the reproduci bility of the 
findings.   
We propose a prospective single -arm s tudy to confirm the safety and feasibility of this novel 
deviation tool.

 5 ENDPOINTS  
 
5.1 PRIMARY CLINICAL ENDPOINT  
The following primary endpoint will be assessed:  
1) The extent of esophageal deviation as measured by [CONTACT_193325] a minimum distance of 1 cm between  the ablation line 
for the ipsilateral PV pairs  and the trailing edge of the esophagus . 
 
5.2 SECONDARY CLINICAL ENDPOINTS  
The following secondary endpoints will be assessed:  
1. The extent of esophageal deviation as measured by [CONTACT_193326] [ADDRESS_229791] ablation lesion for pulmonary vein isolation  
The deviation distance was based on the preliminary study mentioned above, showing that if the 
esophagus is moved by [CONTACT_5554] 2 cm, no significant heating occurs.

Patients meeting the study inclusion criteria will be identified in the outpatient setting by 
[CONTACT_56766].  
The study will typi[INVESTIGATOR_193307] (including the risks and benefits) during the clinic 
visit. Consent will typi[INVESTIGATOR_193308]. Alternatively, the patient will be 
allowed to take a copy of the consent form home to contemplate whether they would like 
to be enrolled in the study. Only patients who voluntarily provide consent will be included 
in this study. Consent will be obtained prior to undergoing the ablation procedure. 
Patients will be able to withdraw from the study at any point without compromising their 
medical care.  
Since there is minimal additional follow -up beyond routine clinical care in this study, we 
expect  to achieve > 95% rate of follow -up. 
  
21 
 9 STUDY PROCEDURES  
All aspects of the study (including pre - and post - care) are currently undertaken during 
the care of patients undergoing traditional catheter ablation procedures for AF.  
9.1 PRE- AND ABLATION PROCEDURE  
9.1.1 PRE -PROCEDURE TESTING  
The following tests and procedures will occur before the ablation:  
• Baseline swallowing impairment score  
• Collect any pre -procedural imaging of left atrium (if performed): MRI/CT 
within 6 months of procedure  
• Baseline CBC -Platelets, PTT/PT -INR 
9.1.2 ABLATION PROCEDURAL DETAILS  
• Patients will be brought to the electrophysiology laboratory in a fasting state.  
• General anesthesia will be used for all cases , which is routine practice for all 
AF ablations at MGH.  
• Venous  ± arterial access, number of transseptal punctures performed, and 
catheter selection (coronary sinus catheter, right atrial catheter, intra -cardiac 
echocardiography (ICE), and ablation catheter) will be left to the discretion of 
the operator.  
• Any 3D Mappi [INVESTIGATOR_193309]  
• Any thermal based ablation system can be used for the procedure.  
• Insertion of the DV8 tool will be performed at the beginning  of the procedure. 
The esophagus will be then moved with a goal of deviation of 2 cm from the 
ablation  sites.   
• Circumferential pulmonary vein (PV) isolation will be  performed next. 
• Bidirectional block in and out of the PV must be demonstrated after PV 
isolation (again, this is usual clinical practice).  
• Use of adenosine to assess for dormant conduction is required . 
• Per usual practice of the clinical site, Isopr oterenol  may be used at the end of 
the study protocol to assess for PV reconnection  
• After performance of PV isolation on both sides additional LA ablation is left 
to the discretion of the electrophysiologist  
9.[ADDRESS_229795] -PROCEDURE TESTING  
• Swallowing impairment score: next morning  
 
22 
 • Preferably the next day but up to 3 days after the procedure: Barium swallow  
to be performed on all patients.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_229796] -PROCEDURE FOLLOW UP  
• 2 week and 3-month phone follow up : Repeat swallowing impairment score 
(to be obtained trans -telephonically)  
9.2.[ADDRESS_229797] -PROCEDURE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT  
• All medications are left up to the discretion of the investigator.  
• Visualization of any esophageal injury should  prompt proton pump inhibitors 
for 2 weeks (per usual practice of the clinical site) , CT scan of the chest, and 
referral  to the gastroenterology service.  
• Therapeutic anticoagulation (example warfarin or equival ent agent) is at the 
discretion of the patient’s electrophysiologist.  
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_229798] -PROCEDURE DATA COLLECTION  
• At the end of the case a copy of the Barium swallow  (coded ) will be obtained

 9.3.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
The incidence of serious adverse events over the course of the study will be recorded . 
An adverse event is any undesirable clinical occurrence in a study patient, whether or 
not it is related to the study intervention. Any co ndition that was recorded as pre -existing 
is not an AE unless there is a change in the nature, severity or degree of the condition.  
 
9.3.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Serious adverse events are defined as any experience that results in a fatality or is life 
threatening; results in significant or persistent disability; or represents other significant 
hazards or potentially serious harm to research subjects or others, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_193312].  
 
9.3.3 EVENT RECORDING  
Protocol -defined adverse events will be captured throughout the period of trial 
participation.  
 
9.3.4 CA[LOCATION_003]LITY  
The investigator will assess the relationship of an adverse event to the intervention. The 
investigator should distinguish the relationship between the event and (a) ablation 
procedure (i.e. AF ablation procedure or other concomitant procedures), and (b) the 
esophageal deviation. Causality will be defined as follows:  
 
Probable  
Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, are considered with a high degree 
of certainty to be related to the intervention (AF ablation ± esophageal deviation). The 
following characteristics will apply:  
• A reasonable temporal relationship exists between the event and the 
intervention, and  
• The event is a known reaction to the interventi on, and cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_193328]/individual.  
Possible  
24 
 Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, do not meet the criteria for a 
probable relationship to the intervention, but for which a connection cannot be ruled out 
with certainty. The following characteristics will apply:  
• The event occurs after intervention, and  
• The event is not a known reaction to intervention, but cannot be explained by 
a commonly occurring alternative etiolog y 
 
Unlikely  
Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, do not meet the criteria for a 
possible or probable relationship to intervention and for which a connection is unlikely. 
The following characteristics will apply:  
• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the intervention, or  
• May have been produced by [CONTACT_80238], and there is no apparent 
pattern of response to the intervention.

INCLUSION CRITERIA  
A maximum of up t o 64 patients will be enrolled in this prospective single -center single -
arm study. Patients undergoing AF ablation (including paroxysmal and persistent AF) will 
be included in this study. Consis tent with the current definitions, paroxysmal AF are 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_193304] -terminate in less than 24 hours. Persistent AF, is defined as ≥1 
documented AF lasting >1week in duration or lasting less than 7 days but requiring 
electrical or pharmacological c ardioversion to sinus rhythm.  
• Age >18 - Age < 80 yr  
• Documentation of atrial fibrillation (AF)  
• General anesthesia  
• All patients must understand and adhere to the requirements of the study and 
be willing to comply with the post study follow -up requirements.  
 
EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
• Any reversible cause of AF (post -surgery, thyroid disorder, etc.)  
• INR > 4.0 at the time of the procedure  
• H/o of severe esophageal ulcers, strictures, varices, bleeding, laceration or 
perforation, esophagitis  
• Severe GERD  
• H/o esophageal surgery or any esophageal banding or cautery  
31 
 • H/o chest radiation  
• Significant abnormality on Swallowing Impairment Score  
• Mental impairment precluding signing consent or completing follow up  
• Patients with any other significant uncontrolled or u nstable medical condition  
• Women who are known to be pregnant or have had a positive β -HCG test 
within 7 days prior to procedure  
• Presence of left atrial thrombus  
 
PRIMARY CLINICAL ENDPOINT  
The following primary endpoint will be assessed:  
1) The extent of esophageal deviation as measured by [CONTACT_193329] a minimum distance of 1 cm between the 
ablation line for the ipsilateral PV pairs and the trailing edge of the esophagus.  
 
SECONDARY CLINICAL ENDPOINTS  
The fo llowing secondary endpoints will be assessed:  
1) The extent of esophageal deviation as measured by [CONTACT_193326] 2 cm from the ablation line for the 
ipsilateral PV pairs.  
2) The incidence of esophageal laceration as assessed by a Barium swallow study 
performed within 1 -3 days of the procedure.  
3) Incidence of PV reconnection at [ADDRESS_229805] -ablation  
4) Fluoroscopy time  
5) Procedure duration  
6) Time from start of ablation to last ablation lesion for pulmona ry vein isolation  
  
Pre-procedure testing  
• Baseline swallowing impairment score  
• Collect any pre -procedural imaging of Left atrium (if performed): MRI/CT 
within 6 months of procedure  
• Baseline CBC -Platelets, PTT/PT -INR 
 
AF ablation procedure:  
• Patients will be brought to the electrophysiology laboratory in a fasting state.  
• General anesthesia will be used for all cases  
32 
 • Venous ± arterial access, number of transseptal punctures performed, and 
catheter selection (coronary sinus catheter, right atrial cathete r, intra -cardiac 
echocardiography (ICE), and ablation catheter) will be left to the discretion of 
the operator.  
• Any 3D Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_193309]  
• Any thermal based ablation system can be used for the procedure.  
• Insertion of the DV8 tool will be performed a t the beginning of the procedure.  
• The esophagus will be then moved with a goal of deviation of 2 cm from the 
ablation sites.  
• Circumferential pulmonary vein (PV) isolation will be performed next. 
Bidirectional block in and out of the PV must be demonstrate d after PV 
isolation (again, this is usual clinical practice).  
• Use of adenosine to assess for dormant conduction.  
• Per usual practice of the clinical site, Isop roterenol  may be used at the end of 
the study protocol to assess for PV reconnection  
• After performance of PV isolation on both sides additional LA ablation is left 
to the discretion of the electrophysiologist  
 
POST -PROCEDURE TESTING  
• Swallowing impairment score: next morning  
• Preferably the next day , but up to 3 days  after the procedure: Barium swallow  to 
be performed on all patients.  
 
POST -PROCEDURE FOLLOW UP  
• 2 week and 3-month  phone follow up: Repeat swallowing impairment score (to 
be obtain ed trans -telephonically)  
 
POST -PROCEDURE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT  
• All medications are left up to the discretion of the investigator.  
• Visualization of any esophageal injury should prompt proton pump inhibitors 
for 2 weeks (per usual practice of the clinical si te), CT scan of the chest, and 
referral to the gastroenterology service.  
• Therapeutic anticoagulation (example warfarin or equivalent agent) is at the 
discretion of the patient’s electrophysiologist.  
 
POST -PROCEDURE DATA COLLECTION  
33 
 • At the end of the case a  copy of the endoscopy ( Coded ) will be obtained on 
CD/DVD.  
• Coded  fluoroscopy/CINE images.  
• Coded  electroanatomical mappi[INVESTIGATOR_193310] . 
Work Flow  
• Ensure all consents are signed and patient meets inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Baseline Swallowing impairment score  
• After induction of general anesthesia,  the DV8 tool  will be inserted . 
• PV isolation will be performed  after the deviation  of the esophagus.  
• Baseline esophageal position (record (cine) straight AP view) to be identified 
with contrast in the esophagus. Exclude from deviation if esophageal 
diverticulum is identified . 
• After maximum possible deviation is performed, cine fluoroscopic view is to 
be acquired for both left sided and right -sided ablation.  
• Care must be taken to ensure fluoroscopic imag es are acquired at the same 
level of  magnification. Care must also be taken to ensure that the esophagus 
has sufficient barium at all times . 
• Esophageal LET probe must be manipulated to approximate catheter tip at all 
times during any posterior wall ablatio n: Note:  All posterior wall lesions are to 
be recorded:  
▪ Duration of lesion  
▪ Power delivered for all lesion  
 
 
Esophageal deviation and data collection:  
• Extent of esophageal deviation measured on the electroanatomic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_193317].  The trailing edge of the esophagus will be delineated on the EAM 
system guided by [CONTACT_193330].  
• Time from first ablation to last ablation for PV isolation for all four vein s. 
• From start of deviation man euver to last ablation for PV isolation.  
• Total procedure duratio n 
• Total Fluoroscopy time  
• Confirm PV isolation at [ADDRESS_229806] if vein reconnects.  
• All non -PV ablation should be performed after PV isolation only. Above 
parameters should be recorded if additional deviation is performed for non -PV 
ablation such as CFE or atrial tachycardia ablation.  
• Obtain all Fluoro/cine images and electroanatomic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_193310].  
 
[ADDRESS_229807] -procedural care  
• Next morning; Administer SIS symptom scale and record score  
• Barium s wallow.  
 
Outpatient follow - up 
• 2 weeks/ 3 months  – Telep honic assessment of Swallowing Impairment S core 
• Any further follow up that may be relevant to complications during the procedure

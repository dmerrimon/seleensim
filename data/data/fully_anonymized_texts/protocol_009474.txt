Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  5 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Protocol Title:  An Open -Label  Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of 
Tofacitinib  in Moderate to Severe Alopecia Areata , 
Totalis and Universalis  
Site Numbers & 
Names: Clinical Research Unit  
Department of Dermatology  
Columbia University Medical Center  
Research Hypothesis:  Among patients with alopecia areata, patients with 
higher disease burdens are unlikely to have satisfactor y 
outcomes with current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Our hypothesis i s that 
a Jan us-Associate d Kinase  (JAK)  inhibitor will be 
effective therapy in moderate to severe alopecia 
areata , totalis and universalis  by [CONTACT_8616] -Υ 
pathway . This pathway is prominent in human alopecia 
areata lesional tissue , and is associated with IFN -Υ 
infiltrate that produces the cytotoxic T cell inflammatory 
response underlying alopecia areata.   
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  6 Study Rationale  Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease 
resulting from autoimmune attack on the hair follicles. The 
histopathology clearly identifies the “swarm of bees”, 
comprised of T cells encircling the human hair follicle. 
Blockade of the IFN -gamma signaling pathway  with 
tofacitinib  (inhibits Janus -Associated Kinases (JAK) 1,3, 
leading to disruption of cytokines and growth factor 
signaling pathways ) has recently emerged as an effective 
therapy in human T cell mediated diseases. Tofacitinib  is 
FDA-approved for the treatment of moderate to severe 
rheumatoid arthritis and is under study for many other 
autoimmune conditions.  
     There is genetic evidence for the importance of the 
interferon response pathway activating a cytotoxic T -cell 
response in human AA. Recent GWAS identified [ADDRESS_7901] that included IFN -gamma itself as well as its 
negative regulator SOCS1 and NKG2D ligands and 
CD8a. ˡ Many of these AA susceptibility alleles are shared 
by [CONTACT_8617], Type I Diabetes, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. 
These autoimmune states may share common pathogenic 
mechanisms and may respond to common treatment s.  
      These studies also point to a dominant role for 
activated NKG2D -bearing CD8 T cells as the likely culprit .  
Autoaggressive cellular effector CD8+NKG2D+ effector T 
cells dominate the peribulbar infiltrate in human AA and 
are intimately associated with dermal sheath cells 
aberrantly expressing NKG2D ligands.   Unpublished data 
in the mouse has confirmed the human pathological 
findings ˡ identifying activated NKG2D bearing CD8 T cells 
both adjacent to the hair follicle and in the draining lymph 
nodes.  Thus, the immunopathogenesis of the C3H 
mouse model faithfully recapi[INVESTIGATOR_8572] . 
Consistent with a primary role for autoimmun e T cells in 
the C3H mouse model of alopecia areata, disease can be 
induced in normal unaffected mice by [CONTACT_8618] T cells 
from affected mice or hu mans. ²ˉ⁴  
      Based on these pre -clinical proof -of-concept studies in 
the relevant animal model, the gene tic evidence for the 
relevance of the interferon -γ pathway in human alopecia 
areata, and the lack of existing evidence -based data for 
any treatment in alopecia areata, there is a strong 
rationale for testing Jak1,2, & 3 inhibitor treatment in this 
disease.    
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  7 Study Objectives:  
Primary:  
Secondary:  The study’s primary efficacy endpoint  will be the 
proportion of responders at the end of  treatment, which 
may be up to between 24 weeks/6 months to 72 
weeks/ 18 months of treatment, with response defined 
as 50% or g reater hair re -growth from baseline as 
assessed by [CONTACT_8619] - week 
[ADDRESS_7902] definition for defining 
responders and non -responders and was chosen to 
minimize the potential for spontaneous remission, in 
which fewer than 10% are expected to achieve this 
magnitude of hair regrowth spontaneously . 
 
As additional secondary endpoints, efficacy will be 
measured by [CONTACT_8620] -growth as a continuous 
variable as determined by [CONTACT_8621], as well as patient and physician global 
evaluation scores. To assess the durability of 
responses, patients will continue to be followed for an 
additional 6 months after treatment is completed.  
Response at the end of study , week 72-96, will be 
exam ined as a secondary outcome.  We will compare 
the efficacy of tofacitinib in promoting hair regrowth in 
patients with moderate to severe patch type alopecia 
areata to the efficacy in treating patients with  current 
alopecia totalis  (AT) or universalis  (AU). 
Study Design:  Open -label  pi[INVESTIGATOR_8573]  5mg to 10mg PO 
BID, for 6 to 18 months  in the treatment of moderate to 
severe AA , and alopecia totalis or universalis,  followed 
by 6 months follow -up off drug to assess  for delayed 
response to treatment and/or  the incidence and timing 
of recurrence of diseas e.  
The initial treatment dose will be tofacitinib 5mg PO 
BID, and may be increased up to 10mg PO BID, if 
clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator.  
The initial treatment duration wil l be 6 months, and may 
be extended by [CONTACT_8622] 12 additional months if clinically 
indicated with an acceptable lab safety profile, at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
Study Schema  
Drugs / Doses /  
Length of Treatment)  Tofacitinib  (5 mg to 10 mg ) will be t aken orally twice a 
day for  up to  24 to 72 weeks .

Correlative Studies:  
(PK/PD, etc.)  Our published work a nd previous studies in human AA 
have reported increased NKG2DL expression and 
augmented expression of IFN response genes in the 
target hair follicle end organ, and elevated NKG2D 
expression in circulating CD8 T cells and NK cells (Ito 
et al, 2008; Petukhov a et al, 2010).  
Clinical Correlative Studies  
Our study will include longitudinal assessment of AA 
biomarkers at baseline and during treatment to 
correlate treatment and disease status with;  
1) Histological improvement with reduced T cell 
peribulbar infilt rates.  
2) Declines in circulating and peribulbar CD8+NKG2D+ 
infiltration and in follicular hair follicle NKG2DL 
expression.  
3) Reduced IFN inflammatory biomarkers in the skin 
and blood.  
Inclusion Criteria:  Patients between [ADDRESS_7903] >30% and <95% total scalp hair 
loss at baseline as measured using the SALT score

April 23 , 2015  10 Criteria for 
Evaluation:  
(Efficacy, safety,  
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], etc.)  EFFICACY  
Primary endpoint:  SALT (Severity of Alopecia Tool) 
Scores: The proportion of scalp involvement is 
determined by [CONTACT_8623] 4 quadrants and  
estimating the percentage of the scalp surface that all 
the alopecic areas would occupy if placed  together.  
 
Secondary endpoint:   Changes in hair re -growth as a 
continuous variable will be determined using physical 
exams and Canfield photography, as well as patient 
and physician global evaluation scores. Additionally, 
patient reported outcomes, safety measures, incidence 
and timing of relapse will be important secondary 
outcomes.  
 
To assess safety, frequent and close monitoring of 
clinical and laboratory f indings have been implemented. 
Adverse events will be captured and analyzed as a 
secondary endpoint.  
 
All physical examination findings, vital sign 
abnormalities, and clinical laboratory abnormalities, will 
be captured as AEs when deemed medically signific ant 
by [CONTACT_093]. A qualified physician associated 
with the study will be available to assess clinical signs 
and symptoms that may be indicative of an adverse 
event. Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_8624]. The proportio n of patients 
who discontinued treatment will be summarized.  
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  11 Statistics:  This is a n open -label study to examine the efficacy of 6  to 18 
months of tofacitinib  in the treatment of moderate to severe AA , 
and AT/AU . 
 
We have chosen our primary endpoint conser vatively (the 
proportion of patients with >50% improvement in SALT index) as 
a relatively strict criteria that should minimize placebo response 
rates to 10% or less (0 -1 of 10 subjects). This allows a higher 
degree of confidence that appreciable response r ates are 
attributable to drug rather than spontaneous remission.   
Historically, patients with AT or AU are even less likely to 
experience spontaneous remission  
  
Power analysis.  Based on two recently completed randomized 
trials (Strober et al, 2008; Price et al, 2009) in similar patient 
populations (moderate to severe AA) we expect placebo response 
rates to be between 6% (>50% improvement in SALT score ³ 
(Olsen et al, 1999)) and 12% (>25% improvement). We estimate 
the likelihoo d of spontaneous regrowth of ≥ 50% baseline hair loss 
to be approximately 8% and aim to detect a 40% response rate 
with tofacitinib  treatment.  
With our sample of n=[ADDRESS_7904] greater than 80% power to 
reject the null hypothesis that the response rate to treatment with 
tofacitinib is the same as the underlying remission rate of 10%, if 
we observe a response rate in our sample of 48% (a 38% effect 
size), holding type I error to 5%. If we assume that the underlying 
remission rate is 30% (the historical respo nse rate in less severely 
affected patch type AA patients), then we have greater than 80% 
power to reject that null hypothesis if the observed rate is 73% or 
above (an effect size of 43%), again holding type I error to 5%.  
 
Since this is a small open -label  proof of concept study, we 
recognize that it will likely lack adequate power to conclusively 
demonstrate small efficacy signals. Yet, descriptive summaries of 
all primary and secondary efficacy outcomes (proportions for 
binary outcomes, means for continuo us outcomes) will provide a 
preliminary indication of the effect size that will aid in the design of 
subsequent efficacy trials. To assess safety as a secondary 
endpoint, we will summarize, via descriptive statistics, the 
occurrence of adverse events for t he study group.  
Accrual projections.  The Dermatology clinic and private practice at 
CUMC currently sees 600 AA patients yearly, of which we 
anticip ate 20 -30% would be eligible (>30 % hair loss). Accrual will 
be greatly facilitated by [CONTACT_8625] t hrough our existing 
NAAF registry which includes [ADDRESS_7905] patchy type disease. Thus, 
complete accrual of 15 subjects should be feasible within 1  year 
from a pool of >100 eligible new subjects yearly.

tofacitinib will be effective ther apy in moderate to severe alopecia areata by [CONTACT_8626]-15 and IFN -gamma signaling, thereby [CONTACT_8627] -activation of CD8+NKG2D+ memory T 
cells, and aborting the cytotoxic T cell inflammatory response underlying alopecia areata.   
1.1.1 Overview of Alop ecia Areata  
Alopecia areata (AA) is a major medical problem and is the most prevalent autoimmune 
disease in the US, with a lifetime risk of 1.7%, affecting both males and females across all 
ethnic groups .⁸ Additionally, AA represents the second most common form of human hair loss, 
second only to androgenetic alopecia, and causes significant disfigurement and psycholog ical 
distress to affected individuals (Figure 2).  
   
Alopecia areata usually presents wit h patchy  
hair loss. Approximately one -third of these  
patients will experience spontaneous 
remissions within the first year.  However,  
many patients will develop waxing and waning  
disease with some progressing to alopecia  
totalis (total scalp hair loss) or alopecia 
universalis (loss of all body hair). This 
population that suffers from a disfiguring  
disease represents a significant unmet  
medical need. ⁹ Alopecia totalis/universalis  
seldom, if ever, remits spontaneously or with  
current treatment. In our targeted population of 
moderate -severe patch -type alopecia , placebo 
response rates in other clinical studies have  
been in the 6 -12% range.  ⁶̓ ⁷ 
 
Clinical development of innovative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_8577] d other autoimmune conditions. This may be due in part to the 
perception that AA is merely a cosmetic disorder. In reality, AA carries one of the highest 
burdens amongst all skin diseases, particularly among children and adolescents whose self -
image is so closely linked to their appearance. ˡ⁰      
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  13 There  are no evidence -based treatments for AA. A comprehensive Cochrane analysis 
assessment of seventeen randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving a total of 540 participants 
found no proven treatment of AA. ⁵⁴ Each trial included from 6 to 85 pa rticipants and assessed 
a range of interventions that included topi[INVESTIGATOR_8578], topi[INVESTIGATOR_8579], 
photodynamic therapy and topi[INVESTIGATOR_8580]. Overall, none  of the interventions showed 
significant treatment benefit in terms of hair grow th when compared with placebo. It was 
concluded that the effectiveness of few (if any) treatments for AA are proven. No RCTs on the 
use of diphenlycycloprophenone, dinitrochlorobenzene, intralesional corticosteroids or 
dithranol were found, although these drugs are commonly used for the treatment of AA. 
Similarly, although topi[INVESTIGATOR_8581], there is no convincing evidence that they are beneficial in the long -term. Most trials have 
been poorly reported and/or are so small that any important clinical benefits are inconclusive.    
 
This study will provide data on the efficacy of  tofacitinib in alopecia areata. One clear 
advantage of immunotherapeutic studies in the skin is the relative ease of acc ess of the 
target organ.  Shared genetic and common pathological pathways provide strong 
rationale for increasing the scope of approved ph armaceuticals (such as tofacitinib) for 
novel indications (such as AA).  Studies of tofacitinib in plaque psoriasis and  psoriatic 
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis  (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) , ulcerative colitis, juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, and Crohn’s disease are underway ( Clinical Trials Identifier  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , Clinicaltrials.gov).  Indeed, positive s tudies in any one of 
these autoimmune diseases that share a common cause could serve as the basis for 
advancing common treatments.  
 
Currently, tofacitinib is FDA -approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate -to-
severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA ) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to 
methotrexate. For the treatment of RA, tofacitinib is approved as monotherapy or for 
combination therapy with methotrexate or other nonbiologic disease -modifying antirheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs).

 1.1.2 Pathology and role of T cells in human Alopecia Areata  
CD8+ Killer T cells in Human AA  
 
Alopecia areata results from autoimmune  
attack  on the hair follicles. The relevant  
autoantigens are unknown, but the  
histopathology clearly identifies the  
“swarm of  bees” encircling the  human hair  
follicle. Infiltrates containing  both CD4 and  
CD8 T cells have been described, but our  
recent studies pointed  to a dominant role  
for activated NKG2D -bearing CD8 T cells  
that are the likely culprit autoaggressive  
cellular effectors1. Our collaborators  
recently  demonstrated that CD8+NKG2D+ 
effector T cells dominate the peribulbar  
infiltrate in  human AA that are intimately  
associated with dermal sheath cells  
aberrantly expre ssing NKG2D ligands  
(Figure 3).  
 
 
 
 
Interferon driven Th1 -response in human AA  
Consistent with a pathogenic cellular immune response, AA has been viewed a s a Th1 -driven 
diseaseˡˡˉˡ³ . For instance , elevated Th1 cytokines/chemokines (Figure 4) are seen in the 
peripheral blood of AA patients and IFN -inducible gene signatures have been described in the 
skin of AA patients.

April [ADDRESS_7907] of Type I 
interferon therapy15-25. Importantly, administration of IFN -γ neutralizing antibodies reverses AA 
pathogenesis in the C3H -HeJ mouse26,2. In our collaborators’ transcr iptional profiling studies of 
lesional vs. non -lesional C3H skin, the interferon response was overwhelmingly the dominant 
signature [CONTACT_4490] 17 of the top 20 upregulated genes being interferon response genes. Interferon 
gamma itself was upregulated, but not Ty pe I interferons (data not shown). To confirm this 
finding, our collaborators performed quantitative real-time PCR on cDNA generated from 
affected and non -affected C3H/HeJ mice, utilizing an interferon signaling and response qPCR 
array (Stellarray, Lonza C at #00189608). This array contains primers that measure the 
expression of genes encoding interferons and their receptors, components of the JAK -STAT 
signaling pathway, interferon -inducing cytokines and response genes, as well as several 
housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_8582].  The results validate the involvement of the IFN -γ pathway; the IFN -γ 
receptor 1 and the IFN -γ inducible chemokines CXCL9/10/11 (left most red bars up -regulated 
by <10 -fold in Fig. 3), are highly overexpressed in affected mice. In contrast, the IFN Type I 
response appears to be markedly repressed in affected mice, as evident by [CONTACT_8628] I interferons (alphaB, alpha 4) and their receptor IFNAR1 (bright blue bars).

Transcriptional profiling of AA scalp .  
The GWAS identified a set of genes associated with an 
increased risk for AA . In a similar global an d unbiased 
manner, our collaborators  are investigating  whether  there are detec table 
differences of gene expression detected in tissue samples of AA patients  
compared to healthy controls.  Our collaborators have conducted preliminary 
profiling of  the transcriptome comparing mRNA microarray profiles of affected 
scalp samples from 12 AA  patients and normal scalp samples from 6 healthy 
controls, and we identified approximately 148 differentially expressed, 
upregulated genes and 120 downregulated genes ( Figure 2 ). This analysis 
revealed a striking interferon gamma signature, as well as gen es 
characteristic of cytotoxic CD8 T cells (CD8a, granzyme), which is conserved 
between human AA biopsies and the C3H -HeJ mouse model ( Figure 2 ).

2.1 Preclinical Studies:  JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors effectively treat 
Alopecia Areata in the C3H -HeJ mouse model.  
 
C3H/HeJ mice develop spontaneous alopecia areata and the histopathological changes are 
identical to human alopecia including the importance of IFN -γ producing CD8+ NKG2D bearing 
T cells which are present in alopecic skin, and are massively expanded and act ivated in AA 
cutaneous lymph nodes (data not shown). As with human alopecia , we have demonstrated 
that IFN -response genes are highly upregulated in C3H/HeJ alopecic skin but  not in non -
lesional skin , and is normalized in mice treated with effective therapy  (data not shown).  
 
Consistent with a primary role for autoimmune T cells, in C3H mice disease can be induced in 
normal unaffected mice by [CONTACT_8618] T cells (either or both CD4 and CD8 T cells) from 
affected mice or humans ²ˉ⁴. Thus the immunopathogenesis of the C3H mouse model faithfully 
recapi[INVESTIGATOR_8583] C3H/HeJ 
mouse.  
 
Proof-of-concept has been provided for the  JAK1/JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib  as a 
treatment in the C3H alopecic mouse model.   
 
2.1.1 Genetics of Alopecia Areata   
Common Cause Hypothesis in Autoimmune Diseases  
The ‘Common Cause’ theory of autoimmunity  is well -supported by [CONTACT_8629]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8584], suggesting shared pathogenesis. More recently, hypothesis -free 
research strategies in genetics have shifted aw ay from linkage studies in families, to genome -
wide association studies (GWAS) in population -based cohorts. The results of these studies 
have provided tremendous support to the "common cause hypothesis"³³ and have importantly 
identified susceptibility alle les in specific genes that underlie grouped sets of 
autoimmune diseases, arguing for unifying/general mechanisms that dysregulate 
tolerance at one of several multiple end organ sites, with autoimmune destruction in the 
pancreas, joint, or skin, etc., the p otential final disease outcome. In fact, outside of the 
HLA, at least [ADDRESS_7910] been associated with two or more autoimmune diseases in 
a GWAS³ ⁴ˉ³⁵. The majority of these shared genes can be mapped onto a discrete set of 
immunological molecular pa thways.  
 
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  18 2.2 Efficacy of JAK3 inhibitor (tofacitinib) in mouse models of 
Alopecia Areata  
Here, we demonstrated that systemic administration of ruxolitinib (JAK1/2i, Figure 3f -h) and 
tofacitinib (JAK3i, Figure 3k -m) treatment prevented the development of AA an d the expansion 
of CD8+NKG2D+ T cells in all grafted recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Skin of mice treated with either protein 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PTKi) showed no histological signs of inflammation (Figure 3 i,n). 
Global transcriptional analysis of whole skin biopsies s howed that both drugs also blocked the 
dermal inflammatory signature, as measured by [CONTACT_8630] ( Alopecia Areata Disease Activity 
Index, Figure 3j,o), a transcriptional biomarker instrument that combines the CTL and IFN 
inflammatory scores, as well as by [CONTACT_8631] (GEDI) analysis.  
 
To evaluate the efficacy of JAK3i in the context of active AA, we next asked whether systemic 
JAK3i treatment could reverse established disease by [CONTACT_8632] 7 weeks after grafting, 
a time point at which all mice had developed extensive AA.  Importantly, systemic therapy 
induced hair regrowth all over the body, and likewise eliminated the expansion of 
CD8+NKG2D+ T cells and reversed histological markers of disease (Figure in the middle 
below, a -c), an effe ct that persisted [ADDRESS_7911] a more clinically relevant route of delivery, we asked if topi[INVESTIGATOR_8585] -standing alopecia areata with similar kinetics as systemic deliver y.  
In established disease, we found that topi[INVESTIGATOR_8586], as well as topi[INVESTIGATOR_8587], were both 
highly effective in reversing disease in treated lesions (applied to back skin), and complete hair 
regrowth was observed within 12 weeks following topi [INVESTIGATOR_8588] (Figure 4a,b).  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_8589]8+NKG2D+ T cells in the treated skin and 
lymph node (Figure 4c), and the normalization of the ALADIN transcriptional signature (Figure 
4d), as well as the reversal of his tological markers of disease (Figure 4e) and correction of the 
GEDI in all treated mice. Notably, untreated areas on the abdomen remained alopecic (Figure 
4a, outlined areas) demonstrating that topi[INVESTIGATOR_8590].  
 
Further, these effects were visible as early as 2 -4 weeks after onset of treatment 
(Supplementary Figure 14) and were durable 2 -3 months after the cessation of treatment 
(Figure 4a, 8 week pos t treatment, right panels).  
 
Taken together, our data identify CD8+NKG2D+ T cells as the immune cellular effectors 
responsible for autoimmune attack of the hair follicle and provide support for a model of AA 
pathogenesis . We have identified hair follicle e xpression of NKG2DL/IL -15 as potential 
proximal triggers that activate and sustain IFN -γ-producing CD8+NKG2D+ CTLs.  Conversely, 
we postulate that IFN -γ produced by [CONTACT_398]8 T cells leads to the collapse of immune privilege in 
the hair follicle, inducing further production of IL -[ADDRESS_7912] 
inflammatory loop that conspi[INVESTIGATOR_6054] t o promote Type I cellular autoimmunity .

In addition, our preliminary data to date, from our ongoing trial of ruxolitinib  (previously referred

rate of 66%  at 3 months  in patients with moderate to severe AA.  The response measure is

proposed study (data unpublished) . 
 
2.3 Summary of Results of Investigational Program  
In November  2012, the U .S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved  the first -in-class  
Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor, tofacitinib, for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
spearheading  the initiation  of kinase in hibitors for  treatment of rheumatic diseases.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_8591], a significant proportion  of RA patients do not respond or maintain response efficacy 
to therapy. Rheumatoid arthritis results with the activation of both innate a nd adaptive immune 
pathways. Cells implicated in  the immune system dysregulation  use kinases as gatekeepers to 
determine their responsiveness to external stimuli such as antigens, cytokines, and immune 
complexes. New molecule inhibitors targeting cytoplasm ic kinases such as the JAK family, 
splenic tyrosine kinase (SYK), or mitogen -activated phosphokinase p38 (p38MAPK) , will 
amend  the resul ting dysregulated immune system through distinct  paths and further aid our 
understanding of its complexities.  
In additio n to tofacitinib, at least three other JAK inhibitors are currently in phase II studies for 
treatment of RA, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (see Table 1).

Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April [ADDRESS_7913] utilized  by [CONTACT_8633]. JAK kinases are activated after cytokine binding to one or more cytokine 
receptors , leading to JAK phosphorylated -activation and  resulting in activation  of signal 
transducer and activator of gene transcription (STAT) proteins . Certain cytokines , such as 
interleukin (IL) 6, IL -2, and IL -12/IL -23, are JAK kinase dependent . The JAK family consists  of 
four tyrosine kinases. JAK -1, JAK -2, and TYK2  are expressed ubiquitously, whereas  JAK 3 is 
limited to lymphoid tissues.1 All JAKs posses s two similar phosphate -transferring domains, one 
with actual kinase activity and a  pseudokinase domain, which in turn downregulates the 
activating kinase domain .2 Thus JAKs maintain dual regulatory  function s. The JAK -STAT 
interaction is responsible for th e signal transduction of over 50 members of the 4 -helix bundle 
cytokine family, including interferons and growth factors such as leptin, prolactin, GM -CSF, 
and erythropoietin (EPO).  
 
2.3.1 Pharmacokinetics of Oral Formulation  
Following oral administration of tofacitinib ( XELJANZ ), peak plasma concentrations are 
reached within 0.5 -1 hour, elimination half -life is ~3 hours and a dose -proportional increase in 
systemic exposure was observed in the therapeutic dose range. Steady state concentrations 
are achieved in 24 -48 hours with negligible accumulation after twice daily administration.  
 
Absorption  
The absolute oral bioavailability of tofacitinib is 74%. Coadministration of XELJANZ with a 
high-fat meal resulted in no changes in AUC while Cmax was reduced by 32%. In c linical trials, 
XELJANZ was administered without regard to meals.  
 
Distribution  
After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution is 87 L. The protein binding of 
tofacitinib is ~40%. Tofacitinib binds predominantly to albumin and does not appear  to bind to 
α1-acid glycoprotein. Tofacitinib distributes equally between red blood cells and plasma.  
 
Metabolism and Elimination  
Clearance mechanisms for tofacitinib are approximately 70% hepatic metabolism and 30% 
renal excretion of the parent drug. The metabolism o f tofacitinib is primarily mediated by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4 with minor contribution from CYP2C19. In a human radiolabeled study, more than 
65% of the total circulating radioactivity was accounted for by [CONTACT_8634], with the 
remaining  35% attributed to 8 metab olites, each accounting for less than 8% of total 
radioactivity. The pharmacologic activity of tofacitinib is attributed to the parent molecule.  
 
Pharmacokinetics in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients  
Population PK analysis in rheumatoid arthritis patients indi cated no clinically relevant change 
in tofacitinib exposure, after accounting for differences in renal function (i.e. creatinine 
clearance) between patients, based on age, weight, gender and race (Figure 1). An 
approximately linear relationship between bod y weight and volume of distribution was 
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  24 observed, resulting in higher peak (Cmax) and lower trough (Cmin) concentrations in lighter 
patients. However, this difference is not considered to be clinically relevant. The between -
subject variability (% coefficie nt of variation) in AUC of tofacitinib is estimated to be 
approximately 27%.  
 
 
Specific Populations  
The effect of renal and hepatic impairment and other intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics 
of tofacitinib is shown in Figure 1.  
 
 
 
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  25 2.3.2 Drug Interactions  
 
Potential for XELJANZ to Influence the PK of Other Drugs  
In vitro studies indicate that tofacitinib does not significantly inhibit or induce the activity of the 
major human drug -metabolizing CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 ) at concentrations exceeding 185 times the steady state Cmax of a 5 
mg twice daily dose. These in vitro results were confirmed by a human drug interaction study 
showing no changes in the PK of midazolam, a highly sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, when 
coadminis tered with XELJANZ.  
 
In rheumatoid arthritis patients, the oral clearance of tofacitinib does not vary with time, 
indicating that tofacitinib does not normalize CYP enzyme activity in rheumatoid arthritis 
patients. Therefore, coadministration with XELJANZ is not expected to result in clinically 
relevant increases in the metabolism of CYP substrates in rheumatoid arthritis patients.  
In vitro data indicate that the potential for tofacitinib to inhibit transporters such as P - 
glycoprotein, organic anionic or c ationic transporters at therapeutic concentrations is low.  
Dosing recommendations for coadministered drugs following administration with XELJANZ are 
shown in Figure 2.  
 
 
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  26 2.3.3 Potential for Other Drugs to Influence the PK of Tofacitinib  
 
Since tofacitinib is me tabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, interaction with drugs that inhibit or induce 
CYP3A4 is likely. Inhibitors of CYP2C19 alone or P -glycoprotein are unlikely to substantially 
alter the PK of tofacitinib. Dosing recommendations for XELJANZ for administration with CYP 
inhibitors or inducers are shown in Figure 3.  
 
 
 
2.3.4 Overall safety of Tofacitinib  
 
Safety analyses of pooled data of tofacitinib -treated patients show a similar serious infection 
rate to biologics of 2.7/100 patient -years with opportunistic infections including  tuberculosis, 
fungal infections, and pneumocystis reported. Screening for latent tuberculosis is 
recommended. The frequency of serious infections was increased in patients over the age of 
65. In long -term extensions, a slightly higher rate of infections a nd nonmelanoma skin cancers 
was seen in the 10 -mg p.o. b.i.d. studies, and this dose was therefore not approved by [CONTACT_1556]. However, a higher incidence ratio (4.5) of herpes zoster was seen compared to other 
biologics (1.32).[ADDRESS_7914] monitoring should include initially a complete blood count (CBC), 
comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP),  and fasting lipid panel. Minor decreases in absolute 
lymphocyte, neutrophil, and red blood cell counts were seen in less than 1% of patients. 
Transaminitis was also reported, which usually responded to a reduction in dose or 
discontinuation of therapy wit h only 0.5% reaching three times the upper limit of normal on the 
5-mg p.o. b.i.d. A dose -response change in creatinine (mean <0.1 mg/dl) was seen, which 
generally peaked at six weeks and then plateaued with a return to baseline four to six weeks 
after dis continuation. However, in long -term extensions, discontinuation of therapy only 
occurred due to renal insufficiency in 0.4% of patients in the 5 -mg b.i.d. studies. The cause of 
this change is not understood. Mean LDL cholesterol increased by 15% and mean H DL 
increase by 10% with no change in LDL/HDL ratio. This effect was generally present within six 
weeks. A repeat fasting lipid panel is recommended at two to three months of therapy. Initial 
monitoring of CBC and CMP monthly for the first three months and then every two to three 
months thereafter would be prudent as this agent is used in larger, more heterogeneous 
patient populations.  
3 OVERALL RISK/BENEFIT  ASSESSMENT  
The efficacy of tofacitinib  in alopecia areata is uncertain and determination of any activit y in 
this disease is the objective of this study. The long term safety profile of tofacitinib  is 
reassuring and confirms the potential for a favorable positive benefit/risk of tofacitinib  in the 
treatment of alopecia areata.  
   
There were no adverse effec ts reported in the one publication to date regarding tofacitinib in 
the treatment of alopecia universalis.  1 healthy patient with psoriasis and alopecia universalis 
was treated with tofacitinib for 8 months.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  28 3.1 Current therapeutic options for Alopecia Ar eata 
 
There is no FDA approved drug for alopecia areata.  A recent Cochrane report (Delamere 
et al, 2008) concluded that there was no evidenced based support for any intervention in this 
disease.  Standard of care remains observation for mild disease, and lesional/oral steroids for 
more advanced cases (Alkhalifah et al, 2010a,b). In moderate -severe patch -type alopecia 
placebo response rates have been in the 6 -12% range (Price et al, 2008; Strober et al, 
2009).  Limited data is available for the response rate  in AT/AU.  Intralesional steroid responses 
are unpredictable and occur less frequently in subjects with higher disease burdens. This 
population that suffers from a disfiguring disease represents a significant unmet medical need 
(Alkhalifah et al, 2010a,b).  Evidence -based and steroid -sparing interventions are needed.  
 
Use of tofacitinib  carries potential risks, including treatment -associated infect ion. Alopecia 
areata patients as a whole are young (median age 23 -30) and otherwise healthy, which 
should mitigate risk of adverse effects.   The target population in this proposed study  is 
subjects with greater than 3 0% hair loss which represents unusually extensive disease, 
affecting fewer than 30% of all alopecia subject s, with disfiguring consequences and severe 
psychosocial morbidity. Although AA does not cause physical pain, several studies have noted 
that AA seriously impairs quality of life (QoL), mainly by [CONTACT_8635] -perception and self -
esteem, both of which inte rfere with social life.  Because AA is chronic, visible to others, 
and often difficult to treat, its impact on quality of life is underappreciated (Bickers et al, 
2006; Hanan et al, 2008; Dubois et al, 2010) and comparable to psoriasis (Bickers et al, 
2006 ). Patient advocacy groups, including National Alopecia Areata Foundation have 
developed an active disease registry of over 10,[ADDRESS_7915] set the stage for 
evaluation of tofacitinib  in alopecia areata. Tofacitinib is a Janus Kin ase inhibitor that 
specifically targets JAK1/JAK3. JAK s are intracellular enzymes that conduct signals from 
inflammatory cytokines or growth factor interactions on cell membranes that influence 
hematopoiesis and immune cell function. After cytokines or gro wth factors bind their respective 
receptors, JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Tranducers and Activators of Transcription 
(STATs), which modulate intracellular activity such as gene expression. Tofacitinib interferes 
the signaling pathway via JAK inhi bition, preventing phosphorylation and activation of STATs. 
Inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin (IL) 6, IL -2, and IL -12/IL -23 are dependent on 
Janus Kinases.  
 
Treatment results with tofacitinib has shown dose -dependent reduction of circulating 
CD16 /CD56 + natural killer cells (NKCs), with a maximal reduction [ADDRESS_7916] 
with Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors in alopecia areata. Importantly, ruxolitinib, a JAK1/[ADDRESS_7917] 
the safety and efficacy of  tofacitinib  5mg to 10mg  orally , twice -daily dosing  for up to 6 to 12 
months,  in the t reatment of 15 subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe patch -type AA  
and/or AT/AU . This initial clinical experience with tofacitinib , if positive, would provide the basis 
for considering and designi ng subsequent larger and appropriately powered RCTs.  
 
The study proposed here targets the identical moderate -severe AA patient population as two 
other preceding RCT studies that also evaluated therapeutic effects of immune biologics 
(alefacept and efalizu mab) (Price et al, 2008; Strober et al, 2009). In addition, we pr opose an 
exploratory substudy in a small group of patients with AT/AU . 
 
Since the initial writing of this protocol new preliminary findings have noted significant hair 
regrowth in patients wh o are treated with tofacitinib at a dose of 10mg PO BID. Based on 
previously a published report of successful treatment of alopecia areata with tofacitinib (JID 
June 2014. Killing Two Birds with One Stone: Oral Tofacitinib Reverses Alopecia Universalis in 
a Patient with Plaque Psoriasis. Brittany G. Craiglow, MD and Brett A. King, MD, PhD. 
Department of Dermatology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.) and 
subsequent unpublished information from [CONTACT_8675] and other investigators using tofaciti nib in 
the treatment of alopecia areata, it is evident that a longer course of treatment may be needed,  
for some patients to achieve  full response.  In addition, there have not been serious adverse 
effects noted in this study, or per the unpublished report s of other investigators who have used 
tofacitinib for extended periods in patients with alopecia areata.  Therefore it appears that 
increasing the duration of treatment may be beneficial in some patients and is well tolerated.  
 
 
2. Patients with mild dise ase are excluded since natural remission is considerably more 
likely in the early stages of disease or in mild disease (involving less than 25% hair loss) where 
spontaneous successful regrowth has been reported in up to 50% of individuals34. In more 
extensive disease, spontaneous remissions are less likely and are usually restricted to 
incomplete hair regrowth involving a minority of scalp areas. Thus to minimize placebo 
response rates this study is specifically foc used on subjects with moderate to severe

The standard dosing schedule of  tofacitinib  5mg orally  twice daily , currently  used in rheumatoid 
arthritis treatmen t, will also be used here  to begin  treatment of  moderate to severe alopecia 
areata  or AT/AU . This dose may be increased up to 10mg orally twice daily, if clinically 
indicated and at the investigator’s discretion, for a total treatment duration of up to  6 to 18 
months.  
 
5 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
5.1 Primary Objective  
 
The study’s primary efficacy endpoint  will be the proportion of respon ders at the end of 
treatment , after up to 24 weeks/ 6 months to 72 weeks/ 18 months of treatment, defined as 50% 
or greater hair re -growth from baseline as assessed by [CONTACT_8636] [ADDRESS_7919] definition for defining responders and non-responders and was chosen to 
minimize the potential for spontaneous remission, in which fewer than 10% are expected to 
achieve this magnitude of hair regrowth spontaneously.  
The duration of treatment will be up to [ADDRESS_7920] response as well as safety considerations.  
 
To assess the durability of responses, patients who achieve 50% regrowth from baseline 
during the first 6  to 18 months, will continue to be followed for an additio nal 6 months off 
treatment or until it is determined that relapse has occurred.  
 
5.2 Secondary Objectives  
As secondary endpoints, safety and additional efficacy outcomes will be assessed. Additional 
efficacy outcomes will be measured by [CONTACT_8620] -grow th as a continuous variable as 
determined by [CONTACT_8637], as well as patient and physician 
global evaluation scores. To assess the durability of responses, patients who achieve 50% 
reduction in baseline SALT score will continue t o be followed for an additional 6 months off

6 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
6.1 Good Clinical Practice  
This study will b e conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as defined by 
[CONTACT_8639] (ICH) and in accordance with the ethical 
principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the [LOCATION_002] Code of 
Federa l Regulations, Title  21, Part  50 (21CFR50).  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol, any amendments, 
and the subject informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB) approval/favo rable opi[INVESTIGATOR_8594].  
All potential serious breaches must be reported immediately. A serious breach is a breach of 
the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the protocol, which is 
likely to affect, to a si gnificant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects 
of the study or the scientific value of the study.  
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, and 
experience to perform their resp ective tasks. This study will not use the services of study 
personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been scientific misconduct 
or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure; debarment). Systems with procedures that ensure the 
quality of every aspect of the study will be implemented.

and should prevail over interests of science and society.  
 
7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Study Design and Duration  
Screening:  A complete medical history will be taken. Patients will be screened for pre -existing 
renal (basic metabolic and urine analysis ), hematologic (CBC with differential and 
reticulocytes) or hepatic dysfunction; lipid panel; prior exposure to tuberculosis ([COMPANY_003] and or 
quantiferon test)  or hepatitis; pregnancy tests will be done in women of childbearing potential.  
Assessments:  Baseline assessments of disease severity will be done. This will include SALT 
score (Severity of Alopecia Tool, Addendum 1), Physician global assessment (PGA), patient 
global assessment and patient quality of life assessment. In order to minimize or eliminate 
inter-rater variability, every effort will be made to have the same investigator evaluate an 
individual subject at each visit. Whenever possible the same investigator (the PI [INVESTIGATOR_8596]) will examine the patient’s scalp, determine the SALT score, and grade  the 
photographic images.  
Visit Schedule and Assessments  
Screening assessments and all scheduled study visits are outlined in the Table of Study 
Assessments, Addendum 2.  
Baseline to Week 24 (period on study medication)  
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  33 Patients will be seen at baseline, an d at weeks 4, 8, 12, 1 6, 20  and 24 weeks. Assessments of 
disease severity will be performed via physical exam and photography and will be objectively 
quantified using the SALT, Physician global assessment (PGA)  at baseline, and weeks 4, 8, 
12, 16, 20, and 24, and patient global assessment and patient quality of life assessment at 
baseline and week s [ADDRESS_7923] previously used for patient evaluation in the AA registry , and the 
Skindex -29 Question naire. 
Photography will be performed at baseline and weeks 4,  8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 ; skin biopsies 
will be performed at baseli ne and weeks 4  and 24; blood draws for safety parameters and 
immune studies will be done based on the attached table of study procedures.  
Optional additional biopsies and blood draws may be obtained at the investigator’s discretion 
and with the subject ’s permission as indicated by [CONTACT_8641], focal apparent resistance to treatment, as 
well as other potential unpredictable clinical occurrences. Unscheduled biopsies and bl ood 
draws will ensure that tissue and blood samples can be obtained at optimal time  points to 
evaluate the changes occurring in response (or lack of response) to treatment. The patient will 
be given the option to agree to, or decline, the additional biopsi es and blood draws.  
Adverse events will be assessed at every visit.  
 
Week 28 to 72 (Optional treatment extension)  
The treatment duration may be extended by [CONTACT_8622] 12 additional months beyond the initially 
scheduled 6 months of treatment, if clinically indi cated and at the discretion of the investigator. 
Patients will continue to be seen monthly while on extended tofacitinib treatment. Assessments 
of disease severity will continue to be performed via physical exam and photography , and will 
be objectively qua ntified using the SALT and  Physician global assessment (PGA) . Patient 
global assessment and patien t quality of life assessment will also be completed.  
PGA and patient evaluations will be based on similar 100mm visual analog scales with [ADDRESS_7924] previously used for patient evaluation in the AA registry, and the 
Skindex -29 Questionnaire.  
Photography will be performed at  all visits.  
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  34 Optional additional biopsies and blood draws may be obtained at the investigator’s discretion 
and with the subject’s permission as indicated by [CONTACT_8641], focal apparent resistance to treatment, as  
well as other potential unpredictable clinical occurrences. Unscheduled biopsies and blood 
draws will ensure that tissue and blood samples can be obtained at optimal time points to 
evaluate the changes occurring in response (or lack of response) to treatm ent. The patient will 
be given the option to agree to, or decline, the additional biopsies and blood draws.  
Adverse events will be assessed at every visit.  
 
8, 16, and 24 weeks after end of treatment (follow -up period off study medication)  
All patients wi ll be seen at 8, 16, and [ADDRESS_7925]. Importantly patients who achieved 
≥50% regrowth as measured by [CONTACT_8642] (responders) will be seen at 8, 16, and 24 week s 
after end of study treatment in order to assess the frequency and timing of relapse or to 
capture the occurrence of further regrowth.  
Relapse will be defined as any r ecurrence of hair loss in responders (subjects achieving 
greater than 50% decrease in SALT score from baseline during the first 6  to 18 months of the 
study) who had achieved stable regrowth without continued loss for at least 2 months; and loss 
of ≥25% of regrowth in patients who had achieved 50% regrowth during treatment but still had 
chronic low grade hair loss.  
Nonresponders will also be offered the option to continue follow -up in order to assess for 
delayed response. Efficacy evaluations: SALT, PGA, Pa tient global assessment and patient 
quality of life assessment will be performed.  
Blood draws for safety parameters will be conducted at [ADDRESS_7926]’s scalp will be taken a t every visit ; blood draws for 
safety parameters and immune studies will be done based on the attached table of study 
procedures. Photographs will be use d to support determination of percent hair regrowth. 
Photography will be performed using a high resolution digital camera with Intellistudio system 
from Canfield Scientific, Inc., Patients will be positioned using a laser guide, after which 
photographs of the entire scalp will be taken at standardized locations and at a fixed distance. 
Close -up photographs may also be taken using an epi[INVESTIGATOR_8597].  
 
Unscheduled Visits

used as a reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing 
authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the 
authorized form, o r used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further 
information about the authorized form. In this protocol, the investigational product is tofacitinib . 
Other medications used in the study as support or escape medication for preventative, 
diagnostic, or therapeutic reasons as components of a given standard of care are considered 
non-investigational products.

 Live vaccines.  
 Use of any investigational drug  other than study medication.  
 Corticosteroid use at unstable dose and/or superior to the equivalent of prednisone 
10 mg/day is not permitted.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_7937] of therapeutic vaccinations in subjects receiving tofacitinib . 
Due to the risk of infection, vaccination of subjects with any live vaccine is absolutely 
contraindicated during the treatment phase of the study (that is, at any time after entry into the 
induction period), as is the administration of LIVE oral polio vaccine to household contacts. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices (CDC -ACIP) recommends that subjects should not be administered a live virus 
vaccination for at least 3  months after discontinuing high -dose corticosteroid therapy (defined 
as more than 20  mg of pr ednisone per day for more than 2  weeks). In view of the long half -life 
of tofacitinib , study subjects should not be administered a live virus vaccine for a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_7938] the date and time of 
self-administration of medication at home. Study drug reconciliation will be performed at each 
visit during the treatment period.

11 EFFICACY ASSESSMENT  
11.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment  
The study’s primary efficacy endpoint  will be the proportion of 
responders after 6 months of treatment, with response defined as 
50% or greater hair re -growth from baseline as as sessed by 
[CONTACT_8642] (Figure 6) at week 24. This is a relatively strict 
definition for defining responders and non -responders and was 
chosen to minimize the potential for spontaneous remission, in 
which approximately 8%  or less  are expected to achieve this  
magnitude of hair regrowth spontaneously.  
 
SALT – Severity of Alopecia Tool  
A. The proportion of scalp involvement is determined by [CONTACT_8654] 4 quadrants and estimating the percentage of the 
scalp surface that all the alopecic areas would oc cupy if placed  
together. The following groups will be used:  
 
S: Scalp hair loss  
_____S0 = No hair loss   ____S4 = 76% -99% hair loss  
_____S1 = <25% hair loss          _____a = 76% -95% hair loss  
_____S2 = 26% -50% hair loss   _____b = 96% -99% hair loss  
_____S3 = 51% -75% hair loss  ____S5 = 100% hair loss  
 
Percentage change from baseline (% regrowth) =  
[(SALT BL – SALT F/U)/ SALT BL]  x 100% = % change from baseline  
 
Absolute regrowth = SALT BL – SALT F/U = absolute change from BL  
Body hair loss  
B0 = No body hai r loss  
B1 = some body hair loss  
B2 = total (100%) body hair loss  
 
Nail involvement  
N0 = No nail involvement  
N1 = some nail dystrophy  
N1a = 20 nail dystrophy  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6 . SALT score.  The 
percentage of hair l oss in any 
one of the four views (areas) of 
the scalp = the percentage hair 
loss x percent surface area of 
the scalp in that area. The 
SALT score then equals the 
sum of the scalp hair loss in 
each area.  
 

 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  52 11.1.1 Secondary Efficacy Assessments  
As secondary endpoints, efficacy will be measured by [CONTACT_8620] -growth as a 
continuous variable as determined by [CONTACT_8637], as well as 
patient and physician global evaluation scores. To assess the durability of responses, patients 
will continue to be followed for an additional 6 months off treatment.  To assess the durability 
of response and the incidence of relapse, patients who achieve 50% regrowth from baseline 
(50% reduction in baseline SALT score) will continue to be followed for an additional 6 months 
off treatment or until it is determined that relapse has occurred.  Relapse will be defined as any 
recurrence of hair loss in responders (subjects achieving greater than 50% decrease in SALT 
score from baseline during the first 6  to 18 months of the study) who had achieved stabl e 
regrowth without continued loss for at least 2 months; and loss of ≥ 25% of regrowth in patients 
who had achieved 50% regrowth during treatment but still had chronic low grade hair loss.  
Nonresponders to 6 months study treatment (defined as failure to a chieve 50% improvement in 
SALT score compared to baseline) will not be required to participate in the 6 month follow -up 
period  but may be offered open -label tofacitinib if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093] .  
Partial responders will continue to be foll owed to assess for delayed achievement of complete 
response. Analysis of safety is included as a secondary endpoint.  All subjects who receive a 
dose of tofacitinib will be evaluated for safety.  
 
Secondary efficacy outcomes in detail  
1. Percent hair regrowth from baseline determined by [CONTACT_8638] (at 24  to 72 weeks) and during the observational phase at 8, 16, and 24 
weeks  after end of treatment . 
2. Comparison of the proportion of responders in the experimental group with the 
historically known placebo response rate (<10%), with response defined as 50% change 
in SALT score (50% regrowth) from baseline, at end of treatment (week 24  to 72), and 
during the observational phase at 8, 16, and 24 weeks  after end of treatment . 
3. Comparison of the proportion of subjects in each group attaining global overall 
improvement SALT score of A5 (100% coverage) supported by ≤ SALT 25 at the end of 
treatment (week 24  to 72), and during the observational phase at 8, 16, and 24 weeks  
after end of treatme nt. 
4. Change in PGA (Physician Global Assessment) based on live evaluations and 
evaluation of standardized photographs between baseline, and each subsequent visit 
during the treatment period and the follow up period.  
5. Change in patient global assessment betwe en baseline, and selected  subsequent visit s 
during the treatment period and the follow up period.  
6. Change in patient quality of life assessment from baseline compared to selected 
subsequent visit s during the treatment period and the follow up period.  
7. Freque ncy of occurrence and timing of relapse (as defined above) in responders 
followed for 6 months off therapy.  
8. Safety will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint using descriptive statistics to 
summarize the cumulative incidence and types of AEs.  
9. The proportio n of patients who discontinued treatment will be summarized.  
 
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  53 11.2 Other Assessments  
Photography   
Photography will be performed using a high -resolution digital camera with Intellistudio system 
from Canfield Scientific, Inc. Patients will be positioned using a laser guide, after which 
photographs of the entire scalp will be taken at standardized locations and at a fixed distance.  
Close -up photographs may also be taken using an epi[INVESTIGATOR_8597].  
 
Biopsy  
All punch biopsies will be performed by [CONTACT_8655] a specific location and time point according 
to the schedule of study assessments  or at 
unscheduled time points based on clinical indications . 
The biopsy site will be anesthetized with an inj ection of 
1% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. After approximately 1 
minute, the physician applies pressure to the biopsy 
site using a 4mm diameter skin punch (a sterile 
cylindrical tube with a sharp edge).  The punch is 
twisted until the blade of the skin punch  has pi[INVESTIGATOR_8607]. Depending on the thickness of the 
skin in the area being biopsied, the cylindrical blade may be buried to the hub (approximately 
6mm in depth).  After the blade has sufficie ntly cored or carved out a cylinder of skin, the skin 
punch is removed.  Nontraumatic forceps are used to gently grasp the cored skin, pulling 
upward to remove the core and reveal the subcutaneous fat. Scissors are used to cut the 
cored tissue free from th e underlying subcutaneous fat.  The specimen is placed immediately 
into the appropriate media. Once the specimen has been removed, pressure is applied to the 
biopsy site with a sterile 2 x 2 gauze. The biopsy site is then closed with several simple 
interru pted sutures. Either an absorbable or nonabsorbable suture may be used at the 
investigator’s discretion.  Antibiotic ointment is applied and the area is covered with a standard 
BandAid or sterile gauze and paper tape. If the presence of adjacent hair makes  adhesion os a 
bandage difficult, antibiotic ointment will be used without a covering.  When necessary, a small 
pressure dressing may be applied.  Subjects will be instructed in wound care and will be 
advised to call the research unit if they have any conc erning signs or symptoms during healing.  
 
Biosamples  
 
A recent histological/gene expression study of synovial biopsies from RA patients treated with 
tofacitinib  noted only mild changes in cellular synovial infiltrates during treatment.  However, 
marked cha nges in IFN -γ expression was identified, with significant reductions only seen in the 
clinically responding patients (Buch et al. 2009) .  The decrease in IFN -γ production in the 
responders implies that functional inhibition of  T cell activity is important for therapeutic 
outcome. Our proposed studies will include longitudinal biopsies that could provide additional 
support for interferon γ modulation and tofacitinib  treatment outcome.   

 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  54  
Our procurement of serial biopsies, sera and PBMCs obtained at baseline and during 
treatment will provide the opportunity to correlate resolution of inflammatory biomarkers with 
treatment response in AA.  
  
Biosamples will be obtained upon entry and again after 4 weeks, and 24 weeks of treatment.  
Biospecimens at each time point will include: 1) a 4 mm skin biopsy; 2) 5 ml of blood for 
serum; 3) 60 ml of blood for PBMCs.  
 
Blood volumes for research: 60 ml of blood is required to insure that sufficient viable cells are 
available after thawing of cry opreserved PBMC aliquots to enable functional T cell studies in 
triplicate. Our experience is that viable recovery of PBMC in freeze -thawed specimens is highly 
variable and range from 0.1 -1.0 x 106 per ml of blood. Our blood volume obtained for research 
is 65 ml at one time, a maximum of 130 ml in a 4 week period and 260 ml in total over 6 
months.  
 
Biomarker Assessment  and Clinical Correlative Studies  
 
Our mechanistic studies are focused on  correlating treatment and disease status with;  
1) histological imp rovement of T cell infiltrates;  
2) reduced IFN responses in the skin and blood;  
3) reduced HF NKG2DL expression; and  
4) declines in circulating and peribulbar CD4+ and CD8+NKG2D+ infiltration.  
 
Previous studies in AA have reported elevated NKG2D expres sion in circulating CD8 T cells 
and NK cells (Ito et al. 2008) , supporting the feasibility of our approach. Here we will be able to 
correlate the numbers of CD8+NKG2D+ cells in the blood with those infiltrating the  target organ 
of patients with each other and as a function of disease status. The limited studies proposed 
here seeking an association of IFN -γ and CD8+NKG2D+ cells and clinical outcome will not, 
however, exhaust the “biobank” and all human materials [fro zen biopsy tissue & RNA, serum 
and the remaining (90%) of PBMCs] will remain banked and available for future hypothesis 
driven questions. Subjects consent for retention and future use of blood and tissue will be 
requested in the informed consent.  
 
Flow Cyt ometry Studies.   
The presence of CD8+NKG2D+ cells will be tracked in the blood and in the skin during 
treatment with Tofacitinib . By [CONTACT_8656]8+NKG2D+ involvement in longitudinally obtained 
skin biopsies at baseline and during treatment we can correlate  disease severity and clinical 
response (progression or regression) with immunopathological evidence of resolution of total 
cellular infiltration (by H&E) or loss of specific CD8+NKG2D+ cells in the skin (by [CONTACT_8657]) or in the 
blood (flow studies).  CD8+NKG2D+ frequency in the peripheral circulation will be quantified 
using freshly isolated PBMCs obtained from 60 mls of blood obtained upon entry into the trial 
and at 4 wks, and 24 wks during treatment. A portion of the PBMCs 5x106 cells will be stained 
with anti -CD4, anti -CD8, anti -CD25, anti -CD28 and anti -NKG2D antibodies, stimulated with 
PMA/ionomycin in the presence of brefeldin and stained with anti -FOXP3 and anti -IFN-γ Abs. 
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  55 The remaining PBMCs will be used for RNA analysis (see below) and viably frozen for f uture 
ancillary studies.  We will seek evidence of a comparable pathogenic T cell subset in the 
human that we observed in C3H mice, namely an activated CD25+ IFN-γ-producing 
CD8+NKG2D+ T cell.  
 
Histology and Immunofluorescence Analysis.   
As shown in previo us studies (Ito et al. 2008; Petukhova et al. 2010)  in active AA NKG2D 
ligands are upregulated on hair follicles in association with peribulbar NKG2D -bearing CD8+ T-
cells and natural killer cells. We will seek evid ence of resolution of total cellular infiltration (by H 
& E) and loss of specific CD8+NKG2D+ cells (by [CONTACT_8657]) and NKG2D ligands by [CONTACT_8658] 4 and 24 weeks.  Frozen sections 
will be stained with and anti-CD4, anti -CD8, anti -CD56, anti -NKG2D and anti -IFN-γ antibodies 
to visualize the total number of leukocytes, cytotoxic T -cells and NK cells present in the 
baseline and drug treated skin, respectively.  Immunostaining with anti -ULBP3, anti -MICA 
antibodi es and recombinant NKG2D soluble receptor (NKG2D -Ig, detects all NKG2D ligands, 
R & D systems) will determine whether NKG2DL “danger/stress” signals are down modulated.  
Punch biopsies from patient skin before and after treatment will be embedded in OCT and  7-8 
micron frozen sections will be cut. The sections will be fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 
stained overnight with primary antibodies for NKG2D ligands, receptor and immune markers. 
The following day, sections will be treated for 1 hr with fluorescence labeled antibody, counter -
stained and mounted with DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_8608]. Frozen sections will also be used to for H&E 
staining. The total number of immune cells, as well as NKG2D bearing cells, will be quantified 
by [CONTACT_8659] n field using the NIH imaging software ImageJ and a 
student T -test will be carried out to determine significant changes in the number of infiltrating, 
NKG2D bearing immune cells to quantitatively correlate the simultaneous presence or 
absence of these cell s in lesional skin and in circulation (by [CONTACT_1603]) during active disease or in 
remission.   
 
Analysis of Gene Expression by [CONTACT_8660] -PCR  
We will analyze the transcriptional expression signature [CONTACT_8672] -
response genes in the skin and P MBC of drug -treated AA patients using qPCR  as an 
indirect measure of the efficacy of tofacitinib . Signature [CONTACT_8673]. unaffected C3H mice (Carroll et al. 2002) , and on 
published studies on human AA patients vs. controls (Subramanya et al. 2010)  The genes in 
the list represent mediators and effectors of the IFN response, which we found to be 
instrumental in disease pathology. Briefly, biopsies and peripheral blood from baseline and 
tofacitinib  treated patients will be collected at 0, 4, and [ADDRESS_7944] to revert to a basal level of expression, as compared in 
unaffected skin of an AA patient, or skin from a healthy control.  
 
Serum inflammatory biomarkers  
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  56 Serum (5 ml) will be obtained at baseline and during treatment and assessed for resolution of 
elevated levels of IFN -inducible chemokines.   
12 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrenc e or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any u nfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  
 
12.1 Serious Adverse Ev ents 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose :  
 results in death  
 is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypot hetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe)  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see 
note below for exceptions)  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 is a congenital anoma ly/birth defect  
5) is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may r equire intervention [e.g., 
medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition 
above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospa sm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also 
considered an important medical event.  (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential 
DILI.)  
Suspected transmission of an inf ectious agent (e.g., pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the 
study drug is an SAE.  
Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs and s hould 
also be reported to the IRB and appropriate regulatory bodies  in an expedited manner.  
NOTE: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
 a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8610] 24  hours that 
does not re sult in admission (unless considered an “important medical event” or a 
life-threatening event)  
 
 
Tofacitinib in AA, AT, AU  
April 23 , 2015  57  elective surgery planned before signing consent  
 admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
 routine health assessment requiring admission  for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., 
routine colonoscopy)  
 medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state that was 
planned before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
 admission encountere d for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e .g., lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative).  
 
12.2 Nonserious Adverse Events  
Nonseri ous adverse events are all adverse events that are not classified as SAEs.  
 
12.3 Assignment of Adverse Event Intensity and Relationship to 
Tofacitinib  
All adverse events, including those that are serious, will be graded by [CONTACT_8662]:  
 Mild (Grade 1): awareness of event but easily tolerated

 Severe  (Grade 3): inability to carry out usual activity  
 Very Severe (Grade 4): debilitating; significantly incapacitates sub ject despi[INVESTIGATOR_8611].  
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship to investigational product as 
determined by a physician should be used:  
 Related:  There is a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product administ ration 
and the adverse event.  
 Not Related:  There is not a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product 
administration and the adverse event.  
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there are 
facts (e. g., evidence such as de -challenge/re -challenge) or other arguments to suggest a 
positive causal relationship.

individual symptoms. The  following information should be captured for all AEs: onset, duration, 
intensity, seriousness, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and treatment 
required. If treatment for the event was administered, it should be recorded in the medical  
record. The investigator must supply the IRB and appropriate regulatory bodies with any 
additional information requested, notably for reported deaths of subjects.

13 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
13.1 Sample Size Determination  
Based on two recently completed randomized trials  (Price et al, 2008; Strober et al, 2009)  in 
similar patient populations (moderate to severe AA) we expect placebo response rates to be 
between 6% (>50% improvement in SALT score) and 12% (>25% improvement). We have 
chosen our primary e ndpoint conservatively (proportion of patients with >50% improvement in 
SALT index) as a relatively strict criteria that should minimize placebo response rates to 10% 
or less (0 -1 of 10 subjects). This allows a higher degree of confidence that appreciable 
response rates are attributable to drug rather than spontaneous remission.  
 
With our sample of n=[ADDRESS_7956] greater than 80% power to reject the null hypothesis 
that the true underlying remission rate is 10% if we observe a rate in our sample of 48% , 
holding type I error to 5%. If we assume that the underlying remission rate is 30%, then we 
have greater than 80% power to reject that null hypothesis if the observed rate is 73% or 
above, again holding type I error to 5%.  
 
 
13.2 Populations for Analyses  
The Dermatology clinic and private practice at CUMC currently sees 600 AA patients yearly, of 
which we anticipate 20 -30% would be eligible (> 30% hair loss). Accrual will be greatly 
facilitated by [CONTACT_8664], which i ncludes [ADDRESS_7957] patchy type disease. Thus, complete 
accrual of 60 subjects should be feasible within 1. 0 years from a pool of >100 eligible subjects 
each year.

April 23 , 2015  61 13.3 Endpoint Definitions  
1. The study’s primar y efficacy endpoint  will be the proportion of responders after 6 to 18 
months of treatment, with response defined as 50% or greater hair re -growth from 
baseline as assessed by [CONTACT_8665] 24  to 72. 
 
Secondary Endpoints  
1. Percent hair regrowth from bas eline determined by [CONTACT_8638] ( week  24 to 72) and during the observational phase at 8, 16, and 24 weeks 
after end of treatment . 
2. Comparison of the proportion of responders in the experimental group with the 
historically kn own placebo response rate (<10%), with response defined as 50% change 
in SALT score (50% regrowth) from baseline, at end of treatment (week 24  to 72), and  
during the observational phase at 8, 16, and 24 weeks after end of treatment . 
3. Comparison of the propo rtion of subjects in each group attaining global overall 
improvement SALT score of A5 (100% coverage) supported by ≤ SALT 25 % at the end 
of treatment (week 24  to 72), and during the observational phase at 8, 16, and 24 
weeks after end of treatment . 
4. Change in PGA (Physician Global Assessment) based on live evaluations and 
evaluation of standardized photographs between b aseline, and selected  subsequent 
visits during the treatment period and the follow up period.  
5. Change in patient global assessment between baseline, and subsequent selected visits 
during the treatment period and the follow up period.  
6. Change in patient quali ty of life assessment from baseline to and each subsequent visit 
during the treatment period and the follow up period.   
7. Frequency of occurrence and timing of relapse (as defined above) in responders 
followed for [ADDRESS_7958], up to and including follow -up visits will be reported. See Section 12 for the 
SAE reporting procedures.  
 
13.4.3 Efficacy Analyses  
Since this is a small open label proo f of concept study, we recognize that it will likely lack 
adequate power to conclusively demonstrate small efficacy signals (particularly if the assumed 
detectable difference of 3 8% is not met). Yet, descriptive summaries of all the primary and 
secondary e fficacy outcomes (proportions for binary outcomes, means for continuous 
outcomes) will provide a preliminary indication of the effect size (even if smaller than 3 8%) that 
will aid design of subsequent efficacy trials.

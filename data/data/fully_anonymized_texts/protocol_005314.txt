(Kumar et al. 2011).  In GVHD, don or cells recognize the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_171748] a foreign object and mount 
an immune reaction.  Haploidentical blood or marrow stem cell transplantation has 
historically been limited by [CONTACT_171781], graft failure, and nonrelapse 
mortality.  As a result, patients with this ty pe of transplantation were previously excluded 
from this protocol.  However, modern tran splant techniques have remarkably reduced 
GVHD and have led to the increasing utilization of haploidentical donors.  The feasibility 
of haploidentical transplant ation has dramatically expanded the donor pool, making 
allogeneic transplantation availa ble for the vast majority of patients (McCurdy and Fuchs 
2015, Kanate et al 2015).  With the introducti on of Protocol Amendm ent 3, haploidentical 
allogeneic transplantion is allowed.

SCRI Innovations Study Number: MM 42 
Sponsor: SCRI Development Innovations, LLC, Nashville, TN 
Study Duration: The total duration of the study from first patient in to last patient out is planned to be 
~3 years. 
Study Centers: This study will be conducted at up to 5 centers in the [LOCATION_002] (US). 
Number of 
Patients: Up to 38 patients are planned to be enrolled in this study. 
Objectives: Primary Objectives 
The primary objectives of th is study are to assess the: 
 Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN9708 in this patient population 
 Safety of MLN9708 when used as maintenance after allogeneic stem cell transplant 
for multiple myeloma. 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the: 
 Progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years after initiation of maintenance therapy. 
 Overall survival (OS) at 2 years after allogeneic stem cell transplant. 
 Incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients receiving allogeneic 
stem cell transplant and maintenance with MLN9708. 
 Effect of MLN9708 on immune effector cel ls after allogeneic stem cell transplant. 
Study Design: This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized study to determine the feasibility 
of MLN9708 as maintenance after allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma.  
Patients will be enrolled between Days 45 an d 120 after allogeneic transplant and will 
receive MLN9708 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle fo r 6 cycles.  Up to 18 patients 
will be enrolled in the dose-escalation phase to define the MTD of MLN9708.  An additional 
20 patients will be enrolled in the expansion phase at the MTD. 
Study Drugs, 
Doses, and Modes 
of Administration: MLN9708 will be administered orally as monot herapy.  Dosing will start at 2.3 mg.  If 
acceptable tolerability is demonstrated, escalati ons will be made to 3 mg and to a maximum-
planned dose (MPD) of [ADDRESS_201493] meet the following criteria in or der to be included in this research study: 
1. Symptomatic multiple myeloma or asymptomatic myeloma with myeloma-related organ 
damage diagnosed according to  standard criteria in patie nts who receive d allogeneic

 Chromosome 17p, partial deletion [del(17p)], t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20) 
 Plasma cell leukemia 
 PFS of less than 2 years after au tologous stem cell transplant 
2. Evidence of engraftment of neutrophils (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 
>1000 cells/mm3) and platelets (platelets >60,000 cells/mm3 [dose escalation phase] and 
>50,000 cells/mm3 [dose expansion phase]) 
3. Achievement of at least a PR prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant.

Statistical 
Methodology: Safety of MLN9708 when used in this indica tion (primary endpoint) will be evaluated as 
follows.  Toxicity profile data will include ad verse events (AEs), laboratory parameters, 
vital signs, and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation.  Safety data will be tabulated fo r all patients who receive any amount of study 
medication.  Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, 
severity, and relation to treatment.  The tabulation of laboratory parameters will indicate the normal range of each parameter.  Each analyt e value will be classified as falling above, 
below, or within the normal range. 
Progression-free survival a nd OS (efficacy secondary e ndpoints) estimates will be 
generated using Kaplan-Meier methods, both for all patients enrolled and those patients 
receiving the MTD.  Two-year PFS and OS es timates with 95% confid ence intervals (CIs), 
and median PFS and OS with 95% CIs, will be generated and reported accordingly. 
Incidence of GVHD (safety secondary endpoint) will reported in a manner consistent with 
the AE reporting previously described. 
Demographic data and baseline disease characteristics will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. 
All statistical analyses will be performed us ing SAS 9.3 or the current version of SAS 
available at the time of analysis.

1.1 Background 
Multiple myeloma is a clonal disease of plasma ce lls that is characterized by [CONTACT_171787] (and other organs) and commonly results in bone marrow 
failure, bone destruction, hypercalcemia, and renal failure.  Multiple myeloma accounts for 
approximately 1% of all reported neoplasms and approximately 13% of hematologic cancers 
worldwide (Palumbo and Anderson. 2011).  In Nort h and South America and Western European 
countries, an estimated 5-to-7 new cases of multiple myeloma are diagnosed per 100,000 people 
each year (Palumbo and Anderson. 2011, Landgren and Weiss. 2009, Harousseau et al. 2008).  
In the [LOCATION_002] (US), a pproximately 20,000 cases of multiple myeloma are diagnosed each 
year and 10,650 deaths per year are due to the disease (~2% of all can cer deaths).  Although 
generally less common in Asian countries, in th ose with larger populations, multiple myeloma is 
a growing health problem, with an  incidence approachi ng that of Western countries (Huang et al. 
2007, Qiu et al. 2008). 
Although multiple myeloma is considered fatal, su rvival has dramatically improved over the last 
2 decades with the introduction of more effective treatment options.  Multiple myeloma is sensitive to a number of cyto toxic drugs (e.g., alkylating agen ts and anthr acyclines) and 
corticosteroids that are commonly used for initia l treatment and for relapsed disease.  Between 
1990 and 2007, the cancer death rate for people with  multiple myeloma in the US decreased by 
[CONTACT_3450] 9% for males and 13% for fema les owing to the intr oduction of stem cell 
transplant and novel agents VELCADE® (bor tezomib) for Injection, thalidomide, and 
lenalidomide (Jemal et al. 2010).  In addition, 5-year survival improved from 25% in 1975 to 
39% in 2006 (National Comprehensive Cancer Ne twork. 2010).  Most patients receive multiple 
lines of therapy over the course of their dis ease; however, responses remain transient.  
Bortezomib, the first proteasome inhibitor, has sh own marked response in the relapsed setting 
and is also an effective agent in the pretransplant setting (Kumar et al. 2008). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_171749], multiple myeloma is generally considered 
incurable and there is considerable need for better  agents.  In an effort  to further target the 
proteasome with improved activity in multiple myeloma and other cancers, Millennium has developed MLN9708, a small molecu le 20S proteasome inhibitor. 
1.2 MLN9708 
MLN9708 is an orally bioavailable , potent, reversible inhibitor of  the 20S proteasome.  In Phase 
I studies it has been shown to be very well tole rated with minimal peripheral neuropathy.  It has 
also shown impressive anti-myeloma activity in both the relapsed/refractory setting and the 
upfront setting (Kumar et al. 2011, Berdeja et al. 2011, Richardson et al. 2011).  These 
characteristics make MLN9708 an ideal proteasome inhibitor to use after allogeneic stem cell 
transplant.

MLN9708.  Detailed information regarding th e nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of 
MLN9708 may be found in the current Investigat or’s Brochure (IB).

Please refer to the current MLN9708 IB and its Safety Management Attachment (SMA) provided 
by [CONTACT_20555]. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_201508] investigational oral proteasome inhibitor to enter clinical trials. Phase I, Phase I/II, and Phase II trials are ongoing or being initiated in MM and lymphoma. Phase III trials in relapsed 
and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) , newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), 
and relapsed or refractory systemic light-chain  amyloidosis (RRAL amyl oidosis) are underway.   
As of [ADDRESS_201509] enrolled in 
Phase III clinical trials, either  placebo-controlled Studies C1 6010 or C16014 (and received either 
MLN9708 or placebo in combination with lenalid omide and dexamethasone [LenDex]), or in 
Study C16011 (and received either MLN9708 and de xamethasone or physician’s choice of a 
dexamethasone-containing regimen). 
MLN9708 is available as an IV and oral formul ation; however, only the oral formulation is 
currently being developed for co mmercialization.  Regardless of the route of administration, in 
the twice-weekly dosing schedule MLN9708 is given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle, and in the weekly dosing schedule MLN9708 is given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.  Schedules with longer cycles are being investigated in Study C16006.   
The following oncology indications are bei ng studied: RRMM, NDMM, RRAL amyloidosis, 
solid tumors, and lymphoma.  Ongoing studies ar e investigating both si ngle agent MLN9708 and 
MLN9708 in combination with  standard treatments.  
1.2.4 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism 
The PK of MLN9708 after IV dos ing is characterized by a multi -exponential disposition profile 
in plasma with the terminal ha lf-life after multiple doses rangi ng from 2.8 to 12.2 days.  Plasma 
exposures increase proportionally ov er the dose range of 0.5 to 3.11 mg/m
2 (0.8-6.8 mg actual 
administered dose range).  Renal elimination appears to be a minor clearance pathway for 
MLN9708 as renal clearance is less than 5% of  the total body cleara nce estimate from the 
population PK analysis.  After both once- and twice-weekly oral dosing, MLN9708 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_171750] a median T max of 1 hour.  The observed range fo r the terminal half-life after 
multiple doses is 2.1 to 11.3 days.  Dose proportionality has been observed for doses between 0.48 and 3.95 mg/m
2 (0.8-8.9 mg actual administered dose range). 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for MLN9708 coadmi nistered with LenDex (Studies C16005 and 
C16008), or MP (Study C16006), appear to be similar to those observed when MLN9708 is 
administered as a single agent.  This suggest s that there is no readil y apparent effect of

FINAL  PROTOCOL :  11 A PRIL 2014      
AMENDMENT NUMBER  3:  [ADDRESS_201510] b een noted between patients with different 
malignancies. 
After once-weekly dosing, Day 1 geometric mean dose-normalized MLN9708 exposures in 
Japanese and Asian patients recei ving MLN9708 plus LenDex are similar to the observed values 
in Western patients (Studies C16004, C16005, a nd C16007).  On Day 15, the geometric mean 
dose-normalized MLN9708 AUC 0-168 in Asian patients is approximately 45% higher than the 
observed values in Western pati ents.  A high-fat meal decrease d both the rate and extent of 
absorption of MLN9708.  Therefore, MLN9708 will continue to be administered on an empty 
stomach (no food for 2 hours befo re and for 1 hour after dosing). 
A population PK analysis has been performed using preliminary PK data from [ADDRESS_201511] 9708 as a single agent across 4 ongoi ng, Phase I studies (intensive 
PK sampling) in Western patient populations. Patients with solid tumors, lymphoma, or MM 
were administered MLN9708 via IV or PO routes using BSA- based dosing on a twice-weekly 
(Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; 21-day cycle) or weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15; 28-day cycle) schedule.   
There is a lack of a discer nible relationship between BSA and MLN9708 clearance over a 
relatively wide BSA range (1.4-2.6 m2) indicating that total systemic exposure (AUC) following 
fixed dosing should be independent  of the individual patient’s BSA.  Therefore, BSA is not 
expected to affect C max or AUC after IV or oral dosing, and thus fixed dosing is appropriate for 
both oral and IV routes of ad ministration.  The clinical deve lopment of MLN9708 has therefore 
transitioned from the use of BS A-based dosing to fixed dosing. 
Accordingly, the starting dose of MLN9708 in  the Phase III study in RRMM (Study C16010) is 
a fixed dose of 4.0 mg, on the basis of the recommended dose of 2.23 mg/m 2 (using mean patient 
BSA of 1.86 m2 from the 2208 patients with MM in bortezomi b clinical studies for conversion to 
a fixed dose).  Also, no relationship between creatinine clearance and CL was observed in 
patients with a wide range of renal function (creatinine clearance rang e: 21.9-236.1 mL/min), so 
starting dose adjustment is not required in patien ts with mild (60-90 mL/min) and moderate (30-
60 mL/min) renal impairment in c linical studies (G upta et al. 2011).   Further details on these 
studies are provided in the IB. 
1.2.5 Clinical Trial Experience Using the Oral Formulation of MLN9708 
As of 27 March 2014, a total of 491 patients with  differing malignancies (MM, systemic light-
chain amyloidosis [AL amyloidosis], lymphoma , and nonhematologic cancer s) have received at 
least 1 dose of MLN9708 in Ph ase I, Phase I/II, and Phase II studies evaluating the oral 
MLN9708 formulation.  These patients have b een treated with different doses of MLN9708 
either as a single-agent treatment (241 patients) or in combination with currently clinically 
available treatments (250 patients).  In additi on, [ADDRESS_201512] enrolled in Phase II Studies

ongoing Phase III Studies C16010, C16011, and C16014), regardless of study drug causality, are 
shown in Table 2.  Adverse events (AEs) observe d to date (as of 27 Ma rch 2014) are generally 
reversible, manageable with standard medical in terventions, and are dose de pendent.  The type of 
AEs are generally consistent across the patien t populations treated to  date, though some AEs 
may be more common either due to the patien t population or the regi men being studied (e.g., 
thrombocytopenia is more common with week ly single-agent MLN9708 in RRMM than in 
RRAL amyloidosis; in RRMM, thrombocytopenia is  more common with weekly single agent 
MLN9708 than when given in combination w ith LenDex; nausea is common across studies; 
diarrhea is more common with weekly MLN9708 in combination with LenDex than with single-
agent MLN9708).  Such differences may illustrate effects of the disease or prior therapy on the 
body (e.g., on the bone marrow) as well as the side e ffect profile of the ag ents in a combination 
regimen. 
The more commonly observed ( ≥ 30% incidence) treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) from pooled 
data across clinical studies w ith oral MLN9708 include nausea ( 47%), diarrhea (47%), fatigue 
(45%), rash (all terms; 40%), vomiting (37%), and thrombocytopenia (33 %).  The frequency of 
rash is noted in an aggregate because it is char acterized in different ways; however, it is less 
common when considering indivi dual preferred terms.  The rash may range from limited 
erythematous areas, macular and/or small papular bumps that may or may not be pruritic over a 
few areas of the body, to a more generalized er uption that is predomin ately on the trunk or 
extremities.  Therefore, Table [ADDRESS_201514] frequently reported pr eferred terms, for added clarity about frequency.

1.2.6 Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma 
The development of MLN9708 in patients with  RRMM includes 2 Phase 1 dose-escalation 
single-agent studies (S tudies C16003 and C16004). 
Across these studies, 120 patients were treated, 60 in each study (Study C16003 with the twice-
weekly schedule and Study C16004 with the week ly schedule).  The MTD in Study C16003 was 
2 mg/m 2 twice-weekly dosing based on DLTs of macu lar rash and thrombocytopenia (platelet 
count = 10 x 109/L).  The MTD in Study C16004 was 2.97 mg/m2 given weekly based on DLTs 
of diarrhea, nausea, vomiti ng, and erythema multiforme. 
At the data cut-off, with 3 patients remaining on study, the median number of cycles 
administered in Study C16003 was 4 (range 1- 61) with 33 (55%) pa tients treated for ≥4 cycles, 
17 (28%) for ≥8 cycles, and 11 (18%) for ≥12 cycles.  Across all pa tients treated, including 
above and below the MTD, dose reductions were needed once in 57% of patients, with ≥2 reductions needed in 20% of patients.

and below the MTD, dose reductions were needed once in 33% of patients, with ≥2 reductions

Final study results suggest th at single-agent MLN9708 has anti-tumor activity in heavily 
pretreated MM patients, with durable respon ses/disease control, and is generally well 
tolerated(Richardson et al. 2014, Kumar et al. 2014). 
1.2.7 Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM) 
Three Phase I/II studies are be ing conducted with MLN9708 in combination with standard anti-
myeloma regimens; 2 in combination with Le nDex (Studies C16005 [Berdeja et al. 2011, 
Richardson et al. 2012 (a), Ri chardson et al. 2012 (b), Kumar et al. 2013] and C16008 
[Richardson et al. 2012 (a)]) and 1 in combina tion with MP (Study C16006 [San Miguel et al. 
2012]).  Study C16014 is a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study of MLN9708 or placebo in combination with LenDex.  Please refer to the MLN9708 IB and SMA for further 
information. 
1.2.8 Rationale for the Study 
The use of autologous stem cell transplantati on, proteasome inhibitors , and immunomodulatory 
drugs has transformed the treatment landscape of patients with multiple myeloma (Jemal et al. 
2010, National Comprehensive Cancer Network.  2010, Kumar et al. 200 8).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_45865], the vast majority of patients will eventu ally relapse and succumb to their disease.  In 
patients with particular high-ri sk features, such as those with abnormalities of chromosome 17p, 
circulating plasma cells, extra medullary di sease, and short remission duration following 
aggressive induction/stem cell tran splantation the outcome is esp ecially poor with progression-
free survival of less than 2 y ears (Richardson et al. 2011, Drak e et al. 2010, Kapoor et al. 2009, 
Neben et al. 2012, Jimenez-Zepeda et al. 2012).  Allogeneic (u sing donor stem cells) stem cell 
transplantation is an appropriate treatm ent option in these high-risk patients. 
Allogeneic stem cell transplant can achieve better control of multiple myeloma, but carries a 
higher mortality as a consequence of complicati ons related to graft-ve rsus-host disease (GVHD) 
(Kumar et al. 2011).  In GVHD, don or cells recognize the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_171748] a foreign object and mount 
an immune reaction.  Haploidentical blood or ma rrow stem cell transplantation has historically 
been limited by [CONTACT_171788], graf t failure, and nonrelapse mortality.  As a 
result, patients with this type of transplantati on were previously excluded from this protocol.  
However, modern transplant techniques have remarkably reduced GVHD and have led to the 
increasing utilization of haploide ntical donors.  The feasibility of  haploidentical transplantation 
has dramatically expanded the donor pool, making a llogeneic transplantation available for the 
vast majority of patients (McCurdy and Fuchs 2015, Kanate et al 2015).  With the introduction of 
Protocol Amendment 3, haploidentical allogeneic transpla ntion is allowed. 
Proteasome inhibitors have an anti-myeloma effect  and are often used as either initial treatment 
or at relapse in patients with multiple myeloma.  Proteasome inhibitors have also been shown in 
pre-clinical and clinical  models to stimulate al logeneic immune cells to  eliminate myeloma cells

al. 2008, Kroger et al. 2006).  The use of proteasome inhibitors af ter stem cell transplant can 
therefore prolong remissions after transpla nt and reduce the in cidence of GVHD. 
This study investigates the role of MLN 9708 as ma intenance in patients that undergo allogeneic 
stem cell transplant for high-risk multiple myeloma and in patients with multiple myeloma that undergo allogeneic stem cell transp lant due to relapsing after an autologous stem cell transplant. 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objectives 
The primary objectives of this  study are to assess the: 
 Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN9708 in this patient population 
 Safety of MLN9708 when used as maintenance after allogeneic stem  cell transplant for 
multiple myeloma. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of this  study are to determine the: 
 Progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years after initiati on of maintenance therapy 
 Overall survival (OS) at 2 years af ter allogeneic stem cell transplant 
 Incidence of graft-versus-hos t disease (GVHD) in patients re ceiving allogeneic stem cell 
transplant and mainte nance with MLN9708 
 Effect of MLN9708 on immune effector cell s after allogeneic stem cell transplant.

Determination of Dose -Limiting Toxicities 
The patient population used for determination of D LTs will consist of patients who have met the 
minimum safety evaluation requirements of the study, and/or who have experienced a DLT.  
Minimum safety requirements will be met if, duri ng Cycle 1 of treatment, the patient receives all 
(3 of 3) scheduled doses of MLN9708, completes all required safety evaluations, and is observed 
for at least [ADDRESS_201536] dose of  MLN9708.  An isolated laboratory abnormality 
could also be considered criter ia for seriousness (e.g., results in  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171752]). 
Patients who discontinue treatment early due to disease progression or withdrawal will be asked 
to have all end-of-treatment sa fety evaluations performed as described in the protocol (see

the patient has received clinical benefit from therapy with MLN9708, the Investigator and the Study Chair may consider restarting therapy. 
*Patients on 2.[ADDRESS_201548] Risk of Infection 
Antiviral therapy such as acyclov ir or valacyclovir may be initia ted as clinically indicated and 
per institutional standards.  Other antivirals are also acceptable.  Patients who do not receive 
antiviral therapy should be made aw are of risks, such as reactivati on of herpes zoster and herpes 
simplex viruses. 
6.3.2 Nausea and/or Vomiting 
Standard anti-emetics including 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 serotoni n receptor antagonists are 
recommended for emesis if it occurs once tr eatment is initiated based on the patient’s 
susceptibility to nausea and vomiting; prophylactic anti-emetics may also be considered at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Fluid deficit should be corrected  before initiation of study drug 
and during treatment. 
6.3.3 Diarrhea 
Prophylactic antidiarrheals will not be used in th is protocol.  However, diarrhea should be 
managed according to clinical practice, incl uding the administration of antidiarrheals once 
infectious causes are excluded.  Fluid intake should be maintained  to avoid dehydration.  Fluid 
deficit should be corrected before ini tiation of treatment and during treatment.

Page 40 of 86 6.3.4 Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus 
Rash has been reported with MLN9708.  As with bortezomib, rash with or without pruritus has 
been reported with MLN9708, prim arily at the higher doses teste d.  The rash may range from 
some erythematous areas, macular and/or small pa pular bumps that may or may not be pruritic 
over a few areas of the body, to a more generalize d eruption that is predominately on the trunk or 
extremities.  Rash has been most commonly char acterized as maculopapular or macular.  To 
date, when it does occur, rash is most commonly reported within the first 3 cycles of therapy.  
The rash is often transient, self-limiting, and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_20539] 1 to  2 in severity.   
Symptomatic measures such as antihistamines or  corticosteroids (oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) have been 
successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylactically in subsequent cycles.  The 
use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], IV, or oral steroid (10mg of prednisone/day) is permitted.  Management of a 
Grade 3 rash may require intrav enous antihistamines or corticos teroids.  Administration of 
MLN9708 (and/or other causative agent if give n in combination) should be modified per 
protocol and re-initiated at a reduced level fr om where rash was noted (also, per protocol). 
In line with clinical pr actice, dermatology consult and biopsy of Grade 3 or higher rash or any 
SAE involving rash is recommende d.  Prophylactic measures should also be considered if a 
patient has previously developed a rash (eg, us ing a thick, alcohol-free emollient cream on dry 
areas of the body or oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_12669]) .  .  In the event of rash, a skin biopsy is 
suggested to assess etiology. 
A rare risk is Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a severe , life-threatening or deadly rash with skin 
peeling and mouth sores, which should be mana ged symptomatically according to standard 
medical practice.  In the case of rash, punch biopsies for histopathol ogical analysis are 
encouraged at the discretion of the Investigator. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_201549] clinical  practice.  MLN9708 ad ministration should be 
modified as noted as per dose modificati on recommendations in the protocol when 
thrombocytopenia occurs (see Table 4).  Therap y can be reinitiated at a reduced level upon 
recovery of platelet counts.  A rare risk is thrombotic thro mbocytopenic purpura, a rare blood 
disorder where blood clots form in small bl ood vessels throughout the body characterized by 
[CONTACT_12703], petechiae, fever, or possibly more serious signs and symptoms.  Thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura should be managed sy mptomatically according to standard medical 
practice.

6.3.[ADDRESS_201551] been  reported with MLN9708.  
Blood pressure should be closely monitored whil e the patient is on study treatment and fluid 
deficit should be corrected as needed, especially  in the setting of concomitant symptoms such as 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia.  Patients taking medications and/or  diuretics to manage 
their blood pressure (for either hypotension or hypertension) should be managed according to 
standard clinical practice, including considerat ions for dose adjustments of their concomitant 
medications during the course of the study.  Fluid deficit should be  corrected before initiation of 
study drug and during treatment to avoid dehydration. 
6.3.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome 
One case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, which ultimately resolved, has been 
reported with MLN9708.  This condition is characte rized by [CONTACT_12704], seizures and visual loss, 
as well as abrupt increase in blood pressure.  Diagnosis may be confirmed by [CONTACT_12705] (MRI).  If the syndrome is  diagnosed or suspected, symptom-directed 
treatment should be maintained until the condition is reversed by [CONTACT_171793]. 
6.3.10  Transverse Myelitis 
Transverse myelitis has also been reported wi th MLN9708. It is not known if MLN9708 causes 
transverse myelitis; however, because it ha ppened to a patient receiving MLN9708, the 
possibility that MLN9708 may have contributed to transverse myelitis cannot be excluded.

Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the International Myeloma 
Working Group Uniform Response Criteria (see Appendix E). 
 
CR  Complete Response 
sCR subcategory: stringent complete response 
VGPR  Very good partial response  
PR  Partial response 
SD  Stable disease 
PD  Progressive disease 
 
All response categories (CR, sCR,  VGPR, PR, PD) require two cons ecutive assessments made at 
any time before the institution of any new therapy, as well as  no known evidence of progressive 
or new bone lesions if radiogr aphic studies were performed.  Radiographic studies are not 
required to satisfy these response requirements.  Bone marrow assessments are not required to be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_15013]. 
Complete response should be confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy for morphology and a bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_171760], FISH, and cytogenetics performed locally.  Additional confirmatory studies include SPEP, UPEP, imm unofixation of blood and urine, and SFLC (see 
Appendix D). 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1 Statistical Design 
This is an open-label, multicenter, non-random ized study to determin e the feasibility of 
MLN9708 as maintenance after allogeneic stem ce ll transplant for multiple myeloma.  Patients 
will be enrolled between Days 45 and 120 after allogeneic transplant and will receive MLN9708 
on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. 
10.2 Sample Size Considerations 
For the dose-escalation phase of the study, a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 6 patients will be 
enrolled in each of 3 cohorts.  Therefore, th e maximum number of patients to determine the 
MTD will be 18.  When the MTD is determined, an  additional 20 patients will be enrolled in the 
expansion phase at either the MTD or the MPD. 
10.3 Analysis Population 
The following analysis populations will be used:

MLN9708.  This population will be used in all safety summaries. 
 The Efficacy Evaluable population will consist of all patients with measurable or 
evaluable disease at baseline who receive at least [ADDRESS_201564] eristics will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics. 
10.4.2  Efficacy Analysis 
 PFS, defined as the time from the first day of study drug administration (Day 1) to 
disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_171801] (see Appendix E), or death on study.  Patients who are alive and free 
from disease progression will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment. 
 OS, defined as the time from the first day of  study drug administration (Day 1) or death 
on study.  Patients who are alive will be censore d at the date of last known date alive. 
Progression-free survival and OS (efficacy secondary endpoints) estimates will be generated 
using Kaplan-Meier methods, both for all patien ts enrolled and those patients receiving the 
MTD.  Two-year PFS and OS estimates with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), and median PFS 
and OS with 95% CIs, will be generated and reported accordingly. 
The effect of MLN9708 on immune effector cells after allogeneic stem cell transplant will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_171802] l change from baseline at Cycle 1 Day 4, Cycle 
1 Day 8, Cycle 1 Day 15, and Cycle 2 Day 1, and th e percentage change from baseline at Cycle 1 
Day 4, Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 1 Day 15, and Cycle 2 Day 1, among those patients participating in 
the biomarker research component. Each analysis  will be performed with in dose level and total 
patients. 
The following parameters will be examined: 
 CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD45+, CD19+ and CD56+/CD16+ cell counts,  
by [CONTACT_74064]-activated cell sorting 
 Regulatory T cell counts by [CONTACT_171803]3,  
and surface staining of CD4+ and CD25+ cells 
 Inflammatory cytokine concentrations of IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF- α.

The significance level will be set at 10%, and there will be no adjustment to the alpha level for 
multiple comparisons. The rationale for the repor ting of p-values in these analyses is for 
hypothesis-generating purposes only. 
10.4.3  Safety Analysis 
Safety will be assessed through the analysis of  the reported incidence of treatment-emergent 
AEs.  Treatment-emergent AEs are those with an onset on or after the in itiation of therapy, and 
will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0. 
The AEs will be coded using Medical Dictiona ry for Regulatory Activities, and summarized 
using system organ class and preferred term by [CONTACT_171804].  In addition, summaries of seri ous AEs (SAEs), AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation, AEs by [CONTACT_171805] e, and AEs related to study treatment will 
also be presente d by [CONTACT_15994]. 
Safety of MLN9708 when used in this indicat ion (primary endpoint) will be evaluated as 
follows: Toxicity profile data will include AEs,  laboratory parameters, vital signs, and other 
protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation.  Safety data will be 
tabulated for all patients who receive any amount  of study medication.  Adverse events will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_9313], preferred te rm, severity, and relation to treatment.  The 
tabulation of laboratory parameters will indicate  the normal range of each parameter.  Each 
analyte value will be classified as falli ng above, below, or within the normal range.

11.1.[ADDRESS_201568] medical occurre nce associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not consider ed drug related.  An AE (also known as adverse experience) can 
be any unfavorable and uninte nded sign (e.g., an abnormal laborat ory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporarily associated with the use of  a drug, without any judge ment about causality.   
This includes any newly occurring event, or a prev ious condition that has in creased in severity or 
frequency since the administration of study drug.  An AE can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., 
off-label use, use in combination with anothe r drug) and with any route of administration, 
formulation, dose or including overdose. 
An abnormal laboratory value will not be a ssessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose m odification, therapeutic intervention, or is 
considered by [CONTACT_2418] a c linically significant change from baseline. 
11.1.3  Serious Adverse Event 
An AE or a suspected adverse reaction is cons idered “serious” if it results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
 Death 
 A life-threatening AE (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe) 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171762] 24-hours or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171763], based upon appropr iate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may requi re medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Exam ples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an  emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191], or development of drug dependency or drug

Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathoge nic, is considered an infectious agent.   
It is important to distinguish between “ser ious” and “severe” AE, as the terms are not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  Seriousne ss serves as the guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is  based on patient/event outcome 
or action usually associated with events that pose a threat to a pa tient’s life or vital functions.  
For example, nausea which persists for several h ours may be considered severe nausea, but may 
not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be cons idered an SAE.  Severity and 
seriousness should be independent ly assessed when recording AEs on the eCRF and SAEs on the 
SAE Report Form. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_201569] (AESIs) are a subset of AEs that are to be reported to 
Millennium on a quarterly basis by [CONTACT_456]-inv estigator. Millennium will provide the current

relationship between the drug and the AE.  A susp ected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality th an adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a 
drug. 
11.1.7  Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events 
Recording of Adverse Events 
All AEs of any patient during the course of the re search study will be recorded in the eCRF, and 
the Investigator will give his or  her opi[INVESTIGATOR_171764] (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to study drug administration). 
All AEs should be documented.  A description of the event, including it s date of onset and 
resolution, whether it constitutes an SAE or  not, any action taken (e.g., changes to study 
treatment), and outcome, should be provided, al ong with the Investig ator’s assessment of 
causality (i.e., the relationship to  the study treatment[s]).  For an AE to be a suspected treatment-
related event there should be at least a reasonable possi bility of a causal relationship between the 
protocol treatment and the AE.  Adverse even ts will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE 
v4.0, and changes will be documented. 
If the AE is serious, it should be  reported immediately to SCRI Innovations Safety Department.  
Other untoward events occurring in  the framework of a clinical st udy are to be recorded as AEs

mandated intervention, including inva sive procedures such as bi opsies, medication washout, or 
no treatment run-in). 
Any clinically significant signs  and symptoms; abnormal test findings; changes in physical 
examination; hypersensitivity; and other measuremen ts that occur will be reported as an AE, and 
collected on the relevant eCRF screen. 
Test findings will be reported as  an AE if: the test result requires an adjustment in the study 
drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment, and/ or te st findings require additi onal testing or surgical 
intervention, a test result or finding is associated  with accompanying symptoms, or a test result is 
considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_737]. 
Reporting Period for Adverse Events 
All AEs regardless of seriousness or re lationship to MLN9708 treatment (called study 
treatment), spanning from the start of st udy treatment, until 30 calendar days after 
discontinuation or completion of study treatment as defined by [CONTACT_64373], 
are to be recorded on the correspond ing screen(s) included in the eCRF. 
All AEs resulting in discontinuation from the study should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.  All new AEs occurring during this period must be reported and followed until 
resolution unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_125362], the AE or laborator y abnormality/ies are not 
likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the Investigators must record 
his or her reasoning for this decision in the pa tient’s medical record and as a comment on the 
eCRF screen. 
After [ADDRESS_201571], or other means will be 
reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and 
end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspec ted relationship to the study drug 
(see following guidance), and actions taken.  For se rious pretreatment events, the investigator 
must determine both the intensity of the event and the relationship of the event to study 
procedures. 
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causal ity assessments, Investigators should apply the 
following general guideline: 
YES:  There is a plausible temporal relations hip between the onset of the AE and 
administration of the study medication, and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_4677]’s clinical state, intercurrent illne ss, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and/or the AE 
follows a known pattern of response to the st udy drug, and/or the AE abates or resolves 
upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears 
upon re-challenge.

recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or 
syndrome should be named rather than each indivi dual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of 
signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a si ngle diagnosis or syndrome at 
the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate 
on the relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/ or AE eCRF screen).  If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, it shoul d be reported as follow-up info rmation is available.  If a 
diagnosis is determined subsequent to the re porting of the constellation of symptoms, the

subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be  recorded on an SAE Report Form and/or AE 
eCRF screen. 
11.3.3  Abnormal Laboratory Values 
If an abnormal laboratory value or  vital sign is associat ed with clinical signs and/or symptoms, 
the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE or SAE, and the associated laboratory value or 
vital sign should be considered additional information that must  be collected on the relevant 
eCRF screen.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis 
needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE eCRF screen. 
Abnormal laboratory values will be reported as an AE if: the laboratory result requires an 
adjustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuatio n of treatment, and/ or laboratory findings 
require additional testing or surgi cal intervention, a laboratory result or finding is associated with 
accompanying symptoms, or a laboratory result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_737].

Page 61 of 86  An event(s) is not consistent with the Ge neral Investigative Plan or in the current 
application 
 Includes AEs or Suspected Adverse Reacti ons that may be anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the study drug, or that occur with members of the drug 
class, but that have previously been observed unde r investigation 
When applicable, an unexpected AE may also apply to  an event that is not listed in the current IB 
or an event that may be mentioned in the IB, but differs from the event because of greater 
severity or specificity. 
Known as Suspected Unexpected Serious Advers e Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R), these events suspected 
(by [CONTACT_9304]) to be related to  the study drug, are unexpect ed (not listed in the 
IB), and are serious (as define d by [CONTACT_760]) and require e xpedient submission to relevant 
health authorities within 7 days (f atal or life-threatening event) or 15 days (all serious events), or 
as defined by [CONTACT_2371].  The term S[LOCATION_003]R is used pr imarily in the reporting of events to regulatory 
authorities. 
Expected AEs are those events that are li sted or characterized in the current IB.

to the patients and documentation evidencing the Principal Investigator’s  qualifications should 
be submitted to the IRB for ethical review and a pproval if required by [CONTACT_427], prior to 
the study start. 
The Principal Investigator/Sponsor and/or desi gnee will follow all necessary regulations to 
ensure appropriate, initial, and on-going, IRB st udy review.  The Principa l Investigator/Sponsor 
(as appropriate) must submit and, where nece ssary, obtain approval from the IRB for all 
subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the informed c onsent document.  Investigators 
will be advised by [CONTACT_171808]-substantial and whether it requires submissi on for approval or notific ation only to an IRB. 
Safety updates for MLN9708, will be prepared by [CONTACT_171809], 
for distribution to the Investigator(s) and submission to the relevant IRB. 
12.2 Regulatory Approval 
As required by [CONTACT_427], the Sponsor will ensure all le gal aspects are covered, and 
approval of the appropriate regu latory bodies obtained, prior to study initiation.  If required, the 
Sponsor will also ensure that the implementation of substantial amendments to the protocol and 
other relevant study documents happen only after a pproval by [CONTACT_64379]. 
12.3 Informed Consent 
Informed consent is a process by [CONTACT_9444] a patient  voluntarily confirms hi s or her willingness to 
participate in a particular study after having been informed of a ll aspects of the study that are 
relevant to the patient's decision to participate.   Informed consent is documented by [CONTACT_3553] a 
written, signed, and dated ICF. 
The ICF will be submitted for approval to the IRB that is responsible for review and approval of 
the study.  Each consent form must include all of  the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_1556], as well as local county authority or state regulations and national requirements. 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the study, each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the research study.  Once the e ssential information has been provided to the 
prospective candidate, and the Inve stigator is sure that the indi vidual candidate understands the 
implications of participating in th is research study, the candidate wi ll be asked to give consent to 
participate in the study by [CONTACT_8753].  A no tation that written informed consent has been 
obtained will be made in the patient’s medical reco rd.  A copy of the ICF, to include the patient’s 
signature, will be provided by [CONTACT_171810]. 
If an amendment to the protocol substantially alte rs the study design or th e potential risks to the 
patients, the patient’s consent to continue participation in the st udy should be obtained.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient Confidentiality 
Confidentiality of patient’s personal data will  be protected in accordance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Account ability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  HI PAA regulations require that, 
in order to participate in the st udy, a patient must sign an authoriza tion form for the study that he 
or she has been informed of following: 
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 That health information may be further disclo sed by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_64343], and 
that if the information is di sclosed the information may no longer be protected by [CONTACT_64380] 
 The information collected about the research study will be kept separate from the 
patient’s medical records, but the patient will be  able to obtain the research records after 
the conclusion of the study 
 Whether the authorization c ontains an expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] 
 The rights of a research patient to  revoke his or her authorization 
In the event that a patien t revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the Investigator, 
by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to  use all information collected pr ior to the revocation of patient 
authorization.  For patients that have revoked authorizati on to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vita l status (i.e., that the patient is alive) at the 
end of their scheduled study period. 
In compliance with ICH GCP guidelines and appli cable parts of [ADDRESS_201584] access to review th e patient’s original medical 
records at the site for verification of  study-related proce dures and data.  
Measures to protect confidentiality include: only a unique study number and initials will identify 
patients in the eCRF or other documents submitted  to the Sponsor.  This information, together 
with the patient’s date of birth, will be used in  the database for patient identification.  Patient 
names or addresses will not be entered in the e CRF.  No material bearin g a patient’s name [CONTACT_64402] [CONTACT_2728].  Patients will be  informed of their rights within the ICF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Investigator and Staff Information

It is not known what effects MLN9708 has on human pregnancy or development of the 
embryo or fetus.  Therefore, female patients participating in this study should avoid becoming 
pregnant, and male patients should avoid impregna ting a female partner.  Nonsterilized female 
patients of reproductive age group and male patients should use effective methods of 
contraception through defined periods during an d after study treatment as specified below. 
Female patients must meet 1 of the following criteria:  
 Postmenopausal for at least 1 year  before the screening visit, OR  
 Surgically sterile, OR 
 If they are of childbearin g potential, agree to practic e [ADDRESS_201612] dose of study drug, AND 
 Must also adhere to the guidelines of any treatment-specific pregnancy prevention 
program, if applicable, OR  
 Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with th e preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject.  (P eriodic abstinence [e.g., calenda r, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) 
Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e ., status postvasectomy), must agree to 1 of the 
following: 
 Agree to practice effective barrier contraception duri ng the entire study treatment 
period and through [ADDRESS_201613] dose of study drug, OR

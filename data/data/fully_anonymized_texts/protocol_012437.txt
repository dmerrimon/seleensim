PROTOCOL ABSTRACT  
There is a need for novel approaches to optimize smoking cessation treatment to help more smokers quit. Sleep 
disturbance during nicotine wi thdrawal may be an important treatment target since existing treatments do not 
mitigate withdrawal -related sleep disturbance and difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_485873]. We hypothesize 
that the FDA -approved melatonin receptor agonist, ramelteon, combi ned with transdermal nicotine replacement 
therapy (TN), will promote abstinence by [CONTACT_204012] -related sleep disturbance.  Using a well -validated 
medication screening paradigm, w e propose a within -subject, placebo -controlled crossover design with  one 
within -subjects factor of medication (ramelteon vs. placebo). Treatment -seeking smokers (n= 50) will complete this 
6-week study (two 2 -week phases separated by a 2 -week washout). Each phase includes 1 week of ad libitum  
smoking (baseline) and 1 week of medication (8mg ramelteon or placebo) plus TN while trying to abstain (quit 
assessment). Small monetary incentives will be provided for biochemically -confirmed abstinence. Subjects will 
keep daily sleep diaries and wear an  armband while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_485874] 
(SensewearPro®). The primary outcome will be the number of biochemically -confirmed days abstinent (out of 
five). Intermediate outcomes include sleep onset latency (self -report) and sleep eff iciency (SensewearPro® 
armband).  These data will lay the foundation for a larger Phase IIb clinical trial.

page 2 of 29 IRB APPLICATION  Template Version: 23 April 2010  
a. Sleep disturbance measures (sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency) with ramelteon treatment vs. placebo.  
b. Predict ing the ability to remain abstinent during the [ADDRESS_624174] preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, there are currently only three FDA -
approved medications for nicot ine dependence: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; transdermal nicotine (TN), 
nasal spray, gum, lozenge), bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and varenicline. Although TN doubles the odds of smoking cessation 
compared to placebo, the majority relapse within the first week [1, 2]. Importantly, we demonstrated that each 
additional day of abstinence during the first week nearly doubles the odds of success at end -of-treatment [3]. 
There is a clear need to identify novel approache s to optimize treatment to help more smokers maintain 
abstinence during this critical period. The development of a clinically valid model  for early human screening of 
medications to treat nicotine dependence [4-6], coupled wit h an emphasis on “repurposing” existing medications, 
provides a practical approach to achieve this aim [7, 8]. These models can also be used to assess novel smoking 
cessation treatment targets, such  as sleep disturbance.  
Sleep Disturbance is a Treatment Target . Converging lines of evidence suggest that remediating sleep 
disturbance may be a novel therapeutic target as an adjunct treatment for nicotine dependence. First, nicotine 
withdrawal is associated with sleep disturbance, such as difficulty falling asleep an d increased number of 
awakenings [9-11]. Second, existing nicotine dependence treatments do not mitigate sleep problems during a quit 
attempt; in fact, we and others have shown that TN [12-15] and varenicline [16] may exacerbate the problem. 
Third, sleep disturbance predicts smoking relapse in clinical trials and laboratory models of relapse [17-19]. Our 
preliminary data demonstrate that smoke rs who report longer sleep onset latency and wake more often are 
abstinent for fewer days using a model of short -term abstinence.   
Medications to Improve Sleep as a Smoking Cessation Treatment . Pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_485876]. However, FDA -approved medications for insomnia  
including  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (e.g., zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] /Ambien ®) and hypnotics (e.g., eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123]/Lunesta®, 
zaleplon/Sonata® ) may produce next -day residual effects, such as memory impairment , difficulty concentrating, 
or mood symptoms [20], that may promote smoking relapse [21, 22]. The FDA-approved melatonin receptor 
agonist, ramelteon (Rozerem ®; RAM)  does not produce next -day residual effects, has a low abuse potential, is 
not classified as a controlled substance, and is safe to use with TN [23]. Critically, RAM is indicated for improving 
sleep onset latency  (SOL) , which is commonly reported among smokers [9, 24] and associated with abstinence  in 
a model of short -term abstinence. We hypothesize that RAM, combined with TN, will promote smoking cessation 
by [CONTACT_485898] -related sleep disturbance.  
 
Using  a well -validated medication screening paradigm [4-6], we propose a within -subject, placebo -controlled 
crossover design with one within -subjects factor of short -term medication (ramelteon vs. placebo). Treatment -
seekin g smokers (n= 50) will complete this 6 -week study, which consists of two 2 -week phases separated by a 2 -
week washout. Each phase includes 1 week of ad libitum  smoking (baseline) and 1 week of medication (8mg 
ramelteon or placebo) plus TN while trying to abs tain (quit assessment). For the duration of the study, subjects 
will be asked to keep sleep diaries and to wear an armband while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], which provides objective indices of 
sleep duration and quality (SensewearPro®). Subjects will receive standard TN fol lowing completion of the study. 
The primary outcome  will be the total number of days abstinent (out of 5) , a measure that is highly predictive of 
longer -term quit success [3]. Intermediate outcomes  include sleep onset latency (se lf-report) and sleep efficiency 
(SensewearPro®).

Educationally or economically disadvantaged persons or cognitively impaired persons will be not be targeted for 
recruitment ; however , they may be included in the current stud y. Because recruitment efforts for this study will be 
targeted to the greater Philadelphia area, University of Pennsylvania employees and students, and UPHS faculty 
and staff may be exposed to these advertisements and choose to respond. These individuals a re eligible to 
participate if they meet all inclusion criteria. Status of participation in the current study will be independent of the 
participant’s work or school activities . 
 
7.  Subject Recruitment  
Participants will be recruited from two sources.  Participants who  have previously completed studies at our center 
and have agreed to be re -contact[CONTACT_485902]. 
Additional recruitment via  TV, newspaper, radio, poster, and internet -based  advertising ( e.g., in-app ads, 
Craigslist,  and iConnect ) will be used to invite smokers from the general population.

2. Design  
We propose to conduct a randomized, placebo -controlled, cross -over design with one within -subjects factor of 
medication (RAM vs. PLA; order counterbalanced). Each phase includes: 1 week of ad libitum  smoking (baseline) 
and 1 week of medication (8mg RAM  or PLA) plus TN while trying to abstain (quit assessment)  (Figure 1).  
 
3. Study Duration  
Estimated length of time to enroll all subjects and complete the study  
Enrollment will start in October  2015 (after IRB approval is received).  We estimate that we will need to telephone 
screen 1500 smokers to enroll  (consent)  150 smokers into the study (accounting for 10% eligibility). Using a 
conservative estimate of attrition (50%), we expect to have [ADDRESS_624181]’s participation time in study  
We estimate it will take a minimum  of [ADDRESS_624182]  2018 .

DRUGS OR DEVICES  
Ramelteon  
The study will be performed using 8mg of ramelt eon, which is currently marketed for the treatment of sleep 
problems .  
 
The proposed study follows the typi[INVESTIGATOR_485878] (8mg once a day), which is documented to be 
safe and well -tolerated [27-29]. Ramelteon  will be purchased and packaged into blister packs by [CONTACT_485903]. In accordance with FDA recommendations, 
subjects will be instructed to take study medication wit hin 30 min prior to going to bed and avoid taking study 
medication with or immediately after a high fat meal.  
 
An IND exemption has been approved for this study  for ramelteon  and TN as the results will not be reported to the 
FDA to support a new drug indication . 
 
Supply, Preparation, Storage, Packaging and Dispensing of Study Medication  
Ramelteon  will be purchased and supplied via the University of Pennsylvania Investigational Drug Service (IDS 
number pending ). Matched placebo will be made in -house usi ng sucrose filler in gel capsules. The IDS will store 
the medication as p er the manufacturer guidelines. Specifically, medication will be stored at room temperature (20 
– 25 degrees centigrade) and in airtight containers. Ramelteon  and the matching placebo  will be packaged in 
blister packs .  IDS will oversee the labeling of all study medication, and will assign each kit, which contains 
medication for one subject, a unique Pharmacy Randomization Number (PRN).  
 
Kits will be ordered as needed by [CONTACT_53775] s taff and stored in a locked cabinet at our center. Once the Study 
Physician ([CONTACT_484489] ) signs the prescription and a subject is assigned a treatment order (ramelteon first or 
placebo first), medication kits will be ordered and pi[INVESTIGATOR_485879] a membe r of the research staff. Once a 
new subject is enrolled and eligible, the research staff will assign the subject the next available PRN. Blister packs 
will then be labeled with the subject’s study ID number.  Each medication kit will consist of 6 days of 8m g 
ramelteon and 6  days of placebo  (one for each quit assessment day plus an extra) . The PRN and study ID 
number must match for each blister pack a subject receives.  Medication will be stored at CIRNA as per 
manufacturer’s guidelines.  
 
Regular study drug reconciliation will be performed to document drug assigned, drug consumed, and drug 
remaining. This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, and signed by [CONTACT_485904].  
 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of drug shipped, drug consumed, and drug 
remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated by [CONTACT_237766]. Any discrepancies noted will be investigated , resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction of 
unused study drug.  Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study files.  
 
Transdermal Nicotine  
Subjects  will receive the 21 mg dose during each quit -assessment week . The patch will be Ni coderm CQ as used 
in our previous clinical trials [30, 31]. Subjects will be given the patches at the last visit during each Baseline week 
(weeks 1 and 5) and instructed to begin using the patches the morning of the TQD during each study period 
(Figure 1 ). Because wearing nicotine patche s at night may cause sleep disturbance (i.e., vivid dreams) [32-34]), 
subjects  will be instructed to remove the patch before going to sle ep. Following completion of the study, we will 
offer all subjects open -label cessation treatment with TN to attract participation by [CONTACT_485905].  
 
All patches will be purchased from a University of Pennsylvania approved vendor  (GlaxoSmithKline) . Upon 
receipt, an inventory will be performed and a drug receipt log will be completed and signed by [CONTACT_116618]. Study staff will count and verify that the shipment contains all the items noted in the 
shipment invento ry. To ensure patch inventory is kept up to date, an on -going inventory will also be performed as 
         University of Pennsylvania    Institutional Review Board  
 
page 7 of 29 IRB APPLICATION  Template Version: 23 April 2010  
patches are distributed. Patches will be stored in a double locked location (i.e., in a locked cabinet in a locked 
room) at room temperature.  
 
SUICIDAL IDEATI ON AND BEHAVIOR  
The C -SSRS will be administered at the Intake visit by a trained member of the staff. Individuals who endorse 
current (past month) suicidal ideation or lifetime suicidal behavior will be ineligible to participate. Because these 
assessments may cause an adverse emotional reaction, staff will be trained to deal with such reactions and to 
provide additional referrals if needed. If necessary, referrals to appropriate psychological services will be 
provided.   
 
STUDY PROCEDURES  
1.  Procedures  
This is a randomized placebo -controlled study  of the effects of ramelt eon, compared to placebo,  on ability to quit 
smoking. Participants will complete a n Intake  at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research  on Nicotine Addiction 
(CIRNA) before being enrolle d into the study. All study visits will be completed at the CIRNA. P articipants will 
complete two 2 -week phases separated by a two -week washout period. Each phase will involve one week of ad 
libitum  smoking (Baseline) and one week of medication (RAM vs. PL A) as well as TN treatment while trying to 
abstain (Quit Assessment). Each Baseline week, subjects will attend a brief visit on Monday, Wednesday, and 
Friday to assess smoking rate, blood pressure, CO and BrAC samples, side effects, withdrawal, craving, an d 
affect. Subjects ’ sleep diaries will be collected and the SensewearPro® data will be downloaded to confirm 
compliance.  During the quit assessment weeks, subjects will take the assigned study medication on each 
weekday and urine samples will be collected to confirm compliance. They will be asked to try their best to abstain 
from smoking will receive $ 10/day for each day that self -reported abstinence is biochemically -confirmed 
(CO<5ppm). They will complete 20 -min visits on each weekday to verify abstinence and complete measures.  
 
2. Study Visits  
 Telephone Screening . Individuals interested in participating will be screened by [CONTACT_485906]. If the subject meets preliminary phone eligibility and is interested 
in participating, he/she will be invited to attend a 2.5-hour Intake  visit. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_485907], text message, e-mail, and/or postal mail to remind them about their scheduled intake visit date and time. 
Method of preference will be collected over the phone.

If a participant is ineligible due to any of the above criteria during the Intake , he/she will only be 
compensated $10 for  travel.  However, if a participant tests positive for study prohibited drugs, he/she will 
not receive any compensation.  
 
Otherwise, if a participant meets the above eligibility criteria at the Intake , he/she  will be asked to complete 
the following:  
 
12. Compl ete questionnaires (demographics, nicotine dependence, smoking rate, withdrawal, and 
smoking urges)  
13. Receive instructions on how to  record  their daily sleep diaries  and report  their sleep and wake times  
14. Be randomized to receive RA M or PLA during the first phase  
15. Finalize their study schedule

to take prescription medications not in the exclusion list) throughout their participation in the study. Femal e 
participants will also be asked to use an approved method of contraception through the study.  
 
 Final Eligibility Phone Call  (only for individuals with a history of jaundice/liver disease) . When liver function 
tests have been reviewed and authorized by [CONTACT_38234], a study staff member will call the subjects to 
inform them of their final eligibility.  
 
Final Eligibility is defined as:  Liver function test results and GGT liver enzyme levels that are no more than 
20% outside the normal, clinical range.  Albumin/Globulin ratios 20% outside of normal range will be evaluated 
for clinical significance by [CONTACT_485908] a case -by-case basis.  
 
Ineligible subjects may be referred to other studies at our center.  Eligible subjects  will schedule all other study 
visits  and be randomized to receive RAM or PLA during the first phase . During the first study visit, participants 
will receiv e instructions on how to use the SensewearPro® and record their daily sleep diaries.   
 
 Baseline Weeks (Weeks 1 and 5) . Participants will complete three  observation visits  during the Baseline 
weeks on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  The visits on Monday and Wednesday will last approximately [ADDRESS_624184] phase . At the observation visits  participants will:  
 
1. Arrive at CIRNA and provide a CO and BrAC sample (Participants must  have  BrAC readings less than 
0.01 in order to be eligible for the study).  
2. Provide a blood pressure  sample (See Blood Pressure Procedures  under Screening/covariate 
measures) . 
3. Complete questionnaires (smoking rate, concomitant medication review, sleep, withdrawal, smoking 
urges, mood, and side effects) . 
4. Have sleep diaries collected and data stored on armband downloaded by [CONTACT_485909]. 
Research staff will review adheren ce. 
 
At the first (Monday) visit of Baseline Week 1  and 5 , the participant will receive his or her SensewearPro®  
armband . At Baseline Week 1, the participant will receive an instructional packet and a research staff 
member will review how to use the armband and charger correctly . 
 
The third (Friday) visit of each Baseline Week  will last approximately 40 minutes. During this visit, subjects 
will: 
1. Provide urine specimens for drug and (if applicable) pregnancy tests  (Friday visit only) .  Participants 
who test positive for either the urine drug screen and/or pregnancy test will be withdrawn from the 
study .

page 9 of 29 IRB APPLICATION  Template Version: 23 April 2010  
2. Meet with a smoking cessation counselor for a 20 -min coaching session to prepare them for the 
practice quit attempt. The counselor wi ll review copi[INVESTIGATOR_485880].  
3. Participants will receive their study medication and nicotine patches. Study staff will review instructions 
for taking the study medication and applying the nicotine patches.  
 
These session s can be scheduled for any time of day . Ideally, t he subsequent session s would be at the 
same time of day , but can be scheduled up to 3 hours earlier or later. However, the sessions may go 
beyond 3 hours as determined by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_9106].  
 
 Quit Assessment Weeks (Weeks 2 and 6) . Participants will attend a 20 minute study visit every weekday of 
their quit assessment week. They will be asked to bring their study medication to this visit to verify medication 
adherence/pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685] . During this session , which will last approximately 20 minutes , participants will complete 
measures of : 
1. Blood pressure  (See Blood Pressure Procedures  under Screening/covariate measures)  
2. CO breath  sample  
a. To increase abstinence motivation, participants will receive $ 10/day (in cash) for each day for 
self-reported abstinence that is biochemically -confirmed . On Monday, a  CO reading of less 
than 10ppm or less than 50% of CO breath sample taken during the Baseline week will be 
sufficient as biochemically -confirmed abstinence. At all  other visits, a  CO reading less than 5 
ppm will be considered as biochemically -confirmed abstinence.  
3. BrAC sample  
4. Smoking rate  (timeline followback; TLFB)   
5. Medication adherence ( pi[INVESTIGATOR_692] )  
6. Side effects  and concomitant medication review  
a. If moderate to severe adverse events are reported, the PI/Study Physician will be consulted 
and a decision will be made as to whether to proceed with the study.  
7. Mood, smoking urges, withdrawal symptoms , sleep measures   
 
At the last visit of the first Quit Assessment Week (Week 2), the SensewearPro®  armband and charger 
will be collected from the participant, as he or she will not be using the SensewearPro ® armband during 
the washout period. If the participant continues the  study, the participant will receive the SensewearPro®  
armband at their first visit of the second Baseline Week (Week 5).  
 
These sessions can be scheduled for any time of day. Ideally, the subsequent sessions would be at the 
same time of day, but can be sc heduled up to 3 hours earlier or later. However, the sessions may go 
beyond 3 hours as determined by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_9106].  
 
At the final visit of the study, p articipants will be offered information (i.e. flyer, brochure, etc.) about a 
smoking cessation research program at the CIRNA . If no cessation studies are available or the participant 
does not wish to participate, t hey will be provided a list of referrals to other cessation programs  in the 
greater Philadelphia area  (e.g., the Comprehensive Smoking Treatment P rogram at UPenn Presby[CONTACT_194840]) . 
The participant’s decision whether or not to receive this information will be documented.  Participants will 
return the SensewearPro armband  and will be given a summary report of their physical activity and sleep 
patterns.  
 
 Washout Weeks (Weeks 3 and 4):  During these two weeks, participants will not have any study visits or take 
any study med ication. They will be instructed to smoke ad libitum . Subjects who abstain during week [ADDRESS_624185] few subjects to discontinue the study for this 
reason [4, 35, 36].

3. Description of Measures and Variables    
 
3.1 Screening /Covariate  Measures  
Demographics and Smoking History . Standard questionnaires will be self -administered at the Intake  visit to collect 
the following data: demographics (age, gender, m arital status, education), age at smoking initiation, cigarette brand, 
length of prior abstinence periods and current smoking rate.  The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) 
will also be administered.  The FTND is a 6 -item, self -report measure of  nicotine dependence derived from the 
Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire [37].  The FTND scale has satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's 
alpha=. 64) and high test -retest reliability (r=. 88) [38]. 
 
Medical History . A medical history (self-report) and a physical examination will be conducted at the Intake  visit to 
review for any contraindications listed previously. The medical history  (including height and weight) will be 
completed by a research staff member .  
 
Psychiatric History . Current major depression, lifetime prevalence of psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, 
hypomanic/manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and substance abuse will be determined via self -report during the phone screen and 
via semi -structured interview using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inter view (MINI). The MINI is a 10 -15 
minute structured interview developed by [CONTACT_329026] -IV Axis 1 
psychiatric diagnoses. This instrument permits both current (past 30 days) and lifetime assessments of psychiatric 
illness , and recent data support its reliability and validity [39]. The MINI will be administered by a trained research 
staff member  at the Intake  visit. Ther e will be 100% review of paper MINIs by [INVESTIGATOR_124] . Hole, a clinical psychologist with 
relevant training,  to maintain quality control.  
 
Suicid al Behavior and Ideation  (C-SSRS) . All participants will complete the C -SSRS (Screening Version) with a 
trained staff member at the Intake Visit. The C -SSRS is a structured interview that assesses the suicidal behavior 
and suicidal ideation in subjects [40, 41]. Occurrence of lifetime  suicidal behavior is defined as having answered 
“yes” to at least 1 of the 4 suicidal behavior sub -catego ries (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, 
and preparatory acts or behavior). Current suicidal ideation is defined as having answered “yes” to at least 1 of 
the suicidal ideation sub -categories (wish to be dead, non -specific active suicida l thoughts, active suicidal ideation 
with any methods without intent to act, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act [without specific plan], and 
active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) over the past month .

  Urine Drug  Screen . The urine drug screen will be administered at Intake and the last visit of each baseline week 
(Friday of weeks 1 and 5) .  The urine drug screen requires about [ADDRESS_624186]  
has recently  taken any exclusionary  drugs  (marijuana, cocaine, PCP, amphetamines, methamphetamines, 
tricyclic antidepressants, ecstasy, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], methadone, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and barbiturates).  Participants with a 
positive urine drug screen for any substance listed above will be deemed inelig ible. In an effort to remain CLIA -
compliant, results from urine drug screening will not be shared with participants. Participants will be informed that 
the testing is for research purposes only and that they will be informed of their eligibility status, bu t not of the 
specific testing results.   
 
Urine Pregnancy Test . At the Intake and the last visit of each baseline week ( Friday of weeks 1 and 5), 
participants will be supplied with a simple, CLIA -waived urine pregnancy screen and informed that pregnant 
wome n are not advised to participate in this research study. Participants will then be instructed to administer the 
pregnancy test independently and will inform study staff if they would like to continue participation after they have 
administered the pregnancy  screen. Participants will be informed that there is no penalty for discontinuing 
participation at this point in the visit and that they will still receive travel reimbursement for the visit.  
 
Breath Alcohol Concentration .  The breath alcohol  concentration  (BrAC)  assessment will be administered at the 
Intake  visit and all subsequent study visits. The breath alcohol monitor assesses expi[INVESTIGATOR_485882]. A reading greater than or equal to 0.[ADDRESS_624187] 14 
hours  and will result in the participant being withdrawn from the study .  
 
         University of Pennsylvania    Institutional Review Board  
 
page 12 of 29 IRB APPLICATION  Template Version: 23 April 2010  
Blood Pressure .  At the Intake , participants presenting with elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure 
great er than 159 and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than 99) will have a second blood pressure reading taken 
after a ten minute period in which the participants will be instructed to sit comfortably.  If, after the second reading 
the SBP is greater than 159 mmHg and/o r the DBP is greater than [ADDRESS_624188] reading the SBP is 
greater than 159 mmHg and/or the DBP is greater than 99 mmHg, the i ndividual will be ineligible to participate . 
 
Blood pressure will be measured at all subsequent in -person visits.   If participants present with elevated blood 
pressure (i.e., s ystolic blood pressure greater than 159 mmHg  and/or d iastolic blood pressure greater than 99 
mmHg ) at any subsequent visit , the staff will follow the same steps listed above.  If, after a third  reading , systolic 
blood pressure remains greater than 159 mmHg  and/or dia stolic remains greater than [ADDRESS_624189] will 
be told to not take the next dose of study medication. If a participant presents with a SBP between 151 -159 
mmHg and/or DBP between [ADDRESS_624190] mild, Stage I, hypertension and advise they consult with a physician. The 
participant will remain eligible for the study and receive nicotine patches as scheduled.  The research staff will 
notify the Study Physician /Health Care Provider  who will review the blood pressure reading and determine 
whether it is safe for the subject to continue. Research staff will follow up with the participant accordingly.  
 
Liver Function Tests and Gamma -glutamyl Transpepsidase . Only individuals with a history of jaundice/liver 
disease will provide a blood sample for liver function tests. One 8.5ml blood sample will be drawn at the Intake 
visit to conduct liver function tests.  Blood will be collected and placed in a serum -separat or tube (SST)  and mixed 
thoroughly.  Samples will be centrifuged at 30 00 rpm for 15  minutes .  The following chemistry will be assessed:  
1. Total protein.  
2. Albumin.  
3. Globulin.  
4. Albumin:Globulin ratio.  
5. Bilirubin (total, conjugated and unconjugated)  
6. Aspartate amino transferase (AST).  
7. Alanine amino transferase (ALT).  
8. Alkaline phosphatase (AP).  
9. Gamma glutamyl transferase (Gamma -GT). 
 
Brief counseling . These 20 -minute sessions will occur during the final visit of each Baseline week (Friday). This 
counseling session will be similar to previous studies in our center (IRB#815789). Specifically, a trained smoking 
cessation counselor will review reasons for smoking and common withdrawal symptoms. Counselors will work 
with participants to develop plans to manage triggers, avoid cigarettes, and gather social support. Participants will 
also be taught a breathing relaxation technique for handling stressful situat ions.  
 
3.2 Treatment Variables  
 
Concomitant Medication Review .  Subjects  will be asked about their use of medications (over the counter and 
prescription) and substances that may alter subjects ’ response to the study medication.  The Study 
Physician /Health Care Provider  will advise as to whether other medications being taken are contraindicated and 
prescribe appropriate action from there (i.e., discontinuation of the study medication). The concomitant medication 
review will be completed at every study visit  following the Intake . 
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_38950]/Adherence . Medication adherence will be assessed  by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_485883] [42]. We will assess patch use by [CONTACT_4317]’ self -report and collect unused patches at the end of the 
week.  
 
Side Effects . A checklis t of side effects based on the product insert will be administered to participants at all study 
visits  after the Intake . The frequency  and severity of common side effects of RAM [43] and TN [30, 44] will be 
rated on a 0 (none) to 3 (severe) scale. An open -ended side effects question will also be included.  Furthermore, 
         University of Pennsylvania    Institutional Review Board  
 
page 13 of 29 IRB APPLICATION  Template Version: 23 April 2010  
participants will receive written instructions to call the Health Care Provider/Study Physician  should they experience 
any severe side effects or adverse events between study visits.    
 
3.3 Intermediate Outcomes  
 
Subjective Sleep Measures : As in [CONTACT_485917]’ prior work, subjects  will complete sleep diaries  daily within 1h of 
getting out of bed  and prior to going to sleep and will  provide t ime-stamped phone records for time to bed and 
time awake  [45-48]. These well -validated sleep diaries assess subjective SOL, total sleep time, number of 
awakenings and perceived quality of sleep. The diaries  will be used to verify  the sleep parameters derived from 
the Sensew earPro® armbands [49, 50]. 
The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]  (PSQI)  is a [ADDRESS_624191] month . It measur es seven  areas: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual 
sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunct ion. Scoring is based on a 0 to 
3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme. A sum of “5” or greater indicates a “poor” sleeper [51]. The 
PSQI has good internal consistency ( α=0.83), validity, and reliability, and is sensitive to  treatment [52, 53]. The 
outcome is the global PSQI score  and will be evaluated as a moderator of RAM’s effects on abstinence.  
Sleep Efficiency (SensewearPro armbands) : A multi -method approach is necessary to capture different 
components of insomnia symptoms [54], such as self -report, polysomnography ( PSG ) or actigraphy [50]. 
Compared to PSG, actigraphy provides concordance rates between 80% and 95% for wake /sleep detection, 
enables data collection for weeks to months, and is less expensive [50, 55, 56]). The SensewearPro® armband s 
(BodyMedia, Inc. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA) measure body movement, like actigraphy, and acquire additional physiological 
signals, including surface body temperature, galvanic skin response, and heat flux [57]. The armbands provide 
89% concordance with PSG data and identif y sleep and wakefulness with moderate to high sensitivity and 
specificity [57]. Subjects will wear the armband during each phase (weeks 1, 2, 5, and 6), and  will be provided 
$4/day for each day they wear the armband and complete the sleep diary plus $[ADDRESS_624192] 18 of 22  
days of data (85%).  Subjects will be instructed to remove the armband only for bathing purposes or water activity. 
The data will be downloaded to the Sensewear Professional software ( v8.0; Bodymedia, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_402648], PA) at each 
visit to confirm compliance  using a  threshold of 90% on body time. Following PSG standards, the first and last 
nights will not be analyzed to allow for adaptation  [50, 55, 56]. The outcome is sleep efficiency.  Participa nts will 
not be responsible for lost or otherwise compromised armbands.  
 
Depression symptoms . The 20 -item Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_485884] (CESD) will assess 
depressive symptoms  [58, 59]. It has high internal consistency (α=0.85) and scores greater than 16 correlate with 
clinical ratings of depression [60]. Participants will rate the intensity of their symptoms in the past week on the 
following scale: 0 = rarely, or none of the time (less than once a day) , 1 = some, or a little of the time (1 -2 days) , 2 = 
occasionally, or a moderate amount of time (3 -4 days) , 3 = most, or all of the time (5 -7 days)  and a summary score 
will be calculated.  The CESD  will be adm inistered at the Intake and on the last visit of each Baseline and Quit 
Assessment week . 
 
Withdrawal Symptoms . The “Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale - Revised version”(MNWS_R) [61] captures 
the current state of nicotine withdrawal [62, 63]. The scale assesses  eight DSM -IV items of nicotine withdrawal 
including: dysphoria or depressed mood, insomnia, irritability/frustration/anger, anxiety, decreased heart rate, 
difficulty concentrating, restlessness, and increased appetite/weight gain.  Participants will rate the intensity of their 
symptoms on the following scale: 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and a summary score will 
be calculated. This will be administered at all study visits  (except the Intake ). Withdrawal will be assessed using a 
24-h time reference for all visits following the Intake .  
 
Craving . The 10 -item brief QSU questionnaire on smoking urges [64] will be used to assess craving for cigarettes 
during the medication run -up period .  The QSU -B contains 2 subscales (anticipation of reward, relief from 
negative affect).  Craving has also been related to long -term cessation outcome in many, but not all, clinical 
studies [65]. This will be administered at all study visits  (except the Intake ). Similar to withdrawal symptoms, craving 
will be assessed using a 24-h time reference at all visits following the Intake.   
 
         University of Pennsylvania    Institutional Review Board  
 
page 14 of 29 IRB APPLICATION  Template Version: 23 April 2010  
Mood: Positive and Negative  Affect .  The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) [66], a [ADDRESS_624193] (PA; 10 items, e.g., enthusiastic, strong) and 
Negative Affect (NA; 10 items, e.g., distressed, upset), two dominant and generally orthogonal dimensions of 
affect. PA and  NA (PANAS) will be assessed at all study visits  (except the Intake ). PA and NA will be assessed 
using a 24-h time reference for all visits following the Intake .  
 
3.4 Smoking Outcomes  
 
Smoking Rate (TLFB) .  We will assess the number of cigarettes smoked  on each day  throughout the study . A 
standard timeline follow -back (TLFB) method will be used [67], as we have done previously [68] to assess self -
reported smoking rate.  During each quit week, a bstinence  will be  assessed daily by [CONTACT_6270] -report of no smoking at  
all over the prior 24 hours and an expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] -air CO less than  5 ppm (except for the Monday visit when CO may be 
less than 10ppm or less than 50% Baseline CO) . This stringent biochemical criterion  for validating smoking 
cessation has been shown  to be more sensitive to detect smoking and specific to verify abstinence than h igher  
CO c ut-offs [69]. 
 
Carbon Monoxide .  Carbon monoxide (CO) measures will be made using a Vitalograph Breath CO Analyzer 
(McNeil International, Inc., Lenexa, KS).  The manufacturer will have calibrated this device within the past year.  A 
new, disposable cardboard mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_485885].  The device has a digital screen 
which reports CO levels in parts per million (ppm).  Participants will be asked to provide a CO breath  sample by 
[CONTACT_41680] a large breath then exhaling twice. Then, they will take  another deep breath and hold their breath for [ADDRESS_624194] sizes for power analyses were derived from prior work on TN effects on days of abstinence (Aim 1) [6], 
studies demonstrating RAM’s effects on sleep (Aim 2), and our preliminary data. All significance levels will be set 
at 0.05.  Our primary hypothesis is that RAM will increase the number of days abstinent (out of 5), compared to 
placebo. In prior validation work, the average number of days abstinent for TN was 2.0±0.3 [6]. Fifty subjects 
provide 80% power to detect a difference of 0.55 days between RAM and PLA, using a SD of 1.36 and a within -
subjects correlation of 0.78 [31].  
 
For Aim 2, meta -analyses indicate that RAM is associated with reducing SOL by 4.3 min and increasing sleep 
efficiency by 4.42% [70]. Our preliminary data suggest that TN increases sleep disturbance by 58% (d=0.28) in 
abstinent smokers and that abstinence increases SOL by ~5 min and decreases sleep efficiency by ~5%. Fifty  
subjects provide 80% power to detect differences of 6 min in SOL and 5% in sleep efficiency between RAM and 
PLA, using a within -subject correlation between 0.4 and 0.8. Thus, Aims 1 and 2 are sufficiently powered.  
 
Statistical Analysis .   
For Aim 1 (H1), a within -subject ANOVA will test the primary hypothesis for effects of RAM (vs. PLA) on number 
of days abstinent during the quit week.  
 
For Aim 2 (H2a), separate 2 drug (RAM vs. PLA) x 2 week (baseline vs. quit week) repeated measures ANOVAs 
will test the  effects of RAM on SOL and sleep efficiency. Drug and week are within -subject factors and sleep 
measures will be averaged across days within each baseline and quit week. We are primarily interested in the 
drug x week interaction to test whether RAM (vs. pl acebo) attenuates sleep disturbance during the quit week, 
relative to baseline . Thus, each period has its own baseline control comparison.  A supplemental analysis will 
include only days during the quit week when subjects are abstinent.  
 
For Aim H2b, linea r regression models will test whether sleep disturbance predicts number of days abstinent and 
         University of Pennsylvania    Institutional Review Board  
 
page 15 of 29 IRB APPLICATION  Template Version: 23 April 2010  
whether this relationship  varies by [CONTACT_3148]. Models will include covariates (e.g., baseline depression/anxiety, 
FTND, sex, and age). We will also examine correl ations between sleep disturbance data and nicotine withdrawal 
and depression/anxiety symptoms in both groups.  
 
3.  Confidentiality  
All participant information will be kept in a secure filing cabinet that is accessible only to authorize d study 
personnel.  A ll study databases containing participant information will be password protected, and accessible only 
to authorized study personnel.  Any study communications made by e -mail will use ID numbers and not include 
names or other personal information. All data sets will use ID numbers  only.  
 
How will confidentiality of data be maintained?  Check all that apply.  
 
 Paper -based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel involved in the 
study.  
 Computer -based files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through the use of access 
privileges and passwords.  
 Prior to access to any study -related information, CIRNA personnel will be required to sign statements agreeing 
to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable information.  
 Whenever feasible, identifiers will be removed from stud y-related information.  
 A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at risk of criminal 
or civil liability or cause damage t o the subject’s financial standing, employability, or liability.  
 A waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the subject and the 
study  would be the consent document and the primary risk is a breach of confidentiality.  (This is not an option for 
FDA-regulated research.)  
 Precautions are in place to ensure the  data is secure by [CONTACT_71994], because the 
research involves web -based surveys.   
 Audio and/or video recordings will be transcribed and then destroyed to el iminate audible identification of 
subjects.  
 Other (specify):     
 
All research personnel associated with this study have completed the CITI-Protection of Human Subjects 
Research Training  as well as HIPAA Compliance Training.  Trained staff will assess eligibility, introduce  the study 
rationale, procedures, study risks, and collect  combined  informed  consent / HIPAA authorization form.  
 
5. Privacy  
The following protected  health information will be collected as part of this study:  
 Name  
 Street address, city, county, zip code  
 Telephone numbers  
 Email  address  
 Date of birth  
 Medical and drug use histor y  Last 4 digits of Social Security Number  
 Results from all questionnaires, tests, or procedures  
 Data collected from SensewearPro armbands  
 Urine for drug screening/pregnancy test

6.  Tissue Specimens  
Urine . A urine sample  will be required at all sessions for the drug and  pregnancy screening . Participants who test 
positive for study prohibited drugs use will be deemed ineligible, as will women who have a positive pregnancy 
test. All female participants of child-bearing potential will complete urine pregnancy tests .  
 
Blood . (only for those with history of jaundice/liver disease) An 8.5ml sample of blood will be drawn at the Intake 
visit to evaluate liver function.  
 
RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
1.  Potential Study Risks  
Potential Risks of the Medication : The following are the common side effects that have been reported with 
ramelteon  treatment :  drowsiness, tiredness, dizziness , and nausea . All of these side effects have been mild and 
         University of Pennsylvania    Institutional Review Board  
 
page 16 of 29 IRB APPLICATION  Template Version: [ADDRESS_624195]  occurred in approximately 3% of subjects in clinical trials ([COMPANY_005] 
Pharmaceutical, 2005).  Side effects will be assessed at baseline of each period and each subsequent  visit (a 
total of 16 times throughout the study). The incidence of side effects is lower with the 8mg dose (as compared to 
the 16mg dose); which is the dose that has been selected in the proposed project.  
  
In addition to the side effects mentioned above,  other rare side effects of ramelteon have been reported : 
 
 Severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions  such as angioedema (swelling of the tongue  and larynx), 
difficulty swallowing, vomiting, and throat closing.  
 Abnormal thoughts  and behavioral change s such as hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, bizarre behavior, 
agitation and mania, amnesia, and anxiety  
 Complex behaviors such as "sleep -driving" and other behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making 
phone calls)  
 Hormone effects including decreased  testosterone and increased prolactin   
 
All of these side effects shall be queried using a side effects checklist as described above.  
 
Stringent exclusion criteria are in place to limit the chance of these side effects. Additionally, participants will be 
informed about these possible side effects and be made aware to watch for any of these symptoms and report 
them as soon as possible to the research staff. All subjects will be instructed to take the study medication [ADDRESS_624196] the study physician ([CONTACT_485918] ) and study PI ([CONTACT_329069]) immediately for appropriate intervention. The study physician’s emergency 
contact [CONTACT_485910], the study consent form, and a study brochure  all 
participants will be provided with once they enr oll into the study.  
 
Transdermal Nicotine (TN) Replacement Therapy : All participants will receive transdermal nicotine (TN) patch 
therapy to aid in quitting smoking. This therapy is available over the counter and is very well tolerated. 
Participants will use the [ADDRESS_624197] visit of e ach baseline week (week s 1 and 5 ), a member of the research staff will review the 
purpose of using the nicotine patch (e.g., to help manage withdrawal symptoms; not a substitute for behavioral 
quitting strategies), provide directions on how to use the patch (e.g., abstinence fro m smoking, patch location, 
time, activity, and potential skin reactions), and answer any questions.  
 
Because increased blood pressure is a side effect of TN patch therapy, blood pressure will be closely monitored 
at each visit. E xpanding the upper limit o f the blood pressure  to less than 160/100  does not increase the risk to 
subjects enrolled in this trial. The risk of increased blood pressure is no greater than the risk from smoking and 
quitting smoking will lower an individual’s risk.  If a participant pr esents with a SBP between 151 -159 mmHg 
and/or DBP  between [ADDRESS_624198] at each visit (in addition to those listed above for 
ramelteon). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_485886]. These will be communicated 
immediately to the study physic ian, [CONTACT_484489] . Participants will be instructed to promptly discontinue the patch 
and contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_485887] (e.g., severe redness, itching, or 
swelling) at the site of patch application or a generalized  skin reaction (e.g., raised patches, hives, or generalized 
rash). Any serious adverse reactions or significant side effects of TN will be medically evaluated by [CONTACT_7357]. Patch use by [CONTACT_329047]. B ased on our previous

experience with NRT studies [30, 31], we expect few serious adverse events. Nevertheless, the study physician, 
[CONTACT_484489] , will be available to assist with any adverse events and participant safety issues. Depending on the 
nature of the side effects, [CONTACT_484489]  may reduce the dose of the patch or recommend that the participant 
discontinue the patch.  
 
Pregnancy : In animal studies, ramelteon produced evidence of developmental toxicity, including teratogenic 
effects, in rats at doses much greater than the reco mmended human dose (RHD) of 8 mg/day. There are no 
adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women. T hus, ramelteon must not be used during pregnancy. 
All female participants of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the Inta ke session and 
prior to receiving study medication (Baseline Visit 3 of each medication period).  
 
Blood Draw : (only for individuals with a history of liver disease/jaundice) Blood draws  may result in bruising and/or 
slight bleeding at the needle site.  Thi s is rare and happens infrequently.  Occasionally, blood drawing results in a 
feeling of faintness.  This too is rare.  A trained professional will draw blood, so the chances of these discomforts 
are minimal.  
 
Confidentiality and Loss of Privacy : Protection of privacy of subjects in research studies is of utmost importance, 
particularly when health history information is collected. Information will never be recorded with identifiers other 
than study ID. A separate list of names with ID numbers will  be accessible only by [CONTACT_253977]. All 
records will be kept in locked filing cabinets to maintain confidentiality. Results will not be communicated to other 
personnel or to the subjects. All analyses will be conducted on de -identified data.  
 
Withdrawal : Many individuals who smoke cigarettes exhibit a pattern of symptoms associated with withdrawal 
from cigarette use. These symptoms can include: sadness and anxiety, irritability, difficulty concentrating, anger, 
appetite change and weight gain, inso mnia, and decreased heart rate. These events are generally of low risk. The 
study personnel will be trained to recognize these symptoms and educate the participants about them (e.g., their 
duration, methods for reducing them). TN will also help reduce with drawal symptoms.  
 
Assessments : Subjects may experience emotional distress during assessments , from discussing feelings and 
attitudes about smoking , or from learning about the risks from smoking. These events happen very rarely and in 
almost all cases are s hort-lived and of low intensity. Study personnel will be alerted to expect this from a small 
number of subjects and will be trained to make referrals for mental health services as needed. Personnel will be 
trained to query for adverse emotional reactions d uring assessments and will be trained to deal with such 
reactions and to provide additional referrals if needed. In addition, if assessments indicate psychiatric concerns, 
referrals to appropriate psychological services will be provided.  
 
2.  Potential Study Benefits  
Participants who enroll in this study will benefit from the knowledge that they are contributing in an important way 
to potentially furthering scientific knowledge concerning ways to improve smoking cessation treatment. All 
smokers will rece ive standard treatment with TN to aid them in their effort to quit smoking and will learn skills to 
stay quit as a result of participating.  
 
3.  Alternatives to Participation  
At any point in the study participants may decide not to continue in their participation. As an alternative to 
enrolling in this study, participants may choose to continue to smoke or to seek assistance with quitting smoking 
through other treatment programs located in the area, other quit -smoking studies at our Center, or contact [CONTACT_485911] -line.

4.2 Adverse Event  Reporting and Monitoring  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  
An Adverse Event (AE) is a subcategory of the broader category of "Unanticipated Problems Posing Risk to 
Subject  or Others ." An adverse event is defined as:  
 
 Any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abn ormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease occurring  
at any stage of the study  
 Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms   
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
 May include an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition, intercurrent illness  or injury , drug interaction, drug 
overdose, failure of expected action or significant worsening of the disease under study  
 An event that may compromise the rights, safety, or welfare of research subjects  
 
Any event that could be characterized by [CONTACT_485914].  
 
Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of  major clinical 
significa nce. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other  serious 
outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure th at did not result in in -patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of broncho spasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_48517].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious will be regarded as non-serious adverse 
events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adve rse events must be reported is the period from the initiation of any study 
procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined as 
[ADDRESS_624202] administration of study treatment.  A compi[INVESTIGATOR_485889].   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition will be recorded as 
an adverse ev ent if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the 
study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also 
be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
         University of Pennsylvania    Institutional Review Board  
 
page 20 of 29 IRB APPLICATION  Template Version: [ADDRESS_624203] to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subj ect’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17232] 
a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for 
surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in 
the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting 
condition.  Surgery will not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery 
was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_485890]. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be ex ercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in 
other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_485891]. These should also usually be considered serious.  Other kinds of events can be 
labeled “serious adverse events” at the discretion of the investigator.   
 
To ensure no confusion or misu nderstanding of the difference between the terms "serious" and "severe," which 
are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is provided: The term "severe" is often used to describe the 
intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, modera te, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, 
however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"serious," which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated wit h events that pose a 
threat to a patient's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.  
 
Severity Grading Scale for Adverse Events  
Many disease specific groups have developed toxicity gr ading scales. For example, most cancer clinical trials use 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) developed by [CONTACT_6812]. The CTCAE provides a 
descriptive terminology which is utilized for adverse event reporting. A grading (severity) sca le is provided for 
each adverse event term (http://ctep.info.nih.gov ). If no guidelines exist, then the following scale can be used:  
• Mild:  Noticeable to the subject, does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities, usually does not require 
additional therapy, dose reduction, or discontinuation of the study.  
• Moderate:  Interferes with the subject’s daily activities, possibly requires additional therapy, but does not require 
discontinuation of the study.   
• Severe:  Severely limits the subject ’s daily activities and may require discontinuation of the study.   This would 
include all adverse events defined as “serious adverse events”.  
 
Attribution/Association with the Drug or Intervention:   
An assessment of the relationship between the adverse event and the drug/intervention will be made for each 
occurrence by [CONTACT_079].   
 
Adverse Event Attribution Categories:  
• Unrelated  - The AE is clearly NOT related to the intervention  
• Unlikely  - The AE is doubtfully related to the inte rvention  
• Possible  - The AE may be related to the intervention  
         University of Pennsylvania    Institutional Review Board

• Probable  - The AE is likely related to the intervention  
• Definite  - The AE is clearly related to the intervention  
 
4.[ADDRESS_624204] (SEC) at 
each study visit after the Intake  reporting with a frame of reference  since their last study visit . The SEC will assess 
the frequency and severity of common side -effects associated with ramelteon or TN treatment. These items will 
be rated by [CONTACT_112503] a 0 (none) to 3 (severe) scale, and can be summed to provide an overall side effects 
index.    
 
Second, trained staff will ask participants a non -structured, open -ended question  (SEC Open -ended)  at each 
study visit with a one week frame of reference  to assess if participants are experiencing any additional symptoms 
or medical concerns that may be related to their participation in the study.  
 
Research staff are trained to inquire (time of onset, natur e of issue reported, possible relation to ramelteon/TN  
treatment, review of previously reported side effects or concerns, etc.) about any notable side effects or medical 
concern reported by [CONTACT_4317].  Any severe (or a pattern of moderate) side effects or notable medical concern 
will be reported to the Project Manager, Study Physician , and Principal Investigator [CONTACT_156869] a course of 
action (e.g. continue to monitor, reduce medication, stop medication).  This consult, including all relevant 
informatio n, will be documented via email. The Study Physician is knowledgeable of side effects related to 
ramelteon/TN  and is qualified to manage possible side effects.  
 
Based on published reports using t he 8mg dose of ramelteon and [ADDRESS_624205] these side effects to be mild and transient in nature. However, in the unlikely event of an adverse 
event (AE) the study physician will determine the severity of the AE, the relationship of the event to the study drug 
and decide th e course of action for the study subject. The study physician will determine the relationship of 
toxicity of the study medication as not related, possibly related, probably related, or definitely re lated using 
standard criteria.  
 
All adverse events occurr ing during each study period will be recorded. The clinical course of each event will be 
followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is 
not the cause. Serious adverse events that are s till ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to 
determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be 
possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be reco rded and reported immediately.  
 
4.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
The following information about adverse events will be reported:   
 Study Identifier  
 Study Center  
 Subject number  
 A description of the event  
 Date of onset  
 Current status  
 Whether study treatment was discontinued  
 The reason why the event is classified as serious  
 Investigator assessment of the association between the event and study treatment  
  Welfare of subjects.  
 
4.5 Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB  
This section describes the requirements for safety reporting by [CONTACT_145181], affiliated with a 
Penn research site, or otherwise responsible for safety reporting to the Penn IRB. The University of Pennsylvania 
IRB (Penn IRB) require s expedited reporting of those events related to study participation that are unforeseen and 
         University of Pennsylvania    Institutional Review Board  
 
page 22 of 29 IRB APPLICATION  Template Version: 23 April 2010  
indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  The Penn IRB will not acknowledge safety 
reports or bulk adverse event submissions that do not meet the criteria outlined below.  The Penn IRB requires 
researchers to submit reports of the following problems within 10 working days from the time the investigator 
becomes aware of the event:  
 Any adverse event  (regardless of whether the event is serious  or non -serious, on -site or off -site) that 
occurs any time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_58812]:  
Unexpected  (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately reflected in the  
protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any applicable investigator 
brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent document and other relevant sources of 
information, such as product labeling and package inserts.)  
AND  
Related  to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_328989], the event was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_485915].)  
 
Reporting Process  
Unanticipat ed problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the Penn IRB using 
the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or Others Including Reportable Adverse Events” or 
as a written report of the event (including a description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the 
above criteria, follow -up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other study documentation).  
  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_485892]’s 
study file.  
 
Reporting Deaths :  more rapid reporting requirements  
Concerning deaths that occur during the course of a research study, the following describes the more rapid 
reporting requirement of the Penn IR B for specific situations:  
 Report the event within 24 hours  when the death is unforeseen (unexpected) and indicates participants or 
others are at increased risk of harm.  
 Report the event within 72 hours,  for all other deaths, regardless of whether the death is related to study 
participation.  
 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the Penn IRB may be made by [CONTACT_116627]. The AE/Unanticipated Problem Form is required as a follow up to the initial submission.  
 
Reporting SAEs  
• Penn Subjects (including subjects at networks, affiliates or investigator -initiated sites) ;   
All on -site grade [ADDRESS_624206] 
receive d study treatment/therapy or was exposed to an investigational device.  All unexpected deaths or deaths 
related to the study agent(s)/device(s) must be reported within 24 hours. All other deaths should be reported 
within 30 days.   
 
Other Reportable events : 
- For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the Penn IRB:  
- Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious unexpected adverse 
event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as agranuloc ytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens -
Johnson syndrome).  
- Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the inv estigators brochure, protocol or  
informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_116628].  
         University of Pennsylvania    Institutional Review Board  
 
page 23 of 29 IRB APPLICATION  Template Version: 23 April 2010  
- Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity or 
frequency. For example:  
o An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment than 
initially expected.  
o Safety  monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially expected.  
o A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study is of no 
therapeutic value.  
o Change in FDA safety labeling or  withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic used in a 
research protocol.  
o Breach of confidentiality  
o Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a 
research participant.  
- Incarceration of a part icipant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and the 
investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain in the study.  
- Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot be 
resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
- Exception : A one time, intentional action or process that departs from the IRB and CTSRMC approved 
study protocol, intended for one occurrence. If the action disrupts the study progress, such that the study 
design o r outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the action compromises the safety and welfare of 
study subjects, advanc e documented IRB approval is required.  
- For exceptions on Industry or Cooperative group sponsored protocols, written approval must be obtaine d 
from the Sponsor prior to submitting your  exception request to the IRB. 
- For in -house studies with a Medical Monitor or Safety Monitoring Committee (not DSMB), approval must 
be obtained from the Medical Monitor or Safety Monitoring Committee prior to subm itting your exception 
request to the IRB. 
- Deviation : A one time, unintentional action or proces s that departs from the IRB approved study protocol, 
involving one incident and identified retrospectively, after the event occurred. If the impact on the protocol 
disrupts the study design, m ay affect the outcome (endpoints) or compromises the safety and welfare of 
the subjects, the deviation must be re ported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_624207] 
completed the CITI-Protection of Human Subjects Research Training  as well as HIPAA Compliance Training.

Risk/Benefit Assess ment  
The importance of this research outweighs the risks to subjects, which are minor. There is minimal risk for serious 
adverse events. The treatments and procedures used in this study have been shown to be relatively safe. 
Numerous clinical trials have d emonstrated the safety and efficacy of ramelteon and TN. Research staff will 
monitor subjects closely during their participation. Data from this project will serve as preliminary data to formally  
test ramelteon  as an adjunct behavioral component to smoking  cessation treatment.

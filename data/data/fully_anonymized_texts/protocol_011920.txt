PROTOCOL  TITLE:  A CONTROLLED, PARALLEL -GROUP, RANDOMIZED, OPEN -LABEL 
STUDY TO EVALUATE TWO LENALIDOMIDE DOSE REGIMENS WHEN USED IN 
COMBINATION WITH LOW DOSE DEXAMETHASONE FOR THE TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
WITH RELAPSED MULTIPLE MYELOMA  
 
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  RV 
DATE PRO TOCOL FINAL:  9-17-2009  
STUDY DRUG:  Revlimid®, lenalidomide  
INDICATION:  15 mg and 25 mg of lenalidomide in 
conjunction with low dose dexamethasone  
STUDY PHASE:  II 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:   Several studies have shown that combination 
chemotherapy with addition of other alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or nitrosureas 
and anthracyclines does not improve the prognosis of subjects with multiple myeloma beyond 
results obtained with standard MP (Oken, 1994; Oken, et al. 1997). Notably, the median su rvival 
of subjects who achieve stable disease (lack of disease progression) is similar to that in subjects 
who respond to therapy and is superior to survival in subjects whose disease progresses (49 
months versus 48 months versus 15 months) (Durie and Salm on, 1975). A recent trial conducted 
by [CONTACT_170123] (ECOG) compared MP therapy to the combination 
treatment regimen of vincristine, carmustine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone 
(VBMCP) (Oken, et al. 1997). Although VBMCP re sulted in a 72% objective response compared 
to 52% for MP, the median survivals of both Cohorts were not different. Interferon (IFN), either as 
part of induction treatment or as maintenance therapy, is only of marginal benefit (Ludwig, et al. 
1995). Althou gh subjects with progressive disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_438278] a 50 to 75% response to salvage regimens such as vincristine, 
doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD) (Barlogie, et al. 1984; Monconduit, et al.  1986), these 
responses are usually of short (months) duration. Myeloma, therefore, remains universally fatal, 
and the median survival of affected subjects is 3 to 4 years.  
The primary rationale is to utilize Revlimid at dose that will be well tolerated a nd effective. We 
propose to use the need for dose reduction as a criterion  to judge tolerability from various causes. 
In the veteran population which predominantly is  in the older age category with number of co -
morbidities, a lower dose regimen may be safe r and advantageous. In a recent multi -institutional 
study, the 009 and 010 studies , patients were randomized to r eceive Revlimid with 
dexamethasone  versus dexamethasone alone. A logistic regression was performed using dose 
reduction (i.e., whether or not h aving any lenalidomide dose reduction as the dependent 
variable). Treatment -emergent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the causes of the 
majority of dose reductions. Predictors analyzed  included: age, prior transplant (yes vs. no), high 
vs. low risk (d isease stage variable), previous thalidomide exposure (yes vs. no), previous lines of 
therapy (<=2 vs. 3+), prior medical history of neutropenia  or thrombocytopenia. Among the 353 
patients in the Revlimid/Dexamethasone groups,  131 (37.1%)  had at least one dose reduction of

Lenalidomide (Revlimid®)                                                                                   Protocol :  
 
Version date 02.14.2013  Revlimid. Age, whether used as a continuous variable or dichotomized one (<=65 vs. 66+), was 
the single significant predictor for dose reduction; 46% of the patients aged [ADDRESS_555438] one dose reduction, as compared to 31 % of the patients aged [ADDRESS_555439] on efficacy.  
STUDY OBJECTIVES:  
Primary:    
• The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the frequency of dose reductions in two 
different lenalidomide dose regimens . 
Secondary:    
Secondary objectives are to:  
• Evaluate the efficacy of t wo different lenalidomide dose regimens in patients with multiple 
myeloma using the EBMT and IMWG criteria.   
• Evaluate the duration of response of 15 mg Lenalidomide and 25 mg of Lenalidomide 
when used in combination with Low Dose Dexamethasone.  
• Evaluate t he safety of 15 mg and 25 mg of Lenalidomide regiments when in combination 
with dexamethasone.  
• Explore blood and cellular levels of angiogenic factors, cytokines, and adhesion 
molecules.  
STUDY DESIGN:  
This is a multi -center, controlled, open -label, random ized (1:1) parallel group study intended to 
select a tolerable dose regimen with acceptable efficacy of lenalidomide, when used in 
combination with dexamethasone.  
 
Subjects will receive either oral lenalidomide 25 mg once daily for days 1 -21 out of a 28 c ycle or 
lenalidomide 15 mg once daily for 1 -21 of a 28 day cycle. Subjects will be assessed before the 
start of treatment, and every 4 weeks while on therapy. Subjects will also receive 40 mg of 
dexamethasone once a week , (days 1,8,15,  22), and ASA  (81 or 325 mg) will be  given daily for 
anticoagulation prophylaxis.  Lenalidomide will be reduced if patients develop grade [ADDRESS_555440] a mi nimal response (MR) has not resulted after cycle 4 then the patient will be 
taken off the study. (see Section 5.7). Subjects who continue to show evidence of myeloma 
response will remain on the study and will be evaluated every 4 weeks for response and/or 
progression.   
STUDY ENDPOINTS  
Primary:  
• Type, frequency, severity and timing of adverse events and their relationship to 
combination therapy with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone  
Secondary:  
• Duration of M -Protein response during combination therapy with lena lidomide plus 
dexamethasone  
• Confirmed M -Protein response  
• Expression of angiogenic factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and myeloma

Version date 02.14.2013  3 Background and Rationale  
3.1 Introduction  
Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analog, belongs to a proprietary class of Celgene 
compounds called immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs®).  IMiDs® have both 
immunomodulatory and anti -angiogenic properties which could  confer antitumor 
and antimetastatic effects.  
Although the exact antitumor mechanism of action of lenalidomide is unknown, a 
number of mechanisms are postulated to be r esponsible for lenalidomide’s 
activity against multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide has direct activity against 
multiple myeloma and induces apoptosis or G1growth arrest in multiple myeloma 
cell lines and in multiple myeloma cells of patients resistant to melpha lan, 
doxorubicin and dexamethasone (5). Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analog, has 
been demonstrated to possess anti -angiogenic activity through inhibition of 
bFGF, VEGF and TNF -alpha induced endothelial cell migra tion, due at least in 
part to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation response to bFGF.(1).  In addition, 
lenalidomide has a variety of immunomodulatory effects.  Lenalidomide 
stimulates T cell proliferation, and the production of IL -2, IL-10 and IFN -gamma, 
inhibits IL -1 beta and IL -6 and modulates IL -12 production.(2)  Upregulation of T 
cell derived IL -[ADDRESS_555452] in part through increased AP -1 
activit y. (3)The increased level of these circulating cytokines augment natural killer 
cell number and function, and enhance natural killer cell activity to yield an 
increase in multiple myeloma cell lysis (4).  
3.[ADDRESS_555453] been treated 
with lenalidomide.  In one study at the University of Arkansas, 15 patients who 
relapsed or were refractory to high dose melphalan therapy with stem cell 
transplant were treated for 4 weeks in an open -label safety study and were 
permitted to continue therapy in an extension phase of the trial.  Patient cohorts 
were treated at the following daily doses: 5mg, 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg (9).  In a 
similar study at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, 27 patients with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_438279] (10).   
Anti-myeloma activity was observed in each of these 2 phase I studies.  
Decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts were the dose -limiting toxicities 
associated with lenalidomide.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not

Version date 02.14.[ADDRESS_555454] widely used in future studies has been 
lenalidomide 25 mg on Days 1 -21, repeated every 28 days.   
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients 
treated in the phase I studies.  Absorption was found to be rapid on both Day 1 
and Day 28 with time to maximum blood levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at 
all dose levels (5 mg, 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg).  Plasma lenalidomide declined in 
a monophasic manner with elimination half -life ranging from 2.8 to 6.1 hours on 
both Day 1 and 28 at all 4 doses.  No plasma accumulation was observed with 
multiple daily dosing.  Peak and overall  plasma concentrations were dose 
proportional over the dosing range of 5mg to 50mg (11). 
A multicenter, randomized, phase II trial compared 2 syncopated dose schedules 
of lenalidomide (15 mg B.D. vs. 30 mg O.D.)  used alone or in combination with 
dexamethasone in the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.  All 
patients were treated on Days 1 -21 of a 28 -day cycle.  Patients treated with 
15mg BID experienced more myelosuppression and dose reductions c ompared 
with patients treated with 30mg daily.  Anti -myeloma activity was observed with 
each dose and schedule of single agent lenalidomide.  The addition of 
dexamethasone to lenalidomide yielded responses in some patients who had not 
responded to lenalido mide alone (12). 
Celgene Corporation sponsored 2 multicenter, randomized, double -blinded, 
placebo -controlled phase III trials [1 U.S. (MM -009) and 1 international (MM -
010)] in patients with relapsed or refractor y multiple myeloma (14).  More than 350 
patients were enrolled into each of these studies.  All patients had to be 
considered sensitive to dexamethasone and were treated with dexamethasone 
40mg daily on Days 1 -4, 9-12 and 17 -20.  In addition to receiving 
dexamethasone, patients were randomized to lenalidomide 25mg or placebo 
each given daily on Days 1 -21.  Cycles were repeated every 28 days.   After 4 
cycles, there was a predetermined reduction of the dexamethaso ne dose to 
40mg daily on Days 1 -4 repeated every 28 days.  In both studies, a pre -specified 
interim analysis conducted by [CONTACT_438287] (Len) plus 
dexamethasone  (Dex) had significantly longer times to progression and higher 
response rates (D 27% vs. 2D 61%, p<0.001) than those treated with single -
agent dexamethasone.  These studies led to the FDA approval of lenalidomide in 
combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in

efficacy in relapsed patients, a recent phase II trial utilizing lenalidomide plus 
dexamethasone for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients wa s recently 
reported by [CONTACT_68281]. Lenalidomide was given orally 25 mg daily on days 
1-21 of a 28 -day cycle. Dexamethasone was given orally 40 mg daily on days 1 -
4, 9-12, 17 -20 of each cycle. Objective response was defined as a decrease in 
serum monoc lonal protein by 50% or greater and a decrease in urine M protein 
by [CONTACT_2669] 90% or to a level less than 200 mg/[ADDRESS_555456] 4 weeks apart. Thirty -one of 34 (91%) 
patients achieved an objective response, i ncluding 2 (6%) achieving complete 
response (CR), and 11 (32%) meeting criteria for both very good partial response 
and near complete response, resulting in an overall objective response rate of 
91%. Of the 3 remaining patients not achieving an objective r esponse, two had 
minor response (MR) and one stable disease. Forty -seven percent of patients 
experienced grade [ADDRESS_555457] commonly fatigue 
(15%), muscle weakness (6%), anxiety (6%), pneumonitis (6%) and rash (6%). 
Revlimid®/ dexamethasone is a highly active regimen with manageable side -
effects in the treatment of newly diagnosed myeloma.(18)  
3.3 Rationale  
The primary rationale is to utilize Revlimid at dose that will be well tolerated and 
effective. We propose to use the need for dose reduction as a criterion  to judge 
tolerability from various causes. In the veteran population which predominantly is  
in the older age category with number of co -morbidities, a lower dose regimen 
may be safer and advantageous. In a recent multi -institu tional study, the 009 and 
010 studies , patients were randomized to receive Revlimid with dexamethasone  
versus dexamethasone alone. A logistic regression was performed using dose 
reduction (i.e., whether or not having any lenalidomide dose reduction as the 
dependent variable). Treatment -emergent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 
were the causes of the majority of dose reductions. Predictors analyzed  included: 
age, prior transplant (yes vs. no), high vs. low risk (disease stage variable), 
previous thalidomide exposure (yes vs. no), previous lines of therapy (<=2 vs. 
3+), prior medical history of neutropenia  or thrombocytopenia. Among the 353 
patients in the Revlimid/Dexamethasone groups,  131 (37.1%)  had at least one 
dose reduction of Revlimid. Age, whether used  as a continuous variable or 
dichotomized one (<=65 vs. 66+), was the single significant predictor for dose 
reduction; 46% of the patients aged [ADDRESS_555458] one dose 
reduction, as compared to 31% of the patients aged 65 or younger. Of

3.3.1  INDICATIONS AND  [LOCATION_003]GE:  
Revlimid® is approved in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of 
patients with multiple myeloma that have received at least one prior therapy.  
Revlimid® (lenalidomide) is also indicated for the treatment of  patients with 
transfusion -dependent anemia due to Low - or Intermediate -1-risk 
myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic 
abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.  
3.[ADDRESS_555460] frequently reported adverse events reported during clinical studies with 
lenalidomide in oncologic and non -oncologic indications, regardless of presumed 
relationship to study medication include: anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia 
and pancytopenia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, dehydrati on, 
rash, itching, infections, sepsis, pneumonia, UTI, Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416],  
atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, chest pain,

dyspnea, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, CVA, 
convulsions,   spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377], disease progression, death not specified 
and fractures .  Tumor flare reaction (TF R) has been reported frequently in CLL 
patients treated with lenalidomide.  Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been 
reported in CLL patients treated with lenalidomide.  Precautions must be taken to 
prevent TLS including proper selection of patients with regard  to renal function, 
correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and TLS prophylaxis and monitoring.  
Lenalidomide has been shown to increase the level of digoxin in the blood in 
some patients . 
 
Second new cancers  
According to researchers, patients with cancer  have a higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
second new cancer when compared to people without cancer. In clinical studies 
of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, a higher number of second cancers were 
reported in patients treated with induction therapy (treatment as first step to 
reducing number of cancer cells) and/or bone marrow transplant then 
lenalidomide for a long period of time compared to patients treated with induction 
therapy and/or bone marrow transplant then placebo (a capsule containing no 
lenalidomide). Patients should make their doctors aware of their medical history

5.1 Overall design  
This is a multi -center, controlled, open -label, randomized (1:1) parallel group 
study intended to select the dose regimen with the most promising efficacy of 
Lenalidomide, when used in combin ation with dexamethasone.  
Subjects will receive either oral Lenalidomide 25 mg once daily for days 1 -21 out 
of a 28 cycle or Lenalidomide 15 mg once daily for 1 -21 of a 28 day cycle.  
Subjects will also receive 40 mg of dexamethasone once a week  (Days 1, 8, 15 
and 22)  with a dose reduction on the same schedule if the patient cannot 
tolerate the higher dose of dexamethasone (refer to Section 5.5.3).   ASA ([ADDRESS_555462] a minimal response (MR) has not resulted after cycle 4, then the patient 
will be taken off the study. Subjects who continue to show evidence o f myeloma 
response will remain on the study and will be evaluated every 4 weeks for 
response/progression.  
5.1.1  Investigational Drug  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lenalidomide Description  
REVLIMID®  (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory 
agent with anti -angiogenic p roperties.  The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 3 -(4-amino -1-oxo 
1,3-dihydro -2H-isoindol -2-yl) pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510] -2,6-dione and it has the following 
chemical structure:

The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193038] C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular 
weight is 259.3.  
Lenalidomide is an off -white to pale -yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic 
solvent/water mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more 
soluble in organic solvents and low pH solutions. Solubility was significantly lower 
in less acidic buffers, ranging from about 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an 
asymmetric carbon atom and can exist as the optically active forms S( -) and 
R(+), and is produ ced as a racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of zero.

[IP_ADDRESS]  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
Mechanism of Action:  
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be full y characterized. 
Lenalidomide possesses immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  
Lenalidomide inhibited the secretion of pro -inflammatory cytokines and increased 
the secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells.  Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation with varying effectiveness (IC50s) 
in some but not all cell lines.  Of cell lines tested, lenalidomide was effective in 
inhibiting growth of Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a 
deletion of one chromosome 5) but was much less effective in inhibiting growth of 
KG-1 cells (human myeloblastic cell line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 
5) and other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited 
the expression of cyclooxygen ase-2 (COX -2) but not COX -1 in vitro.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism:  
Absorption:  
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_299755] 0.[ADDRESS_555463] -dose. Co -administration with food does not alter the extent of 
absorption (AUC) but does reduce the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 
36%. The pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC 
increase proportionately with increases i n dose. Multiple dosing at the 
recommended dose -regimen does not result in drug accumulation.  
Pharmacokinetic sampling in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients was not 
performed. In multiple myeloma patients maximum plasma concentrations 
occurred between  0.[ADDRESS_555464] -dose both on Days 1 and 28.  AUC and 
Cmax values increase proportionally with dose following single and multiple 
doses. Exposure (AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 57% higher than in 
healthy male volunteers.  
 
Pharmacokinetic Par ameters:  
Distribution:  
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%.  
Metabolism and Excretion:  
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy 
volunteers, approximately two -thirds of lenalidom ide is eliminated unchanged

5.6 Concomitant therapy   
5.6.1  Recommended concomitant therapy   
Subjec ts should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and 
blood products, antibiotics, and antiemetics when appropriate.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anticoagulation Consideration   
Lenalidomide increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients who are at high 
risk or with a history a thrombosis, in particular when combined with other drugs 
known to cause thrombosis. When lenalidomide is combined with other agents 
such as steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone), anthracyclines (Doxil, 
Adriamycin) and erythropoie tin the risk of thrombosis is increased.  
Daily aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 or 325 mg) or some other form of prophylaxis as deemed 
appropriate  is required . Low molecular weight heparin may be utilized in patients 
that are intolerant to ASA. Coumadin should be used with ca ution and close 
monitoring of INR.  
5.6.2  Prohibited concomitant therapy  
Concomitant use of sargramostim (GM -CSF), other anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
including radiation, thalidomide, or other investigational agents is not permitted 
while subjects are receiving study d rug during the treatment phase of the study.

6 Adverse events  
6.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition  
A serious adverse event is one that  at any dose (including overdose):  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening [ADDRESS_555475]  
 Is an important medical event 3

Version date 02.14.2013   
 
 1“Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the serious adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
2“Persistent or s ignificant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in situa tions where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  
Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438281].  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as 
medically important.  
6.2 Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version  3.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 3.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP 
homepage (HTTP://CTEP.INFO.NIH .GOV ).  All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 3.0.  All adverse clinical 
experiences, whether observed by [CONTACT_56313], 
must be recorded, with details about the duration and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], 
the action taken with respect to the test drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The 
investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for its relationship to the test 
drug and for its seriousness.  
 
The investigator must appraise all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical 
significance.  If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, 
the investigator must provide details about the action taken with respect to the 
test drug and about the patient’s outcome.  
 
SPMs are considered events of interest and should be included as part of th e 
assessment of adverse events throughout the course of the study.  Investigators 
are to report any second primary malignancies as serious adverse events 
regardless of causal relationship to lenalidomide, occurring at any time for the 
duration of the study    For all subjects who develop second primary 
malignancies, sites will be required to submit all diagnostic reports (eg pathology, 
cytogenetics, flow cytometry results) from the indication diagnostic confirmation 
samples submitted at screening and all rep orts for the tumor samples  from the 
SPM diagnosis.  For SPMs diagnosed at another institution (outside the

SPM confirmation.  
 
6.2.1  Pregnancies  
Pregnancies and suspected pregn ancies (including a positive pregnancy test 
regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the 
subject  is on lenalidomide or within [ADDRESS_555476]’s last dose of 
lenalidomide are considered immediately  reportable events.   If the subject is on 
lenalidomide, it is to be discontinued immediately and the subject is to be 
instructed to return any unused portion of lenalidomide to the Investigator.  The 
pregnancy must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately of the 
Invest igator’s knowledge of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_438290] . 
 
The Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy, and 
must notify Celgene  Drug Safety immediately about the  outcome of the 
pregna ncy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up 
Report Form .  If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous 
or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as 
an AE. If the abnormal outc ome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be 
reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other 
appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event 
using the SAE Report Form,  
 
 
All neonatal deaths  that occur within [ADDRESS_555477] to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the 
Investigator suspects is  related to the in utero  exposure to lenalidomide should 
also be reported  to Celgene  Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other 
appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event 
using the SAE Report Form.   
 
Male Subjects  
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes 
pregnan t, the male subject taking lenalidomide should notify the Investigator, and 
the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider 
immediately.

lenalidomide, when used in combination with dexamethasone.   Patients will be 
randomized with 1:1 ratio to  receive  lenalidomide 25 
mg + dexamethasone  or lenalidomide  15mg  + dexamethasone.   The primary 
objective of the study is to evaluate the fre quency of dose reductions in two 
different lenalidomide dose regimens. The study will help in selecting a safe 
lenalidomide dose for the elderly population.  
 
10.2 Datasets to be analyzed  
All analyses will be based on mITT population defined as below.  
Modif ied Intent -to-treat (mITT) population: The  mITT population will be defined as 
all subjects randomized into the trial  who received at least one dose of 
lenalidomide. Treatment classification will be based on the randomized 
treatment.

differences among the four groups on demographic variables will be tested. 
Those variables that are categorical will be ana lyzed by [CONTACT_438293].; those variables 
that are quantitative will be analyzed by [CONTACT_1192] -way between -groups Analyses of 
Variance. Any variable where a significant difference is established will be 
controlled by [CONTACT_438294].  
 
The primary  outcome variable is the proportion of patients in each treatment arm 
that received any dosage reduction, independent of when in the course of 
treatment this reduction occurred or how many subsequent reductions were 
introduced. These data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_438295]. A secondary analysis will consider the rate at which any dose 
reductions were introduced. For example, it is possib le that the proportion of 
patients that receive  a dose reduction may be equivalent in the two treatment 
arms, but that those patients in one arm may have received their reductions 
earlier. This will be examined by a Cox Proportional Hazard test, and, if 
necessary, with the same covariates identified above.  
 
Power analysis shows that with a total N = 80 (40/group) power = .[ADDRESS_555492] size difference in proportions of 32% (p=.05, 2 -tail) (Borenstein M, 
Rothstein H and Cohen J.  Power and Precision  (2004). Englewood, NJ, Biostat).  
 
This sample size provides adequate power to observe similar difference in dose 
reduction between the two groups for a range of dose reductions (10% - 40%) 
in 15mg dose group.  
 
Secondary endpoints: Although this study is n ot powered to compare response 
as well as duration of response to the [ADDRESS_555493] evidence of either partial re sponse 
or complete response as determined using the EBMT and IMWG criteria . One -
sided 95% confidence limits on the lower limit of the percentage of responders 
will be established to determine if this lower bound exceeds 45%. Duration of 
response is compute d among the subgroup of subjects whose best response is 
PR or better. It is defined as is the time from when measurement criteria are first 
met for objective response until the date of progression or death. A subject with 
an objective response who does not  have a progression event will be censored 
at the same time as he or she was censored under the primary definition of PFS.

Data from all subjects who receive any study drug will be included in the safety 
analyses. Subjects who entered the study and did not take any of the study 
drug(s) and had this confirmed, will not be evaluated for safety.

Appendix A: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines 
and Acceptable Birth Control Methods  
Risks Associated with Pregnancy  
The use of lenalidomide in pregnant females and nursing mothers has not bee n 
studied nor has the effect of the lenalidomide on human eggs and sperm.  
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide.  Thalidomide is a known 
human teratogenic active substance that causes severe life -threatening birth 
defects.  An embryofetal de velopment study in animals indicates that 
lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who 
received the drug during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in 
humans cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a risk minimization plan to prevent 
pregnancy must be observed.  
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)  
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature 
female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 
2) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy 
does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., 
has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).  
Counseling  
For a female of ch ildbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all 
of the following are met (i.e., all females of childbearing potential must be 
counseled concerning the following risks and requirements prior to the start of 
lenalidomide study therapy):  
• She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child  
• She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 
28 days before starting lenalidomide, throughout the entire duration of 
lenalidomide treatment, including dose inter ruptions, and for 28 days after 
the end of lenalidomide treatment  
• She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive 
measures

Version date 02.14.2013  • She is informed and understands the potential consequences of 
pregnancy and the need to notify her study doctor immed iately if there is a 
risk of pregnancy  
• She understands the need to commence the study treatment as soon as 
lenalidomide is dispensed following a negative pregnancy test  
• She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing 
based on the frequenc y outlined in this protocol.  
• She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary 
precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide  
The investigator must ensure that:  
• Females of childbearing potential comply with the conditions for 
pregnancy r isk minimization, including confirmation that she has an 
adequate level of understanding, and acknowledge the aforementioned 
requirements  
• Females NOT of childbearing potential acknowledge that she understands 
the hazards and necessary precautions associate d with the use of 
lenalidomide  
• Male patients taking lenalidomide acknowledge that he understands that 
traces of lenalidomide have been found in semen, that he understands the 
potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a female of 
childbe aring potential, and that he understands the need for the use of a 
condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if engaged in sexual activity with 
a female of childbearing potential.   
Contraception  
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must agree to use two  reliable forms 
of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from 
heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) 
for at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide ; 2) while participating in the 
study; and 3) for at least 28 days after discontinuation from the study.  
 
 † A female of childbearing potential is a  sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at leas t 24 
consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).

method and one additional effective (barrier) method FCBP must be referred to a 
qualified provider of contra ceptive methods if needed. The following are 
examples of highly effective and additional effective methods of contraception:

▪ Intrauterine device (IUD)  
▪ Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants)  
▪ Tubal ligation  
▪ Partner’s  vasectomy  
o Additional effective methods:  
▪ Male condom  
▪ Diaphragm  
▪ Cervical Cap  
  
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with 
multiple myeloma taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral 
contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_438285].  If a patient is currently using combined 
oral contraception the patient should switch to one of the effective method listed 
above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4−6  weeks after 
discontinuing combined oral contraception. The effica cy of contraceptive steroids 
may be reduced during co -treatment with dexamethasone.  
Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine systems are associated with 
an increased risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal 
bleeding. Proph ylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in patients 
with neutropenia.  
Pregnancy testing  
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 50 mIU/mL 
must be performed for females of childbearing potential, including females o f 
childbearing potential who commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.

Disease Response Criteria  
Response  Criteria for Response  
Complete Response (CR)  Requires all of the following:  
• Disappearance of the original monoclonal protein from 
the blood and ur ine on at least two determinations for a 
minimum of six weeks by [CONTACT_254933]  
• < 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow on at least one 
determination  
• No increase in the size or number of lytic bone lesions 
(development of a compression fracture does n ot 
exclude response)  
• Disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas for at least 
six weeks.  
Near CR  • Requires all of above except immunofixation remains 
positive  
• Or normal FLC ratio  
Partial Response (PR)  Requires all of the following:  
• > 50% reduction in the l evel of serum monoclonal 
protein for at least two determinations six weeks apart  
• If present, reduction in 24 -hour urinary light chain 
excretion by [CONTACT_5640]  > 90% or to < [ADDRESS_555508] two 
determinations six weeks apart  
• > 50% reduction in the size of so ft tissue 
plasmacytomas (by [CONTACT_438303]) 
for at least six weeks  
• No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions 
(development of compression fracture does not exclude 
response)  
• If the serum and urine M -protein are unmeasurable a  ≥ 
50% decrease in the difference between involved and 
uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the  M-
protein criteria  
Minimal Response (MR)  Requires all of the following:  
• > 25% to < 49% reduction in the level of serum 
monoclonal protein for at least t wo determinations six 
weeks apart  
• If present, a 50 to 89% reduction in 24 hour light chain 
excretion, which still exceeds 200 mg/24hr, for at least 
two determinations six weeks apart.  
• For patients with non -secretory myeloma only, a 25 to 
49% reduction in p lasma cells in the bone marrow for a 
minimum of six weeks  
• no increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions 
(development of compression fracture does not exclude 
response)

Version date 02.14.2013  Response  Criteria for R esponse  
Progressive Disease  Requires one or more of the following:  
• > 25% increase in the level of serum monoclonal 
paraprotein, which must also be an absolute increase of 
at least 5G/dL and confirmed on a repeat investigation  
• > 25% increase in [ADDRESS_555509] 200 
mg/24hours and confirmed on a repeat investigation  
• > 25% increase in plasma cells in a bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_207097], which must also be an 
absolute increase o f at least 10%  
• Only in patients without measureable serum and urine 
M-protein levels: the difference between involved and 
uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase must be 
<10mg/L)  
• Definite increase in the size of existing lytic bone lesions 
or soft tissue plasmacytomas  or definite development of 
new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas  
• Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum 
calcium > 11.5 mg/dL or 2.8 mmol/L not attributable to 
any other cause)  
 
Relapse from CR  Requires at least one of the foll owing:  
• Reappearance of serum or urinary paraprotein on 
immunofixation or routine electrophoresis confirmed by 
[CONTACT_318620] -up and excluding oligoclonal immune 
reconstitution  
• > 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_438286]  
• Development of new lytic bone lesions or soft tissue 
plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of 
residual bone lesions (not including compression 
fracture).  
• Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum 
calcium > 11.5 mg/dL or 2.8 mmol/L not attributable to 
any other c ause).  
 
*Note clarification to IMWG criteria for coding CR and VGPR in patients in whom the only 
measurable disease is by [CONTACT_128758]:  CR in such patients a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 -
1.65 in addition to CR criteria listed above. VGPR in such patients  is defined as a >90% decrease 
in the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain FLC levels.

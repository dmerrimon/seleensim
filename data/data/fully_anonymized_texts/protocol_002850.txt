Patients with a PSA > 0.2 n g/ml after 6 -18 
months of androgen suppression therapy are 
identified, screened, and consented.  
Patients receive a dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 
mg/kg IV every three weeks for the first 
12 weeks.  
For weeks 12 -24, patients are observed 
for progression.  
Patients who do not progress by [CONTACT_5875] 24 
will receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10  mg/kg IV 
every three months for weeks [ADDRESS_1033018] Protocol Shell, Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  7  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Ti tle: A Phase II Study of CTLA Blockade by [CONTACT_383][INVESTIGATOR_754643] & 
Names:  This study is currently open at Oregon Health & Science 
Univer sity and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey.  
Research 
Hypothesis:  The early addition of immunotherapy in patients with metastatic 
prostate cancer who have a poor prognosis as a result of an 
incomplete biochemical response to androgen suppression 
therapy (AST) will improve outcomes to approximate outcomes 
in patients who do obtain a complete biochemical response with 
AST.  
Study Schema:  
Drugs / Doses /  
Length of Treatment)  All patients will receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg by 90 -minute IV 
infusion every thr ee weeks for four doses.  Patients without 
progression at Week 24 will subsequently receive maintenance 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg IV every [ADDRESS_1033019] been given, patients will be 
followed with a serum PSA every 12 weeks (either at the 
research site or at the patient’s treating physi cian) until 
radiographic progression. Survival status will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_119570] [ADDRESS_1033020]/abdomen/pelvis and whole body bone sca ns at baseline, 
[ADDRESS_1033021] four doses (weeks 1, 4, 7, 10).  
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  8  Study Objectives:  
 The primary endpoint  is the proportion of patients who achieve 
an undetectable PSA (≤ 0.2 ng/ml) after initiation of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_131590].  
 
Secondary endpoints  include time to PSA progression, time  to 
disease progression by [CONTACT_79342], time to death from any 
cause, maximum percentage of PSA reduction in each patient, 
response in measurable disease by [CONTACT_13407], measure of 
T cell response by [CONTACT_4133], number of patients with 
immune relat ed Adverse Events (IRAEs) and correlation 
between IRAEs and clinical outcomes. The effect of treatment 
on the ratio of T regulatory cells to T effector cells and 
additional measures of immune response will also be 
determined. To examine correlative biomark ers and their 
relationship to clinical outcomes.  Potential biomarkers include, 
but are not limited to CRP, IGF -1 and –2, or FSH.  
Study Design:  This is a single arm phase II study to examine the activity of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754644] 
(AST).  
Accrual Goal:  30 patients  
Accrual Rate:  60 1 to 2 patients per month  
FPFV:  
LPFV:  
Follow Up:  Recruitment projected to begin 9/2011  
Final patient registration projected for 6/[ADDRESS_1033022] ends the study.  
 
Correlative 
Studies:  We will examine the T cell activation markers (HLA -DR, CD25, 
CD26, CD40L, CD62L, CD69, CD71, CD134) as well as the 
ratio of T effect or to T regulatory cells before and after treatment 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. These tests will be performed in the 
immunology laboratory of Larry Fong, MD, at UCSF. We will 
also examine antigens and correlate with response.  
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  9  Inclusion Criteria:  Men with histologic ally confirmed adenocarcinoma of the 
prostate and radiographically documented metastases treated 
with AST who have a serum PSA > 0.2 ng/mL after [ADDRESS_1033023] a documented white blood cell 
(WBC) count  2x109/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC)  ≥ 
1.0x109/L, a platelet count ≥ 50x109/L, hemoglobin  8 g/dL, 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  2.[ADDRESS_1033024], a serum 
creatinine ≤ 3.[ADDRESS_1033025], bilirubin  [ADDRESS_1033026] 
unless diagnosed with Gilbert’s syndrome and an ECOG 
performance status ≤ 1.  
Exclusion Criteria:  Patients with a life expectancy less than [ADDRESS_1033027] 5 years (other than non -
melanoma skin cancer, or other readily treatable tumors with 
expected cure) will not be eligible for this study. Patients must 
not have a known autoimmune disease, use prednisone > 10 mg 
daily (or its equivalent) ora lly for any indication, or have chronic 
infections (including hepatitis B or C or HIV).  
Criteria for 
Evaluation:  
(Efficacy, safety,  
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], etc.)  Patients will receive a history and physical exam and multiple 
laboratory tests (PSA, complete chemis try panel and blood 
counts, as well as tests for endocrinopathies) at baseline and 
every [ADDRESS_1033028] 4 doses of therapy. Available labs 
(i.e. the chemistry panel and blood counts) will be reviewed prior 
to administration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Imaging  studies will be done at 
baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and then every six months, or 
sooner if concerning symptoms arise. If there is no evidence of 
radiographic progression on the 24 -week scan, patients will go 
on to receive four doses of maintenance ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754645] 
(weeks 24, 36, 48, 60). They will have a history and physical 
exam at least every three months. Their survival status will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_754718] [ADDRESS_1033029] study visit.  
 
Efficacy will be based on the results of the PSA and imaging 
studies (using PCWG2 and modified RECIST criteria). Safety 
will be monitored using the regular physician examinations and 
laboratory assessments.  
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  10  Statistics:  N=30 (for the final analysis, 10 for the intial analysis).  Us ing 
the Simon two -stage design for Phase II trials, the initial accrual 
will be 10 patients.  Assuming that 10% of patients receiving 
usual care will achieve an undetectable PSA without additional 
intervention, the trial has a 80% power to detect a rate of  
achieving an undetectable PSA of  30% among patients treated 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. At least two patients with an undetectable PSA 
will be required in the first [ADDRESS_1033030] achieved 
an undetectable PSA at 6 months, the study will be considered 
successful and the regimen worthy of further investigation.  This 
design has a type I error rate of 0.05 and a type II error rate of 
0.20.  
Demographic and cli nical characteristics will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics (e.g. proportions, mean, standard 
deviation, median, range).  The proportion of patients who 
achieve an undetectable PSA (≤0.2 ng/ml) after initiation of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754646] 95% 
confidence interval.  The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to 
estimate time to PSA progression, time to disease progression by 
[CONTACT_754719].  In evaluation of 
time to PSA progression and time to diseas e progression by [CONTACT_754720]: (1) lost to follow -up at the date of 
last contact, (2) use of additional cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_754647] (3) death 
from causes other than prostate cance r or treatment of prostate 
cancer. Evaluation of time to death will be censored for lost to 
follow -up at last contact.  
The effects of IRAEs and other immune parameters (e.g., a ratio 
of T regulatory cells to T effector cells) on clinical outcomes will 
be evaluated using logistic regression for binary endpoints (e.g., 
achievement of undetectable PSA) and Cox regression for the 
time to event outcomes (e.g., time to PSA progression).

men.1 Also, an estimated 192,280  men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and around 
7,700 of those men had incurable disease (i.e., metastatic) at diagnosis.1 Androgen 
suppression therapy (AST) is the most effective systemic therapy for these patients with 
incurable prostate cancer. Cur rently, the most promising approach to extending survival 
and protecting quality of life in these men is to identify ways to enhance the depth and 
duration of response to AST.

Hussain and colleagues were able to discriminate between men at high and low risk of 
dying from castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) at a point in the disease process 
when the disease burde n is minimal. This discovery creates a novel opportunity to target 
this minimal volume androgen -independent disease early with the hope of altering the 
grim natural history of this disease state.  Hussain’s data also demonstrate that a complete 
PSA respons e to initial therapy is likely a pre -requisite for long -term survival.  
 
An emerging class of agents that target immune functions has shown promise in treating 
advanced prostate cancer. It is believed that cancer cells can evade immune detection by

Template updated 30 May 2014  12  interac ting with the CTLA -4 receptor on the T cells. This interaction downregulates the 
immune response, thus allowing cancer cells to escape detection.3 Immunotherapy with 
anti-CTLA antibody (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) shows promise in Phase I studies of men with CRPC 
who have  progressed through current therapeutic options.[ADDRESS_1033033] had confirmed PSA responses (PSA decrease of 50% or greater from

names of these antigens are not specifically outlined because they are proprietary at this

1.2.[ADDRESS_1033036] Protocol Shell, Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033037] 
allowed the rational design of new strategies for immunotherapy of t umors, including 
melanoma. It has been known for some time that engagement of the T cell antigen 
receptor by [CONTACT_485349] T cell activation; a second co -stimulatory signal 
is required for induction of IL -2 production, proliferation and  differentiation to effector 
function of naive T cells. Abundant data now indicate that the primary source of this 
costimulation is mediated by [CONTACT_485350]28 on the T cell surface by [CONTACT_754721] B7 family on the antigen -presenting cell (APC).5 (See Figure 1.)  
Expression of B7 has been shown to be limited to “professional” antigen presenting cells; 
that is, specialized cells of the hematopoietic lineage, including dendritic cells, activated 
macrophages, and activated B cells. It has been suggested th at this sharply -defined 
restriction of B7 expression is a fail -safe mechanism for maintenance of peripheral T cell 
tolerance, insuring that T cell activation can only be stimulated by [CONTACT_485351].[ADDRESS_1033038] in pursuing this as  an approach to tumor immunotherapy. As 
demonstrated in vivo  in murine tumor models, the utility of B7 expression as a 
vaccination approach is limited by [CONTACT_15006]: (1) B7 -expressing tumor cell 
vaccines are only effective when the tumor cells h ave a high degree of inherent 
immunogenicity; (2) while B7 -expressing vaccines have been shown in many cases to be 
effective in inducing protective immune responses, they have demonstrated only limited 
utility in inducing responses to established tumors; a nd (3) inactivation of tumor cells by 
[CONTACT_665467] -enhancing activity of the B7 gene 
product.9,[ADDRESS_1033039] few years it has become apparent that co -stimulation is even more complex 
than originally thought. After activat ion, T cells express CTLA -4, a close homologue to 
CD28. CTLA -4 binds members of the B7 family with a much higher affinity than 
CD28.11Although there was initially some controversy as to the role of CTLA -4 in 
regulating T cell activation, it has become clear  that CTLA -4 down -regulates T cell 
responses.12 This was initially suggested by [CONTACT_485353]: 
(1) blockade of CTLA -4/B7 interactions with antibody enhanced T cell responses; 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  14  (2) cross -linking of CTLA -4 with CD3 and CD28 inhibited T ce ll responses; and 
(3) administration of antibodies to CTLA -[ADDRESS_1033040] spontaneously activated  T cells evident at approximately 1 week after birth, 
followed by [CONTACT_386]. These mice die at 
approximately 3 weeks of age, either as a result of polyclonal T cell expansion and tissue 
destruction or as a result of to xic shock resulting from lymphokine production by [CONTACT_941] 
T cells. Since thymocyte differentiation and selection proceed normally in 
CTLA -4-deficient mice, the rampant T cell expansion that occurs in the mice indicates 
that CTLA -4 plays a critical role in down -regulating T cell responses in the periphery.16 
1.3 Summary of Results of Investigational Program  
1.3.1 Pharmacology of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485247] a human immunoglobulin G (IgG1)κ anti -CTLA -4 monoclonal antibody

prima tes including cynomolgus monkeys.  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79229] a hybridoma clone. Subsequently, 
a transfectoma (CHO cell) has been generated that is capable of producing more 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79230] a per cell basis than the hybridoma. Materi al from the transfectoma will 
be utilized in this and future ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79257]. Biochemical, immunologic and 
in vivo preclinical primate assessments demonstrated similarity between hybridoma and 
transfectoma -derived ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
1.3.2 Pre-Clinical Toxic ology of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754648] -clinical toxicology studies can be found in the 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_121002] (IB). Non -clinical toxicity assessments included in

Template updated 30 May 2014  15  cellular cytotoxicity (CDCC) or antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and 
toxicology assessments in cynomolgus monkeys alone and in the presence of vaccines.  
The in vitro  studies demonstrated that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_485251] - or 
(CD)3 -activated human T cells. However, low to moderate ADCC activity was noted at 
concentrations up to 50 ug/mL. These data are consistent with the requirement of high 
levels of antigen expression on the surface of target cells for efficient ADCC or CDCC. 
Since ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a human IgG1, an isotype generally capable of mediating CDCC and 
ADCC, the lack of these activities is likely due to a very low expression of CTLA -[ADDRESS_1033042] that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754649] T cells in vivo . Indeed, no depletion of T cells or T cell 
subsets were noted in toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys.  
No mortality or signs of toxicity were observed in three independent 14 -day intravenous 
toxic ology studies in cynomolgus monkeys at multiple doses up to 30  mg/kg/dose. 
Furthermore, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754650] B (HepB) Vaccine and Melanoma 
Vaccine. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b was well tolerated alone or in combination in all studies. There 
were no significant changes in clinical signs, body weight values, clinical pathology 
values or T cell activation markers. In addition, there were no significant histopathology 
changes in t he stomach or colon.  
1.3.3 Human Pharmacokinetics of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754651] (PK) profiles for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_561583]. The primary objective 
of Protocol MDX010 -015 was to determine the safety and PK profile of single and 
multiple doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754652] a transfectoma or hybridoma cell line. Mean 
plasma concentrations of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_561585] 3  mg/kg (hybridoma -
derived drug product); 2.8  mg/kg, 5  mg/kg, 7.5  mg/kg, 10  mg/kg, 15  mg/kg, and 
20 mg/kg (transfectoma -derived drug product ) demonstrated approximate dose 
proportionality. Equimolar doses of hybridoma -derived and transfectoma -derived drug 
product had comparable PK profiles. The range of mean volume of distribution at steady 
state (Vss) across cohorts 2.8, 3, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, an d 20 mg/kg, was 57.3 to 82.6  mL/kg, 
indicating drug distribution was mostly limited to the intravascular space. The clearance 
was low (range 0.11 to 0.29  mL/h/kg) and reflective of the half -life (range 297 to 414  h), 
which is consistent with the long termi nal disposition phase of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. There was 
moderate variability in the PK parameters among subjects, with CV of 11% to 48% in 
AUC(0 -21d), 20% to 59% in CL, and 17% to 46% in Vss.

Template updated 30 May 2014  16  1.3.4 Clinical Safety with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754653] -approved in patients with unresectable 
advanced melanoma (unresectable Stage III or Stage IV).  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_561588] 2633 patients with different cancers 
in 24 completed or ongoing clinical trials as of 31 -Mar-2008 with a dose range between 
0.3 mg/kg and 20  mg/kg. Most experience with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79233] 3  mg/kg and 
10 mg/kg dose levels. Patients who received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3  mg/kg were treated in 
clinical studies conducted early in the development program and received eithe r a single 
or multiple injections. Intra -patient dose escalation indicated that patients who were 
unresponsive at the 3  mg/kg dose level may have responded to 9  mg/kg. Based on 
preliminary data on the 10  mg/kg dose level of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the ongoing clinical  program 
investigating ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754654] 10  mg/kg dose level with 
the expectation that 10  mg/kg will prove more beneficial than 3  mg/kg.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Details of Drug -Related Adverse Events  
Drug -related adverse events (AEs) were reported in studies with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754655], cytokines or 
chemotherapy. The AE profile of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79236], with most 
drug-related AEs being immune -related adverse events (IRAEs), which are considered to 
be associated with the mechanism of action of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The most common IRAEs are 
colitis and diarrhea, rash, pruritis, deficiencies of endocrine organs (pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], adrenal or 
thyroid), hepatitis, and uveitis. Rare complications are bow el perforations (~1%) 
resulting from underlying severe colitis, which have required surgical intervention.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug -Related Serious Adverse Events  
Drug -related Grade  3 or Grade  4 serious adverse events (SAEs) include: 
rash/desquamation, pruritus, uveitis, spee ch impairment, abdominal pain, diarrhea/colitis, 
nausea/vomiting, transaminase elevation, adrenal insufficiency, panhypopi[INVESTIGATOR_754656]. Some of these events, such as rash/desquamation, pruritus, uveitis, 
diarrhea/colitis, transaminase elevation, adrenal insufficiency and panhypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], 
may represent drug induced IRAEs (see Section 4.3.4). Refer to the most recent version 
of the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754657].  
Among subjects treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10  mg/kg, SAEs considered possibly, probably, 
or definitely related to study drug were reported for 26% of subjects (176/675). Drug 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033043] 1% of the 675 subjects at 10 mg/kg included diarrhea 
(10%), colitis (7%), vomiting (3%), deh ydration (3%), autoimmune hepatitis (2%), 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297] (2%), nausea (2%), abdominal pain (2%), pyrexia (2%), aspartate 
aminotransferase increased (1%), alanine aminotransferase increased (1%), and fatigue 
(1%).  
1.3.5 Immune -Related Adverse Events ( IRAEs ) with  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754658] a consequence of the intrinsic biological activity of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. An 
IRAE is defined as any adverse event associated with drug exposure and consi stent with 
an immune -mediated event. Disease progression, infections and other etiologic causes are 
ruled out or deemed unlikely as contributing to the event. Supportive data, such as 
autoimmune serology tests or biopsies, are helpful but not necessary to deem an event an 
IRAE. Events of unclear etiology which were plausibly “immune -mediated” have been 
conservatively categorized as IRAEs even if serologic or histopathology data are absent. 
These IRAEs likely reflect a loss of tolerance to some self antigens  or an unchecked 
immune response to gut or skin flora. Some breakthrough of immunity may be 
inseparably linked to the clinical antitumor activity of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
Approximately 60% of subjects developed any grade IRAEs which involved 
predominately the gastro intestinal (GI) tract, endocrine glands, liver, or skin. Based on 
data from the safety database, the number of subjects with serious IRAEs was 
approximately 15% (401/2633), including 8.2% for serious GI IRAEs (diarrhea and/or 
colitis), 2.2% of serious endo crinopathy (primarily hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297]), 2% of 
pericarditis and <1% of serious skin IRAEs. Bowel perforation was reported in 
approximately 1% of subjects. With few exceptions these IRAEs were clinically 
manageable and reversible with supportive  care or corticosteroids. In responding patients, 
addition of corticosteroids does not appear to have a temporal relationship to change in 
objective tumor response.  
Additionally, as of February 2006, there has been observation from a National Cancer 
Instit ute (NCI) study of bowel wall perforation in some patients who were administered a 
high-dose IL -[ADDRESS_1033044] dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] > [ADDRESS_1033045] Protocol Shell, Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  18  related diarrhea or colitis and the symptoms had completely resolved prior to IL -2 
administration. One patient did not experience ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -related diarrhea. It is unknown 
whether this observation represents a true association or is mechanistically u nrelated to 
prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_561598].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug -Related Deaths  
Based on reports from the safety data base as of June  30, 2008, there have been reports of 
death (approximately 1% [28/3000]), deemed by [CONTACT_754722] o f study drug. The most common cause of drug related deaths was GI 
perforation. Other causes included multiorgan failure, sepsis, hypotension, acidosis, and 
adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]. For details on all drug -related deaths, refer to the 
current ve rsion of the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_121002].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety of 10  mg/kg Multiple Doses  
Based on a review of the program -wide SAE data as previously reported, evidence had 
suggested that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -associated IRAEs were dose dependent in frequency, and 
higher IRA E rates had been observed at 10  mg/kg than at lower doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. 
Subsequently, this dose -dependent effect was further demonstrated in CA184 -022 in 
which three dose levels of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754659], including 
0.3 vs 3 vs 1 0 mg/kg. Table  [ADDRESS_1033046] Protocol Shell, Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  19  Qualitatively, the safety profile of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 10  mg/kg remains consistent with the 
low-dose safety profile in that most of the drug -related SAEs are characteristic of 
immune -related toxicity, and most of the IRA Es are reported in the GI, hepatic, and 
endocrine systems. However, the data presented in Table  [ADDRESS_1033047] that the frequency of 
IRAEs in association with 10  mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754660].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Neuropathies  
Isolated cases of motor neuropathy of an autoimmune origin have been reported among 
patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Two cases have been diagnosed as Guillain -Barre 
syndrome (GBS), only one of which was considered study related. As of July  2, 2008,

Based on a preliminary analysis for study MDX010 -15 involving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10  mg/kg 
multiple doses, 34.8% of patients (N  = 23) were progression -free at 6  months and about 
17.4% were progression -free at 1  year. In comparison, for Study MDX010 -08 involving 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3  mg/kg multiple doses, 10.8% patients (N  = 37) had progression -free 
survival at 6  months and 8.4% at 1  year. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754661] (dacarbazine), melanoma vaccines (gp100), and

The clinical benefit of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754662]. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_754663] 14 prostate cancer patients with bone metastases and 
varying prior treatment regimens of their prostate cancer.[Small, Clin Cancer Res, 2007]. 
Half had already received chemotherapy prior to enrollment in the trial. Four patients also 
had soft tissue d isease. Each patient received a single dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 3 mg/kg IV. 
Two patients had a PSA decline of ≥ 50%, and each of those patients elected to receive a 
second dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg IV. Neither of those patients had soft tissue lesions 
that cou ld be measured by [CONTACT_13407]. Their PSA responses lasted for 135 and 60 
days, respectively.  
More recently, 45 patients with metastatic, castration -resistant prostate cancer were given 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg every three weeks for four doses.[ADDRESS_1033051] dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Of these 29 
patients, 14 had no exposure to chemotherapy prior to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777], and 15 had 
received chemotherapy prior to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777]. The use of chemotherapy was 
historical, and not part of this study. The patients with a PSA decline of ≥ 50% were 
more likely to be chemotherapy naïve. The results are in Table 2. Importantly, response

[IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship Between Response and Immune Breakthrough Events in 
Patients with Metastatic Melanoma and Prostate Cancer  
Drug -related AEs of any grade considered to be immune -mediated in nature (IRAEs) 
were reported for 54.0% of subjects in clinical studies of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. These I RAEs are a 
consequence of inhibiting CTLA -[ADDRESS_1033052] were reported as Grade 1 or 2. An 
association between BORR and higher grade (Grade 3 -4) IRAEs was suggested in early 
studies of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg but this association was not observed in 4 Phas e 2 studies 
of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (CA184022, CA184008, CA184007 and CA184004). There were 
proportionally more subjects with IRAEs of any grade who experienced response or 
stable disease than subjects without IRAEs who experienced response or stable disease, 
but du e to the small sample sizes, these observations were statistically 
inconclusive.21,22,23 
1.4 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment melanoma and prostate 
cancer  
Results from the [ADDRESS_1033053] that the 10 mg/kg dose 
is active and offers  the best benefit to risk ratio based on a 27.1% to 35.1% rate of disease 
control and a favorable 1 -year survival rate of 48.6% to 59.1% compared with that 
reported in the literature (25.5% to 35%) .24,25,26,27 Substantial reductions in total tumor 
burden, incl uding widely disseminated disease in the skin, lung, and/or other visceral 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033054] resistant to 
approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The kinetics of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754671] (CR, PR and SD) as well as novel patterns, characterized by [CONTACT_754723], including existing and new lesions, after initial tumor volume increase 
and/or after a ppearance of new lesions. In the pretreated population at 10 mg/kg in 2 of 
the 3 studies, disease control after initial tumor volume increase and/or new lesions was 
reported for 9.7% of subjects. Across all 3 studies, stable disease was often accompanied 
by [CONTACT_754724]. All patterns of 
response, including SD, appeared to result in favorable survival, based on 1 -year survival 
rates.  
Characteristic organ -specific inflammatory IRAEs were reported with ipi [INVESTIGATOR_131590], typi[INVESTIGATOR_754672]. IRAEs were mostly reversible within days to 
weeks following cessation of therapy or treatment with symptomatic therapy, 
corticosteroids or other anti -inflammatory agents, depending upon severity. Accumul ated 
clinical experience resulted in detailed toxicity management guidelines (also termed 
algorithms), by [CONTACT_754725], especially when IRAEs 
are recognized early and subjects are treated in a timely fashion. This can minim ize the 
occurrence of IRAE complications, such as GI perforation/colectomy or hepatic failure.  
Treatment with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754673]. Clinically relevant reductions i n the tumor 
burden from baseline were reported, together with a preliminary evidence of improved 
overall survival compared with published survival rates. These findings, together with 
evidence of a safety profile that is manageable with careful monitoring and appropriate 
intervention for treatment of immune -related toxicities, suggest an acceptable benefit to 
risk ratio.  
Men with metastatic prostate cancer who do not obtain and maintain a complete 
biochemical response  (PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/ml) to AST alone have a very poor prognosis.2 The 
median survival of this study population is only 13 to 44 months, where a PSA > 4.0 
ng/ml after induction AST has the shortest median survival. Chemotherapy using 
docetaxel with prednisone is  currently an option for men with CRPC.  While there have 
been no direct comparisons of toxicity between ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754674], we anticipate 
that the overall toxicity of chemotherapy is greater.  Since the initial approval of this 
study, several other agents have gained approval in CRPC, namely abiraterone with 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033055] 
a significantly shortened median survival. Early immune -based therapy may delay 
disease progression and prolong survival in this subset of patients.  
 
The primary endpoint is the  fraction of patients who achieve an undetectable PSA (≤ 0.2 
ng/ml). The Hussain paper has shown that men who achieve and maintain an 
undetectable PSA have a significantly longer median survival.[ADDRESS_1033056] Protocol Shell, Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033057] four doses of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].

4.3 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan is outlined in a separate document and is NCI 
approved.  
5 STUDY THERAPY  
All patients will receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg IV over [ADDRESS_1033076] not progressed (radiographically) will 
also receive the same dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754677]. Each patient’s available lab results (i.e. chemistries and blood  counts) will be 
reviewed prior to each ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182] . 
5.1 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754678]  10 mg/kg IV over 90 minutes (not bolus or IV 
push).  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (BMS -734016) is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG1)κ anti -CTLA -4 
monoclonal antibody (mAb). In vitro studies were performed with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754679] -4, actively inhibits CTLA -[ADDRESS_1033077] 
with CTLA -4 in non -human primates, includi ng cynomolgus monkeys.  
5.1.1 Dose Calculations  
Dose calculations will be based on the weight obtained on Cycle 1 Day 1 and will only 
change if the weight increases or decreases by [CONTACT_726] 10%.  
Calculate Total Dose  as follows:  
 Patient body weight in kg x [10 m g] = total dose in mg  
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  31  Calculate Total Infusion Volume  as follows:  
 Total dose in mg ÷ 5 mg/mL = infusion volume in mL  
Calculate Rate of Infusion  as follows:  
 Infusion volume in mL ÷ 90 minutes = rate of infusion in mL/min.  
For example, a patient weighing 1 14 kg (250 lb) would be administered 1140 mg of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (114 kg x 10 mg/kg = 1140 mg) with an infusion volume of 228 mL (1140 
mg ÷ 5 mg/mL = 228 mL) at a rate of approximately 2.5 mL/min (228 mL ÷ 90 minutes) 
in 90 minutes.  
5.1.2 Storage, Preparation, and Adm inistration  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_597321], 50 mg/vial (5 mg/mL) or 200 mg/vial (5 mg/mL), must be stored 
refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) and protected from light. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754680]. Partially used vials or empty vials of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754681].  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404330] 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% 
Dextrose Injection, USP to concentrations between 1 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL and stored in 
PVC, non -PVC or  glass containers for up to 24 hours at 2 -8ºC or RT/RL.  
Recommended safety measures for preparation and handling include protective clothing, 
gloves, and safety cabinets.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Preparation and Administration Guidelines  
The supplies needed for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754682]. The product may be infused using a volumetric pump at 
the protocol -specific d ose(s) and rate(s) through a PVC IV solution infusion set with a 
0.2 μm or 1.2 μm in -line polyethersulfone or 1.2 μm positively charged nylon filter to 
complete the infusion in 90 minutes, with a 10 -mL normal saline flush at the completion 
of the infusion.  
 
1) As ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754683] (2 -8ºC), allow the appropriate 
number of vials of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754684].  
2) Aseptically withdraw the required volume of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404327] a syringe.  
Insert the needle at an angle into the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754685] – bevel 
side down – against the glass, with the tip touching the neck of the vial. The initial 
solution concentration is 5 mg/mL. [Note: A sufficient excess of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754686]].  
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  32  3) Ensure that the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404326], essentially free from particulate 
matter on visual inspection. If multiple vials are needed for a subject, it is important 
to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each vial to prevent problems such as 
dulling of needle tip, stopper coring, repeated friction of plunger against syringe 
barrel wall, etc.  
4) Inject ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754687] a final infusion volume that has been calculated from the weight of the 
patient. For example, if preparing a 10mg/kg treatment for a 65 kg patient you will 
use 13 vials (or 650 mg), the drug solution volume will be 10 mL per vial or 130 mL 
total.  
5) If the total dose calculates to less than 90 mL of solution then the total dose needed 
should be diluted to a total volume of 90 mL in 0.9% sodium chloride.  
6) Mix by [CONTACT_404357]. DO NOT shake.  
7) Visually inspect the final solution. If th e initial diluted solution or final dilution for 
infusion is not clear or contents appear to contain precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], the solution should be 
discarded.  
8) Do not draw into each vial more than once. Any partial vials should be safely 
discarded and should not be st ored for reuse.

5.1.6 Immune -Related Adverse Events (IRAEs): Definition, Monitoring, and 
Treatment  
Blocking CTLA -4 function may permit the emergence of auto -reactive T  cells and 
resultant clinical autoimmunity. Rash/vitiligo, diarrhea/colitis, uveitis/epi[INVESTIGATOR_227], 
hepatitis, and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_228] -related, presumptive autoimmune events, now 
termed IRAEs , noted in previous ipi[INVESTIGATOR_229].  
For the purposes of this study, a n IRAE is defined as an AE of unknown etiology 
associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune phenomenon. Efforts 
should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic

Template updated 30 May 2014  35  causes prior to labeling an AE an IRAE. Se rological, immunological, and histological 
(biopsy) data should be used to support the diagnosis of an immune -mediated toxicity. 
Suspected IRAEs must be documented on an AE or SAE form.  
Patients should be informed of and carefully monitored for evidence o f clinically 
significant systemic IRAE (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus -like diseases) or 
organ -specific IRAE (e.g., rash, colitis, uveitis, hepatitis or thyroid disease). If an IRAE 
is noted, appropriate work -up (including biopsy if possible) should be  performed, and 
steroid therapy may be considered if clinically necessary. See Appendix  [ADDRESS_1033081] been maintained in patients treated  
with corticosteroids and discontinued from ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. If utilized, corticosteroid therapy 
should be individualized for each patient. Prior experience suggests that colitis 
manifested as ≥  Grade [ADDRESS_1033082] Protocol Shell, Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  36  5.1.7 Other Guidance  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Immune -Related Adverse Events Considered to be Related to the 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754694] 74% (about 3 in 4) of treated patients develop a side 
effect of any grade of severity due to the immune system  attacking normal cells. About 
22% (about 1 in 4) of patients have a serious immune -related adverse event.  Serious side 
effects may be fatal or life -threatening, require you to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], may permanently 
disable you, make you weak and unable to func tion at your current level, or may put your 
health at risk or require surgery or intervention by [CONTACT_6814].  
These immune -related side effects have usually been controlled by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_754695], with medications, includi ng steroids (medications 
that are used to decrease inflammation). If you develop an immune -related event, the 
symptoms may take several months to improve. These immune -related adverse events 
can relate to: Stomach/Intestine, Rash, Eye, Endocrine Glands, Li ver, Other Organs, 
Meningitis, immune -related motor neuropathy, nephritis, skin disorders and joint pain.  
Patients receiving the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754696] a serious skin toxicity, though 
this is very rare.  If a patient develops a skin toxicity, a bi opsy is recommended.  If a 
biopsy is done, a portion of it may be sent to an independent doctor for review.  
While receiving treatment with the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], patients may be at risk of side effects 
(such as fever, low blood pressure, chills, flushing, nausea and/or vomiting) that occur 
during or shortly after the infusion (within 24 hours). If these events occur during the 
infusion, they may be treated by [CONTACT_125568][INVESTIGATOR_51119], or with treatment such 
as fluids given into your vein or other common me dications. These events can also occur 
hours after the completion of the infusion.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment of Infusion Reactions Associated with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754697], it is less likely that any allergic 
reaction will be seen in patients. However,  it is possible that infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754698] a cytokine release syndrome that could be evidenced by [CONTACT_411], chills, rigors, rash, 
pruritus, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms. No prophylactic 
pre-medication will be given u nless indicated by [CONTACT_583041]. Reactions should be treated based upon the following recommendations.  
 For mild symptoms (e.g., localized cutaneous reactions such as mild pruritus, 
flushing, rash):  
 Decrease  the rate of infus ion until recovery from symptoms, remain at bedside 
and monitor patient.

 Diphenhydramine  50 mg IV may be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician and patients may receive additio nal doses with close monitoring.  
 Premedication  with diphenhydramine may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator for subsequent doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 For moderate symptoms (any symptom not listed above [mild symptoms] or below 
[severe symptoms] such a s generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, hypotension 
with systolic BP >80  mmHg):  
 Interrupt  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 Administer  diphenhydramine 50  mg IV.  
 Monitor  patient closely until resolution of symptoms.  
 Corticosteroids  may abrogate any beneficial immunolog ic effect, but may be 
administered at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 Resume  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_234].  
 At the discretion  of the treating physician, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754699], th en increased incrementally to the initial 
infusion rate.  
 If symptoms  develop after resumption of the infusion, the infusion should be 
discontinued and no additional ipi[INVESTIGATOR_236].  
 The next dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754700] d at its next scheduled time and 
may be given with pre -medication (diphenhydramine and acetaminophen) and 
careful monitoring, following the same treatment guidelines outlined above.  
 At the discretion  of the treating physician additional oral or IV antihist amine may 
be administered prior to dosing with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 For severe symptoms (e.g., any reaction such as bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, 
systolic blood pressure 80 mm Hg, or angioedema):  
 Immediately discontinue infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and disconnect infusion tubing 
from the subject.  
 Consider  bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1  mg IV or subcutaneously, and/or 
diphenhydramine 50  mg IV, with solumedrol 100  mg IV, as need ed. 
 Patients  should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the 
symptoms will not recur.  
 No further  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_239].  
 In case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance within one 
week after treatment of a localized or generalized pruritus), symptomatic treatment 
may be given (e.g., oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).

Template updated 30 May 2014  38  [IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -Related Isolated Drug Fever  
In the event of isolated drug fever, the investigator must use clinical judgment to 
determine if the fever is related to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_241]. If a patient 
experiences isolated drug fever, for the next dose, pre -treatment with acetaminophen or 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory agent (investigator discretion) should be instituted and a 
repeated antipyretic dose at 6 and 12 hours after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182], should be 
administered. The infusion rate will remain unchanged for future doses. If a patient 
experiences recurrent isolated drug fever following premedication and pos t dosing with 
an appropriate antipyretic, the infusion rate for subsequent dosing should be decreased to 
50% of the previous rate. If fever recurs following infusion rate change, the investigator 
should assess the patient’s level of discomfort with the eve nt and use clinical judgment to 
determine if the patient should receive further ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
5.2 Prohibited and Restricted Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_239981]  
5.2.1 Prohibited Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_485333] a component of the protocol regimen (including those for 
common medical conditions) for up to one month pre and post dosing with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. 
Concomitant systemic or local anti -cancer medications or treatments are prohibited in

6.3.1 Study Materials  
Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) will provide ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665343].  
6.3.[ADDRESS_1033089], 
up to and including fo llow-up visits will be reported. See Section 8: Adverse Event 
Reporting.  
Safety will be evaluated for all treated patients using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  4.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse 
event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, physical examinations, and 
clinical laboratory tests.  
6.4 Criteria for Evaluation  
6.4.1 Safety Evaluation  
Refer to the NCI CTCAE, Version  4.0 ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). SAEs will be assessed 
every three weeks during the first four cycles of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754701] [ADDRESS_1033090] Protocol Shell, Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  43  6.4.2 Efficacy Evaluation  
The primary endpoi nt is fraction of patients who achieve an undetectable PSA (≤ 0.2 
ng/ml). Pursuant to that endpoint, we will check the PSA every [ADDRESS_1033091] 4 
cycles and every 6 weeks during weeks 12 -24, then every three months as the patient is 
being followe d (planned follow up through year 5).  
 
The secondary endpoints  explore the objective responses achieved in the realm of non -
progression of disease and tumor regression, as well as provide an opportunity to learn 
more about the immune response itself. Part of this assessment is PSA -based and part is 
based on radiographs (bone scans and CT scans). We will use the procedures described 
for the primary endpoint, above, to look at response endpoints. Additionally, a CT scan of 
the chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone sc an at baseline, week 12, week [ADDRESS_1033092] blood samples pri or to each infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754702]. Once the study is complete, we will compare the objective response with the 
depth of the immune response.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions of PSA -Related Secondary Endpoints  
PSA progression : PSA increase of ≥  25% and at least 2 ng/mL from baseline or nadir 
PSA achieved, confirmed by a second measurement at least three weeks later.  
PSA nadir : Lowest PSA reached that was confirmed by a second equal or lower 
measurement.  
 
PSA response : As recommended by [CONTACT_338532]2  definitions. We will not apply a strict 
definition for PSA response. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a 
PSA < 0.2 ng/ml on this study. Waterfall plots will be used to describe PSA changes 
while on study.  
Maximum percentage of PSA re duction in each patient.  Percentage of PSA reduction 
will be defined as [1 - (lowest PSA attained on study)/(PSA at study entry)] x 100. This 
formula only applies to PSAs that have decreased, and not those that have remained 
constant, i.e. the same as the baseline measurement.

Clinical Trials Working Group’s 2007 definitions (PCWG2).28 
The PCWG2 definitions use modified RECIS T criteria.  
Measurable lesions are visceral or extranodal lesions that are ≥ 1 cm in one direction. 
Lymph nodes are measurable lesions if they are ≥ 2 cm in one direction. Tumor in the 
prostate may also be used as a measurable lesion.  
Non-measurable lesion s are those lesions that do not meet the size criteria given above. 
Other non -measurable lesions are cysts, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions and lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis.  
Bone lesions will not be considered measurable lesio ns. 
All measurable and non -measurable lesions should be measured at Screening and at the 
defined tumor assessment time points.  Extra assessments may be performed , as clinically 
indicated, if there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_55519].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Index /Non -Index Lesions  
All measurable lesions, up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and ten lesions in 
total, should be identified as index  lesions to be measured and recorded on the medical 
record at Screening. The index  lesions should be representative of all involved organs. In 
addition, index  lesions should be selected based on their size (lesions with the longest 
diameters), their suitability for accurate repeat assessment by [CONTACT_15218], and 
how representative they are of the patient’s tumor b urden. At Screening, a sum of the 
longest  diameters for all index  lesions will be calculated and considered the baseline sum 
of the longest  diameters. Response criteria to be followed are listed below. The baseline 
sum will be used as the reference point t o determine the objective tumor response of the 
index lesions at tumor assessment (TA).  
 
Measurable lesions, other than index  lesions, and all sites of non -measurable disease, will 
be identified as non-index  lesions. Non-index  lesions will be recorded on t he medical 
record and should be evaluated at the same assessment time points as the index  lesions. In 
subsequent assessments, non-index  lesions will be recorded as “stable or decreased 
disease”, “absent”, or “progression”.  
 
 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033093] Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Index Lesion Response Using mRECIST  
* Complete 
Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
* Partial Response 
(PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline s um LD  
* Progressive 
Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started or the appearance of one or more new 
lesions  
* Stable Disease 
(SD):  Neither suf ficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
LD since the treatment started  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Non -Index Lesion Response Using mRECIST  
* Complete 
Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level. Must be confirmed by a scan done within 
4-[ADDRESS_1033094] scan.  
* Incomplete 
Response/Stable 
Disease (SD):  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/and 
maintenance of tumor marker  level above the normal limits  
* Progressive 
Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions*

Evaluation of Bone Lesions:  
For bone lesions, a minimum of two new lesions must be seen on bone scan to  be 
determined progression of disease. Any lesion on bone scan suspected to be flare or 
inflammation, another study (such as CT or MRI scan) should be done to document the

recommendation s. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Determination of Overall Response Using mRECIST  
Overall Response (OR) is determined as the combination of assessments of index  and 
non-index  lesions using the following criteria:  
Index Lesion 
Assessment  Non-Index Lesion 
Assessment  New Lesions  Overall Response  
CR CR No CR 
CR SD No PR 
PR CR or SD  No PR 
SD CR or SD  No SD 
PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any  PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
Best OR is the best confirmed response designation over the study as a whole, recorded 
between the date of first dose until  the last tumor assessment for the individual patient in 
the study. The assessment of response will be at [ADDRESS_1033095] be 
confirmed by a second (confirmatory) evaluation meeting the criteria for response 
and performed no less than [ADDRESS_1033096], abdomen and pelvis is required at screening (i.e., baseline) and at 
each tumor assessment visit, regardless of the location of known metastases. Specifically, 
a CT scan of the chest, abdomen an d pelvis will be done at baseline, [ADDRESS_1033097] Protocol Shell, Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  47  and during subsequent tumor assessm ents. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to 
clinical examination.  
If progressive disease is assessed based only on a new lesion(s) found on bone scans, 
additional imaging studies of the lesion(s) should be performed to confirm the malignant 
nature of th e new findings on the bone scan. Increased intensity of uptake in previously 
abnormal areas on bone scans is not considered progressive disease, unless the lesions 
seen on the correlative imaging studies performed of this area meet the criteria for 
progres sion. New areas of abnormal uptake on a bone scan represent progressive disease.

7 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
7.1 Collection of Safety Information  
The OHSU IRB defines an Unanticipated Problem (UP) as an event that is not expected 
given the nature of the research procedures and the patient population being studied and 
suggests that the research places patients or others at a greater risk of harm or discomfort 
related to the research than was previously known or recognized. Harm to a patient need 
not occur for an event to be a UP.  
Reportable Adverse Event – AEs which qualify as unanticipated problems that must be 
reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_754707]:  
 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  51   On Protocol Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that are unexpected and 
related or possibly related to participation in the research.  
 On Protocol SAEs or AEs that are expected in some patients, are  related or 
possibly related, but are determined to be occurring at a significantly 
higher frequency or severity than expected.  
 On or Off Protocol Unexpected SAEs or AEs that are related or possibly 
related, regardless of severity, that may alter the IRB’ s analysis of the risk 
versus potential benefit of the research and, as a result, warrant 
consideration of substantive changes in the research protocol or informed 
consent process/document.  
Other events that are On or Off Protocol and unexpected that may place patients or others 
at a greater risk of harm or discomfort than was previously known or recognized. Harm to 
a patient need not have occurred.  
All Reportable Adverse Events, as defined in this section occurring after patient 
enrollment must be reporte d to the Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_754740] at 
[PHONE_15720], extension [ZIP_CODE], or [EMAIL_10028] . The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_754708], OHSU IRB, Brist ol-
Myers Squibb, and other participating sites in accordance with the following guidelines.  
 
7.1.1 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose :  
 results in death  
 is life -threatening (defined as an even t in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] 
(see “note” below for exceptions)  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious 
 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  52  outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such event s include, but are not 
limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
 Although overdose and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_754729], these 
events should be reported on an SAE form and sent to BMS in an expedited manner. 
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional ingestion or infusion of any 
dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important.  
NOTE: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]:  
 a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_561659] 24  hours that 
does not result in admission (unless considered an “important medical event” or a 
life-threatening event)  
 elective surgery, planned before signing consent  
 admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
 routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)  
 medi cal/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state and was 
planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these 
cases  
 admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on heal th 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, care -giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative).  
Note that all pregnancies, regardless of outcome, must be reported to the sponsor on a 
Pregnancy S urveillance Form, not an SAE form. All pregnancies must be reported and  
followed to outcome, including pregnancies that occur in the female partner of a male 
study subject.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1033108]  
All adverse events, including those that are serious, will be graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI  CTCAE), 
Version  4.0. 
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship to investigational product 
as determined by a physician should be used for adverse events:  
 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  53   Certain: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
and the AE. The event responds to withdrawal of investigational product 
(dechallenge), and recurs with rechallenge when clinically feasible.  
 Probable: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational 
product and the AE. The event responds to d echallenge. Rechallenge is not required.  
 Possible: There is reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
and the AE. Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear.  
 Not likely: There is a temporal relationship to investigational produc t administration, 
but there is not a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
and the AE.  
 Not Related: There is not a temporal relationship to investigational product 
administration (too early, or late, or investigational product not taken), or there is a 
reasonable causal relationship between noninvestigational product, concurrent 
disease, or circumstance and the AE.  
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there 
are facts (eg, evidence su ch as de -challenge/re -challenge) or other arguments to suggest a 
positive causal relationship.  
7.[ADDRESS_1033109]. (In ord er to prevent reporting bias, subjects 
should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)  
If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather 
than its individual symptoms. The following info rmation should be captured for all AEs: 
onset, duration, intensity, seriousness, relationship to investigational product, action 
taken, and treatment required. If treatment for the AE was administered, it should be 
recorded in the medical record.  
The inves tigator shall supply the sponsor and Ethics Committee with any additional 
requested information, notably for reported deaths of subjects.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_1033110]’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs must be 
collected , including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. 
All SAEs must be collected that occur within [ADDRESS_1033111] be collected that relate to any later 
protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy). The investigator should notify 
 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033112] be immediately reported 
to BMS (by [CONTACT_1719]) within [ADDRESS_1033113] be kept on file at the study site.  
 
Participating centers will notify the Lead Site, OHSU, of all SAEs within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event. Reporting will occur by [CONTACT_754730] 3500A with 
supporting docu mentation. OHSU will report this information to BMS and/or the FDA, 
as appropriate.   
 
All SAEs should be faxed or emailed to BMS at:  
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_9611] -Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number: 609 -818-3804  
Email: Worldwide.safety@bms. com 
For studies conducted under an Investigator IND , any event that is both serious and 
unexpected must be reported to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 7 
days (death or life -threatening event) or 15 days (all other SAEs) after the i nvestigator’s 
or institution’s initial receipt of the information. BMS will be provided with a 
simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed with the FDA. SAEs should be reported on 
the MedWatch Form 3500A, which can be accessed at:

Email: [EMAIL_178]  
Serious adverse events, whether related or unrelated to investigational product, must be 
recorded on the SAE pa ge and reported expeditiously to BMS (or designee) to comply 
with regulatory requirements. An SAE report should be completed for any event where 
doubt exists regarding its status of seriousness .  
All SAEs must be immediately reported by [CONTACT_754731] (fax) and 
mailing of the completed SAE page. In some instances where a facsimile machine is not 
available, overnight express mail may be used. If only limited information is initially 
available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up SAE reports should include 
the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) In selected circumstances, the protocol 
may specify conditions that require additional telephone reporting.  
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to the inve stigational product, but is 
potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy, 
or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the 
narrative section of the SAE page.  
If an ongoing SA E changes in its intensity or relationship to the investigational product, a 
follow -up SAE report should be sent immediately to the sponsor. As follow -up 
information becomes available it should be sent immediately using the same procedure 
used for transmit ting the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization.  
7.3.2 Handling of Expedited Safety Reports  
In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify investigators of all SAEs that are 
suspected (certainly, probably, or possib ly related to the investigational product) and 
unexpected (ie, not previously described in the Investigator Brochure). In the European 
Union (EU), an event meeting these criteria is termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). Investiga tor notification of these events will be in the form 
of an expedited safety report (ESR).  
Other important findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_460602]: 
increased frequency of a clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE considered 
associated with study procedures that could modify the conduct of the study, lack of 
 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033115] to study subjects, clinically significant safety 
finding from a nonclinical (eg, animal) study, important safety recommendations from a 
study data monitoring committee, or sponsor decision to end or temporarily halt a clinical 
study for safety reasons.  
Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the ESR with 
the Investigator Brochure. Where required by [CONTACT_754732] a central 
IRB/IEC for the study, the sponsor will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The 
investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The 
investigator should also comply with the IRB/I EC procedures for reporting any other 
safety information.  
In addition, suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or unexpected) shall 
be reported by [CONTACT_754733] (either as expedited and/or in aggregate reports).  
7.3.[ADDRESS_1033116] Protocol Shell, Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033117].  
8 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY  
8.1 Study Design  
This is a single arm phase II trial.  
8.2 Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
The primary endpoint is the achievement of an undetectable PSA def ined as P SA ≤ 0.2 
ng/mg after initiation of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224].  The secondary endpoints are:  time to PSA 
progression, time to disease progression by [CONTACT_79342], time to death from any cause, 
number of patients with immune related Adverse Events (IRAEs), correlat ion between 
IRAEs and clinical outcomes, and the ratio of T regulatory cells to T effector cells, and 
additional measures of immune responses.  
8.3 Sample Size Justification  
N=30 (for the final analysis, 10 for the intial analysis).  Using the Simon two -stage 
design for Phase II trials, the initial accrual will be 10 patients.  Assuming that 10% of 
patients receiving usual care will achieve an undetectable PSA (PSA ≤ 0.2)  without 
additional intervention, the trial has a 80% power to detect a rate of achieving an 
undetectable PSA of  30% among patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  At least two 
patients with an undetectable PSA will be required in the first [ADDRESS_1033118] achieved an undetectable 
PSA at 6 months, the study will be considered successful and t he regimen worthy of 
further investigation.  This design has a type I error rate of 0.05 and a type II error rate of 
0.20.  
8.4 Analysis Populations  
An Intention to Treat (ITT) population includes all patients who sign the consent and are 
assigned to a treatmen t regardless of the actual drug dose the patients receive.  Safety 
analysis population includes all patients who receive at least one drug dose.  Per Protocol 
 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: 17 March 2009  
Template updated 30 May 2014  58  Population includes those who receive the prescribed dose of the drug per protocol and 
excludes p atients who drop out of the study prematurely.  Whenever possible, we will use 
the ITT population to analyze the primary and secondary endpoints provided that their 
primary and secondary endpoints are measured.  As a secondary analysis, per protocol 
popula tion will be used for the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints.  Safety 
analysis population will be used to analyze safety and toxicity data.  
8.5 Statistical Analysis Plan  
Demographic and clinical characteristics will be summarized using descriptive  statistics (e.g. 
proportions, mean, standard deviation, median, range).  The proportion of patients who achieve 
an undetectable  PSA (≤ 0.2 ng/ml) after initiation of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754709] 95% confidence interval.    The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate time to 
PSA progression, time to disease progression by [CONTACT_754734] m any cause.  
In evaluation of time to PSA progression and time to disease progression by [CONTACT_754735]:  
 
1) lost to follow -up at the date of last contact  
2) use of additional cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_754710]  
3) death from a causes other than prostate cancer or treatment of prostate cancer.  
 
Evaluation of time to death will be censored for lost to follow -up at last contact.  
 
The effects of IRAEs and other immune parameters (e.g., a ratio of T reg ulatory cells to T 
effector cells) on clinical outcomes will be evaluated using logistic regression for binary 
endpoints (e.g., achievement of undetectable PSA) and Cox regression for the time to event 
outcomes (e.g., time to PSA progression).  
8.6 Safety Anal ysis 
All toxicity and safety data including immune related Adverse Events (IRAEs) will be 
tabulated for each treatment group and summarized according to major organ categories of the 
NCI CTCAE v 4.0.  
8.[ADDRESS_1033119] Protocol Shell, Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033120] be reviewed and approved in 
writing by [CONTACT_754736] 
(CRRC) and Institutional Review Boar d (IRB) at OHSU prior to any patient being 
registered on this study at OHSU.  In addition, the protocol and informed consent must be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_754737] (PCCTC) study befo re any patients may be registered from those 
individual institutions.  
 
Any modification of this protocol must be documented in the form of a protocol revision 
or amendment signed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_754711], bef ore the revision or amendment may be implemented. The only 
circumstance in which the amendment may be initiated without regulatory approval is for 
a change necessary to eliminate an apparent and immediate hazard to the patient. In that 
event, the investiga tor must notify the CRRC and IRB in writing within [ADDRESS_1033121] Protocol Shell, Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033122] be maintained according to sponsor or FDA requirements.  
9.4 Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as 
defined by [CONTACT_5787] (ICH) and in accordance with 
the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the United 
States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50).  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any 
amendments and the subject informed consent will receive Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_114601].  
All potential serious breaches must be reported to BMS immediately. A serious breach is 
a breach of  the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the 
protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental 
integrity of the subjects of the study or the scientific value of the study.  
Study pers onnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], 
training, and experience to perform their respective task(s). This study will not use the 
services of study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been 
scientif ic misconduct or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure, debarment).  
Systems with procedures that ensure the quality of every aspect of the study will be 
implemented.  
9.[ADDRESS_1033123]/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IRB/IEC)  
Before study initiation , the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment 
materials/process (e.g., advertisements), and any other written information to be provided 
to subjects. The inves tigator should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the 
 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754642], Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033124] labeling, information to be provided to subjects and any 
updates.  
The investigator should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other information 
(eg, expe dited safety reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures

An IRAE is defined as an adverse event of unknown etiology, assoc iated with drug 
exposure and is consistent with an immune phenomenon. Efforts should be made to rule 
out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes prior to labeling an 
adverse event a non -dermatologic, immune -mediated event. Serolo gical, immunological, 
and histological (biopsy) data should be used to support the diagnosis of an immune -
mediated toxicity. Documentation of test results should be included in the patient’s 
medical record.  
Gastrointestinal (diarrhea) and skin (rash) -related toxicities have been the most common 
IRAEs noted in prior studies with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Suggested work -up procedures for 
suspected IRAEs of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, skin, eye, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], and adrenal gland 
are listed below. When symptomatic therapy is inadequate or inappropriate, an IRAE 
should be treated with steroids followed by a slow taper.  
Gastrointestinal Tract:  Diarrhea (defined as either first watery stool, or increase in 
frequency 50% above baseline with urgency or nocturnal bowel movement, or bloody 
stool) should be further evaluated and infectious or alternate etiologies ruled out. Patients 
should be advised to inform the investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even if it is mild. An 
algorithm for working up patients with diarrhea or suspected  colitis is provided in 
Appendix  4. 
If the event is of significant duration or magnitude or is associated with signs of systemic 
inflammation or acute phase reactants (e.g., increased CRP or platelet count; or 
bandemia), it is recommended that sigmoidoscop y (or colonoscopy, if appropriate) with 
colonic biopsy with [ADDRESS_1033127] an opthomolog ical examination, including a slit -lamp 
exam, to rule out uveitis. Tests should also be performed for WBCs and for stool 
calprotectin.  
Patients with colitis should discontinue any non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medications 
or any other medications known t o exacerbate colitis symptoms. Investigators should use 
their clinical judgment as to whether corticosteroids are necessary to treat colitis 
associated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754712]. As guidance 
prior experience suggests that c olitis manifested as ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1033128] Protocol Shell, Version 7: [ADDRESS_1033129] one month in duration. Lower d oses of prednisone may be considered for less severe 
cases of colitis. It is suggested that prednisone (for oral administration) or solumedrol (for 
intravenous administration) be corticosteroid of choice in the treatment of colitis.  
Liver : Elevation of LF Ts  [ADDRESS_1033130] is appropriate for a suspected liver IRAE and a biopsy 
should be considered.  
Patients presenting with right upper -quadrant abdominal pain and/or unexplained nausea 
or vomiting should have LFTs performed immediately and reviewed before administering 
the nex t dose of study drug. Treating physicians should discuss, with the CRO Medical 
Monitor, unexplained increases in LFTs  3 fold from baseline prior to any additional 
study drug administration.  
Pancreas:  Symptoms of abdominal pain associated with elevations of amylase and 
lipase, suggestive of pancreatitis, may rarely be associated with anti -CTLA -4 monoclonal 
antibody administration. The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain should 
include pancreatitis. Appropriate workup should include serum amylase  and lipase tests.  
Skin : A dermatologist should evaluate persistent and/or severe rash or pruritus. A biopsy 
should be performed if appropriate and if possible, photos of the rash should also be 
obtained. Low -grade ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754713] (e.g., antihistamines). Topi[INVESTIGATOR_754714].  
Eye: An ophthalmologist should evaluate visual complaints with examination of the 
conjunctiva, anterior a nd posterior chambers and retina; visual field testing and an 
electroretinogram should also be performed. Patients with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754715].

Template updated 30 May 2014  66  Endocrine:  Patients with unexplained  symptoms such as fatigue, myalgias, impotence, 
mental status changes, or constipation should be investigated for the presence of thyroid, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_665392]. An endocrinologist should be consulted if an 
endocrinopathy is suspected. TSH and free T4 levels should be obtained to determine if 
thyroid abnormalities are present. TSH, prolactin and a morning cortisol level will help to 
differentiate primary adrenal insufficiency from primary pi[INVESTIGATOR_13002]. 
Appropriate hormone replacem ent therapy should be instituted if an endocrinopathy is 
documented.  
Suspected IRAEs should be documented in the patient’s medical record.

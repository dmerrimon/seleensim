Section 6.1.1 Adverse Events  
Revised text as shown ( bold is new text):  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational (medicinal) product  or other protocol imposed 
intervention, regardless of attribution.  
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that 
emerge during the protocol specified AE reporting 
period, including signs or symptoms associated 
with lung cancer that were not present before the 
AE reporting period (see  Section 6.2.1). 
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol
mandated interventions (eg, invasive procedures 
such as biopsies).  
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the 
condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_657137] -specified Revised text to be

Abnormal laboratory values  should not be reported as AEs; 
however, any considered clinically significant laboratory 
values (eg, causing withdrawal from study or any type of 
intervetions)  by [CONTACT_657138].  
Section 6.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period 
Revised text as shown ( bold is new text):  
After  the signing of  the ICF, all SAEs must be reported.  
After the first dose of study drug, all AEs, irrespective of 
seriousness, must be reported.  
For acalabrutinib, AE reporting, irrespective of 
seriousness, ends [ADDRESS_1225019] dose of study 
drug(s).  For pembrolizumab, all AEs must be reported 
through [ADDRESS_1225020] dose of pembrolizumab; 
any SAEs, or follow -up to a SAE, including death due to 
any cause other than progression of the cancer under 
study, must be reported through [ADDRESS_1225021] initiates a new anticancer therapy within the 
90 day posttreatment t imeframe.   
SAEs considered related to study drug(s) occurring after 
the end of the AE reporting period (as defined above) 
must be reported.   
If an SAE is present at the last study visit, the SAE should 
be followed to resolution or until the investigator 
assesses the subject as stable, or the subject is lost to 
follow -up or withdraws consent.  Resolution/stable means 
the subject has returned to baseline state of health or the 
investigator does not expect any further improvement or 
worsening of the event.  
 The AE reporting period for this study begins when the 
subject receives the first dose of study drug  and ends with the 
safety follow up visit unless a subject received a new 
anticancer therapy before the safety follow up visit.  An 
exception to this report ing period is any AE occurring due to a 
protocol defined screening procedure.  If  a fatal AE occurs 
beyond [ADDRESS_1225022] dose of acalabrutinib and/or 
pembrolizumab AND it is assessed by [CONTACT_657139]/or pembrolizumab it must be 
reported as an SAE. Revised to match recent

Protocol Number:  ACE-ST-007 
Study Drugs: Acalabrutinib ( also known as ACP -196) 
KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab)  
Protocol Title:  A Phase 2 Proof -of-Concept Study of the Combination of ACP- 196 
and Pembrolizumab in Subjects with Advanced Non- small Cell 
Lung Carcinoma  
Phase:  Phase 2  
Comparator:  KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab)  
Study Centers:  Up to 20  centers  in the [LOCATION_002] will participate on this 
protocol.  
Background and 
Rationale for Study  Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer mortality, causing approximately 1.59 million deaths worldwide each year ( World 
Health Organization 2014 ).  Approximately 80 % to 85% of cases 
are non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), comprised of 
adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma 
(Molina 2008 ).  Surgical resection is the most successful option for 
cure; however, close to 70% of patients with lung cancer present with inoperable locally advanced tumors or metastatic disease at 
the time of diagnosis.  Until recently, platinum -based 
chemotherapy had been widely accepted as standard of care in palliation for patients with advanced disease as well as adjuvant 
therapy for patients with resected stages IIA through IIIA NSCLC.  
However, toxicities are high and the overall 5 -year survival rate 
remains <  20%.  Programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) confers 
inhibitory signals to activated T cells through binding to the PD -1 
receptor.  Over half of  solid tumors (including lung cancer, 
melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and others) express PD- L1 in the tumor microenvironment, 
which results in immune tolerance and impaired immune response against the tumor .  Additionally, PD -L1 expression in the tumor 
microenvironment has been shown to be a poor prognostic factor in several cancers .  Targeting immune infiltrates and disrupting 
PD-[ADDRESS_1225040] a 21% response rate by [CONTACT_44852] ( RECIST ) v 1.1 i n patients with 
advanced NSCLC (26% for treatment naive and 20%  for previously 
treated; Garon 2014 ).  
Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are important in 
promoting tumor growth and metastases by [CONTACT_657142][INVESTIGATOR_018] -
mesenchymal transition, allowing tu mor invasion, and promoting

Date : 23 May 2016 
Protocol: ACE -ST-007 
 
 
 
Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 21 of 163 angiogenesis ( Condamine 2014 ).  Therefore, MDSCs can be a 
mechanism of resistance to anti- PD-1 therapy.   When used in 
combination with checkpoint inhibitors, agents that inhibit MDSCs 
can improve outcomes in murine models of metastatic disease 
(Kim 2014 ).  
Bruton tyrosine kinase ( BTK) is a non -receptor enzyme of the Tec 
kinase family that is expressed in B cells, myeloid cells, and mast 
cells, where it regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, 
apoptosis, and cell migration .  BTK inhibition leads to preferential 
differentiation of macrophages into M1 instead of immunosuppressive M2 macrophages; BTK inhibition thus 
decreases the tumor -associated macrophages that promote tumor 
invasion and metastasis.  
Acerta Pharma B V is developi[INVESTIGATOR_657097], an  orally 
administered , small -molecule  inhibitor of BTK.  A Phase 1 study of 
acalabrutinib in 60 subjects  with relapsed/refractory  chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia showed an overall response rate of 95%.  
Acalabrutinib monotherapy has shown robust antitumor activity in 
murine solid tumor models .  The ant itumor effect observed with 
acalabrutinib correlates with biomarkers of response similar to 
those reported for other immunomodulating agents such as 
inhibitors of CTLA- 4, PD -1 and PD-L1.  
To determine whether  there is potential synergy between BTK 
inhibition and PD- 1 blockade, Acerta has conducted a nonclinical 
study of acalabrutinib in combination with an anti- PD ligand 1 (anti -
PD-L1) antibody in an orthotopic colon cancer murine m odel.  
Treatment with anti -PD-L1 as a single agent reduced tumor 
growth , but tumor regression was not observed.  Howev er, 
combined anti- PD-L1 and acalabrutinib treatment showed a further 
reduction in t umor growth.  Specifically,  6 of 9 animals displayed 
tumor regression compared with no animals treated with 
anti-PD-L1 alone (Figure 1 -9).  These results suggest the 
combination t herapy of BTK inhibition an d PD -1 blockade leads to 
greater benefit compared with PD -1 blockade alone.  
This proof -of-concept study will  assess the clinical potential of  a 
targeted dual inhibition approach by [CONTACT_657143], 
pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics  (PK), and efficacy of 
acalabrutinib and pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced, 
previously treated NSCLC. 
Study Design:  This clinical trial is a Phase [ADDRESS_1225041]  recurrent or metastatic NSCLC .  
Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria for the study will be 
randomized 1:1 to one of the following arms:  
Arm 1:   Pembrolizumab 200 mg administered as an intravenous 
(IV) infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W)  
Arm 2:   Acalabrutinib 100 mg administered orally (PO) twice per 
day (BID) plus pembrolizumab [ADDRESS_1225042]: Acalabrutinib (ACP -196)

Protocol: ACE -ST-007 
 
 
 
Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 22 of 163 Although acalabrutinib  has not demonstrated any d ose-limiting 
toxicities  (DLTs)  to date , the safety of acalabrutinib in combination 
with pembrolizumab in this patient population needs to be 
assessed and standard DLT criteria will be applied to Arm [ADDRESS_1225043] been successfully randomized to the co mbination 
arm (Arm 2) and have been treated a minimum of 4 weeks.  
Enrollment will b e paused while the interim safety analysis occurs.   
If a DLT rate of < 33%  is observed in Arm 2 (ie, DLT review is 
cleared) , then randomization will continue to evaluate the objective 
response rates of pembrolizumab monotherapy and the 
combination of pembrolizumab and acalabrutinib (ie, up to 37  total 
subjects per arm) .  If a DLT rate of ≥ 33% is  observed in Arm 2 , 
then enrollment  (1:1) will continue until an additional 6 subjects are 
randomized to Arm 2, but with a reduced dose level for acalabrutinib (Level -1).  If the DLT review is cleared in those 
additional 6  subjects  in Arm 2 then continued enrollment will occur 
at Level -1 for the combination arm.  If a DLT rate of ≥ 33% is 
observed in Arm [ADDRESS_1225044] 
confirmed progress ive disease on the combination of 
pembrolizumab and acalabrutinib will discontinue study treatment  
while those with confirmed progressive disease in the 
pembrolizumab monotherapy arm will continue on pembrolizumab with the addition of acalabrutinib until a second disease 
progression  or intolerance to therapy .  For subjects who cross over 
to receive combination treatment, acalabrutinib treatment will begin at the next visit at which subjects are scheduled to receive 
pembrolizumab.  The immune- related response criteria (irRECIST; 
Appendix 8
) will be used to determine progression on this study.  
Pembrolizumab treatment can end for subjects with confirmed complete response (CR) if treatment has been administered for at 
least [ADDRESS_1225045] been 
administered after confirmation of CR.

cytotoxic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as pemetrexed, and molecularly targeted therapeutics for adenocarcinomas, such as next- generation small molecules targeting EGFR and 
ALK inhibitors, have decreased toxicities but have improved the survival rate for advanced and metastatic disease only marginally ( Katzel 2009 , Rosell 2009, Shaw 
2011).  Novel targeted approaches are still needed in the treatment of advanced 
NSCLC.  
1.2 PROGRAMMED DEATH LIGAND/RECEPTOR INTERACTI ONS IN 
NSCLC 
Several negative regulatory checkpoint molecules function to check overstimulation of immune responses and contribute to the maintenance of immune tolerance to self -
antigens  (McDermott 2013) .  These molecules include cytotoxic T -lymphocyte ant igen-4 
(CTLA -4) as well as the programmed death (PD) -1 receptor and its ligands (PD- L1 and 
PD-L2). CTLA -[ADDRESS_1225057], 
PD-1 is induced on T cells after activation in response to inflammatory signals and limits 
T-cell function at sites of infection or tumor in peripheral tissues.  As the T -cell response 
increases, these negative regulatory molecules are induced, limiti ng the magnitude and 
duration of the response to prevent healthy tissue damage.  Tumors are capable of 
exploiting the homeostatic mechanisms regulated by [CONTACT_876864], thus limiting immune destruction.  
Over half of solid tumors (including lung cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and others) express PD -L1 in the tumor

Protocol: ACE -ST-[ADDRESS_1225058] the tumor ( Zou 2006).  Additionally, PD- L1 expression in the tumor 
microenvironment has been shown to be a poor prognostic factor in several cancers (Pardoll 2012 ).  In a clinical study of the anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody, pembrolizumab, 
in subjects with advanced NSCLC (N=282), a 21%  ORR was observed by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 
(26% for treatment naive and 20% for previously treated) ( Garon 2014 ).  Pembrolizumab 
was well tolerated with few serious drug -related AEs.  
1.3 BRUTON TYROSINE KINA SE INHIBITION IN CAN CER  
Bruton tyrosine kinase ( BTK) is a non -receptor enzyme in the Tec kinase family that is 
expressed among cells of hematopoietic origin, including B cells, myeloid cells, mast cells and platelets, where it regulates multiple cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell migrat ion (Khan  2001, Mohamed 2009 , Bradshaw 
2010) .  In addition, BTK-dependent activation of mast cells, myeloid cells , and other 
immunocytes in peritumoral inflammatory stroma has been shown to sustain the complex microenvironment needed for lymphoid and solid tumor maintenance (Soucek  
2011, Ponader 2012 , de Rooij 2012) .  Taken together, these findings suggest  inhibition 
of BTK may offer an attractive strategy for treating B -cell neoplasms, other hematologic 
malignancies, and solid tumors.   
In model systems, ex vivo analyses demonstrated BTK inhibition results in macrophages  
that polarize into M1 macrophages , instead of showing enhanced induction of 
immunosuppressive M2 macrophages (Ni Gabhann 2014 ).  These data suggest 
inhibition of BTK may impair the capacity of tumor -associated macrophages  critical for 
promotion of tumor invasion and metastasis ( Mouchemore 2013 ).  Several lines of 
evidence demonstrate BTK inhibition interferes with cross -talk between malignant cells 
and their microenvironment, suggesting disruption of intrinsic and extrinsic survival 
signals may be a critical mechanism for the clinical activity of BTK inhibitors (Ponader  
2012, Herman 2013 ).  Furthermore,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_876848] -associated macrophages (TAMs), which are the dominant innate immune cell in 
mammary cancers of humans (Pollard 2009 ).  Therefore,  the clinical usefulness of BTK 
inhibitors may extend to the treatment of invasive solid tumors.  
BTK is also a signaling hub in immature myeloid cells known as myeloid derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs ) (Schmidt 2004 ).  Recent evidence suggests MDSC play an 
important part in suppression of host immune responses through several mechanisms

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 32 of 163 such as production of arginase 1, release of r eactive oxygen species,  nitric oxide and 
secretion of immune- suppres sive cytokines.   This leads to an immunosuppressive 
environment necessary for  the growth of malignant cells ( Condamine 2014, Wesolowski 
2013) .   
Immune evasion is one of the multiple characteristics of cancer.   Monoclonal antibodies 
that block negative regulators of T cells, such as PD -1, amplify immune responses. 
Antibodies against PD- 1 are showing impressive results in advanced hematologic and 
solid malignancies ( Hamid 2013 , Westin 2014 , Berger 2 008, Topalian 2014) .  
Interestingly, studies examining c irculating MDSC s in anti -CTL4 and anti- PD-1/PD -L1-
treated patients have shown alterations in the myeloid cell compartment correlate with 
clinical outcome.  S pecifically, solid tumor progressors had proportionally higher 
circulating MDSC levels and a high myeloid gene signature (Powles  2014, Heery 2014 , 
Weide 2014 , Meyer 2014 ).  Recent preclinical results show elevated MDSC levels  are 
responsible for this lack of response and elimination of MDSCs may lead to increased efficacy with immune checkpoint blockade (Highfill 2014 , Kim 2014 ).  
Given the potential for BTK inhibition to affect TAMs and MDSCs, single- agent 
acalabrutinib was e valuated in mice with NSCLC arising as the result of G12D mutant 
Kras triggered by [CONTACT_876865] ( KrasLA2  mice).  This 
model  has several advantages over traditional transgenic strategies, including that it 
more closely recapi[INVESTIGATOR_876849]  
(Johnson 2001 ).  Mice were enrolled after identification of spontaneously appearing 
tumors in the lung by [CONTACT_84798]- CT scanning (~ 8 to 10 weeks of age) .  Mice were treated 
with vehicle (N=19 ) or acalabrutinib administered orally at a dosage  of 15  mg/kg/dose 
twice per day (BID) (N=18) for [ADDRESS_1225059] 
scanning, in 14 of 18 mice (78%) compared with 2 of 19 mice (11%) treated with vehicle.

As seen in the lung cancer model, analysis of tumor tissues showed that 
immunosuppressive TAMs (CD11b+Ly6ClowF4/80+Csf1r+), MDSCs (Gr1+Ly6CHi), and T reg 
(CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) were significantly reduced with acalabrutinib treatment by 47%,

Lastly, t he activity of acalabrutinib was confirmed in an orthotopic mouse model 
evaluating both single- agent and combination efficacy.  In this study, 10,000 KPC mouse 
pancreatic cancer cells were injected into the pancreases of 24 female mice.  After one 
week of expansion, drug treatment was started in mice developi[INVESTIGATOR_876851].   
Animals were treated with vehicle (N=6); acalabrutinib, 15  mg/kg/BID given orally (N=6);

or acalabrutinib, 15  mg/kg/BID given orally together with gemcitabine, 5 0 mg/kg IV

mice in the vehicle group showed signs of deteriorating health and all groups were 
euthanized.  Tumors were collected and measured (Figure 1-8); relative to the vehicle 
treatment, acalabrutinib monotherapy resulted in a 2 -fold reduction in tumor growth, 
results which compared favorably with gemcitabine alone.  The combination of 
acalabrutinib and gemcitabine resulted in a further reduction in tumor growth when 
compared to each single agent.

In summary, acalabrutinib alone and in combination with gemcitabine produces robust 
antitumor effects in established solid tumor models.  The antitumor effect observed with 
acalabrutinib correlates with biomarkers of response similar to those reported for other

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 38 of 163 1.4 A CASE FOR COMBINATI ON BTK AND CHECKPOINT BLOCKADE  
To determine whether  there is potential synergy between BTK inhibition and PD -1 
blockade, Acerta has conducted a nonclinical study of acalabrutinib in combin ation with 
an anti -PD-L1 antibody in an orthotopic colon cancer murine model.  Mice were 
inoculated with syngeneic CT26 colorectal cancer cells on Day 0; Anti -PD-L1 (150 μg on 
Day 6, 9, 12, 15) and acalabrutinib (15 mg/kg BID) treatment was begun on Day 6, when 
the tumor was well established.  Treatment with anti -PD-L1 as a single agent reduced 
tumor growth, but tumor regression was not observed (Figure 1 -9).  However, combined 
anti-PD-L1 and acalabrutinib treatment showed a further reduction in tumor growth (anti -
PD-L1, 820 mm3vs anti -PD-L1/acalabrutinib, 411 mm3).  Most strikingly, 6 of 9 ani mals 
displa yed tumor regression (Figure 1 -9).  These results suggest the combination therapy 
of BTK inhibition and PD -1 blockade  leads to greater benefit compared with PD-1 
blockade alone.

Abbreviation:  ACP -196 = acalabrutinib.  
In the tumor  microenvironment, we observed a significant reduction in the number of 
MDSCs within the tumor in mice treated with the anti -PD-L1/acalabrutinib combination 
when compared with a nti-PD-L1 treatment alone (Figure 1 -10).  The decrease of 
MDSC s is directly related to BTK inhibition .  This effect has been observed in 
monotherapy studies of acalabrutinib in murine pancreatic  and ovarian cancer model s 
(as described in Section 1.3).  Together, th ese data implicate tumor -associated MDSCs  
in preventing the full benefit of immune checkpoint blockade and offer  a translatable,  
therapeutic option by [CONTACT_876866] .

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 41 of 163 1.6 IN VIVO GENERAL TOXICOLOGY  – ACALABRUTINIB  
The systemic toxicity of acalabrutinib has been investigated in six repeat -dose general 
toxicology studies, three with recovery periods, in the rat and the dog.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_876852] [ADDRESS_1225069] level (NOAEL) in the dog was 30 mg/kg/day, which was 
the highest dose evaluated. In rats, 30 mg/kg/day resulted in minimal inflammation of the 
pancreas in some animals, with reversal, indicating the rat to be the more sensitive 
preclinical species.  The pancreatic effects were minimally increased at 100 mg/kg/day 
in the rat though there was no clinical evidence of toxicity.  Hence, 100 mg/kg/day was 
selected to conservatively represent the highest non- severely toxic dose (HNSTD) .  The 
pancreatic findings were investigated in subsequent rat toxicology studies and found to be treatment related, non- adverse at lower doses, and not associated with systemic 
toxicity or changes in biomarkers of pancreatic function.  The islet ce ll changes resemble 
a spontaneous pancreatic lesion that is described as an age- related finding in male rat s 
of this strain.  In dogs at 30 mg/kg/day, there were no microscopic findings in the 
pancreas, and all clinical biomarkers of pancreatic function were normal .  
In rats and dogs, no adverse ECG or histopathologic cardiovascular effects were noted at the planned conclusion of the 28 -day toxicology studies.  However, in 5 of 6  rats from 
the 300 -mg/kg dose group that died early in the study, slight to moderate necrosis of the 
myocardium and/or white blood cell infiltration/inflammation of the myocardium were noted on microscopic examination of the hearts.  These findings were most likely 
incidental postmortem changes .

For more detailed information on the clinical experience for acalabrutinib please refer to 
the Investigator Brochure.   
1.7.1  Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Acalabrutinib  
ACE-HV-001 was a PK/pharmacodynamic (PD), dose- ranging, food -effect, and drug-
drug interaction study evaluating BID and QD dosing for 1 or 2 days in healthy 
volunteers.  This study evaluated the PK/PD of acalabrutinib at various dose levels and 
regimens.  The starting dose for acalabrutinib was 2.5  mg BID.  This study has been 
completed and no adverse laboratory, vital signs, or ECG findings were observed (2.[ADDRESS_1225070]: Acalabrutinib (ACP -196) 
Date : 23 May 2016 
Protocol: ACE -ST-007 
 
 
 
Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 42 of 163 50 mg BID; 50 to 100 mg QD).  Three adverse events ( AEs) related to study drug were 
reported.  Each AE was Grade 1 and resolved without treatment.  The AEs were 
constipation (2.5 mg BID), feeling cold (75 mg QD), and somnolence (75 mg QD).  
In Part 1, PK properties of acalabrutinib were evaluated after oral administration of 
2 daily divided doses of 2.5 to 50 mg and a single dose of 100 mg.  Of the 30  subjects 
evaluated, all had observed systemic concentrations of acalabrutinib.  Acalabrutinib 
plasma time to maximum concentration (T max) values were between 0.[ADDRESS_1225071] dose 
administered.  When evaluating AUC 0-12, AUC 0-24 or AUC 0-inf, the mean values increased 
in a dose- proportional manner based on the increases of the total dose administered.  
Mean half -life (t 1/2) values ranged from 0.97 to 2.1 hours, and appeared to decrease as 
the dose increased.  The mean calculated oral clearance (CL/F: 165 to 219 L/h) and volume of distribution values (Vz/F: 233 to 612 L) appeared to be independent of the 
dose administered.  
Acalabrutinib was not detected in the urine of subjects receiving the 2.5 - or 5.0 -mg BID 
doses of acalabrutinib.  Acalabrutinib was detected in urine of other subjects (0.4% to 
0.6% of dose) and amounts increased in a dose -dependent manner.  
In Part 2, the effect of food on the PK of acalabrutinib (75 mg) after a single oral 
administration was evaluated in 6 men and 6 women.  Median time to maximum plasma 
acalabrutinib (T
max) values were increased in the fed state (2.5  hours) relative to the 
fasted state (0.5  hour).  The mean plasma acalabrutinib C max fed values decreased to 
27.3% of the C max values observed in the fasted state.  In contrast, the relative AUC 
exposure of acalabrutinib remained mostly unchanged in both states.  This decrease in 
exposure is not clinically significant; therefore, acalabrutinib can be taken without regard 
to meals . 
In Part 3, the effect of itraconazole on the PK of acalabrutinib (50 mg) after a single oral 
administration was evaluated in 17 subjects.  No difference in acalabrutinib T max values 
was observed in the presence or absence of itraconazole.  
Mean acalabruti nib exposures (as assessed by C max, AUC 0-last, AUC 0-24, and AUC 0-inf) 
increased in the presence of itraconazole.  The mean plasma acalabrutinib  Cmax values 
increased 3.7- fold in the presence of itraconazole.  The mean plasma AUC 0-last, AUC 0-24, 
and AUC 0-inf values also increased between 4.9- to 5.[ADDRESS_1225072]: Acalabrutinib (ACP -196)

(CL/F: 217 vs 44  L/h; Vz/F: 1190 vs 184 L).  No differences in half -life values were 
observed (3.3 vs 2.5 hours).  
The PD of acalabrutinib was evaluated using a BTK occupancy assay and correlated 
with a functional assay that determines the level of BTK inhibition by [CONTACT_657148]69 and CD86 on B cells.  A dose -dependent increase in BTK 
occupancy and corresponding decrease in CD69/86 expression was observed in this 
study.  Full BTK occupancy (≥ 90%) and complete CD86 and CD69 inhibition (≥ 90%) 
occurred at the 75 - and 100 -mg single dosed cohorts 1 to 3 hours after administration.  
Howeve r, only the 100 -mg cohort maintained high BTK occupancy (91.5%) and high 
BCR functional inhibition (CD86: 86 ± 3% and CD69: 78 ± 8%) at [ADDRESS_1225073] administration, full BTK 
targe t occupancy was observed 3 hours after the second dose for the 50 -mg dosed 
cohort ( BTK occupancy 97 ± 4%).

3.1.1  Safety Parameters  
The safety of acalabrutinib and pembrolizumab will be characterized by [CONTACT_89852], 
frequency, severity, timing of onset, duration, and relationship to study drug (s) of any 
treatment -emergent AEs  or abnormalities of laboratory tests; SAEs ; DLTs or AEs 
leading to discontinuation of study treatment.  
3.1.[ADDRESS_1225084] of acalabrutinib and 
pembrolizumab on B cells, T cells and MDSCs  will also be evaluated.  Tumor tissue , 
when available,  will be evaluated for PD -L1 expression.   Additional exploratory 
correlative studies  of tumor tissue , when available, may include characterization of tumor 
subtypes by [CONTACT_9064], gene expression or mutation analysis.    
The following PK parameters will be calculated, whenever possible, from plasma 
concentra tions of acalabrutinib: 
• AUC 0-last:  Area under the plasma concentration -time curve calculated using 
linear trapezoidal summation from time [ADDRESS_1225085], where “last” is the time of 
the last measurable concentration. 
• AUC 0-12:  Area under the plasma concen tration -time curve from 0 to 12 hours, 
calculated using linear trapezoidal summation.  
• AUC 0-inf:  Area under the plasma concentration- time curve from 0 to infinity, 
calculated using the formula: AUC 0-inf = AUC 0-last + C last / λz, where λ z is the 
apparent terminal elimination rate constant.  
• AUC 0-24calc:  Area under the plasma concentration- time curve from 0 to 24 hours, 
calculated by [CONTACT_378152] 0-12 
• C max:  Maximum observed plasma concentration  
• T max:  Time of the maximum plasma concentration (obtained without interpolation)  
• t ½:  Terminal elimination half -life (whenever possible)  
• λ z: Terminal elimination rate constant (whenever possible)  
• CL/F:  Oral clearance

3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN AND DOSING RE GIMEN  
As described in Section  1.7, acalabrutinib is curre ntly being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 
study in subjects with CLL (ACE-CL-001).  In this study, subjects have received oral 
dosages  of [ADDRESS_1225087] been well tolerated: 
• No MTD has been reached. 
• No DLT has occurred at any dose level.  
• No study -drug related AE has led to discontinuation from the study.   
• No study -drug related SAEs have occurred.

occupancy at 24 hours of all the regimens evaluated.   
The dose of pembrolizumab planned to be studied in this trial is 200  mg Q3W.  The dose 
recently approved in the [LOCATION_002] and several other countries for treatment of melanoma subjects is 2  mg/kg Q3W.  Information on the rationale for selecting 200 mg 
Q3W is summarized below.  
KEYNOTE- 001 was  an open- label Phase 1 study conducted to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, PK and PD, and anti- tumor activity of pembrolizumab when administered as 
monotherapy.  The dose escalati on portion of this trial evaluated 3 dose levels, 1  mg/kg, 
3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) and dose expansion cohorts evaluated 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All dose levels were well tolerated  and no DLTs were observed.  This first -in-human study 
of pembrolizumab showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels.  No MTD has been identified.  In addition, 
2 randomized cohort evaluations of melanoma subjects receiving pembrolizumab at a 
dose of 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W have been completed, and 1 randomized cohort 
evaluating 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W has also been completed.  The clinical 
efficacy and safety data demonstrate a lack of important differences in efficacy or safety profile across doses.  
An integrated body of evidence suggests that 200 mg Q3W is expected to provide similar response to 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q2W.  Previously, a flat pembrolizumab exposure- response relationship for efficacy and safety has been found 
in subjects with melanoma in the range of doses between 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg.  
Exposures for 200 mg Q3W are expected to lie within this range and will be close to those obtained with 2 mg/kg Q3W dos e.   
A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model, which characterized the influence of body weight and other patient covariates on exposure, has been developed.  The PK profile of pembrolizumab is consistent with that of other humanized monoclonal antibodies, which 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_44769] a low clearance and a limited volume of distribution.  The distribution of exposures from the 200 mg fixed dose are predicted to considerably overlap those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose and importantly will maintain individual patient

Protocol: ACE -ST-[ADDRESS_1225089] 200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose for pembrolizumab.  
As described in Section  1.4, Acerta Pharma has conducted a nonclinical study to 
evaluate the potential synergy of BTK inhibition with PD- 1 blockade and has seen 
encouraging results , which warrant testing the hypothesis in a clinical trial.

(note:  AEs clearly related to disease progression or the subject’s current medical history 
and associated comorbidities will not be considered DLTs): 
1. Grade 4 vomiting or diarrhea 
2. Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea lasting for > 72 hours

4. Dosing delay due to toxicity for > [ADDRESS_1225115] experiences a 
treatment -related DLT or other intolerable AE during the course of therapy, then 
acalabrutinib, pembrolizumab, or both drugs should be held, as necessary, until the AE 
resolves or stabilizes to an acceptable degree.  In cases where pembrolizumab is held, pembrolizumab should be restarted in agreement with its original dosing schedule (every 3 weeks).  As appropriate, certain laboratory abnormalities may warrant more frequent 
monitoring (eg, once per week) until abnormalities have recovered to Grade ≤ 1.  Dose 
reductions for acalabrutinib are provided in Table 3-2.  If acalabrutinib is reduced for 
apparent treatment -related toxicity, the dose need not be re- escalated, even if there is 
minimal or no toxicity with the reduced dose.  However, if the subject tolerates a reduced dose of acalabrutinib for ≥ 4 weeks then the dose may be inc reased to the next higher 
dose level, at the discretion of the investigator.  Such re -escalation may be particularly 
warranted if further evaluation reveals that the AE that led to the dose reduction was not treatment -related.  However, the maximum dose of  acalabrutinib is 100  mg BID for this 
protocol.

3.8.2  Supportive Care Guidelines for Pembrolizumab 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_12707].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriat e, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not 
improve with administration of corticosteroids.  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased.  For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such 
as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care.  The tre atment guidelines are intended to be applied when the 
investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note:  If after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below).  Refer to

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 61 of 163 • Pneumonitis:  
o For Grade  2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued 
over no less than 4 weeks.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti- inflammatory measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of 
prolonged steroid administration. 
• Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis 
(such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) 
and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink 
liberal quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, 
fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 
or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or 
rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis , administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis, treat with intravenous steroids 
followed by [CONTACT_78018].   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) 
or metabolic acidosis (DKA)  
o For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for Grade 3- 4 hyperglycemia associated with 
metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine 
ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
• Hypophysitis: 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids.  When symptoms improve 
to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no 
less than 4 weeks.  Replacement of appropriate hormones may b e 
required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids 
followed by [CONTACT_78019].  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or 
less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the

changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during 
treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs 
and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 3 -4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta- blocker s (eg, propranolol) 
are suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care. 
o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_79918].  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, 
steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required

Warfarin  or equivalent vitamin K antagonists (eg, phenprocoumon)  are prohibited.   
At study entry, s ubjects may be using topi[INVESTIGATOR_876855].  
During study participation, subjects may also receive systemic or enteric corticosteroids 
at any required dosage as needed  for treatment  emergent immune -mediated adverse 
reactions associated with pembrolizumab therapy (see Section  3.8.2 ), but use of 
corticosteroids (at dosages equivalent to prednisone >  20 mg/day for longer than 
2 weeks)  as therapy for cancer is not permitted.  
Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_1225130] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial are prohibited.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not 
limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine.  Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally 
killed virus vaccines and are allowed.  However, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg,  Flu - 
Mist® ) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.  
Use of calcium carbonate- containing drugs or supplements and short -acting H2- receptor 
antagonists should be avoided for at least 2 hours b efore or after acalabrutinib

3.10 PRECAUTIONS  
3.10.1  Transaminase Elevations for Acalabrutinib in Combination 
with Pembrolizumab  
Serum transaminase elevations (including elevations of AST and/or ALT) may be 
increased in severity and frequency in subjects exposed to the combination of acalabrutinib and pembrolizumab, as compared with subjec ts exposed to 
pembrolizumab monotherapy and subject s exposed to acalabrutinib monotherapy.  
Routine monitoring for serum transaminase elevations must follow the Schedule of Assessments (serum chemistry lab assessments).   Dosing delays and modifications for 
subjects with serum transaminase elevations must follow guidance provided in Section 3.8.

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 66 of 163 3.10.2  Hepatitis B Reactivation  
Serious or life- threatening reactivation of viral hepatitis may occur in subjects treated 
with acalabrutinib.  Therefore, subjects who are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) 
positive  (or have a known history of HBV)  should be monitored monthly with a 
quantitative PCR test for HBV DNA.  Monthly monitoring should continue until  [ADDRESS_1225131] dose of study drug(s).  Any subject with a rising viral load (above lo wer limit of 
detection) should discontinue study drug(s) and have antiviral therapy instituted and a 
consultation with a physician with expertise in managing hepatitis B.  Insufficient data 
exist regarding the safety of resuming acalabrutinib in subjects who develop HBV 
reactivation.   
3.10.[ADDRESS_1225132] excessive consumption of 
grapefruit, grapefruit juice, or Sev ille orange juice (which contain potent CYP3A 
inhibitors) or using herbal remedies or dietary  supplements (in particular, St  John’s wort, 
which is a potent CYP3A inducer).  
Otherwise subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required t o 
manage an AE such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. 
3.10.4  Drug -drug Interactions  
At the systemic exposure levels expected in this study, acalabrutinib inhibition of CYP 
metabolism is not anticipated.  However, concomitant administration of acalabrutinib with 
a strong CYP3A  incre ased exposure by [CONTACT_3450] 5 -fold.  Consequently, the 
concomi tant use of strong inhibitors/inducers of  CYP3A (see Appendix 2 ) should be 
avoided when possible.    
Based on these considerations, subjects who require therapy with drugs listed in 
Appendix [ADDRESS_1225133] of agents that reduce gastric acidity (eg, proton -pump inhibitors, H2- receptor 
antagonists or antacids) on acalabrutinib absorption was evaluated in a healthy

avoid the use of calcium carbonate containing drugs or supplements (eg, antacids and 
calcium supplements ) and short -acting H2-receptor antagonists for a period of at least 
2 hours before and after taking acalabrutinib.   Use of omeprazole, esomeprazole, 
lansoprazole or any other proton -pump inhibitors (eg, rabeprazole, or pantoprazole) 
while taking acalabrutinib is not recommended  due to a potential decrease in study drug

Response  
Category  Definition 
CR Disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions including normalization of an elevated 
tumor marker level. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must 
have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
PR A ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions taking as a reference the 
baseline sum of the diameters.   
SD Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD  taking 
as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
PDa At least  a 20% increase in the sum  of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:   the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).    
Abbreviations: CR=complete response, PD=progressive disease, PR=partial response, SD=stable disease  
a. Transient apparent worsening of disease early in therapy or during temporary interruption of study therapy (eg, 
for drug -related toxicity or intercurrent illness) may not indicate true cancer progression.  Refer to Section 3.11 
for more detailed information.  
 
Evaluation of nontarget lesions:  while some nontarget lesions may actually be 
measurable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments.

a. If a CR is truly met at first timepoint, then any disease seen at a subsequent timepoint, even disease 
meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR).   Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met.  
However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the subject had PR, not CR at the first timepoint.  Under these circumstances, 
the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 83 of 163 Section 6.2.6 ) and to document the occurrence of any new events , regardless of 
whether the subject receives a new anticancer therapy or demonstrates disease 
progression within this timeframe .  Subjects who withdraw consent for study treatment 
should still be encouraged to complete the safety follow -up assessments, but these 
assessments cannot be mandated if subject consent for further study participation is 
withdrawn.  The Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 4 ) describes the procedures 
requir ed for  safety follow -up.

4.5 MISSED EVALUATIONS  
Missed evaluations should be rescheduled and performed as close to the original scheduled date as possible.  An exception is made when rescheduling becomes, in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], medically unnecessary or unsafe because it is too close in time to 
the next scheduled evaluation.  In that case , the missed evaluation should be 
abandoned.  
5.0 STATISTICAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS  
5.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
Descriptive statistics (including means, standard deviations, and medians for continuous 
variables and proportions and confidence intervals [CIs] for discrete variables) will be 
used to summarize data as appropriate.

5.2 DEFINITION OF ANALYS IS POPULATIONS  
The following definitions will be used for the efficacy and safety analysis populations . 
All-treated population:  All enrolled subjects  who receive ≥  1 dose of any study drug  
(either acalabrutinib or pembrolizumab) .  The safety and primary efficacy analyses will 
be performed on the All- treated population.  
Efficacy -evaluable population :  All subjects in the All- treated population who have 
≥ [ADDRESS_1225177] dose of study drug (either 
acalabrutinib or pembrolizumab).  Sensitivity analyses for efficacy will be carried out on 
the Efficacy -evaluable population.  
5.[ADDRESS_1225178] to follow -up (or drop out) will 
be included in statistical analyses to the point of their last evaluation.  
5.4 ENDPOINT DATA ANALYS IS 
5.4.1  Safety Endpoint  
Safety summaries will include summaries in the form of tables and listings.  The 
frequency (number and percentage) of treatment emergent AEs and events of clinical 
interest  will be reported in each t reatment group by [CONTACT_12513] (MedDRA) System Organ Class and Preferred Term.  Summaries will also be 
presented by [CONTACT_378151] (per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events [CTCAE ], v4.03 or higher ) and by [CONTACT_8792] (eg, either 
acalabrutinib, pembrolizumab, or both) . 
Laboratory shift tables containing counts and percentages will be prepared by [CONTACT_15500], laboratory parameter, and time.  Summary tables will be prepared for each laboratory parameter.  Figures of changes in laboratory parameters over ti me will be 
generated.  
Results of vital sign assessments and physical exams will be tabulated and summarized.

terms of the proportion of study drug actually taken. 
5.4.4  Analysis of Efficacy Parameters  
Disease Control and Response Rate  
The individual and composite endpoints of response and progression will be determined. Tumor control will be documented at each assessment by [CONTACT_115188] (see Section 4.2) as defined for each response parameter, date that response is first 
documented, and date of disease progression.   DCR will be defined as the proportion of 
subjects who achieve a SD, PR or CR.  ORR will be defined as the proportion of  
subjects who achieve a CR or PR (see Section 4.2).  
DCR and ORR will be calculated and the corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI will be derived.  
In addition to evaluation of DCR and ORR by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria ( Eisenhauer 2009), 
these endpoints  will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_498256]  (Appendix 8
), though the 
ORR by [CONTACT_657159].  
Duration of Response 
The duration of  response  (DOR)  is defined as the interval from the first documentation of 
response to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or 
death from any cause .  Kaplan- Meier methods  will be used to estimate event -free curves 
and corresponding qua rtiles (including the median).   Data from surviving, 
non-progressing subjects will be censored and detailed censoring rules will be specified 
in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) .

curves and corresponding quar tiles (including the median).  Data from surviving, non-
progressing subjects will be censored and detailed censoring rules will be specified in 
the SAP.  
Overall Survival  
OS is defined as the  time from date of the first dose of study drug  until date of death due 
to any cause.  Subjects who are known to be alive or whose survival status is unknown 
will be censored at the date last known to be alive.  The analysis methods for overall 
survival will be similar to those described for progression- free survival .  
5.4.[ADDRESS_1225181] characteristics and outcome measures and correlations 
among outcomes measures will be explored using regression models or other appropriate techniques.  
5.5 FUTILITY AND TOXICITY MONITORING 
The futility and toxicity monitoring will be analyzed in the  combination arm (Arm 2) only  
as data become available. Futility will be monitored by [CONTACT_657160], which is defined as irCR, 
irPR, an d irSD by [CONTACT_90589]  (Appendix 8 ).  irDCR of at least 20% is clinically meaningful 
in this population.  The response outcome within the 12 weeks will  be used in the futility 
analyses .  A Bayesian method ( Thall 1995 ) will be used for futility and toxicity monitoring 
for the combination arm . The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_567259]:  
• Pr(θE< 0.20 |data)>0.95

• Pr(T E > 0.3 0 | data) > 0.90  
Enrollment in the combination arm will be stopped early if there is > 95% probabili ty that 
the irDCR is < 20% or there is > 90% probability that the toxicity rate is higher than 30% 
in that arm.  Where θE denotes the marginal response rate, assuming that θE follows a

6.1 D EFINITIONS  
6.1.1  Adverse Events 
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational (medicinal) product, regardless of 
attribution. 
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the pro tocol -
specified AE reporting period, including si gns or symptoms associated with 
lung cancer  that were not present before the AE reporting period (see 
Section 6.2.1 ). 
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) 
judged by [CONTACT_108975]- spec ified AE reporting period.  
Abnormal laboratory values considered  clinically  significant by [CONTACT_876871]. 
6.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
The terms “ severe ” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity (or intensity) refers to 
the grade o f an AE (see below).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on 
subject or event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide

Date : 23 May 2016 
Protocol: ACE -ST-007 
 
 
 
Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 89 of 163 for defining regulatory reporting obligations from the sponsor to applicable regulatory 
authorities.  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if it meets any 1 of the following criteria:  
• It results in death (ie, the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is li fe-threatening (ie, the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the 
subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).  
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (ie, the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions).  
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother ex posed to the investigational product.  
• It is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] (eg, may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical/surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above).  
6.1.3  Severity  
Definitions found in the CTCAE version 4.03 or higher  will be used for grading the 
severity (intensity) of AEs. The CTCAE displays Grades [ADDRESS_1225185] experience any AE 
not listed in the CTCAE, the following g rading system should be used to assess severity:  
• Grade 1 (Mild AE) – experiences which are usually transient, requiring no 
special treatment, and not interfering with the subject’s daily activities  
• Grade 2 ( Moderate AE) – experiences which introduce some level of 
inconvenience or concern to the subject, and which may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212] 
• Grade 3 (Severe AE) – experiences which are unacceptable or intolerable, 
significantly interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity, and require systemic drug therapy or other treatment  
• Grade 4 (Life- threatening or disabling AE) – experiences which cause the 
subject to be in imminent danger of death  
• Grade 5 (Death related to AE) – experiences which result in subject death

due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study,  must be reported 
through [ADDRESS_1225189] initiates a new anticancer therapy within the 90 day posttreatment timeframe.     
SAEs considered related to study drug(s) occurring after the end of the AE reporting 
period (as defined above) must be reported.   
If an SAE  is present at the last study visit, the SAE should be followed to resolution or 
until the investigator assesses the subject as stable, or the subject is lost to follow -up or 
withdraws consent.  Resolution/stable means the subject has returned to baseline state 
of health or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event .

Disease progression itself is not considered an AE; however, signs and symptoms of 
disease progression may be recorded as AEs or SAEs.  
Each recorded AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_657163], duration (e g, start and 
end dates), severity, regulatory seriousness criteria, if applicable, suspected relationship to the study drug s (see following guidance), and any actions taken.  The causality of AEs 
to the study drug s will be assessed by [CONTACT_7859]:  ‘Is there a reasonable

(whichever is earlier ) will be reported, followed to conclusion, and the outcome reported, 
as long as the subject or partner is willing to participate in follow -up. 
A pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_367386] a contraceptive medication.  Likewise, elective abortions without complications are not consider ed AEs.  Any SAEs associated with pregnancy (eg, congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects/spontaneous miscarriage or any other serious events) must additionally be reported as such using the SAE report form.  
Subject s should be instructed to immediately notify the investigator of any pregnancies.  
Any f emale subjects receiving study drug  who become pregnant must immediately 
discontinue study drug.  The investigator should counsel the subject, discussing any 
risks of continuing the pregnancy and any possible effects on the fetus.

Whenever possible, AEs/ SAEs should be reported by [CONTACT_528757] a 
constellation of symptoms.   
Death due to disease progression should be recorded on the appropriate form in the 
electronic data capture system.  If the  primary cause of death is disease progression, the 
death due to disease progression should not be reported as an SAE. If the primary cause of death is something other than disease progression, then the death should be reported as an SAE with the primary cause of death as the event  term, as death is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_36069], not the event itself.  The primary cause of death on 
the autopsy report should be the term reported.  Autopsy and postmortem repor ts must 
be forwarded to Acerta Pharma  Drug Safety, or designee, as outlined above.  
If study drug is discontinued because of an SAE, this information must be included in the SAE report.  
An SAE may qualify for mandatory expedited reporting to regulatory authorities if the SAE is attributable to the investigational product (or if a causality assessment is not 
provided for the SAE, in which case a default of ‘related’ may  be used for expedited 
reporting purposes) and the SAE is not listed in the current Investigator Brochure (ie, an 
unexpected event).  In this case, Acerta Pharma  Drug Safety/Designee will forward a 
formal notification des cribing the suspected unexpected adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  to all 
investigators.   Each investigator must then notify his or he r IRB/IEC of the S[LOCATION_003]R.

5 WARNINGS A ND PRECAUT IONS
5.1 Immune -Mediated Pneumonitis
Immune -mediated pneumonitis , including fatal cases, occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor 
patients for signs and s ymptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluat e patients with suspected pneumonitis with 
radiogra phic imaging and administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or 
equivalent followed by a taper) for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate 
(Grade 2) pneu monitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3),life-threatening 
(Grade 4),or recurrent moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and 
Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Melanoma
Pneumonitis occurred in 32(2.0%)of 1567 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trials 1, 2, and 6, including 
Grade 1 (0.8%), Grade 2 (0.8%), and Grade 3 (0.4%) pneumonitis . The median time to development of 
pneum onitis was 4.3 months (range : 2daysto 19.3 months). The median duration was 2.6months
(range : 2daysto 15.1 months). Twelve (38%) of the 32 patients received corticosteroids, with 9 of the 12 
receiving high-dose systemic corticosteroids for a median duration of 8 days (range: 1 day to 1.1 months)
followed by a corticosteroid taper. Pneumon itis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 9 ( 0.6%)patients. 
Pneumonitis completely resolved in 21 (66%) of the 32patients . 
NSCLC
Pneumonitis occurred in 19 (3.5%) of 550 patients with NSCLC, including Grade 2 (1.1%), Grade 3 
(1.3%), Grade 4 (0.4 %), orGrade 5 (0.2%) pneumonitis in patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The 
median tim e to development of pneumonitis was 1.7 months (range : 4daysto 12.9 months). In patients 
receiving KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 14days, the median time to development of pne umonitis was 
shorter (1.5 months) compared with patients receiving 10 mg/kg every 21 day s(3.5months). Sixteen of 
the 19 patients (84%) received corticosteroids, with 14 of the 19 (74%) requiring high -dose systemic 
corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day ). The median starting 
dose of high -dose corticosteroid treatment for these fourteen patients was 60 mg/day with a median 
duration of treatment of 8 days (range : 1day to 4.2 months). The median duration of pneumonit is was 
1.2months (range : 5daysto 12.4 months). Pneumonitis occurred more frequently in patients with a 
history of asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.4%) than in patients without a history of these 
diseases (3.1%). Pneumonitis occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic 
radiation (6.0%) than in patients who did not receive prior thoracic radiation (2.6%). Pneumonitis led to 
discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 12 (2.2%) patients. Pneumonitis completely resolved in [ADDRESS_1225243] dose of KEYTRUDA .
5.2 Immune -Mediated Colitis
Immune -mediated colitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and 
symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent 
followed by a taper) for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) or severe 
(Grade 3) colitis, and permanen tly discontinue KEYTRUDA for life -threatening (Grade 4) colitis [see 
Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .
Melanoma
Colitis occurred in 31(2.0%) of 1567 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trials 1, 2, and 6, including 
Grade 2 (0.5%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 4 (0.1%) colitis . The median t ime to onset of colitis was 
3.4months (range :10daysto 9.7 months). The median duration of colitis was 1.4months (range : 1day
to 7.2 months) . Twenty-one (68%) of the 31 patients received corticos teroids , all of whom required high -
dose systemic corticosteroids for a median duration of 6days (range : 1dayto 5.3months) followed by a 
5corticosteroid taper. Colitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 14 (0.9%) patients. Colitis resolved in 
27(87%) of the 31 patients. 
NSCLC
Colitis occurred in 4 (0.7%) of 550 patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%) or Grade 3 (0.4%) colitis in patients 
receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to onset of colitis was 1.6 months (range :28 day sto 
2.2months) and t he median duration was 16 days (range : 7daysto 1.3 months). Two patients were 
started on high -dose corticosteroids ( greater than or equal to 40mg prednisone or equivalent per day ) 
and two patients were started on low dose corticosteroids. One patient (0 .2%) discontinued KEYTRUDA 
due to colitis. Three patients with colitis experienced complete resolution of the event.
5.3 Immune -Mediated Hepatitis
Immune -mediated hepatitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in 
liver fun ction. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day [for Grade 2 hepatitis ]and 1 to 
2mg/kg/day [for Grade 3 or greater hepatitis ]prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) and, based 
on severity of liver enzy me elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Melanoma
Hepatitis occurred in 16(1.0%)of 1567 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trials 1, 2, and 6, including 
Grade 2 (0.1%) , Grade 3 (0.7%), and Grade 4 (0.1%) hep atitis. The time to onset was 26days (range : 
8days to 21.4 months). The median du ration was 1.2 months (range: 8 days to 4.7 months). Eleven 
(69%) of the 16 patie nts received corticosteroids, with 10 of the 11 receiving high-dose systemic 
corticosteroids for a median duration of 5 days (range: 1 to 14 days) followed by a corticosteroid taper. 
Hepatitis led to disconti nuation of KEYTRUDA in 6 (0.4%) patients. Hepatitis resolved in 14 (88%) of the 
16patients .
5.4 Immune -Mediated Endocrinopathies
Hypophysi tis
Hypophy sitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and sy mptoms of hy pophy sitis 
(including hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_44791]). Administer corticosteroids and hormone 
replacement as clinically indicated. W ithhold KEYTRUDA fo r moderate (Grade 2) hypophysitis and 
withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life -threatening (Grade 4) hypophysitis [see
Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Melanoma
Hypophy sitis occurred in 13(0.8%)of 1567 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trials 1, 2, and 6 including 
Grade 2 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 4 (0.1%) hypophy sitis. The time to onset was 3.3months 
(range: 1 day to 7.2 months) . The median duration was 2.7months (range: 12 days to 12.7 months). 
Twelve (92%) of the 13 patients received corticosteroids , with 4 of the 12 patients receiving high -dose
systemic corticosteroids. Hypophy sitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 4 (0.3%) patients. 
Hypophy sitis resolved in 7 (54%) of the 13 patients.
NSCLC
In Trial 1, hy pophy sitis occurred in 1 (0.2%) of 550 patients, which was Grade 3 in severity. The time to 
onset was 3.7 months. The patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids and physiologic hormone 
replacement therapy. The patient did not disco ntinue KEYTRUDA due to hypophysitis.
Thyroid Disorders
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function 
(at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and 
for clinical signs and sy mptoms of thy roid disorders.
6Administer replacement hormones for hypothy roidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and 
beta- blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life -threatening 
(Grade 4) hyperthyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and A dverse Reactions (6.1)].
Melanoma
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 51(3.3%) of 1567 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trials 1, 2, or 6, 
including Grade 2 (0.6%) and Grade 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism . The median time to onset was 1.4months 
(range : 1day to 21.9 months). The median duration was 1.7 months (range : 1day to 12.8 months). 
Hyperthyroidism led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 2(0.1%) patients .Hyperthyroidism resolv ed in 
36(71%) of the 51 patients.
Hypothy roidism occurred in 127(8.1%) of 1567 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trials1, 2, and 6 
including Grade 3 (0.1%) hypothy roidism. The median time to onset of hypothyroidism was 3.3months 
(range : 5daysto 18.9 months). The median du ration was 5.4 months (range: 6 days to 24.3 months). No 
patient sdiscontinued KEYTRUDA due to hypothy roidism. Hypothyroidism resolved in 24 (19%) of the 
127patients.
NSCLC
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 10 (1.8%) of 550 patients receiv ing KEYTRUDA in Trial 1, including Grade 2 
(0.7%) or Grade 3 (0.3%) hyperthyroidism. The median time to onset was 1.8 months (range : 2days to 
3.4months), and the median duration was 4.5 months (range : 4weeks to 7.5 months). No patients 
discontinued KEYT RUDA due to hyperthyroidism. 
Hypothy roidism occurred in 38 (6.9%) of 550 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1, including Grade 2 
(5.5%) or Grade 3 (0.2%) hypothy roidism . The median time to onset was 4.2 months (range :20daysto 
11.2 months), and the median duration was 5.8 months (range :11 day sto 22.8 months). No patients 
discontinued KEYTRUDA due to hypothyroidism.
Type 1 Diabetes mellitus
Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 3 (0.1%) of 2117 patients with 
melanom aor NSCLC receiving KEYTRUDA in Trials 1, 2, and 6 . Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or 
other signs and sy mptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA 
and administer anti -hyperglycemics in patients with severe hypergl ycem ia [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
5.5 Immune -Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction
Immune -mediated nephritis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in 
renal function. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent 
followed by a taper) for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. W ithhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2), and 
permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life -threatening (Grade 4) nephritis [see 
Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Melanoma
Nephritis occurred in 7 (0.4%) of 1567 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trials 1, 2, and 6, including 
Grade 2 (0.2%) , Grade 3 (0.2%), and Grade 4 (0.1%) nephritis. The median time to onset of nephritis was 
5.1months (range: 12 days to 12.8 months). The median duration was 1.1 months (range: 3 days to 
3.3months). Six (86%) of the 7 patients received corticosteroids , with 5 of the 6 receiving high-dose 
systemic corticoste roids for a median duration of 15 days (range: 3 days to 1.6 months) followed by a 
corticosteroid taper. Nephritis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 2 (0.1%) patients. Nephritis 
resolved in 4 (57%) of the [ADDRESS_1225244] 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose 
immune -related adverse reactions coul d not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other 
systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the immune -mediated 
adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper . Permanently discontinue
KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune -mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life -threatening 
immune -mediated adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Melanoma
The following clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless 
otherwise indicated) of 1567 patients with melanoma treated with KEYTRUDA in Trials 1, 2, and 6 : 
arthritis (1.6%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, uveitis, m yositis, Guillain -Barré syn drome, 
myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with 
inflammatory  foci in brain parenchy ma.
NSCLC
The following clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions occurred in less tha n 1% of 
550patients with NSCLC treated with KEYTRUDA in Trial 1:rash, vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, serum 
sickness ,and m yasthenia gravis.
5.[ADDRESS_1225245] been reported in 3 (0.1%) of 2117 patients
receiving KEYTRUDA in Trials 1, 2, and 6 .Monitor patients for signs and sy mptoms of infusion -related 
reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, prurit us, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. 
For severe (Grade 3) or li fe-threatening (Grade 4) infusion -related reactions, stop infusion and 
permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3)].
5.8 Embryofetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA cancause fetal harm when adm inistered to a pregnant 
woman. Anim al models link the PD -1/PD -L1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through 
induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the 
patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. 
Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during tr eatment with 
KEYTRUDA and for [ADDRESS_1225246] dose of KEYTRUDA [see Use i n Specific Populations (8. 1, 
8.3)].
6 ADVERSE REA CTIONS
The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling. 
Immune -mediated pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Immune -mediated colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .
Immune -mediated hepatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .
Immune -mediated endocrinopathies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] .
Immune -mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] .
Other immune -mediated adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 6)].
Infusion -related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] .
6.[ADDRESS_1225247] udies, KEYTRUDA was administered at 
doses of2mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks (19%), 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks (31%), or 
10mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks (50%). Among these 2117, 43% of the patients were exposed for 
6months or more and 1 0% of the patients were exposed for 12 months or more.
The data described below were obtained in two randomized, open -label, active -controlled clinical trials 
(Trials 2 and 6), which enrolled 912 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma or in a s ingle -arm 
trial (Trial 1), which enrolled 550 patients with metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In these 
trials, KEYTRUDA was administered at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks. 
Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b-Naive Melanoma (Trial 6)
The safety  of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who 
had not received prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_657123] 6. Trial 6was a m ulticenter, open -label, active -controlled trial where patients were 
randomized (1:1:1) and received KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=278) or KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg 
every 3weeks (n=277) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg every 
3weeks for 4 doses unless discontinued earlier for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (n=256) 
[see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required 
systemic corticosteroids or other immu nosuppressive medication; a history of interstitial lung disease; or 
active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C ,were ineligible. 
The median duration of exposure was 5.6months (range : 1day to 11.0 months) for KEYTRUDA and 
similar in both treatment arms. Fifty-one and 46% of patients received KEYTRUDA 10mg/kg every 2 or 
3weeks, respectively, for ≥6months. No patients in either arm received treatment for more than one 
year.
The study population characteristics were: median a ge of 62 years (range: 18 to 89 years), 60% male, 
98% White, 32% had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value at baseline, 65% had M1c stage 
disease, 9% with history of brain metastasis, and approximately 36% had been previously treated with 
one or mo re lines of systemic therapy which included a BRAF inhibitor (15%), chemotherapy (13%), and 
immunotherapy (6%). 
In Trial 6, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the every 2 week and ever y 3week schedule, 
therefore summary safety results are prov ided in a pooled analysis (n=555) of both KEYTRUDA arms. 
Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA occurred in 9% of patients. 
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), 
autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). 
Adverse reactions l eading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 21% of patients; the most common 
(≥1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) 
were fatigue and diarrhea. Table [ADDRESS_1225248] 10% of patients receiving

The safety  of KEYTRUDA inpatients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease progression 
following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor, was evaluated in Trial 2. 
Trial 2 was a multicenter, partially blinded ( KEYTRUDA dose), randomized (1:1:1), active -controlled trial 
in which 528 patients received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg (n=178) or 10 mg/kg (n=179) ever y 3weeks or 
investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (n=171), consisting of dacarbazine (26%), temozolomide (25%), 
paclitaxel and carboplatin (25%), paclitaxel (16%), or carboplatin (8%) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The 
trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, severe immune- related toxicity related to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
defined as any Grade 4 toxicity or Grade 3 toxici ty requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 
10mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for greater than 12 weeks; medical conditions that required 
systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of interstitial lung disease; or 
an active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C.
Themedian dur ation of exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.7 months (range: 1 day to 
16.6 months) and to KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 4.8 months (range: 1 day to 16.8 months). 
The data described below reflect exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg in 36% of patients exposed to 
KEYTRUDA for ≥6months and in 4 % of patients exposed for ≥12months. In the KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg 
arm, 41% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for ≥6 months and 6% of patients were exposed to 
KEYTRUDA for ≥12months.
The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 15 to 89 years), 61% male, 
98% W hite, 41% with an elevated LDH value at baseline, 83% with M1c stage disease, 73% received two 
or more prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_657125] (100% received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164] 25% a BRAF 
inhibitor ), and 15% with history of brain metastasis. 
In Trial 2, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the 2 mg/kg dose and 10 mg/kg dose, therefore 
summary  safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=357) of both KEYTRUDA arms. Adverse 
reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation occurred in 12% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA; the 
most common ( ≥1%) were general phy sical health deterioration (1%), asthenia (1%), dyspnea (1%), 
pneum onitis (1%), and generalized edema (1%). Adverse reactions leadi ng to interruption of KEYTRUDA 
occurred in 14% of patients; the most common ( ≥1%) were dy spnea (1%), diarrhea (1%), and maculo -

Among the 550patients with metastatic NSCLC enrolled in Trial 1, the median duration of therapy was 
2.8months (range: 1day to 25.6 months). Patients with NSCLC and autoimmune disease ,a medical 
condition that required immunosuppression ,or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation 
within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible for Trial 1. The median age of pati ents was 64 years (range: 28 
to 93) , 47% were age 65years o r older, 53% were male , 83% were White, and 67% received two or more 
prior systemic treatments. D isease characteristics were Stage III (4%), Stage IV (9 6%), and brain 
metastases ( 11%). Baseline EC OG performance status (PS) was 0 ( 35%) or 1 ( 65%).
KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 14% of patients. Serious adverse reactions 
occurred in 38% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported 
in at least 2% of patients were pleural effusion, pneumonia, dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, and 
pneum onitis. The incidence of adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, was similar 
between the two 10 mg/kg dosing schedules; therefore, these data were pooled. The majority of patients 
treated with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every three weeks had shorter follow -up compared with patients treated 
with the 10 mg/kg schedules; therefore, comparisons of adverse reactions between doses were not 
appropriate.

146.2 Immunogenicity
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. Trough levels of pembrolizumab 
interfere with the electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay results ; therefore , a subset analysis was 
performed in the patients with a concentration of pembrolizumab below the drug tolerance level of the 
anti-product antibody assay. In clinical studies in patients treated with pembrolizumab at a dose of
2mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every two or three weeks, 1 (0.3%) of 392 evaluable patients tested 
positive for treatment -emergent anti -pembrolizumab antibodies and confirmed positive in the neutralizing 
assay . 
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. 
Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay 
may be influenced by [CONTACT_17812], sample handling, t iming of sample 
collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence 
of antibodies to KEYTRUDA with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPU LATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy
Risk Summary
Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA cancause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. In animal models, the PD- 1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is important in the maintenance of 
pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue [see Data] . Human IgG4 
(immunoglobulins) are known to cross the placenta; therefore, pembrolizumab has the potential to be 
transmitted from the mother to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. There are no available human data informing the risk
of embryo -fetal toxicity . Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.
In the U.S. general population , the estimated background risk of maj or birth defects and miscarriage in 
clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15 -20%, respectively.
Data
Animal Data
Anim al reproduction studies have not been conducted with KEYTRUDA to evaluate its effect on 
reproduction and fetal development, but an assessment of the effects on reproduction was provided. A 
central function of the PD- 1/PD -L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by [CONTACT_657172]. Blockade of PD- L1 signaling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy t o 
disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss; therefore, potential risks of 
administering KEYTRUDA during pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported 
in the literature, there were no malformations related to the blockade of PD- 1 signaling in the offspring of 
these animals; however, immune -mediated disorders occurred in PD -[ADDRESS_1225254] women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and 
for 4 months after the final dose .

impairm ent[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
8.7 Hepatic Impairment
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, n o dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild 
hepatic impairment [total bilirubin (TB) less than or equal to ULN and AST greater than ULN or TB great er 
than [ADDRESS_1225256]]. KEYTRUDA has not been studied in patients with moderate (TB 
greater than 1.[ADDRESS_1225257]) or severe (TB greater than [ADDRESS_1225258])

11 DESCRIPTION
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD -1 and its 
ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. Pembrolizumab is an IgG4 kappa immunoglobulin with an approximate 
molecular weight of 149 kDa.
KEYTRUDA for injection is a sterile, preservative -free, white to off -white lyophilized powder in single -use 
vials. Each vial is reconstituted and diluted for intravenous infusion. Each 2 mL of reconstituted solut ion 
contains 50 mg of pembrolizumab and is formulated in L -histidine (3.1 mg), poly sorbate 80 (0.4 mg), and 
sucrose (140 mg). May contain hydrochloric acid/sodium hy droxide to adjust pH to 5.5. 
KEYTRUDA injection is a sterile, preservative- free, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow 
solution that requires dilution for intravenous infusion. Each vial contains 100mg of pembrolizumab in 
4mL of solution. Each 1 mL of solution contains 25 mg of pembrolizumab and is formulated in: L -histidine 
(1.55 mg), poly sorbate 80 (0.2 mg), sucrose (70 mg), and W ater for Injection, USP.
[ADDRESS_1225259] -mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the 
anti-tumor immune response. In s yngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD -1 activity resulted in 
decreased tumor growth.
12.3 Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab was studied in 2195 patients who received doses of 1 to 
10mg/kg ever y 2weeks or 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses 
16in patients with solid tumors, the geometric mean [% coefficient of variation (CV%)] for clearance, steady -
state volume of distribution, and terminal half -life were 202mL/day ( 37%), 7.38 L (19%) and 27 day s 
(38%), respectively.
Steady -state concentrations of pembrolizumab were reached by 19weeks o f repeated dosing with an 
every 3-week regimen and the systemic accumulation was 2.2-fold. The peak concentration (C max), trough 
concentration (C min), and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at steady state (AUC ss) 
of pembrolizumab increa sed dose proportionally in the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks.
Specific Populations : The effects of various covariates on the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab were 
assessed in population pharmacokinetic analyses. The CL of pembrolizumab increa sed with increasing 
body  weight; the resulting exposure differences were adequately addressed by [CONTACT_43602] a 
weight- based dose. The following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of pembrolizumab: 
age (range :15 to 94 years), ge nder, race, renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment, ortumor burden. 
Renal Impairment : The effect of renal impairment on the CL of pembrolizumab was evaluated by 
[CONTACT_657173] (eGFR 60 to 
89mL/min/1.73 m2; n=937), moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=201), or severe (eGFR 15 to 
29mL/min/1.73 m2; n=4) renal impairment compared to patients with normal (eGFR greater than or equal 
to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=1027 ) renal function. No cl inically important differences in the CL of 
pembrolizumab were found between patients with renal impairment and patients with normal renal 
function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Hepatic Impairment : The effect of hepatic impairment on the CL of pembrolizumab was evaluated by 
[CONTACT_657174] 
(TB less than or equal to ULN and AST greater than ULN or TB between [ADDRESS_1225260]; n= 269) compared to pa tients with normal hepatic function (TB and AST less than or equal to ULN; 
n=1871 ). No clinically important differences in the CL of pembrolizumab were found between patients with 
mild hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function. There is insufficient i nformation to determine 
whether there are clinically important differences in the CL of pembrolizumab in patients with moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].
[ADDRESS_1225261] not been con ducted with pembrolizumab. In 1 -month and 6 -month repeat- dose 
toxicology studies in mon keys, there were no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs; 
however, most animals in these studies were not sexually mature.
13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology
In animal models, inhibition of PD -[ADDRESS_1225262] also shown 
decreased survival following infection with ly mphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Administration of 
pembrolizumab in chimpanzees with naturally occurring chronic hepatitis B infection res ulted in two out of 
four animals with significantly increased levels of serum ALT, AST, and GGT, which persisted for at least 
1month after discontinuation of pembrolizumab.
1714 CLINICA L STUDIES
14.1 Melanoma
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -Naive Melanoma (Trial 6)
The safety  and efficacy  of KEYTRUDA were evaluated in Trial 6, a randomized (1:1:1), open -label, 
multicenter, active -controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA at a dose of 
10mg/kg ever y 2weeks or 10mg/kg ever y 3weeks as an intravenous infusion until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity or to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion for 4 doses 
unless discontinued earlier for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease 
progression could receive additional doses of treatment unless disease progression was sy mptomatic, 
was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_10480], required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or 
was confirmed at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging. Randomization was stratifi ed by [CONTACT_27939] (0 vs. 
1), ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), and PD -L1 expression ( ≥1% of tumor cells [positive] vs. < 1% of tumor cells 
[negative ]) according to an investigational use only (IUO) assay. Key eligibility criteria were unresectable 
or metastatic melano ma with progression of disease; no prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]; and no more than one prior 
systemic treatment for metastatic melanoma. Patients with BRAF V600E mutation -positive melanoma 
were not required to have received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy. Patients with a utoimmune disease; a 
medical condition that required immunosuppression; previous severe hypersensitivity to other monoclonal 
antibodies; and HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, were ineligible. Assessment of tumor status was 
performed at 12 weeks, t hen every 6 weeks through W eek48, followed by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 12 weeks thereafter. 
The major efficacy  outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and progression -free survival (PFS; as 
assessed by [CONTACT_19375] (BICR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors [RECIST v1.1]). Additional efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and 
response duration.
A total of 834 patients were randomized: 277 patients to the KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks arm, 
279 to the KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks arm, and 278 to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772]. The study 
population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 18 to 89 years), 60% male, 98% W hite, 
66% had no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease , 69% ECOG PS of 0, 80% had PD -L1 positive 
melanom a, 18% had PD -L1 negative melanoma, and 2% had unknown PD -L1 status using the IUO 
assay, 65% had M1c stage disease, 68% with normal LDH, 36% with reported BRAF mutation- positive 
melanom a, and 9% with a history of brain metastases. Among patients with BRAF mutation -positive 
melanom a, 139 (46%) were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor. 
The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS for patients randomized to 
KEYTRUDA as compared to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Table 7 and Figure 1).

Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -Refractory Melanoma (Trial 2)
The safety  and efficacy  of KEYTRUDA were evalua ted in Trial 2, a multicenter, randomized (1:1:1), 
active -controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive one of two doses of KEYTRUDA in a blinded 
fashion or investigator’s choice chemotherapy. The treatment arms consisted of KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg or 
10mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks or investigator’s choice of any of the following chemotherapy 
regimens: dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2intravenously every 3 weeks (26%), temozolomide 200 mg/m2orally 
once daily for 5 days every 28 days(25%), carboplatin AUC 6 i ntravenously plus paclitaxel 225 mg/m2
intravenously every 3 weeks for four cy cles then carboplatin AUC of 5 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2every 
3weeks (25%), paclitaxel 175 mg/m2intravenously every 3 weeks (16%), or carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 
intravenously ever y 3weeks (8%). Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_113779] (0 vs. 1), 
LDH levels (normal vs. elevated [ ≥110% ULN]) and BRAF V600 mutation status (wild- type [W T] or 
19V600E). The trial included patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with progression of 
disease; refractory to two or more doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (3 mg/kg or higher) and, if BRAF V600 mutation -
positive, a BRAF or MEK inhibitor ; and disease progression within [ADDRESS_1225264] dose of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_222055]. The trial excluded patients with uveal melanoma and active brain metastasis. Patients 
received KEYTRU DA until unacceptable toxicity; disease progression that was s ymptom atic, was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_90974], required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was 
confirmed at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging; withdrawal of consent; or physician’s decision to stop 
therapy for the patient. Assessment of tumor status was performed at 12 weeks after randomization, then 
every 6weeks through week 48, followed by [CONTACT_657177] y 12 weeks thereafter. Patients on chemotherapy who 
experienced progression of disease were offered KEYTRUDA. The major efficacy outcomes were 
progression -free survival (PFS) as assessed by [CONTACT_19421] v1.1 and overall survival (OS). 
Additional efficacy  outcome measures were confirmed overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by [CONTACT_557429] v1.1 and duration of response.
The treatment arms consisted of KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg (n=180) or 10 mg/kg (n=181) every 3 weeks or 
investigator’s choice chemotherapy (n=179). Among the 540randomized patients, the median age was 
62years (range : 15 to 89 years), with 43% age 65 or older; 61% male; 98% White; and ECOG 
performance score was 0 (55%) and 1 (45%). Twenty -three percent of patients were BRAF V600 
mutation positive, 40% had elevated LDH at baseline, 82% had M1c disease, and 73% had two or more 
prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_657125]. 
The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to 
KEYTRUDA as compared to control arm (Table 8). There was no statistically significant difference 
between KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg and chemotherapy or between KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg and chemotherapy 
in the interim OS analysis with 220 deaths (59% of required events for the final analysis).

14.2 Non-S mall Cell Lung Cancer
The efficacy  of KEYTRUDA wasinvestigated in a sub -group of a cohort of 280patients enrolled in a 
multicenter, open -label multi-cohort, activity -estimating study (Trial 1). The cohort consisted of patients 
with metastatic NSCLC t hat had progressed following platinum -containing chemotherapy , and if 
appropriate, targeted therapy for ALK or EGFR mutations andany evidence of PD- L1 expression by a 
clinical trial immunohistochemistry  assay . Patients withautoimmune disease ;a medical c ondition that 
required immunosuppression; orwho ha dreceived more than 30Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 
26weeks were ineligible.
A prospectively defined sub-group was retrospectively analyzed using an analytically validated test for 
PD-L1 ex pression tumor proportion score (TPS). This retrospectively identif ied sub -group of 61 patie nts 
accounts for 22% of the 280 patients in the cohort. Patients included in this sub -group had a PD -L1 
21expression T PSofgreater than or equal to 50% tumor cells a s determined by [CONTACT_187284]- L1 IHC 22C3

urgent intervention, occurred wi th a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at [ADDRESS_1225266] 1.1 as assessed by [CONTACT_657178].
Among the 61patients with a TPS greater than or equal to 50% , the baseline characteristics were : 
median age 60 years (34% age 65 or older); 61% male; 79% White; and 34% and 64% with an ECOG PS

incidence of genomic aberrations was EGFR (10%) orALK (0%).
Efficacy  results are summarized in Table 9.The ORR and duration of response were similar regardless of

Response criteria
Solid tumoursGuidelinesABSTRACT
Background: Assessment of the change in tumour burden is an important feature of the
clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics: both tumour shrinkage (objective response)
and disease progression are useful endpoints in clinical trials. Since RECIST was publishedin 2000, many investigators, cooperative groups, industry and government authorities haveadopted these criteria in the assessment of treatment outcomes. However, a number ofquestions and issues have arisen which have led to the development of a revised RECISTguideline (version 1.1). Evidence for changes, summarised in separate papers in this special
issue, has come from assessment of a large data warehouse (>6500 patients), simulation
studies and literature reviews.
Highlights of revised RECIST 1.1: Major changes include: Number of lesions to be assessed : based
on evidence from numerous trial databases merged into a data warehouse for analysis purposes, the number of lesions required to assess tumour burden for response determinationhas been reduced from a maximum of 10 to a maximum of ﬁve total (and from ﬁve to twoper organ, maximum). Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated: nodes
with a short axis ofP15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions.
The short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation oftumour response. Nodes that shrink to <10 mm short axis are considered normal. Conﬁrma

1. Background
1.1. History of RECIST criteria
Assessment of the change in tumour burden is an important
feature of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics. Both
tumour shrinkage (objective response) and time to the development of disease progression are important endpoints in
cancer clinical trials. The use of tumour regression as the
endpoint for phase II trials screening new agents for evidence of anti tumour effect is supported by [CONTACT_337377], for many solid tumours, agentswhich produce tumour shrinkage in a proportion of patientshave a reasonable (albeit imperfect) chance of subsequentlydemonstrating an improvement in overall survival or othertime to event measures in randomised phase III studies (reviewed in [1 4] ). At the current time objective response car
ries with it a body of evidence greater than for any otherbiomarker supporting its utility as a measure of promising
treatment effect in phase II screening trials. Furthermore,
at both the phase II and phase III stage of drug development,clinical trials in advanced disease settings are increasinglyutilising time to progression (or progression free survival)as an endpoint upon which efﬁcacy conclusions are drawn,which is also based on anatomical measurement of tumoursize.
However, both of these tumour endpoints, objective re
sponse and time to disease progression, are useful only ifbased on widely accepted and readily applied standard criteria based on anatomical tumour burden. In 1981 the World
Health Organisation (WHO) ﬁrst published tumour response
criteria, mainly for use in trials where tumour response wasthe primary endpoint. The WHO criteria introduced the concept of an overall assessment of tumour burden by [CONTACT_337378].
5However, in the decades that
followed their publication, cooperative groups and pharmaceutical companies that used the WHO criteria often ‘modiﬁed’ them to accommodate new technologies or to addressareas that were unclear in the original document. This ledto confusion in interpretation of trial results
6and in fact,
the application of varying response criteria was shown to leadto very different conclusions about the efﬁcacy of the sameregimen.
7In response to these problems, an International
Working Party was formed in the mid 1990s to standardiseand simplify response criteria. New criteria, known as RECIST
(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours), were pub
lished in 2000.
8Key features of the original RECIST include
deﬁnitions of minimum size of measurable lesions, instructions on how many lesions to follow (up to 10; a maximumﬁve per organ site), and the use of unidimensional, ratherthan bidimensional, measures for overall evaluation of tumour burden. These criteria have subsequently been widelyadopted by [CONTACT_337379], cooperative groups, andindustry for trials where the primary endpoints are objectiveresponse or progression. In addition, regulatory authoritiesaccept RECIST as an appropriate guideline for these
assessments.
1.2. Why update RECIST?
Since RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators have
conﬁrmed in prospective analyses the validity of substituting
unidimensional for bidimensional (and even three dimensional) based criteria (reviewed in [9]). With rare exceptions
(e.g. mesothelioma), the use of unidimensional criteria seemsto perform well in solid tumour phase II studies.
However, a number of questions and issues have arisen
which merit answers and further clarity. Amongst theseare whether fewer than 10 lesions can be assessed withoutaffecting the overall assigned response for patients (or theconclusion about activity in trials); how to apply RECIST inrandomised phase III trials where progression, not response,is the primary endpoint particularly if not all patients havemeasurable disease; whether or how to utilise newer imaging technologies such as FDG PET and MRI; how to handleassessment of lymph nodes; whether response conﬁrmationis truly needed; and, not least, the applicability of RECIST intrials of targeted non cytotoxic drugs. This revision of the
RECIST guidelines includes updates that touch on all these
points.E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) [ADDRESS_1225273] of the revision processwas to create a database of prospectively documented solidtumour measurement data obtained from industry and academic group trials. This database, assembled at the EORTCData Centre under the leadership of Jan Bogaerts and PatrickTherasse (co authors of this guideline), consists of >6500 patients with >18,[ADDRESS_1225274] of a variety of questions (e.g. number of
target lesions required, the need for response conﬁrmation,
and lymph node measurement rules) on response and progression free survival outcomes. The results of this work,which after evaluation by [CONTACT_337380], are reportedin detail in a separate paper in this special issue.
10Larry Sch
wartz and Robert Ford (also co authors of this guideline) alsoprovided key databases from which inferences have beenmade that inform these revisions.
[ADDRESS_1225275] elected to name [CONTACT_337405]1.1, rather than 2.0.
1.4. What about volumetric or functional assessment?
This raises the question, frequently posed, about whether it is
‘time’ to move from anatomic unidimensional assessment of
tumour burden to either volumetric anatomical assessment
orto functional assessment (e.g. dynamic contrast enhanced
MRI or CT or (18)F ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emissiontomographic (FDG PET) techniques assessing tumour metabolism). As can be seen, the Working Group and particularlythose involved in imaging research, did not believe that thereis at present sufﬁcient standardisation and widespread availability to recommend adoption of these alternative assessment methods. The only exception to this is in the use ofFDG PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progression, as described later in this guideline. As detailed in paper
in this special issue
12, we believe that the use of these prom
ising newer approaches (which could either add to orsubstitute
foranatomical assessment as described in RECIST) requires
appropriate and rigorous clinical validation studies. This pa
per by [CONTACT_337381]. illustrates the type of data that will beneeded to be able to deﬁne ‘endpoints’ for these modalitiesand how to determine where and when such criteria/modalities can be used to improve the reliability with which trulyactive new agents are identiﬁed and truly inactive new agentsare discarded in comparison to RECIST criteria in phase IIscreening trials. The RECIST Working Group looks forwardto such data emerging in the next few years to allow theappropriate changes to the next iteration of the RECISTcriteria.
2. Purpose of this guideline
This guideline describes a standard approach to solid tumour
measurement and deﬁnitions for objective assessment ofchange in tumour size for use in adult and paediatric cancerclinical trials. It is expected these criteria will be useful in alltrials where objective response is the primary study endpoint,as well as in trials where assessment of stable disease, tu
mour progression or time to progression analyses are under
taken, since all of these outcome measures are based on anassessment of anatomical tumour burden and its change onstudy. There are no assumptions in this paper about the proportion of patients meeting the criteria for any of these endpoints which will signal that an agent or treatment regimen isactive: those deﬁnitions are dependent on type of cancer inwhich a trial is being undertaken and the speciﬁc agent(s) under study. Protocols must include appropriate statistical sections which deﬁne the efﬁcacy parameters upon which thetrial sample size and decision criteria are based. In addition
to providing deﬁnitions and criteria for assessment of tumour
response, this guideline also makes recommendationsregarding standard reporting of the results of trials that utilisetumour response as an endpoint.
While these guidelines may be applied in malignant brain
tumour studies, there are also separate criteria published forresponse assessment in that setting.
13This guideline is notin
tended for use for studies of malignant lymphoma sinceinternational guidelines for response assessment in lymphoma are published separately.
14
Finally, many oncologists in their daily clinical practice fol
low their patients’ malignant disease by [CONTACT_337382]. It isnot intended that these RECIST guidelines play a role in thatdecision making, except if determined appropriate by [CONTACT_337383].
3. Measurability of tumour at baseline
3.1. Deﬁnitions
At baseline, tumour lesions/lymph nodes will be categorised
measurable or non measurable as follows:
3.1.1. Measurable
Tumour lesions : Must be accurately measured in at least one
dimension ( longest diameter in the plane of measurement is
to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
•[ADDRESS_1225276] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than5 mm; see Appendix II on imaging guidance).
•10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesionswhich cannot be accurately measured with calipers should
be recorded as non measurable).
•[ADDRESS_1225277] X ray.230 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 247
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically en
larged and measurable, a lymph node must be P15 mm in
short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and infollow up, only the short axis will be measured and followed
(see Schwartz et al. in this Special Issue
15). See also notes be
low on ‘Baseline documentation of target and non target le
sions’ for information on lymph node measurement.
3.1.2. Non-measurable
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter
<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with P10 to <15 mm
short axis) as well as truly non measurable lesions. Lesions
considered truly non measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inﬂammatorybreast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung,abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identiﬁed by[CONTACT_337384].
3.1.3. Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated
with local therapy require particular comment:
Bone lesions:.
•Bone scan, PET scan or plain ﬁlms are not considered ade
quate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to conﬁrm thepresence or disappearance of bone lesions.
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic blastic lesions, with identi
ﬁable soft tissue components , that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_337385]ﬁnition of measurability described above.
•Blastic bone lesions are non measurable.
Cystic lesions:.
•Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically deﬁnedsimple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions(neither measurable nor non measurable) since they are, by[INVESTIGATOR_5328]ﬁnition, simple cysts.
•‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases canbe considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the deﬁnition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment:
•Tumour lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, orin an area subjected to other loco regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols shoulddetail the conditions under which such lesions would be
considered measurable.
3.2. Speciﬁcations by [CONTACT_12009]
3.2.1. Measurement of lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation,
using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluationsshould be performed as close as possible to the treatment
start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning ofthe treatment.
3.2.2. Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique
should be used to characterise each identiﬁed and reportedlesion at baseline and during follow up. Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examinationunless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but areassessable by [CONTACT_461].
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered mea
surable when they are superﬁcial and P10 mm diameter as
assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skinlesions, documentation by [CONTACT_12151] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As notedabove, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_337386], imaging evaluation should be undertaken sinceit is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of thestudy.
Chest X ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X ray, particu
larly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT ismore sensitive than X ray, particularly in identifying new le
sions. However, lesions on chest X ray may be considered
measurable if they are clearly deﬁned and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. See Appendix II for more details.
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible
method to measure lesions selected for response assessment.This guideline has deﬁned measurability of lesions on CTscan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is5 mm or less. As is described in Appendix II , when CT scans
have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum sizefor a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for bodyscans). More details concerning the use of both CT and MRI
for assessment of objective tumour response evaluation are
provided in Appendix II .
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion
size and should not be used as a method of measurement.Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, becausethey are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed thatthe same technique and measurements will be taken fromone assessment to the next (described in greater detail inAppendix II). If new lesions are identiﬁed by [CONTACT_337387], conﬁrmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT,
MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilisation of these techniques for
objective tumour evaluation is not advised. However, they
can be useful to conﬁrm complete pathological responsewhen biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trialswhere recurrence following complete response or surgicalresection is an endpoint.
Tumour markers: Tumour markers alone cannot be used to as
sess objective tumour response. If markers are initially aboveE U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) [ADDRESS_1225278] normalise for a
patient to be considered in complete response. Becausetumour markers are disease speciﬁc, instructions for theirmeasurement should be incorporated into protocols on adisease speciﬁc basis. Speciﬁc guidelines for both CA 125response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (inrecurrent prostate cancer), have been published.
16–18In addi
tion, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA125progression criteria which are to be integrated with objectivetumour assessment for use in ﬁrst line trials in ovariancancer.
19
Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differenti
ate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by [CONTACT_990](for example, residual lesions in tumour types such as germcell tumours, where known residual benign tumours can remain). When effusions are known to be a potential adverseeffect of treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds orangiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological conﬁrmation of the
neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens dur
ing treatment can be considered if the measurable tumourhas met criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive disease.
4. Tumour response evaluation
4.1. Assessment of overall tumour burden and
measurable disease
To assess objective response or future progression, it is nec
essary to estimate the overall tumour burden at baseline and
use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline shouldbe included in protocols where objective tumour responseis the primary endpoint. Measurable disease is deﬁned by[CONTACT_12155] (as detailedabove in Section 3). In studies where the primary endpoint
is tumour progression (either time to progression or propor
tion with progression at a ﬁxed date), the protocol must
specify if entry is restricted to those with measurable diseaseor whether patients having non measurable disease only arealso eligible.
4.2. Baseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non-target’
lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline
all lesions up to a maximum of ﬁve lesions total (and a max
imum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved
organs should be identiﬁed as target lesions and will be re
corded and measured at baseline (this means in instances
where patients have only one or two organ sites involved amaximum of two and four lesions respectively will be re
corded). For evidence to support the selection of only ﬁve target lesions, see analyses on a large prospective database inthe article by [CONTACT_150064].
10.
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size
(lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lendthemselves to reproducible repeated measurements .I tm a yb e
the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance thenext largest lesion which can be measured reproduciblyshould be selected. To illustrate this point see the examplein Fig. [ADDRESS_1225279] in which the imageis obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane;
for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, saggital or
coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis.For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being20 mm ·30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualiﬁes as a
malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm shouldbe recorded as the node measurement (See also the examplein Fig. 4 in Appendix II ). All other pathological nodes (those
with short axis P10 mm but <15 mm) should be considered
non target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis <10 mmare considered non pathological and should not be recordedor followed.
Asum of the diameters (longest for non nodal lesions, short
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculatedand reported as the baseline sum diameters . If lymph nodes
are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only theshort axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters
will be used as reference to further characterise any objectivetumour regression in the measurable dimension of thedisease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological
lymph nodes should be identiﬁed as non target lesions and
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not re
quired and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘ab
sent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more detailsto follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving the same organ as a single item onthe case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymphnodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
4.3. Response criteria
This section provides the deﬁnitions of the criteria used to
determine objective tumour response for target lesions.
4.3.1. Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target ornon target) must have reduction in short axis to<10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference thebaseline sum diameters.232 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 247
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum
of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference
thesmallest sum on study (this includes the baseline
sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition tothe relative increase of 20%, the sum must also dem
onstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. ( Note:
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also
considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufﬁcient shrinkage to qualify for
PR nor sufﬁcient increase to qualify for PD, taking asreference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
4.3.2. Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
Lymph nodes. Lymph nodes identiﬁed as target lesions should
always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (mea
sured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examina
tion), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. Thismeans that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions,the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete responsecriteria are met, since a normal lymph node is deﬁned as havinga short axis of <[ADDRESS_1225280] achieve a short axis <10 mm. For PR,SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes isto be included in the sum of target lesions.
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’. While on
study, all lesions (nodal and non nodal) recorded at baselineshould have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recordedas target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan thatthe radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exactmeasure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’.When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded onthe case report form. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_337331], the measurement should be
recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and isfaintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mmshould be assigned ( Note: It is less likely that this rule will be
used for lymph nodes since they usually have a deﬁnable sizewhen normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_337388]; however, if a lymph node is believed tobe present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance aswell). This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_1225281] slicethickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice
thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially
non reproducible, therefore providing this default value willprevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist isable to
provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even ifit is below 5 mm.
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment. As noted in Appen
dix II, when non nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together tocalculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce,
a plane between them may be maintained that would aid inobtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individ
ual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that theyare no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameterin this instance should be the maximal longest diameter forthe ‘coalesced lesion’.
4.3.3. Evaluation of non-target lesions
This section provides the deﬁnitions of the criteriausedto deter
mine the tumour response for the group of non target lesions.While some non target lesions may actually be measurable,they need not be measured and instead should be assessed onlyqualitatively at the time points speciﬁed in the protocol.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non target le
sions and normalisation of tumour marker level. Alllymph nodes must be non pathological in size(<10 mm short axis).
Non CR/Non PD: Persistence of one or more non target le
sion(s) and/or maintenance of tumour marker levelabove the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see com
ments below) of existing non target lesions. ( Note:
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also
considered progression).
4.3.4. Special notes on assessment of progression of non-
target disease
The concept of progression of non target disease requires
additional explanation as follows:
When the patient also has measurable disease. In this setting,
to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the
non target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumourburden has increased sufﬁciently to merit discontinuationof therapy (see examples in Appendix II and further details
below). A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non target lesions is usually not sufﬁcient to quality for unequivocal
progression status. The designation of overall progression so
lelyon the basis of change in non target disease in the face of
SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
When the patient has only non-measurable disease. This circum
stance arises in some phase III trials when it is not a criterion of
study entry to have measurable disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance thereis no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non measurable disease burden.Because worsening in non target disease cannot be easilyquantiﬁed (by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]ﬁnition: if all lesions are truly non measur
able) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients
for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase inoverall disease burden based on the change in non measurabledisease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that wouldberequiredtodeclare PDfor measurabledisease: i.e. an increasein tumour burden representing an additional 73% increase in‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in ameasurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleuraleffusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangiticE U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 247 233
disease from localised to widespread, or may be described in
protocols as ‘sufﬁcient to require a change in therapy’. Someillustrative examples are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 in Appendix II .
If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would beideal to have objective criteria to apply to non measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do
so, therefore the increase must be substantial.
4.3.5. New lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease
progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new
lesions are important. There are no speciﬁc criteria for theidentiﬁcation of new radiographic lesions; however, the ﬁnding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributableto differences in scanning technique, change in imagingmodality or ﬁndings thought to represent something otherthan tumour (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be
simply healing or ﬂare of pre existing lesions). This is partic
ularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions showpartial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liverlesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cysticlesion, which it is not.
A lesion identiﬁed on a follow up study in an anatomical
location that was notscanned at baseline is considered a new
lesion andwill indicate disease progression. An example of thisis the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while onstudy has a CTor MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases.The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of
PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its
small size, continued therapy and follow up evaluation will
clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans conﬁrm there is deﬁnitely a new lesion, then progression shouldbe declared using the date of the initial scan.
While FDG PET response assessments need additional
study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use ofFDG PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessmentof progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG PET imaging can be identiﬁed
according to the following algorithm:
a. Negative FDG PET at baseline, with a positive
lFDG PET
at follow up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.
b. No FDG PET at baseline and a positive FDG PET at fol
low up:
If the positive FDG PET at follow up corresponds to anew site of disease conﬁrmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.If the positive FDG PET at follow up is not conﬁrmed asa new site of disease on CT, additional follow up CTscans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will bethe date of the initial abnormal FDG PET scan).If the positive FDG PET at follow up corresponds to a
pre existing site of disease on CT that is not progress
ing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.4.4. Evaluation of best overall response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from
the start of the study treatment until the end of treatmenttaking into account any requirement for conﬁrmation. On oc
casion a response may not be documented until after the end
of therapy so protocols should be clear if post treatmentassessments are to be considered in determination of bestoverall response. Protocols must specify how any new therapyintroduced before progression will affect best response designation. The patient’s best overall response assignment willdepend on the ﬁndings of both target and non target diseaseand will also take into consideration the appearance of newlesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the studyand the protocol requirements, it may also require conﬁrmatory measurement (see Section 4.6). Speciﬁcally, in non ran
domised trials where response is the primary endpoint,conﬁrmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the‘best overall response’. This is described further below.
4.4.1. Time point response
It is assumed that at each protocol speciﬁed time point, a re
sponse assessment occurs. Table [ADDRESS_1225282] non measurable (therefore non tar
get) disease only, Table 2 is to be used.
4.4.2. Missing assessments and inevaluable designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular
time point, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at that time point.If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at anassessment, usually the case is also considered NE at thattime point, unless a convincing argument can be made thatthe contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) wouldnot change the assigned time point response. This would bemost likely to happen in the case of PD. For example, if a pa
tient had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_1225283] overall response: all time points
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the
patient is known.
Best response determination in trials where conﬁrmation of com
plete or partial response IS NOT required : Best response in these
trials is deﬁned as the best response across all time points (for
example, a patient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PR at sec
ond assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best overallresponse of PR). When SD is believed to be best response, itmust also meet the protocol speciﬁed minimum time frombaseline. If the minimum time is not met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient’s best responsedepends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a patient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PD at second and doesnot meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best responseof PD. The same patient lost to follow up after the ﬁrst SDassessment would be considered inevaluable.
lA ‘positive’ FDG PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue
on the attenuation corrected image.234 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) [ADDRESS_1225284] response determination in trials where conﬁrmation of com
plete or partial response IS required : Complete or partial re
sponses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are metat a subsequent time point as speciﬁed in the protocol (gener
ally 4 weeks later). In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as in Table 3 .
4.4.4. Special notes on response assessment
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions
and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ size (<10 mm), they may
still have a measurement reported on scans. This measure
ment should be recorded even though the nodes are normalin order not to overstate progression should it be based onincrease in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means thatpatients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on thecase report form (CRF).
In trials where conﬁrmation of response is required, re
peated ‘NE’ time point assessments may complicate best response determination. The analysis plan for the trial mustaddress how missing data/assessments will be addressed indetermination of response and progression. For example, in
most trials it is reasonable to consider a patient with time
point responses of PR NE PR as a conﬁrmed response.
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requir
ing discontinuation of treatment without objective evidenceof disease progression at that time should be reported as‘symptomatic deterioration’. Every effort should be made todocument objective progression even after discontinuationof treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is nota descriptor
of an objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003]. The objective response status of such patients is to bedetermined by [CONTACT_876873] 1 3 .
Conditions that deﬁne ‘early progression, early death and
inevaluability’ are study speciﬁc and should be clearly de
scribed in each protocol (depending on treatment duration,treatment periodicity).
In some circumstances it may be difﬁcult to distinguish
residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation ofcomplete response depends upon this determination, it isrecommended that the residual lesion be investigated (ﬁne

a If a CR is truly met at ﬁrst time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline,
makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best response would depend on whether minimum duration
for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the
patient had PR, not CR at the ﬁrst time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.Table 1 – Time point response: patients with target (+/–

a ‘Non CR/non PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non target

of efﬁcacy in some trials so to assign this category when no

needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before assigning a status of complete
response. FDG PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CRin a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residualradiographic abnormality is thought to represent ﬁbrosis orscarring. The use of FDG PET in this circumstance should beprospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_337390]ﬁc medical literature for the indication. However, it
must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to
false positive CR due to limitations of FDG PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.
For equivocal ﬁndings of progression (e.g. very small and
uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or necrosis in existinglesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduledassessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progressionis conﬁrmed, the date of progression should be the earlierdate when progression was suspected.
4.5. Frequency of tumour re-evaluation
Frequency of tumour re evaluation while on treatment
should be protocol speciﬁc and adapted to the type and schedule of treatment. However, in the context of phase II studieswhere the beneﬁcial effect of therapy is not known, follow upevery 6 8 weeks (timed to coincide with the end of a cycle) isreasonable. Smaller or greater time intervals than these couldbe justiﬁed in speciﬁc regimens or circumstances. The protocol should specify which organ sites are to be evaluated atbaseline (usually those most likely to be involved with metastatic disease for the tumour type under study) and how often
evaluations are repeated. Normally, all target and non target
sites are evaluated at each assessment. In selected circumstances certain non target organs may be evaluated less frequently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeatedonly when complete response is identiﬁed in target diseaseor when progression in bone is suspected.
After the end of the treatment, the need for repetitive tu
mour evaluations depends on whether the trial has as a goalthe response rate or the time to an event (progression/death).If ‘time to an event’ (e.g. time to progression, disease freesurvival, progression free survival) is the main endpoint of
the study, then routine scheduled re evaluation of protocol
speciﬁed sites of disease is warranted. In randomised comparative trials in particular, the scheduled assessmentsshould be performed as identiﬁed on a calendar schedule(for example: every 6 8 weeks on treatment or every 3 4months after treatment) and should not be affected by [CONTACT_337391], drug holidays or any other events that might leadto imbalance in a treatment arm in the timing of diseaseassessment.
4.6. Conﬁrmatory measurement/duration of response
4.6.1. Conﬁrmation
In non randomised trials where response is the primary end
point, conﬁrmation of PR and CR is required to ensure re
sponses identiﬁed are not the result of measurement error.This will also permit appropriate interpretation of results inthe context of historical data where response has traditionallyrequired conﬁrmation in such trials (see the paper by [CONTACT_337392]. in this Special Issue
10). However, in all other circumstances, i.e. in randomised trials (phase II or III) or studieswhere stable disease or progression are the primary endpoints,conﬁrmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the interpretation of trial results. However, elimination ofthe requirement for response conﬁrmation may increase theimportance of central review to protect against bias, in particular in studies which are not blinded.
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD
criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval(in general not less than 6 8 weeks) that is deﬁned in thestudy protocol.
4.6.2. Duration of overall response
The duration of overall response is measured from the time
measurement criteria are ﬁrst met for CR/PR (whichever is ﬁrstrecorded) until the ﬁrst date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study).
The duration of overall complete response is measured
from the time measurement criteria are ﬁrst met for CR untilthe ﬁrst date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.
4.6.3. Duration of stable disease
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in
randomised trials, from date of randomisation) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest
sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the
reference for calculation of PD).
The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease var
ies in different studies and diseases. If the proportion of patients achieving stable disease for a minimum period of timeis an endpoint of importance in a particular trial, the protocolshould specify the minimal time interval required betweentwo measurements for determination of stable disease.
Note: The duration of response and stable disease as well as
theprogression free survival are inﬂuenced by [CONTACT_337393]. It is not in the scope of thisguideline to deﬁne a standard follow up frequency. The frequency should take into account many parameters includingdisease types and stages, treatment periodicity and standard
practice. However, these limitations of the precision of the
measured endpoint should be taken into account if comparisons between trials are to be made.
4.7. Progression-free survival/proportion progression-free
4.7.1. Phase II trials
This guideline is focused primarily on the use of objective re
sponse endpoints for phase II trials. In some circumstances, ‘re
sponse rate’ may not be the optimal method to assess thepotential anticancer activity of new agents/regimens. In such
cases ‘progression free survival’ (PFS) or the ‘proportion pro
gression free’ at landmark time points, might be consideredappropriate alternatives to provide an initial signal of biologiceffect of new agents. It is clear, however, that in an uncontrolledtrial, these measures are subject to criticism since an apparently promising observation may be related to biological factorssuch as patient selection and not theimpact of theintervention.Thus, phase II screening trials utilising these endpoints are bestdesigned with a randomised control. Exceptions may exist236 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 247
where the behaviour patterns of certain cancers are so consis
tent (and usually consistently poor), that a non randomisedtrial is justiﬁable (see for example van Glabbeke et al.
20). How
ever, in these cases it will be essential to document with carethe basis for estimating the expected PFS or proportion progression free in the absence of a treatment effect.
4.7.2. Phase III trials
Phase III trials in advanced cancers are increasingly designed
to evaluate progression free survival or time to progression asthe primary outcome of interest. Assessment of progressionis relatively straightforward if the protocol requires all patients to have measurable disease. However, restricting entryto this subset of patients is subject to criticism: it may resultin a trial where the results are less likely to be generalisable if,in the disease under study, a substantial proportion of patients would be excluded. Moreover, the restriction to entrywill slow recruitment to the study. Increasingly, therefore, tri
als allow entry of both patients with measurable disease as
well as those with non measurable disease only. In this circumstance, care must be taken to explicitly describe the ﬁndings which would qualify for progressive disease for thosepatients without measurable lesions. Furthermore, in this set
ting, protocols must indicate if the maximum number of recorded target lesions for those patients with measurabledisease may be relaxed from ﬁve to three (based on the datafound in Bogaerts et al.
10and Moskowitz et al.11). As found in
the ‘special notes on assessment of progression’, these guidelines offer recommendations for assessment of progression
in this setting. Furthermore, if available, validated tumour mar
ker measures of progression (as has been proposed for ovariancancer) may be useful to integrate into the deﬁnition of progression. Centralised blinded review of imaging studies or ofsource imaging reports to verify ‘unequivocal progression’may be needed if important drug development or drug approval decisions are to be based on the study outcome. Finally,as noted earlier, because the date of progression is subject toascertainment bias, timing of investigations in study armsshould be the same. The article by [CONTACT_337394]. in this specialissue
21provides a more detailed discussion of the assessment
of progression in randomised trials.
4.8. Independent review of response and progression
For trials where objective response (CR + PR) is the primary end
point, and in particular where key drug development decisions are based on the observation of a minimum number ofresponders, it is recommended that all claimed responses bereviewed by [CONTACT_13461](s) independent of the study. If the studyis a randomised trial, ideally reviewers should be blinded totreatment assignment. Simultaneous review of the patients’
ﬁles and radiological images is the best approach.
Independent review of progression presents some more
complex issues: for example, there are statistical problems
with the use of central review based progression time inplace of investigator based progression time due to the potential introduction of informative censoring when the formerprecedes the latter. An overview of these factors and otherlessons learned from independent review is provided in anarticle by [CONTACT_337395]. in this special issue.
224.9. Reporting best response results
4.9.1. Phase II trials
When response is the primary endpoint, and thus all patients
must have measurable disease to enter the trial, all patients
included in the study must be accounted for in the report of
the results, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are not evaluable. Each patient will be assignedone of the following categories:
1. Complete response2. Partial response3. Stable disease4. Progression5. Inevaluable for response: specify reasons (for example: early
death, malignant disease; early death, toxicity; tumourassessments not repeated/incomplete; other (specify)).
Normally, all eligible patients should be included in the
denominator for the calculation of the response rate for phaseII trials (in some protocols it will be appropriate to include all
treated patients). It is generally preferred that 95% two sided
conﬁdence limits are given for the calculated response rate.Trial conclusions should be based on the response rate forall eligible (or all treated) patients and should notbe based
on a selected ‘evaluable’ subset.
4.9.2. Phase III trials
Response evaluation in phase III trials may be an indicator
of the relative anti tumour activity of the treatments evaluated and is almost always a secondary endpoint. Observed differences in response rate may not predict theclinically relevant therapeutic beneﬁt for the populationstudied. If objective response is selected as a primary endpoint for a phase III study (only in circumstances where adirect relationship between objective tumour response anda clinically relevant therapeutic beneﬁt can be unambigu
ously demonstrated for the population studied), the same
criteria as those applying to phase II trials should be usedand all patients entered should have at least one measurable lesion.
In those many cases where response is a secondary end
point and not all trial patients have measurable disease, themethod for reporting overall best response rates must bepre speciﬁed in the protocol. In practice, response rate maybe reported using either an ‘intent to treat’ analysis (all randomised patients in the denominator) or an analysis whereonly the subset of patients with measurable disease atbaseline are included. The protocol should clearly specify
how response results will be reported, including any subset
analyses that are planned.
The original version of RECIST suggested that in phase III
trials one could write protocols using a ‘relaxed’ interpretation of the RECIST guidelines (for example, reducing the number of lesions measured) but this should no longer be donesince these revised guidelines have been amended in such away that it is clear how these criteria should be applied forall trials in which anatomical assessment of tumour responseor progression are endpoints.E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) [ADDRESS_1225285] 1.1 Rationale Reference in special issue

Appendix II. Speciﬁcations for standard
anatomical radiological imaging
These protocols for image acquisition of computed tomogra
phy (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are recommendations intended for patients on clinical trials where
RECIST assessment will be performed. Standardisation ofimaging requirements and image acquisition parameters isideal to allow for optimal comparability of subjects within astudy and results between studies. These recommendationsare designed to balance optimised image acquisition protocols with techniques that should be feasible to perform glob
ally at imaging facilities in all types of radiology practices.
These guidelines are not applicable to functional imagingtechniques or volumetric assessment of tumour size.
Scanner quality control is highly recommended and should
follow standard manufacturer and facility maintenanceschedules using commercial phantoms. It is likely that for RECIST unidimensional measurements this will be adequate toproduce reproducible measurements. Imaging quality controlfor CT includes an analysis of image noise and uniformity andCT number as well as spatial resolution. The frequency ofquality control analysis is also variable and should focus on
clinically relevant scanning parameters. Dose analysis is al
ways important and the use of imaging should follow theALARA principle, ‘As Low As Reasonably Achievable’, whichrefers to making every reasonable effort to maintain radiationexposures as far below the dose limits as possible.
Speciﬁc notes
Chest X ray measurement of lesions surrounded by [CONTACT_337397], but not preferable as themeasurement represents a summation of densities. Further
more, there is poor identiﬁcation of new lesions within the
chest on X ray as compared with CT. Therefore, measurements of pulmonary parenchymal lesions as well as mediastinal disease are optimally performed with CT of the chest.MRI of the chest should only be performed in extenuating circumstances. Even if IV contrast cannot be administered (forexample, in the situation of allergy to contrast), a non contrast CT of the chest is still preferred over MRI or chest X ray.
CT scans: CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should
be contiguous throughout all the anatomic region of interest.As a general rule, the minimum size of a measurable lesion at
baseline should be no less than double the slice thickness and
also have a minimum size of 10 mm (see below for minimumsize when scanners have a slice thickness more than 5 mm).While the precise physics of lesion size and partial volumeaveraging is complex, lesions smaller than [ADDRESS_1225290] studies, they should still be measured.Lesions which are reported as ‘too small to measure’ shouldbe assigned a default measurement of [ADDRESS_1225291] administration, slice thickness, and reconstruction interval.
a.Anatomic coverage: Optimal anatomic coverage for mostsolid tumours is the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Coverage should encompass all areas of known predilectionfor metastases in the disease under evaluation and240 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) [ADDRESS_1225292] administration : Optimal visualisation and
measurement of metastases in solid tumours requiresconsistent administration (dose and rate) of IV contrastas well as timing of scanning. T ypi[INVESTIGATOR_897], most abdominal imaging is performed during the portal venousphase and (optimally) about the same time frame afterinjection on each examination (see Fig. [ADDRESS_1225293] on lesion measurement).Most solid tumours may be scanned with a singlephase after administration of contrast. While triphasicCT scans are sometimes performed on other types ofvascular tumours to improve lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], forconsistency and uniformity, we would recommend triphasic CT for hepatocellular and neuroendocrinetumours for which this scanning protocol is generallystandard of care, and the improved temporal resolutionof the triphasic scan will enhance the radiologists’ ability to consistently and reproducibly measure these
lesions. The precise dose and rate of IV contrast is
dependent upon the CT scanning equipment, CT acquisition protocol, the type of contrast used, the availablevenous access and the medical condition of thepatient. Therefore, the method of administration ofintravenous contrast agents is variable. Rather thantry to institute rigid rules regarding methods foradministering contrast agents and the volume injected,it is appropriate to suggest that an adequate volume ofa suitable contrast agent should be given so that themetastases are demonstrated to best effect and a con
sistent method is used on subsequent examinations for
any given patient (ideally, this would be speciﬁed inthe protocol or for an institution). It is very importantthat the same technique be used at baseline and on follow up examinations for a given patient. This willgreatly enhance the reproducibility of the tumour measurements. If prior to enrolment it is known a patient isnot able to undergo CT scans with IV contrast due toallergy or renal insufﬁciency, the decision as to
whether a non contrast CT or MRI (with or without IV
contrast) should be used to evaluate the subject atbaseline and follow up should be guided by [CONTACT_337398]. For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done,the decision as to whether non contrast CT or MRI(enhanced or non enhanced) should be performedshould also be based on the tumour type, anatomiclocation of the disease and should be optimised toallow for comparison to the prior studies if possible.
Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to
determine if substitution of these other approaches ispossible and, if not, the patient should be considerednot evaluable from that point forward. Care must betaken in measurement of target lesions on a differentmodality and interpretation of non target disease ornew lesions, since the same lesion may appear to havea different size using a new modality (see Fig. [ADDRESS_1225294] and MRI of the same lesion). Oralcontrast is recommended to help visualise and differentiate structures in the abdomen.
c.Slice thickness and reconstruction interval: RECIST measurements may be performed at most clinically obtainedslice thicknesses. It is recommended that CT scans beperformed at [ADDRESS_1225295] on lesion measurement and on detection ofnew lesions. However, consideration should also begiven for minimising radiation exposure. With theseparameters, a minimum 10 mm lesion is considered
measurable at baseline. Occasionally, institutions may
perform medically acceptable scans at slice thicknessesgreater than 5 mm. If this occurs, the minimum size of
measurable lesions at baseline should be twice the slice

FDG PET has gained acceptance as a valuable tool for
detecting, staging and restaging several malignancies. Criteriafor incorporating (or substituting) FDG PET into anatomicalassessment of tumour response in phase II trials are not yetavailable, though much research is ongoing. Nevertheless,FDG PET is being used in many drug development trials bothas a tool to assess therapeutic efﬁcacy and also in assessmentof progression. If FDG PET scans are included in a protocol, by[CONTACT_21128], an FDG uptake period of [ADDRESS_1225297] injection. PET camera speciﬁcations arevariable and manufacturer speciﬁc, so every attempt shouldbe made to use the same scanner, or the same model scanner,for serial scans on the same patient. Whole body acquisitionscan be performed in either 2 or 3 dimensional mode with
attenuation correction, but the method chosen should be con
sistent across all patients and serial scans in the clinical trial.
PET/CT scans : Combined modality scanning such as with
PET CT is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a modality/technology that is in rapid evolution; therefore, the recommendations in this paper may change rather quickly withtime. At present, low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined PET CT are of limited use in anatomicallybased efﬁcacy assessments and it is therefore suggested thatthey should not be substituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomically based RECIST mea
surements. However, if a site can document that the CTperformed as part of a PET CT is of identical diagnostic qual
ity to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CTportion of the PET CT can be used for RECIST measurements.Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinelyor serially performed.
Ultrasound examinations should not be used in clinical trials
to measure tumour regression or progression of lesions be
cause the examination is necessarily subjective and operator
dependent. The reasons for this are several: Entire examinations cannot be reproduced for independent review at a laterdate, and it must be assumed, whether or not it is the case,that the hard copy ﬁlms available represent a true and accurate reﬂection of events. Furthermore, if, for example, theonly measurable lesion is in the para aortic region of theabdomen and if gas in the bowel overlies the lesion, the lesionwill not be detected because the ultrasound beam cannotpenetrate the gas. Accordingly, the disease staging (or restaging for treatment evaluation) for this patient will not be
accurate.
While evaluation of lesions by [CONTACT_337399], it is permitted when lesions are
superﬁcial, at least [ADDRESS_1225298], spatial and temporal resolution; however, thereare many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_337336]. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variableglobally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technicalspeciﬁcations of the scanning sequences used should beoptimised for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow upshould be the same as was used at baseline and the lesionsshould be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.Generally, axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with T1and T2 weighted imaging along with gadolinium enhancedimaging should be performed. The ﬁeld of view, matrix,

ciﬁc body part being imaged as well as the scanner utilised. It
is beyond the scope of this document or appendix to prescribe speciﬁc MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts and diseases. Ideally, the same type ofscanner should be used and the image acquisition protocolshould be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Bodyscans should be performed with breath hold scanning tech
niques if possible.
Selection of target lesions : In general, the largest lesions rep
resentative of involved organs (up to a maximum of two per
organ and ﬁve total) are selected to follow as target lesions.However, in some cases, the largest lesions may not be easilymeasured and are not suitable for follow up because of theirconﬁguration. In these cases, identiﬁcation of the largest most
reproducible lesions is advised. Fig. [ADDRESS_1225299] and follow:
Measurement of lesions
The longest diameter of selected lesions should be measured
in the plane in which the images were acquired. For body CT,this is the axial plane. In the event isotropic reconstructionsare performed, measurements can be made on these reconstructed images; however, it should be cautioned that notall radiology sites are capable of producing isotropic reconstructions. This could lead to the undesirable situation ofmeasurements in the axial plane at one assessment pointand in a different plane at a subsequent assessment. There
are some tumours, for instance paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_18179], which
are better measured in the coronal or sagittal plane. It wouldbe acceptable to measure these lesions in these planes if thereconstructions in those planes were isotropic or the imageswere acquired with MRI in those planes. Using the same planeof evaluation, the maximal diameter of each target lesionshould always be measured at subsequent follow up timepoints even if this results in measuring the lesion at a different slice level or in a different orientation or vector comparedwith the baseline study. Software tools that calculate the
maximal diameter for a perimeter of a tumour may be em
ployed and may even reduce variability.
The only exception to the longest diameter rule is lymph
node measurement. Because malignant nodes are identiﬁedby [CONTACT_337400], this is the guide used todetermine not only whether they are pathological but is alsothe dimension measured for adding into the sum of target lesions. Fig. 4 illustrates this point: the large arrow identiﬁes a
malignant node: the shorter perpendicular axis is P15 mm
and will be recorded. Close by (small arrow) there is a normalnode: note here the long axis is greater than 10 mm but the
short axis is well below 10 mm. This node should be consid
ered non pathological.
If a lesion disappears and reappears at a subsequent time
point it should continue to be measured. However, the patient’s response at the point in time when the lesion reappears will depend upon the status of his/her other lesions.For example, if the patient’s tumour had reached a CR statusand the lesion reappeared, then the patient would be considered PD at the time of reappearance. In contrast, if the tumourstatus was a PR or SD and one lesion which had disappearedthen reappears, its maximal diameter should be added to the
sum of the remaining lesions for a calculated response: in
other words, the reappearance of an apparently ‘disappeared’single lesion amongst many which remain is not in itself en
Fig. 3 – Largest lesion may not be most reproducible: most reproducible should be selected as target. In this example, theprimary gastric lesion (circled at baseline and at follow-up in the top two images) may be able to be measured with thinsection volumetric CT with the same degree of gastric distention at baseline and follow-up. However, this is potentiallychallenging to reproduce in a multicentre trial and if attempted should be done with careful imaging input and analysis. Themost reproducible lesion is a lymph node (circled at baseline and at follow-up in the bottom two images).E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 247 243
ough to qualify for PD: that requires the sum of all lesions to
meet the PD criteria. The rationale for such a categorisation isbased upon the realisation that most lesions do not actually‘disappear’ but are not visualised because they are beyondthe resolving power of the imaging modality employed.
The identiﬁcation of the precise boundary deﬁnition of a
lesion may be difﬁcult especially when the lesion is embedded in an organ with a similar contrast such as the liver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal or spleen. Additionally, peritumouraloedema may surround a lesion and may be difﬁcult to distinguish on certain modalities between this oedema and actualtumour. In fact, pathologically, the presence of tumour cellswithin the oedema region is variable. Therefore, it is mostcritical that the measurements be obtained in a reproducible
manner from baseline and all subsequent follow up time
points. This is also a strong reason to consistently utilisethe same imaging modality.
When lesions ‘fragment’, the individual lesion diameters
should be added together to calculate the target lesionsum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between themmay be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximaldiameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instanceshould be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘merged
lesion’.
Progression of non-target lesions
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ there must be an overall
level of substantial worsening in non target disease that is of
a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in targetdisease, the treating physician would feel it important tochange therapy. Examples of unequivocal progression areshown in Figs. 5 and 6.

Appendix III. Frequently asked questions
Question Answer
What should be done if several unique lesions at
baseline become conﬂuent at a follow up
evaluation?Measure the longest diameter of the conﬂuent mass and record to add into the sum of
the longest diameters
How large does a new lesion have to be to countas progression? Does any small subcentimetre
lesion qualify, or should the lesion be at least
measurable?New lesions do not need to meet ‘measurability criteria’ to be considered valid. If it isclear on previous images (with the same technique) that a lesion was absent then its
deﬁnitive appearance implies progression. If there is any doubt (because of the
techniques or conditions) then it is suggested that treatment continue until nextscheduled assessment when, generally, all should be clear. Either it gets bigger and the
date of progression is the date of the ﬁrst suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798], or it disappears and one may then
consider it an artefact with the support of the radiologists
How should one lesion be measured if on
subsequent exams it is split into two?Measure the longest diameter of each lesion and add this into the sum
Does the deﬁnition of progression depend on
the status of all target lesions or only one?As per the RECIST 1.1 guideline, progression requires a 20% increase in the sum ofdiameters of all target lesions AND a minimum absolute increase of [ADDRESS_1225300] criteria accepted by [CONTACT_337401]?Many cooperative groups and members of pharma were involved in preparing RECIST1.[ADDRESS_1225301] adopted them. The FDA was consulted in their development and supportstheir use, though they don’t require it. The European and Canadian regulatory
authorities also participated and the RECIST criteria are now integrated in the European
note for guidance for the development of anticancer agents. Many pharmaceuticalcompanies are also using them. RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1225302] slice thickness is >5 mm?RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1225303] a maximum slice thickness of 5 mm and theminimum size for a measurable lesion is twice that: 10 mm (even if slice thickness is
<5 mm). If scanners with slice thickness >[ADDRESS_1225304] when target lesions
become so small they are below the 10 mm
‘measurable’ size?Target lesion measurability is deﬁned at baseline. Thereafter, actual measurements,
even if <10 mm, should be recorded. If lesions become very small, some radiologists
indicate they are ‘too small to measure’. This guideline advises that when this occurs, ifthe lesion is actually still present, a default measurement of [ADDRESS_1225305]
decreased in size to meet PR criteria and one
has actually disappeared, does that patient havePD if the ‘disappeared’ lesion reappears?Unless the sum meets the PD criteria, the reappearance of a lesion in the setting of PR (or
SD) is not PD. The lesion should simply be added into the sum.
If the patients had had a CR, clearly reappearance of an absent lesion would qualify forPD
When measuring the longest diameter of targetlesions in response to treatment, is the sameaxis that was used initially used subsequently,
even if there is a shape change to the lesion that
may have produced a new longest diameter?The longest diameter of the lesion should always be measured even if the actual axis isdifferent from the one used to measure the lesion initially (or at different time pointduring follow up)
The only exception to this is lymph nodes: as per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1225306] been selected at baselineand followed but then one of these targetlesions then becomes non evaluable (i.e.different technique used)What may be done in such cases is one of the following:
What is the effect this has on the other targetlesions and the overall response?(a) If the patient is still being treated, call the centre to be sure that future evaluations aredone with the baseline technique so at least SOME courses are fully evaluable(b) If that is not possible, check if there IS a baseline exam by [CONTACT_337402]...in which case if you retrieve the baseline measures from
that technique you retrieve the lesion evaluability
(c) If neither (a) nor (b) is possible then it is a judgement call about whether you deletethe lesion from all forms or consider the impact of the lesion overall is so important that
its being non evaluable makes the overall response interpretation inevaluable without
it. Such a decision should be discussed in a review panelIt is NOT recommended that the lesion be included in baseline sums and then excludedfrom follow up sums since this biases in favour of a response

Question Answer
What if a single non target lesion cannot be reviewed, for
whatever reason; does this negate the overall assessment?Sometimes the major contribution of a single non target lesion may be inthe setting of CR having otherwise been achieved: failure to examine one
non target in that setting will leave you unable to claim CR. It is also
possible that the non target lesion has undergone such substantialprogression that it would override the target disease and render patientPD. However, this is very unlikely, especially if the rest of the measurable
disease is stable or responding
A patient has a 32% decrease in sum cycle 2, a 28% decrease cycle4 and a 33% decrease cycle 6. Does conﬁrmation of PR have to
take place in sequential scans or is a case like this conﬁrmed PR?It is not infrequent that tumour shrinkage hovers around the 30% mark.
In this case, most would consider PR to have been conﬁrmed looking at
this overall case. Had there been two or three non PR observationsbetween the two time point PR responses, the most conservativeapproach would be to consider this case SD
In the setting of a breast cancer neoadjuvant study, wouldmammography not be used to assess lesions? Is CT preferred inthis setting?Neither CT nor mammography are optimal in this setting. MRI is thepreferred modality to follow breast lesions in a neoadjuvant setting
A patient has a lesion measurable by [CONTACT_337403]. Which should be followed?CT scan. Always follow by [CONTACT_337404]ﬁed
A lesion which was solid at baseline has become necrotic in thecentre. How should this be measured?The longest diameter of the entire lesion should be followed. Eventually,necrotic lesions which are responding to treatment decrease in size. Inreporting the results of trials, you may wish to report on this
phenomenon if it is seen frequently since some agents (e.g. angiogenesis
inhibitors) may produce this effect
If I am going to use MRI to follow disease, what is minimum size
for measurability?MRI may be substituted for contrast enhanced CT for some sites, but notlung. The minimum size for measurability is the same as for CT (10 mm)
as long as the scans are performed with slice thickness of [ADDRESS_1225311]? At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a
combined PET CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for usewith RECIST measurements. However, if your site has documented thatthe CT performed as part of a PET CT is of the same diagnostic quality as
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the PET CT can be used
for RECIST measurements. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CTintroduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is notroutinely or serially performed246 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) [ADDRESS_1225312], Cascino TL, Schold Jr SC, Cairncross JG.

ADAPTATION OF THE  
IMMUNE-RELATED RESPONSE 
CRITERIA: irRECIST
Oliver Bohnsack, PAREXEL 
Katarina Ludajic, PAREXEL Axel Hoos, [COMPANY_004]ESMO [ADDRESS_1225319] 1.1 in immunotherapy trials  would lead to declaration  of progressive disease  (PD) too early, when the treatment effect is not yet fully evident. RECIST also neglects the importance  of the ‘flare effect’ -  pseudo-progression  effect within the so-called flare time window. 
Immune related Response 
Criteria (irRC) based on  WHO criteria were published with an aim to provide better assessment of the effect  of immunotherapeutic agents. With this poster we introduce irRECIST based on RECIST 1.1, irRC and Nishino et al., [ADDRESS_1225320] by [CONTACT_657194]: central discordance.AIM

These include bone metastases, leptomeningeal metastases, malignant ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, ill-defined abdominal masses, skin lesions, etc.Although irRC does not specifically define non-target lesions, irRC is derived from WHO criteria and indicates accordance with the same for the purposes of definitions of  non-target lesions. Further clarifications in alignment with  RECIST 1.1 are provided.

and non-target lymph nodes from  RECIST 1.1.
Not specified. 1.3 Baseline: Non-Target  Lesion Selection
All lesions or sites of disease not  
recorded as target lesions should  be recorded as non-target lesions  at baseline. There is no limit to the number of non-target lesions that  can be recorded at baseline.In alignment with RECIST 1.1, all  malignant lesions have to be selected at baseline. The excess of measurable lesions and all true non-measurable lesions will be selected as non-target lesions at baseline and followed at subsequent timepoints.

Not specified. 1.6 Baseline: Cystic and Necrotic 
Lesions as Target Lesions
Lesions that are partially cystic or 
necrotic can be selected as target lesions. The longest diameter of such a lesion will be added to the Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB) of  all target lesions at baseline. If other lesions with a non-liquid/non-necrotic component are present, those should be preferred. RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1225323].
Not specified. 1.7 Baseline: Lesions With Prior  Local Treatment
During target lesion selection the 
radiologist will consider information on the anatomical sites of previous intervention (e.g. previous irradiation, RF-ablation, TACE, surgery, etc.). Lesions undergoing prior intervention will not be selected as target lesions unless there has been a demon-stration of progress in the lesion.In order to minimize site vs. central discrepancy information about prior intervention needs to be available  to both the investigators and independent reviewers. 
Not specified. 1.8 Baseline: No Disease at Baseline 
If a patient has no measurable and  
no non-measurable disease at  baseline the radiologist will assign  ‘No Disease’ (irND) as the overall  tumor assessment for any available follow-up timepoints unless new  measurable lesions are identified and contribute to the TMTB.irND is a valid assessment in studies with adjuvant setting where the  protocol and study design allow to  include patients with no visible  disease. This had not been addressed at all in any prior immune-response related criteria but needs to be  included to also allow for these  patients to be assessed accurately.
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of the index lesions and of new, measurable lesions (≥5×5 mm; up to 5 new  lesions per organ: 5 new cutaneous lesions and 10 visceral lesions) are added together to provide the total tumor burden:
SPDindex lesions + SPDnew measured lesion2.0 Follow-up: Recording of  Target and New Measureable  Lesion Measurements
The longest diameters of non-nodal 
target and new non-nodal measurable lesions, and short axes of nodal target and new nodal measurable lesions will be recorded. T ogether they determine 
the Total Measured  Tumor Burden 
(TMTB) at follow-up.In alignment with Nishino et al., 2013,  unidimensional measurements are used. Measurements of all measured lesions (baseline-selected target  lesions and new measurble lesions) are combined into TMTB at follow-up.
2.1 Follow-up: Definition of  Measurable New Lesions
In order to be selected as new mea-
surable lesions (≤ 2 lesions per organ, ≤ 5 lesions total, per timepoint), new lesions must meet criteria as defined for baseline target lesion selection  and meet the same minimum size  requirements of [ADDRESS_1225324] 10 mm  each verus 10 new measurable lesions  as suggested in the irRC criteria is due to the following: [ADDRESS_1225325] a 20% increase in TMTB compared to nadir, this would mean that for irPD assessment the nadir TMTB had to be [ADDRESS_1225326]  of the TMTB %-increase by [CONTACT_657195], to support  a most conservative approach.
4irRECIST criteria are based 
on irRC criteria adapted for unidimensional measure-ments, as outlined in Nishino et al., 2013. To further align the criteria with RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1225327]  
Modifications and ClarificationsRationale for Modification
Non-index lesions at follow-up 
timepoints contribute to defining irCR (complete disappearance required).2.2 Follow-up: Non-Target  Lesion Assessment 
The RECIST 1.1 definitions for  
the assessment of non-target  lesions apply.
The response of non-target lesions 
primarily contributes to the overall response assessments of irCR and irNon-CR/Non-PD (irNN). Non-target lesions do not affect irPR and irSD assessments. Only a massive and unequivocal worsening of non-target lesions alone, even without progress  in the TMTB is indicative of irPD. Non-target lesions have a subordinate function. In the event that non-target lesions massively progress one cannot ignore such worsening and in these rare cases irPD based only on  non-target lesions will be a valid assessment option. 
New, non-measurable lesions at follow-up timepoints do not define progression, they only preclude irCR.2.3 Follow-up: New Non-Measurable Lesions Definition and Assessment
All new lesions not selected as new 
measurable lesions are considered  new non-measurable lesions and are followed qualitatively. Only a massive  and unequivocal progression of new non-measurable lesions leads to an overall assessment of irPD for the timepoint. Persisting new non-measurable lesions prevent irCR.When new non-measurable lesions substantially worsen in these rare cases irPD based only on new  non-measurable lesions will be  an assessment option.

An irPD confirmation scan may be  
recommended for patients with a  minimal TMTB %-increase over  20% and especially during the flare time-window of the first [ADDRESS_1225332] criteria as outlined here introduce the needed clarifications and adjustments to irRC 
criteria and Nishino et al., 2013 publication to allow for treatment evaluations that better meet both investigators’ and patients’ needs and with that better reflect sponsors’ demands for more reliable and reproducible study data in targeted immunotherapy in oncology studies. The main adaptation of the existing immune-response criteira lies in the assessment of all detected lesions. Unequivocal and substantial increase of non-target and new non-measurable lesions prevents irCR and may also lead to irPD. Reduction of the tumor burden in patients in an adjuvant setting may lead to irPR and such patients may therefore be enrolled in studies with response endpoints.
Clinical relevance of these adaptations needs to be confirmed.CONCLUSIONS
6 1.  TMTB: Baseline-selected target lesions and new measurable 
lesions should NOT be assessed separately. Measurements of those lesions should be combined into the Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB), and one combined assessment provided.
2.  New Measurable Lesions: According to irRC a measurable new lesion has to be at least [ADDRESS_1225333], criteria for unidimensional lesion measurment apply to both target and new measurable lesions: a minimum [ADDRESS_1225334] diameter for non-nodal lesions, and a minimum 15 mm in short axis for lymph nodes. Smaller lesions contribute to the non-target or new non-measurable tumor burden, but do not get measured.
3.  irPR if no Target Lesions: If new measurable lesions appear  in patients with no target lesions at baseline, irPD will be assessed. That irPD timepoint will be considered a new baseline, and all subsequent timepoints will be compared  to it for response assessment. irPR is possible if the TMTB  of new measurable lesions decreases by ≥ 30% compared  to the first irPD documentation. 
4.  irPR in Adjuvant Studies: irRECIST can be used in the adjuvant setting, in patients with no visible disease on CT/MRI scans. The appearance of new measurable lesion(s) automatically leads to an increase in TMTB by 100% and leads to irPD. These patients can achieve a response if the TMTB decreases at follow-up, as a sign of delayed response.   Considering 3 and 4, sponsors may consider enrolling patients with no measurable disease and/or patients with no visible disease at all in studies with response related endpoints.  
    5.  Non-Target Lesions: In alignment with RECIST 1.1, baseline selected non-target lesions can never convert to measurable lesions, not even if they increase in size at subsequent timepoints and become measurable. Only true new lesions  can be measured and contribute to the TMTB.
6.  Example: A patient has multiple lung metastases, all smaller than 10 mm and selected as non-target lesions at baseline.  If, at a subsequent timepoint some of these non-target lesions increase and become > 10 mm, and one new lesion >10 mm appears, only the new measurable lesion will contribute to  the TMTB, and not the baseline selected non-target lesion  that increased in size. Otherwise such an increase would  make persisting non-target lesions switch into the new measurable lesion category which would be inaccurate,  as the lesion existed at baseline.
7.  irPD Based on Non-Target Lesions: Unlike irRC that neglect non-target lesions for the assessment of irPD, in irRECIST a substantial and unequivocal increase of non-target lesions is indicative of progression. 
8.  irPD Based on New Non-Measurable Lesions: According to irRC, a patient with multiple new lesions of [ADDRESS_1225335] one new lesion of 10 mm may be assessed as irPD if the TMTB of such a patient increases ≥ 20% compared to nadir. According to irRECIST, the reviewer may assign irPD for the patient with multiple new lesions of 9 mm if they are considered to be a sign of unequivocal, massive worsening (see 2.3)
9.  irPD Confirmation: Progression confirmation no less than  [ADDRESS_1225336] irPD assessment is within the compound-specific  tumor flare window.

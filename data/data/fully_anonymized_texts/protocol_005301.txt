Study Protocol  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
October  26, 2017  
RESEARCH STRATEGY  
A. Significance  
A1. Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most prevalent eating disorder and is associated with 
substantial psychiatric and medical comorbidity.  BED affects more than six million Americans, with 
lifetime prevalence at 3% for women and 2% for men.1 BED is characterized by [CONTACT_173474][INVESTIGATOR_173433] (i.e., binge eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) without the use of compensatory 
behaviors (e.g., purging, excessive exercise ).2 Although obesity is not part of the diagnostic criteria for BED, 
more than 65% of individuals with BED are obese3, 4, and more than a quarter of patien ts seeking treatment for 
obesity have BED .5 Obese individuals with BED, versus those without, experience more severe obesity, greater 
eating disorder psychopathology (e.g., greater  weight and shape concerns, higher body dissatisfaction), and 
lower self -esteem .5-7 Obese individuals with BED are significantly more likely to suffer from health conditions 
such as dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_173434]4, in addition to being 
at increased risk for health problems associated with obesity generally .8, 9 Health complications due to obesity 
comprise  a high proportion of the nation’s health care budget8,  and the healthcare costs of individuals with 
BED are $18,152 higher than in obese  peers without BED .1 The prevalence of BED and the substan tial burden 
of healthcare costs  highlight the need for treatments that eliminate binge eating and produce weight loss.    
A2.  Obese patients with BED desire and would benefit from interventions that can improve 
binge eating and weight. Patients with BED frequently present to treatment seeking to both reduce binge 
eating and lose weight10, 11 and there is growing consensus among practitioners that there is harm in failing to 
address obesity co -morbid with eating pathology.12, 13 Although patients and practitioners recognize the value in 
treating both binge eating and obesity, there remains a lack of effective specialized interventions for obese 
individuals with BED. 14 Understanding why existing treatments for BED fail to adequately improve both binge 
eating and weight can inform  the development of more effective treatme nts for obese patients w ith BED.  
A3. Shared mechanisms contribute to  binge eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_173435].  Individuals with BED show elevated risk for two types of eating behaviors 
that lead to weight gain: binge eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_173436]. While calories 
consumed from binge eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_173437] a large role in the weight control difficulties observed in BED, 
individuals with BED also consume more calories than obese peers without BED outside of binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] .[ADDRESS_202803] a tendency for many internal factors (e.g., emotional states, 
cravings) and external factors (e.g., presence of palatable food) to trigger overeating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  (with or without 
the loss of control that is the signature [CONTACT_173503])  in patients with BED. Patients with  BED 
appear to be particularly  vulnerable to frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_173438]  (i.e., the tendency, in those 
attempting t o regulate their dietary intake, to overeat in response to internal and external cues ).[ADDRESS_202804] sensitivity  (i.e., a hyper -
responsiveness of reward circuitry to food cues or intake ).15. Patients with BED demonstrate increased food 
reward sensitivity compared to obese peers without BED and have greater difficulty inhibiting intake of 
palatable foods .15, [ADDRESS_202805] sensitivity because of 
an overvaluation of weight and shape  (e.g., a clinically elevated degree to which body weight or shape 
influences an individual’s self -evaluation) and subsequent fears of weight gain .28, 29  This fear of weight gain can 
encourage repeated attempts to control dietary 
intake. While efforts to restrain intake are not 
universally detrimental for patients with BED (as 
reviewed in greater detail below), rigid dietary 
restra int (e.g. strict adherence to dietary rules, 
avoidance of specific food groups) can increase 
vulnerability to both binge eating and overeating 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].[ADDRESS_202806] and distress intolerance  (i.e., 
the perceived inability to tolerate negative emotional states) .38-[ADDRESS_202807] to regulate emotions45, 49 and reduce  
access to more adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262] .45, 50 Ultimately, eating becomes one of very few “tools in the tool -kit” 
for reducing distress .[ADDRESS_202808] and distress intolerance directly and indirectly (e.g., by [CONTACT_173475]) contribute to binge eating, overeating epi [INVESTIGATOR_173439], and an elevated BMI in 
patients with BED. These widely accepted maintenance factors for BED reflect areas where treatments can 
interv ene to reduce overeating epi[INVESTIGATOR_173440] . However , existing behavioral 
treatments for BED  fail to adequately address these shared maintenance factors.   
A4. Cognitive behavioral therapy effectively reduces binge eating , but fails to improve weight. 
The current gold -standard treatment for reducing binge eating  in BED is  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT )51, 
which uses cognitive and behavioral techniques to regularize eating, reduce dietary restraint, and alter the 
cognitive manifestations of BED .29 CBT for BED is superior to other treatment s in eliminating binge eating, 
with up to 60% of patients achieving full remission from binge eating .[ADDRESS_202809] that weight reduction is not an explicit goal . Weight loss in CBT, however, is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_173441] -existent51-53 as calories previously consumed during binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_173442] -binge meals.56, 57  The inability of CBT to reduce weight is likely due  to CBT’s emphasis on  
broadly reducing dietary restraint  and a lack of attention to  overeating epi[INVESTIGATOR_173439].[ADDRESS_202810] sensitivity by [CONTACT_173476] “binge trigger” foods early in treatment and schedule alternative activities in between planned 
eating times to reduce urges to binge .[ADDRESS_202811] and 
mood intolerance can maintain eating pathology, and mood intolerance is targeted b y a more complex version 
of CBT, Enhanced CBT (CBT -E).[ADDRESS_202812] and distress intolerance .59, 60 CBT targets 
overvaluation of shape and weight by [CONTACT_173477] “expressions,” which are defined as behaviors that result 
from and maintain overvaluation of shape and weight .17, [ADDRESS_202813] weight loss. Behavioral weight loss  (BWL; which uses behavioral 
techniques to reduce caloric intake and increase physical activity63) is the most effective behavioral treatment 
at producing weight loss in BED .[ADDRESS_202814] not demonstrated this relation, particularly when using samples of self -assessed binge eaters or 
sub-threshold BED cases .65, 66  These mixed findings may be related to methodological shortcomings (e.g., 
reliance on self -report questionnaires, inclusion of heterogeneous patients with sub -threshold levels of BED), 
and a lack of long -term follow -up data .51, 64, [ADDRESS_202815] of BED on weight loss in BWL , with obese BED samples losing significantly less 
weight (M=6.95kg ) compared to obese peers without BED (M= 13.51 ). The long -term outcomes for BWL 
treatments in BED are especially poor, as patients with BED tend to re -gain lost weight more quickly than 
obese peers without BED67-[ADDRESS_202816] diets  often improve 
binge eating in the short term (even among patients who are in the normative weight range73, 74) long -term 
adherence over time is 1) difficult to maintain and 2) could  promote the reoccurrence of binge eating if dietary 
restraint is rigidly applied.  A recent systematic review assessing the impact of very low calorie diets on binge 
eating65 found that most interventions reduced binge eating during active treatment75-83, but a re -occurrence in 
binge eating after treatment occurred in many (but  not all) studies .76, 77, 79, [ADDRESS_202817] two weeks of 
treatment than obese peers without a binge  eating history  (B=.39, SE = .19, Wald χ2 =4.39, p = .04).  This 
result adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that patients with BED are espec ially vulnerable to lapses 
from treatment prescriptions in BWL and may benefit from novel treatment strategies to increase adherence.  
BWL fails to adequately address elevated food reward sensitivity, negative affect, distress intolerance, 
and overvaluation of weight and shape . Most BWL programs encourage participants to use stimulus control 
techniques (e.g., strategies designed to reduce exposure to food cues) to limit access to high -calorie  foods .71, 72, [ADDRESS_202818] reported that reaching their desired BMI would require a 36% reduction in weight, an 
expectation that far exceeds weight losses in BWL .102 Even the BMI reduction patients with BED report as 
“disappointing” were 1.[ADDRESS_202819] 
attempted to improve weight loss outcomes for BED by [CONTACT_173478] a sequential 
treatment design (e.g., CBT followed by [CONTACT_173479]) .64, 82, 105, [ADDRESS_202820]. Grilo assessed whether sequential CBT and BWL treatment could produce 
greater weight loss than BWL alone and found no support for the sequential ordering of treatment .64 These 
results support the notion that the current iterations of both CBT and BWL (either alone or in conjunction) are 
unlikely to produce clinically meaningful weight outcomes for patients with BED.  
A7. Tailored dietary and physical activity recommendations for patients with BED may improve 
weight loss outcomes.  One of the key challenges for improving treatment outcomes in BED is the need to 
achieve a calorie deficit sufficient to produce meaningful weight loss without substantially increasing hunger, 
cravings, and perceived deprivation, all of which could increas e urges to binge or overeat. Compared to obese 
peers without BED, individuals with BED are more likely to report hunger and cravings when di eting, and 
demonstrate greater food intake in response to hunger and cravings in laboratory tests.41, 107 -109  Similarly, 
patients with BED experience greater hedonic hunger (i.e., hunger that occurs in the absence of an energy 
deficit and is largely driven  by [CONTACT_173480]) than obese peers without BED110, [ADDRESS_202821] of anxiety sensitivity 
(e.g., fear of anxiety and related sensations, conceptually related to distress intolerance) on binge eati ng 
pathology, perhaps because physical activity functions as a copi[INVESTIGATOR_173443] a way to reduce emotional distress .116 A recent systematic review of physical activity for BED  concludes that 
adding exercise to behavioral treatments for BED can facilitate reduced binge eating and weight loss both 
directly (e.g., by [CONTACT_173481]) and indirectly (e.g., by [CONTACT_173482], reducing reliance on binge 
eating to reduce emotion al distress).117 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_173444], existing 
treatments either do not include any physical activity (CBT) or target physical activity as only a secondary goal 
of treatment given evidence that reducing caloric intake is more important for producing initial weight loss 
(BWL) .72, [ADDRESS_202822] sensitivity . Acceptance -Based Behavioral Treatment s 
(ABBT s, a group of novel “third -generation” behavior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_173445]119 and 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)120) teach patients a set of psychological strategies that we believe 
can reduce binge e ating and overeating without loss of control in patients with BED. The goal of ABBT  is not to 
reduce the frequency of aversive experiences  (e.g., hunger, cravings, fatigue ); rather, the aim is to foster 
willingness to experience aversive internal experiences while simultaneously engaging in  behavior s consistent 
with long -term  goals and values (e.g., choosing to exercise even while feeling fatigued, adhering to a meal plan 
while having urge s to eat more palatable foods) . Patients are taught a number of psychological strategies 
(reviewed in detail in the ABBT Condition  section below) designed to disrupt key maintenance factors in BED 
(e.g. experiential acceptance as an alternative to distress intolerance, values clarification to identify alternative 
valued life domains and reduce overvaluation of weight and shape) . The conceptual  fit between ABBTs and 
binge eating is well noted in existing literature and has led to the development of a number of acceptance -based 
treatment approaches  designed to reduce binge eating including but not limited to Mindfulness -based Eating 
Awareness  Training121, [ADDRESS_202823] .128, 129  Recent 
systematic reviews and meta -analyses indicate  that ABBTs  can produce  medium to large reduction s in binge 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]123, 130 and support the promise of these interventions for reducing binge eating behavior in BED . 
While this early work is promising, no ABBT developed to date has focused on using acceptance -based 
strategies to increase adherence to BWL prescriptions in BED. A small number of the ABBT for BED trials 
described above examined weight loss as a secondary outcome (n=7), but results were typi[INVESTIGATOR_173446], likely 
because adherence to a prescribed weight loss diet was not a key goal of treatment.125, 127, 131 -135 We believe that 
ABBTs focus on learning to  tolerate  uncomfortable internal states in the service of goal -directed behavior s is 
uniquely well -suited to improving adherence to BWL prescriptions. Recent work by [CONTACT_29452] (reviewed 
in detail below) provides early support for the ability of ABBT to increase adherence to BWL prescriptions in 
obese individuals without BED.136, [ADDRESS_202824] shown promise at reducing binge eating symptoms in 
BED and facilitating weight loss in obese adults without BED, an ABBT designed to directly target both  binge 
eating and weight loss in p atients with BED has yet to be evaluted.  
A7. Current s tudy. We propose to (a)  compare the efficacy of an ABBT  that targets both binge eating and 
weight loss in patients with BED to a Standard Behavioral Weight Loss Treatment (SBT), (b) evaluate the 
extent to which  ABBT and SBT target shared maintenance factors for binge eating and overeating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] , and 
(c) assess whether treatment efficacy is moderated by [CONTACT_173483].   
B. Innovation  
B1. Our study will be the first to evaluate an ABBT for BED designed to 1) address maintenance 
factors that give rise to both  binge eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_173447] 2) increase adherence to BWL prescriptions. Existing ABBTs for BED have focused 
almost exclusively on reducing binge eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  Our team conducted a review of treatment protocols of 
ABBTs for BED and found that session content dedicated to the use of acceptance -based strategies to augment 
adherence to BW L prescriptions or reduce overeating epi[INVESTIGATOR_173448] -
existent in treatments that have been evaluated to date. For example, in a recent trial of Mindfulness -Based 
Eating Awareness Training131, weight loss was evaluated as a secondary outcome and recommended calorie 
goals were provided. However, the authors state that “ calorie  levels specifically encouraged participants not to 
target  weight loss, but rather to maintain current weight while  addressing eating difficulties” and weight 
management was only briefly mentioned in two out of twelve sessions. Unsurprisingly, only 28% experienced 
>[ADDRESS_202825] indicated that patients with 
features often elevated in BED (e.g. high disinhibition, elevated food reward sensitivity, food -specific 
impulsivity; see Preliminary S tudies  section below for more details) experience the most added benefit from 
ABBT. However, all of these trials have excluded patients with full -threshold BED .  Our study will be the first to 
test an ABBT with an explicit focus on 1) altering shared mechanisms that give rise to both binge eating and 
overeating without loss of control and 2) increasing adherence to BWL prescriptions in patients with BED.   
B2. Very few studies to date have altered standard behavioral  treatment prescriptions to 
address the unique needs of patients with BED. Our treatment will modify standard behavioral 
treatment recommendations  to achieve a calorie deficit while minimizing hunger, cravings, and perceived 
deprivation that could increase urges to binge or overeat . These methods  (described in greater detail in the 
ABBT Condition  section)  include providing guidance on the  types of foods patients can eat to enhance satiety, 
eliminating rigid dietary rules (e.g., avoiding specific food groups, not eating after set times), incorporating 
portion -controlled, palatable foods (e.g., desserts, salty snack foods) to avoid feeling s of deprivation, and 
promoting high levels of moderate -to-vigorous physical activity as a primary method for altering the calorie 
balance. While other studies have  attempted to modify BWL for patients with BED, existing work has focused 
largely on the incorporation of CBT strategies into BWL treatments .64, 82, 105, [ADDRESS_202826] whether ABBT works through the 
hypothesized pathways and alters shared maintenance factors for binge eating and overeating in patients with 
BED . A primary goal is to assess whether patients who receive ABBT demonstrate (a) larger increases in 
flexible (but not rigid) dietary restraint , (b) greater adherence to caloric and physical activity goals , (c) larger 
improvements in negative affect and distress intolerance, and (d) greater reductions in overvaluation of weight 
and shape compared to patients in SBT, and whether changes in these targets are associated with outcomes.  
B4. Few studies of BED have assessed baseline moderators of weight loss . Although a growing 
number of studies have assessed baseline predictors of treatment outcome  for binge eating , data on predictors 
of weight loss in BED is limited.[ADDRESS_202827] all been proposed as markers 
of a more severe su bset of BED patients who may not respond as well to current interventions .146-148 Assessing 
baseline moderators of treatment outcome will provide meaningful data to personalize treatment selection.  
C. Approach  
C1. Preliminary s tudies. Promising results from several of our team’s studies demonstrate that 1) this team 
has the expertise and resources necessary to conduct the proposed research (e.g., recruit and retain BED 
participants, deliver SBT and ABBT), and 2) the hypotheses to be tested in this study are likely to be supported.    
CARE Project I.  Drs. Juarascio and Forman recently completed an open -trial 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_173449] .128 Weight loss was not an aim of this ABBT and  
the trial included patients who were normal weight in addition to patients who 
were overweight or obese. Participants (n=19) reported high acceptability of the 
treatment and retention rates were high at 89.4%. Generalized linear multilevel 
modeling reveal ed large and significant improvements in global eating 
pathology and binge frequency. I ncreases  in distre ss tolerance predicted 
decreases in binge eating  across several measures (rs = .35 -.54).  
CARE Project II.  [CONTACT_173504] recently completed a ten -session ABBT weight loss program with a small 
number of overweight and obese BED patients (n=5) who previously completed CARE Project I. Patients 
reported high acceptability of the program and lost 2.7% body weight by [CONTACT_5875] 10. Although results are 
preliminary, past research has demonstrated that early weight loss predicts subsequent success in BWL .149-[ADDRESS_202828].  Drs. Juarascio and Forman previously assessed ABBT in a sub -sample of obese patients  (n= 
20, Mean BMI: 39.44 ) with eating pathology in a larger treatment study .152 The full study examined whether 
the addition of ABB T groups to treatment as usual in a residential treatment facility for eating disorders would 
improve treatment outcomes .153 Results revealed that obese patients in the ABBT condition trended towards 
larger reductio ns in shape/weight concern and global eating pathology by [CONTACT_173484], with effect sizes in the 
moderate range (partial eta squared of .29 to .38). Patients in the ABBT condition also lost more weight (ABBT: 
2.31 kg, TAU: 1.30 kg) , despi[INVESTIGATOR_173450] t explicitly a goal of this version of ABBT.  
Mind Your Health I.  A previous NIH -funded project ([CONTACT_173505], PI) assigned participants (n=128) to 30 
sessions of ABBT or SBT for weight loss .154 Attendance at ABBT groups was excellent (M = 81.7% of 30 
sessions) and higher than in SBT (M=73.9%) indicating that the acceptability of ABBT is high. When 
administered by [CONTACT_173485], percent weight loss was significantly  higher in 
ABBT than SBT at post -treatment (13.2% vs. 7.5%; p = .01) and 6 -month follow -up (11.0% vs. 4.8%; p = .01). 
Although BED patients were excluded, higher levels of depression, disinhibition and responsivity to food 
(characteristics typi[INVESTIGATOR_173451]) moderated the main effect of treatment. For example, among 
individuals with depression at baseline, 40 -week weight losses were 18.2% for ABBT and 5.5% for SBT.  
Mind Your Health II.  A nearly completed NIH -funded project ([CONTACT_173505], PI) assessed the long -term efficacy 
of ABBT versus SBT for overweight and obese adults. Participants (n=190) were randomly assigned to [ADDRESS_202829] -treatment, ABBT yielded statistic ally and clinically significant greater percent 
weight loss (M= 13.3%) compared to SBT (M= 9.8 %) and the superiority of ABBT was maintained at one -year 
follow -up.[ADDRESS_202830] -treatment retention rates (82.6% at 12 months) exceeded our target. Similar to Mind Your 
Health I, patients with BED were excluded from the study; however, patients with high food -specific 
impulsivity (which is elevated in BED155) performed better in ABBT .[ADDRESS_202831] from our team ([CONTACT_173505], Co -I) randomized 283 overweight 
and obese participants to receive 26 sessions of group -based SBT (with or without a focus on changing the 
home environment) or ABBT. As in the previous trials, patients with full -threshold BED were excluded from [ADDRESS_202832]-Tx 3m F/UBinge Frequency
treatment. However,  patients with sub -clinical binge eating (defined as no more than three binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_173452])  were included  and preliminary results indicate greater weight loss in the 
ABBT condition (M=11.58%) than the SBT (M=9.71%) conditions  for this subgroup.  
C2. Study d esign. Participants will be randomly assigned to SBT or ABBT. Treatment will be delivered in 75 -
minute, small ( 12-15 participants), closed -group sessions . Groups  will be held weekly in months 1 -3, biweekly 
in months 4 -6, and monthly i n months 7 -12, for a total of 25  sessions. Assessments will occur at  months 0 
(baseline), 1 (midpoint 1), 3 (midpoint 2) 6 (midpoint 3 ), 12 (post -treatment), and 24 (1 -year follow -up).  
C3. Alternative designs considered. While we considered a shorter treatment duration (to reduce burden 
and increase disseminability), we ultimately chose a [ADDRESS_202833] recommended that, for initial tests of efficacy, tre atments should be evaluated at full 
potency to reduce the likelihood that failure occurs because of sub -optimal dosage.158 If ABBT improves weight 
loss outcomes for BED, methods for reducing the intensity (e.g. optimization and refinement of session 
content) and increasing the scalability (e.g. use of alternative delivery methods and/or non -experts clinicians, 
both of which h ave been successfully completed with ABBTs for other disorders159) can be explored in future 
studies. We also considered including a second follow -up assessment , but determined that given the time 
needed to recruit and treat 1 30 participants with BED, a lo nger follow -up period would not be feasible.

 C4. Participants. 130 participants will be recruited who meet the following inclusion criteria: DSM -5 
diagnosis of BED, BMI 27 -45 kg/m2; age 18 -70 years; and ability to engage in PA (i.e., can walk [ADDRESS_202835]) . Exclusion criteria are as follows: medical condition (e.g., acute coronary syndrome, type I 
diabetes) or psychiatric condition (e.g., active substance abuse, severe depression) that may pose a risk to the 
participant during intervention, cause a change in weight, or limit ability to comply with the recommendat ions 
of the program; pregnant or planning to become pregnant in the next 2 years; planned move out of the 
Philadelphia area in the next 2 years; recently began a course of or changed the dosage of medication that can 
cause significant change in weight; his tory of bariatric surgery; and weight loss of > 5% in the past [ADDRESS_202836] established a variety of referral sources (including college counseling 
centers, private practitioners, and medical practices) for their ongoing grants recruiting patients with BED, 
bulimia nervosa, and obesity . We will also advertise in newspapers and radio stations. We will specially design 
advertisements (e.g., featuring images of men/ethnic minorities) and select media (e.g. , that have high 
male/ethnic minority readership/listenership) to maximize participation of men and ethnic minorities. In Dr . 
Grilo’s most recent RCT ( DK49587), similar recruitment methods yielded N=191 randomized BED patients 
(which exceeded target of N=175) and yielded 35% men and 24% minority enrollment. We considered making 
special effort to recruit participants high in proposed moderators to ensure adequate power for Secondary Aim 
2, but based on available literature112, 127, 160, [ADDRESS_202837] monthly videoconference meetings to discuss any concerns related to recruitment, enrollment, or 
retention and will meet in -person during twice yearly during national conferences to review study progress.   
Participants will be screened by [CONTACT_173486].  Phone screens will use questions 
from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)163 to assess psychiatric comorbidity and will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_173487], similar to procedures used successfully in our other NIH -funded 
trials.  Those who appear eligible will attend an orientation session where they will receive detailed information 
about the study. At a subsequent clinic visit, eligibility will be verifie d, informed consent obtained, and the 
baseline assessment completed. The enrollment process will provide participants with an adequate opportunity 
to determine whether the assessment burden and demands of the program are acceptable; this is expected to 
reduce attrition. After the baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to condition in blocks of 6, 
stratifying by [CONTACT_150146] (<30, 30 -40, and >40), sex, race/ethnicity, and frequency of binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] . 
C6. Therapy c onditions. We decided to use  SBT as our control condition given that weight loss is our 
primary outcome. We considered including CBT as an alternative control condition, but ultimately decided that 
CBT would be a sub -par control because this treatment does not directly encourage weig ht loss and 
consistently produces minimal to no weight loss for patients with BED.  
C6a. Standard Behavior Therapy (SBT) c ondition.  SBT will be adapted from state -of-the art SBT 
manuals our team  has used for previous weight loss studies, which were themselves adapted from Look 
AHEAD and the Diabetes Prevention Program protocols .71, 72 Components of SBT include nutrition and 
physical activity education, self -monitoring of calorie intake, physical activity, and weight; stimulus control 
techniques; identifying triggers for overeating; setting individualized realistic goals for calorie inta ke, physical 
activity, and associated behaviors; using problem solving skills as a way of overcoming obstacles to  behavior 
change; developi[INVESTIGATOR_173453]; and relapse prevention techniques. Pa tients  will be given calorie goals based 
on weight, in accordance with standard balanced deficit diet guidelines164 (e.g., pa tients  weighing 250 -299 lbs. 
will b e prescribed 1500 kcal/day). Patients  will be instructed to gradually increase their physical activity until 
they reach at least [ADDRESS_202838] associated with successful weight loss maintenance .166-168  
 C6b. Acceptance -Based Behavioral Treatment (ABBT) Condition.  The ABBT manuals will be based 
on the manuals developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Juarascio for the CARE I and CARE II Projects and  the manuals developed by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Forman for MYH1 and MYH2. ABBT is a behavioral treatment approach, and as such, uses some of the 
same behavioral techniques used in CBT and SBT, particularly during Phase 1. As described in greater detail 
below, many of the standard behavioral techniques and recommendations were mo dified to better suit the 
unique needs of patients with BED or facilitate weight loss.  Because acceptance -based techniques are designed 
to work in conjunction with behavioral treatment recommendations, we first introduce patients to modified 
behavioral st rategies drawn from CBT and SBT during Phase 1 and subsequently introduce acceptance -based 
techniques to improve adherence and address key maintenance factors for BED during Phase 2.  
 Phase 1 (Sessions 1 -8): The first eight  sessions of ABBT will use behavioral strategies from both CBT and 
SBT to 1) reduce binge eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_49591] 2) alter the calorie balance.  
CBT t echniques.  We chose to focus on reducing  binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_173454] [ADDRESS_202839] in meeting their calorie goals (e.g., self -monitoring of calorie intake; stimulus 
control techniques; problem solving skills) .  While many techniques will be similar to SBT, some modifications 
will be made to address the unique needs of patients with BED.  For example, p atients will receive education 
about the ways rigid dietary restraint  can trigger binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (e.g., severe caloric restriction, he donic 
restriction, avoiding specific food groups, going long periods of time without eating), and will learn how to 
reduce caloric intake in ways that will minimize  hunger and cravings. The table to the right  provides examples 
of these strategies.  One core difference will be that patients in ABBT will be encouraged to incorporate portion 
controlled palatable foods regularly to avoid feelings of deprivation that could trigger binge eating. While 
avoiding highly palatable foods can be a successful st rategy f or many obese patients, hedonic deprivation may 
be less sustainable for patients with BED and could encourage future binge eating or overeating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].   
The exercise progression in ABBT will  be the same as in SBT, with specific session content dedicated to 
psychoeducation about the benefits of physica l activity for BED in Session 8. The ABBT treatment will also 
provide psychoeducation relevant to patients with BED (e.g., session content on avoiding compensatory and 
compulsive exercise).  We chose to begin the exercise progression in Phase 1 because 1) this will allow patients 
who are currently sedentary time to safely build up to the recommended exercise progression, and 2) research 
indicates that exercise can indirectly reduce binge eatin g epi[INVESTIGATOR_173455], self -efficacy, and 
body image as well as reducing the degree to which binge eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_173456] .117 We 
considered u sing a more intensive exercise progression for ABBT, but decided that given the low long -term 
adherence rates observed in SBT90-94, ,the feasibility of meeting even higher activity goals would be limited.  
Phase 2 (sessions 9 -19): Phase 2 will focus on the use of acceptance -based strategies to improve adherence 
to dietary and physical activity goals and address shared maintenance factors for binge eating and overeating 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] . Below we will review how acceptance -based techniques will be incorporated in Phase 2.   
Values clarity/commitment enhancement.  Consistent with principles of ACT120 and intrinsic motivation 
theory179, ABBT will emphasize that participants must choose goals that emanate from freely -chosen, personal 
life values (e.g., living a long and healthy life; being a present, active mother). A structured process for the 
identification of such life values will be f ollowed and the connections between these values and eating and 
physical activity behaviors will be emphasized. Participants will be taught that commitment to difficult 
behavioral goals is only likely to be maintained when one connects psychologically with  life values important 
enough and meaningful enough to make such effort and sacrifice worthwhile. Commitment will be presented as 
a critical component of maintaining changes to the personal food and physical activity environment. Values 
clarity interventio ns will also be used to alter overvaluation of weight and shape. An underlying assumption 
about values is that they are finite; that is, there is a limit to what can be encapsulated in an individual’s value 
base. Thus, the overvaluation of weight and shape  that occurs in BED necessitates that there is less “room” for 
other valued domains .128 By [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_173457], ABBT may be 
able to foster awareness of the values -inconsistent nature of binge eating and overeating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], reduce 
overvaluation of weight and shape, and improve motivation for adhe rence to program goals.  
Distress tolerance.  ABBT will help participants recognize that, 1) eating -related distress (e.g. urges to 
binge, hunger, cravings ) is bound to occur in today’s obesogenic environment, particularly given the elevated 
food reward sensitivity common in BED and 2) attempts to avoid these internal experiences are often 
ineffectual or even counterproductive. Participants will learn to tol erate aversive states related to eating (e.g., 
cravings) and physical activity (e.g., boredom, discomfort) while continuing to engage in the desired behaviors  
through in -session experiential activities and at -home practice . For example, in one session , participants will 
hold themselves in the “plank” ( an unsupported sitting) position and practice tolerating the bodily discomfort 
that is generated by [CONTACT_173488] . Willingness  (simultaneously engaging in a valued action while accepting the 
discomfort it generates) will be framed as more adaptive than distress intolerance (i.e., eating foods or 
ceasing/avoiding activity to avoid bein g uncomfortable). Experiential exercises will allow participants to 
practice distancing themselves from thoughts and feelings in a way that enhances willingness to experience 
them, thereby [CONTACT_173489] (e.g.,  ending a walk early, eating a chocolate bar) to alter the 
experience. Unlike SBT, ABBT assumes that attempts to distract from or modify thoughts and feelings are 
rarely  productive; rather, long -term adherence to health behaviors depends on the ability to tolerate 
unpleasant internal experiences. Distress tolerance will also be used to address elevated negative affect that 
contributes to binge eating and overeating epi[INVESTIGATOR_156198]. Reductions in binge eating have been mediated by [CONTACT_173490], supporting its importance as a treatment target in BED .[ADDRESS_202840] from or numb out uncomfortable experiences.  
Phase 3 (sessions 20 -25):  The final phase will have a strong focus on achieving weight loss maintenance by 
[CONTACT_173491] -term adherence to dietary and physical activity recommendations. Acceptance -based strategies 
such as values clarity and committed action will be used to address reductions in motivation. Patients will also 
be taught how to address a reoccurrence of b inge eating if this behavior emerges at any point during their 
weight loss efforts (e.g., re -establish self -monitoring, reduce dietary restr iction, reincorporate regular eating).  
C7. Intervention cultural sensitivity.  The research team will recruit participants from the Philadelphia 
metropolitan area, which is 38% non -white based on the most recent census data.181 All interventions will be 
culturally sensitive by, for example, discussing barriers to behavior change unique to each participant’s social 
context (e.g., neighborhood safety as a barrier to exercise), and emphasizing health benefits and general 
wellbeing as the motivation for weight loss and exercise .182-[ADDRESS_202841] 
demonstrated that contamination across conditions is extremely low based on codings of audio -recorded 
sessions (MYH II: 0.12/10, ENACT: 0.23/10; 0= perfectly avoided contamination and 10= substantial 
contaminatio n occurred). All treatment sessions will be audio -recorded, and 25% will be rate d for competence 
and fidelity. Feedback on competence and fidelity will be shared after each rated session and shortcomings will 
be addressed immediately. An intervention allegiance survey also will be administered to all clinicians.    
C9. Assessments and Measures.   Assessments will occur at the start of treatment (baseline), 1 month 
(midpoint 1), 3 months (midpoint 2), 6 months (midpoint 3), 12 months (post -treatment), and 24 months (1 -
year follow up). All o utcome and process measures  described below  will be completed at each assessment . 
Acceptability will be assessed at post -treatment.  All assessments will be completed onsite in Drexel 
University’s Department of Psychology. Efforts will be made to schedule midpoint assessments directly after or 
directly before a treatment session to reduce participant travel burden (e.g. month 3 assessme nt will occur 
between sessions 12 and 13, with effort made to schedule participants right after session 12 or right before 
session 13 if possible).  All assessments will be conducted by [CONTACT_173492]  (graduate students who will be highly 
trained and closely supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Manasse).  Blind raters will receive training on standard procedures for 
collecting anthropometric data and administering all process measures described below. Raters will be 
required to pass a “mock” assessment with [CONTACT_173506] and reach 100% agreement on eating disorder 
diagnosis and acceptable reliability (>.80) on EDE scoring  before they will be cleared to conduct assessments .  
 Feasibility and Acceptability.  Assessment of feasibility will include number of patients screened per 
month, % of eligible patients enrolled, treatment attrition (% of patients that prematurely terminate 
treatment), study retention (% of patients that complete all assessments), treatme nt adherence, and treatment 
fidelity. Acceptability will be assessed using the Feedback Questionnaire  and Credibility/Expectancy 
Questionnaire194 to gauge participant’s attitudes and feelings toward the treatment.  
Outcomes.  The primary outcome measure for the study will be change in weight . Weight will be measured 
in street clothes without shoes using a standardized Secca  scale accurate to 0.1 kg. Eating pathology will be 
a secondary outcome measure and will be measured by [CONTACT_173493] (EDE) , a widely 
utilized, semi -structured interview for eating disorder symptoms .195 Participant’s EDE global scores  and 
objective binge frequency  will be the primary outcome measures for eating disorder pathology.  
Process Measures.  The study will assess whether patients who receive ABBT show greater improvements in 
1) flexible restraint (and less rigid dieting behaviors), 2) adherence to caloric and physical activity goals, 3) 
negative affect, 4) distress tolerance, and 5) overvalua tion of weight and shape compared to patients who 
receive SBT. Measurement tools were selected on the basis of assessing clinical targets using multiple 
assessment approaches. We will assess flexible restraint and disinhibited eating with the Eating 
Inventory (Three Factor Eating Questionnaire)196, a commonly used measure of dietary restraint. Three specific 
subscales within this measure will be of particular focus: Rigid Control of Eating  Behaviors, Flexible Control of 
Eating Behaviors, and Disinhibition .197 Dietary intake  will be measured by 72 hours of recalled intake using 
the Automated Self -administered 24 -hour Dietary Recall (ASA24) , a National Cancer Institute -designed free 
software tool that enables self -administered, but interactive, [ADDRESS_202842] -administered 
24-hour food recall when using doubly -labeled water as the criterion .199   
We will define  physical activity (PA)  in kcal/wk of energy expended through MVPA200 with ActiGraph 
GT3X tri -axial, solid state accelerometers . Accelerometers, particularly models made by [CONTACT_91927], have been 
found to be valid and reliable means of measuring PA .201, [ADDRESS_202843] prior to each assessment point, 
either through mail or at group meetings, an d returned at each assessment visit. For 7 consecutive days at each 
assessment point, participants will wear accelerometers for all waking hours.  
A Negative Mood Induction (NMI) task will be used to assess negative affect  and distress intolerance  
during and after an acute stressor. Following completion of all study measures participants will undergo an 
autobiographical recall task, a commonly used negative mood induction .206-[ADDRESS_202844] Scale (PANAS)209 before and after the mood induction and after a ten -
minute waiting period following the mood induction. Heart rate (a physiological measure of emotional state) 
will be monitored throughout the induction and post -induction period using the Polar E600 heart rate 
monitor. Several prior studies have utilized mood inductions to assess ability to regulate and tolerate negative 
emotions in response to a stressor .210-213 Distress intolerance will also be measured using the Difficulties in 
Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) .214 The DERS assesses awareness and understanding of emotions, ability to 
tolerate emotional arousal, and effective action in the presence of intense emot ions. We will also use two 
behavioral measures of distress intolerance. The computerized Mirror -Tracing Persistence Task215, 216  measures 
the amount of time a participant is willing to engage in a frustrating task (tracing a dot on a computer screen 
that moves in the opposite direction as one moves the computer mouse). The cold pressor test measures the 
length of time a participant is willing to leave her hand in water kept at 3° C through the use of a circulating 
water bath system (Lauda RM6) For safety reasons, participants are not allowed to exceed [ADDRESS_202845] proven valid measures of distress 
tolerance in health behavior areas, particularly smoking cessation .216, 218 -223 Lastly, depressive symptoms will be 
assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory -II, a 2 1-item measure assessing levels of depressive 
symptomology .224 This self -report scale is widely used and has proven reliable across a variety of demographic 
groups and in both clinical and nonclinical populations .  
Overvaluation of shape and weight  will be assessed using the following two questions pulled from 
the Eating Disorder Examination : “Over the past four weeks, has your shape influenced how you feel about 
(judge, think, evaluate) yourself as a person?” and “Over the past 4 weeks has your weight influenced how you 
feel about (judge, think, evaluate) yourself as a person?”. This method of defining and assessing overvaluation 
of weight/shape has been used in several past studies with BED patients.32, [ADDRESS_202846] sensitivity  will be assessed with the 
Power of Food Scale , a self -report questionnaire that has been shown to reliably and validly measure thoughts 
and feelings about highly palatable foods when not physically hungry .27, 228, 229  
C10 . Statistical Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be generated for all variables. Data summaries will be produced for the combined 
sample and separately by [CONTACT_2939]. Continuous variables will be summarized using mean/median as 
measures of location and SD/inter -quartile ran ge as measures of dispersion; normalizing transformations will 
be used if there is evidence of skewness/kurtosis. Categorical variables will be presented as proportions.  
Primary Aim (Efficacy of ABBT) . Analyses will be conducted via linear mixed effects models for 
longitudinal data, which increase power by [CONTACT_173494] (i.e., primarily, percent weight loss and secondarily, percent binge frequ ency reduction) across time. 
Patterned covariance matrices as implemented in SAS/STAT PROC MIXED V9.[ADDRESS_202847] covariance matrix will be assumed common across 
study arms, with an exponential variance function to deal with heteroscedasticity and a continuous -time AR(1) 
correlation matrix to accommodate residual autocorrelation over the unequal –size time intervals betwe en 
follow -ups. Outcomes at all six  time points will be estimated jointly for maximum statistical efficiency in the 
presence of intermittent missingness and loss to follow -up. The model will include random effects for subject 
and time (with higher -order effects if needed to capture nonlinear change), and fixed effects for treatment arm, 
time by [CONTACT_173495], demographic information, and baseline values of weight, dietary intake and 
physical activity. Time -specific covariate -adjusted contrasts will be used to compare outcome between groups.   
Secondary Aim 1 (Between -Subjects Mediation).  We will examine the extent to which variables of interest 
(i.e., dietary restraint, adherence to caloric and physical activity goals, negative affect and distress tolerance, 
overvaluation of shape/weight, and values clarity) will mediate differences in we ight loss and reduction in 
binge eating between treatments. Specifically, we will determine whether temporally -precedent changes in 
each mediator from baseline to [ADDRESS_202848] effects of each hypothesized mediator 
individually .230, 231  This approach expands on Baron and Kenny’s methods by [CONTACT_173496] .232, [ADDRESS_202849] effects will be generated using the bias -corrected (BC) bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_173458] .234 
Secondary Aim 2 (Between -Subjects Moderation) . Reward sensitivity, overvaluation of shape/weight, 
negative affect, and distress tolerance will be added to the model described in Aim 1, and allowed to interact 
with time and treatment arm, to determine whether these variables moderate the effect of trea tment. 
Statistically significant interactions will be interpreted by [CONTACT_173497] .235  
Missing data.  Our likelihood -based estimation methods remain unbiased when missingness is related to 
previously -observed outcomes as well as model covariates .236 If loss to follow -up is related to the missing 
outcome itself (an assumption that by [CONTACT_173498][INVESTIGATOR_3675]), we will use sensitivity 
analyses based on multiple imputation models237 to explore how robust our findings are with respect to a range 
of assumptions regarding missing data. We feel that these approaches are superior to alternative s (such as 
including only subjects with complete data or assigning a pre -specified score to the missing data) because these 
methods typi[INVESTIGATOR_173459]. We 
have experience with each of these approaches for handling non -ignorable non -response, and will analyze the 
data using several of these methods, which incorporate varying assumptions about the missing observations. 
To determine the extent to which the pattern of missing data might influence our findings, two approaches will 
be used. Compliance rates will be calculated for each participant. Participants with markedly low compliance 
rates (e.g., attendance at fewer than 3 assessments) will be considered for exclusion from analyses. Se condly, 
pattern mixture models169, 172, 174, 175 based on a random regression model (RRM)238, [ADDRESS_202850] of missing data patterns on all variables. Subjects will be divided into groups based on their missing 
data pattern followi ng the guidelines provided by [CONTACT_173499] & Gibbons .240 The influence of missing data patterns 
on key variables will then be evaluated using RRM by [CONTACT_173500]. If missing data patterns are found to 
be associated with key variables, this variable will be used as a covariate in subsequent analyses.   
C11. Power Analyses  
Primary Aim (Efficacy of ABBT).  The study’s data will consist of repeated assessments over time within 
randomized individuals within each treatment condition. Therefore, power calculations are dependent on both 
an expected difference between treatment arms as well as the clustering of t he data (repeated observations 
within an individual with up to six  repeated measures per participant within one of the two treatment 
conditions), resulting in a multilevel model structure. Using the method described by [CONTACT_173501]252-[ADDRESS_202851] sizes from trials with elements similar to the 
proposed study, e.g., percent weight loss comparison between ABBT and SBT from the Mind Your Health II 
study (effect size at 12 months d=0.39) and percent weight loss and binge reduction comparison of CBT  vs. SBT 
(d=0.625; 30% difference in binge reduction rates) .[ADDRESS_202852] a clinically 
meaningful difference for both weight and binge eating frequency (3.5% weight loss between groups (d=0.46) 
and a difference in 4 binge eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_173460] 4 -week time period). Baseline covariat es that can account 
for variability in the trial outcomes were taken into consideration in the power analysis . Given these 
assumptions, a  sample size of 104 (52 for each group) is required for 80% power with the significant level of 
0.05 and five assessment points, assuming the ratio of the variability of level -1 coefficient to the variability of 
level -1 residual is one. While allowing for up to 20% attrition, th e proposed sample size of 130 is adequately 
powered to examine a clinically meaningful difference between treatment conditions  for both  percent weight 
loss and frequency of binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. We believe this power estimate to be conservative given: 1) attriti on 
estimates are greater than the team has achieved in simil ar weight control studies; and 2 ) missing values will 
be imputed using multiple imputation to maximize the number of the observations used to estimate models . 
Secondary Aim 1 (Between -Subjects Mediation).  Tests of mediation will utilize bias -corrected 
bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_173461] s the best balance of statistical power and type I error .255-257 Fritz and 
MacKinnon255 documented sample size requirements to guarantee 80% power at a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_202853] sizes for intervention 
with the mediator and for the mediator on outcome controlled for intervention, a sample size of 130 (58 per 
group) is required to achieve 80% power .241, 244, 255  Given a sample size of 1 30 and the pattern of weight loss and 
attrition described above , we will be sufficiently powered to evaluate our hypothesized effects.  
Secondary Aim 2 (Between -Subjects Moderation) . In the linear mixed models used for the primary 
hypotheses, we will add as covariates both the main effects of our proposed moderators and their interactions 
with intervention assignment. Given N= [ADDRESS_202854] 80% power to detect moderation if the standardized coefficient for the treatment 
x moderator interaction is ≥ 0.3 (accounts for at least 8% of the variance) in a model in w hich the total variance 
accounted for is ≥ 20%.

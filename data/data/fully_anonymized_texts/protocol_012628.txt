1Effect of Ketamine on Laboratory-Induced Stress in Healthy Subjects:
A Proof-of-Concept Translational Study
Clinical Trial Protocol
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
Brief Summary of Research:
Stress exposure is one of the greatest risk factors for psychiatric illnesses like major depressive 
disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress resilience is the ability to 
experience stress without developi[INVESTIGATOR_581159]. Enhancing stress resilience in at-risk 
populations could potentially protect against the development of stress-induced psychiatric 
disorders. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], no resilience-enhancing pharmaceuticals have been identified yet. 
Preclinical studies showed that the administration of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
receptor antagonist ketamine one week before an acute stress prevents the developi[INVESTIGATOR_692829]-like behavior in animals. In this project we propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_692830]. Ketamine will be compared to an active 
placebo control condition, the anesthetic midazolam, in a sample of healthy volunteers. The 
specific aims of this project are to test the effect of ketamine administered 1-week prior an acute 
stress [the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)] (1) on the anxious-composed subscale score of the 
Profile of Mood States (POMS) – Bipolar and (2) on the hypothalamic–pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]–adrenal axis 
(HPA axis), adrenaline-noradrenaline axis (ANS axis), and self-reports of anxiety. We expect that 
subjects treated with ketamine, compared to midazolam, will experience reduced symptoms of 
negative affect and anxiety, as quantified by [CONTACT_692851]-composed subscale score 
of the POMS-Bipolar, and a blunted hormonal response to an acute stress.

2of ketamine compared to midazolam administered [ADDRESS_939606] on the other 
subscale scores of the POMS-Bipolar and other self-reports. Secondary Behavioral 
Hypothesis: Ketamine will be associated with a reduced change from pre-TSST to post-TSST 
as measured by [CONTACT_692852]-Bipolar and other self-reports 
compared to midazolam. Primary Biological Aim: To test the effect of ketamine compared to 
midazolam administered [ADDRESS_939607] on the hypothalamic–pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]–adrenal 
axis (HPA axis). Primary Biological Hypothesis 2: Ketamine will be associated with a blunted 
response or faster recovery of the HPA axis as measured with salivary cortisol. Secondary 
Biological Aim: To test the effect of ketamine compared to midazolam administered [ADDRESS_939608] on an attenuated ANS reactivity, as measured by [CONTACT_692853] α-amylase. 
Secondary Biological Hypothesis: Ketamine will be associated with a blunted response or 
faster recovery of ANS reactivity compared to midazolam. Exploratory Aims: Additional 
exploratory analysis will be conducted on blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma samples 
collected prior to and following the TSST on hormones including ghrelin, NPY, testosterone, 
and DHEA comparing the ketamine group to the midazolam group.
2) Background
A well-validated laboratory paradigm to provoke anxiety: the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). 
Social stressors are amongst the most reliable forms of stress in humans and other species 
(Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). The TSST (Kirschbaum et al., 1993) is among the most popular 
acute stress protocols used to experimentally study the stress response in humans. The TSST 
employs a combination of elements (public speaking, mental arithmetic, anticipation, social 
evaluation) that produces moderate stress in a majority of participants and reliable response in the 
self-reports of negative and positive affect (Allen et al., 2014; Henze et al., 2017). Acute elevations 
of the hypothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_80560] (HPA) axis, sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis 
activity, and self-reports of anxiety have been shown. Responses to the TSST appear to be altered 
in cases of stress-related disorders like major depression or anxiety disorders and both 
pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions can moderate the TSST response (Allen et 
al., 2014). This paradigm is reported under the Domain of Negative Valence Systems primarily 
responsible for responses to aversive situations or context, such as fear, anxiety, and loss, within 
the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of Acute Threat (“Fear”) by [CONTACT_4289]/NIMH. Procedures: 
During the TSST, participants after a rest period on entering the laboratory are introduced to a 
role-playing scenario. They have to prepare a speech to convince a panel that they are the perfect 
candidate for a job, which they must present to a panel of assessors, followed by a mental 
arithmetic task (serial subtraction). Following these tasks participants rest and post-measures are 
taken in multiple time-points (Kirschbaum et al., 1993). Please, refer to section f “Procedures 
Involved in the Human Research” for more details.

3Ketamine is prophylactic against stress-induced depression in animal models. Recent preclinical 
work provides evidence that treatment with ketamine administered one week prior to a stress 
blocks the development of depression-like behavior in rodent models (Brachman et al., 2016). 
These findings represent the first demonstration in the field that a pharmacological agent can 
provide long-term prophylactic protection against the induction of stress-induced depression, 
setting the stage for a major paradigm shift in therapeutic discovery for disorders such as major 
depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this study by [CONTACT_692854]. (Brachman et al., 2016), the animals were pre-treated with ketamine or saline one week prior 
to a chronic social defeat (SD) procedure and behavior was assessed [ADDRESS_939609] (FST) and a social interaction test [Dominant interaction (DI)]. Ketamine-treated mice 
showed significantly reduced immobility time and significantly more time exploring a social target 
mouse compared to saline treated mice following SD, consistent with a blockade of the pro-
depressive effects of SD and enhancement of stress resilience. The investigators confirmed the 
prophylactic effects of ketamine in two additional models in which (1) depressive and anxious 
behavior is induced by [CONTACT_692855] (2) depressive and anxious 
behavior is induced by [CONTACT_491], inescapable shocks (learned helplessness [LH]). Several other 
recent preclinical studies provide additional data in line with these findings (Amat et al., 2016; 
McGowan et al., 2017).
Translating ketamine’s pro-resilience effect from model animals to humans. Capi[INVESTIGATOR_692832]’s experience conducting human studies of ketamine in the context of depression and PTSD 
(Murrough et al., 2013; Feder et al., 2014), herein we aim to determine for the first time the stress 
prophylaxis effect of ketamine in humans when administered [ADDRESS_939610] (Kirschbaum et al., 1993). We will use the TSST applied to healthy 
volunteers in order to determine the effects of ketamine prophylaxis on behavioral, physiological, 
and endocrine readouts. Importantly for the current study, the TSST has been used also to 
investigate the effects of pharmacological agents under the conditions of acute stress in healthy 
volunteer (Makatsori et al., 2004; Fries et al., 2006) and, similar to the acute stress method used in 
animal model, the TSST involves a combination of social stressors elements, thus appearing 
particularly suitable to translate the ketamine pro-resilience effect into humans. 
3) Setting of the Human Research
The human research will be conducted at the Depression and Anxiety Center, Icahn School of 
Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Director: [CONTACT_29189]). Part of the Research will also be 
conducted at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and at the Infusion Suite of the Psychiatry 
Department of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

4We will be recruiting from various sources in the community for this research study. They include 
online recruitment sources, community outreach and physician referrals. All staff members 
assisting with this trial are adequately informed about the protocol, the investigational products, 
and their trial-related duties and functions. An anesthesiologist or other appropriately trained 
licensed physician will administer the study drugs to subjects. [CONTACT_29189], Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_32729], will be responsible for all trial related medical decisions, included the drug related 
procedures. Please refer to the Mount Sinai Treatment Protocol for Ketamine Clinical Research 
(ver. Jan 27, 2017) for more details.
5) Study Design
a) Recruitment Methods
Our program implements a robust workflow for identifying and screening candidates for 
clinical research that is conducted in our program. Subjects contact [CONTACT_692856]-referral or referral by [CONTACT_24018]. We employ both direct-to-patient 
advertising through radio, newspaper, internet-based and other media outlets, as well as 
foster strong collaborations with treating physicians within the Mount Sinai Health System 
and across [LOCATION_001] City more broadly. Another resource for referrals will be via media 
advertisement and internet postings on medical and mental health-related websites. An IRB 
approved recruitment flyer will be used for this study and will be placed on bulletin boards 
in the Mount Sinai Medical Center. Subjects may also be accepted as referrals from the 
Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program screening protocol (GCO# 06-0945). 
Advertisements include the link to an online pre-screening survey, which is IRB approved 
under our MAP Screening Protocol (GCO 06-0945: A Screening Protocol for Adult 
Patients with Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Chronic Medical Conditions, and Healthy 
Volunteers; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_29119], MD). The pre-screener is not required for participation. The 
pre-screener is just one of a handful of ways for participants to find our program and 
therefore find this specific trial. It is not a mandatory part of the GCO 17-2440 study and 
not all subjects will complete it. Part of the screening measures (SCID-5, self-reports) may 
be completed under the MAP screening protocol as long as the assessments are completed 
within one month of the participant signing consent for the present protocol.
Participants make contact [CONTACT_692857], email, or our website. Subsequent 
to contact, patients go through a phone screening process prior to scheduling an in-person 
evaluation. Our centralized recruitment and screening process ensures that subjects are 
efficiently matched with appropriate research studies. 
Once a patient expresses interest in the study, a phone screen is scheduled by a study 
coordinator to provide more information to the candidate over the phone and an initial IRB-
approved phone screen is completed to assess broadly for the presence of inclusion and

5exclusion criteria. Potential subjects are advised that if they do not enroll in research, the 
information will be destroyed, and that if they do enroll, the information becomes part of 
their research chart.  An initial phone screening is completed after they give verbal 
authorization. The study coordinator, who is trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_692833] a cursory 
assessment of study eligibility criteria, completes the phone screen. In general, this process 
is referred to as “pre-screening.” If a candidate appears eligible following the completion 
of the pre-screen, the individual is scheduled for an in-person or remote study screen.
The in-person or remote study screen begins with the informed consent process and a 
written informed consent will be obtained. If the study screen is preformed remotely, the 
subject will be sent a copy of the approved consent form, a study doctor will discuss the 
consent form with the potential participant over a tele-communication platform, and the 
signature [CONTACT_692883]. This consent form provides the details of the time requirements, steps in 
the study, potential risks, confidentiality of information, and the rights of patients as 
research subjects. A copy of the consent form will be given to each participant. Individuals 
enrolled in the study will have a full discussion regarding the project, procedures, relative 
benefits and risks, and options other than participating in this project. Following informed 
consent, the candidate completes demographic, medical history and symptom 
questionnaire self-report forms. Subsequently, the candidate will meet with a clinical rater 
trained on the SCID-[ADDRESS_939611] eligibility 
to participate in a different/future study or ability to receive treatment at Mount Sinai or 
from a private referring physician. Additionally, participants in the study will be able to 
withdraw from the study at any point.

The proposed study does not involve vulnerable populations, such as fetuses, neonates, 
pregnant women, children, prisoners, institutionalized individuals, or others who may be 
considered vulnerable populations. Non-English speaking subjects will also not be enrolled 
in this study. Our staff is primary English speaking and is trained to use standardized 
diagnostic and rating tools are in English. Although non-English speaking individuals may be 
consented with appropriate translation services, we would not be able to diagnose and rate 
such individuals using the same standards. All participants are adults who are able to freely 
consent to research. 
c) Number of Subjects
Considering the pi[INVESTIGATOR_692834], the research plan calls for the randomization 
of n=[ADDRESS_939612] of enrollment at similar rates in 
prior studies recruiting from similar populations. Approximately 60 subjects will be screened 
to achieve the target numbers, based on an estimated screen fail rate of 50%. Given an 
estimated attrition rate of 20%, we expect n=24 to comprise the complete sample.

per month during the study to result in the enrollment of n=[ADDRESS_939614] will participate in the study for up to 8 weeks. 
e) Endpoints
The behavioral primary endpoint is a change from pre-TSST time point -25 (Visit 2) to 
post-TSST (Visit 2; time point +0) on the anxious-composed subscale score of the POMS-
Bipolar in the ketamine group (KET) compared to the midazolam group (MID) one week 
after the administration of the study drug. The behavioral secondary endpoints are changes 
from pre-TSST (Visit 2; time point -25) to post-TSST (Visit 2; time point +0) on the other 
subscale scores of the POMS-Bipolar and other self-reports in the ketamine group compared 
to midazolam. Self-report measures include:
Visual Analog Scale – Anxiety (VAS – stressed)
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)
In addition, the effect of treatment at subsequent time points following the TSST on the 
outcomes described above will be explored.
The biological primary endpoint is a change in HPA activity, as measured by [CONTACT_692859]. The biological secondary endpoint is a change in ANS activity, as 
measured by [CONTACT_692853] α-amylase in response to the TSST in subjects who received ketamine 
compared to midazolam one week prior.

8Additional exploratory analysis will be conducted on blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma 
samples collected prior to and following the TSST on hormones including ghrelin, NPY, 
testosterone, and DHEA comparing the ketamine group to the midazolam group.
f) Procedures Involved in the Human Research
This is a phase IIa, parallel arm, double-blind, randomized, proof of concept study. Upon 
completing the screening procedures, volunteers will be treated with ketamine 0.5 mg/kg 
(KET; n=12) or midazolam 0.045 mg/kg (MID; n=12) under randomized, double blind 
conditions one week prior to undergoing the TSST. We hypothesize that ketamine compared 
to midazolam will result in an attenuated stress response. Screening data will be reviewed to 
determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. Study participants will undergo assessments 
on the screening day (V-1) and on four separate times: 1) V0 (Infusion day): on the day of the 
administration of the drug (ketamine or midazolam); 2) V1: 24 hours after the administration 
of drug (ketamine/midazolam); 3) V2 (assessment day/TSST): one week after the 
administration of drug (ketamine/midazolam); 4) V3 (follow-up & study exit): two weeks 
after the administration of drug (ketamine/midazolam) or at the end of V2. Study visits may 
occur within 3 days before or after the scheduled visit, except for V2 (Assessment day), that 
will occur after one week from V0 (Infusion day). Please, refer to Table 1 “Schedule of 
Assessments, Outcome Measures, Labs and Procedures” for more details.
g) Blinding: Due to the objectives of the study, the identity of test and control treatments will 
not be known to investigators, research staff, or patients. The following study procedures will 
be in place to ensure double-blind administration of study treatments.
- Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled by [CONTACT_692860].
- Packaging and labeling of test and control treatments will be identical to 
maintain the blind. 
The study blind will be broken on completion of the clinical study and after the study database 
has been locked. During the study, the blind may be broken only in emergencies when 
knowledge of the patient’s treatment group is necessary for further patient management. 
Investigational Drug Services is responsible for the formulation, packaging, and labeling of 
the ketamine and midazolam. Please see the Mount Sinai Ketamine Protocol for more details 
on dispensation and administration of the study drugs.

Study Visit 0 will occur up to six weeks after Study Visit -1. The protocol for the treatment 
day (Study Visit 0) is as follows. A urine toxicology screen and pregnancy test will be 
performed before the infusion. The urine toxicology must be negative for illicit substances 
and the pregnancy test must be negative in order to proceed with the infusion. 
oBefore their infusion, participants will complete up to [ADDRESS_939615] processing, motivation, agency, and executive 
attentional function.
oRepresentative cognitive tasks are listed below: 
The Incentive Flanker Task (IFT): The incentive flanker task (IFT) is a variant of the monetary 
incentive delay task (MID) in which participants win or lose money based on their performance 
on flanker trials (stern et al., 2011). Cues presented prior to letter stimuli (2-6 s) designate the 
monetary value for each trial: (1) "gain" cues indicate that subjects earn [ADDRESS_939616] 
response; (2) "loss" cues indicate that subjects can avoid a loss of [ADDRESS_939617] response; 
(3) "neutral" cues indicate that no money is at stake. Two-thirds of all cues are followed by [CONTACT_692861] (congruent or incongruent). Immediately after the response, outcome feedback is 
presented for 2 s, followed by a blank inter-trial interval (ITI) for 2–6s before the next trial begins 
with a new cue. One-third of cues are followed by a blank screen for 2s ("catch" trials), which will 
break colinearity between the cue and feedback. Trial types are presented in pseudorandom order 
and equally divided across runs.
The Self-Agency Task (SAT): The self-agency task (15 minutes) is cognitive task programmed 
in PsychoPy. Subjects undergo training on the task in a self-paced manner before starting the task. 
In baseline block 1, subjects click the left and right keyboard buttons quickly to move a visual bar 
up the computer screen to a target position for 6 trials. In baseline block 2 subjects repeat this but 
are informed and see that the computer is interfering with the bar as they move it up. After the 
baseline blocks, reaction times for each target position are computed and used in the main block. 
In the main block, the trial starts with an image of the target bar position and information on 
whether the trial is a win trial (for $0.50) or a loss trial (-$0.50). Subjects then make button presses 
move the bar up to the target position as quickly as possible. Subjects then receive feedback on 
whether they won or lost depending on their reaction times compared to their performance during 
the baseline blocks. On 75% of the trails, the computer ambiguously interferes with the movement 
of the bar. After the feedback, subjects report on a visual analogue scale whether they or the 
computer were more in control of the bar. There are 90 trials, 45 win and 45 loss.

11The Attention Network Task (ANT): The Attention Network Task is a game wherein the 
participant is presented with a series of five arrows in each trial and must work through several 
distractors to indicate the orientation (left or right) of the center arrow. In each trial, the participant 
is first presented with a crosshair and after a random length of time (50-300ms) a cue is presented 
either above, below, or in place of the crosshair. Immediately following the cue, the participant is 
presented with the arrows either above or below the crosshair (which are either in place of the cue, 
or the cue was a distractor) and must indicate whether the center arrow is pointing left or right. 
The flanking arrows can also act distractors by [CONTACT_692862], incongruent or in random 
directions compared to the center arrow. It is theorized that the Attention Network Task gauges 
three distinct faculties of the Attention Network: 1) Alerting -- involving arousal precipi[INVESTIGATOR_692835]. 2) Orienting – is a more selective allocation 
of attention resources to goal-related stimuli in an environment, and 3) Executive control – which 
is characterized by [CONTACT_5852]-level decision making and discernment, error detection, etc. 
Performance in the task is gauged by [CONTACT_692863].
Patients will be assessed by [CONTACT_692864]. Prior to Infusion, an 
indwelling catheter will be placed in the antecubital veins of right or left arm, and pulse, blood 
pressure, pulse-oximetry, and an EKG strip will be placed for continuous monitoring. At Time 0, 
the infusion will begin through an infusion pump and will continue until completion (on average 
after 40 minutes from the beginning of the infusion). Clinical ratings (BPRS, CADSS, see below) 
will be collected before and after the infusion period by [CONTACT_692865]. Psychometric tests on 
anxiety, and positive and negative affect (POMS-Bipolar, PANAS, BAI, VAS-stressed) will also 
be performed before and after the ketamine infusion A study physician with privileges to 
administer ketamine will be present at the infusion throughout the administration of ketamine or

Study Visit [ADDRESS_939618] and stress 
procedures will be carried out in separate rooms (depi[INVESTIGATOR_692836] A and Room B). The 
baseline rest phase takes place in Room A. Upon arrival, a 60-90 min period is required to 
allow hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal axis activity to normalize, as the process of attending 
the laboratory session itself will likely cause an increase in HPA-axis activity in many 
participants. During this time an indwelling catheter for blood collection will be placed by 
[CONTACT_7355]. Samples/measures will be collected immediately pre- and post-stress. 
Following task instructions, participants then complete the stress procedure in Room B. The 
procedure runs as follows: participants are introduced to a role-playing scenario. They have 
to prepare a speech to convince a panel that they are the perfect candidate for a job, which 
they must then present to a panel of assessors, followed by a mental arithmetic task (serial

14The Profile of Mood States – Bipolar Version (POMS - Bi) scale measures moods and 
feelings primarily in clinical rather than nonclinical settings. It can help to determine an 
individual's psychiatric status for therapy, or be used to compare mood profiles associated 
with various personality disorders. It is also a useful instrument in identifying the effects of 
drug treatments (O’Halloran et al., 2004). This instrument will represent the primary outcome 
measure of the study.
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) (First et al., 2006) 
is a semi-structured interview that provides probe questions as well as follow-up questions to 
be asked by [CONTACT_116211]. It includes an overview to obtain information 
about demographics, work, chief complaint, history of present illness, past history, treatment 
history, and current functioning. The main body of SCID (patient edition) includes 9 modules 
that are designed to diagnose 51 mental illnesses in all. 
The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (Overall & Gorham, 1962) is used to assess 
acute behavioral changes during the infusions. Four key BPRS items for the positive (+) 
symptoms of psychosis will be used: conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_23703], and unusual thought content. Three items representing the negative (-) 
symptoms of psychosis will also be used: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and motor 
retardation.
The Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) (Bremner et al., 1998) is 
used to measure dissociative effects during the infusions. The scale includes 19 questions and 
8 observer ratings scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The CADSS measures 
impairment in body perception, environmental perception, time perception, memory 
impairment, and feelings of unreality.
The Visual Analog Scales: These scales are scored in millimeters from the left-hand side of 
a 100-mm line to a perpendicular mark made by [CONTACT_62086] a point corresponding to the 
apparent magnitude of the feeling state. Range: 0 ("not at all") to 100 ("most ever").
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (Beck et al., 1988). This is a 21-question multiple-choice 
self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety in adults. The questions 
used in this measure ask about common symptoms of anxiety (such as numbness and tingling, 
sweating not due to heat, and fear of the worst happening). It is designed for individuals who 
are of [ADDRESS_939620] 
found the Beck Anxiety Inventory to be an accurate measure of anxiety symptoms in children 
and adults.

15The Reproductive Lifecycle and Hormone Questionnaire (RLHQ) (Freeman et al., 2013) 
is a standard brief questionnaire implemented systematically in clinical trials for MDD to 
assess reproductive lifecycle status and the use of exogenous hormones.  This study will use 
Modules 1 and 2 in all women, and add Module 3 (menstrual cycle tracking) in applicable 
women.
The Behavioral Inhibition/Avoidance Scale (BIS/BAS) (Carver & White, 1994) is a 24-
item self-report questionnaire designed to measure two motivational systems: the behavioral 
inhibition system (BIS), which corresponds to motivation to avoid aversive outcomes, and the 
behavioral activation system (BAS), which corresponds to motivation to approach goal-
oriented outcomes. Participants respond to each item using a 4-point Likert scale: 1 (very true 
for me), 2 (somewhat true for me), 3 (somewhat false for me), and 4 (very false for me). The 
scale has four subscales that were derived via factor analysis. One subscale corresponds to the 
BIS. Seven items contribute to this score (e.g., “Criticism or scolding hurts me quite a bit”). 
The remaining three subscales correspond to three components of BAS. BAS Drive measures 
the motivation to follow one’s goals. Four items contribute to this score (e.g., “When I want 
something I usually go all-out to get it”). BAS Reward Responsiveness measures the 
sensitivity to pleasant reinforcers in the environment. Four items contribute to this score (e.g., 
“It would excite me to win a contest”). BAS Fun Seeking measures the motivation to find 
novel rewards spontaneously. Five items contribute to this score (e.g., “I crave excitement 
and new sensations”).
The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) (Connor & Davidson, 2003) is a 25-
item self-report scale, each rated on a 5-point scale (0-4), with higher scores reflecting greater 
resilience.
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen, S et al., 1983). A 10-item self-report scale that 
was developed to measure the degree to which situations in one’s life are appraised as 
stressful.

number to health-protected information. Only trained personnel will have access to samples. 
Participants have the right to withdraw consent at any time by [CONTACT_692868]. At that time, samples that have not already been used for research will be 
promptly withdrawn from storage and destroyed by [CONTACT_21724]. 
Results will be published as group data without the use of characteristics that would identify 
individual subjects. We quote information only by [CONTACT_29181], 
scientific reports, or publications, in order to maintain anonymity.
i) Data Management and Confidentiality
All data will be kept confidential and utilized only for the purpose of research. Participants 
will be given coded identifiers in order to store data and link this data with each participant. 
All questionnaires, forms, and medical/laboratory tests will have the patient’s ID number with 
initials on each page but no other identifying information will be included on these forms. 
The diagnostic interviews will also only include coded identifiers and initials on all notes and 
forms. The individual managing the data will be the research coordinator and will not be 
blinded to patient names, addresses, or other personal patient information. No participant’s 
identifying data will be published. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_692838]. The research coordinator will be in charge of maintaining the database 
under PI [INVESTIGATOR_58619]. All electronic records will be kept confidential to the extent permitted 
by [CONTACT_2371], stored in a file (including the linking file) on an electronically secure database in the 
Department of Psychiatry at MSSM maintained by [CONTACT_29175]’s IT department. This database is 
password protected and only study personnel will be given the password. A backup of the 
database will be conducted each day and stored on the principal investigator’s laptop 
computer. All files (including linking files) on the laptop containing identifiers will be 
encrypted using software packages supported by [CONTACT_692869]. Only study personnel will have 
access to the database and backup. Data will be kept up to 7 years.
The data from the GCO 06-0945 online Pre-screener is stored in a secure redcap online 
database. The database has been designed such that no one has access to the subjects’ answers. 
The study team, including [CONTACT_29189] who is also the PI [INVESTIGATOR_692839] 06-0945, only has access 
to the subject’s contact [CONTACT_692870]-screener.

17Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred terms. Separate 
tabulations and listings will be produced for related adverse events, serious adverse events, 
discontinuation due to adverse events and events of at least grade 3 severities. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using either means and 95% confidence intervals 
or medians and inter-quartile ranges. The association between ketamine and positive-negative 
affect (as measured by [CONTACT_683830]-Bipolar subscale scores) will be assessed by [CONTACT_692872]. Additional predictors may be explored in the analysis, such as 
clinical and demographic variables, including age, gender, BMI, baseline anxiety. The 
influence of stress exposure and cortisol will also be examined. See below for details.
The primary behavioral outcome will be a change of the anxious-composed subscale score of 
the POMS-Bipolar at the +[ADDRESS_939621] -25-minute POMS 
scores as a within-subjects factor and treatment group as a between-subjects factor. Similar 
analyses will be done with the other behavioral measures for the secondary behavioral 
outcome (other POMS-Bi subscale scores, PANAS, VAS, BAI). In addition, time points 
beyond the 0-minute time point will be explored (15-minute, 30-minute, 45-minute, and 60-
minute). For the primary and secondary biological outcomes, similar analysis will apply to 
the HPA axis activity (measured with salivary cortisol) and the ANS activity (salivary α-
amylase) at the 0-minute, 15-minute, 30-minute, 45-minute, and 60-minute time points. 
Exploratory analysis will be performed on blood samples, to test for hormones like 
testosterone, DHEA, s-DHEA, ghrelin, and NPY, and on heart rate and blood pressure 
measurements before and after the TSST. 
j) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of subjects
All data will be obtained for research purposes only. We will collect information about 
participants’ psychiatric history, including previous treatments, medical history, and family 
history. As part of the medical evaluation, we will collect blood and urine specimens for 
analysis, and perform an ECG. The outcome of these tests will be shared with the participant. 
In the event that we detect a medical condition that requires treatment, we will provide the 
participant with an appropriate referral. 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
This study will rely on the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) created for the ongoing 
ketamine studies at DAC as an independent body charged with ensuring that the safety of 
study subjects is protected and that the scientific goals of the study are being met.

18To achieve this goal, the DSMB will perform an ongoing evaluation of the safety of patients 
participating in the clinical trial. This includes monitoring adverse events and overall clinical 
outcomes in the studies. Through this process, the board will evaluate the need for study 
termination and/or modification of study criteria for inclusion, exclusion, or discontinuation. 
In addition, the DSMB will be responsible for the evaluation of the adherence to written 
protocols regarding the protection of human subjects and the assurance of identity protection 
as specified in the Data Sharing Section. The DSMB will expeditiously review all serious 
adverse events and perform ongoing scheduled reviews of non-serious adverse events and 
study dropouts.
Investigators will submit biannual reports to the DSMB. The DSMB reports will include a 
summary of all safety findings, as well as an assessment of protocol compliance and data 
quality. Any recommendations to improve patient safety, protocol adherence, or data quality 
will be made in the biannual DSMB report. If at any time during the course of the study, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_692840], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_692841].
Adverse Events (AE) will be summarized by [CONTACT_692873]. Grading of adverse events will follow standard FDA guidelines and will utilize the 
MSSM adverse events tracking form template. Specifically, all adverse events will be graded 
as either serious or non-serious. In addition, adverse events will be graded in terms of the 
outcome, duration, intensity, and causality.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_692842]. The following elements will 
be monitored: recruitment procedures and pace; adherence to the exclusion/inclusion criteria; 
deviation from protocol; the timeliness of documentation and data entry; and the accuracy and 
confidentiality of all information both in study documents and study database. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_692843] a report on data quality and completeness. At a minimum, this will 
include an overview of the progress of patient intake and retention; summary reports 
describing patient compliance with visits, evaluations and dosing as described in the protocol; 
and a summary of the completeness and quality of key data elements needed to characterize 
patients, their dosing, and their primary and secondary outcomes. These reports will be used 
by [CONTACT_692874].
In the event of temporary or permanent suspension of the study the DSMB and the FDA will 
be notified. The IRB will also be notified should a temporary or permanent suspension occur.

19Subjects may withdraw at any point in the study as long as they provide consent. The study 
doctor, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_692844]. This may be because the research study is being stopped, the instructions of 
the study team have not been followed, the investigators believe it is in the patient’s best 
interest, or for any other reason. All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any 
time, for any reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. Reasonable attempts 
will be made by [CONTACT_29170] a reason for subject withdrawals. Subjects who 
discontinue the study will be invited to complete a final safety check and study exit procedures 
as early discontinuation visit (vital signs, a physical exam, blood chemistries, and an EKG 
will be performed). 
5) Risks to Subjects
Though we have made every effort to reduce the potential risks associated with study procedures, 
the following sources of potential discomfort or harm could not be eliminated:
Risk related to Ketamine
Ketamine is a sedative/analgesic and general anesthetic for human and veterinary use. It may 
produce mild to moderate increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output due to its 
sympathomimetic effects and can provoke ischemia in patients with underlying coronary artery 
disease. Overall, however, ketamine has a favorable acute safety profile. Over the past several 
decades, ketamine has been administered as an anesthetic to several million adults and children.
The reported incidence of ketamine-induced perceptual disturbances varies from less than 5% to 
greater than 30% (Knox et al. 1970; White et al. 1980) and may manifest as vivid dreaming, 
visualization of psychedelic color, suspension in space, kaleidoscopic floating, and out-of-body 
experiences. Some patients describe these psychic experiences as bizarre or frightening, while 
others find them pleasurable, joyful, and fascinating. Indeed, ketamine is also known as “Special 
K” as a drug of abuse related to PCP. For that reason ketamine was placed in Schedule III of the 
Controlled Substance Act in 1999. Nonetheless, when perceptual disturbances occur, they are 
usually mild and of short duration (Green and Johnson 1990). Ketamine administration has 
transient effects on symptoms, usually lasting less than 60 minutes and rarely lasting longer than 
2 hours (Carpenter 1999). The perceptual disturbances may be more common in those with 
preexisting psychosis (Lahti et al. 1995).
Several studies have addressed the question of prolonged psychological effects in the general 
population secondary to its anesthetic use and concluded that ketamine does not place patients at 
a greater risk than other anesthetics (Hersack 1994; Reich and Silvay 1989; Schorn and Witwam 
1980). There is no evidence in these long-term studies that individuals exposed to ketamine are at 
risk of abusing it on follow-up.

[PHONE_422]
[EMAIL_451]
20Both us and others have safely used ketamine in a large number of psychophysiological studies in 
patients with psychiatric disorders as well as in healthy with doses similar to that of the present 
study. A meta-analysis of a number of these studies found no evidence of behavioral sensitization 
following repeated ketamine exposure (Cho et al. 2005). 
Risk related to midazolam
Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_692845]. 
Intravenous midazolam has been associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_692846], 
especially when used for sedation in noncritical care settings. In some cases, where this was not 
recognized promptly and treated effectively, death or hypoxic encephalopathy has resulted. To 
protect study participant from the following risk continuous monitoring of respi[INVESTIGATOR_692847], and personnel trained in ACLS will be available. Reactions such as agitation, 
involuntary movements, hyperactivity and combativeness have also been reported in adult and 
pediatric patients. Other side effect related to the administration of midazolam are hiccoughs, 
nausea, vomiting coughing ‘‘over sedation’’ headache and drowsiness. Reactions at the site of the 
injection, as tenderness, pain, redness, phlebitis have been reported.”
Psychological Screening
Subjects that meet exclusion criteria may become distressed when informed. All information will 
be shared in a private office with the door closed and a trained study team member will be available 
to offer information, support, and referral for any services indicated.
Medical Screening 
Participants may experience minor discomfort or pain when a needle is used to draw blood. 
Bruising, infection, and dizziness are also common side effects. Risks of venipuncture are 
minimized by [CONTACT_692875]. Infection is 
avoided by [CONTACT_186430]. 
Privacy risks
There always exists the potential for loss of private information; however, there are procedures in 
place to minimize this risk. Please refer to sections h. “Data Management and Confidentiality” and 
i. “Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of subjects” for additional information
7) Provisions for Research Related Injury
We have described above the potential risks of the research procedures and the safeguards that will 
be used to minimize risks. These include termination of research participation if it is believed that 
such participation endangers a patient’s welfare. Monitoring procedures are used to evaluate 
potential side effects of treatment or of research procedures. The protocol stipulates an extensive

are monitored for potential reactions during the clinical trial.
8) Potential Benefits to Subjects
The possible benefits to the patient and to others are reasonable in relation to the risks of this study. 
All study participants will receive without cost an extensive clinical evaluation. No other direct 
benefits result from study participation.
9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
If an individual appears to meet enrollment criteria and is interested in participating, a face-to-face 
interview will be conducted by [CONTACT_692876]. The nature of the project, 
procedures, relative risks and benefits, and alternatives to participation in this project will be 
discussed with each subject. Following this discussion, the potential study participant will be given 
a copy of the consent form to review at their leisure, and any questions are answered. Study visits 
and procedures will take place at the MAP clinic. 
If the individual decides not to participate in this study, a staff member provides reasonable and 
timely assistance in obtaining an alternative referral, if so desired. The decision not to participate 
does not affect eligibility to participate in future studies, to receive treatment at Mount Sinai, or to 
receive treatment on a private basis from a referring clinician. Subjects will be also given the 
opportunity to withdraw from the study prior to analysis of their data. 
The consent process also includes documentation of permission to obtain previous medical 
records, including contact [CONTACT_370191], pharmacies, and family members, if needed. 
The IRB-approved forms for informed consent are made part of the patient’s permanent medical 
record, with a copy filed in the research chart.
10) Economic Impact on Subjects
Participants will incur no costs for their participation in the study. All costs associated with 
participation in the study will be covered by [CONTACT_679509].
However, if a study doctor arranges a patient to have additional medical tests which are not part 
of the study but needed for regular health care, subjects may have to pay for these if they are not 
covered by [CONTACT_150401].

as described in Table 1 “Schedule of Assessments, Outcome Measures, Labs and Procedures”.
12) Consent Process
If an individual appears to meet enrollment criteria and is interested in participating, a face-to-face 
interview will be conducted by [CONTACT_281356]. If the study screen is preformed 
remotely, the subject will be sent a copy of the approved consent form, a study doctor will discuss 
the consent form with the potential participant over a tele-communication platform, and the 
signature [CONTACT_692884]. Referring clinicians will be asked to inform potential participants of the possible 
alternatives to participating in the study. A release of information will be obtained for review of 
any available historical and clinical data. A written authorization form is also obtained from each 
patient, permitting the research team to use, create, or disclose his or her PHI for research purposes. 
A qualified staff member will discuss the nature of the project, procedures, relative risks and 
benefits, and alternatives to participation in the project with each potential study participant. 
Following this discussion, the subject will be given a copy of the consent form to review at their 
leisure, and any questions are answered. Study visits and procedures will take place at the 
Depression and Anxiety Center or via HIPAA-compliant telecommunication platform. A study 
physician will seek written voluntary informed consent from all participants prior to study entry. 
The initial consent form describes the nature of the procedures and time requirements, potential 
risks, the confidentiality of information, and the rights of research participants. If the individual 
remains interested in the project, written informed consent is obtained by a study physician, and 
medical and psychiatric screening procedures are undertaken to confirm eligibility. A copy of the 
consent form is provided to all participants. If the individual decides not to participate in this study,

previous medical records, including contact [CONTACT_370191], pharmacies, and family 
members. The study will be using the standard PPHS consent form. If the study screen is preformed 
remotely, the subject will be sent a copy of the approved consent form, a study doctor will discuss 
the consent form with the potential participant over a tele-communication platform, and the 
signature [CONTACT_692884].
13) Process to Document Consent in Writing
We will be using the standard PPHS consent template to document consent. If the study screen is 
preformed remotely, the signature [CONTACT_692885].
14) Vulnerable Populations
The proposed study does not involve vulnerable populations, such as fetuses, neonates, pregnant 
women, children, prisoners, institutionalized individuals, or others who may be considered 
vulnerable populations. Non-English speaking subjects will also not be enrolled in this study. Our 
staff is primary English speaking and is trained to use standardized diagnostic and rating tools are 
in English. Although non-English speaking individuals may be consented with appropriate 
translation services, we would not be able to diagnose and rate such individuals using the same 
standards. All participants are adults who are able to freely consent to research.

19) Control of Drugs, Biologics, or Devices
The pharmacist prepares the IV medication (ketamine and midazolam) in a 100 ml NS bag, and 
qualified personnel (e.g., nurse from the CRU) come to retrieve it the morning of infusion, such 
that a fixed dose of ml per kg is administered. Ketamine and midazolam will be stored and 
dispensed by [CONTACT_692877]. Ketamine / midazolam infusions may take place in the Psychiatry Infusion Suite which 
is located at [ADDRESS_939622], Team 7000 will be called. The Psychiatry Infusion 
Suite is equipped with monitoring devices for vitals and EKG. Additionally, the infusion is 
conducted under the constant supervision of a trained provider who can interrupt the infusion if 
needed. Due to the short half-lives of ketamine and midazolam, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_692848]. If needed, a crash cart is available in the Infusion Suite.
20) Adverse Experience Reporting and Documentation
a) Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered an 
investigational product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. 
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current IB or prescribing information for a marketed compound. Also, 
reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented AE constitute unexpected AEs. For example, an event more specific or more 
severe than described in the IB would be considered “unexpected”.
An AE therefore can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including laboratory 
finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with participation in an investigational 
study, whether or not considered drug-related.  In addition to new events, any increase in 
the severity or frequency of a pre-existing condition that occurs after the subject signs a 
consent form for participation is considered an AE. This includes any side effect, injury, 
toxicity, or sensitivity reaction.
Any condition, laboratory abnormality, or physical finding with an onset date prior to the 
subject signing consent for study participation is considered to be pre-existing in nature 
and part of the subject’s medical history.

[EMAIL_451]
25AE Severity
List criteria for AEs (such as the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, if used) and the version should be used to assess and grade AE 
severity, including laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The 
modified criteria can be found in the study manual. If the experience is not covered in the 
modified criteria, the guidelines shown below should be used to grade severity. It should 
be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not 
necessarily serious.
AE Relationship to Study Drug
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following 
guidelinesSeverity (Toxicity Grade) Description
Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of 
the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.
Moderate (2) Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].
Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
Relationship to 
DrugComment
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_425667].

26b) Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:
Death
Life threatening experience defined as any adverse experience that places the 
subject, in the view of the treating physician, at immediate risk of death at the time 
of occurrence; ie, it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] 
(except scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29128]-acute, unrelated cause such as an 
elective surgery)
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of an exposed subject
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it jeopardizes the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_939623] or require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed.Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_455130]; and that is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_78456]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_82978].
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that 
suspected drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of 
other factors.
Unlikely An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the Investigational Product, and that could readily have 
been produced by a number of other factors.
Unrelated An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the 
study drug.

27AE/SAE Reporting Procedures to Mount Sinai PPHS (IRB)
AEs are reportable to the IRB within 5 business days (SAEs within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event) when they meet the following definition:
Any ‘harm’ experienced by a subject or other individual that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_29129]/SAEs with an onset date after the subject signs consent for study participation 
must be reported to the IRB at the time of annual renewal. Details of the event must 
include severity, relationship to study drug, duration, action taken, and outcome.
All AE/SAEs that are considered related to study drug must be followed to resolution or 
stabilization if improvement is not expected. AE/SAEs that completely resolve and then 
recur should be recorded as a new AE/SAE. AE/SAEs continuing at [ADDRESS_939624] a comment in the source documents by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_692849].
21) Protocol Violations
A protocol violation occurs when the subject, investigator fails to adhere to significant protocol 
requirements affecting the inclusion, exclusion, subject safety and primary endpoint criteria. 
Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Use of a prohibited concomitant medication
- Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result 
in a protocol violation. The investigator will determine if a protocol violation 
will result in withdrawal of a subject
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol 
Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by [CONTACT_3786]. A copy of the form will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder.
22) Data Quality Control and Reporting
After data have been entered into the study database, a system of computerized data validation 
checks will be implemented and applied to the database on a regular basis. Queries are entered, 
tracked, and resolved through the EDC system directly. Query reports (Data Clarification 
Requests) pertaining to data omissions and discrepancies will be forwarded to the Investigators for 
resolution. The study database will be updated in accordance with the resolved queries. All 
changes to the study database will be documented.

 I. Introduction  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_22310]. COPD exacerbations may lead to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which make up the largest proportion of the total direct health- care cost of the disease 
and are a significant burden for patients and family. Chronic bronchitis, defined as chronic cough with 
sputum production for at least 3 months a year for 2 consecutive years, is one of the clinical manifestations of COPD. Chronic bronchitis doubles the risk of COPD exacerbations and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and is associated with increased dyspnea, worse health -related quality of life, and poorer 
quality of sleep. Chronic bronchitis also results in increased air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_22311], which 
decreases exercise capacity. Unfortunately, other than traditional inhaled pharma cological agents, there 
are no treatment options for COPD patients with chronic bronchitis.  
Heated, humidified high -flow air (HHHFA) devices improve airway clearance. HHHFA use for an 
average of 1.[ADDRESS_21530] of HHHFA during  sleep on clinically relevant short -term outcomes including: respi[INVESTIGATOR_037], quality of life and sleep, lung function and exercise capacity.  
Hypothesis 1:  HHHFA during sleep in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis improves respi[INVESTIGATOR_037], slee p quality, lung function, and exercise capacity.  
Aim 1: To examine the effect of HHHFA during sleep on respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], sleep quality, lung 
function, and exercise capacity in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis.  
The effect of HHHFA on air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a nd hyperinflation has not been studied. Air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_22312] (e.g. airway wall thickness) can be measured using chest CT.  
Hypothesis 2: HHHFA during sleep in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis improves air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_22311].  
Aim 2:  To examine the effect of HHHFA in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis during sleep on air 
trappi[INVESTIGATOR_22313].  
Desig n: We will include COPD subjects with a post- bronchodilator FEV1%predicted below 70% and 
chronic bronchitis. We will include subjects with at least [ADDRESS_21531] year to identify 
patients with significant burden due to chronic bronchitis. We will exclude subjects with recent 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_22314], stable COPD 
participants. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to HHHFA (intervention arm)  or 
usual care (usual ca re arm) . At baseline we will perform measurements in all subjects that include 
dyspnea, cough,  health -related quality of life, and sleep quality questionnaires , spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], a 6- minute 
walk test, and chest CT. The HHHFA device will be provided to participa nts at the baseline visit.

 Subjects will use the device during sleep for 6 weeks and return for an end- of-study visit. At the follow -
up visit  (6 weeks) , participants will repeat all baseline evaluations. At the follow -up visit, participants 
using the HHHFA will be asked whether they want to continue to participate in the sub -study. For 
participants that have consented to participate in the sub-study, they will use the HHHFA device for an 
additional 42 weeks. We will follow the se participants who continue to use the  HHHFA for 42 additional 
weeks (total 48 weeks) to assess for respi[INVESTIGATOR_22315].   
We will compare changes in variables (e.g. FEV1 etc ) over time  in each treatment group. We will also 
compare changes in variabl es over time between groups. To evaluate the effect of treatment , we will use 
linear mixed effect models controlling for demographics and lung function.

 II. Background  
COPD is a leading cause of mortality in the U.S.[1]  and worldwide [2] and is asso ciated with high 
morbidity [3] and resource utilization [3], including costs due to clinic visits, chronic therapy, and frequent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].[3, 4]  COPD patients experience respi[INVESTIGATOR_22316], cough, and sputum production.[5]  
Severe acute COPD exacerbations require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22317] a 5 -year mortality of 50- 76%. [6-10] 
Fifty percent of patients admitted to the inte nsive care unit (ICU) with COPD exacerbations are re-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22318] 6 months of discharge. [9] COPD exacerbations also reduce patients’ quality of 
life.[11] Moreover, direct health care expenditures for COPD in 2010 were $32.1 billion and projected to 
increase to $49 billion by 2020.[12]  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22319] 70% of these direct health care costs. [4, 13]  Preventing COPD exacerbations, in particular 
those requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], would improve patients’ quality of life and decrease health care costs of 
the disease. Therefore, preventing COPD exacerbations is of major importance.  
Chronic bronchitis is associated with worse quality of life, exacerbations, and mortality  
COPD is a hete rogenous disease with various phenotypes.[14]  Identifying those COPD phenotypes is 
critical to individualizing treatment for COPD and improving outcomes. [15] Chronic bronchitis, defined 
as chronic cough with sputum production for at least 3 months a year for 2 consecutive years, accelerates 
lung function decline, is associated with more dys pnea and worse health- related quality of life, [16] 
increases exacerbation s and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], [16-20] and may increase mortality. [21, 22]  Prior studies 
have shown that COPD patients with chronic bronchitis experience twice as many exacerbations and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22320]. [16, 19, 23]  Chronic bronchitis is a risk 
factor for exacerbations independent of lung function impa irment. [24] More than half of COPD patients 
with chronic bronchitis have more than 2 exacerbations every year. [18] Even in smokers with normal 
lung function, sputum production is associated with increased risk for respi[INVESTIGATOR_22315]. [25] 
In addition, chronic bronchitis is associated with poor quality of sleep and awakening during the 
night.[16, 26]  Poor quality sleep is very common among COPD patients. Sputum production is the most 
prominent  factor associated with poor sleep in COPD. [27] Thus, more effective treatment of COPD 
patients with chronic bronchitis would have a great impact on disease burden and likely reduce associated health care costs.  
Chronic bronchitis is associated with air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_22321] [28] likely due to 
airway secret ions. COPD patients with chronic bronchitis have been shown to cover shorter distances in a 
6-minute walk test compared to COPD patients without chronic bronchitis.[28]  COPD patients with 
chronic bronchitis have larger function residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC), and greater airway wall thickness on chest CT than COPD patients without chronic bronchitis [16], again likely due to 
increased airway secretions. Airway mucus plugging is considered a characteristic of COPD. [29] 
Nevertheless, quantification of mucus plugging in COPD patients with ch ronic bronchitis using chest CT 
is understudied.

 Current treatment of chronic bronchitis  
Treatment of chronic bronchitis is not different than treatment of COPD in general. Apart from smoking 
cessation, inhaled pharmacological agents are the mainstay of treatment. Long- acting bronchodilators 
reduce respi[INVESTIGATOR_22322] 15 -20%. [30] Adding inhaled corticosteroids have a similar effect on 
exacerbations. [31] In a selected group of COPD patients, oral pharmacological agents and non-
pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22323]. [32] However, the 
effect of those medications in every daily life may be less. [33] Other than common inhaled 
pharmacological agents, treatment options specifically for chronic bronchitis are limited. [34] 
Randomized, placebo- controlled trials examining N -acetylcysteine, the most -known mucolytic, have 
shown disappointing results.[35, 36]  
Heated humidified high flow oxygen/air in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  
Recently, novel nasal cannula systems have become available that can deliver a heated and humidified 
air/oxygen mixt ure with a flow rate up to 60 L/minute. [37] Although the main use of these devices is to 
provide oxygen supplementation in hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], high- flow nasal cannula devices can be 
used without oxygen supplementation, providing only heating and humidification in the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_22324] (heated humidified high flow air; HHHFA). It is known that proper humidification improves airway 
clearance [38] and may preserve mucosal integrity and function, facilitate gas exchange, reduce the 
metabo lic cost of breathing, and improve airway host defense. [37] The warm and humidified gas also 
provides comfort and reduces costs of breathing. [37] The metabolic cost to warm and humidify the cold 
and dry gas provided by [CONTACT_22362]. [37]  Moreover, 
HHHFA can wash out the dead space, facilitating CO
2 removal [39] and has a positive end- expi[INVESTIGATOR_22325] (PEEP) effect [40] and, as a result, the cost of breathing is reduced.  
HHHFA may be more beneficial in patients with chronic bronchitis as it facilitates airway clearance, 
improves host defense, and decreases the metabolic cost of breathing, [37] particularly in those patients 
with recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22326].[41]  
Heated humidified high flow oxygen in patients with stable chronic obstruct ive pulmonary disease  
In a randomized, prospective trial conducted in Denmark, 200 COPD outpatients with chronic hypoxemic 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_22327] -flow nasal cannula or usual care. [42] The average high- flow 
nasal cannula was 20 L/minute for an average of 6 hours per day. Exacerbation rates were lower in the high- flow nasal cannula group (3.12 per year) relative to the usual care group (4.95 per year; p<0.001). 
Although there was no difference in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22328], increasing duration 
of high- flow nasal cannula was associated with reduction in COPD hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. One -year use of 
high- flow nasal cannula treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], from 1.39 to 0.79 per year (p<0.001).  
In a multicenter crossover trial, 32 stable COPD patients with hypoxemic and hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_22329] 6 weeks followed by 
[CONTACT_22363] 6 weeks, or oxygen supplementation alone for 6 weeks 
followed by [CONTACT_22364] 6 weeks.[43]  HHHFA was used during the 
night at flow rates between 30 and 40 L/minute. The flow rate was allowed to be decreased down to 
20L/minute for patient comfort. The average usage time was above 7 hours per night. Oxygen could be 
blended in the HHHFA device and  was adjusted to maintain the peripheral oxygen saturation above 88%.

October 8, [ADDRESS_21532] clearance in patients with bronchiectasis and chronic sputum production.[38]  In 
a prospective study in New Zealand, [ADDRESS_21533] moderate COPD or non- cystic fibrosis 
bronchiectasis, who had ≥[ADDRESS_21534] year and daily sputum production, were 
randomized to either  HHHFA at 25 L/minute or standard care for 12 months. [44] Patients randomized to 
HHHFA were instructed to use the device for at least [ADDRESS_21535] the rate of decline in 6- minute walk distances. In 
the HHHFA group, there was a 14.1 meter (4%) decline wher eas in the control group, there was a 29 
meter (8.6%) decline (p=0.485). The study showed that rate of decline of the 6- minute walk distance was 
inversely correlated with improvement of FVC. HHHFA increased the time to the first exacerbation from 
a median of 27 days to 52 days (p=0.0495). Patients using the HHHFA had 18.[ADDRESS_21536] of care group had 33.5 annual exacerbation days (p=0.045). However, exacerbation frequency was not different between the HHHFA (2.97 exacerbations per year) and regular treatment groups (3.63 exacerbations per year; p=0.067). Similarly, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22330] (0.39 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22331]) did not differ from those in the regular treatment group 
(0.47 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22332]; p=0.439). The modest effect of HHHFA can be explained by [CONTACT_22365]. The authors acknowledged that the goal of treatment adherence was [ADDRESS_21537] 4 hours during sleep and patients used it an average above 7 
hours a night. [43] Adherence was confirmed by [CONTACT_22366]. The effect of HHHFA for longer time 
periods during the night on COPD with chronic bronchitis is unknown. Moreover, the effe ct HHHFA on 
COPD patients’ sleep is unknown. In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will focus on clinically relevant short -term 
outcomes that include symptoms, quality of life, quality of sleep, lung function and exercise capacity.

October 8, [ADDRESS_21548] and they will be reminded that they may 
ask questions at any time during the procedure(s). The subject will then be placed on the 
movable exam table of the CT scanner.  
Three scans will be done in the CT scanner. One scout scan will be done to position the 
subject and then a total of two non- contrast CT scans will be done: Total Lung Capacity 
(TLC) and Residual Volume (RV).  
The first scan that will be done is called a scout scan. This brief scan, which is similar to an 
x-ray, is simply used to help the technologists  make sure that the subject is positioned 
correctly.  The subject will then be told to take in as deep of a breath as they can and hold it 
while the scout scan is done.  
Total Lung Capacity (TLC) the subject will be asked to take a deep breath and blow out  
completely two times, they will then be asked to take a deep breath and hold their breath while the CT scan is being done. This breath hold will last approximately 5- 8 seconds.  
Residual Volume (RV). For this scan, we will tell the subject to take in a deep breath and 
blow it out twice before instructing them to take another deep breath in and blowing all of 
their air out until we see they've reached 0- 10% of their SVC and then we will tell them to 
hold their breath while an image is being taken at RV (5- 10 seconds).  
Subjects will be asked to bring their cigarettes or electronic cigarettes with them to the visit.  
They will be asked to smoke one of their cigarettes or vape with their electronic cigarette.  
They will then repeat the same CT scans.  
The spi[INVESTIGATOR_20116] l volumetric scan protocols use dose modulation with 36 reference mAs, 120kV, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_22347] 1, & rotation time of 0.5sec. The CTDIvol for one scan at 36mAs is 2.41mGy, with total DLP of 81.5mGycm for a 30cm scan.

Participants will be provided the HHHFA at baseline visit (time 0). At follow -up visit (6 
weeks), participants using the HHHFA  that are not interested in  participating in the sub-
study, they can return the device at the follow -up visit (6 weeks) . Particip ants that will 
participate the sub- study they can ship the device back to the research team  at the end of the 
sub-study(48 weeks) .  
Protocol: Heated, humidified high -flow air in Chronic Bronchitis  
October 8, [ADDRESS_21549] 4 hours during their sleep but 
will be allowed to use it as lo ng as they want during sleep.[43]  HHHFA will be administered 
using myAIRVO 2 device (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare), which provided humidified high-
flow gas via Optiflow nasal cannula interface (Fisher &  Paykel Healthcare).  The temperature 
will be set at 32-37˚C and flow will be set at 35L /minute but can be titrated down to 
20L/minute for comfort based on a previous study. [44] Subjects use oxygen at night  can 
blend the oxygen at the same flow through the device. Adherence of the device will be recorded using the device log.  
 
XIII.  Possible Risks of the Study  
 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] : The subject may become short of breath or experience chest tightness while doing the 
pulmonary function tests.  
CT scans:  The subject will be exposed to radiation from the CT scans.  
Heated humidified high flow air (HHHFA):  According to a previous randomized control trials, that 
HHHFA applied during the night, s ix of 32 participants experienced adverse effects related to 
HHHFA. [43] Four participants experience night sweat, one had nasal discharge, one had insomnia, 
and one had a skin rash. Other adverse effects associated with the HHHFA device i nclude but are not 
limited to the following: fire, burns, nosebleed, dry mouth and throat, headache, trippi[INVESTIGATOR_22350], electrical shock and injury, noise irritation, low oxygen due to improper use of device, 
skin irritation and injury/damage.  
Possible Loss of Confidentiality : To reduce risk of a loss of confidentiality, precautions will be 
taken to ensure privacy. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_22351], in compliance with ICH E6 GCP, Section 4.9 and regulatory and institutional 
requirements for the protection of confidentiality of subjects. Research records generated in this study 
will be stored in file cabinets in a locked room and/or on a secure electronic database. The text 
message server sto res the minimum amount of data possible -participant phone numbers and text 
message responses, no other participant information will be stored on that server. Only authorized 
study team at the sites will have access to the data. Imaging collected during the  study will be 
identified by a subject number, IRB protocol number, and date of collection.  
Abnormal findings:  
• False positive scan, which is an abnormality that initially is of concern that is later found 
not to be a concern. Anxiety may result from false  positive results.  
• Detection of abnormalities that could lead to unnecessary testing or treatment.  
• Failure to detect an abnormality that is present and possibly miss an opportunity for care.

 XIV. Adverse Event Assessment  
Adverse event information will be coll ected from all participants at every encounter throughout the study. 
The investigator and research team will inquire about adverse events until the end of the study at the 6-
week follow up study. Medical records will be reviewed for adverse effects.  
XV. Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_22370]. Severe adverse events 
defined as those that interfere participant ’s daily activity and/or require treatment will be reported to the 
manufacturer.   
XVI. Data Management  
The following people/agencies may have access to subject data/records:  
 
• Study team  
• Federal government regulatory agencies  
• Auditing departments of the University of Iowa  
• University of Iowa IRB  
• The National Institute of Health  
To protect confidentiality, we will assign each subject a study ID. All records will be in a locked cabinet in a locked office or password protected computer system. Data and records will be managed as follows:  
• Paper/hard copy records (hard copy surveys, ques tionnaires, case report forms, pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], etc.) 
- Whenever possible, subject identifying information will be blacked out on all paper or hard 
copy records and replaced with the subject's unique study identifier. Paper records will be stored in a locked file  cabinet in the study team's locked office.  
• Electronic records (computer files, electronic databases, etc.) –  All electronic data bases will 
only be accessed by [CONTACT_22371] a username [CONTACT_22373] [CONTACT_941] P I.

XVIII.  Statistical Analysis Considerations  
 
Primary outcomes:  Sleep quality (PSQI)  
Secondary outcomes:  Dyspnea (MRC) , health -related quality of life (SGRQ and CAT), cough (CASA -
Q), lung function (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]), and exercise capacity (6- min walk distance) Chest CT measurements.  
Variables will be collected:  medical history, comorbidities, MRC, SGRQ, CAT, PSQI,  CASA -Q, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_22353], [ADDRESS_21551] measurements.  
Hypothesis 1: We expect that HHHFA will improve MRC, SGRQ, CAT, PSQI , CASA- Q scores in 
COPD patients with chronic bronchitis. It will also increase FEV1, and distanced covered in a [ADDRESS_21552].  
Hypothesis 2: We anticipate that HHHFA will reduce air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_22311].  
Decrease in air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_22354], lung 
function, and exercise capacity. The putative mechanism of that is that HHHFA improves airway 
clearance.  
Statistical considerations and power calculation. Prior studies have shown that HHHFA improves 
dyspnea, quality of life, and lung function in patients with COPD and daily sputum production. HHHFA 
has not been s hown to improve quality of sleep. A prior study has shown that the average of PSQI in 
COPD patients with FEV1%predicted above 50% is 9.3 ± 3.8(SD). [54] To achieve a power of 80% at a 
2-sided 5% level of significance to detect a c linically significant improvement in PSQI (below 5), we 
need a sample size at least 27 subjects enrolling ratio of 2:1( HHHFA: usual care). To account for an 
increased rate of attrition, our goal will be a sample of 30. 
Statistical analysis. We will compar e variables (e.g. MRC score, FEV1) between baseline and 6- week 
visits and changes over time in each group. We will use Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and 
paired t -test or Wilcoxon signed- rank test for normal and non- normal continuous variables, respectively. 
We will also compare changes in those variables (e.g. change in FEV1 betwe en baseline and 6 -week 
visits) between groups. We will use Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and t -test or Wilcoxon 
rank sum test for normal and non- normal continuous variables, respectively. To evaluate the effect of 
treatment, we will use lin ear mixed -effect models controlling for demographics and lung function.

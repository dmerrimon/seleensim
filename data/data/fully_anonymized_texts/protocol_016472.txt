Study Title  
Mindfulness -Based Dementia Care Partner Program to Reduce Depressive Symptoms   
Objectives  
 1. To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of implementation of the MBDC 
program 
2. To determine the feasibility of obtaining clinical outcome measures  
3. To assess the willingness of participants to share access to healthcare utilization 
records 
Design and Outcomes   
This study will use a stepped wedge incomplete design with random assignment to 
accommodate continuous enrollment of participants and a rolling schedule of existing  
MBDC courses. Course p articipation includes the voluntary sharing of information 
through answering questions related to burden and mood as part of an administrative data 
collected at four points as illustrated below : 
 
 
Interventions and Duration  
The Mindfulness -Based Dementia Care (MBDC) program is an adaptation of 
Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for CPs  of people living with Alzheimer’s 
disease and related dementias. The web -based, group intervention consists of nine  
sessions including weekly two -hour classes and a half -day retreat. Participants learn from 
certified instructors how to incorporate mindfulness practices into day-to -day life to help 
cope with the challenges and stresses of dementia care.  Courses currently are part of the 
memory clinic programs  at all three of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_185911].  Participants will be a part of the 
study for about 7 months including 8 weeks of intervention, a variable pre -intervention 
control period, and a 3-month follow -up period.  
Sample Size and Population  
130 adult CPs of people living with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementia will be 
recruited to enroll in the MBDC program. Recruitment will occur as part of standard of 
care in three specialty care memory clinics. Eight or more MBDC courses will be held 
over the course of one year. During registration, CPs will self -select two options for a 
preferred day and time to meet for the group class. CPs will be randomly assigned to one of the two preferred day/times  to assess the feasibility of randomiz ation  in a full scale 
embedded pragmatic clinical tr ial.

 1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective 
The primary aim  of this study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of 
implementation of the Mindfulness Based Dementia Care (MBDC ) program.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_943279] aim of this study is to  explore the feasibility of obtaining online 
consent for research access to care partner ( CP) and person living with dementia (PLWD)  
healthcare utilization records.  
 
2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
More than 11 million people provide unpaid care for people living with dementia 
(PLWD) in the [LOCATION_002].1 While there are certain positive aspects of being a care 
partner (CP) and caregiving, copi[INVESTIGATOR_695239]’s progressive loss of memory and ability to function in daily life can be particularly challenging and stressful. The increased 
burden and chronic s tress of caregiving can lead to increased risk of mental health issues, 
as well as physical health changes.
2,3,[ADDRESS_943280] increased incidence of chronic conditions, including heart disease and hypertension, 
as well as higher utilization of healthcare services.2,5 CPs also experience high rates of 
anxiety and depression.6 Increased depressive symptoms are associated with higher CP 
healthcare utilization.7 In a recent meta-analysis, depression was prevalent in 34% and 
anxiety in 44% of CPs of PLWD.8 The odds of having depression were 1.5 times higher 
for females than males and 2.5 times higher for spousal CPs.8 
2.2 Study Rationale  
Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a group-based, standardized program that is both psychoeducation and skills -based, which uses mindfulness meditation 
practices to help people better cope with their emotions.
[ADDRESS_943281] (www.presencecareproject.com), a community -based non-profit organization, has 
developed a version of MBSR designed specifically for CPs of PLWD called 
Mindfulness Based Dementia Care.21 Mindfulness Based Dementia Care (MBDC) is an 
nine-week group program, which includes both formal and informal mindfulness 
practice, role play, and lectures, combined with dementia-specific education and CP peer support. MBDC is recognized as a Dementia Care Program on the Best Practice Caregiving website, a partnershi p between Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging and Family 
Caregiver Alliance. MBDC participants learn how to incorporate mindfulness practices 
into day-to -day life as a CP to help cope with the challenges and stresses of dementia 
care. CPs participating in MBD C make changes to their thinking, becoming more self -
aware and mindful. These behavior changes are thought to lead to an increased ability to 
cope with emotions as measured by [CONTACT_695257] 
(Figure 1).  
Figure 1.  Intervention Framework 
 
MBDC is currently being taught at memory care clinics in the [LOCATION_002] by 
[CONTACT_695258]. The cost of conducting a MBDC course is estimated to be in the range of $3,000-$4,000, depending on the site. Healthcare systems have typi[INVESTIGATOR_695240].

TUDY DESIGN 
Design:  The overall goal of this proposal is to test the feasibility of implementing MBDC 
to guide subsequent evaluation of effectiveness of the MBDC intervention in a full -scale 
embedded pragmatic clinical trial (ePCT). This study will use a stepped wedge incomplete design with random assignment to accommodate continuous enrollment of participants and a rolling schedule of initiating MBDC courses. We aim to examine the 
effects of MBDC on depressive symptoms and burden in CPs of PLWD. CPs will be 
referred t o MBDC  from three healthcare settings and surrounding community partners. 
MBDC program registration and collection of administrative data will occur via Presence Care’s web-based platform.  MBDC courses will be taught in groups via web-based video 
calls by [CONTACT_695258] , including one by [CONTACT_1629] A frican American 
trainee . Eight or more courses will be taught over [ADDRESS_943282] two preferred days/times for class and will be randomized to one of them. Participants may not be assigned to the instructor at their memory clinic. With up to 15 
participants anticipated per course, a total of up to 130 CPs will be enrolled. 
Administrative data will be collected at the time of registration, prior to the MBDC course, immediately  following the MBDC course, and 3 months later  (Figure 4). The 

Page [ADDRESS_943283] data for recruitment purposes.  The administrative data collected by [CONTACT_695259]; no HIPAA authorization/waiver is required, but the data 
obtained by [CONTACT_695260] a data use agreement.   
Study population:  The study 
population consists of CPs of 
PLWD from three settings. Multiple strategies described 
below will be used to increase the 
diversity of CP participating in MBDC. 
Settings:  The three healthcare settings that will refer CPs to MBDC in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_506514]:  
• the HealthPartners Center for Memory & Aging in St. Paul, MN;  
• the Ray Dolby [CONTACT_695261], a Sutter 
Health affiliate in San Francisco, CA; and  
• the University of Michigan – Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in Ann Arbor, 
MI.  
Challenges to conducting ePCTs in CPs include the lack of pragmatically available 
clinical outcomes and the complexity of collecting and harmonizing data across multiple, diverse healthcare systems. MBDC e valuation data is currently being collected at the 
three pi[INVESTIGATOR_695241].  To overcome these challenges, we will partner with 
Presence Care to develop and implement a permanent centralized process for MBDC 
class registration and administrative data collection on their website. This upgraded infrastructure will enable the collection of common administrative data, including 
questionnaires with clinical outcomes, for long -term use in evaluation of the program.  
Randomization scheme:  At the time of enrollment (registration on the Presence Care 
site), a CP will be presented with several currently enrolling class options (multiple 
days/times of week) and asked to select two that work with their schedule. They will then 
be randomly enrol led in one of the two selected courses, allowing for randomization on 
the class level while still accommodating the participant’s schedule. If a CP declines the 
assigned MBDC course, they will be allowed to self -select a course or to withdraw. As 
randomiza tion is planned for the full -scale ePCT, it is important to determine 
acceptability of this component of implementation.  This is balanced with the health care 
settings needs to support care partners experiencing stress.

 Intervention Structure and 
Implementation Protocol:  
MBDC group sessions will be 
held virtually via web -based 
video calls. Presence Care 
certified instructors will facilitate the sessions according to the 
MBDC protocol. Nine  sessions 
including 8 weekly classes (2 
hours each) and  a retreat (4 hours) 
will cover several topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (Table 
1). The session taught by [CONTACT_695262] -person group meetings 
in that community church setting. 
The core course content for each session will be recorded for individuals who are unable 
to attend  the live session . In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], a phone option for CP participation will also be 
made available. There is currently a group of MBDC graduate meeting weekly by [CONTACT_648]. Many of the CP s participating prefer the phone interaction vs. video call. We will e xplore 
whether phone participation increases access for participants with lower socioeconomic status and describe any differences in the intervention fidelity.   
Instructors will reach out to CPs that miss class sessions with an email checking in and includ e a link to the recording. CPs will be asked to watch the session and send the 
instructor a summary  about the content to  make up the session. Instructors may withdraw 
CPs who miss more than 3 sessions. CPs will be mailed one chapter of the MBDC 
workbook for each class (Appendix 1).  The CP workbook is currently available in 
English for in -person and virtual classes. Presence Care is currently in the process of 
upda ting the in-person Spanish MBDC workbook for the virtual class mode.   Upon 
completion of the course, participants will be offered the opportunity to participate in a variety of mindfulness maintenance activities , such as weekly, guided virtual group 
meetings of MBDC graduates . 
The Presence Care website will be upgraded to include a permanent infrastructure for 
centralized registration and administrative data collection. Data collection will be 
completed through Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  and will include  clinical 
outcomes and program evaluation questionnaires . REDCap is a secure web -based system 
used for data collection and is compliant with federal regulations (21 CFR Part 11, 
FISMA, HIPAA, and GDPR). A Presence Care administrator will have access to the entire da taset and each instructor will have access to their participants’ data. A data use 
agreement between Presence Care and HealthPartners Institute will be executed for the 
research use of data. Through this agreement, the HealthPartners biostatistician will have access to a limited data set through the REDCap portal.  
Data sources, elements, and collection protocol:  Table [ADDRESS_943284] is the Presence Care administrative 
database. All CP and PLWD data will be entered by [CONTACT_695263]. There will be no Table 1. MBDC Session  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_695242]

course evaluation  and a theoretical  assessment of willingness to share healthcare 
utilization data. Our Aim 3 goal is to determine whether CPs will be willing to consent 
online to share their insurance information evaluate healthcare utilization in future 
studies. The question would be “In the future, we wish to study how the MBDC a ffects 
health care utilization. If we were to do so, w ould you be willing to provide your 
Medicare ID number  to help us understand how this program affects your health?  Please 
note that we are not asking you to provide this information now, nor are collecting your 
utilization data .” A second question will ask if they are a legally authorized individual for 
the PLWD, and if so, would they theoretically consent to also sharing the Medicare ID of 
that individual. We will not collect the Medicare ID number but  ask theoretically if they 
would consider participating  and offer the choices of “yes/no/I don’t know”.

4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS   
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
During the online MBDC registration process, CPs will be asked yes/no questions to 
determine eligibility based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Branching logic within the survey will prompt messaging for those are ineligible and trigger an exit from the registration process.  In addition, instructors will confirm eligibility of CPs during the 
check -in calls.  
Participants  must meet all the following inclusion criteria to participate in this study  
• Age ≥18 years  
• Self-identify as being an informal  CP providing caregiving to a PLWD  
• Register for an MBDC course through the Presence Care Website 
4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
All candidates meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from 
study participation.  
• Previous participation in an MBDC program.  
• Does not speak and understand either English.  
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Recruitment:  Each pi[INVESTIGATOR_695243] [ADDRESS_943288] at each site for r eferring CPs , and classes being held virtually due to the COVID -19 pandemic. . 
Participants will be referred from memory care clinics at each of the three aligned healt hcare settings  using flyers . Flyers are handed out by [CONTACT_15098] (physicians, advance -
practice providers, neuropsychologists) during clinic visits to those CPs they feel would benefit from the program.  Referrals using flyers at clinics may also occur during  
conversations with non-clinician s taff (social work, Care Ecosystem). Flyers are posted 
on the clinic website and public spaces in the clinic. Partnerships with community-based programs surrounding the pi[INVESTIGATOR_695244] C flyers 
with local day programs and the Alzheimer’s Association. Interested CPs referred to the 
MBDC program will visit the Presence Care website to register using the centralized 
system.  
Page [ADDRESS_943289] and healthcare claims data, and mail letters with MBDC flyers to 
families with over -sampling of non-white and Hispanic patients. The study team 
programmer will identify patients using  ICD-10 diagnostic code s for dementia or mild 
cognitive impairment (F00 -F03, G30-G31.9) documented at  least two outpatient or 
inpatient encounters or if present on  to the problem list (a list of diagnoses on a patient’s 
electronic health record  dashboard) in the electronic health record . At HealthPartners, 
patients can opt out of use of their data for research. We will exclude patients from mailings who have declined permission for their medical records to be used in research. 
CPs interested in participating  will be directed to visit the  Presence Care website to 
register using the centralized system.  
Randomization scheme:  As described above  in Section 3 , at the time of enrollment 
(registration on the Presence Care site), a CP will be presented with several currently 
enrolling class options (multiple days/times of week) and asked to select two that work with their schedule. They will then be randomly enrolled in one of the two selected 
courses, allowing for randomization on the class level while still accommodating the 
participant’s schedule.  
Consenting:  Participation in the MBDC program will be completely voluntary.  We plan 
to seek a waiver of informed consent for all aspects of the study.  Please see section 11.2 
for details.  
 
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS   
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
MBDC group sessions will be held virtually via web-based video calls with a phone option available. Presence Care certified instructors will facilitate the sessions and use the 
MBDC participant Workbook (Appendix 1 ). Nine  sessions including 8 weekly classes (2 
hours each) and a half -day retreat  (4 hours)  will cover several topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (Table 1).  
The core course content for each session will be recorded for individuals who are unable 
to attend. As taught in the Presence Care certification, i nstructors will reach out to CPs 
that miss class sessions with an informal email including a link to the recording. CPs will 
be asked to watch the session and send the instructor a brief summary about the content 
in order to make up the session. CPs will be e mailed one chapter of the MBDC workbook  
for each class (Appendix 1).  The CP workbook is currently availabl e in English for in -
person and virtual classes. Presence Care is currently in the process of updating t he in -
person Spanish MBDC workbook for the virtual class mode.   Upon completion of the 
course, participants will be offered the opportunity to participate in a variety of 
mindfulness maintenance activities , such as weekly, guided virtual group meetings of 
MBDC graduates .

6.2 Description of Evaluations  
There are no research visits in this pragmatic trial.  Below we describe the administrative 
data collection occurring as part of course registration and follow -up.  
6.2.1 Screening Evaluation  
Registration  
Care partners referred using flyers that are interested in the MBDC program will be 
directed to register on the Presence Care website. The website will contain 
information about the MBDC  course  and what is expected for participation. It will 
also include screening questions regarding the inclusion/exclusion criteria. When CPs confirm their interest, they will be directed to answer questions regarding their 
demographics, contact [CONTACT_3031], referral source, caregiving information, PLWD 
information, and preferred course times/dates.  Next, there will be  questionnaires that 
include the clinical outcome scales and behavior change measures.  
In th is pragmatic clinical trial, enrollment is consid ered the act of completing 
registration for MBDC on the Presence Care Website.  
There is a variable time period  between CP registration and randomization. In this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we also include a  phone option for registration with a staff member . For this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we will use a HealthPartners research staff member  to speak with CPS and enter 
the information given to them verbally into the Presence Care website registration 
link. We will assess the use of these phone services to determine if this is mode is 
needed for the full scale ePCT.  
 
6.2.2 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization 
Randomization 
Four weeks before a course is scheduled to start, CPs will be randomized to attend one of the two indicated as preferred days/times.  They will be contact[CONTACT_695267].  If a CP declines the 
assigned MBDC course, they will be given the option to choose their preferred day and time .  We are assessing the feasibility of randomization and do not want to 
withhold the MBDC program from those for whom this is not  feasible.  
Instructor Check -In 
About two or three weeks prior to the course initiation , instructors will contact 
[CONTACT_695268] a brief phone call  (approximately 15 min)  to discuss the MBDC 
program. They will review the inclusion/exclusion criteria, ensure the program is a 
good fit, and confirm that the CP understands the time commitment involved. These 
check -ins are a normal part of teaching  MBDC. 
Pre-Course Survey 
Ten days prior to course initiation , CPs will receive an email with a link to a 
questionnaire. There will be 3 automated reminders (every 3 days) if the survey is not 
Page [ADDRESS_943291]-Course Survey (Q3)  
Three days after  course completion , CPs will receive an email with a link to a 
questionnaire. This survey will include clinical outcome scales and behavior change 
measures  in addition to course satisfaction questions and healthcare claims access 
questions. There will be 3 automated reminders (every 5 days) if the survey is not 
completed. Research assistants will call CPs who registered via phone to obtain the 
data.  
After the conclusion of all MBDC courses, the study team will conduct a one -hour  
interview with the director of the specialty clinic at each Memory Clinic Directors . 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_695245].  
6.2.4 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
Follow -Up Survey (Q4)  
Three months  after course completion, CPs will receive an email with a link to a 
questionnaire. In the survey, there will be a statement of implied consent prior to the clinical outcome scales and behavior change measures.  There will be 3 automated 
reminders (every 5 days) if the survey is not completed.  Staff  will call CPs who 
registered via phone to obtain the data.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_943292] course surveys (the opposite results than we expect), 
we will discuss whether MBDC implemented in this manner is either not effective or 
doing harm and make changes.

SAE Definition:  SAEs consist of any adverse event that results in death; is life 
threatening or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; causes persistent or significant disability or incapacit y; results in congenital anomalies or birth defects; is another condition which 
investigators judge to represent significant hazards.  
Unanticipated Problem (UP) Definition:  any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all the following criteria: 
• unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the s tudy population;  
• related or possibly related to participation in the research;  
• suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.

the MBDC program with no reports of adverse events. There is a small potential for increased stress as a part of participation in the MBDC program.  
SAEs for this study include:   No SAE are expected. More than [ADDRESS_943295] completed 
the MBDC program with no reports of adverse events . 
Page 18 of 32 
 Process for identifying AEs, SAEs, and UPs:  AEs, SAEs and UPs related to 
participation in the MBDC program will be collected by [CONTACT_695269] (REDCap system) where CP participation, such as 
attendance is collected. Entry of AEs, SAEs, and UPs will trigger an alert to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_695246] (and investigate if necessary), then categorize its severity, expectedness, and 
potential relatedness.  
Reporting schedule:  
 All adverse events that are serious (SAE) and unexpected (i.e., have not been previously reported for the study’s intervention) will be reported to the IMPACT 
Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team Leader ([CONTACT_286445]), NIA IMPACT 
Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_572445]), and the IMPACT Collaboratory  
Safety Officer within 48 hours of the study’s knowledge of SAE.  
• Only those adverse events that are serious (SAE), unexpected, and related to the 
intervention must also be reported to Advarra IRB.  Unexpected and unrelated 
SAEs will be reported to Advarra IRB on a case -by-case basis if requested by [CONTACT_695270].  
 All deaths will be reported to IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team 
Leader ([CONTACT_286445]), NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_695287]), and the IMPACT Collaboratory   Safety Officer within 24 hours 
of study’s knowledge of death.  
• Advarra IRB does not require the specific reporting of death outside of the SAE 
reporting requirement above, but they will be notified on a case -by-case basis if 
requested by [CONTACT_695271].  
 All unanticipated problems (UPs) will be reported to the IMPACT Collaboratory 
Regulatory and Data Team Leader ([CONTACT_286445]), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT 
Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_572445]), and the IMPACT Collaboratory   
Safety Officer within 48 hours of the study’s knowledge of the event.  
 The summaries of all previously reported unexpected and related SAEs, deaths, 
and UPs, as well as all other SAEs and AEs will be reported to IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team Lead ([CONTACT_286445]), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_572445]), and the IMPACT 
Collaboratory  Safety Officer at a minimum every [ADDRESS_943296] 
Collaboratory PO.  
7.3.1 Reporting Procedures  
All data and safety monitoring reporting will classify SAEs and AEs as to their severity, 
expectedness, and potential relatedness to the study intervention as per the definitions 
below:  
Severity  
Page 19 of 32 
 • Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor 
irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not 
require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate:  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by 
[CONTACT_14212]; moderate experiences may cause some interference 
with functioning  
• Severe:   Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating  
Expectedness  
• Unexpected  - nature or severity of the event is not consistent with information 
about the condition under study or intervention in the protocol, consent form, 
product brochure, or investigator brochure.  
• Expected  - event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition 
under study.  
Relatedness   
• Definitely Related:   The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational 
agent/procedure – i.e. an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention, follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected intervent ion, that is confirmed by [CONTACT_45452][INVESTIGATOR_366245]’s clinical 
state.  
• Possibly Related:   An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected intervention, but that could readily have been 
produced by a number of other factors.  
• Not Related:  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational 
agent/procedure - i.e. another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a 
clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event 
and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically 
implausible.  
7.3.2 Follow-up for Adverse Events  
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to 
the attention of the instructor during MBDC program classes. Instructors will capture 
these events in the RED Cap database and follow -up as needed with CP participants.  
Page [ADDRESS_943297]. The primary feasibility progression criteria will be assessed using the previous ly described measures of feasibility, acceptability, and 
fidelity. For the progression criteria to be met with no modifications, we will require 
>75% participants attend (or watch video makeup) for at least 6 of 9 sessions. If that number is between 50% and 75%, we would recommend the study progress, ho wever we 
will make modifications to increase adherence. We also define  progression criteria based 
on the diversity of recruitment within the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. If our participants are not representative of the PWLD population’s racial and ethnic demographics within each care system, we will recommend changes to the recruitment strategy to encourage a higher enrollment rate of CPs who represent these populations. If progression criteria are met, s econdary 
feasibility measures including the completeness  of the clinical outcomes will be used to 
help direct data collection approach in future trials.   The efficacy hypothes is is that participation in the MBDC course programming will 
reduce depressive symptoms and burden while increasing self -compassion and 
mindfulness in CPs for PLWD. These outcomes will be measured using the following assessments:  
Page 21 of 32 
  
Clinical Outcome Scales for Efficacy:  
 
Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CES -D): The Center for 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_445312] -reported symptoms associated 
with depression. It has been validated for dementia and multiple other diagnoses, and it is 
sensitive to differences between caregivers and non -caregivers .27 The 10-item version has 
been shown to retain the reliability and validity of the original 20-item scale in the elderly population.
28  
 Zarit Burden Inventory: The Zarit Burden Inventory is an interview that evaluates 
caregiver burden through a self -report measure. The survey scores are positively 
correlated with behavior problems in older adults and depression scores of caregivers .
29 
The shorten version of this scale, the ZBI -6, demonstrated comparable discriminative and 
internal consistency as the original 12-item versions .30 
 
Clinical Outcomes for Behavior Change   
 
The State Self -Compassion Scale Short Form: To evaluate self -compassion, participants 
indicated how often they acted in the manner stated in each of the items on a scare of 1 
(almost never) to 5 (almost always). The survey evaluates self -kindness verses self -
judgement, common humanity verses isolation, and mindfulness versus over -
identification31.  
 Mindful Attention Awareness Scale: This 5 -item scale asks participations to indicate at 
what level they relate to specific experiences, aimed at measuring main characteristics of 
mindfulness .
25 Higher scores represented elevated levels of mindfulness expression.  
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
Sample size rationale: The sample size is largely determined by [CONTACT_695272][INVESTIGATOR_695247]. We plan to enroll up to 130 in MBDC courses offered 
during the study timeframe ( up to 15 CP/course). While this pi[INVESTIGATOR_695248], we estimate that a sample size of [ADDRESS_943298] 
correlation of scores within course sess ion (ICC = .10) and CES -D-[ADDRESS_943299] 
deviation of 4, with 80% power and a two-sided alpha of 0.05. The results from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_695249] -calculations for a large ePCT speci fically to provide 
an estimate of the ICC associated with course cluster as this parameter is key in 
determining a study’s power a -priori. Table 2 provides estimates of the current study’s 
expected effect size with a range of assumptions for ICC value (0 to 0 .3) and average 
CES-D-10 scores for the control period (10 to 15) , as well as estimates for a hypothetical 
ePCT with a sample size of 450 (30 courses, 15 per course) maintaining at least 80% 
power.

9.2.1 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
At the time of MBDC enrollment (registration on the Presence Care site), a CP will 
be presented with several currently enrolling class options (multiple days/times of 
week) and asked to select two that work with their schedule. Approximately 4 weeks 
prior to the course start date, they will then be randomly enrolled in one of the two 
selected courses, allowing for randomization on the class level while still accommodating the participant’s schedule. An adaptive randomization schematic will be used to adjust  the probability of class assignment based on CPs already enrolled in 
the trial. Since randomization is preferred  in the full-scale ePCT, it is important to 
assess the feasibility of the acceptability of the random assignment in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. Once a CP has registered for a MBDC course, there is variable delay period until there are enough people to fill the class. Duri ng this time, Presence Care will send regular 
emails updates to stay in contact. Once a class option is full, CPs will be notified,  and 
the class will start. If a CP situation or schedule has changed  and they decline the 
assigned course, they will have the option choose a preferred day and time so that we do not deny anyone access to this program . 
9.3 Interim analyses  and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_695250] a one -year pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. There are no statistical 
rules that would suspend MBDC program enrollment. The Safety Officer and NIA may decide to stop this study based upon review of data provided by [CONTACT_30165].
  
9.4 Outcomes  
9.4.1 Primary outcome   
To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of implementation of the MBDC program, primary outcomes will include: number of CP participants contact[CONTACT_260605], number of CP enrolled, missingness in the class registration materials, 
response rate to the four questionnaires, completeness of the administrative generated 
data, CP att endance and module completion rates.  
9.4.2 Secondary outcomes   
To determine the feasibility of obtaining clinical outcome measures , secondary 
outcomes will include response rates and completeness of data for CED -D-10 and 
ZBI-6. To explore the feasibility of obtaining online consent for research access to CP 
Page 23 of 32 
 healthcare utilization records , exploratory outcomes will include the number of CPs  
who agree and consent to research access included on Questionnaire 3 .  
9.5 Data Analyses  
Aim 1 - Primary Feasibly Analysis : To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity 
of implementation of the MBDC program we will beginning by [CONTACT_695273] s contact[CONTACT_695274]. The total number of mailed flyers will be counted.  Adding 
documentation of flyer distribution to the current clinic workflow  is too large of a barrier 
for this pragmatic trial. An estimate of flyers distributed in the clinics will made by 
[CONTACT_695275].  These will be used to calculate 
the overall rate of program registration as well as broken down by [CONTACT_695276]. The 
feasibility of collecting patient provided data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_695277]. The completeness of the administrative generated data, including date of 
enrollment, course section, and attendance, will also be quantified. Fidelity of the 
intervention will be assessed by [CONTACT_695278]. Completion patterns will be summarized overall and 
stratified by [CONTACT_695279]. The fidelity of the make -up video 
module offerings as a substitute for in -class participation will be evaluated by [CONTACT_695280]-class and those who 
utilized the make -up modules. Any differences in intervention fidelity associated wit h CP 
demographics will be described and discussed. Table [ADDRESS_943302] that 60% of participants will have at least 3 -months to reply to 
these additional questionnaires before the final analytic data is aggregated.

Aim 2 - Secondary Feasibility and Efficacy Analyses : The completeness of the CED -
D-10 and ZBI -6 outcomes will be quantified by [CONTACT_695281] (CES -D-10: 10 items, ZBI -6: 6 items) at each assessment. The 
rate of completion for both scales will be presented overall and stratified by 
[CONTACT_63496], site, and by [CONTACT_695282]. As the current study design results in a non-
uniform length of the control period, the weeks between Q1 and Q2 will be recorded and 
summarized for the sample to better understand how the design could scale to a larger 
ePCT. A preliminary efficacy analysis will utilize the total scores for the CES -D-10 
(range: 0 to 30) and ZBI -6 (range: 0 to 24) calculated for all completed questionnaires. 
Both outcomes will be summarized at each questionnaire timepoint using means and/or 
medians, as appropriate. Change over the control (Q2-Q1) and intervention (Q3-Q2) 
periods will be calculated for each CP and summarized for the sample. Descriptive 
summaries will be provided for r esponses from CP who complete the 3 -month follow -up 
questionnaire (Q4) within the 12-month study timeframe and before the final analytic dataset is defined . These responses will not be used in any of the formal inferential 
analyses.  
 
Analysis will utilize linear mixed -models with random effects to account for clustering of 
data within MBDC course section as well as repeated measures within CPs to estimate 
the intervention effect on depressive symptoms and care -giver burden (Equation 1) . In a 
scaled up ePCT, we expect the unit of randomization to continue to be course section,  
which is reflected in our choice of random effects. The model structure will be based on a 
standard ANCOVA used to evaluate change that adjusts for the pre -interve ntion 
measurement of the outcome variable with the post -intervention measurement as the 
model outcome. Each CP will contribute a pair of data points for the control period (Pre: 
Q1, Post: Q2) and intervention period (Pre: Q2, Post: Q3) which requires our r andom 
effects structure to account for repeated measurements within CPs. If there is no 
difference in change in efficacy outcomes, we expect Q2 -Q1 = Q3 -Q2. Each model will 
include covariates to adjust for possible confounding associated with CP demographic s 
and CP history (age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic measures, and length of caregiving). 
While the relative time of measurement is considered (pre/post) our analysis does not 
adjust for time over the course of the study , as we hypothesize any treatment effect would 
be time -agnostic within the year -long pi[INVESTIGATOR_695251]. When an ePCT with a 
longer timeline is considered, this assumption will have to be revisited. A brief assessment of self -compassion and mindfulness scales outcomes will be performed u sing 
the responses collected from the “research  only” section of the questionnaires. These 
results will help better understand the possible mechanisms between the intervention and 
clinical outcome for future ePCTs. These items will be removed at the conclusion of the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_695252]. All analysis will be performed in SAS 9.4 and 
significance determined using a two -sided alpha of 0.05.

10.3.2  Quality Control Committee  
Not applicable.  
10.3.3  Metrics  
Metrics for quality control include the following:  
• Number of protocol deviations  
• Number of data entry errors  
• Number of technological issues with survey distribution   
10.3.[ADDRESS_943304] access study data  for the 
purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456]/funding agency, and inspection by 
[CONTACT_3482].  
[ADDRESS_943305] a waiver of informed consent for all aspects of this study, to include the use of electronic medical records for recruitment purposes, randomization assignment, enrollment and participation in the MDBC program, and the use of the collected progr am 
data.  We offer the following justifications for the waiver of informed consent:  
1. the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects ; 
Page [ADDRESS_943306] 
provided overwhelmingly positive feedback about the program and its life -changing 
lessons (Figure 3). There have been no reported adverse events related to participation in MBDC.  The randomization  component  is minimal risk  as well , 
particularly since the  CP will be given the option to choose their preferred day and 
time if they decline the randomly assigned MBDC course.  We are assessing the 
feasibility of randomization and do not want to withhold the MBDC program from 
those for whom this is not feasible.   Use of the administrative data will be governed 
by a data use agreement.
 
2. The research could not practicably be carried out without the requested waiver;  
The main purpose of this study is t o assess the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity 
of implementation of the Mindfulness Based Dementia Care (MBDC) program in 
practice.  Participation is voluntary and participants can drop out at any time and are free to skip any questions during the data collection process.  The centralized 
registration and administrative data collection process described herein is being 
created as a permanent part of MBDC  through the Presence Care website. It would 
not be practicable to add research informed consent to this process as there is a 
possibility that the knowledge of being in a research study, or the burden of having to 
fill out extra paperwork would bias the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of 
implementation that we are hopi[INVESTIGATOR_695253].  
3. If the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable 
biospecimens, the research could not practicably be carried out without using such 
information or biospecimens in an identifiable format;    
We require identifiable information for recruitment purposes.  We could not mail 
without access to this identifiable information. Access to the administrative data from Presence Care will be governed by a data use agreement  
4. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the 
subjects;  
While we are requesting a waiver of informed consent for research purposes, participation in the program is completely voluntary, as is answering any of the 
questions in the data collection activities.  Participants can stop the program at any 
time.  We include a statement as part of the administrative data set questionnaires 
that: 1) answering questions is voluntary; 2) their answers may be shared in a de -
Page [ADDRESS_943307] with researchers. A “yield” approach for empty data field s will be used 
in the survey software that triggers an alert asking for, but not requiring the 
completion of data elements  
5.  Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent 
information after participation  
Information about the MBDC program is already present in each site’s memory clinic 
newsletters and/or in  notices in clinic common areas. We plan to invite patients, CPs, 
and families to a virtual, community presentation of the results of the study.  
Finally, please note that we do not consider the stakeholder interviews mentioned in Table [ADDRESS_943308] a partial HIPAA waiver of authorization for the use of HealthPartners EHR data 
for eligibility and recruitment purposes.  We offer the following justifications for the partial 
HIPAA waiver : 
1) Use or disclosure involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of 
individuals because of the presence of at least the following elements:  
i) An adequate plan to protect health information identifiers from improper  
use or  disclosure,  
The HealthPartners programmer will extract PHI  data from the EHR and 
store on a secure server in a project folder that requires individual username 
[CONTACT_695286]. ;p]  
ii) An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity absent a 
health or research justification or legal requirement to retain them,  and 
Identifiers will be destroyed after recruitment is complete.  To ensure that 
we do not duplicate mailings to patients, we need to retain identifiers until 
recruitment is complete , and cannot destroy sooner . 
iii) Adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be used or disclosed to a 
third party except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the 
research study, or for other research uses and disclosures permitted by [CONTACT_695283] a third party except as required by [CONTACT_2371]. 
Section 11.3 provides more detail.  
2) Research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration;  and 
Page 29 of 32 
 HealthPartners research staff will be contact[CONTACT_695284], potential subjects will not be available to sign a 
HIPAA Authorization.  
3) Research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of  PHI.  
We require PHI information for recruitment purposes. We could not mail without access 
to this identifiable information.  
11.[ADDRESS_943309] risk of breach of confidentiality, we will use REDCap, which  is a 
secure web -based system used for data collection and is compliant with federal 
regulations (21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, HIPAA, and GDPR).  
To protect patient privacy, recruitment letters will be addressed to patients and mailed to 
the patient address. In case a patient may not be aware of a dementia diagnosis or not 
remember it, we will use sensitive language such as “information about a prog ram of 
potential interest” and avoid statements that could cause alarm.  
Information will not be released without written permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the sponsor or persons working on behalf of the sponsor (i.e. IMPACT research study staff, the DSMB and/or Safety Officer), the FDA, 
the NIA, and the  OHRP . 
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be d iscontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], the NIA, the OHRP, the FDA, or 
other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are 
protected.  
12 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This study will be approved by a central IRB and conducted in accordance with the  
Belmont Report and the  Declaration of Helsinki.

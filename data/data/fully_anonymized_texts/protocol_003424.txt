Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   8 of 98 1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUN D 
 
1.1 Introduction 
 
50,000 new cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) are diagnosed in 
the [LOCATION_003] each year1. Most patient s present with locally advanced disease and are treated 
with definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). We, and others, have 
investigated the addition of induction chemotherapy (IC) to complement CRT particularly in patients with bulky disease.  
 TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin and 5- FU) emerged as the standard IC regimen after it was 
compared to PF and shown to be superior  (TAX- 323 and TAX -324 trials )
2,3,4 as shown:   
 
 
   
 
 

Version 3/25/2020: Amendment [ADDRESS_1268998] similar benefit to docetaxel5.  
 
However, the relapse rate (RR) after TPF and CRT was 56%  in the TAX -324 trial3,4 and 
24% in the Paradigm trial6. A complete response ( CR) at the primary tumor site  (PTS)  
following two  cycles of IC  is a surro gate prognostic marker for favorable survival free of 
disease recurrence following subsequent definitive RT -based therapy7,8. The  likelihood of 
CR at the PTS  after two cycles of TPF was only 14%9. The risk of grade 3- 4 adverse events 
(AEs) with TPF was high ( 83% )6. These data establish three important endpoints (RR, PTS 
CR rate, and grade 3 -4 AEs) that future clinical trials of IC s hould improve upon.    
 
1.2 Rationale for  Adding  Nab -Paclitaxel to IC  in HNSCC  
 
Improved antitumor activity and increased intratumoral paclitaxel accumulation occurred with nanoparticle albumin -bound paclitaxel ( nab-paclitaxel) compared to cremophor -
based paclitaxel in nude mice bearing several human tumor xenografts
10.  In contrast to 
cremophor -based paclitaxel, nab- paclitaxel resulted in higher tumor response rates in 
breast cancer11. The improved efficacy may be i n part due to the high tumor expression of 
Secreted Protein Acidic and R ich in C ysteine (SPARC), a protein that plays a role in 
albumin receptor -mediated endothelial transport12,13.  
 
 

Version 3/25/2020: Amendment [ADDRESS_1268999] activation occurs in the 
majority (67%) of HNSCC19-25. Based on these data, nab- paclitaxel may be a more 
effective anti -tumor agent than cremophor -based paclitaxel in the treatment of HNSCC.   
 
1.3 APF -C as Induction Chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_904319] a recent phase II trial performed at Washington University and supported by [CONTACT_27718] (protocol # ABX218/HRPO# 08-0911), we assessed the feasibility and efficacy of a novel 
induction chemotherapy regimen of nab- paclitaxel, cisp latin, 5-FU + cetuximab ( APF-C) 
given to patients with locally advanced HNSCC who were subsequently treated with definitive CRT
26Thirty patients were enrolled over 1 2 months. The schema for the AP F-C 
regimen is shown below : 
   
 
 
*SD = Stable Disease; PD = Progressive Disease.  The protocol permitted resection followed by [CONTACT_904320] (C)RT in these patients; however, no primary resections were performed because CR or PR occurred 
in all patients following ACCF.

Version 3/25/2020: Amendment [ADDRESS_1269000] patients had bulky  primary tumor and nodal disease (74% T3 or T4 and 79% >  N2b). 
By [CONTACT_12148], 53%  of patients a chieved CR at the PTS following 2 cycles of 
APF-C as shown:  
 
 
The risk of serious adverse events (grades 3 -4) during APF -C was 39% . The relapse rate 
with APF -C followed by [CONTACT_904321] 13% , with a median follow -up of 49 months  
(range: 30 -65). 
 
We then compared the outcomes of the 30 patients treated on the AP F+C protocol with a 
similar historical control group of 38 patients treated at our institution with TPF + 
cetuximab as induction chemothe rapy followed by [CONTACT_904322] e CRT. APF -C was superior to 
TPF-C overall (2 yr DSS 96.7% vs 77.6%, respectively, p=0.004) and in both p16 positive 
OPSCC and p16 negative HNSCC27, as shown:

Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   13 of 98  
 
1.4 ACF  as Induction Chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_904323] t o TPF, APF -C included two therapeutic changes: nab- paclitaxel was 
substituted for docetaxel and cet uximab was added. The second generation of this novel IC 
regimen eliminate d cetuximab from the AP F-C regimen to isolate the treatment effects of 
nab-paclitaxel when given with cisplatin and 5 -FU (APF)28. APF (protocol #  AX-HN-PI-
0005/HRPO#201202113) was an institutional trial supported by [CONTACT_27718].  
  
APF was developed to explore the effect of removing cetuximab on efficacy  and to reduce 
the risk of gra de 3-4 AEs (39% during APF -C). Cetuximab was deleted from the APF -C 
regimen since its benefit during IC was unclear. The schema for APF followed by [CONTACT_904324]:  

Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   14 of 98  
The results of the APF trial were compared to the APF -C trial. Unexpectedly, we found 
that APF was more effective than APF -C as judged by [CONTACT_904325]: 77%  with APF 
and 53% with APF -C. PTS CR rates were higher with APF even when stratified for T 
classification  and p16 status. Relapse rate with APF was only 3% ; however, median 
follow -up was early  (11 [6- 21] months ).   
 
Why would APF be superior to APF -C in HNSCC ? EGFR is overexpressed in nearly all 
HNSCC. Macropi[INVESTIGATOR_103009], the process whereby [CONTACT_904326], is increased by  [CONTACT_904327]. Cetuximab, an EGFR inhibitor, may down 
regulate macropi[INVESTIGATOR_103009], which could decrease t umor cell uptake of nab-paclitaxel. 
Cetuximab also reduces the fraction of tumor cells in “S” phase, during which tumor cells 
are particularly vulnerable to taxanes.  
 Although APF may be more effective than APF -C, the risk of grade 3- 4 AEs during APF 
was 40%.

Version 3/25/2020: Amendment [ADDRESS_1269001] with APF. However, grade 3- 4 AEs during IC remain disturbingly 
high (40%) even with APF. Given the extraordinarily high efficacy of APF, our next 
generation of nab- paclitaxel IC regimens will explore reducing the rate of grade 3 -4 AEs 
by [CONTACT_904328] 5 -FU (AP: nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin) and then deleting cisp latin 
(A: nab- paclitaxel alone).  
 
1.6   “The APA Trial”   
 
We hypothesize that nab -paclitaxel is the most effective and least toxic agent in the APF 
regimen. The efficacy of [ADDRESS_1269002] effective agent in the 
treatment of HNSCC, resulted in a 27% risk of renal AEs during APF. Cisplatin will be a component of Arm 1 but not Arm 2 of the APA trial. Arm 1 will include patients with  good 
performance status and vital organ function. Arm 2 will include patients with poorer performance status and vital organ function.  
 In this trial, our objectives are to determine the efficacy and toxicity of IC with nab-paclitaxel + cisplatin (Arm 1: AP) and with nab- paclitaxel (Arm 2: A) alone in patients 
with HNSCC, and to compare these data to APF. We also hypothesize that the high anti -
tumor efficacy of nab -paclitaxel in HNSCC is due to the upregulation of m acropi[INVESTIGATOR_103009], 
a result of the frequent  presence of Ras and PI3K (and EGFR) activation in this cancer.  

Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   16 of 98  
The following highlights the key elements of the APA trial: 
• Two arm, open label, phase II trial of induction chemotherapy with either nab-
paclitaxel and cisplatin ( Arm 1: AP) or nab- paclitaxel alone ( Arm 2: A) followed 
by [CONTACT_904329].  
• ARM 1 -  AP 
o Six weeks of nab -paclitaxel (100 mg/m2/week) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2 
days 1 and 22) followed by [CONTACT_904330] (PTS) assessment (by [CONTACT_904331], biopsy  
o CT Neck and FDG -PET/CT)  
o If CR/PR, three more weeks of nab -paclitaxel and cisplatin followed by 
[CONTACT_349643]  
o If <PR, move directly to CRT i f not surgical candidates. 
o CRT includes high dose bolus (100 mg/m
2 x 3) cisplatin and IMRT  
• ARM 2 – A  
o Six weeks of nab -paclitaxel (100 mg/m2/week) followed by [CONTACT_904332] (PTS) assessment (by [CONTACT_904331], biopsy, CT Neck and FDG -PET/CT)  
o If CR/PR, three more weeks of nab- paclitaxel followed by [CONTACT_349643]  
o If <PR, move directly to CRT if not surgical candidates. 
o CRT includes cetuximab (400 mg/m2 x 1 then  250 mg/m2 x 7) and IMRT  
• Primary efficacy endpoint of CR rate at the PTS with the objective to have each 
arm non- inferior to the PTS CR rate with APF (77%)  
• Secondary adverse events (Grade 3 -4) endpoint  
o Arm [ADDRESS_1269003] 25% lower than the risk of Grade 3 -4 AE’s during APF  (40% 
decreased to 30%).  
o Arm [ADDRESS_1269004] 50% lower than the risk of Grade 3 -4 AE’s during APF (40% 
decreased to 20%).  
 
1.7 Amendment to Add Arm 3:  
 
1.7.[ADDRESS_1269005] a favorable prognosis with AP + 
CRT. However, these patients experience a high rate of serious acute toxicity, 
mainly mucositis, during and after CRT. In Arm 3, treatment will include  AP as 
induction chemotherapy followed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] -escalated  CRT . Our primary hypothesis is 
that de -escalated CRT will reduce the median percent weight loss (a quantifiable 
surrogate of mucositis) by 50% compared to what occurred with full dose CRT in patients treated on Arm 1 of this protocol.  
 
1.7.2 Rationale  for Arm 3  
 
Our preliminary analysis of Arm 1 (AP + CRT; n=28 patients) showed preservation 
of all key efficacy endpoints: the CR rate at the PTS after 2 cycles of AP was 70.4% and the relapse rate was 3.6%. These data compare favorably to our historical 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   17 of 98 experience with APF followed by [CONTACT_904333] 77% and the relapse rate was 3%. However, 64% of patients 
on Arm [ADDRESS_1269006] troublesome AE during CRT, r esulting in a median weight loss of 13.1% 
(95%CI: 5% -  23.2%).   
 
Given the significant rate of grades 3 -4 AEs during CRT, along with the very low 
rate of relapse, further refinement of AP + CRT is indicated to reduce the AE burden and maintain the low rel apse rate. De- escalation of radiation is a strategy 
likely to lower the AE risk of AP + CRT.  
In this amendment, we retain the AP + CRT backbone but de -escalate the 
dose of RT from 70 Gy to 42 Gy. We also plan to administer one dose (vs three) 
of cisplatin during RT. With these  modifications, we hypothesize : a 50% 
decrease in the median percent weight loss during CRT. This novel treatment 
approach will be evaluated in patients with HPV -related OPSCC  (Arm 3) , a 
sub-group with a very favorable prognosis . 
 
1.7.3 Unique Feature of Arm 3  
 
Several ongoing trials are evaluating de -escalation of RT. The common theme of 
the non- surgical de- escalation trials is the use of RT doses >  54 Gy. Another theme 
of these tri als is restriction of this approach to HPV -related OPSCC, and only those 
patients with low risk disease (limited smoking history and not T4 or N2c/3 disease). In this amendment, we will distinguish our de -escalation approach from 
these trials by [CONTACT_2329] a mu ch lower dose of RT (42 Gy) and including all patients 
with HPV- related OPSCC (Arm 3).  
 
1.7.[ADDRESS_1269007] of care treatment for anal canal SCC. Surgery is only used as salvage 
therapy for LRR after CRT.  The treatment plan for T2N0 disease is 42 Gy elective 
nodal and 50.4 Gy anal tumor planning target volumes (PTV) in 28 fractions and for T3 -4N0-3 disease is 45 Gy elective nodal, 50.4 Gy for <  3 cm or 54 Gy for > [ADDRESS_1269008] to anal 
SCC, the dose of RT given is 70 Gy. Also, in anal SCC the planned cumulative dose of cisplatin given during CRT is 140 mg/m
2; whereas, in HNSCC the 
cumulative dose of cisplatin is much higher (300 mg/m2). These data suggest that 
the doses of CRT given for HPV -related OPSCC may be more than needed to 
cure this cancer.   
 
The most i mportant message from the studies of CRT in anal SCC is a  
radiation dose of only [ADDRESS_1269009] this 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   18 of 98 hypothesis  is in patients  with HNSCC  who undergo inducti on chemotherapy to 
reduce disease volume before applying de -escalated RT . In our amendment, we 
hypothesize the use of induction chemotherapy (AP) will permit reduction of RT 
to 42 Gy  
 There is precedent for using induction chemotherapy as a platform to de -escalate 
RT. ECOG 1308 used the strategy of induction chemotherapy (cisplatin, paclitaxel and cetuximab) followed by 54Gy of RT (with cetuximab) and found excellent results ( 2-year PFS and OS rates were 80% and 94%, respectively) and lower rates 
of swallo wing difficulties
30.  
 
1.7.5 Expected Reduction of Toxicity  by [CONTACT_264368]-escalation of RT Dose from 70 
Gy to 42 Gy  
 
The Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) study
[ADDRESS_1269010] understanding of organ specific 
dose/volume/outcome data. Based on QUANTEC, reduc tion of the RT  dose 
from 70 Gy to 42 Gy would substantially decrease the toxicity burden. The 
organs related to swallowing function include the pharyngea l constrictors, larynx, 
and esophagus.  For the pharyngeal constrictors, a mean radiation dose of less than 50 Gy reduces the risk of symptomatic dysphagia and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_904291] 100% (with 70 Gy) to less than 20%.  For the larynx, a mean dose of < 50 Gy redu ces the risk 
of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_904291] 100% to less than 30%, and the risk of laryngeal edema is less than 20% with a mean dose of less than 44 Gy.  For the esophagus, if the volume receiving 50 Gy is less than 40%, the risk of grade 2 or above toxicity is no mor e 
than 30%.  It is important to understand that the normal tissue complication probability ( NTCP ) with RT dose curve i s exponential  in shape , meaning that a 
dose of [ADDRESS_1269011] dose for HNSCC in the 
non-operative setting.  
 
1.7.6 Hypotheses of the Amendment  
 
1. De-escalation of RT from 70 Gy (our current standard in Arms 1 and 2 of the 
APA protocol) to 42 Gy and reduction of the number of doses of cispla tin given 
during RT from three to one will result in a significant decrease in acute toxicity of CRT, measured by [CONTACT_904334].  
 
2. The relapse risk of this overall therapy will not exceed 25% in Arm 3.

laryngoscopy  (or former location of primary tumor if tumor is no longer visible ). If 
a biopsy is not feasible for financial reasons or safety concerns, at the Primary 
Investigator’s discretion, the biopsy may be forgone.
  
 
Arms 1 and 2:  If disease response  shows CR or P R at the primary tumor site (by [CONTACT_904347] ) and does not show  radiographic (CT) or 
FDG -PET/CT evidence of disease progression, s/he may initiate Cycle 3 of induction, 
followed immediately by [CONTACT_904348]  (See Section 
5.9.1 and 5.9.2) . If the patient shows SD or PD, or if the patient experiences  an 
unacceptable toxicity unlikely to resolve in the face of a reasonable dose delay (at the discretion of the Primary Investigator)  s/he should receive definitive radiation and 
concurrent chemotherapy  if not a surgical candidate.  If the patient is a surgical candidate, 
they will receive surgery followed by [CONTACT_349643]  (See Section 5.9.1 and 5.9.2) .  
 
Arm 3 : If disease response shows CR or PR at the primary tumor site (by [CONTACT_904349]) and does not show  radiographic (CT) or 
FDG -PET/CT evidence of disease progression, s/he may initiate Cycle 3 of induction, 
followed immediately by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] -intensified radiation (42Gy) and one dose of cisplatin or 6 
doses of cetuximab (see section 5.9.3 or 5.9.4) . Patients w ith SD or PD  after 2 cycles of 
AP will either 1) undergo surgery (if a surgical candidate) followed by [CONTACT_904350] 42 Gy 
RT and abbreviated cisplatin or cetuximab (see section 5.9.3 or 5.9.4) or 2)  if not a surgical 
candidate, the patient will be treated with standard definitive radiation ( 70Gy ) and  3 cycles 
of Cisplatin or 8 doses of Cetuximab (See Section 5.9.1 and 5.9.2) .

100 mg IVPB, and albuterol inhalation (2.5 mg by [CONTACT_703155])  
prior to each dose of cetuximab.  
2. Cetuximab will be started 7 days (+/ - 3 days) before starting definitive 
radiation therapy to the head and neck. The initial (loading) dose of 
cetuximab will be 400 mg/m2 IVPB .  The  recommended process for 
administering the loading dose is to give a  test dose of 100 mg for one hour, 
followed by [CONTACT_904351], followed by [CONTACT_91959] t he remainder of 
the dose over 2 hours , followed by [CONTACT_904352]. Do not give

5.10 Definitive Radiation Therapy (Arms 1 and 2 Only)  
 
Prior to starting radiation therapy and at the last week of radiation therapy, the patient will be asked to complete QOL questionnaire.  
 
5.10.1 Overview  
 
It is strongly recommended that radiation therapy begin within 2 1 to 42 days  (and 
no later than 56 days)  after the start of Cycle 3 .  Intensity modulated radiation 
therapy ( IMRT ) is to be used exclusively for this study. Definitive IMRT  will be 
delivered once per day Monday through Friday per routine clinical practice using. The total dose to the gross disease will be [ADDRESS_1269037] Simulation  
 
As per routine  practice, computed tomography (CT) will be the primary image 
platform for targeting and treatment planning.  Prior to the scan, the patient will be given IV contrast according to institutional protocols ( provided the patient has 
normal ren al function and no allergies to contrast ).   The patient will be positioned 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment [ADDRESS_1269038] simulator table (head toward the gantry). The head will be placed 
on a clear plastic headrest so as to have the neck slightly extended.  Alternatively, a custom head/shoulder mold may be used for immobilization. An immobilization mask will then be fashioned. A CT dataset will be acquired from the top of the head through 5 cm below the clavicular heads with no more than 5 mm axial slices.  Three localization marks will be drawn and wired on the patient’s immobilization mask at the angle of the mandible bilaterally and midline. These marks will serve to establish an internal reference from which an isocenter is placed midline, midplane, at the level of the angle of the  mandible.   If a CT simulation scan was 
performed prior to induction therapy, a repeat CT simulation scan will be performed in the same immobilization device after induction therapy and electronic fusion of the images will be performed.  
 
5.10.[ADDRESS_1269039] scan will be exported to a commercially available virtual simulation software package.  Guidelines for clinical treatment volumes to be contoured for each head and neck sub -site along with current institutional treatment guidelines 
are shown in Appendix 3.  Guidelines for delineating each lymph node level will 
be based on the international consensus for delineation of head and neck lymph nodes ( http://www.rtog.org/hnatlas/main.html
; reproduced in Appendix 3). These 
guidelines were derived in part from W ashington University School of M edicine 
institutional data, and are consistent with routine clinical practice at Washington University .   
 An example case of a T3N2BM0, stage IVA tonsil cancer is outlined in the table below.  Current treatment guidelines for this case including dose levels are represented with CTV1, CTV2, and CTV3.   
CTV1  CTV2  (Optional)  CTV3

Dose 70 Gy/35 fx  Dose 63 Gy/35 fx  Dose 56 Gy/35 fx  
Key: GTVp = GTV primary tumor; GTVn = GTV nodal tumor; IN = ipsilateral neck; CN = 
contralateral neck; roman numbers relate to the level system of naming lymph node regions; BRPLN = bilateral retropharyngeal lymph nodes).  
 
Normal structure and treatment volume contours will be delineated in a man ner 
consistent with routine clinical practice. Refer to appendix 4 for specific guidelines.  
 
5.10.4 IMRT Optimization  
 
The image and contour data will be exported to the TomoTherapy Hi Art System 
(TomoTherapy Inc., Madison WI), where treatment planning and IMRT optimization will be performed. For patients being treated on a Varian System 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   35 of 98 (Varian Medical Systems, Inc.), treatment planning will be completed on a 
compatible platform (i.e. Varian’s Eclipse Treatment Planning System, or the ADAC Pi[INVESTIGATOR_904292]).  
 
5.10.5 Treatment Field Arrangement  
 
With tomotherapy, a continuous helical treatment field is used with dynamic multileaf collimator fluence modulation.  The system calculates the optimized collimator leaf delivery pattern (treatment sinogram) that most closely approximates the prescribed constraints.  Planned dose deposition is calculated using a collapsed -cone convolution superposition technique that addresses three -
dimensional scatter and inhomogeneities.  The Varian System employs up to ten co -planar fields with static or dynamic 
multileaf collimation. As with tomotherapy, the treatment planning system calculates the optimized collimator leaf delivery pattern that most closely approximates the prescribed constraints and prescription goals.  
 
5.10.6 Dose, Energy and Prescription Parameters  
 
External beam radiation with 6 MV photons will be delivered in 200 cGy dail y 
fractions (Monday through Friday), 35 fractions over 7 weeks to a total dose of 7000 cGy.  
   
Prescription Coverage Goals  
99% of clinical treatment volumes should receive at least 93% of the respective prescription dose (i.e. 99% of PTV 7000 should be covered by 6510 cGy; 99% of PTV 6300 covered by 5859 cGy; and 99% of PTV 5600 covered by 5208 cGy).  
 No more than 5% of the volume “Skin” should receive more than the prescription dose (70 Gy) and hotspots must be within the PTV.    Photons with energy of 6 M V will be utilized for IMRT on the helical tomotherapy 
and Trilogy units.

Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   37 of 98 5.10.9 Daily Radiation Treatment  
 
Patients will receive external beam radiation treatment delivered either by [CONTACT_904355]™ System once a day, five days a week , for 7 weeks 
as per routine clinical practice.  
 
5.10.10 Quality Assurance  
 Treatment plan physics review and QA are required for each patient in accordance with current institutional standards for IMRT.  Daily set -up error will be minimized by [CONTACT_904356]: immobilization mask, standard skin/mask alignment marks, and daily on -board imaging.  
 Per routine practice, daily megavoltage he lical CT scans will be acquired on the 
tomotherapy unit and compared with planning CT overlay.  
 For patients treated on the Trilogy
™ System, daily orthogonal port films or cone 
beam CT images will be aligned with the digitally reconstructed radiographs or 3D CT data set from the planning CT scan based on bony anatomy.  
 These setup scans will be performed immediately prior to each treatment and the appropriate shifts will be made at that time.

microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by [CONTACT_374121]. This stability results in the  inhibition of the normal dynamic 
reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for  vital inter phase and 
mitotic cellular functions. Paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles”  of 
microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during 
mitosis.  
 
6.1.3 Supplier  
 
nab-Paclitaxel  will be distributed by [CONTACT_904361].  Labels will bear Celgene’s name [CONTACT_3816], the protocol number, product name, dosage form and strength, medication identification/kit number, lot number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695], dosing instructions, storage conditions, the quantity of IP contained, and require education statements 
and/or regulatory statements as applicable.  No supplies will be shipped to any site until regulatory approval has been obtained.  Investigational sites will be supplied with nab-Paclitaxel  upon identification and screening of a potential trial subject.  
Upon identification of a potential subject, sites must fax a completed Drug Request Form to Celgene Corporation.  Allow at least [ADDRESS_1269053] Form to Celgene 
Corporation at 908- 673-2779. 
 
6.1.4 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
nab-Paclitaxel  is supplied as a white to off -white sterile lyophilized powder for  
reconstitution with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride.  Each single -use 50 mL vial 
will contain paclitaxel (100 mg) and approximately 900 mg human albumin (HA) as a stabilizer. Each vial will be labeled according to country -specific regulatory 
requirements fo r labeling of investigational products.   
 
1. Calculate the patient’s body surface area at the beginning of the study and if the weight changes by > 10%.  
2. Calculate the total dose (in mg) to be administered by  [CONTACT_904362].   
3. Calculate the total number of vials required by  [CONTACT_904363] 
100 (as there are 100 mg per vial) and rounding up to the next higher whole number .   
4. Using sterile technique, prepare the vials for reconstitution.  
5. Swab the rubber stoppers with alcohol.  
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   45 of 98 6. Recon stitute each nab- Paclitaxel vial by [CONTACT_44579] 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP or equivalent into each vial over a period of not 
less than [ADDRESS_1269054] the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP solution directly onto the lyophilized c ake as this will result in 
foaming. Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 (five) minutes to ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized cake/powder.   Gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete dissolution of any cake/powder occurs.  Rapid agitation or 
shaking will result in foaming. If foaming or clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_4095], stand solution for at least [ADDRESS_1269055] total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml susp ension required for 
the patient by [CONTACT_904363] 5.  
8. The reconstituted sample should be milky and homogeneous without visible particulates.  If unsuspended powder is visible, the vial should be gently inverted again to ensure complete re -suspension prior to use.  
9. Once the exact volume of reconstituted nab- Paclitaxel  has been withdrawn 
from the vials, discard any excess solution left over in accordance with standard operating procedures.  
10. Further dilution is not necessary. Inject the calculated dosing volume of 
reconstituted nab-Paclitaxel  suspension into an empty sterile, standard PVC 
IV bag using an injection port.  Inject perpendicularly into the center of the injection port to avoid disl odging plastic material into the IV bag.    
11. Administer the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted Nab -Paclitaxel  
suspension by [CONTACT_12781] 30 minutes.  The use of in- line filters is not 
recommended .  
12. Following administration, the intravenous line s hould be flushed with 
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure complete administration of the complete dose, according to local practice.  
13. Use within 8 hours of reconstitution.  If not used immediately, store reconstituted nab- Paclita xel in a refrigerator for no longer than 8 hours.  
 
6.1.5 Storage and Stability  
 
Unreconstituted nab-Paclitaxel  should be stored at controlled room temperature 
(20° to 25°C or 68° to 77°F) in its carton.  Retain in the original package to protect from bright light. Unopened vials of albumin- bound paclitaxel are stable until the 
date indicated on the package when st ored at the above temperatures in the original 
package. Reconstituted albumin- bound paclitaxel should be used immediately, but 
may be refrigerated at 2
oC to 8oC (38oF to 46oF) for a maximum of [ADDRESS_1269056] any unused portion.  
 
6.1.6 nab- Paclitaxel  Drug Return and Destruction 
 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment [ADDRESS_1269057] be recorded on the site’s pharmacy drug accountability 
log: quantity of vials destroyed, expi[INVESTIGATOR_166404].  The pharmacist 
must document that the study drug was destroyed in accordance with their institution’s drug destruc tion policy or SOP.  A drug destruction memo and the 
site’s drug destruction SOP/policy should be sent to Celgene Medical Operations Dept.  A copy of the drug destruction memo should be retained at the clinical site.  In the event of study completion or te rmination, a copy of all pharmacy records 
(drug dispensing log, drug accountability log and any destruction memos) must be mailed to Celgene Medical
 Operations.  
 
6.1.7 nab- Paclitaxel  Premedication and Administration 
 
Patients do not require premedication prior to nab- Paclitaxel  administration, as 
hypers ensitivity reactions are rare.  In the unlikely event of a mild hypersensitivity 
reaction, premedication may be administered using the premedication regimen the institution typi[INVESTIGATOR_904294].  In the rare event of a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue nab- Paclitaxel .  However, it is recommended 
that patients receive Granisetron 1mg prior to receiving nab- Paclitaxel.  
 NOTE : It is not a r equirement to use filter needles in the preparation of, or in- line 
filters during the administration of nab- Paclitaxel . In any event, filters of pore -size 
less than [ADDRESS_1269058] not be used.   Albumin -bound paclitaxel should be administered by [CONTACT_204108] 30 minutes.  
 
6.2 Cisplatin  (CDDP, Platinol -AQ®)  
 
6.2.1 Cisplatin Description  
 
Molecular formula: PtCl2H6N2  
Molecular weight: 300.1. 
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1269059] likely mechanism of  antitumor action of this drug resides in its ability to 
inhibit DNA synthesis, and to a lesser degree, RNA and protein synthesis. It has also been shown that Cisplatin binds to DNA and produces inter -strand cross -links. 
Also cisplatin is not phase -sensiti ve and its cytotoxicity is similar in all phases of 
the cell cycle. Additional information can be found in the package insert.  
 
6.2.3 Supplier  
 
Cisplatin is commercially available as 1 mg/mL in both 50 mL multiple dose vial and 100 mL multiple dose vial. 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   47 of 98  
  
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   48 of 98 6.2.4 Dosa ge Form and Preparation  
 
The stability of cisplatin in solution is dependent upon the chloride ion concentration present in the diluent. Cisplatin should be diluted into an IV solution containing NaCL at a minimum chloride ion concentration of 0.040 mol/L (0.2% NaCL). Needles, syringes, catheters and IV administrations sets containing aluminum must be avoided during preparation and administration due to cisplatin-aluminum reaction causing precipi[INVESTIGATOR_904295]. Mannitol 12.5 to 25 gm may be adde d per institutional guidelines.  
 
6.2.5 Storage and Stability  
 
The dry, unopened vials should be stored at room temperature (15° - 25° C). The 
unopened container should be protected from light and stored in the carton until 
contents are used. Do not refrigerate. C isplatin remaining in the amber vial 
following initial entry is stable for [ADDRESS_1269060] be maintained during and after administration as described in the treatment section. It is recommended that a ll patients should be premedicated with 
antiemetics.  
 
6.3 Cetuximab (Erbitux)  – with Radiation ARM 2 and selected ARM 1  or 3  
patients  
 
6.3.1 Cetuximab Description  
 
Cetuximab is an anti -EGFR human- to-murine chimeric antibody.  
 
6.3.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
 
The epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR, HER1, c -ErbB -1) is a 
transmembrane  glycoprotein that is a member of a subfamily of type I receptor 
tyrosine kinases  including EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4. The EGFR is 
constitutively expressed in many  normal epi[INVESTIGATOR_27771], including the skin and 
hair follicle. Expression of  EGFR is also  detected in many human cancers including 
those of the head and neck, colon, and rectum.  
 
Cetuximab binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumor cells, and competitively inhibits the binding of epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF) and othe r 
ligands, such as transforming growth factor -alpha. In vitro assays and in vivo 
animal studies  have shown that binding of cetuximab to the EGFR blocks 
phosphorylation and activation of receptor -associated kinases, resulting in 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   49 of 98 inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and decreased matrix 
metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor production. Signal 
transduction through the EGFR results in activation of wild- type KRAS protein. 
However, in cells with activating KRAS somatic mutations , the mutant  KRAS 
protein is continuously active and appears independent of EGFR regulation. 
 In vitro , cetuximab can mediate antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
against  certain human tumor types. In vitro assays and in vivo animal studies have  
shown that  cetuximab inhibits the growth and survival of tumor cells that express 
the EGFR. No antitumor  effects of cetuximab were observed in human tumor 
xenografts lacking EGFR  expression. The addition of cetuximab to radiation 
therapy or irinotecan in human tumor  xenograft models in mice resulted in an 
increase in anti -tumor effects compared to  radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone.  
 
6.3.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
Cetuximab  administered as monotherapy or in combination with concomitant 
chemothe rapy or radiation therapy exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics. The area 
under the  concentration time curve (AUC) increased in a greater than dose 
proportional manner  while clearance of cetuximab decreased from 0.08 to 0.02 
L/h/m
2 as the dose increased  from  20 to 200 mg/m2, and at doses >200 mg/m2, it 
appeared to plateau. The volume  of the distribution for cetuximab appeared to be 
independent of dose and approximated the vascular space of 2 –3 L/m2. 
 
Following the recommended dose regimen (400 mg/m2 initial d ose; 250 mg/m2 
weekly dose), concentrations of cetuximab reached steady -state levels by [CONTACT_904364] 168 to 235 and 41 to 85 μg/mL, respectively. The mean half -life of cetuxi mab 
was approximately 112 hours (range 63–230 hours). The pharmacokinetics of  
cetuximab were similar in patients with SCCHN and those with colorectal cancer.  
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, female patients with colorectal  
cancer had a 25% l ower intrinsic clearance of cetuximab than male patients.  
Qualitatively similar, but smaller gender differences in cetuximab clearance were 
observed in patients with SCCHN. The gender differences in clearance do not  
necessitate any alteration of dosing because of a similar safety profile.  
 
6.3.4 Supplier  
 
Cetuximab is commercially available and is listed in the compendia as indicated for 
the therapy of SCCHN.  
 
6.3.5 Dosage Form  
 
Each single- use, ready to use  50-mL vial contains 100 mg of cetuximab at a 
concentration of 2 mg/mL and is formulated in a preservative -free solution 
containing 8.48 mg/mL sodium chloride, 1.88 mg/mL sodium phosphate dibasic 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   50 of 98 heptahydrate, 0.42mg/mL sodium phosphate monobasic monohydra te, and Water 
for injection, USP. 
  
6.3.6 Storage and Stability  
 
Cetuximab should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. Store 
vials under refrigeration at 2ο C to 8ο C (36ο F to 46ο F). DO NOT FREEZE. 
Increased particulate formation may occur at temperatures at or below 0οC.  This 
product contains no preservatives.  Preparations of cetuximab in infusion containers 
are chemically and physically stable for up to 12 hours at 2ο C to 8ο C (36ο F to 46ο 
F) or up to 8 hours at controlled room temperature (20ο C to 25ο C; 68ο F to 77ο F).  
Discard any remaining solution in the infusion container after [ADDRESS_1269061]. 
It is recommended that patients wear sunscreen and hats and limit sun exposure 
while receiving cetuximab as sunlight can exacerbate any skin reactions that may occur.  
 
6.3.8 Premedication  
 
In an effort to prevent a hypersensitivity reaction, all patients will be premedicated 
with diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg (or an equivalent antihistamine) IVPB 
given 30- 60 minutes prior to the Cetuximab.  Premedication will also include 
solucortef 100 mg IVPB and albuterol inhalation (by [CONTACT_703155]) according to standard of care procedures.  
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_1269062] be 
administered with the use of a low protein binding 0.22 -micrometer in -line filter. 
Cetuximab is supplied as a 50- mL, single -use vial containing 100 mg of cetuximab 
at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline. DO NOT SHAKE OR DILUTE.  Adequate hydration must be maintained before administration as 
described in the treatment section  
 
Cetuximab can be administer ed via infusion pump. 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   51 of 98  
Infusion Pump:  
 
• Draw up the volume of a vial using a sterile syringe attached to an appropriate 
needle (a vented spi[INVESTIGATOR_333485]).  
• Fill cetuximab into a sterile evacuated container or bag such as glass containers, polyolefin bags (e.g., Baxter Intravia), ethylene vinyl acetate bags (e.g., Baxter Clintec), DEHP plasticized PVC bags (e.g., Abbott Lifecare), or PVC bags . 
• Repeat procedure until the calculated volume has been put in to the container.  Use a new needle for each vial.  
• Administer through a low protein binding 0.22- micrometer in -line filter (placed 
as proximal to the patient as practical).  
• Affix the infusion line and prime it with cetuximab before starting the infusion.  
• Maximum infusion rate should not exceed 5 mL/min. 
• Use 0.9% saline solution to flush line at the end of infusion. 
• The infusion rate of cetuximab must never exceed 10 mg/minute (5 mL/min). The in fusion time of cetuximab should not exceed [ADDRESS_1269063] -infusion 
observation hour. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature) will be 
monitored and recorded prior to the administration of cetuximab, 1/[ADDRESS_1269064] -infusion for the initial 
dose. During all subsequent administrations of cetuximab, vital signs will be monitored and recorded prior to administration of cetuximab and at the end of the infusion; however, it is recommended t hat the patient be obse rved for [ADDRESS_1269065] 
infusion. 
  
7.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
At each of the scheduled visits noted in the study calendar, an assessment of adverse events (AE’s) will be made by [CONTACT_904365] 3. 
Patients without AEs will continue on study treatment as planned. Patients who develop grade 1 -
2 or selected grade 3 (nausea/vomiting/fatigue) AEs will be supported symptomatically and encouraged to continue on study treatment as planned. Modif ications in their therapy may be 
necessary and will be detailed below.  Management of specific AEs is noted below. Omitted doses 
will not be made up at a later date. Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of 
medical/surgical events or logistical re asons not related to study therapy.

7.1.2 Administration of Study Drug to Patients with Abnormal Hematologic Function  
 
nab-Paclitaxel  dosing should not be administered at the start of each cycle until the 
absolute neutrophil count returns to >  1.5 x 109 cells/L and the platelet count returns 
to > 100 x 109 cells/L.  For patients receiving weekly nab -Paclitaxel , patients must 
have an ANC >  0.5 x 109 cells/L and platelets > 50  x 109 cells/L  for the Day 8 and 
Day 15 doses .  If the ANC and platelets are not adequate for treatment on Day 8 
and/or 15, the dose will be omitted and the total cycle length remains the same.    
 
7.1.3 Administration of Study Drug to Patients with Abnormal Hepatic Function 
 For patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > ULN and ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_1269066] ≤ [ADDRESS_1269067]), no dose adjustments are required regardless of indication.  For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin between 1.[ADDRESS_1269068]), reduce nab -paclitaxel by [CONTACT_30560].  Do not administer nab-
paclitaxel to patients with total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1269069] > [ADDRESS_1269070] not been studied. 
 
7.1.4 Peripheral  Neuropathy  
 Peripheral neuropathy is dos e- and schedule -dependent.  The occurrence of grade 
1 or 2 peripheral neuropathy does not generally require dose modification.  If ≥ 
grade 3 peripheral neuropathy develops, withhold nab- paclitaxel until resolution to 
≤ grade [ADDRESS_1269071] been reported .  If 
they do occur, minor symptoms such as flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, lower 
back pain, hypotension, or tachycardia may require temporary interruption of the 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   53 of 98 infusion.  However, severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring treatment, 
dyspnea req uiring bronchodilators, angioedema , or generalized urticaria require 
immediate discontinuation of study drug administration and aggressive symptomatic therapy.  Patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to nab-paclitaxel  should not be re -challenged.   The use of nab- paclitaxel in patients 
previously exhibiting hypersensitivity to paclitaxel injection or human albumin has not been studied. 
 
7.1.6 Other Toxicities  
 
If toxicities are >  grade [ADDRESS_1269072] possibly 
be related to nab -paclitaxel , except for anemia and lymphopenia , treatment should 
be withheld until resolution to <  grade 1 or baseline if baseline was greater than 
grade 1, then reinstituted, if medically appropriate, at the next low er dose level.  
  
7.1.7 Dose Reductions and G uidelines for Optional Use of Growth Factors

Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_904296], and appropriate treatment of these symptoms initiated.  Dose modifications of any future cetuximab infusions should be instituted in case of grade 3 acneiform rash.  Treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or oral antibiotics (minoc ycline 100 mg bid) should be 
considered , but should not be given prophylactically ; topi[INVESTIGATOR_904297].

7.3.2 Management of Gastrointestinal Adverse Effects  
 
Antiemetic agents may be administered prior to the administration of cetuximab.  Diarrhea will be treated symptomatically with antidiarrheal agents.  Should GI toxicity become severe enough to require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_743521], all treatment should be discontinued temporarily until the patient’s condition improves. 
 
7.3.3 Management of Hypersensitivity  Reactions  
 
Grading : 
Mild ( grade 1) hypersensitivity reactions ( HSRs ) consist of urticaria, fever, or chills 
and are treated with symptom -directed management.  
 Moderate ( grade 2) HSRs consist of dyspnea, angioedema, or hypotension which 
reverses within one to two hours of appropriate symptom -directed management and 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_904298]. Symptom -directed management includes 
nebulized b
2 agonists (albuterol 2.5 mg) for dyspnea and bronchospasm, 
intravenous fluid boluses (normal saline 1- 2 liters) for hypot ension, and the use of 
H1 and H2 antagonists (diphenhydramine and famotidine) and corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg).  
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   57 of 98  
Severe ( grade 3 ) HSRs consist of dyspnea, angioedema, or hypotension, as the 
Grade 2 reactions do, but do not  reverse following one to two hours of symptom 
directed management.  
 
Life-threatening/ disabling ( grade 4) HSRs consist of airway obstruction, shock, 
cardiac arrest, or prolonged hypotension.  Grade 4  HSRs  require the immediate interruption of cetuximab therapy and 
permanent discontinuation from further treatment.  Appropriate medical therapy including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen should be available for use in the treatment of such reactions.  Patients should be carefully observed until the complete resolution of all signs and symptoms.  
In prior clinical trials, grade 1 and grade 2  infusion reactions were managed by 
[CONTACT_904366] -
medications (e.g., diphenhydramine) in subsequent doses.  If the patient experiences a g rade 3 infusion reaction, the infusion rate should be permanently 
reduced by 50%.  For grade [ADDRESS_1269077] -
dosing with an appropriate antipyretic, the infusion rate for subsequent dosing 
should be 50% of previous rate.  
 
7.3.5 Management of Pulmonary Adverse Effects  
 
In the event of acute onset (grade ≥ 2) or worsening pulmonary symptoms which 
are not thought to be related to underlying cancer, cetuximab therapy should be interrupted and a prompt investigation of these symptoms should occur. Cetuximab re-treatment should not occur unt il these symptoms have resolved to grade 1. If 
interstitial lung disease is confirmed, cetuximab should be discontinued and the patient should be treated appropriately.  
 
7.3.6 Management of Renal Adverse Effects  
 Hypomagnesemia has been reported with cetuximab when administered as a single agent and in combination with multiple different chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients receiving cetuximab should be monitored for hypomagnesemia. Magnesium repletion may be necessary based on clinical judgment.

8.1 Genomic Analysis    
 Our hypothesis is that the
 high anti -tumor efficacy of nab -paclitaxel in HNSCC is due to 
the frequent presence of Ras and PI3K (and EGFR) pathway activation in this cancer.   Pre-
treatment tumor biopsies will undergo mutational (and IHC) analyses of the PI3 kinase pathway and H -ras. Mutational analysis of the PI3 Kinase pathway includes PIK3CA, 
PIK3CG, PTEN, PIK3R1 and PIK3R5. IHC analysis of the PI3kinase pathway includes 
EGF R, AKT, PIK3CA, PTEN, MET and pS6 kinase . The association of these biomarkers 
with CR at the PTS and relapse events will be evaluated.

46-49. Our hypothesis is that nab- paclitaxel will deplete Tregs, 
decrease PD -L1, and increase TIL at the PTS . PTS tumor biopsies obtained before and 
after 2 cycles of nab- paclitaxel induction chemotherapy (Arms 1 -3) will be analyzed for 
Tregs, TIL, and PD -L1 by [CONTACT_4658].  IHC analysis includes TIL markers and PD -L1. CD3, CD4, 
CD8, Foxp3 and the monocytic marker CD116  will also be analyzed.  The association of 
these biomarkers (before nab- paclitaxel and the change after 2 cycles of nab- paclitaxel) 
with CR at the PTS and relapse events will be evaluated.  
 Specimens shall be transported to the Washington University  lab c/o [CONTACT_904385] , 
located on the [ADDRESS_1269080]. building  or shipped to the address listed 
below:  
 [CONTACT_889708] – Research lab

8.3 Quality of Life Assessments 
 
Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires will be administered to patients at baseline, prior to 
starting radiation, at the last week of radiation, at the 6 -month follow -up visit, and at the 
12-month follow -up visit.  The 4 -page questionnaire will assess physical, social, emotional, 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   59 of 98 and functional well -being through questions designed specifically for patients with head & 
neck cancer.  An additional 4- question QOL survey will assess symptoms of peripheral 
neuropathy, a side effect often seen in patients receiving nab- paclitaxel.  
 
 9.0 DEFINITION OF TUMOR RESPONSE CRITERIA 
 
9.1 Visual Categorical Outcomes  
 
Visual categorical outcomes will be used to assess tumor response at the primary site and 
involved regional nodes after two cycles of induction chemotherapy and after completion 
of definitive radiation and concurrent cetuximab therapy . Primary site responses will be 
dictated in ENT note.  Neck node measurements will be taken from the medical oncology physical exam measurements also dictated, but into the medical oncology note.  
 
Visual Categorical Outcomes  
CR Complete resolution – 100% decrease /minimal residual mucosal abnormality  
PR 99-50% decrease  
SD 49-0% decrease  
PD Any increase  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1269082] 1.0 criteria will be used to assess anatomic tumor res ponse ( Appendix 2).   
 
9.3 PET/CT Imaging  
 
FDG -PET/CT will be utilized to assess tumor metabolic response. PET/CT imaging will 
be performed with a PET/CT scanner   All patients will undergo FDG -PET/CT imaging at 
baseline (no more than 42 days prior to Cycle 1 day 1) , between C ycle 2 D ays 16  and 20, 
and at 16  weeks  (+/- 2 weeks)  following completion of definitive radiation therapy  in 
accordance with the Division of Nuclear Medicine standard procedure for FDG -whole -
body tumor imaging.   Care should be taken to match follow -up examinations as close as 
possible to the baseline imaging parameters with no more than [ADDRESS_1269083] also adhere to the minimum 50 minutes of uptake time.  In rare instances uptake times of greater than 70 minutes are allowed providing the overall uptake time does not go beyond the 10 minute deviation from baseline examination.  Each patient will undergo all 3 FDG -PET/CT scans even if s/he has measurable disease by [CONTACT_904367].  
 The standard whole -body examination for FDG -PET/CT ima ging in patients with head and 
neck cancer typi[INVESTIGATOR_904299].  An i.v. 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a 20 - or 22- gauge Angiocath) or butterfly needle will be placed in an upper 
extremity vein for injection of FDG and i.v. hy dration (up to 500 ml of 0.9% saline 
solution).  The administered dose of FDG will be based upon subject weight and range 
from a minimum of 10 mCi to a maximum of 20 mCi with up to a 20% range on each side 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   60 of 98 of maximum and minimum dose allowed.  FDG will be administered intravenously.  In 
cases of poor venous access (butterfly injection of FDG), oral hydration will replace 
intravenous hydration.  Approximately 60 (50- 70) minutes after injection of FDG, imaging 
will be initiated.     PET/CT imaging will be acc ording to local protocol.  The following is minimum suggested 
imaging requirements:  With the patient positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_904300]’s arms at the side of the body, the CT images used for attenuation correction and image fusion will be obtained.  The CT will consist of a 5- [ADDRESS_1269084] for attenuation correction.  Scans are reconstructed using a 5- mm slice thickness.  This is followed by a series of sequential 2 to  
5-minute emission scans at each bed position, beginning at the vertex of the skull and 
proceeding caudally to the upper thighs.  Images are reconstructed with ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and smoothing per scanner manufacturer recommendations   
  10.0 REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
The entities providing oversight of safety and compliance with the protocol require reporting as outline d below. 
 
The Washington University Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) requires that all events meeting the definition of unanticipated problem or serious noncompliance be reported as outlined in Section 7.2.  Celgene requires that all adverse events  be reported as outlined in Section 10.6.

 10.1.5 Unanticipated Problems  
 
Definition:  
 
• unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; a nd (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and 
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized.  
 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   62 of 98 10.1.6 Noncompliance 
 
Definition:  failure to follow any applicable regulation or institutional policies that 
govern human subjects research or failure to follow the determinations of the 
IRB.   Noncompliance may occur due to lack of knowledge or due to deliberate 
choice to ignore regulations, institutional policies, or determinations of the IRB.  
 
10.1.7 Serious Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  noncompliance that materially increases risks, that results in substantial 
harm to subjects or others, or that materially compromises the rights or welfare of participants.  
 
10.1.8 Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned deviation from the approved protocol t hat are under the 
research team’s control. Exceptions apply only to a single participant or a singular situation.  
 
Local IRB p re-approval of all protocol exceptions must be obtained prior to the 
event.  For secondary sites, the Washington University PI [INVESTIGATOR_904301], but it must also be submitted to the local IRB with documentation of approval forwarded to Washington University. Washington University IRB approval is not required for protocol exceptions occurring at secondary sites.  
 
10.2 Reporting to the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) at Washington 
University  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_31985]:  
 
• Any unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others which occur at WU, any BJH or SLC H institution, or that impacts participants or the conduct of 
the study.  
• Noncompliance with federal regulations or the requirements or determinations of the IRB.  
• Receipt of new information that may impact the willingness of participants to participate or continue participation in the research study.  
 
These events must be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1269085] keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_56594], including correspondence with 
Celgene and the IRB/EC, on file.  
 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   63 of 98 10.3 Reporting to the Qualit y Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(QASMC) at Washington University 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_904302].  (Unanticipated problems reported to HRPO and withdrawn during the review process need not be reported to QASMC.)  
 
QASMC must be notified within 10 days of receipt of IRB acknowledgment via email to  
a QASMC auditor. 
 
10.4 Reporting Requirements for Secondary Sites  
 
The research team at each secondary site is required to promptly notify the Washington University PI [INVESTIGATOR_205137] (as described in Section 10.6) within 1 working day of the occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary 
site’s PI [CONTACT_12581].  This notification may take place via email if there is not yet enough information for a formal written report (using either an FDA MedWatch form if required or an institutional SAE reporting form if not) .  A formal written report must be sent to the 
Washington University PI [INVESTIGATOR_205935] 10 working days  of the 
occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s PI [CONTACT_12581].  The death of a research participant that qualif ies as a reportable event should be reported within 1 
working day  of the occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s PI [INVESTIGATOR_205936].  
 
The research team at a secondary site is responsible for following its site’s guidelines for reporting applicable events to its site’s IRB according to its own institutional guidelines.  
The research team at Washington University is responsible for reporting all applicable events to the FDA.  
 
10.5 Reporting to Secondary Sites  
 
The Washington University  PI (or designee) will notify the research team at each secondary 
site of all reportable events that have occurred at other sites  within [ADDRESS_1269086]’s health, including laboratory  test values (as specified by [CONTACT_65801]), 
regardless of e tiology.  Any worsening  (i.e., any clinically  significant adverse change in 
the freq uenc y or intens ity of a pre- existing condi tion) should be considered an AE.  
 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment [ADDRESS_1269087] should be reported as an 
AE.  If an overdose is associated with an AE, the overdose and adverse event should be 
reported as separat e terms. 
 All patient s will be monitored for AEs during the stud y.  Assessments may include 
monitoring of an y or all of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, 
laborator y, patho logical, radiologica l or surgica l findings, physical exam ination findings, 
or other appropriate tests and procedures.  
 All AEs will be recorded by  [CONTACT_904368] [ADDRESS_1269088] be reported to Ce lgene Drug 
Safet y within 24 hours of the Inves tigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or  other  
appropr iate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form  using the 
contact [CONTACT_31307]:

10.6.1 Seriousness  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_73829], the subject is at 
immediate risk of death from the AE);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_904303])  
• Results in persistent or signific ant disability/incapacity (a substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Constitutes an important medical event.  
 
Important  medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191], or disabili ty, but 
may jeopard ize the subject  or requi re medica l or surgi cal interven tion to prevent 
one of t he other outcomes listed above. Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious. 
 
 
 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   65 of 98 Events not considered  to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
• A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication of therapy administration will be reported as an SAE.  
• Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated 
with any deterioration in condition. 
• The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of 
studied indication.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_904304] a complication of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.  
• A procedure for protocol/disease -related investigations (e.g., surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests , bone marrow sampling).  
However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication of 
such procedures remains a reportable SAE.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or 
social reasons, in absence of an  AE. 
• A procedure that is planned (i.e., planned prior to start of treatment on study).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication remains a reportable SAE.  
• An elective treatment of a pre- existing condition unrelated to the studied 
indication.  
• Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.  
 
10.6.2 Severit y / Intensity  
 
For both AEs and SAEs, the Inves tigator  must  assess  the severi ty / intens ity of the 
even t. 
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensi ty of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate or severe myocardial  infarc tion); the event itself, however, may be 
of rela tively mino r medical significance (such as severe headache).  This criteri on 
is not the same as “serious” which is  based on subject/event  outcome  or action 
criteria associ ated with events that pose a threat to a  subject’s life or func tioning.  
 Seriousness, not  severi ty, serve s as a guide for definin g regul atory obliga tions. 
 
10.6.[ADDRESS_1269090] determine the rela tionship between the administration o f 
IP and/or gemcitabin e and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or 
Suspected as defined below:  
 
• Not suspected: Th e temporal relationship of the adverse event to IP 
admini stration makes a causal relationship unlikely or remote, or other 
medicat ions, therapeut ic interventi ons, or underlying  condi tions provide  a 
sufficient  explanati on for the observed event.  
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   66 of 98  
• Suspected: The temporal relationship of the adverse event to IP 
administrat ion makes a causal relationship possibl e, and other 
medicat ions, therapeutic intervent ions, or underlying  condi tions do not 
provide a sufficient explana tion for the observed event. 
 
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparat or, ancillary or 
additional IP that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please 
provide the name [CONTACT_27765].  
10.6.[ADDRESS_1269091] op 
dates o f the even t. 
 
10.6.5 Action Taken  
 
The Investigator will report the  action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, 
as applicable ( eg., discont inuation or reduction of I P, as appropriate)  and repor t if 
conc omitant and/or addi tional treatments were given for the  event. 
 
10.6.[ADDRESS_1269092]’s participa tion 
in the study mus t be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not 
recovered (death due to another cause) or death (due to the SA E). 
 10.6.7 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
 
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study;  
• Require treatment, modification/interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic intervention, or  
• Is judged  to be of significant clinical importance.  
 
Regardless  of severi ty grade,  only laborator y abnor malities that fulfill a seriousness 
criterion need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
 
10.6.8 Pregnancies  
 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on IP, or within [ADDRESS_1269093]’s last dose of IP, are considered immediately 
reportab le events.  IP is to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected 
pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment [ADDRESS_1269094] notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up 
Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
 If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other  appropriate method, 
within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
 All neonatal deaths that occur  within [ADDRESS_1269095] to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immed iately by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
 
10.6.[ADDRESS_1269096] be reported to Ce lgene Drug Safet y within 24 hours of the 
Inves tigato r’s knowledge of the event by  [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, 
using the S AE Repor t Form, or approved equivalent form.  This instruct ion pertains  
to initial SAE reports as well as any f ollow-up reports.  
 The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and 
consistent.  This requirement applies to all SAEs (regard less of relationship to IP) that occur 
during the study (from the time the  patient signs informed consent to [ADDRESS_1269097] dose of IP), and those made known to the Investigator at an ytime thereafter 
that are suspected of being  related  to IP. SAEs occurring prior to treatment will be 
captured.  
 The SAE report should provide a detailed descript ion of the SAE  and include  
summaries  of hospi [INVESTIGATOR_27598].  If a  patient died and 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   68 of 98 an autopsy  has been perform ed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_904305] y report and death certificate 
are to be sent to Celgene Drug Sa fety as soon as these bec ome available. Any 
follow-up data will be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safe ty. 
 
Where required by  [CONTACT_210072], the Inves tigator is responsible for informing 
the IRB/EC of t he SAE and providing them with all relevant ini tial and follow-up 
infor mation about the event . The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_904306]/EC.  
 
10.6.11 Expedited  Reporting  of Adverse Events  
 
For the purpose of regulatory  reporting , Celgene Drug Safet y will determine the 
expectedness of events suspected of being relat ed to nab-paclitaxel based  on the 
Inves tigator  Brochure.  
 Celgene  or its author ized representative shall notify  the Inves tigator  of the 
following infor mation: 
 
• Any AE  suspected of being related to  the use of IP in this study  or in other 
studi es that is both serious and unexpected ( ie., S[LOCATION_003]R);  
• Any finding fr om tests in laboratory  animals that suggests a significant risk 
for huma n patients including  reports  of mutagenicit y, teratogenici ty, or 
carcinogenici ty. 
 
The Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly o f these new serious and 
unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to patien ts. The Inves tigator is also 
responsible to report all SAEs to t he FDA within [ADDRESS_1269098] day of study treatment.  For 
the purposes of this protocol, adverse events that meet the definition of serious (as per Sections 10.1.2 and 10.6.1) but occur outside of the induction period will not be considered SAEs unless determined to be at least possibly related to nab -Paclitaxel.  The induction 
period starts at time of informed consent and continues through [ADDRESS_1269099] -completion of radiation. Also refer to Section 11.3, Paragraph 2.  
      
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   69 of 98 11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Study Design   
This is a non- randomized phase II trial with three parallel treatment arms whose primary 
objective is to determine the CR rate by [CONTACT_904369] 1 weekly nab- Paclitaxel with P (AP) given for two cycles (over  6 weeks) , 
Arm 2:  weekly nab -Paclitaxel (A) given for two cycles (over 6 weeks) , and Arm 3  (HPV -
related OPSCC): AP given for two cycles (over 6 weeks) in patients with locally advanced non-metastatic HNSCC.  
 Arms 1 and 2:  Each treatment group will be compared with a historical control from the 
APF study. There will be no comparison between the AP and A treatment groups.   The primary endpoint for each arm (AP or A) is that the PTS CR rate will be non -inferior 
to the PTS CR rate observed with APF (77%). A C R rate ≥ 58%, or no more than 19% less 
than the historically observed 77%, will be considered noninferior.  
 In each treatment group patient recruitment will be stratified by [CONTACT_344821] (positive/negative) in order to ensure that the proportion of positive and negative patients is approximately equal in the two treatment groups. The expected CR rate is 77% in both HPV positive and negative patients.  
 
For the following secondary objectives, the analysis of primary tumor site response to the IC regimen will a lso be stratified based on T stage (T2 vs. T3 vs. T4) and will be reported 
as frequencies (with 95% confidence intervals) in each T stage category.  For purposes of 
testing hypotheses, stratification will be included as an adjustment variable in:  
 Documenting the clinical partial response (PR) rate at the primary tumor site and 
the clinical CR and PR rates at the involved regional nodes  following two cycles of 
AP or A;  
 Documenting the anatomic tumor response as assessed by [CONTACT_904370] A;  
 Documenting and quantifying Ki -67 expression  by [CONTACT_904371] A and correlate these results with clinical primary tumor site response to AP or A;  
 Documenting and grading AE’s  with AP or A, and comparing to those observed 
with APF;  
 Determining median or year -by-year overall survival ( OS), disease- free survival 
(DFS), and progression- free survival ( PFS) in these patients; an d, 
 Documenting the measures of Quality of Life ( QoL) before, during, and at one year 
after completion of treatment in both treatment groups. 
    
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   70 of 98 ARM 3:  This  arm will be c ompa red with Arm 1 (data as of October, 2017). 
 
The primary endpoint is to determine the median percent weight loss in patients with 
HPV- positive OPSCC who are treated with AP. De -escalated CRT will reduce the 
median percent weight loss by 50% compared to CRT. Mucosal toxicity during CRT 
resulted in a median weight loss of 13.1% (range: 5%  - 23.2%) in Arm 1 (null 
hypothesis). We hypothesize that the de -escalated CRT regimen in Arm 3 will result in 
a 50% reduction in the median weight loss (alternative hypothesis).  
 
A secondary endpoint for Arm 3:  The PTS CR rate will be non-inferior to  the PTS CR 
rate observed with APF (77%). A CR rate ≥ 58%, or no more than 19% l ess than the  
histo rically observed 77%, will be  considered noninf erior. 
 
For the followi ng secondary objectives (except AEs and QOLs) , the analysis of primary 
tumor site response  to the IC regimen will also be  stratified based on T  stage (T1/2 vs. 
T3 vs. T 4) and will be  reported as frequencies (with 95%  confidence intervals) in each T 
stage category.  For pur poses of testing  hypothe ses, stratification will be  included as an 
adjustm ent var iable in: 
 
 Documenting  the clinica l partial respons e (PR) rate at the primary tumor  site and 
the clinical  CR and PR rates at the involve d regional node s following  two cycles 
of IC; 
 Documenting  the anatomic tumor  respons e as assessed by [CONTACT_904372] c ycles of IC; 
 Documenting  and quantifying Ki-67 expression  b y IHC and histolo gic tumor 
response  in primary tumor tissue  obtained at baseline and followi ng two cycles of 
IC and correlate these results with clinica l tumor response at the pr imary 
tumor  site; 
 Documenting  and grading AE’s and compar ing to those  observed with A rm 1; 
 Determining  median or year-by-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival 
(DFS), and progression -free survival (PFS) in th ese patients; a nd, 
 Documenting  the measures of Quality of Life (QoL) before, during, and at one 
year after compl etion of  treatme nt. 
 In addition, the study will compare arm 3 to arm 1 (the AP arm) as follows:  
• Response rate, OS, DFS, and PFS. 
• Rate of grade 3 -4 AEs during CRT.  
• The median absolute and percent weight loss during CRT.  
 
11.2 Analysis Plan and Study Power  
 Arms 1 and 2:  Two one -sample tests for noninferiority, stratified by [CONTACT_344821], will be 
used to determine whether the CR with AP or A is no more than 19% less than the CR rate with APF.  Given an expected rate of CR with APF is 77%, a 19% difference (58% vs 77%) is considered to be clinically equivalent.  With a noninferiority margin of 19%, a sample of 40 patients will provide each treatment group with power = 0.80 power at a 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   71 of 98 significance level of 0.05 to conclude that the CR rate with AP or A is not inferior to that 
with APF.  
 Proportions of patients with clinical PR at the primary tumor site, clinical CR and PR rates at the involved regional nodes, anatomic and metabolic tumor responses, and AEs by [CONTACT_24975], grade and patient will be calculated with 95% confidence interva ls. The proportion of 
patients with grade 3 -4 AEs is 40% in the APF study. It is expected to be at least 25% 
lower with AP (40% decreased to 30%) and at least 50% lower with A (40% decreased to 20%).  
 
Arm 3:  The primary hypothesis for Arm 3 is: de -escalated CRT will reduce the median 
percent weight loss by 50% compared to CRT. Mucosal toxicity during CRT resulted in 
a median weight loss of 13.1% (range: 5% -  23.2%) in Arm 1 (null hypothesis). We 
hypothesize that the de -escalated CRT regimen in Arm 3 will result in a 50% 
reduction in the median weight loss (alternative hypothesis). If weight loss is 50% of 
the historical amount (that is, about 6.5% vs. historical 13.1%), the standard deviation of percent weight loss is about the same as the mean (that is, ± 1 3%), then 
a sample of 30 patients will provide power=.[ADDRESS_1269100] will be used to compare median weight loss during 
CRT in arm 3 vs. arm 1. Median weight loss will be calculated in the treatment arm with bootstrapped confidence intervals. 
 All Arms : Nonparametric Wilcoxon tests will be used to compare Ki- 67 expression by 
[CONTACT_904373]. Two clustered logistic reg ression (GEE) models also may be used to 
quantify the odds of histologic tumor response over time by [CONTACT_904374]. AE rates during CRT will be described as binomial proportions with exact 
95% confidence intervals in arm [ADDRESS_1269101] for differences in AE rates with  a false discovery 
rate adjustment for multiple testing if >5 tests are carried out. Kaplan -Meier models will 
be used to estimate median OS, DFS, and PFS (if the median is reached) and to estimate 1 and 2 year rates of OS, DFS, and PFS with 95% confidence intervals. Kaplan -Meier models 
will be used to compare OS, DFS and PFS in arm 3 vs. arm 1 . 
 All Arms : Summary and subscale scores from the FACT -N&N and the FACT -GOG- NTX-
4 will be plotted at baseline, completion of treatment, and one year after end of treatment.  Ordinal logistic regression will be used to estimate the association of demographic, clinical, and response covariates with QOL at each time point.  Generalized estimating equations (GEE) may be used to estimate the association of the same covariates with change in QOL over time.  These plots and models are exploratory and descriptive.  
 
11.3 Adverse Primary Outcome Monitoring  
 
The rate of unfavorabl e PTS response, SD + PD, will be monitored using a continuous 
toxicity monitoring rule. The observed SD + PD rate in the APF study was 7%, and the maximum allowable rate is considered to be 20%. Enrollment will be suspended for review 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment [ADDRESS_1269102] 37, or if the 7th is observed before the 40th patient  has completed the trial.  Forty 
patients will be accrued to each arm of the study.  
 
In Arm 3 , unfavorable response will be monitored as the number of relapses, also using 
continuous toxicity monitoring criteria. The expected relapse rate is 10%, and the 
maximum acceptable rate is 2 5%. A modified Pocock boundary with boundary shape

Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   73 of 98 13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, an 
independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be specifically convened for this trial to review toxicity data at least every [ADDRESS_1269107] to the trial principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or appropriate university officials, in accordance with institution policies. Potential conflicts that develop during a trial or a member’s tenure on a DSMC must also be disclosed.   The DSM report will be prepared by [CONTACT_32023], will be reviewed by [CONTACT_6802], and will be submitted to the Quality Assurance  and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (QASMC).  This report will include: 
• HRPO protocol number, protocol title, Principal Investigator [CONTACT_2300], data coordinator name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician  
• Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, date of HRPO expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], date of most recent QA audit, study status, and phase of study  
• History of study including summary of substantive amendments; summary of accrual suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol exceptions, error, or breach of confidentiality including start/stop dates and reason  
• Study -wide target accrual and study -wide actual accrual including numbers from 
participating sites  
• Protocol activation date at each participating site  
• Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years at each participating site

be prepared by [CONTACT_205180] 6 months after study activat ion at Washington University.  
The study principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_288871]. Once the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9046], the AE will be reported to the HRPO and QASMC according 
to institutional guidelines.  
 
 
Version 3/25/2020: Amendment 10   74 of 98 14.0 AUDITING  
 
Since Washington University is the coordinating center, each site will be audited annually by [CONTACT_295805] (QASMC) unless the outside institutio n has an auditing 
mechanism in place and can provide a report. The outside sites will be asked to send copi[INVESTIGATOR_205143], including source documentation.  The audit notification will be sent to the Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will obtain the audit materials from the participating institution.  
 
Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the audit. Once accrual numbers are confirmed, and approximately [ADDRESS_1269108] of the 
cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be sent to the research team. However, if during the audit the need arises to review cases not initially selected, the research team will be asked to provide the additional charts wit hin two working days.

Version 10/04/19: Amendment 9  85 of 98 APPENDIX 2:  Criteria  for Response , Progression , and  Relapse  
 
At baseline, tumor lesions will be characterized as either measurable or non -measurable.  
 
Measurable : 
Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension  (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as > 20 mm (2.0 cm) with conventional techniques or as > 10 mm (1.0 cm) with spi[INVESTIGATOR_89391]. If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
 
Non-Measurable : 
All other lesions, including small lesions [longest diameter < 20 mm (2.0 cm) with conventional 
techniques or < 10 mm (1.0 cm) with spi[INVESTIGATOR_25457]] and truly non- measurable lesions. Lesions 
considered to be truly non- measurable include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial  effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218], and cystic lesions. Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable. The conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol when appropriate.  
 
Target Lesions : 
All measurable lesions up to a ma ximum of 10 lesions representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. Target 
lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suita bility for accurate repetitive measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A 
sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to fur ther characterize the 
objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  
Disappearance of all target lesions. Where response is the primary endpoint, changes in tumor 
measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_279071] [ADDRESS_1269113] met. Longer intervals as determined by t he Principal Investigator  
[INVESTIGATOR_904314].  
 
Partial Response (PR):   
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD. Where response is the primary endpoint, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_279071] [ADDRESS_1269114] met. Longer intervals as determined by [CONTACT_079]  
[INVESTIGATOR_904314].  
 
Progression (PD):   
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as references the smallest 
sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase  to qualify for PD taking as 
references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. Patients having a documented 
response with no reconfirmation of the response will be listed with stable disease.   
 
Version 10/04/19: Amendment 9  86 of 98  
Non-target Lesions : 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) not included in the “target disease” definition should be 
identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not 
required and these lesions should be followed as “present” or “absent.”  
 
Complete Response (CR ):  
Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. If tumor 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-complete response (non -CR)/Non -progression (non -PD):  
Persistence of one or more non- target lesion and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
upper limits of normal.  
 Progression (PD):  
Appearance of one or more new lesions. Unequivocal progres sion of existing non- target lesions. 
Although a clear progression of non- target lesions is exceptional, in such circumstances, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_904315] (or Principal Investigator ). 
 
Cytology and Histology : 
If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
 
These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare ca ses (for example, 
residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response : 
The best overall response should be recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient’s best response assignmen t will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  
 
Target Lesions  Non-target Lesions  New Lesions  Overall Response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Non-CR/Non -PD No PR 
PR Non-PD No PR 
SD Non-PD No SD 
PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
 
Version 10/04/19: Amendment 9  87 of 98 Note: In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine  needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before 
confirming the complete response status.  
 
First Documentation of Response:  
The time between initiation of therapy and first documentation of PR or CR. 
 
Confirmation of Response:  
To be assigned a status of complete or partial response, changes in tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_15226].  
 
Duration of Response:  
Duration of overall response – the period measured from the time that measurement criteria are 
met for complete or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, taking as reference the s mallest 
measurements recorded since treatment started.  
 
Duration of Overall Complete Response:  
The period measured from the time measurement criteria are met for complete response until the 
first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
 
Duration of Stable Disease:  
A measurement from registration until the criteria for disease progression is met, taking as 
reference the smallest measurements recorded since registration. To be assigned a status of stable 
disease, measurements must have met th e stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at 
a minimum interval (in general, not less than eight weeks).  
 
Survival:  
Survival will be measured from the date of entry on study.  
 
Time to Progression:  
This interval will be measured from the date of entry on the study to the appearance of new 
metastatic lesions or objective tumor progression.  
 
Methods of Measurement:  
Imaging based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_12148]. The same imaging 
modality must be used throughout the study to measure disease.  
 
Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease : 
Clinical Lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules, palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.  
Chest X -ray:  
Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and 
surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
  
 
Version 10/04/19: Amendment [ADDRESS_1269115] and MRI:  
Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_1269116], abdomen, and pelvis. Head & neck and extremities usually require 
specific protocols.  
 
Ultrasound:  
Ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions that are clinically not easily accessible when the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation. It is a possible alt ernative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable nodes, subcutaneous lesions, 
and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  
 
Endoscopy and Laparoscopy:  
Endoscopy and Laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not yet been fully and widely 
validated. Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers. There fore, the utilization of such 
techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in reference centers. However, such techniques can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained.  
Tumor Mark ers: 
Tumor Markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Confirmation Measurement/Duration of Response : 
Confi rmatio n to be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_89425] [ADDRESS_1269117] once after study entry at a minimum interval of not less than 6 weeks.  
 
Duration of Overall Response:    
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall complete response is measured from t he time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
 Duration of Stable Disease : 
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, tak ing as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.

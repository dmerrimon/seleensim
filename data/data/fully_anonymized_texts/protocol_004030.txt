Title: Real world effectiveness of combining an employer- based weight management program with 
medication for chronic weight management in employees with obesity –a pragmatic randomized trial 
Sponsor: Novo Nordisk
Study Treatment: Cleveland Clinic’s Integrated Medical Weight Management Program (WMP) 
with medication approved for chronic weight management in the US, i.e., “WMP + Rx”
Active Ingredient: One of following approved medications: orlistat (per os (p.o.)), lorcaserin or 
lorcaserin extended-release (p.o.), phentermine/topi[INVESTIGATOR_43642]-release (p.o.), 
naltrexone/bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_43643] -release (p.o.), liraglutide 3.0 mg (subcutaneous (s.c.))
Comparator Treatment: Cleveland Clinic’s Integrated Medical WMP with no medication for 
weight ma nagement, i.e., “WMP”
Protocol No.: NN8022-4432
Study Site: This is a single- center study conducted at the Cleveland Clinic’s Endocrinology and 
Metabolism Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.
Country: [LOCATION_002]
Subjects: Eligible subjects include adults with obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2) enrolled 
in the Cleveland Clinic Employee Health Plan for whom treatment with medication for chronic 
weight management may be indicated.
Planned enrollment in this study is 200. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either WMP + Rx 
or WMP alone.
Study Objectives : The objectives of this study are as follows:
xThe primary objective is to demonstrate superior effect of treatment with an employer- based 
weight management program in combination with medication for chronic weight 
management compared to an employer- based weight management program alone in subjects 
with obesity on weight loss.
xThe secondary objectives are to compare the effects of treatment with an employer- based 
weight management program in combination with medication for chronic weight 
management to an employer-based weight management program alone in subjects with obesity with regards to:
oCategorical weight loss
oAdherence to the weight management program
oPatient-reported outcomes (PROs) on work productivity and work limitations
xFurthermore, the secondary objectives will as sess adherence to medication for chronic 
weight management (only in the treatment arm randomized to an employer- based chronic 
weight management program with medication for chronic weight management).
Study Design: This is a one-year, single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel- group pragmatic 
clinical trial (PCT) comparing Cleveland Clinic’s existing Integrated Medical WMP combined with

Version 1.0; October 10, 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 9 of 57medication for chronic weight management versus Cleveland Clinic’s existing Integrated Medical 
WMP with no medication for weight management in subjects with obesity. Subjects will be 
randomized 1:1 to receive either Cleveland Clinic’s Integrated Medical WMP with medication for chronic weight management (“WMP + Rx”) or Cleveland Clinic’s Integrated Medical WMP alone 
(“WMP”).
To preserve the real
-world nature of the study, the subject experience will be as close to routine 
clinical care as possible. The weight management program provided to all study subjects will be 
similar to the Integrated Medical WMP that is currently offered by [CONTACT_43650]. Consistent with standard practice of the Integrated 
Medical WMP, subjects in both treatment groups will attend 
monthly shared medical appointments (SMA s) and will be responsible for a co- payment. In the WMP 
+ Rx arm, obesity medications approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for chronic 
weight management are allowed and selection of sp ecific medication is at the discretion of the study 
clinician. To simulate the co -payment that would be applied if a health plan covered treatment with 
medications for chronic weight management, subjects will pay a set fee for the obesity medication.
Study visits include an individual screening and randomization visit (visit 1; informed consent must 
be obtained at visit 1 before screening), followed by [CONTACT_43651] -monthly visits set up in the context 
of SMAs (visit 2 to visit 13). All subjects will be referred to a nutritionist appointment between visit 
1 and visit 2. End of Study (EOS) is visit 13 (month 12 (-14 days, +28 days)) . Effort will be made to 
obtain a month 12 (visit 13) weight measurement from all randomized subjects, unless they have 
withdrawn consent. There will not be a follow -up period.

Study Procedures :
xPotentially eligible subjects will be identified during the course of routine implementation of 
Cleveland Clinic’s Employee Wellness Program, "Healthy Choice," or referred to the study 
via the study advertisement or another health care provider.
xStudy clinicians will obtain informed written consent from subjects and if eligible, subjects 
will be randomized to either WMP + Rx or WMP.
xStudy data will be collected on electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) via an electronic data 
capture (EDC) system.

weight loss purposes is not allowed in either arm during the study.
oThe use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-
glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors for diabetes diagnosed during the study 
is not allowed.
xAssessments during monthly study (i.e., SMA) visits include: weight, pregnancy and serious 
adverse events (SAEs), attendance at SMAs, and use of disallowed medications.
xPrescription fill data for obesity medication (WMP + Rx arm) will be collected from 
randomization through EOS.
xQuestionnaires: PROs on work productivity and work limitations will be assessed by [CONTACT_43655] v2.0 
(WPAI:SHP) and the Work Limitations Questionnaire 8-Item (WLQ-8) Self- administered 
Short Form at visit 1, visit 7, and visit 13.
Study Duration: Total study duration for the individual subjects will be approximately one year. 
Subjects will be followed and data collection will continue for the full duration of the study, unless 
the subject withdraws informed consent. The full duration of the study is defined as up to and 
including visit 13. Effort will be made to obtain a month 12 (visit 13) weight measurement from all 
randomized subjects.
Analysis: Two estimands, each targeting a unique research question, have been defined to adequately 
describe the effect of an employer -based WMP combined with obesity medication compared to an 
employer -based WMP alone.
The primary estimand for all endpoints is an “intention -to-treat” estimand. This estimand will 
quantify the average treatment effect of a n employer-based WMP combined with medication for 
chronic weight management compared to the employer -based WMP alone after 12 months, in all 
randomized subjects and regardless of adherence to randomized treatment. 
The secondary estimand for body weight lo ss, categorical weight loss, and PROs is an “if all subjects 
had adhered” estimand. This estimand will quantify the average treatment effect of an employer -
based WMP combined with medication for chronic weight management compared to the employer-
based WMP alone after 12 months, in all randomized  subjects had they adhered to their randomized 
treatment for the entire planned study duration.
The primary endpoint is percent change in body weight from baseline (month 0) to month 12 (visit 
13). The study is designed to have 80% power to confirm superiority of WMP + Rx versus WMP 
alone on % weight change from baseline  (month 0) to month 12 (visit 13).
The full analysis set (FAS) comprising all randomize d subjects analyzed according to the treatment 
group to which they were assigned at randomization will be the analysis population for the evaluation 
of both the primary and secondary estimands. The primary estimand will be estimated based on the 
FAS and % weight change will be modeled using linear regression (Analysis of Covariance 
(ANCOVA) )with randomized treatment as a factor and baseline body weight (kg) as a covariate. 
Prior to analysis, missing month 12 weight data will be imputed by [CONTACT_43656]. For the 
secondary estimand, the primary endpoint w ill be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated 
measurements (MMRM) including all subjects, but for subjects considered non-adherent to 
randomized treatment, only data prior to non -adherence will be used.

Version 1.0; October 10, 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 12 of 57The significance level used in all statistical analyses will be 5% (two-sided).
Supplementary Analyses: A supplementary analysis will be conducted on the subset of subjects 
with month 12 (visit 13) body weight data who adhered to randomized treatment up to and including visit 13.
Secondary Analyses: Secondary analyses will compare WMP + Rx versus WMP in terms of 
categorical weight loss, adherence to the WMP, and PRO measures. Additionally, adherence to 
obesity medication will be descriptively summar ized for the WMP + Rx arm. The primary estimand 
will be assessed for all secondary endpoints. Additionally, the secondary estimand will be assessed 
for categorical weight loss and PRO measures.
Safety: For the purposes of this study, adverse events (AEs) will only be required to be collected if 
they meet the definition of an SAE. Study clinicians are r esponsible for reporting all SAEs and 
following the subject until the outcome of the event is closed out. All SAEs will be reported from 
randomization until EOS at month 12, or until the subject withdraws from the study. Study clinicians 
are also responsible for recording all pregnancies in female subjects from randomization until EOS at 
month [ADDRESS_45675]

The prevalence of obesity has been increasing globally based on pooled data from the years 1975 
to 2016. [1] In the [LOCATION_002] (US), nearly 40% of adults have obesity, with prevalence 
ranging from 22% to 38% among the different states. [2] Obesity raises the risk of morbidity 
from a multitude of diseases, including hypertensi on, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder diseas e, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, respi[INVESTIGATOR_43644], fatty liver disease, and some cancers. [ 3] [4] Obesity is also associated with increased 
risk of all-cause and cardiovascular diseases mortality. [5] In recognition of the biological basis 
and seriousness of obesity, several professional as sociations and health organizations worldwide
[4] [6] [7] [8] now recognize obesity as a disease. 
Lifestyle intervention in the form of improving diet and increasing physical activity is 
foundational treatment for obesity and overweight [9], but the majority of people with obesity 
and overweight struggle to achieve and maintain th eir weight loss. [10] Medications approved 
for chronic weight management can be useful adjunc ts to lifestyle change for patients who have 
been unsuccessful with diet and exercise alone. [11] Five medications have been approved by [CONTACT_43657] (FDA) for chro nic weight management: orlistat (per os (p.o.),
lorcaserin or lorcaserin extended-release (p.o.), phentermine/topi[INVESTIGATOR_43642]-release (p.o.),
naltrexone/bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_43643]-release (p.o.), lirag lutide 3.0 mg (subcutaneous (s.c.)).
In the US, employers are the ultimate purchasers of health care for the majority (56%) of 
Americans. [12] Recommendations support addressi ng obesity in the workplace; however, real-
world evidence of best practices for chronic weight management, including impact of longer-
term pharmacological treatment, in the employer context is lacking. [13] Currently, in order for 
medications for chronic weight management to be included in the health care offered to employees, employers have to “opt -in” or deliberately decide to pay for these medications for 
employees, even when payers have added them to their formulary. The Cleveland Clinic 
provides a unique environment to investigate th e impact of including approved medications for 
chronic weight management in the context of an employer-based weight management program. The Cleveland Clinic is one of the largest hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43645]. The Cleveland Clinic’s 
Employee Health Plan provides health coverage for approximately 66,[ADDRESS_45678] obesity defined by [CONTACT_43658] (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m
2, making the prevalence of obesity within 
the Cleveland Clinic Employee Health Plan consis tent with that observed in the general US adult 
population. [2] Cleveland Clinic’s Employee Health Plan provides employees diagnosed with
obesity support for participating in a weight management program of their choice, but does not currently offer coverage for medications for chronic weight management. One of the weight 
management programs offered to employees is the Cleveland Clinic’ s Integrated Medical Weight 
Management Program (WMP). This program is  administered through shared medical 
appointments (SMAs) which is a concept based on the chronic care model [14] that combines 
group appointments for patients with clinical intervention, consisting of encounters with a

As part of the comprehensive evaluation of a patient with obesity in which mood disorders and obstructive sleep apnea are common, at risk patients  are also referred to a mental health provider 
and/or sleep clinic.
The use of a pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) de sign aims to study the effects of a weight 
management program that includes treatment with medication for chronic weight management in an employer-based real-world setting while employing a prospective comparison between two 
randomly assigned interventions in employees with obesity. The two interventions included in 
this study are a weight management program combined with FDA approved medication for chronic weight management versus a weight  management program without medication for 
weight management. 
The key objective of the study is to demonstr ate the impact of including medication for chronic 
weight management in a real-world employer setting of an integrated medical weight management program.

weight management program in combination with medication for chronic weight management 
compared to an employer-based weight managem ent program alone in subjects with obesity on 
weight loss.
2.2 Secondary ObjectivesThe secondary objectives are to compare the eff ects of treatment with an employer-based weight 
management program in combination with medication for chronic weight management to an 
employer-based weight management program alone in subjects with obesity with regards to:
xCategorical weight loss
xAdherence to the weight management program
xPatient-reported outcomes (PROs) on wo rk productivity and work limitations
Furthermore, the secondary objectives will asse ss adherence to medication for chronic weight 
management (only in the treatment arm random ized to an employer-based chronic weight 
management program with medication for chronic weight management).

Cleveland Clinic’s existing Integrated Medical WMP combined with medication for chronic 
weight management versus Cleveland Clinic’s existing Integrat ed Medical WMP with no 
medication for weight management in subjects with obesity. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either Cleveland Clinic’s Integrated Me dical WMP with medication for chronic weight 
management (“WMP + Rx”) or Cleveland Clinic’s Integrated Medical WMP alone (“WMP”). 
To ensure that the study setting is as close to real-world as possible, the weight management 
program provided to all study subjects will be similar to the Integrated Medical WMP that is currently offered by [CONTACT_43650]. In this program, SMAs are covered by [CONTACT_43661] a co-payment. 
In the WMP + Rx arm, obesity medications approved by [CONTACT_43662] 5-[ADDRESS_45682] ion of specific medication is at the discretion 
of the study clinician. Subjects randomized to the WMP + Rx arm will pay a fee for the medication, simulating the co-payment that woul d be applied if the Health Plan covered 
treatment with medications for chronic weight management. 
Total study duration for the individual subjects will  be approximately one year. Subjects will be 
followed and data collection will continue for the full duration of the study, unless the subject 
withdraws informed consent. The full duration of the study is defined as up to and including visit 13.
Study visits include an individual screening and randomization visit (visit 1; informed consent 
must be obtained at visit 1 before screening), fo llowed by [CONTACT_43651]-monthly visits set up in 
the context of SMAs (visit 2 to visit 13; further  described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]). All subjects will be 
referred to a nutritionist appointment between vi sit 1 and visit 2. End of Study (EOS) is visit 13 
(month 12 (-14 days, +28 days)) (section 5.5). Effort  will be made to obtain a month 12 (visit 13) 
weight measurement from all randomized subjec ts. Subjects who potentially have stopped 
attending the SMAs prior to EOS will be encouraged to attend visit 13 for a weight measurement

4.2.1 Study Site
This is a single- center study conducted at the Clev eland Clinic’s Endocrinology and Metabolism 
Institute, Cleveland, Ohio.
4.2.[ADDRESS_45684] Recruitment and Eligibility
Eligible subjects include adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) enrolled in the Cleveland Clinic 
Employee Health Plan for whom treatment wi th medication for chronic weight management may
be indicated. Subjects must also meet all of the inclusion criteria (section 4.2.3) and none of the 
exclusion criteria (section 4.2.4). Inclusion and ex clusion criteria are minimally restrictive to 
ensure that a broad population of employees (and h ealth plan member spouses) with obesity is 
captured, in order to generate data on a heteroge neous population that reflects a real-world 
population in scope for employer-based weight  management programs, and support the study 
objectives of evaluating the impact of including medication for chronic weight management in a 
real-world employer-based integrated  chronic weight management program.
To preserve the real-world nature of the st udy, potential subjects will be approached for 
enrollment into the study in a manner consistent with how health plan members are approached for participation in the Integrated Medical WMP as  part of Healthy Choice, the wellness program 
benefit for Cleveland Clinic Employee Health P lan subscribers and their spouses. Members of 
Cleveland Clinic Employee Health Plan receiv e an annual end-of-year communication via e-
mail/US mail with notification of the Healthy C hoice status of both the employee and spouse (if 
applicable) and enrollment instructions. If an  employee or spouse has one of qualifying chronic 
diseases (asthma, diabetes, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, tobacco use, or overweight), he/she is 
eligible for the Healthy Choice program only if he/she joins the disease management program for 
that diagnosis.
The Integrated Medical WMP employed in this st udy is one of the weight management programs 
offered to health plan members with obesity via the Healthy Choice program. Health plan 
members identified as eligible for one  of Cleveland Clinic’s employer -based weight management 
programs will be invited to attend an informational session and will be approached for potential 
enrollment into the study. If he/she decides to participate in the Integrated Medical WMP and is
interested in the study, the prospective subject will be scheduled for a screening and 
randomization visit (i.e., study visit 1) with a study clinician. If he/she chooses not to participate 
in the study, it will not have any implicati ons for the employee, and he/she may join the 
Integrated Medical WMP or other weight management programs offered to health plan members with obesity via the Healthy Choice program.

options: protein-sparing modified fast, Mediterranea n, or meal replacement. Subjects will then be 
referred to a nutritionist appointment. Consistent with real-world implementation of the WMP, the subject’s diet choice will be at the discretion of the subject  and subjects will be free to change 
their diet choice throughout participation in the WMP.
Subjects will then initiate a series of twelve monthly study visits in the context of SMAs with up 
to approximately [ADDRESS_45692] and will be approximately 90 minu tes in length. The 5 components of the WMP will 
be reviewed at every SMA and include: nutrition, physical activity, appetite control, sleep issues, 
and anxiety/depression/stress. SMA content will focus on accomplishing a healthier lifestyle,

also be referred to a mental he alth specialist and/or sleep clinic.
Subjects in the two treatment arms will be allo cated to separate SMA groups according to their 
randomized intervention (WMP + Rx versus WMP). In addition, effort will be made to keep the 
initial assigned SMA groups intact for the dur ation of the study for continuity of SMA 
participants (subjects and providers) month to month. All subjects will be responsible for paying 
the SMA monthly co-payment, as currently requi red by [CONTACT_43666]. Consistent with usual practice, subjects w ill be eligible for reimbursement of their SMA 
co-payments if they are compliant with thei r treatment plan according to the pre-defined 
Cleveland Clinic Health Plan criteria for we ight management SMAs (attend SMAs, have a 
realistic personalized (based on BMI) weight loss  goal set, demonstrate actual weight loss during 
each quarter, adhere to any medications etc.).
[IP_ADDRESS] Obesity medication (WMP + Rx arm only)
After randomization, subjects randomized to the WMP + Rx arm will initiate treatment with 
prescription medication indicated for chronic weight management (obesity medication). The 
prescription will be provided at the time of ra ndomization (visit 1) as agreed between the study 
clinician and the subject, and this and any moni toring, counseling or follow-up will be consistent 
with usual clinical practice and standard of car e. Medication choice, dose, and dose escalation 
will be at the discretion of the study clinicia n among those medications indicated for chronic 
weight management (Table 5-1). Only medications approved by [CONTACT_43667]; all other medications for the purpose of weight management, on- or off-label, are not allowed.
Subjects in the WMP + Rx arm may switch to another obesity medication (switch), temporarily 
discontinue (suspend), or permanently discont inue (discontinue) obesity medication throughout 
the study according to standard clinical practice at  the discretion of the study clinician. If a 
subject chooses to suspend or discontinue his/her obesity medication, he/she will be asked tonotify the study clinician of his/her decision to en sure a safe withdrawal. In case of an obesity 
medication discontinuation, subjects will be encoura ged to initiate treatment with another obesity 
medication (i.e., to switch) at the discretion of the study clinician according to routine practice.

v2.0 (WPAI:SHP)
The WPAI:SHP questionnaire (Appendix 2- 1) assesses both work productivity through 
absenteeism (i.e., work time missed), presenteeism (i.e., impairment at work or reduced on-the-
job effectiveness), and work productivity loss, as well as daily activity impairment (e.g., work 
around the house, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], exercising, childcare,  studying) attributable to excess weight. 
WPAI:SHP outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher scores indicating 
greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes.
[IP_ADDRESS] Work Limitations Questionnaire 8-Item (WLQ-8) Self-administered Short Form 
The WLQ-8 questionnaire (Appendix 2-2) assesses th e degree to which subjects have difficulty 
related to time management, physical tasks, men tal/interpersonal tasks, and output tasks due to 
their physical and/or emotional health. The WLQ-8 produces subscale scores as well as an index 
of overall at-work productivity loss. WLQ-8 outcomes are expressed as proportion time with 
difficulty, with higher scores indicating greater limitations, i.e., worse outcomes.
5.4 Study PeriodSubjects will be followed from baseline (month 0) to EOS at month 12 (visit 13), during which 
study clinicians or trained site personnel will collect study data and record them in the eCRF 
during monthly SMA study visits, including: weight as measured on a designated calibrated 
scale, pregnancy and serious a dverse events (SAEs) (section 7), attendance at SMAs, and use of 
disallowed medications (section [IP_ADDRESS]). PRO questi onnaires will be completed as described in 
section 5.3. (Appendix 1-1)
Other than withdrawal of consent, subjects will remain in the study, and effort will be made to 
obtain a month 12 (visit 13) weight measurement from all randomized subjects regardless of SMA attendance or obesity treatment discontinua tion during the study period. If a subject stops 
attending SMAs prior to EOS, he/she will be encouraged to attend visit 13 for a weight 
measurement within the visit window. Subjects who come back for a visit 13 weight 
measurement will also be asked to complete the PRO questionnaires during the visit and to report SAEs or disallowed medication use.
5.5 End of Study (EOS)EOS is defined as 12 months (-14 days, +28 days) after baseline.
If a subject does not attend visit 13, a stepwise approach to obtaining weight will be 
implemented according to the following hierarchy:
1. Subject called into office for month 12 weight measurement (-14 days, +28 days from 
scheduled month 12/visit 13).
2. Recent (-14 days, +28 days from scheduled month 12/visit 13) weight extracted from the 
electronic medical record (EMR).

5.7.2 Subjects
Participation in the study is voluntary, and all subjec ts are free to withdraw his/her consent at any 
time. A subject will only be withdrawn from the study if he/she withdraws consent. In the event 
of study withdrawal, the study clinician will record the reason for study withdrawal and continue 
to follow-up with the subject as medically indicated for any unresolved SAEs or pregnancies, if 
subject agrees. Upon subject consent withdrawal from the study, all data collection will end, but
all study data collected up to withdrawal will be included in the study database.
6 STATISTICAL METHODS
6.1 Analysis OverviewSubjects will be randomized 1:1 to WMP + Rx or WMP alone. The data analyses for this study 
will be outlined in further detail in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
The significance level used in all statist ical analyses will be 5% (two-sided).

Primary estimand
The primary estimand for all endpoints is an “intention -to-treat” estimand (also known as an 
“effectiveness” or a “treatment pol icy” estimand). This estimand will qua ntify the average 
treatment effect of an employer-based WMP co mbined with medication for chronic weight

subjects and regardless of adherence to randomized treatment. 
Secondary estimand 
The secondary estimand for body weight loss, cate gorical weight loss, and PROs is an “if all 
subjects had adhered” estimand (also known as  an “efficacy” estimand). This estimand will 
quantify the average treatment effect of an empl oyer-based WMP combined with medication for 
chronic weight management compared to the employer-based WMP alone after 12 months, in all 
randomized subjects had they adhered to their ra ndomized treatment for the entire planned study 
duration as defined in Section 6.4.3.
6.1.2 Primary Endpoint and Confirming Hypothesis
The primary endpoint is percent change in body weight from baseline (month 0) to month 12 
(visit 13), as defined:
% weight change =body weight at visit 13 –body weight at baseline
x 100%body weight at baseline
where a negative value indicates a body weight loss from baseline (month 0) to month 12 (visit 13).
One confirmatory hypothesis will be tested:
xSuperiority of WMP + Rx versus WMP alone on % weight change from baseline (month 
0) to month 12 (visit 13).
The test will be evaluated as a two-sided test of the null hypothesis that the mean weight change 
(%) in the two treatment arms is the same (H
0: % weight change [WMP + Rx] = % weight 
change [WMP]). Superiority will be claimed if th e two-sided p-value is less than 5% and the 
estimated difference in mean weight change favors WMP + Rx (H a: % weight change [WMP + 
Rx] < % weight change [WMP]).
6.2 Study PopulationsThe following analysis sets will be defined:Full analysis set (FAS) : Includes all randomized subjects analyzed according to the treatment

oRetrieved and non-retrieved drop outs in  the WMP arm are assumed to have the 
same effect as subjects who complete the WMP arm.
oNon-retrieved drop outs in the WMP + Rx arm are assumed to have an effect 
corresponding to subjects in the WMP arm.
oRetrieved drop outs in the WMP + Rx arm are assumed to have an effect 
corresponding to half the weight loss difference (compared to WMP) of subjects who complete the study in the WMP + Rx arm. 
xThe following expected distribution of prescriptions in the WMP + Rx arm (based on 
input from the Cleveland Clinic):

o30% Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_43643]-release (Contrave®)
o30% Liraglutide 3.0 mg (Saxenda®)
Table 6-1 presents several sample size scen arios and power calculations based on the above 
assumptions, varying expected mean difference s in weight loss between treatment arms 
(treatment effect) over [ADDRESS_45695] dev iations (SD) as the variation of weight loss 
between subjects within the same treatment arm.  Treatment effect scenarios of 3, 3.5, 4, and 5% 
were chosen based on product labels. SD of  8, 9, 10, and 11 % were chosen based on the

factor and baseline body weight (kg) as a covari ate. The treatment difference between WMP + 
Rx and WMP alone will be estimated and reported together with the associated 95% confidence 
interval (CI) and corresponding p-value.
6.4.1 Primary Estimand Missing Data Imputation
Prior to analysis, missing month 12 weight data will be imputed by [CONTACT_43656]. For the 
primary analysis, missing month 12 weight data will be imputed by [CONTACT_43671] 13 in the WMP arm (incl uding values from retrieved drop outs). This 
approach is al so known as “jump to reference” and makes the assumption that subjects instantly 
lose any effect of randomized treatment beyond what can be expected from the WMP after

(visit 13) are not used for this imputation appro ach. Imputation details will be further described 
in the SAP. 
6.4.2 Sensitivity Analysis of the Primary Estimand for the Primary Endpoint
A multiple imputation approach as described by [CONTACT_43672] [22] will be used as sensitivity 
analysis. In this approach, month [ADDRESS_45697] available body weight. If this approach is not 
feasible, no sensitivity analysis will be done.
6.4.3 Secondary Estimand for the Primary Endpoint
The secondary estimand of the primary endpoint will address the efficacy of medication for 
chronic weight management if all subjects adhere  to their randomized treatment (WMP + Rx or 
WMP). For the secondary estimand, the primary endpoi nt will be analyzed using a mixed model 
for repeated measurements (MMRM) including all subjects, but for subjects considered non-adherent to randomized treatment, only data pr ior to non-adherence will be used. Month 12 (visit 
13) assessments for retrieved drop outs will not be used in this analysis. The MMRM for efficacy 
will only use assessments from subjects who are adherent to the randomized treatment until end 
of treatment, or up until the subject is considered  non-adherent to the randomized treatment. 
Subjects in the WMP arm will be considered non-adherent if/when criterion 1 below is met. 
Subjects in the WMP + Rx arm will be consider ed non-adherent if/when cr iterion 1 or 2 is met: 
1. Missing [ADDRESS_45698] assessment. Th is is also the case if, e.g., 4 SMA visits in a 
row are missed. 
2. Period with no coverage of prescriptio n claims according to PDC exceeds 20% of 
planned medication duration, or number of days from visit 1 to visit 13. For subjects that 
drop out early, the expected visit 13 date (derived from the subjects’ planned SMA group visit) will be used to calculate planned study duration. The last assessment made prior to exceeding 20% of planned study duration with no prescription claims will be used as last 
assessment.
The MMRM for efficacy will be fitted using % weight change with randomized treatment as 
factor and baseline body weight (kg) as covariate,  all nested within visit. An unstructured 
covariance matrix for measurements within the same subject will be employed, assuming that 
measurements for different subjects are independent.
6.4.4 Supplementary Analyses
The analyses of % weight change will be suppl emented with a completer analysis based on the 
subset of subjects with month 12 (visit 13) body weight data who were adherent to the 
randomized treatment.

Version 1.0; October 10, 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 32 of 57Completer analysis 
In the context of this supplementary analysis, completers will be defined as subjects with month 
12 (visit 13) body weight data who adhered to randomized treatment up to and including visit 13. 
Adherence is defined as for the secondary es timand for the primary endpoint in section 6.4.3, 
i.e., subjects in the WMP arm will be consider ed non-adherent if/when criterion 1 above is met 
and subjects in the WMP + Rx arm will be considered non-adherent if/when either criterion [ADDRESS_45699] in the WMP + Rx arm that misses visit 10, 11, and 12, 
but attends all other visits and is covered by [CONTACT_43673] 80% of the planned 
study duration, is considered a completer in this context if month 12 (visit 13) weight data are available.
This analysis will use the same ANCOVA model described for the primary estimand analysis of 
the primary endpoint (section 6.4).
6.5 Primary Estimand for the Secondary EndpointsThe following analyses are planned to further support the primary objective to compare weight 
loss of WMP + Rx versus WMP. They will also address the secondary objectives of this study to 
compare WMP + Rx versus WMP with respect to categorical weight loss, WMP adherence, and 
PROs, as well as adherence to obesity medication within the WMP + Rx cohort.
All secondary analyses described in this sectio n will be the primary estimand based on the FAS. 
No sensitivity analyses are planned for the secondary endpoints.
6.5.1 Categorical Weight Loss
For the categorical weight loss endpoints ( ≥5% weight reduction from baseline, ≥10% weight 
reduction from baseline), the proportion of subjects achieving each endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with treatment as  categorical effect and baseline weight (kg) as 
covariate. From the model, the estimated odds ratio (OR) (WMP + Rx / WMP) will be presented 
with the 95% CI and p-value. An OR above 1 favors WMP + Rx. Missing weight data will be 
imputed as described for the primary esti mand for the primary endpoint (section 6.4.1).
6.5.2 Adherence to Weight Management Program (WMP)
WMP adherence will be assessed through SMA at tendance endpoints. SMA attendance will be 
reported as the percentage planned SMAs attended, i.e., number of SMAs attended/12 planned 
SMAs. SMA attendance and the proportion of subjects achieving ≥9 SMAs will be descriptively 
summarized by [CONTACT_2939]. No formal  statistical testing will be conducted. 
6.5.3 Adherence to Obesity Medication
Adherence to obesity medication will be assessed through PDC (to be defined in the SAP) for the 
WMP + Rx treatment arm only. The PDC and the proportion of subjects with at least 80% PDC 
will be descriptively summarized for the WMP + Rx  treatment arm. No formal statistical testing 
will be conducted.

Work productivity and work limitations will  be assessed by [CONTACT_43674]:SHP and WLQ-8
instruments (section 5.3.1). Analysis of change from baseline (month 0) to month 12 (visit 13) in 
work productivity and work limitation endpoints defined in section 3.2 will follow the method 
described for the primary estimand for the pr imary endpoint: ANCOVA model with randomized 
treatment as a factor and baseline value of the endpoint variable as covariate. Estimated 
difference (WMP + Rx minus WMP) in change from baseline (month 0) to month 12 (visit 13) 
will be presented with 95% CI and corresponding p-value. If examination of the data indicate 
that it is not justifiable to model data base d on assumptions of normality, e.g., many responses of 
0% or close to 0%, alternative statistical modeling will be used (e.g. logistic regression after 
definition of a responder limit).
6.5.5 Supplementary Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Analysis
As a supplementary PRO analysis, the PRO analysis described in section 6.5.4 will be repeated 
for change from baseline (month 0) to month 6 (visit 7) in work productivity and work limitation endpoints.
6.6 Secondary Estimand for the Secondary Endpoints
Categorical WeightThe secondary estimand for the categorical weight e ndpoint of ≥ 5% reduction in body weight 
from baseline (5% responder) will be assessed using the MMRM for efficacy as described for the 
secondary estimand for the primary endpoint in se ction 6.4.3. Analysis will only use assessments 
from subjects who are adherent to the randomized  treatment until end of treatment, or up until 
the subject is considered non-adherent to the randomized treatment. From the MMRM, individually predicted values for % weight change  at month [ADDRESS_45700] as 5% responder or not. This classificati on will then be analyzed using a logistic 
regression model with treatment as the only factor. From the model, the estimated OR (WMP + 
Rx / WMP) will be presented with the 95% CI and p-value.
PROsThe secondary estimand for change from baseline (month 0) to month 12 (visit 13) in work 
productivity and work limitation endpoints (section 3.2) will be assessed using the MMRM for 
efficacy as described for the secondary esti mand for the primary endpoint in section 6.4.3. The
MMRM for efficacy will only use PRO assessments from subjects who are adherent to the 
randomized treatment until end of treatment, or up until the subject is considered non-adherent to 
the randomized treatment. The MMRM for efficacy w ill be fitted using change in PRO endpoint 
with randomized treatment as fact or and baseline value of the endpoi nt variable as covariate, all 
nested within visit. An unstructured covariance  matrix for measurements within the same subject 
will be employed, assuming that measurements  for different subjects are independent.

6.7 Safety Analysis
SAEs will be collected as described in section 7. No formal safety analyses are planned for this 
study. SAEs will be coded using Medical Dicti onary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and 
descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT).
7 ADVERSE EVENT (AE) REPORTING
7.1 Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product or medical device, which doe s not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship to the product or device. Worsening of existing medical conditions, if considered 
serious and related by [CONTACT_093], should be reported as AEs.
For the purposes of this study, AEs will only be required to be collected if they meet the 
definition of an SAE (section 7.2).
7.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)All AEs meeting the definition of SAE will be collected. An SAE is defined as any AE which 
results in at least one of the following outcomes:
xInitial inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43649]-threatening event, i.e., an event in which the subject was at immediate risk of 
dying at the time of the event; not an event that hypothetically could have caused death had it been more severe
xPersistent or significant disability or incapacity
xCongenital anomaly or birth defect in offspring
xDeath
xIs deemed serious for any other reason, i.e., if it is an important medical event based on 
appropriate medical judgement which may je opardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other listed outcomes.
7.2.1 Reporting Period of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
SAEs will be reported from randomization until EOS at month 12, or until the subject withdraws 
from the study. Study clinicians will follow SAEs that occur in any subject during this study in a 
manner consistent with routine clinical practice.

hours of becoming aware of it via electronic data capture (EDC) entry. The subject should be followed until the outcome of the event is closed out. Follow-up information should be reported 
within [ADDRESS_45701], these should be reported as spontaneous events.
7.3 Pregnancy
Any abnormal pregnancy outcome (e.g., spontaneous miscarriage, fetal death, congenital 
anomaly/birth defect, etc.) is considered an SA E. For the purposes of this study, any pregnancies 
in participating female subjects will be report ed, along with pregnancy outcome and any AEs or 
SAEs observed in the fetus or newborn until [ADDRESS_45702]'s pregnancy. The subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The study physician will 
collect follow-up information on subject and neona te, which will be forwarded to Novo Nordisk. 
Any termination of pregnancy should be reporte d, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence 
of anomalies) or indication for procedure. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and should be reported as such.

Reporting
 
Assessment of Causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between trial product and the occurrence
of each AE/SAE.
Relationship between an AE/SAE and the relev ant trial product(s) should be assessed as:
xProbable: Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship.
xPossible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed.
xUnlikely: The event is most likely related to etiology other than the trial product.
Alternative etiology, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant medication, and other risk
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of th e event to trial product administration will be
considered and investigated.
The investigator should use the individual product information for the assessment. For each 
AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the me dical records that he/she has reviewed the 
AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal
information to include in the initial report. However, it is important that the investigator
always makes an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of 
the SAE data.
The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and
send a follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
The causality assessment is one of the criteri a used when determining regulatory reporting
requirements.
Final Outcome
The investigator will select the most appropriate outcome:
xRecovered/resolved: The subject has fully recovered, or by [CONTACT_36303]-related activity after the 
subject signed the informed consent.
xRecovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover 
from the event. This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has 
died from another AE.

Version 1.0; October 10, 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 57 of 57xRecovered/resolved with sequelae: The subject has recovered from the condition, but
with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequelae meets an 
SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE.
xNot recovered/not resolved: The condition of the subject has not improved and the
symptoms are unchanged or the outcome is not known.
xFatal: This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the
reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be
assessed as “recovered/resolve d,” “recovering/resolving ,” “recovered/resolved with
sequelae, ” or “not recovered/not resolved .” An AE with a fatal outcome must be reported
as an SAE.
xUnknown: This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up.

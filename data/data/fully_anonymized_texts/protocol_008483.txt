2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
TT301/MW189 (hereafter called MW189) is a small molecule drug candidate developed as a 
selective suppressor of disease and injury -induced glia proinflammatory cytokine 
overproduction associated with destructive glia inflammation/neuron dysfunction cycles, and 
their long -term neurotoxic effects. MW189 treatment attenuates the stressor -induced rise in 
brain proinflammatory cytokine levels with a downstream improvement in behavior dysfunction 
and synaptic dysfunction markers in multiple animal models of CNS di sorders where up -
regulation of proinflammatory molecules is implicated in disease progression. MW189 is being 
developed for the treatment of acute brain injuries such as traumatic brain injury or 
intracerebral hemorrhage. The development program is based o n nonclinical evidence that 
MW189 reduces the recruitment of activated microglia, reduces cerebral edema, and improves 
motor skills and neurocognitive outcomes in animal models of neuroinflammatory disorders.  
 
The present study will provide safety and pha rmacokinetic (PK) information on multiple 
ascending doses (MAD) of MW189 to support decisions for continued clinical development. This 
study will assess the safety, tolerability, a nd PK profile  of escalating  repeated doses of MW189  
in healthy adult partici pants. The trial design  will be a double -blind, placebo -controlled, MAD  
study of MW189  in healthy volunteers.  Three dosing cohorts  are initially planned.  All subjects 
and the study personnel responsible for assessing adverse  events (AEs) will be blinded.  
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) provides a more technical and detailed elaboration of the 
statistical analyses of safety and tolerability data as outlined and/or specified in the most re cent 
amendment of the protocol .  
 
In the study design, 32 healthy  male and female volunteers, ages 18 -50 years, will be dosed in 
1 of 4 dosing cohorts of 8 subjects each (6 MW189, 2 matched placebo). Subjects will be 
admitted to the Phase 1 unit on the day prior to dosing (Day -1) and will remain in the clinical 
researc h unit until discharge on Day 8.  Follow -up will be done through a clinic visit at 2 weeks 
and a phone call 4 weeks from end of dosing.  
 
Subjects will receive 2 doses per day for 5 consecutive days. Doses will be given 12 hours 
apart.  
Cohort 1 : 0.075 mg/kg  MW189  iv bid over 20 minutes (or matched placebo)  
Cohort 2 : 0.15 mg/kg  MW189  iv bid over 20 minutes (or matched placebo)  
Cohort 3 : 0.30 mg/kg  MW189  iv bid over 20 minutes (or matched placebo)  
Cohort 4: 0.25 mg/kg  MW189  iv bid over 20 minutes (or matched placebo)  (added after protocol 
amendment)  
 
Dose levels selected for the MAD study at 0.075 mg/kg, 0.15 mg/kg , 0.25 mg/kg,  and 0.30 
mg/kg twice daily for [ADDRESS_421825] will receive 1 iv dose level of 
MW189 twice daily ( bid) on Days [ADDRESS_421826] 
completed the study through the clinic visit at 2 weeks, data will be collected for the safety 
review. Dosing of Cohort 2 will proceed upon joint re commendation by [CONTACT_340774], after reviewing Cohort 1’s safety data including AEs, SAEs, vital signs, safety 
laboratory tests and ECGs. Dosing of Cohort 3 will proceed upon joint recommendation by [CONTACT_340775], after reviewing Cohort 2’s safety data including AEs, SAEs, vital 
University of Kentucky   Page [ADDRESS_421827] (DSMB).  The maximum dose in this study 
will not exceed 0.30 mg/kg bid. Any changes to dosing will be m ade during the safety review.  
 
Screening  will be conducted within [ADDRESS_421828] will undergo a medical screen consisting of the following procedures: 
demographics; medical history; concomitant me dication review; body temperature; 12 -lead 
ECG; vital signs; physical exam ; alcohol and drug screen; Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, and TB 
screens; and  safety laboratory work and pregnancy testing.  
 
One day prior to dosing (Day -1), subjects will be admitted to the Duke Early Phase Research 
Unit ( DEPRU ) Phase 1 unit for final qualification assessments. These assessments will include 
inclusion/exclusion review, medical history, physical exam, infection  screen, body temperature, 
alcohol and drug screen, vital signs, pregnancy test, neurological exam, and safety laboratory 
tests.  
 
Dosing will be twice daily, starting on Day [ADDRESS_421829] of safety lab work , body temperature, ECG, vital signs, concomitant medication review , 
and assessment of adverse events ( AEs). The follow -up phone call will include a concomitant 
medication review, and assess ment of  any safety issues.

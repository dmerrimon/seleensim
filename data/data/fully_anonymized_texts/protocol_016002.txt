HRP-593 / v121917OBJECTIVES:
To provide  information about human subcutaneous fat thickness at different anatomic sites on 
the body by (1) measuring these thicknesses with a diagnostic ultrasound and also by (2) 
correlating patient perceptions of body image with measured fat distribution.  The information 
obtained can useful in clarifying: (1) age, gender, and racial differences in subcutaneous fat 
accumulation that may inform patient education and (2) help us better understand which 
procedures may be better for particular patients.
BACKGROUND: (flesh  out and refs)
High-frequency ultrasound  allows for non-invasive assessment of physiological and pathological 
aspects of the integumentary system.1 Although classical ultrasound (7.5-10 MHz) is not 
commonly used in dermatology, ultrasonography with frequencies of at least [ADDRESS_1190803] been no studies investigating relevant anatomy of the body using 
ultrasound technology for fat measurement and how this corresponds to patient perceptions of 
their body. This study seeks to remedy this deficiency. 
STUDY ENDPOINTS :
The primary  endpoints are the descriptive differences seen fat measurements taken with a 
diagnostic ultrasound, and the correlating the measurements with patient perceptions of body 
image with a questionnaire.
STUDY INTERVENTION(S)   / INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT(S):
Drug/Device Handling:  LOGIQ P6 Diagnostic Ultrasound (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI). 
Only trained and authorized personnel will operate the ultrasound.  The microscope will be 
stored in a locked space in the Department of Dermatology at [ADDRESS_1190804] of care gel used when obtaining ultrasound images: 
AQUASONIC® 100  ULTRASOUND TRANSMISSION GEL (Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, NJ).
This gel  and device is being used per the FDA approved use for imaging and there is no 
investigational use. This device is a non-significant risk device.

expressing an interest in study participation will be contact[CONTACT_855087] a 
verbal explanation and discussion of the protocol.
Printed  and electronic advertisements will be posted on the Northwestern University

COMPENSATION FOR  PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH ACTIVITIES
 Participants  will receive a $[ADDRESS_1190805]  no longer qualifies based on inclusion/exclusion criteria
-Adverse  events occur that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], put the subject at increased 
risk and it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue the study
RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS
Photographs:
There is  a possibility that subjects will be able to be identified from the photographs that 
will be taken for the study. 
Ultrasound:
There is  a possibility that subjects will be able to be identified from the ultrasound 
images that will be taken for the study.

HRP-593 / v121917Allowing the  machine to transmit acoustic output with the probe not in use (or in its 
holder) can cause the transducer to build up heat.  The probe therefore may be warm on 
the skin.
The use of damaged  probes can result in injury or increased risk of infection. A damaged 
probe can also increase the risk of electric shock if conductive solutions come in contact 
[CONTACT_855089]. 
Ultrasound can  produce harmful effects in tissue and potentially result in patient injury. 
Exposure time will be minimized per area and ultrasound levels will be kept low when 
there is no medical benefit.
Ultrasound Gel:  
There is  a possibility that the ultrasound gel can cause skin irritation or skin allergic 
reactions.
POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO  PARTICIPANTS
There is  no direct benefit to the participant. The knowledge gained from this study could provide 
valuable information about anatomical fat measurements and how this corresponds to patient 
perceptions of their body..
DATA MANAGEMENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY
Statistical Analysis
Deidentified study  data will be into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet by [CONTACT_855090]. This is a descriptive study and no statistics will be performed other than any 
descriptive statistics. Power study and sample size were not performed since this is a 
descriptive study with descriptive analysis.
Data Storage
The study  team will enter subject data into a spreadsheet and/or eCRFs that will be accessible 
to IRB authorized site personnel through a secure internet connection immediately after entry.  
Subject data will be de-identified; each subject will be given a unique identifier code and an 
additional spreadsheet with the unique identifier codes will be maintained on password 
protected computers, in password protected network folders. Data, photos, and ultrasound 
images will be stored in a secure drive (FSM Research Files drive) which is maintained by 
[CONTACT_78143].  Paper source documents will be kept in the department office in a 
locked file cabinet.  Access to locked cabinets will be granted only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_855084].  After study completion; all study documentation, including regulatory 
documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_1495], signed informed consent forms will be kept on-site in a secure 
locked cabinet for at least one month.  Study documents may be shipped after one month to 
Iron Mountain, an off-site record storage/management facility.  All study records are indefinitely 
stored per Iron Mountain’s policies and procedure.  Data generated as a result of this study are 
to be available for inspection on request by [CONTACT_855091] (IRB).
PROVISIONS TO  PROTECT THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS
Participants have the  right to be treated with respect, including respect for their decision 
whether or not they wish to continue or stop being in the study. They are free to choose to stop 
being in the study at any time.

Version #:   1.1 Version Date: 9-28-18 Page 6 of 8
HRP-593 / v121917Choosing not to  be in the study or to stop being in this study will not result in any penalty to 
them or loss of benefit to which they are entitled. Specifically, their choice not to be in this study 
will not negatively affect their right to any present or future medical treatment or present or 
future employment to which they are otherwise entitled.
ECONOMIC BURDEN  TO PARTICIPANTS
Subjects will be  responsible for transportation costs, although they will be offered parking 
validation to partially cover parking expenses at the treatment site. 
CONSENT PROCESS
Prior to  performing any research procedures, consent for participation will be obtained in writing 
by [CONTACT_855092] a consent form by [CONTACT_855093] a quiet room (e.g. the exam room) at 
the study site. The consent form will be read by [CONTACT_855094]. Approximately 
[ADDRESS_1190806]’s signed consent 
form will be retained in the study file. 
Only authorized  personnel that have been listed in the application as being involved in consent 
will have a role in consent.  
PROTECTED HEALTH  INFORMATION (PHI AND HIPAA)
We are  committed to respect participant privacy and to keep their personal information 
confidential. Personal health information from their medical records and information that can 
identify them may be used. For example, personal health information may include name, 
address, phone number or e-mail address.
The health information  we may collect and use for this research may include the following:
all information  in a medical record,
results  of physical examinations,
medical  history,
lab  tests, or certain health information indicating or relating to a particular condition as 
well as diaries and questionnaires,
records  about study medication or drugs,
records  about study devices.
During this  study, the participant may be coming to the Northwestern Memorial Healthcare 
Corporation (NMHC) clinical offices for research appointments or to get clinical services, such 
as lab tests, needed for the study. When that happens, they will be scheduled for these services 
through the NMHC computer system. When a clinical exam or lab is done by [CONTACT_855095], that information will be kept in both 
NMHC's clinical records and in the study records.
Subject medical information  obtained during this study is considered confidential and disclosure 
to their parties other than the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_5773]-investigators is prohibited. All 
reports and communications relating to subjects in this study will identify each subject only by 
[CONTACT_855096]. Medical information resulting from a subject’s 
participation in this study may be given to the subject’s personal physician or to the appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the subject’s welfare. Data generated as a result of this study

12 (68 )1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Serum  potassi um (K) is ti ghtly regulated, typi[INVESTIGATOR_32270] 3.5 and 5.0 mmo l/L. Homeostatic
maintenance of serum potassium is important for many physio logic processes, such as cardiac 
conduction and inotropy , smooth m uscle tone, and n euronal  signaling. 
Hyperkalemia is defined as an abnormally high serum potassium (S -K) concentration, usually 
greater than 5.0 mmo l/L, and with an incidence of up to 10% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], and 2 -
3% in the general populat ion (Mahoney 2005, Kovesdy 2014).  Potassi um homeostasis is 
essent ial for maintaining the cellular membrane potential and proper neuromuscular 
funct ioning, and hyperkalemia impairs neuro muscular, cardiac, and gastrointestinal funct ion.  
Hyperkalemia often presents without symptoms or with non-specific symptom s incl uding 
malaise, confusio n, muscle weakness or signs of cardiac arrhy thmias (Henneman 2016).  The 
risk of fatal cardiac arrhy thmias is increased, especially  at S-K levels above 6.0 mmo l/L, and 
the mortali ty risk is increased a lso wi th modest el evations of S-K (Collins 2014, Nakhoul 
2015).
Potassi um homeostasi s is essent ial for maintaining the cellular membrane potential and 
hyperkalemia causes electrophysio logical  disturbance which impairs neuromuscular, cardiac 
and gastrointes tinal funct ion.  The m ost comm on underlying cause of hyperkalemia is 
decreased urinary potassium excret ion due to reduced kidney funct ion, as in pat ients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF), or due to pharmaco logic treatm ents, 
such as renin angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) (Einhorn et al 2009, Fleet et al 2012, 
Kovesdy  2015). As the underlying causes of hyperkalemia are often chronic condit ions that 
worsen over time, there is a need for treatments not only for the correction o f hyperkal emia 
into the normal range (S -K 3.5- 5.0 mmo l/L) but also for chronic treatment to maintain S -K 
within the normal range.
Sodium zirconium  cycl osilicate (ZS) i s a non -absorbed, inorganic cry stalline co mpound that 
select ively captures potassium ions in exchange for sodium and hydrogen ions in the 
gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.  Thereby , excess potassi um is rem oved from the 
body  through faecal excretion and serum potassium is decreased.  A global clinical 
programme including more th an [ADDRESS_1152479] ive 
correcti on of  hyperkalemia wit h ZS compared wit h placebo, where 88% of patients reached 
norm al S-K after 48 hours of treatment with ZS 10 g three times a day  [TID]).  Maintenance 
of norm okalemia was also dem onstrated, wi th lower m ean S -K and increased number of 
norm okalemic days with ZS 5 g or 10 g once daily (QD) compared with placebo, and a last ing 
maintenance effect for up to 12 months.   
The ki dney plays a major role in eliminat ing potassium. Patients with end -stage renal disease 
(ESRD) have reduced renal potassium excret ion abilit y which frequent ly leads to 
hyperkalemia (K > 5.1 mmo l/L). These pati ents depend on the administration of renal 
replacement therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g. hem odialysis including low K dialysates as necessary ), dietary

13(68)potassi um restri ction, and occasio nally the use of oral potassium binding resins to maintain 
serum  potassi um levels in a physio logic range (Luo 2016, Kovesdy 2007).
High serum  potassi um can l ead to ventri cular arrhy thmias and cardiac death. Recent studies 
have shown that among pat ients with ESRD on hemodialysis therapy, serum K > 5.6 mmo l/L 
is associated with i ncreased mortalit y, both all-cause and cardio vascular, compared to a 
referent category  of K levels between 4.6 to 4.99 mmo l/L (Kovesdy 2007, Yusuf 2016). In 
addition, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading cause of death in hemodialysis pat ients. In 
the[LOCATION_002] Renal Data Sy stem  (USRDS) database, 26.9% of all -cause mortalit ies in 
prevalent dialysis pat ients between [ADDRESS_1152480] or 
arrhy thmias. The incidence of SCD in hemodialysis patients was 49.2 per 1000 patient -years 
in 2011, which is much higher than that of the general populat ion (Huang 2015). 
Hyperkalemia is considered an important risk factor for arrhy thmias and SCD. This condit ion 
is also independent ly associated with greater short -term risk of hospi [INVESTIGATOR_830373], and wi th greater hospi [INVESTIGATOR_15680] (Brunelli 2017). Hence prevent ion and 
treatm ent of hyperkalemia in hemodialysis pat ients are of paramount importance.
Previous studies wit h ZS have demo nstrated efficacy  and safet y in the treatm ent of 
hyperkalemia, but hemodialysis pat ients were excluded. The study  is designed to evaluate the 
efficacy  and safety  of ZS in hyperkalemic ESRD patients on hemodialysis and to determine 
the appropriate ZS dosing regimen in this pat ient populat ion.
1.[ADDRESS_1152481] i s dialysis including low K dialysates as necessary (hem o-or peri toneal  dialysis, 
and hemodiafiltrat ion). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_830374] a prevalence as high as 62.9 per 100 patient -months at the end of the long 
interdialy tic interval (Yusuf 2016 AJN). In this latter study  hyperkalemia was defined as a 
pre-dialysis serum potassium greater than 5.5 mmo l/L and its presence was associated with 
increased all -cause m ortali ty. Although potassi um-binding resins are used in so me instances 
to treat hy perkalemia in dialysis pat ients, these agents have not been systemat ically studi ed, 
are not universally used, and have no specific indications in this populat ion.
The study  is desi gned to provi de efficacy  data f or the ZS clinical development program and 
provi de infor mation relevant to the efficacy of ZS in the treatment of hyperkalemia in 
hemodialysis patients. The study  is a rando mized, double -blind study  with two treatment 
groups, ZS or placebo, and includes hemodialysis patients that have been on dialysis for a 
minimum o f [ADDRESS_1152482] ified therapy for 
severe acute hy perkalemia will be withheld in study  patients. Rescue therapy  will be available 
according to local practice patterns. Thus, placebo is deemed to be th e appropriate comparator 
in this study .

14(68)1.2.2 Rationale for doses 
Initial (hyperkalemia correction) and maintenance doses of ZS were studied extensively  in the 
Phase [ADDRESS_1152483] ment rules are al so 
adopted in this study  with appropri ate m odificat ions. 
The starting dose of ZS will be 5g once daily on non -dialysis day and may be adjusted to a 
maximum o f 15g per non -dialysis day to maintain a pre -dialysis serum K between 4 -5 
mmo l/L. ZS or placebo wi ll be administered orally on non -dialysis days for a treatment period 
of eight weeks. 
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
The primary  benefi t for pati ents randomized to ZS is expected to be the maintenance of 
norm okalemia during the long interdialy tic interval, potentially  including the relief of 
associ ated si gns and symptom s and an improved qualit y of life. ZS i s expected to be at least as 
safe as it has been shown to be in the non -dialysis popul ation.
Patients treated with placebo may  not ob tain any b enefit in terms of hyperkalemia correction, 
but m ay benefi t from the cl oser f ollow-up and will receive alternat ive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_575007]. 
An established dose adjust ment algorithm will be used during the study  to titrate ZS doses to 
enabl e pat ients to achieve and maintain pre -dialysis normokalemia after the Long Inter -
Dialytic Interval (LIDI), while evaluating any changes in prescribed dialysate potassium 
concentrations, and the rate of reduction of serum potassium during dialysis based on the 
difference between pre -and post -dialysis potassium levels. 
ZS doses may  be reduced in the event that pre -dialysis serum potassium levels after the LIDI 
fall below 4 mmo l/L and no further adjust ment on prescribed dialysate potassium 
concentration is feasible. 
Five clinical studies including a long -term safety  study  (ZS-002, ZS -003, ZS -004, ZS -004E 
and ZS -005) have been co mpleted with ZS in subjects with hyperkalemia. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_830375] S -K levels, the reductions have not been assoc iated with adverse events of 
severe hypokalemia or other clinically significant changes in electrolytes, including serum 
calcium and m agnesium . Dose rel ated increases in bicarbonate and reductions in BUN have 
been observed in ZS treated subjects. There wer e no clinically important changes in other 
clinical laboratory  tests. ZS treatm ent was well tolerated at all dose levels administered. 
The m ost comm only reported ADRs were edema -related events, which were reported in 5.7% 
of ZS-treated subjects; 1.7%, 2.7 %, 5.2%, and 14.3% of subjects rando mized to placebo, ZS 
5g, 10g or 15g QD for up to 1 month, respectively. Fift y-three percent of edema -related events

requi re trea tment.
In clinical studies, 2.3% of subjects developed hypokalemia wit h S-K value o f <3.5 mmo l/L, 
which was reso lved wit h dose adjust ment or discont inuat ion of ZS. One subject reported an S -
K value <2.8 mmo l/L. No cases of hypokalemia were reported as seri ous.
No potenti al risks based on m echanism o f action, nonclinical or clinical data have been 
ident ified for ZS.

and 5 mmo l/L after the LIDI. Maximum ZS dose is 15g once daily on non -dialysis 
days. Treatment will be continued unchanged for an addit ional 4 week evaluat ion

is recorded to be within the level of heart (the middle of the cuff on the upper arm  is at the 
level of the right atrium (the midpo int of the sternum). The patient will be instructed to relax 
as much as possible and to not talk during the measurement procedure. Preferably  
measurement will be done wit h an electronic automat ed oscillo metric device. The same device 
shoul d preferably be used for the patient during the course of the study  and in the same arm. 
Blood pressure will be measured in triplicate with at least one minute intervals between 
measurements. In HD patients BP and HR will be assessed prior to init iation o f the dialysis 
procedures. All the three readings will be reported in the eCRF. 
The heart rate will be assessed by [CONTACT_830395] 30 s immediately  after 
each recording of the blood pressure. It could be also performed wit h an oscillo metri c device 
if this is used for blood pressure measurement. The triplicate heart rate assessments will be 
recorded in the eCRF.
Blood pressure m easurem ents are to be obtained prior to init iation of eac h dialysis procedure
5.3 Other assessments
5.3.1 Dialysis prescription
Dialysis prescript ion parameters including blood flow (Qb, ml/min) and time on dialysis 
(minutes) should be recorded at the times specified in Tables 1 and 2.
5.3.2 Dialysis adequacy
Dialysis adequacy indices including spKt/V and/or urea reduction ratio (URR) should be 
recorded at the times specified in Tables [ADDRESS_1152505] recent 
values but these should be no older than 5 weeks. If no values wit hin 5 weeks are available a 
new assessment of spKt/V and/or URR should be performed on the next weekly  visit. Sites 
shoul d consistent ly use either spKt/V or URR in determining dialysis adequacy. A 
combinat ion of both is not acceptable.
5.3.3 Interdialytic weight gain
Interdialyt ic weigh t gain (IDWG) will be calculated as the difference between current pre -
dialysis wei ght minus previous post -dialysis weight (measured at immediate dialysis sessio n 
prior to the visit) in kilograms. In order to obtain all required measurements of IDWG the 
investi gators m ust m ake sure that a post -dialysis weight is available for the immediate dialysis 
session (as per usual schedule) prior to the visit.

causal relat ionship with this treatm ent.   An AE can therefo re be any unfavourable and 
unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest 
pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may  occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
6.2 Definit ions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study  phase that fulfils one or more of 
the following cri teria:
 Results in death
 Is immediately life -threatening
 Requi res in -patient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_830379] 
 Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty 
 Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patientor may 
requi re medical intervention to prevent one of the outcome s listed above.
For further guidance on the definit ion of a SAE, see Appendix A to the Clinical Study 
Protocol .
6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
Adverse Events will be co llected fro m time of randomizat ion throughout the treatm ent peri od 
and including the fo llow-up peri od (until  Visi t [ADDRESS_1152509] pati ent visi t in the study )
SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent.

Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s las t visi t in the study  are f ollowed up 
by [CONTACT_325391], but without further 
recording in the CRF. [COMPANY_008] retains the right to request additional 
inform ation for any  patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of t he study , if 
judged necessary .
6.3.3 Variables 
The fo llowing variables will be collected for each AE:
 AE (verbat im)
 The date when the AE started and stopped
 Maximum intensit y
 Whether the AE is serious or not
 Invest igator causalit y rating against the Investigat ional Product (y es/no) 
no)
 Action taken with regard to invest igational product
 AE caused patient’s withdrawal fro m study  (yes or no)
 Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
 Date AE m et cri teria for seri ous AE
 Date Invest igator became aware of serious AE
 AE is seri ous due to
 Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]

40(68) Causalit y assessment to other medicat ion
 Descript ionof AE.
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by [CONTACT_362028] 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only  a limi ted degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE w hen it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.

Adverse Event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consi der that there is a 
reasonable possibilit y that the event m ay have been caused by  [CONTACT_286661]?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures 
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any  study  procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix A to the Clinical 
Study  Protocol .
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_830396] (if applicable) or reported in 
response to the open question fro m the study  site staff: (‘Have you had any health problems 
since the previous visit/you were last as ked?’) or revealed by [CONTACT_830397]. When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when 
possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and 
there are other signs or symptom s that are not generally  part of the di agnosis, the diagnosis 
and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
6.3.[ADDRESS_1152511].
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion.  Wherever possible the reporting Invest igator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (e.g., anaemia versus low haemoglobin 
value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).

6.7 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the patient or 
has the potential to cause harm to the patient . 
A medicat ion error i s not l ack of efficacy  of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or patient .
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error: 
 occurred
 was i dentified and intercepted before th e patient received the drug
 did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to 
an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
 Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
 Dispensing error e.g. medicat ion prepared incorrect ly, even if it was not 
actually given to the patient
 Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong 
site of administrati on
 Drug not taken as indicated e.g. tablet disso lved in water when it should 
be taken as a so lid tablet 
 Drug not stored as instructed e.g. kept in the fridge when it should be at 
room  temperature 
 Wrong patient received the medication (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
 Wrong drug administered to patient (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
 Errors related to or resulting fro m IVRS/IWRS -including those which 
lead to one of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a 
medicat ion error

44(68) Patient acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) e.g. forgot to take medicat ion
 Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
 Patient failed to return unused medicat ion or em pty packaging
 Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care 
medicat ion in open label stud ies, even if an AZ product 
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may  occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.  
If an medicat ion error occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site 
personnel informs the appropri ate [COMPANY_008] representatives within [ADDRESS_1152516] igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is completed wi thin 1 or 5 calendar days if there is an SAE associated 
with the m edicat ion error (see Section 6.4) and wi thin [ADDRESS_1152517] of the studies, including [COMPANY_008]. The committee will operate in accordance

7.2 Dose and treatment regimens
ZS or placebo will be suspended in 45 ml o f water and administered orally on non -dialysis 
days for a treatment per iod of eight weeks. The initi al ZS dose will be 5g once daily  and may  
be adjusted to a maximum o f 15g per non -dialysis day  to m aintain a pre -dialysis serum  K 
between 4 -5 mmo l/L. 
All dose adjust ments will be based on pre -dialysis serum K values measured by i-STAT. 
Management of dialysis prescript ion will be according to local clinical pattern practices.
During the first 4 weeks of the treatment period, the ZS dose should be adjusted if the pre -
dialysis potassi um value after the l ong inter -dialyt ic interval is > 5.0 mmo l/L (one weekly  
dose adjustment). For patients taking [ADDRESS_1152519] -dialysis serum potassium 
concentrations should be evaluated. 
For pre -dialysis serum potassium concentrations < 4 mmo l/L, subsequent adjust ments will be 
made in accordance to locally accepted clinical pract ice patterns and guided by [CONTACT_1275]’s clinical judgment.
For si tes that adopt the clinical practice of modifying the prescribed dialysate potassium 
concentration when the pre -dialysis serum potassium concentration decreases, if pre -dialysis 
serum  Kis below 4 mmo l/L the dialysate K concentration should be increased by  0.5 or 1

46(68)mmo l/L according to standard of care, e.g. increase dialysate K fro m 1K to 1.5 or 2K, fro m 
2K to 2.5 or 3K, or fro m 3K to 3.5 or 4K. If dialysate K concentration cannot be inc reased 
further (e.g. patient already using 4K dialysate bath), the dose of ZS can be decreased by 5g or 
held if the patient is already  taking the minimum dose (5g).
For si tes where l ocal clinical  pract ice does not include increasing the dialysate K 
concent ration when pre -dialysis serum  K falls, the dose of ZS can be decreased by 5g or held 
if the pat ient is already taking the minimum dose (5g). 
If during the treatment phase (init ial 4 weeks) the dose of ZS has been reduced or held and the 
pre-dialysis potassi um value after the next long interdialy tic interval is above 5.0 mmo l/L, 
every effort should be made to increase the dose by  5g or restart ZS 5g if it was held.
After the first [ADDRESS_1152520] igator there is a 
compelling m edical  need to treat an abnormal serum potassium concentration, i.e. severe 
hyperkalemia or hy pokal emia wi th clinical  manifestati ons. If such an event we re to occur the 
appropriate ZS dose adjustment (increase or reductio n) can be made with documentation of 
the event. In the case of hyperkalemia wit h clinical manifestations deemed to require urgent 
treatm ent, rescue therapy  defined as any intervent ion cons istent wi th local pract ice patterns to 
reduce serum K can be administered fo llowed by [CONTACT_830399]. During the last [ADDRESS_1152521] ice patterns to reduce serum K in the sett ing of severe hyperkalemia

polyst yrene sulfo nate (SPS, Kay exalate, Resonium), calcium po lystyrene sulfo nate (CPS, 
Resonium calcium ) and pati romer (Vel tassa), as well as beta -adrenergic agonists, sodium 
bicarbonate, insulin/glucose and any addit ional dialysis or other forms of renal replacement 
treatm ents when used specifically for the treatment of severe hyperkalemia. In addit ion, any 
reducti on in the di alysate K concentration that is prescribed for the treatment of severe 
hyperkalemia during the study  is also consi dered rescue therapy . Rescue therapy  shoul d be 
followed by [CONTACT_830400] p roper documentation of 
the event.

8.1 Statistical considerations
 All personnel invo lved wit h the analysis o f the study  will remain blinded 
until database lock and Clinical Study  Protocol  violators i dentified.
 Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_362038] s.   
 A co mprehensive Statist ical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and 
signed off before enrollment of the first patient
8.2 Sample size estimate
For the primary  efficacy endpoint, 90 patients per treatment group (180 patients in total) will 
yield power at least 90%, assuming a placebo proportion of at most 0.3, a difference in 
proporti ons (ZS –placebo) of 0.25, using a 2 -sided Fisher’s ex act test at si gnificance level 
5%.
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets
8.3.1 Efficacy analysis set
The full analysis set (FAS) will be the primary analysis set for the efficacy  analysis and will 
include all rando mized pat ients. Patients will be analysed according to th eir randomised 
investigat ional product.
8.3.2 Safety analysis set
The safet y analysis set (SAS) will co mprise all randomized pat ients who took at least one dose 
of study  drug. Patients will be analysed according to the treatment actually  received.
8.3.[ADDRESS_1152526] 4 weeks of the 
treatm ent peri od and that do not receive rescue therapy  during the evaluat ion period. 
The safet y outcom e measures are frequencies of AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), phy sical 
examinat ion findings and vital signs, descript ive measures for laboratory  values.

51(68)The first exploratory  efficacy outcom e measure is the proportion of patien ts who are able to 
increase dialysate K concentration at the end of the study  com pared to baseline. 
The secondary  outcome m easure i s the frequency and proportion of patients requiring any 
urgent intervent ion consistent with local pract ice patterns to redu ce serum K. 
Further details will be provided in the SAP.

Durati on of  exposure to ZS and compliance rate will be summarized.  Duration of exposure 
will be summarized overall, by  [CONTACT_208885], and by  [INVESTIGATOR_24258].
8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variable (s)
The primary  efficacy  endpoint of proportion of patients with maintained K 4.[ADDRESS_1152528] 
3 out of 4 pre -dialysis days fo llowing the LIDI and that do not receive rescue therapy during 
the evaluat ion peri od will be analysed using Fisher’s exact test at the significance level 5% (2 -
sided). Thi s analysis will be based on the FAS.
All rando mized pat ients will be classified as either a responder or a non -responder regardless 
of prem ature discont inuat ion of IP, premature discontinuat ion of study  or reci eving tre atments 
other than rescue. Patients with more than one missing K measurement during the evaluat ion 
period will be classified as a non -responder.
8.5.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s)
The secondary  endpoints will be presented using a frequency  table based o n the FAS.
8.5.3 Analysis of the safety variables
For safet y analyses, adverse events will be listed. Frequency of pat ients with any adverse 
events will be summarized by [CONTACT_830402]: all 
adverse events, adverse events by i ntensity, and adverse events by [CONTACT_20084] y as assessed by  [CONTACT_24338]. All adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_830403]. Treatm ent discont inuat ions due to any adverse event will be summarized. The 
number of days from the init ial study  administrati on date to adverse event onset date will be 
computed. Seri ous adverse events or deaths will be listed and summarized.

impact of missing data, again using the Fisher’s exact test. Details will be presented in the 
SAP.
8.5.7 Exploratory analysis (if a pplicable)
The exploratory  endpo int of proporti on of  patients who are able to increase dialysate K 
concentration will be analysed using Fisher’s exact test at the significance level 5% (2 -sided). 
This analysis will be based on the FAS. There will be no adjustments for mult iplicit y and 
hence the p -value from the analysis is descript ive.
8.5.[ADDRESS_1152529] 3 pre -dialysis K measurements within 4.0 -5.0 mmo l/L and who do not 
receive rescue therapy  during the evaluat ion peri od will be defined as responders and all other

Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SA E)
Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AEas it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the patient’s 
death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe form it 
might have caused death (e.g., hepatit is that resolved witho ut hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830381] a serious AE , although the reasons 
for it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the st udy, provi ded that i t did not deteri orate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edica l events may  not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], disabilit y or incapaci ty but may jeopardize the patient or may  requi re 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious.  
These sh ould usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgement must be used.
 Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
 Hepato toxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm

drug?  Di d the AE occur i n a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of 
the suspect drug?
 Consi stency wit h known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same

 Re-challenge experi ence.  Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally  recommend or support a 
re-challenge .
 Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
 Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?
 Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, ther e is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general , that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causa l relationship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, i t is likely  that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not rela ted’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.

64(68)Appendix B International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) 6.[ADDRESS_1152539] samples
International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 3 
categori es.  For transport purp oses the classificat ion of infectious substances according to risk 
groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulat ions (DGR) in the 46th edit ion 
(2005).  Infect ious substances are now classified either as Category  A, Category  B or Exempt.  
There i s no direct relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal  disease in 
otherwi se heal thy humans or animals.  Category  A pathogens are e.g., Ebola, Lassa fever 
virus:
 are to be packed and shipped in accordance wit h IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclus ion in Category  A.  Category  B pathogens are e.g., Hepatit is A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Hum an immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ty pes 1 and 2.  They  are assigned the following UN 
number and proper shippi[INVESTIGATOR_72919]:
 UN 3373 –Biological Substance, Category  B
 are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt -all other materials wit h minimal risk of containing pathogens
 Clinical trial samples will fall into Category  B or exempt under IATA regulations
 Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and t ransported at ambient temperature 
in IATA 650 compliant packaging 
 Biological samples transported in dry  ice requi re addi tional dangerous goods 
specification for the dry -ice content
 IATA co mpliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packing and 
transportation and packing should be done by [CONTACT_73013], as applicable
 Samples routinely transported by  [CONTACT_73014] a safe and appropriate way  to
contain any  risk of infect ion or contaminat ion by [CONTACT_73015] / containment materials at all times.  The IATA [ADDRESS_1152540] or rail transport is 
used.

65(68)Appendix C Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver 
Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
1. Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report cases of Hy’s Law.  It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management 
of elevated liver biochemistries.  
During the course of the study  the Inv estigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .  The Invest igator is responsible for determining whether a patientmeets 
potenti al Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any  point during the study .
The Investigator participates, together with Astra Zeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the el evations in liver 
biochemistry  other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_309582] (IP). 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the o utcome 
of the review and assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
2. Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of 
Norm al (ULN) together wi th Total  Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any point during the study  
following the start of study  medication irrespect iveof an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase 
(ALP).
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be f ound to expl ain the combinat ion of increases, e.g., elevated ALP indicating 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.  
For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e. on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but ther e is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur .
3. Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  patientwho meets any  of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
 ALT ≥ 3xULN
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix E
Drug Substance Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (ZS)
Study Code D9480C00006
Version 4.0
Date 05 Februa ry 2018
66(68) AST ≥ 3xULN
 TBL ≥ 2xULN
When a pat ient meets any of the identificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in combination, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to [COMPANY_008] 
representative). 
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
 Notify  the Astr aZeneca representative
 Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_19690]
 Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  CRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  
local laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from centra l or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
 Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 2 Definit ions wi thin 
this Appendix for definit ion) by [CONTACT_244995] m all previous visit s 
(including both cen tral and l ocal laboratory  resul ts)
4. Follow -up
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
 Inform  the [COMPANY_008] representative that the patient has not met PHL criteria.
 Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance 
provi ded in the Clinical Study  Protocol .
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investi gator will:
 Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any  study  visit prior to starting study  
treatm ent)
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study  Team  
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  patients’ follow-up and the c ontinuous review of data.  Subsequent to 
this contact [CONTACT_73016]:

67(68) Moni tor the pati ent until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated 
 Invest igate the eti ology of the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as discussed 
with the Study  Physician. This includes deciding which the tests available in the Hy’s 
law lab kit should be used.
 Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available 
 If at any  time (in consultat ion with the Study  Physici an) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures.
5. Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
No later than [ADDRESS_1152541] and TBL elevat ions, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be m ade and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingly  and follow the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
 Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard processes. 
The ‘Me dically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.

68(68)If, there i s an unavo idable delay, of over 3 weeks, in ob taining the information necessary  to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
 Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and 
causalit y assessment as per above
 Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the 
review amending the reported term if an alternative explanat ion for the liver 
biochemistry  elevat ions is determined.

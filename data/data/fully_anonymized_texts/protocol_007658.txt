Methodology  Double blind, randomized, placebo controlled  
Study Duration  Estimated duration for the main protocol (e.g. from start of screening to last 
subject processed and finishing the study) – 36 months  
Study Center(s)  Single -center  
Objectives  To investigate whether colchicine has utility in the treatment of knee OA pain, 
and in the modulation of both blood- based and imaging biomarkers that may 
associate with symptomatic and structural progression of knee OA.

Statistical Methodology  The following will be used where appropriate: descriptive statistics, tests of 
normality of continuous outcome measurements, T -tests or Wilcoxon 
nonparametric counterpart , chi-square (Fisher exact) test to compare 
proportions of outcomes between groups, multivariate linear (logistic) regression methods with adjustment of potential confounding variables. When multiple time points are considered such as at baseline, 1, 2 and 3 months, 
we will model linear trajectories of outcome scores across time using mixed-effects regression models. The models will be specified with random 
intercepts and slopes such that a linear trajectory representing outcome

 [ADDRESS_103994] seeks to investigate whether colchicine, an already FDA -approved treatment for gout, has utility 
in osteoarthritis (OA). OA is the most common arthritis, with more than 30 million people affected in the [LOCATION_002]. OA can be painful, debilitating and may even shorten life expectancy. Unfortunately, approved drug treatments are only analgesic, and for many patients work poorly and/or are poorly tolerated 
(indeed, recent data suggests that acetaminophen, the first line therapy for OA, is essentially ineffective). 
There are no drugs approved in the US to actually slow down the progression of OA. OA processes are 
beginning to be better understood, and it is now appreciated that local inflammation is likely to play a role 
in OA joint pain, impairment of joint function, and the health of joint cells including cartilage cells (chondrocytes) and synovial cells, whose proper function is essential to maintaining joint health. We and 
others have reported that local OA inflammation can actually be detectible systemically through biomarkers 
in the blood of some OA patients, and that in those patients OA may progress faster. In this project we propose to test an anti -inflammatory drug known as colchicine, which has been in use for more than 2,000 
years for gout and other inflammatory disorders. At low doses colchicine is well tolerated, and preliminary evidence suggests that colchicine 1) targets some of the processes now appreciated to play a role in OA , 
and 2) may have a positive impact on OA pain. We will enroll patients with knee OA, already accessible to 
us from a previous study (Leukocyte Gene Expression in Osteoarthritis, LGEO), along with information 
collected from that study, and treat them with colchicine or placebo daily. In addition to measuring impact on pain and function, we will measure colchicine’s impact on markers of inflammation, in both the blood 
and the joint fluid (including uric acid levels as a novel biomarker of serum and synovial fluid). We will use 
imaging to assess the impact of colchicine on inflammatory synovitis within the joints. If successful, our 
studies could identify a new (old!) drug as a potential treatment for OA, and perhaps as a potential agent 
than can actually alter OA biology. If colchicine is effective on some but not all outcomes, that will still be a 
potential major treatment advance.  Even if colchicine does not improve OA status, the intensive assessment that is intrinsic to the trial will extend our prior, NI H-funded study of OA natural history, and 
provide important insights into OA biomarkers and progression.  
1.1 Background 
 
Osteoarthritis (OA): Scope of the Problem : O
 A affects more than 30 million adults in the [LOCATION_003] (1, 2), yet 
disease modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) are currently lacking. Few randomized controlled trials have 
assessed the effect of medications on both symptom and structure modification, based upon proposed OA 
pathologic mechanisms, and none have shown unequivocal success.  
 
OA as an Inflammatory Dis e ase: We and others have shown that OA is locally, and perhaps systemically 
inflammatory (3 -7). Synovitis is present (7,8), and cytokines including IL-1β and TNF -α can be detected in 
the synovial fluid and peripheral blood of patients with OA joint degeneration (4,9). Furthermore, our 
analyses of peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) gene expression profiles have identified a subset of 
symptomatic knee OA (SKOA) patients, whose increased expression of mRNA for IL-1β, TNF -α, and COX -
2 is associated with increased pain and risk for radiographic progression at 24 months ( Tables 1     
and 2 ) (4). We have also shown in multiple cohorts that the pro-inflammatory lipi[INVESTIGATOR_94045]2 and 15-HETE

 are detectable in the plasma of ~40% of SKOA patients, and are similarly associated with OA disease 
severity (10). Most recently, we found that plasma levels of IL -1Ra (IL -[ADDRESS_103995]) are 
independently associated with SKOA severity and progression (11). Taken together, these findings suggest 
that there is chronic low -grade inflammation in SKOA, and that at least some soluble and cellular markers 
of OA joint inflammation can be detected in peripheral blood. It is not surprising, then, that certain anti-
inflammatory strategies (e.g., steroid injections, NSAIDs) have some capacity for ameliorating OA symptoms, although these agents do not appear to affect OA structural outcomes (12). Given the 
prevalence, pain and disability of OA, and the current lack of adequate treatments, the possibility that other 
anti-inflammatory strategies might prove equally or ideally more effective for ameliorating OA symptoms, 
and certainly, the possibility that the “right” anti -inflammatory strategies might have disease m odifying 
activities, deserves serious consideration.   
 
 
  
A Role for Crystals in OA? C
 linicians have long assumed an association between crystal arthropathies and 
OA presence, but investigations assessing a clinical, or indeed a pathogenic relationship between crystals 
and OA are few and far between. Crystal -induced mechanical cartilage damage could theoretically 
stimulate OA progression; in this regard it is relevant that OA and gout or chondrocalcinosis frequently co-occur (13). Muehlemann et al  investi gated the prevalence of monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium 
pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals in 7855 cadaveric tali. The presence of crystals was strongly associated with 
cartilage lesions that seemed to be biomechanically induced. Strikingly, however, only 34%  of crystals 
detected were CPP; the remaining 66% composed of MSU, suggesting a role for MSU crystals even in the absence of clinical gout (14). Indeed, in ultrasound studies from our group and others, MSU crystals on cartilage can be detected in a significant percentage of patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, and 
even occasionally in patients with neither hyperuricemia nor gout (15). In addition to biomechanically -
induced cartilage damage leading to OA, MSU and other crystals might act biochemically, biophysically or 
via receptor (e.g., Toll -like Receptor 4) interactions to induce chondrocyte and/or synoviocyte activation, 
leading to OA. In gout and pseudogout, the concept of MSU crystals mediating joint inflammation is well 
established. In particular,  MSU (and CPP) crystals promote the release of IL- 1β and IL- 18 via activation of 
the NLRP3 inflammasome (16). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_94046]- 1β in OA, it remains uncertain whether the IL- 1β 
/inflammasome pathway contributes to the development of OA in joints affected by [CONTACT_94081]- triggered 
inflammation. Supporting such a model, synovial fluid urate concentrations have recently been shown to correlate with synovial fluid IL- 1β and IL- 18, and with radiographic severity of knee OA (9), leading the 
investigators to propose that chondrocyte necrosis in early OA results in the release of urate as a “danger signal,” promoting IL- 1β generation, additional inflammation, and further chondrocyte death. Other 
mechanisms could also play a role in the contribution of MSU deposition to OA. For example, Liu et al have 
demonstrated that MSU crystals can directly (i.e., independent of IL-1β) up -regulate inducible nitric oxide 
synthetase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO) release and MMP -3 secretion, all mediators with potential roles in OA 
pathogene sis (17,18).

 Our group has conducted a prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_94047], 
asymptomatic hyperuricemic and control subjects (19). 
Using standardized radiographs to assess for knee OA, and musculoskeletal ultrasound to assess for occult MSU 
deposition, we found a markedly increased prevalence and severity of knee OA in gout patients vs. non-hyperuricemic controls, and an intermediate prevalence and severity of 
knee OA in asymptomatic hyperuricemia patients (Figure 
2). Moreover, patients with MSU cartilage deposition on 
ultrasound were more likely to have knee OA than those 
without, regardless of gout versus hyperuricemic status. 
Interestingly, MSU deposition conveyed risk for knee OA 
even when the deposition was in OA -unaffected joints, 
suggesting the possibility of a metabolic or systemic 
inflammatory effect.  
 More recently , we have taken the opposite approach, 
reviewing a group of patients with known medial knee OA 
for whom we had available standing knee X -rays at 
baseline and after two years. Using banked serum, we 
assessed patient baseline urate values and compared 
them with the degree of progression. Consistent with an interaction between urate and OA, we observed a direct correlation between baseline urate values and the degree of 
joint space narrowing (JSN) over the observation period 
(Figure 3 ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_103996] commonly used to treat gout and calcium crystal -induced inflammation, is a generally safe 
and well -tolerated drug, with more than two thousand years of physician experience (20). Colchicine is a 
tricyclic, lipid -soluble alkaloid with a long terminal half -life (20 to 40 hours) and bioavailability ranging from 
24% to 88% ( Figure 4 ).  Within the bloodstream, ~40% of colchicine binds to albumin. Although peak 
plasma concentrations occur 1 hour after administration, maximal anti -inflammatory effects develop over 
24 to 48 hours, based on leukocyte accumulation. Colchicine reaches much higher concentrations in leukocytes than in plasma, and persists there for several days after ingestion, with concentrations ranging 
from 4 to 64 ng/10
9.  Colchicine uptake into other cells has not been as rigorously defined, but evidence 
suggests that the drug also affects monocyte/macrophages and synovial fibroblasts. Whether colchicine 
directly affects chondrocytes has not been determined.

1.3 Preclinical Data  
 
Colchicine inhibits microtubules and adhesion molecules in inflammatory cells, abrogating multiple 
processes that contribute to the production of catabolic mediators in the joint (21, 22). Colchicine inhibits 
neutrophil chemotaxis and lysosomal enzyme release (23). Colchicine modulates E - and L -selectin 
distribution and expression, impeding leukocyte- endothelial cell interactions (22). More recently it has been 
shown that colchicine also inhibits caspase -1 in the monocyte/macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome, thus 
blocking the conversion of pro- IL-1β to active IL- 1β, mitigating the release of IL -1β and, secondarily, of 
TNFα a nd other inflammatory mediators that are also implicated in OA (16) ( Figure 5).  
 Colchicine is most commonly used to treat acute gouty flares, and as prophylaxis for gouty flares as well 
as for prophylaxis and acute treatment of calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis (i.e., pseudogout). It also

 used in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), some types of vasculitides and neutrophilic dermatoses, 
pericarditis, and more recently has been studied in coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation.  
 
The apparent  as sociation between crystals and OA lends biologic plausibility to the possibility that 
colchicine, by [CONTACT_94082], could be an effective treatment for OA. Figure 5 displays how 
colchicine’s mechanisms of action target several processes implicated in OA.  Importantly, colchicine 
warrants study even if crystals are not a driving factor in OA pathogenesis, given its ability to inhibit the 
production of cytokines and inflammatory markers that are known to be associated with OA joint pain and 
dege neration. Critical to this study, our group has had significant research expertise in studying 
inflammation and colchicine for many years. For 
example, in patients with gout, we are currently studying 
whether chronic colchicine use is associated with 
reduc ed rates of acute cardiovascular (CV) syndromes 
(24). We are also collaborating with our interventional 
cardiology colleagues to test whether cardiac patients 
who are given colchicine prior to percutaneous CV 
intervention experience reduced rates of post -procedure 
inflammation (a marker of poorer long- term outcomes), 
compared with patients who receive placebo.

1.[ADDRESS_103998] of colchicine in knee OA (25,26,27). Aran et al examined physician and patient global assessment endpoints, using non- validated 15 -point VAS scales, in 61 female  patients, and found that 
patients receiving colchicine had improved assessment scores and approximately a 50% decrease in the 
use of breakthrough pain medication (acetaminophen) compared to placebo controls (25). Das et al studied 
the addition of colchicine to nimesulide (an NSAID) in 36 patients, and found significantly improved total 
WOMAC and VAS pain scores in the colchicine vs placebo groups (26). Das also examined the addition of colchicine to intra- articular steroids and pi[INVESTIGATOR_94048] 39 patients wit h clinical evidence of “inflammation” of 
the knee, of whom 38% had radiographic chondrocalcinosis and 74% had C[COMPANY_003] crystals on polarizing microscopy (27). They found a greater reduction in 15- point VAS pain and greater improvement in a 
modified WOMAC scale , in the group who received colchicine vs placebo.  
 Limitations in the designs of the aforementioned studies, as well as the brief time frames of their study periods, underline the need for investigations incorporating rigorous methodology and validated outcome 
measures. Moreover, these prior studies did not address the cellular, inflammatory or structural impact of 
colchicine treatment. The possibility that a well -established, relatively safe, and FDA -approved drug might 
improve the management of a currently untreatable disease lends further urgency to the question. We 
therefore propose a double- blind, randomized controlled trial, to determine whether colchicine treatment 
can: 
- improve pain, function, and quality of life in SKOA patients  
- improve inflammato ry PBL, plasma, and synovial fluid markers in SKOA patients  
- reduce OA synovitis and/or effusion, determined by [CONTACT_94083] (MSK -US); we will 
also use MSK -US to correlate the presence of crystals observed on cartilage both with biomarker 
inflammation and OA response to colchicine

To accomplish this, we will employ a well -established SKOA cohort, whom we have been following in 
natural history studies since 2005, and for whom we already possess baseline clinical, radiographic, 
ultrasound, genetic, PBL genomic and plasma/serum biomarker data.  
1.5 Dose Rationale 
 Subjects will be randomized to take colchicine 0.6mg,  0.8mg, or placebo daily. In gout practice, an option 
to use colchicine 0.6mg (U.S.) or 0.5mg (internationally) once or twice daily is recommended for prophylaxis of gout flares. For acute flares, a dosing regimen of 1.2 mg followed by 0.6mg 1 hour later showed no greater gastrointestinal adverse events than placebo (Terkeltaub A&R 2010). For our study, a new, once -
daily dose of colchicine 0.8mg is being formulated. This dose was chosen because we expect it to be 1) almost universally tolerated, 2) likely to have a higher compliance rate than twice -daily dosing, 3) less likely 
than twice daily dosing to require dose adjustment for co- morbidities or concomitant medications and 4) 
potentially more efficacious than a once -daily 0.6mg dose. However, because recent studies suggest that 
a dose of 0.6mg may be sufficient for chronic inflammatory suppression and may reduce the already low 
risk of toxicity of 0.8mg, for the remainder (second half) of the study we will switch from the 0.8mg to a 
0.6mg dose to allow comparison of the two doses (36).  
1.6 Research Risks & Benefits  
1.6.1   Risks of Study Drug  
As a bioactive substance, colchicine is generally well tolerated within the dose range being studied. However, some patients may experience upset stomach, nausea/vomiting and/or loose stools. Colchicine 
can induce bone marrow suppression and a neuromyopathy, mostly after overdose; such occurrences 
would be extremely rare at the doses and duration being studied, particularly since we will exclude individuals whose metabolism of  colchicine may be altered by [CONTACT_94084]. See 
Appendices I (PI – Package Insert) and II (MSDS -Material Data Safety Sheets).

Knee Radiographs  
As an entry criterion, bilateral standardized knee radiographs showing the presence of a Kellgren- Lawrence 
grade [ADDRESS_104000] extent possible we will 
employ local anesthesia (anesthetic topi[INVESTIGATOR_94049] a soft-tissue lidocaine injection), and perform 
the procedure under ultrasound guidance, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_94050]. Patients with larger effusions may derive pain relief from the volume decompression of the procedure. The most concerning risk of arthrocentesis is the potential for introducing an infection from the skin into the joint. In general 
practice this risk appears to be extremely low based on available data, between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 procedures. We will minimize this risk b y 1) using meticulous aseptic technique; 2) only attempting to 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_94051]; 3) using ultrasound 
guidance for the procedure to reduce the need for blind exploration with the needle to reach the effusion 
pocket. Knee Arthrocentesis will be performed at the screening visit and three month visit for the subset 
that qualifies and consents to this additional study procedure. This procedure may be performed in one or 
both knees depending on ultrasound findings.  
 
Bilateral Physical Knee Exam  
This assessment does not pose any adverse risks or dangers. It is a standard exam performed by [CONTACT_94088], pain, tenderness, and function. It will 
be performed by a study physician. Participants will be asked to stand during this assessment and to bend their knees. This study procedure will be performed at the screening visit and the three month visit.  
 
Risk to Privacy and Confidentiality  
As wi th all research studies, the risk of participating in this study involves a loss of privacy and 
confidentiality. However, the study team and study doctors will assign each subject with a four -digit 
screening number in sequential order of the screening visit date. All participants who are eligible for this 
study after the screening visit will be assigned a five digit subject ID number at baseline in sequential order of the baseline visit date. These numbers will be put on the subject’s questionnaires and samples so their 
names and identifying information will not be disclosed. Only the PI, [CONTACT_94116][INVESTIGATOR_76162], and his study 
team will have the information that links the name [CONTACT_20565]. They will keep that information in a secured location accessible only to select research staff.   All digital data collected in the study will be 
maintained in a secure REDCap file, which is password– protected.

 1.6.3  Potential benefits  
 
Subjects participating in this research may potentially benefit from improved pain, function and quality of life as a result of the study medication. However, it is unknown whether or not the study drug will help 
subjects with osteoarthritis. Indirectly, information from subjects in this study may eventually help other 
avoid the consequences of OA and its co- morbidities in the future.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
 
Purpose: OA is a common, painful, and debilitating form of arthritis for which no disease modifying therapy 
currently exists. Studies from our group and others indicate that OA is accompanied by [CONTACT_94089], suggesting that inflammation may contribute to disease symptoms/progression. Colchicine is an anti -
inflammatory agent used commonly for gout. Colchicine mechanisms of action target several processes implicated in OA, and small preliminary studies suggest that colchicine may ameliorate OA knee pain. We 
therefore propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled trial to test whether colchicine treatment 
of symptomatic knee OA (SKOA) patients will lower pain scores and improve physical function. We 
hypothesize that clinical improvement will be associated with reduction of inflammatory candidate genomic, plasma and synovial fluid biomarkers, and with improved imaging outcomes. We will recruit subjects from 
a well -establi shed SKOA cohort, Leukocyte Gene Expression in Osteoarthritis (LGEO), whom we followed 
in a prospective natural history study beginning in 2005 (NIH R01 AR052873, PI [INVESTIGATOR_94052]), and who have  
completed that observational study. To the fullest extent possible, our interventional study will employ as 
entry criteria assessments and outcome measures used in the parent observational study, including clinical, 
radiographic, ultrasound, peripheral blood genomic, and plasma/serum biomarker results for these subjects . 
 Objective 1:  To test whether daily colchicine treatment for three months improves clinical outcomes 
in SKOA. Patients will be assessed for clinical outcomes (i.e., pain, physical function) using VAS (Visual 
Analog Scale) for pain and KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) instruments. Pain medication use will be evaluated at each assessment time.  
 
The primary clinical outcome will be the difference in mean changes of VAS pain scores between 
treatment groups at 3 months. The VAS scale asks patients to rate the pain that they’ve had in each knee during the past 30 days on a scale of 0-10, where "0" means "No pain" and "10" means "Pain as 
bad as you can imagine."   
 Secondary clinical outcomes  will include: 
• mean changes and absolute differences in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
Score (KOOS) for pain between and within the groups at 3 months.   
• mean changes and absolute differences of KOOS stiffness, physical function and total 
KOOS scores between and within the groups at 3 months.  
• mean absolute doses and changes in dosage of acetaminophen or other medications 
used for pain between and within the groups at baseline and 3 months.  
 Objective 2: To test whether colchicine suppresses peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL), plasma and 
synovial flu id OA biomarkers of inflammation (Abramson Lab).   
 
PBL Genomic Studies .
  PBL will be isolated from all subjects at baseline (or end of parent study if within 3 
months) and 3 months. qPCR will be performed on PBL RNA (buffy coat PBMC).The qPCR panel will be 
based on our preliminary findings, likely including IL- 1β, TNF- α, IL-1Ra and COX -2. qPCR data will be pre -
processed for quality control, including correction of off -scale measurement and normalization. To obtain 
comparable results across assays, we will use the comparative C T method ( 2-ΔΔCt method) as our 
normalization strategy. Logarithmic transformation will be performed on gene expression data if not 
normally distributed. We will use the qPCR library ( http://www.dr -s pi[INVESTIGATOR_94053].de/qpcR.html ) with i n Bioconductor 
2.6.

Plasma protein/lipid biomarker specimens  w ill be collected from all subjects at baseline and 3 months, 
including IL- 1Ra, PGE 2, 15-HETE, highly sensitive C -reactive protein (hsCRP), MMP -1, MMP- 3, MMP- 9 
and urate. MMP -1, 3 and 9 levels will be assayed via multiplex ELISA (#K15034C -1), and hsCRP using 
#K151STD -1, (Meso Scale Diagnostics). IL- 1Ra will be evaluated using #DRA00B from R & D systems. 
PGE 2 and 15- HETE will be analyzed using the ACE competitive EIA kit (Cat no:514010; Cayman Chemical, 
MI). IL -1β and TNF -α soluble protein levels will not be assessed, as we have previously shown that these 
levels do not accurately reflect knee OA severity owing to low levels and measurement limitations.  
 
Synovial Fluid (SF) Studies  ( Optional). Subjects will undergo arthrocentesis during their screening and 
three month visits if effusion is detected on ultrasound  and they consent to participate in these substudies. 
Thus, we expect to collect SF from a potentially more “inflammatory” subset of SKOA s ubjects. SF markers, 
measured by [CONTACT_94090]. Mukundan Attur, will include IL-1β, TNF -α, IL-
1Ra, IL -18, MMP -3, MCP- [ADDRESS_104001]. Attur’s Immunology laboratory will do the synovial fluid, 
blood, and plasma studies.    
 
Objective 2a : W e will compare absolute levels and mean changes in PBL gene expression levels for 
IL-1β, TNF -α, IL-1Ra, and COX -2 between baseline and 3 months in colchicine and placebo groups; we 
will also examine whether levels of individual biomarkers significantly change between baseline and 3 
months within each group.  
 
Objective 2b : W e will compare absolute levels and mean changes in plasma levels of IL -1Ra, PGE 2, 
15-HETE, MMP- 1, MMP -3, MMP -9 and CRP  between baseline and 3 months in colchicine and placebo 
groups; we will also examine whether levels of individual biomarkers significantly change between baseline 
and 3 months within each group.  
 
Objective 2c : We will compare absolute levels and mean changes in SF IL -1β, TNF -α, IL-1Ra, IL -18, 
MCP -1, MMP -3, and urate betw een baseline and 3 months, in colchicine and placebo groups; we will also 
examine whether levels of individual biomarkers significantly change between baseline and 3 months within 
each group. We will additionally examine associations of SF biomarkers with their peripheral blood 
correlates (e.g. SF IL-1 β with PBL IL-1β gene expression) at each time point measured  
 
A
im 3: To determine the impact of three months of daily colchicine on musculoskeletal ultrasound 
(MSK -US) signs of synovitis and effusion:  
 
MSK - U S: We will assess for urate (as double -contour sign) and calcium pyrophosphate crystal (CPP; as 
chondrocalcinosis) deposition as well as degenerative change in the articular cartilage, C[COMPANY_003] in the 
menisci, effusions, osteophytes and synovitis, using standardized ultrasound methodology as well as 
specific approaches for synovitis. Jonathan Samuels, MD, or team physicians trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Samuels, will 
scan the longitudinal suprapatellar, flexed transverse suprapatellar, medial and lateral views of the knee, using a frequency of 18 MHz (MyLab25 Gold, Biosound Esaote, Indianapolis Indiana). Subjects will undergo 
arthrocentesis during their screening and three month visits if effusion is detected on ultrasound and they consent to participate in these substudies.  
 
Objective 3a .
  We will compare changes in synovitis and effusion between colchicine and placebo 
groups. Mean changes in MSK -US-measured synovitis and effusion at 3 months will be compared between 
the two groups, as well as within each group. We hypothesize that, consistent with our prior observations, 
OA patients will frequently demonstrate synovitis; and that synovitis will improve after colchicine but not 
placebo treatment.  
 
Objective 3b .  We will compare rates of crystal deposition  (urate, calcium) on MSK -US between 
colchicine and placebo groups over three months, and assess the relationship between crystal 
deposition, OA severity, levels of inflammation and response to colchicine. We will examine the

15 | Page  
 association of crystal deposition and OA severity by [CONTACT_94091]. We will also 
examine whether crystal deposition associates with PBL, plasma, and especially SF inflammatory 
mediators. We hypothesize that some OA patients will have previously unappreciated crystal deposition, that may correlate with indices of pain and inflammation. We will determine whether colchicine treatment 
alters any associations found  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This Phase 2, prospective, double- blind, placebo -controlled, randomized trial will enroll 120 SKOA subjec ts 
through the Peter D. Seligman Center for Advanced Therapeutics which is located the at the NYU Langone 
Orthopedic Center ([ADDRESS_104002], Fourth Floor), [LOCATION_001], [LOCATION_001] [ZIP_CODE].   Patients meeting entry 
criteria will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_104003] detailed evaluation of standardized clinical pain outcomes, candidate peripheral blood biomarkers,

3.2 Primary Study Endpoints 
 
Outcomes Measured: Clinical assessments for symptoms and medication use will be made for each study 
visit (according to Table of Study Visits/Procedures. Biomarker blood samples will be obtained at baseline 
and 3 months. MSK -US and synovial fluid will be measured on a subset of the cohort (described below) at 
screening and 3 months.

4.[ADDRESS_104011] Recruitment and Screening  
 
Subjects will be primarily recruited from the LGEO (Leukocyte Gene Expression and Genetic Biomarkers 
of OA Incidence and Progression: s12- [ZIP_CODE]) natural history  study described in detail below. Subjects will 
initially be recruited from the pool of patients whose most recent knee radiograph (LGEO exit x -ray) 
indicates KL grade 2 or 3. The LGEO study was a previous observational OA study. Previous sample collected included blood, synovial fluid, ultrasound, x -ray, and/or MRI. These subjects consented to be 
contact[CONTACT_94092]. The investigators also reserve the option to offer participation to 
subjects who have already participated in other prior knee OA studies at the NYU Langone Orthopedic 
Center. If necessary, the investigators may also seek appropriate subjects in their own clinics and practices, and will communicate through word of mouth to colleagues in the NYU/NYC rheumatology community. 
Alerts in the form of letters or e -mails to colleague practitioners may be employed, as necessary. The 
investigators may also post the flyer and colleague letter to their  personal social media pages (Facebook 
and Twitter) to alert outside physicians and potential candidates about the study. The social media interaction will be limited to 1- way communication and people who are interested will be asked to call the 
number listed in the post and not respond via social media.  Personal social networking sites cannot  be 
used for communication with the study team as privacy cannot be ensured, because we are instructing 
those on social media not to respond on the social media platform but to call the coordinator, privacy will be maintained in the same manner as all other recruitment methods.  In addition, it may become necessary 
to use DataCore as part of our recruitment plan. DataCore can provide a list of potential subjects, based on selected criteria, from various EMR sources, such as EPIC. Our research team will revi ew that list to 
identify potential candidates. Once identified, potential subjects may be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], after a chart review. For 
patients who have not previously signed a release to be contact[CONTACT_94093], we will first reach 
out to their primary  provider and ask them to obtain patient permission to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. In addition to 
DataCore, i2b2, Slicer Dicer, and MyChart will also be utilized to recruit subjects for the study. Moreover, 
the iConnect Volunteer Registry  may be utilized to recruit potential subjects . The registry is available for 
whomever is  interested in participating in clinical studies at NYU Langone Health. Volunteers who agree to 
be apart of the registry will be asked to provide standard information, including demographics (age, race, 
gender, etc) and medical history. Our research team may use the registry to identify a list of potential 
volunteers by [CONTACT_94094] . Once identified,  potential volunteers 
may be contact[CONTACT_94095], inquire interest, and complete a phone screen. Alternatively , the 
research team may  receive referrals for potential volunteers  interested in the study  and request  to be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. If potential volunteers  fit the baseline criteria to be screened, the research team will obtain 
consent prior to initiating any study procedures.  
 Finally, we may consider recruitment through our arthritis clinics and primary care clinics  at our affiliated 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94059], the VA [LOCATION_001] Harbor Healthcare System, and The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53066].  Should those sites be used, we will first secure local IRB approval.  
 
Flyers will be distributed electronically or in print versions to rheumatologists, orthopedists and other 
musculoskeletal practitioners at the NYU Langone Orthopedic Center, and to primary care physicians within the NYU faculty practice network.  Flyers will be displayed by [CONTACT_94096].  
 
Screening and Consent : SKO
 A (s14 -[ZIP_CODE]) cohort subjects who meet entry criteria will be invited to 
participate in our prospective, double -blind, placebo- controlled, randomized trial. Subjects will be 
approached for written informed consent in accordance with the policies of the NYU School of Medicine 
Institutional Review Board and GCP and ICH Guidelines.   
 S
ubjects may also be screened over the phone using the Telephone Screening Interview form.  
 
Signal Knee Selection  
Study number: s16-[ZIP_CODE] 
Version: JULY 25 2023 
 
19 | Page  
 Signal knee is the knee that will be assessed for the duration of the study. For the purposes of identifying 
the signal knee, pain proceeds KL severity.  If pain and KL severity are equal in both knees, then it will be 
up to the discretion of the physician as to which knee to follow for the purpose of the study.   
 
 
a. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 120 knee OA subjects will be enrolled in all arms of the study.  
b. Gender of Subjects  
Subjects will not be restricted by [CONTACT_547], although we anticipate that a majority of subjects will be female as the disease is more common in women, and the parent study pool is 63% female.  
  
c. Age of Subjects  
Subjects will be [ADDRESS_104012] groups, as specified by [CONTACT_94097] (e.g., pregnant women, neonates, children, and terminally ill patients) will either be ineligible to participate or will be specifically excluded (or will have already been excluded from the LGEO study). OA is a disease seen predominantly in aging; thus 
pregnant women would not likely be diagnosed with OA.  Moreover, although colchicine use in clinical 
practice is often continued in pregnant women with familial Mediterranean fever, we will exclude all pregnant women from this study as a risk -benefit consideration. Neonates and children are under age 40, making 
them ineligible for the study. Terminally ill patients will be excluded, as they may not be able to complete the duration of the study based on life expectation and/or functional status. Subjects who lack capacity t o 
consent for themselves, e.g. cognitively impaired persons, will be excluded. Members of minorities, 
economically and/or educationally disadvantaged persons, and students and employees will be eligible to 
participate if they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. However, we will consent only in English for this 
study.  
 
It is possible that employees of NYU Langone Health System may express interest in participating in the 
study, creating the need to define employees as a potential vulnerable population due to their employability 
at the institution.  No employees will be coerced into participating, nor will their disinterest in participating 
be held against them in any way. In sum, their employability will not be impacted based on whether or not 
they choose to participate in this study and it will be fully explained to them that their potential involvement 
in the study will not impact their job position, future job standing, or employee evaluation.  
 
Further it is possible that students of NYU may wish to participate in this study. No students will be coerced 
into participating, nor will their disinterest in participating be held against them in any way.  It will be fully explained to them that their decision to participate, or not to participate, in this study will not influence or 
impact their status, position, standing, or grades at NYU. No study personnel are involved in the grading 
and evaluation of the students that are to be potentially recruited. Should employees or students choose to participate; the study team will treat their privacy and confidentiality with the highest regard and make every 
effort to ensure that the knowledge of their involvement is limited to the study staff and the participating 
individual.  
 
4.4 Early Withdrawal  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time without having to provide a reason. 
Alternatively, subjects may be withdrawn at the investigator’s discretion if it is in the subject’s best 
interest. Subjects who become pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study.  
 
Study number: s16-[ZIP_CODE] 
Version: JULY 25 2023 
 
20 | Page  
 Every effort will be made for withdrawn subjects to undergo end of study assessments, regardless of the 
reason for withdrawal. If a subject refuses end of study procedures, the reason for refusal will be fully 
documented in the subject’s source document and recorded in the study specific eCRF in REDCap. It is the subject’s right to withdraw from the trial without providing a reason. In this case, the source documents 
and the eCRF should document the reason for discontinuation as “withdrawal of consent”. Withdrawn 
subjects will not be replaced.  
 
Whilst the effect of withdrawals will be investigated, subjects withdrawing for any reason will be counted as 
non-remitters in the primary analysis and therefore no adjustment in sample size for withdrawals is 
necessary.  
 
Discontinuation of Study Therapy  
 
Subjects may discontinue taking study medication at any time. In the event subjects permanently discontinue study medication, they will be asked to return for remaining study visits. All  subjects, whether 
completing the study or withdrawn prematurely, will be followed up through the last visit on the schedule of assessment.  The study team will collect any new adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications at every visit.  
 If any subject is discontinued from study therapy, an explanation of this clinical decision will be documented. If the reason for discontinuing study therapy is an AE or an abnormal laboratory test result, 
the specific event or test will be recorded in the eCRF. Subjects who are discontinued from study therapy 
will undergo all study assessments up to and including the early termination visit, if possible.  
 
Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to an AE or SAE  
 
Subjects may be permanently discontinued from study drug because of an AE or SAE. It is vital to obtain 
follow -up data on any subject withdrawn because of an AE or SAE. In any case, every effort will be made 
to evaluate protocol -specified safety follow -up procedures (i.e., Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs and 
Pregnancy). If a subject is withdrawn due to an AE or SAE, the event will be followed by [CONTACT_94098]. All AEs should be followed until resolution, stabilization or the subj ect is lost to follow -up and cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
 
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
 
Participants will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. Subjects will otherwise 
be withdrawn if they experience serious adverse events to the study intervention, or non- serious adverse 
events that fail to resolve with ongoing treatment and/or temporary dose withholding.

5.7 General Method of Preparation and packaging 
– General description of how drug is manufactured/prepared  
Blendin g:  
The Colchicine, USP and Microcrystalline Cellulose, NF (Avicel pH 101) are passed through an 8 
mesh screen and then charged into two #[ADDRESS_104016] at High Speed using a #0 screen (1532- 0027).  
 
The Colchicine/Avicel mix, Milled Lactose, Sodium Starch Glycolate, NF, and Colloidal Silicon 
Dioxide, NF are passed through a 20 mesh screen, loaded in a 7 ½ cubic foot tumbler, and mixed 
for 22.5 minutes.  
 
The Magnesium Stearate, NF is passed through a 30 mesh screen and then charged to the 
tumbler in 5 equal parts, each of which is followed by a one minute mixing time.  
 
After the blended material is sampled, it is discharged into drums as Colchicine – Final Blend, and 
held until in- process testing is complete and the material is ready for encapsulation.  
 Encapsulation: A GKF 1500 Capsule Filler with a 7.5mm Dosing Disc and a CP -350 Capsule Polisher are used 
for the encapsulation process.  A KKE 1500 is used to check weigh the filled capsules and a 
MET30+ metal detector inspects the capsules prior to depositing them into a bulk capsule 
container.  
 
The Colchicine – Final Bl end is loaded into the powder hopper of the GKF 1500 Capsule Filler.  
No.4 med Orange/Lt Blue Opaque Hard Gelatin Empty Capsules are loaded into the empty 
capsule hopper of the GKF 1500.  The capsule filling machine is adjusted to achieve the desired 
target fill weight, including adjustment of the tampi[INVESTIGATOR_94061].

Microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel pH 101) was selected as a diluent and carrier of the colchicine 
drug.  Microcrystalline cellulose has a particle size of [ADDRESS_104018].  Anhydrous lactose, DT grade was selected to obtain a free flowing blend which 
can aid in the weight uniformity during the encapsulation process.  Sodium starch glycolate 
(Primojel) was used for faster dissolution.  Colloidal silicon dioxide (Cab -O-Sil) was used as a 
glidant.  Magnesium stearate, NF Hyqual grade, with a particle size limit of 50
th percentile between 
10.5- 16.5 microns, was selected as a lubricant.  
 The following components used in the manufacture of Colcichine Capsules, 0.8mg are 
compendial: Microcrystaline Cellulose, Anhydrous Lactose, Sodium Starch Glycolate, Colloidal 
Silicon Dioxide and Magnesium Stearate.  
 The only non -compendial component is the empty hard gelatin capsule, which is commonly used 
in the manufacture of pharmaceutical capsule products.  
 The gelatin capsules are provided by [CONTACT_94103]., Ltd, Seoul, Korea.  Capsules are 
manufactured from cow or pig sources and are certified BSE and TSE free.

[ADDRESS_104024] characteristics. Frequency distributions and chi -square tests will be used to screen for major imbalances in the two randomization 
groups for qualitative variables; graphical displays including and box plots and summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, ranges, etc.) will be used for quantitative variables with t -tests (after 
appropriate transformations if necessary to meet the assumptions of the methods).  For example, we will 
conduct the Kolmogorov -Smirnov  or the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]- Wilk test  for the continuous outcomes such as VAS, pain 
scores from Aim 1, PBL gene expression, and plasma levels in Aim 2, to confirm normality of measurements prior to performing statistical analyses. Detection of outliers will be done using histograms, box -plots, 
normal plots and summary statistics. Where appropriate, logarithmic transformation will be further done.  
 In order to assess for significant differences in mean changes of continuous outcomes between 
drug/placebo groups, we will perform un- paired T -tests or Wilcoxon nonparametric counterpart where 
deviated from normality. When outcomes are dichotomized (e.g. progressed), we will use the chi -square 
(Fisher exact) test to compare proportions of outcomes between groups. These univariate analyses will be followed by [CONTACT_94104] (logistic) regression methods for an adjustment of all other potential 
confounding variables. Baseline factors associated with different groups will be also included in a 
multivariable model.  
 
When multiple time points are considered such as at baseline and 3 months, we wi ll model linear trajectories 
of outcome scores across time using mixed -effects (linear) regression models. The models will be specified 
with random intercepts and slopes such that a linear trajectory representing outcome scores will be compared between treatment groups. For example, longitudinal changes in all available continuous 
outcome scores over time of follow- ups will be displayed using locally weighted smoothing scatter (lowess) 
plots, identifying nonparametric mean trajectories over time. Mean trajectories will be then modeled with 
mixed -effects linear regression models, and if necessary using segment -linear models to approximate non -
linear mean trajectories for ease of interpretation. Treatment group -specific (as well as a individual -level) 
intercepts and slopes over the period of follow -up will be included as random effects, while other covariates 
will be modeled as fixed effects. All models will be adjusted for other clinical or demographic confounders. 
Residual -based diagnostics will be used to evaluate validity of model assumptions. Two sided p- values 
<0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant. All statistical procedures will be performed using R 
statistical package (www.R -project.org ). 
7.2 Sample Size Determination  
 
The patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to each main arm of the study, for a total of 120 knee OA 
subjects  (half colchicine and half placebo).  
 
Study number: s16-[ZIP_CODE] 
Version: JULY 25 2023

 Assuming normality, we calculated the statistical power for various detectable effect sizes in a two- sided 
hypothesis test with a significance level of 0.05, where a 1:1 ratio of sample size is assumed between 
cases (treatment) vs. matched controls (placebo). For outcomes that are proportions, we calculated power based on rate diff erences. The table below  shows that our sample size will have adequate power 
to detect the listed effect sizes. For example, we will achieve 86% power to detect a standardized mean difference of 0.50 between two groups of a size of 60 for each, which corresponds to a relative reduction by 50% in continuous outcomes. For dichotomous outcomes such as rates of MSK -US-measured 
synovitis and effusion, N=[ADDRESS_104025] size differs.

[ADDRESS_104026] Population(s) for Analysis  
 
Because the trial is short, and the anticipated rate of adverse events is low, we anticipate that most of the 
patients initiating the study will complete it.  Our primary analysis will be intention- to-treat, and will include 
all treated patients who received at least one dose of study drug /placebo.  We will also complete 
secondary analyses on only those patients who completed the study protocol to the end of 90 days, and 
exploratory analyses on subjects who were compliant with the study medications.   
8 Safe ty and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets a ll of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research ( i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  ( including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
A
dverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
Study number: s16-[ZIP_CODE] 
Version: JULY 25 2023 
 
31 | Page  
 • is considered by [CONTACT_15369] -serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening 
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 Subjects will be instructed to record the time of occurrence, duration and outcomes of any AEs in their 
subject diary.   
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events.  
 Adverse Event Reporting Period 
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study 
treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_104027] administration of study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The 
investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of  a subject that has participated 
in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following 
conditions is met:   
• T he laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
Study number: s16-[ZIP_CODE] 
Version: JULY 25 2023

 • The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessmen ts, further diagnostic investigation, 
etc. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28688] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any 
condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the 
criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse 
event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event  if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28690].  
Enrolled subjects will be asked to sign a medical release form so that the investigative site can easily 
retrieve any  medical records resulting from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94065].  
8.[ADDRESS_104028] seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be 
recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the 
case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal  diagnostic procedures results 
should recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
8.[ADDRESS_104029] be reported are those that are:  
• related to study parti cipation,  
• unexpected, and  
• serious or involve risks to subjects or others  
(see definitions, section 8.1).

Study number: s16-[ZIP_CODE] 
Version: JULY 25 2023 
 
34 | Page  
 Federal regulations require timely reporting by [CONTACT_94106].  The following describes the NYULMC IRB reporting requirements, 
though Investigators at participating sites are responsible for meeting the specific requirements of their 
IRB of record.  
 Report Promptly, but no later than 5 working days:  
Researchers are required to submit reports of the following problems promptly but  no later than 5 working 
days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:  
• Unanticipated problems including adverse events  that are unexpected and related  
– U
nexpected : An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent document 
and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.  
– Related to the research procedures : A n event is related to the research procedures if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821].  
– Harmful :
 either caused harm to subjects or others, or placed them at increased risk  
 Other Reportable events:  
The following events also require prompt reporting to the IRB, t hough no 
 later than 5 working days: 
• Complaint of a research subject when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol deviations or violations  ( includes intentional and accidental/unintentional deviations 
from the IRB approved protocol) for any of the following situations:  
– one or more participants were placed at increased risk of harm  
– the event has the potential to occur again 
– the deviation wa s necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm  
• B reach of confidentiality  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C 
and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• New Information indicating a change to the risks or potential benefits  of  the research, in 
terms of severity or frequency. (e.g. analysis indicates lower -than-expected response rate or a 
more severe or frequent side effect; Other research finds arm of study has no therapeutic value; 
FDA labeling change or withdrawal from market)  
  
R
eporting Process  
The reportable events noted above will be reported to the IRB using the form: “Reportable Event Form” or 
as a written report of the event (including a description of the event with information regarding its 
fulfillment of the above criteria, follow -up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other 
study documentation).  
 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_28693]’s study file.  
8.3.3  Sponsor reporting: Notifying the FDA  
 The study sponsor is required to report certain study events in an expedited fashion to the FDA.  These written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety reports. The following describes the 
safety reporting requirements by [CONTACT_28822]:  
 
Study number: s16-[ZIP_CODE] 
Version: JULY 25 2023 
 
35 | Page  
 • Within 7 calendar days (via telephone or facsimile report)  
Any study event that is :  
– associated with the use of the study drug  
– unexpected,  
– fatal or life -threatening  
 
• Within 15 calendar days (via written report)  
Any study event that is :  
– associated with the use of the study drug,  
– unexpected, and  
– serious, but not fatal or life- threatening  
-or- 
– a previous adverse event  that was not initially deemed reportable but is later found to fit the 
criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when event was deemed 
reportable).  
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that:  
– suggest a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
 Additional reporting requirements  
Sponsors are also required to identify in IND safety reports all previous reports concerning similar 
adverse events and to analyze the significance of the current event in light of the previous reports.  
 Reporting Process  
Adverse events may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A (MEDWATCH Form (see Appendix VIII), or in a 
narrative format. If supplied as in a narrative format, the minimum information to be supplied is noted 
above at the beginning of section 8.3. The contact [CONTACT_15373]:

Tel: 301- 796-4029  
Email: [EMAIL_1874]  
 
8.4 Unblinding Procedures  
 
Unblinding will be used in the case of any SAE which may be associated with the study drug.  
8.5 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_94066], 
the study is only 3 months long, and because the anticipated rate of adverse events is low, we do not anticipate the need to interrupt or stop the study. Nevertheless, a Data Monitoring Committee will be 
created and can determine the need to interrupt or stop the study if necessary.     
 Subjects are free to discontinue the study at any time.  
8.6 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted 
above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see 
section 9 Auditing, Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of 
the number and type of serious adverse events.  In addition, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94067]: s16-[ZIP_CODE] 
Version: JULY 25 2023 
 
36 | Page  
 independent safety monitor to make determinations about the nature of any adverse events. This 
individual will conduct his or her review every 6 months and the information will be shared with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_94068].  
8.6.1  Data Monitoring Committee  
 There is no need for a Data Monitoring Committee. However, monitoring the study is a critical part of its success.  Therefore, an internal clinical practitioners (to be determined) will be monitoring the study on a 
biannual basis.  This monitor will work with our clinical and regulatory study teams to ensure that all 
procedures and assessments are being conducted in compliance with the protocol and the informed consent.  
[ADDRESS_104032] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
9.1 Confidentiality  
 Primary research data will be stored at the NYU Langone Orthropedic Center (LOC).  The sample collection includes: synovial fluid, plasma, and serum samples. Subjects will mark in the consent form whether or not 
they agree to provide a synovial fluid sample. These samples will be stored at the Immunology Lab at the 
NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94069] [ADDRESS_104033], Rm 1600, [LOCATION_001], NY [ZIP_CODE]). The 
Immunology Lab is managed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mukundan Attur.  The samples will be stored for a maximum of ov er 
[ADDRESS_104034] for withdrawal will be kept on file by [CONTACT_94099].  
 
“True” genetic testing will not be done.  
 
It is believed the maximum allowance for time to hold samples will allow for significant analysis and 
improvement in understanding surrounding rheumatic disease. Source documents will be stored in study binders, which will remain in a locked room/cabinet at the study facility. All subjects will be assigned a 
unique four -digit study number and all subsequent questionnaires and samples will only be encoded with 
this numeric code and the date of collection. A link between patient name, contact [CONTACT_3031], and identifier will be retained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_94070]. These will be retained in a password -protected database 
with original CRFs retained in a locked cabinet in case report binders at LOC. The clinical database will be kept in a de- identified, passw ord-protected secure online REDCap database, created for this study. Only 
the principal investigators, co-investigators, and study coordinators will have access to this data. 
Information with subject names will not be used in any publications resulting from this investigation.  
 
For patients who are fully eligible, do not withdraw from the study or request that their samples be 
withdrawn, sample storage for future research is not optional and is a mandatory part of this research. While 
the study team plans to measure certain blood markers soon after each subject is enrolled in the study, stored samples would allow for further analysis as the understanding of osteoarthritis changes in the future.  
 When patient blood and questionnaires are obtained, they will be labeled with the appropriate unique numeric code and date of collection. All subsequent data analysis, specimen recording and samples will 
only be encoded with this numeric code and the date of collection. There will be no link between the 
informed cons ent forms and the subjects' samples.  
 
Chart reviews will require patient names. However, when the data is transferred from patient charts and 
medical questionnaires to the database, only the appropriate numeric code will be used as an identifier.  
 
Serum/ plasma will be collected from the study subjects. These samples will be stored in sterile plastic 
tubes in storage containers in locked –80
oC freezers in a locked room, and will be accessible only to 
Study number: s16-[ZIP_CODE]

 authorized study personnel. All stored samples will be identified by [CONTACT_94107], and stored at the Immunology Lab on the 16th Floor at the NYU Langone Orthopedic 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94069] [ADDRESS_104035] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period.  
9.3 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in 
source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_19093], microfiches,  photographic negatives, microfilm 
or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
9.4 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  I f the item is 
not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR 
WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the 
item, then initial and date it.  
9.5 Records Retention  
 It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_104036].  These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_16477].  In such an instance, it is the responsibility of the 
sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

APPENDIX V: Ultrasonography Form  
 
For evaluating the knees by [CONTACT_2207], there is no gold standard method in the literature.  
Thus we will capture 5 semiquantitative scores on a scale of 0- 3 (see below) for osteoarthritis, and 3 yes/no 
questions about crystal disease.  
 
1)    Size of effusion in the anterior suprapatellar space in the longitudinal view, anechoic and 
compressible, on a scale of 0- 3 (by [CONTACT_94085])  
2)    Degree of synovial hypertrophy (by [CONTACT_94086]) in the anterior suprapatellar space in the 
longitudinal view, hypoechoic and NOT compressible, on a scale of 0-3 
3)    Degree of synovitis by [CONTACT_94087],   on a scale of 0- 3 (none, scattered, less than 50%, greater than 50% of the area)   
4)    Size of osteophytes in the medial or lateral joint lines (whichever more severe) in the longitudinal 
view, hyperechoic, on a scale of 0- 3  
5)    Degree of femoral articular cartilage (FAC) wear in the suprapatellar transverse view with knee 
flexed, on a scale of 0-3 
6)    FAC double contour sign (hyperechoic line across top of anechoic FAC) in the suprapatellar 
transverse view with knee flexed:  yes/no  
7)    FAC evidence of C[COMPANY_003] (hyperechoic deposits in the middle of the anechoic FAC) in the 
suprapatellar transverse view with knee flexed: yes/no 
8)    meniscal evidence of C[COMPANY_003] (hyperechoic deposits in the triangular meniscus edges) in the 
medial and/or latera joint line:   yes/no

APPENDIX VI: Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
1. Types of Data or Events:  
All data collected under the study and schedule of events will be monitored and reviewed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_94074] (funding source).  
 
Events that would be specifically reviewed by [CONTACT_94112].   
Adverse events include:  
• GI upset  
• Soft stools/Diarrhea  
• Occassional nausea/vomiting  
In most cases at the dose being tested, these symptoms would be mild. Events that occur with an 
overdose of colchicine could include neuropathy, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, renal and bone marrow 
failure. However, this is unexpected at the doses tested in this study with the exclusion criteria. The 
occurrence of these at the doses and in the manner we are using the agent would be very rare as too 
be reportable. They are not a concern, but they would be reviewed by [CONTACT_94113]. The 
occurrence of any other unexpected events will also be noted.  
 
 
2. Responsibilities and roles for gathering, evaluating and monitoring the data:  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_94075] a 
timely manner after each participant visit.  Any unanticipated problems, SAEs or events meeting 
reportable IRB criteria will be submitted as per IRB and sponsor guidelines.  
• The roles of the investigators, research coordinators at the site will be documented on the delegation list for the study and signed by [CONTACT_978].  
• Data accuracy will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or primary data and safety monitor or designee 
upon first subject enrolled and every [ADDRESS_104046] a 
review of adverse events biannually.  
• The primary data and safety monitor or designee will verify compliance with the protocol by [CONTACT_94114]. Monitoring will occur 
upon first subject enrolled and biannually throughout the study. . 
3. Information about the monitoring entity:  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_94076], which is deemed appropriate due to:  
• the study is conducted at one site only  
• the narrow range of possible study events that could occur, supported by [CONTACT_94115]  
4. Reporting adverse events and unanticipated problems to the monitoring entity:  
• All adverse events will be recorded and followed by [CONTACT_464]/PI. They will be reported if they 
meet IRB and sponsor guidelines for reporting within specified time frame.  
• Specific forms or electronic submission will be used to report the events if they meet reporting criteria.  
• The coordinator will prepare and submit the form signed by [CONTACT_976].  
5. Assessments:  
Study number: s16-[ZIP_CODE] 
Version: JULY 25 2023 
 
44 | Page  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_94077], monthly, on all 120 
subjects.  Monitoring will include source data matches entered data and protocol compliance.  Events 
meeting reporting criteria as “unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others” (i.e., as 
to whether they are unexpected, related and harmful) will be reported to IRB and sponsor.  
 
6. Criteria for action:  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_94078].  This would be related to infections or new diagnosis or treatment in which 
study treatment would cause harm.  
• Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_94079], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], voluntary or PI [INVESTIGATOR_94080].  
7. Procedures for Communicating – dissemination of safety information  
As appropriate:  Electronically  
• Outcomes of monitoring entity reviews if needed will be provided electronically for communication 
to the IRB and/or research sponsor as needed.

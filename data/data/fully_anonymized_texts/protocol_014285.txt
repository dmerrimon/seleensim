1.Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim (s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be 
tested. 
To determine the
 effect of one dose of morphine, naltrexone and placebo on brain activity in 
healthy participants and patients suffering from pain.
To determine whether the
 effect of one dose  of morphine, /naltrexone and placebo on brain 
activity in healthy participants and patients suffering from pain is different depending on 
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) at the
 gene loci coding for opi[INVESTIGATOR_409777].  
To relate brain response to morphine to performance on reward related  decision-making 
tasks.

rest and in response to food in comparison to the administration of a placebo in a double blind 
design.  Also we would  like to study the acute effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine) administration in an 
open label arm. We are adding this arm to generate preliminary results to study the effect of 
Morphine using a simpler and less time consuming protocol where participation would be easier 
for subjects. We will relate performance on gambling, motivational and risk taking tasks to brain 
response to morphine.
 In addition, we would like to factor in individual genetic differences in dopamine and opi[INVESTIGATOR_409787] 20,30.

A. Description of the of the procedures for the double blind placebo controlled arm
Day 1) Phone screening 
During an initial telephone conversation, we will provide a brief description of the study, do an 
initial screening of the subject to ensure
 that they meet inclusion criteria and do not possess any 
of the exclusion criteria, and schedule the subject's intake session.  
Day 2) Intake session
Subject comes to The John B Pi[INVESTIGATOR_409790]. The subject will be asked to refrain from alcohol use the day before any session. The 
subject then completes a subset of the following intake measures to determine eligibility:  
A. Toxicology/pregnancy screening
We will perform the following screens:
i.
Breath alcohol levels will be assessed with the Alcohawk Elite Breathalyzer. 
ii. Urine
 toxicology screens will be conducted using the Integrated E-Z Split Key Cup II 
(Innovacon Inc., San Diego, CA) for opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], cocaine, THC, PCP and barbiturate. 
iii. We do not wish to study females who may be pregnant.  Therefore, all females of 
childbearing potential will
 be given a urine pregnancy test.
If a subject tests positive on any of these screens they will be informed of the result and excluded 
from further participation in the study. The results from these tests will not
 be recorded for 
subjects who are excluded for positive results.
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:
We will collect a saliva sample to genotype for SNPs related to dopaminergic and opi[INVESTIGATOR_409791]. The gene loci tested and their SNPs are attached.
Iowa Gambling Game: 
Iowa Gambling Task31: Designed to evaluate the ability to postpone immediate reward for a 
longer-term successful outcome, tests emotional decision-making ability. Subjects play a card 
game under conditions of limited knowledge about reward and penalty. The participant is 
presented with [ADDRESS_516822].  Two decks are advantageous (A and B); A and B do not give big 
gains but do not lead to losses after 100 draws.  Two decks are disadvantageous (C and D).  C 
and D give big gains but end up 
leading to big losses after 100 draws.  
Patients with inability to delay 
immediate gratification to improve 
long-term outcomes perform badly on 
this task.   The gains and losses will be 
in fake Monopoly money.

The EEfRT 32task is  a multi-trial game in which participants are given an opportunity on each 
trial to choose between two different task difficulty levels in order to obtain monetary rewards 
(see Figure) For all trials, participants made repeated manual button presses within a short period 
of time. Each button press raised the level of a virtual “bar” viewed onscreen by [CONTACT_2299]. 
Participants are eligible to win the money allotted for each trial if they raised the bar to the “top” 
within the prescribed time period. Each trial presented the subject with a choice between two 
levels of task difficulty, a ‘hard task’ and an ‘easy task’. Successful completion of hard-task 
trials required the subject to make [ADDRESS_516823] to make 30 
button presses, using the  dominant index finger within 7 seconds.
For easy-task trials,  subjects are eligible to win the same amount, $1.00, on each trial if they 
successfully completed the task. For hard-task choices, subjects are eligible to win higher 
amounts that varied per trial within a range of $1.24 – $4.30 (“reward magnitude”). Subjects are 
not guaranteed to win the reward if they complete the task; some trials are “win” trials, in which 
the subject receive the stated reward amount, while others are “no win” trials, in which the 
subject receive no money for that trial. To help subjects determine which trials are more likely to 
be winning trials, subjects are provided with accurate probability cues at the beginning of each 
trial. Trials had three levels of probability: “high” 88% probability of being a win trial, 
“medium” 50% and “low” 12%. Probability levels always applied to both the hard task and easy 
task, and there are equal proportions of each probability level across the experiment. Each level 
of probability appeared once in conjunction with each level of reward value for the hard task. All 
subjects received trials presented in the same randomized order.
All trials begin with a  1-second fixation cross, following a 5-second choice period in which 
subjects are presented with information regarding the probability of receiving reward and the 
reward magnitude of the hard task. Subjects are told that if they did not make a choice within [ADDRESS_516824] task for that trial. After 
making a choice, subjects are then shown a 1-second “Ready” screen and then completed the 
task. Following task completion, subjects are shown a 2 second feedback screen informing them 
that the task was successfully or unsuccessfully completed. If subjects successfully completed 
the task, then a second feedback screen appeared for 2 seconds in which subjects are told 
whether they had won money for that trial (reward feedback). In total, easy-task trials took 
approximately [ADDRESS_516825]-task trials took approximately 30 seconds.
Subjects are told that they would receive a base-rate of compensation for their participation. In 
addition, they 
are told that two of their win trials would be randomly selected at the end of the 
experiment as “incentive trials,” for which they would receive the actual amount won on those 
trials. Subjects are informed that they had twenty minutes to play as many trials as they could. 
Since hard-task trials take approximately twice as much time to complete as easy-task trials, the 
number of trials that the subject was able to play depended in part on the choices that he or she 
made. This meant that making more hard-task trials toward the beginning of the experiment 
could reduce the total number of trials, which could in turn mean that the subject would not get a 
chance to play high-value, high-probability trials that might have appeared towards the end of

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 1/5/2018 VALID THROUGH 8/8/2018Page [ADDRESS_516826] option could lead 
to an ‘optimal’ performance on the task. Moreover, the complexity of variables (with varying 
monetary reward levels, probability, and loss of time for future trials), does not lend itself to a 
formal calculation of an optimal response selection, and subjects are required to make decisions 
within a brief amount of time. This was done to help ensure that subject decisions reflected 
individual differences in the willingness to expend effort for a given level of expected reward 
value.  At the end of the experiment the subjects will receive the accumulated earnings in real 
money.
The EEfRT was programmed in Matlab (Matlab for Windows, Rel. 2007b. Mathworks Inc., 
Natick, MA) using the Psychtoolbox version
 2.0.
Decision making under uncertainty and risk
Participants will receive detailed 
explanations of the task26 and of the bonus 
payment (i.e. accumulated earnings) 
procedure and are required to pass task 
comprehension questions before completing 
practice trials. In the experiment itself, 
participants will be first given $100 
endowment to start playing. They will make 
60 binary choices between a certain gain of 
$5 and a bet of a monetary value (20 
amounts: $5–$20 in gains or losses) and 
probability of payout or loss (3 levels: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) are systematically manipulated. Each trial 
will be represented by [CONTACT_409833] a bag containing 100 colored poker chips, some red and some 
blue (See Figure); these images corresponded to physical bags that are present in the 
experimental room. The size of the colored areas and the numbers written inside indicate the 
number of chips of each color in the bag. Above and below each color, a number indicate how 
much a chip of that color would be worth if it are drawn from the bag.  Trial order will be 
randomized independently for each participant.  At the end of the experiment the subjects will 
receive the accumulated earnings in real money if they win money in addition to the $100.  If 
they lose money they will still receive a $100 for participation. 
Equipment training:
fMRI training
Subjects will be asked to lie in our fMRI simulator and will be outfitted with the taste 
delivery device and earphones that will play simulated fMRI scanner noises. The simulator 
consists of a padded table on which the subject lies supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. A removable wooden replica of 
the fMRI headcoil is placed over the subjects’ head. The gustatory manifold is anchored to

Small’s lab for the past 9 years33-35. All subjects will undergo a 10-minute mock fMRI run in 
which they receive the following stimuli:  sucrose, tasteless, and milkshake. The purpose of 
this mock run is to familiarize subjects with the procedures of the fMRI experiment and to 
teach subjects how to comfortably swallow while lying on a bed made to look like the MR 
scanner. Most people have no difficulty learning to swallow small quantities of liquid while 
lying down. Subjects who have difficulty with supi[INVESTIGATOR_409794], who are uncomfortable in 
the simulated MRI environment, or unable to swallow without excessive movement will not 
be asked to continue participating in the studies. This procedure takes 30 minutes. 
Meeting with the Physician and discussion of drug side effects:
Each 
participant will meet with [CONTACT_409865] to go over the possible side effects of [ADDRESS_516828] common side effects and will emphasize the risk of altered mental status (e.g. 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], drowsiness) after one dose of morphine. [CONTACT_409866] is Yale trained psychiatrist and 
will collect psychiatric history on possible previous misuse of alcohol, illegal drugs and 
prescription drugs.  Any subject with such previous history will be excluded from the study.  
In addition, each participant will be given a patient information sheet about each of the 
medications used in the study.
To avoid fatigue subjects will take a 5-minute breaks every 15-[ADDRESS_516829] meets
 all eligibility criteria we will schedule them for a Pre-
supplementation session at The John B Pi[INVESTIGATOR_57169]. 
Measurment of body fat composition:
We will 
measure body fat composition of our participants; body fat and body mass index can be 
confounding in 
our analysis given that brain response to food is different between obese and 
healthy weight participants36.  The BodPod body composition tracking system is an air 
displacement plethysmograph which uses whole-body densitometry to determine body 
composition (fat and fat-free mass).The BodPod is an egg-shaped pod that consists out of two 
chambers. The front, or Test chamber, is where the subject sits and is comprised of a seat that 
forms a common wall separating it from the rear, or reference chamber. During the brief data 
collection period of the volume measurement, the chamber door is secured by a series of 
electromagnets and a gasket. A diaphragm is mounted on the common wall, which oscillates 
during testing. This causes small changes in volume inside the chamber, of which the pressure 
response to these small volume changes is measured. This is done by [CONTACT_409835], then measuring it again when the subject is seated inside. 
By [CONTACT_58413], the subject's body volume is obtained. Once the subject's mass and volume are 
determined, body density is calculated and the relative proportions of fat and fat-free mass are 
determined. Thus this procedure is entirely non-invasive. A complete test requires about 5

provided by 
[CONTACT_409836]. The interior of the BodPod accommodates a wide variety of human 
shapes and sizes, including subjects up to 7 feet tall and 550 pounds. The egg-shaped design of 
the BodPod maximizes interior space, and can be used routinely for testing a wide variety of 
subjects, including special populations such as obese subjects. The BodPod's precision, accuracy, 
and reliability have been validated through independent research studies with various subject 
populations. The Bioelectric Impedance Analysis device (BIA) uses the flow of various low 
alternating electrical currents and measures impedance.  It produces estimates of total body 
water, extracellular water, fat-free mass and lean soft tissue for each limb and torso. It consists of 
a weighing platform that also contains foot electrodes (that the subject steps onto) and a bar with 
finger electrodes (that the subject holds onto with their hands). A complete measurement takes 
under [ADDRESS_516831] to change into separate garments. This system is 
routinely used in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], medical practices and inpatient care facilities in accordance with 
regulations. The BIA’s precision, accuracy and reliability have been validated through 
independent research studies.

(milkshake and 
tasteless) during two 9.6-minute runs and in response to sucrose and tasteless 
during two 9.6-minute runs. A run consists of multiple blocks of taste (milkshake or 
tasteless). One block is a series of 4 – 8 presentations of tastes or tasteless; Each presentation 
starts with a 0.75 cc delivery of liquid over 2 s followed by 7 s in which to swallow. Each 
taste block is followed by a rinse (0.75 cc deionized water). Before the start of a new block 
there is a rest period of 10 seconds. Blocks vary in length between 32 and 80 seconds and the 
order of blocks is counterbalanced across subjects. This design is modified from prior event-
related designs so as to yield a 61% improvement in design efficiency (calculated by 
[CONTACT_409837]’s software library FSL), which we confirmed to lead to more extensive and more 
intense BOLD response. The data can be analyzed offline and used for experimental control 
variables. Next, two 6 minutes resting state runs will be collected.  During these runs, 
participants  will be asked to stare at a cross-hair on the screen. Finally, a diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) scan will be obtained over [ADDRESS_516836].  DTI 
and structural imaging will not be repeated. Blood pressure and heart rate will be 
continuously monitored during  scanning using the Biopac system. The same procedure 
will be followed for the same participants in two subsequent visits (Day 4 and Day 5). The 
visits will be scheduled within a 
period spanning 4 weeks but no

A.Describe
i. the types
 of future research to be conducted using the materials, specifying if 
immortalization of cell lines, whole
 exome or genome sequencing, genome wide 
association studies, or animal studies are planned.
No future research is planned with the materials. We will determine the presence or 
absence of 
candidate opi[INVESTIGATOR_409797]-related genes after the subject has provided their 
saliva.
ii. the plan for the collection of material or the conditions under which material will 
be received
The Oragene-DNA
 Self-Collection Kit (vial format) will be used to collect DNA 
samples. This kit is an all-in-one system for the collection, preservation, and 
purification of DNA from saliva. The subjects will be asked to deliver the saliva in 
the container of the kit. After the delivery, the container will be capped which results 
in releasing DNA-preserving fluid that mixes with the saliva. This way, the DNA can 
be stored for long-term at room temperature. After collection, the DNA samples will 
be coded by a numeric code. This numeric code corresponds with the numeric code 
given to that particular subject in the study. The DNA samples will be analyzed in 
this lab using standard DNA procedures. Different sequence regions will be analyzed 
from each of the genomic DNA samples. The sequences will first be amplified using 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, based on primer sequences specific for 
each sequence of interest. The amplified PCR products will then be digested with 
restriction enzymes as appropriate and analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. 
Images of each processed gel will be taken using a cooled-CCD camera system 
(ChemiDoc, Bio-Rad) and the presence or absence of a given allele will be 
determined based on the predicted sizes of the PCR products.

materials, we will locate the material by [CONTACT_409839], and destroy the biological material and any 
paper or electronic record of their genetic information. The saliva sample will be

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 1/5/2018 VALID THROUGH 8/8/2018Page 21 of 52Healthy participants
Patients in pain: suffering from persistent pain more days than not, 3/[ADDRESS_516843] 6 weeks
 or more.
Exclusion criteria: Any DSM diagnosis, diabetes, food allergies, lactose intolerance, 
participants seeking to quit smoking or to lose weight, participants on any psychotropic 
medication including opi[INVESTIGATOR_409798] (e.g. oxycodone, methadone, suboxone), 
pregnant or nursing women, pacemaker or other implanted electrical devices. Participants 
with a past history of head trauma or seizures will be excluded.  Any past history of illegal 
drug or alcohol misuse will be an exclusion criterion.
8. How will eligibility be determined, and by [CONTACT_20898]? 
Eligibility will
 be determined  by [CONTACT_409842] a screening form (see attached phone screening form). The form asks general 
information questions (date of birth, handedness, native language, etc.) and queries the 
participants about their health and any history of conditions known to affect cognitive 
functioning (e.g. stroke, medications, head trauma), or any conditions that could 
compromise the safety of conducting an MRI scan (e.g. claustrophobia, metal in the 
body, pacemaker). A more lengthy MRI safety screening form will be administered 
when the participant arrives for the scanning session (see attached MRI screening 
form) at the Magnetic Resonance Research Center in the Congress Avenue building of 
Yale School of Medicine.  We do not wish to study females who are or may be pregnant.  
Therefore, as part of our MRI safety screening protocol, all females of childbearing 
potential will be given a urine pregnancy test prior to scanning.  Results of the 
pregnancy test will be given to them only and will remain confidential.  If the results 
indicate a subject is pregnant she will not participate in the fMRI scan, and will be 
excluded from the study.
9.Risks: Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to  subject privacy, 
discomforts, or inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research. 
Risk involved with the questionnaires 
It 
is possible that interviews may cause distress or concern to the participants. One potential 
risk to
 participants is that it may be distressing to disclose information about psychiatric 
difficulties such as previous history of substance misuse. In our estimation, there is a low risk 
of this possibility and the effects would probably be short lived. We have conducted several 
hundred of these interviews with no adverse effects. It is possible that subjects may become 
frustrated with some of the impulsivity or cognitive assessments. We have conducted 
hundreds of similar cognitive assessments and have had no adverse outcomes.

Risks associated with one dose of oral 30 mg Morphine:
Morphine 
is an opi[INVESTIGATOR_409799]. There is no clear 
compelling evidence of long-term toxicity from using one dose of 30 mg oral morphine. 
However, there are acute medical and neuropsychiatric sequelae that deserve special 
consideration.  Acute administration can lead to dizziness, somonolence, dysphoria, altered 
mental status, euphoria, edema, diaphoresis, headache, parasthesias, flushing, respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826], hypotension, rash or pruritis, nausea, constipation and vomiting.  Very serious 
but extremely rare side effects include anaphylaxis, apnea, severe bradycardia or 
hypotension, or shock.
Risks associated with one dose of oral 50 mg Naltrexone:
Naltrexone is
 an opi[INVESTIGATOR_409800]. There are 
no long-term side effects of one dose of oral naltrexone; in fact, naltrexone is prescribed 
daily for alcohol misuse disorder to prevent relapse into drinking. Acute administration can 
be associated with insomnia, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, headache, anxiety, abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting.  Extremely rare side effects include hypersensitivity reaction and 
hepatotoxicity. 
Risks involved with MRI
MRI and MRS are  considered to be among the safest ways to examine the human body.  
They use magnetism and radio waves, not x-rays, to measure chemicals and take pi[INVESTIGATOR_409801].  The [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set 
guidelines for magnet strength and exposure to radio waves, and we carefully observe those 
guidelines.  For subjects’ exposure in this study, no bad effects have been seen.  This study 
has no painful parts.  Subjects will be watched closely throughout the study.  Some people 
may feel uncomfortable or anxious during the MRI or MRS.  If this happens to a subject, 
they may ask to stop the study at any time and we will take him/her out of the MR scanner.  
On rare occasions, some people might feel dizzy, get an upset stomach, have a metallic taste 
or feel tingling sensations or muscle twitches.  These sensations usually go away quickly but 
subjects should tell the research staff if they have them.  
MRI and MRS pose some risks for certain people.  If subjects have a pacemaker or some 
metal objects 
inside their body, they may not be in this study because the strong magnets in 
the MR scanner might harm them.  Another risk is a metallic object flying through the air 
toward the magnet and hitting them.  To reduce this risk we require that all people involved 
with the study remove all metal from their clothing and all metal objects from their pockets.

The principal investigator, [CONTACT_409865],  will be responsible for  monitoring the data, assuring 
protocol compliance, and conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency, which must 
be conducted at a minimum of every 6 months (including when reapproval of the protocol is 
sought).  During the review process, the principal investigator (monitor) will evaluate whether 
the study should continue unchanged, require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. 
Either the principal investigator, or the IRB have the authority to stop or suspend the study or 
require modifications.
The risks associated with the current  study are deemed greater than minimal for the 
following reasons: (choose those that apply)
1. We do not view the risks associated with morphine or naltrexone as minimal risk.
2. We do not view the risks associated with the combined use of morphine or naltrexone 
and fMRI as minimal
 risks.
3. Given the now established safety and validity of the current _________ in our prior work, 
we do not view the proposed studies as high risk.
4.
Given our experience with the combined co-administration_________, we do not view 
the proposed studies as high risk.
Although we have assessed the proposed study  as one of greater moderate risk, the potential 
exists for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it 
is not possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of 
first-hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for 
monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as follows:
3. Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the 
study procedures / design by [CONTACT_409847], [CONTACT_409865],  according to the 
following categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible:
 Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely:
 Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational 
procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated:
 Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
4. Plan for Grading Adverse
 Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:

5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of
 Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse Events:
In addition to
 grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_96081] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it 
results in any 
of the following outcomes:
1. Death;
2. A life-threatening experience in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]; 
3. A persistent
 or significant disability or incapacity; 
4. A congenital
 anomaly or birth defect; OR
5. Any other adverse
 event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject’s  health and may
 require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed in this definition. 
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse 
Event.  Similarly,
 an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an 
SAE.  It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” 
when determining whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.
Plan for reporting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865] (including Adverse  Events) to the IRB
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_409804]: 
Any incident, experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria:
1. Is unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the 
research procedures described in the protocol-related
 documents, such as the IRB-
approved protocol and informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the 
subject population being studied; AND 
2. Is related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_409848]); AND
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, legal, or social
 harm) than was previously known 
or recognized.
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or 
non-medical in nature, and include – but are
 not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related 
adverse events and unanticipated adverse device effects.  Please note  that adverse events are 
reportable to the IRB as UPI[INVESTIGATOR_22417] 3 criteria listed above.
These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with  IRB Policy 710, using the

7. Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the 
protocol’s research monitor(s), e.g., industrial
 sponsor, Yale Cancer Center Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study 
sponsors, funding and regulatory agencies, and regulatory and decision-making bodies.

12.Statistical Considerations: Describe the  statistical analyses that support the study design. 
fMRI Data Analysis: The following measures will be derived from brain data: (1) parameter 
estimates(PE) for milkshake (MS) minus Tls (tasteless) (MS-Tls) will be defined at the 
single subject level using general linear model (GLM), implemented in FSL toolbox55;whole 
brain connectivity of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal, using both MS runs or 
resting state runs, will be calculated between each voxel, or region of interest (ROI), and 
every other voxel in the brain to obtain (2) functional connectivity FC of specific ROIs  or  
(3) degree maps (DM).  FC is a measure of the strength of connectivity between an ROI and 
the rest of the brain; degree D is calculated as the total number of connections above a 
specific correlation threshold between a voxel and all the other voxels in the brain; we will 
study D over a range of thresholds 0.25 < r <0.65 56.  DM identifies brain hubs (with high D) 
and therefore allows between groups comparison in the most densely connected areas 57,58.
The design is a within  subject repeated measures design with treatment  (Morphine, 
Naltrexone and Placebo) being the repeated measure and groups (healthy control vs. pain 
patients) as a factor.  We will use repeated measures ANOVA to find differences in brain 
response (i.e. (MS-Tls ) or D or FC) and psychophysical ratings of milkshake. The repeated 
measures design is a powerful one because it does not suffer from between subject

Oral Morphine is contraindicated in somebody who has bowel obstruction.
Oral Naltrexone: Oral Naltrexone is prescribed for alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_9825]; it is 
estimated that 221 million prescriptions of Naltrexone were dispensed in 2007 74.  The starting 
dose is 50 mg daily. Naltrexone has a wide margin of safety. Naltrexone has a low incidence of 
common adverse events75. Naltrexone’s FDA-approved label includes a black-box warning 
regarding hepatotoxicity, although these reversible effects tend to be associated with much 
higher doses than those used in routine clinical practice (e.g., 300 mg/day or more) and tend to 
occur only after a patient is on these high doses for extended periods.  For the purpose of our 
current protocol we will  use one 50 mg dose one time only.  In addition, there is no evidence of 
long-term toxicity associated with the intake of one dose of Naltrexone.  Naltrexone side effects 
occurring at > 10% rate are reported for combined oral and injectable form; however, as 
mentioned above oral Naltrexone has a low risk of side effects.

Since we perform our part of our screenings over the phone, it is impractical to obtain a 
written HIPAA 
authorization. Prior to obtaining consent, all participants will be screened 
on the phone by [CONTACT_23164]. During this phone conversation, the research 
coordinator will provide a brief description of the study, including information about the 
tasks the subject will have to perform, where the study is conducted, how long the entire 
study participation will take, and the amount of financial compensation. Subjects will then 
be asked to verbally consent to us asking them various questions to ensure that they meet 
inclusion criteria and do not possess any of the exclusion criteria. We will use the 
following language during our phone screening: “We will keep the information we just 
talked about in our files until you come in to the first session of the study. If you qualify 
and choose to be part of the study, this information will become part of your study file. If 
you don't come in or if you don't qualify for the study, we will keep this information until 
the study is over and then we will destroy it. We are required by [CONTACT_409853].” If the subject is eligible and willing to 
participate, the first session will be scheduled. At the beginning of this first session we will 
obtain Compound Consent and HIPAA Research Authorization.
By [CONTACT_25253], the investigator assures that the protected 
health information for which a Waiver of Authorization has been requested will not
 
be reused or disclosed to any person or entity other than those listed in this 
application, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of this research 
study, or as specifically approved for use in another study by [CONTACT_2717].
Researchers are reminded that unauthorized disclosures of PHI to individuals outside of  the Yale 
HIPAA-Covered entity must be accounted for in the “accounting for disclosures log”, by [CONTACT_55470], purpose, date, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and a description of information provided.  Logs are to be

9. Process of Consent/Assent:
 Describe the setting and conditions under which consent/assent will 
be obtained, including parental permission or surrogate permission and
 the steps taken to ensure 
subjects’ independent decision-making. 
Prior to obtaining consent, all participants will be screened on the phone by [CONTACT_409854] B Pi[INVESTIGATOR_57169]. During this conversation, the research coordinator 
will provide a brief description of the study, including information about tasks the subject will 
have to perform in the behavioral assessments, where the study is conducted, the medications used, 
the risks and benefits of paricipation, how long the entire study participation will take, and the 
amount of financial compensation. Subjects will also be screened to ensure that they meet 
inclusion criteria and do not possess any of the exclusion criteria. If the subject is eligible and 
willing to participate, the first session will be scheduled. Informed consent will be obtained 
immediately at the beginning of the first session. Personnel obtaining consent have a thorough 
understanding of the methodology of the protocol and a comprehensive knowledge of the 
procedures of the protocol and are capable of answering the possible questions raised by [CONTACT_409855]. A subject will sit down at a desk in a room. The study 
personnel will ask the subject to read through the entire compound research authorization and 
consent form. After the subject had read the entire form the researcher will verbally summarize the 
procedure, risks and steps taken to minimize risks. The subject is explicitly asked if they have any 
questions. All questions will be answered, except in the rare case that providing full disclosure 
may influence the outcome of the study (e.g. we do not want subjects to be aware that the puddings 
are manipulated in fat content). In these circumstances, the experimenter will explain that this is 
the case and offer to provide a fuller answer after the experiment. Subjects will receive additional 
details about the assessments they are to perform and will be informed that they may withdraw 
from the study at any time with no penalty. Subjects will be asked if they understand what the 
study entails and if they have had sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate. If 
a subject affirms she/he will then be asked to sign the compound consent form and research 
authorization form and given a copy (attached).
10. Evaluation of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent:  Indicate how the  
personnel obtaining consent will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent to the 
research being proposed. 
This research does not involve subjects with limited decision-making capacity. We will not recruit 
vulnerable subjects. For this reason we do not anticipate recruiting subjects without the ability and 
capacity to consent. However, we will ask subjects if they understand what the study entails and if
 
they have had sufficient information and opportunity to consider whether or not to participate.

d.    What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of    
the identifiable study data and the storage media indicated above during and after the 
subject’s participation in the study?
Do all portable devices contain encryption software?  Yes    No
         If no, see http://hipaa.yale.edu/guidance/policy.html
 
 None of the portable devices contain PHI or HIPAA identifiers, and  they are password 
protected. The 
identifying data is stored on a password protected database on a secure 
server in The John B Pi[INVESTIGATOR_57169]. Thus identifiers are not kept on the same device 
as the study information.
d. What will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy     
the identifiable 
data? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_22467]. 
If no, describe how the data and/or identifiers will be secured.
Identifying data are retained for a period of seven years  after publication.
e. Who will have access to the protected health information (such as the research sponsor, the  
investigator, the research staff,
 all research monitors, FDA, Yale Cancer Center Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), SSC, etc.)? (please distinguish between PHI and de-
identified data) 
As NIH is funding the study, rules governing NIH access will apply. No other entities 
besides research 
staff and the investigator will have access to PHI or de-identified 
data, with the exception of presentations of data. These are typi[INVESTIGATOR_409813]. Where individual data are reported, individuals are not identified

         SECTION  X: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1.     Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research?
The healthy
 participants for this study are not in need of treatment or seeking treatment. For this 
reason there is no alternative, except to decline participation in the study.
The pain participants might feel short-term relief of pain; If patients are interested in seeking 
such treatment they will be asked to talk
 to their doctor about it.
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations):  Describe any payments that 
will be made to subjects, the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for 
receiving this compensation. The subject’s payments for the open label and the randomized 
controlled study are the same per session completed. 
Remuneration is as follows for the randomized controlled study:
Type session: payment: frequency Total
behavioral assessment $ 80 x __1____ = $ __80___
fMRI scan with milkshake $ 100 * x __3____ = $ __300___
Computer Games $100 x __1____ = $ __100___
Subtotal: = $  380_____
Completion Bonus $ 50 x ___1___ = $ _50____
Accumulated Earnings Bonus x ___1___ = $ Variable___
Total payment: = $ _530_
And for the open label study:
Type session: payment: frequency Total
behavioral assessment $ 80 x 1 = $ 80
fMRI scan with milkshake $ 100 * x 2 = $ 200
Computer Games $100 x _____ = $100_____
Subtotal: = $ 280
Accumulated Earning Bonus $ = $ variable___
Completion Bonus $ 50 = $ 50
Total payment: = $ 430

instead be 
paid $50. If the subject spends more than 15 minutes, they will receive the full $100 
regardless of study completion.
Subjects will participate in one Intake Session ($80), 3 fMRI scanning sessions (with  milkshake, 
each $100), and a completion bonus of $50, leading to a maximal remuneration of $430. In 
addition to this, they make variable earnings depending on their performance on one of the 
computer tasks. 
3. Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs 
associated with participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that
 
will be provided at no cost to subjects.    
There are no costs to the subject.
 
4. In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk.
a.     Will medical treatment be available if research-related injury occurs? 
b.     Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? 
c.     Are there
 any limits to the  treatment being provided? 
d.     Who will pay for this treatment? 
e.     How will the
 medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]? 
If the subject is injured as a result of participation in  this study, treatment will be provided. The 
subject or the subject’s insurance carrier will be expected to pay the costs of this treatment. No 
additional financial compensation for injury or lost wages is available.

Page 7 of 37      CONFIDENTIAL  2. INTRODUCTION 
Pain Therapeutics  Inc. (PTI)  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_183412]-125, a novel drug candidate designed to 
treat and slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). PTI -125 binds with 
femtomolar affinity to filamin A (FLNA), a scaffolding protein we recently demonstrated 
is critical to beta amyloid’s toxicit y. Beta amyloid 1-42 (Aβ42) exerts its toxic effects by 
[CONTACT_183424] α 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( α7nAChR) and signaling via this 
receptor to hyperphosphorylate tau. In addition to disrupting the normal functions of α7nAChR and tau protein, this toxic signaling leads to the signature [CONTACT_183454]. In two animal models and in postmortem human AD 
brain tissue, PTI -125 restored function of three receptors that are impaired in AD: the α 7 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( α7nAChR); the NM DA receptor; and the insulin receptor 
(IR).
[ADDRESS_216658] PTI -125 to improve 
memory and slow or halt AD progression, which are clear improvements over existing 
therapeutics.  Both mouse m odels used a single efficacious dose equivalent to 20- 22 
mg/kg/day PTI -[ADDRESS_216659] mouse study administered twice daily i.p. 
injections of 10 mg/kg  (equivalent to 60 mg/m2) PTI-125. The second study delivered 22 
mg/kg/day (equivalent to 66 mg/ m2) via drinking water.  
A robust nonclinical ADME, safety pharmacology, and general and genetic toxicology program has been carried out with PTI -125.  In vitro m etabolic profiling showed minimal 
metabolism across several species  and in man.  PTI-125 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_183413] 100% oral bioavail ability, a 2.67- h 
half-life in dog, dose proportional PK and no accumulation. Safety pharmacology studies 
showed no adverse effects on gross behavioral and physiol ogical parameters in the 
Irwin test of CNS toxicity  in rats , no adverse effects on respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume or 
minute volume in the rat respi[INVESTIGATOR_148945] , and no adverse effects on arterial blood 
pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters i n the dog cardiovascular study. The in vitro 
hERG test for cardiotoxicity also indicated no adverse effect. A full battery of 
genotoxicity studies was conducted (in vitro bacterial Ames, in vitro chromosomal 
aberration, and in vivo rat micronucleus test) and were all negative. An in vitro specificity 
screen showed no significant activation or inhibition of a panel of 67 receptors, channels 
and transporters.   
PTI-125 was tested in single dose and repeat dose oral general toxicity studies in rats 
and dogs .  In a 28- day repeat dose oral general toxicity study followed by a 28- day drug -
free recovery period in rats, with PTI-125 dose levels up to and including 1000 
mg/kg/day (equivalent to 6,000 mg/m
2), toxicity was mainly characterized at 
1000 mg/kg/day by a decrease in mean body weight which continued during the 
recovery period. A diffuse cellular hypertrophy of the liver was seen at 1000 mg/kg/day 
in males and females and was interpreted as an adaptive response to the test article.   
There were no other adverse effects and all biologically significant findings noted during 
the dosing period were resolved at the end of the 28- day recovery period. A n o-
observed- effect -level (NOEL) could not be determined and t he no -observed- adverse-
effect -level (NOAEL) was determined to be 500 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 3,000 mg/m2).  
A 28 -day repeat dose oral general toxicity study in dogs, followed by a 28-day drug -free 
recovery period, with PTI-125 dose levels up to and including 200 mg/kg/day (equivalent 
Pain Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-0 1 
PTI-125, A novel small molecule for AD  15 June  2017 
Page 8 of 37      CONFIDENTIAL  to 4,000 mg/m2). Findings included slig ht muscle fasciculations in some animals at the 
high dose only, an increase in blood pressure in high dose females, and sporadic 
alterations in clinical chemistry profiles at the high dose. All observations resolved during 
the recovery period. An NOEL  could not be determined and the NOAEL was determined 
to be 100 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 2,000 mg/m2).  
It should be noted that in a 7- day non- GLP dose- range finding study in dogs, 
convulsions (rated “slight”) were observed in one of six animals administered 300 
mg/kg/day on Day 2 and Day 3. On Day 4, this dose was reduced to 150 mg/kg/day, 
and the high dose, 1000 mg/kg/day, was reduced to 200 mg/kg/day. Convulsions were not observed in the 1000/200 mg/kg/day animals.  
FDA Guidance
1 for estimating the maximum safe starting dose in initial clinical trials  was 
followed in determining the dose levels for this clinical  trial. A safe human starting dose 
of 1/10th the human dose equivalent of the NOAEL in the most sensitive species (dog) 
was calculated as [ADDRESS_216660] in human Phase I Single Ascending Dose 
(SAD)  study  will assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of  PTI-125 solution at three 
single oral doses  (50, 100 and 200 mg, equivalent to 31, 62, and 123 mg/m2, 
respectively ) in healthy normal volunteers.  
3. STUDY  OBJECTIVES 
The objective of this study  is to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics  of PTI-125 
following  single -dose oral administration in healthy male and female normal volunteers, 
age 18 - 45. 
4. SUMMARY OF STUDY DES IGN 
This is a Phase I, single center,  randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled, SAD 
study of three escalating doses of PTI -125 in healthy male and female volunteers , 18-45 
years of age.  A total of twenty -four (24) subjects  will be enrolled into the study in one 
of three dose cohorts . Each  cohort will contain 8 s ubjects ; six (6) subjects  will receive 
PTI-125 and two  (2) will receive placebo in each cohort . Three single ascending doses 
of PTI -125 oral solution ( 50, 100, and 200 mg) or placebo solution will be administered 
to respective cohor ts. 
The study  includes  a screening  period (Day  -28 to Day -1) and an inpatient  treatment  
period (Day  0 through Day 4) and a follow -up visit (Day 7) . Subjects  will report  to clinic  
the day before dosing  and will be randomized to receive either a single dose of orally 
administered PTI -[ADDRESS_216661] of 10 h.  
For each dose level, dosing will be staggered such that 2 subjects  (one active and one 
placebo) will be dosed prior to the rest of the group. A fter a minimum of 24 h and review 
of all 24- h safety assessments (ECG, brief physical, vital signs and laboratory

9. ADVERSE EVENTS/SERIOUS ADVER SE EVENTS   
9.1. ADVERSE EVENTS - DEFINITION  
An adverse event  (AE) is any undesirable event  that occurs  to a subject  during  a 
study,  whether  or not that event  is considered study  drug-related. Monitoring for AEs 
will start at dosing.  Examples  include:  
• Any treatment -emergent  signs  and symptoms  (events  that are marked by a 
change from the subject's  baseline/entry  status  [e.g., an increase in severity  or 
frequency  of pre-existing  abnormality  or disorder])  
• All reactions  from study  drug,  an overdose,  abuse of drug,  withdrawal  
phenomena,  sensitivity  or toxicity  to study  drug 
• Apparently  unrelated illnesses  
• Injury  or accidents  (Note:  if a medical  condition is known to have caused the

PTI-125, A novel small molecule for AD  15 June  2017 
Page 17 of 37      CONFIDENTIAL  injury  or accident,  the medical  condition and the accident  should be reported as 
two separate medical events  [e.g., for a fall secondary  to dizziness,  both 
"dizziness"  and "fall" should be recorded separately])  
• Extensions  or exacerbations  of symptoms,  subjective subject -reported events,  
new clinically  significant  abnormalities  in clinical laboratory,  physiological  testing  
or physical  examination 
 
All AEs,  whether  or not related to the study drug,  must  be fully and completely  
documented on the AE page of the Case  Report  Form  (CRF)  and in the subject's  
clinical chart.  
In the event  that a subject  is withdrawn from the study  because of an AE, it must  be 
recorded on the CRF as such. The subject  should be followed and treated by [CONTACT_183431].  
 
The Investigator  must  report  all directly  observed AEs and all spontaneously  
reported AEs.  The Investigator  will ask the subject  a non-specific  question (e.g., 
"Have  you noticed anything  different  since  your dose of the study  medication?")  to 
assess whether  any AEs have been experienced since  the last assessment.  AEs 
will be identified and documented on the AE CRF in appropriate medical  
terminology.  The severity  and the relationship to the study  drug will be determined 
and reported on the CRF (see below).  
 
9.2. ADVERSE EVENTS - SEVERITY RATING  
The severity  of each AE should be characterized and then classified  into one of 
three clearly  defined categories  as follows:  
• Mild - the AE does  not interfere in a significant  manner  with the subject's  
normal functioning  level.  It may be an annoyance.  
• Moderate - the AE produces  some impairment  of functioning,  but is not 
hazardous  to health.  It is uncomfortable  or an embarrassment.  
• Severe - the AE produces  significant  impairment  of functioning  or 
incapacitation and is a definite hazard to the subject's  health.  
These three categories  are based on the Investigator's  clinical judgment,  which  in 
turn depends  on consideration of various  factors  such  as the subject's  report,  and 
the physician's  observations.  The severity  of the AE should be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the Adverse Event  CRF.  
9.3. ADVERSE EVENTS  -  RELATIONSHIP  TO STUDY  DRUG 
The relationship of each AE to the study  drug will be classified  into one of three 
defined categories  as follows:  
• Unlikely  - a causal  relationship between the AE and the study  drug is 
Pain Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-0 1 
PTI-125, A novel small molecule for AD  15 June  2017 
Page 18 of 37      CONFIDENTIAL  unlikely.  
• Possible  – a causal  relationship between the AE and the study  drug is 
possible.  
• Probable - a causal  relationship between the AE and the study  drug is 
probable.  For example,  the AE is a common adverse event  known to occur  
with the pharmacological  class the study  drug belongs  to; or the AE abated on 
study  drug discontinuation and reappeared upon rechallenge with the study  
drug 
These three categories  are based on the Investigator's  clinical judgment,  which  in 
turn depends  on consideration of various  factors  such  as the subject's  report,  the 
timing  of the AE in relationship to study  drug administration/discontinuation,  the 
physician's  observations  and the physician's  prior exper ience.  The relationship of the 
AE to the study  drug will be recorded in the appropriate section of the Adverse 
Event  CRF.  
9.4. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNEXPECTED ADVERS E EVENTS - DEFINITIONS  
Any AE that suggests  a significant  hazard,  contraindication,  side effect  or precaution 
is defined as a Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE).  An SAE includes  (but is not limited  
to) an experience occurring  at any dose that results  in any of the following  
outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  event  (i.e., the subject  is at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction as it occurs).  "Life-threatening"  does  not include an event  that, had it 
occurred in a more  serious  form,  might  have caused death.  For example,  drug- 
induced hepatitis  that resolved without  evidence of hepatic  failure  would not be 
considered life-threatening  even though drug-induced hepatitis  can be fatal.  
• In-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105904],  not an emergency  room  visit) or 
prolongation of  existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• A persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  (i.e., a substantial  disruption of 
the subject's  ability  to carry  out normal  life functions) . 
• A congenital  anomaly/birth defect . 
 
In addition,  medical  and scientific  judgment should be exercised in deciding  whether  
other  situations  should be considered an SAE (i.e., important  medical  events  that 
may not be immediately  life-threatening  or result  in death,  but may jeopardize the 
subject  or may require medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent  one of the other  
outcomes  listed  in the definition above). Examples  of such  medical  events  include 
(but are not limited  to): allergic  bronchospasm  requiring  intensive treatment  in an 
emergency  room  or at home,  blood dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not result  in 
in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
An unexpected  AE is one for which  the specificity  or severity  is not consistent  with 
the current  Investigator's  Brochure.  For example,  hepatic  necrosis  would be 
Pain Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-0 1 
PTI-125, A novel small molecule for AD  15 June  2017 
Page 19 of 37      CONFIDENTIAL  unexpected (by [CONTACT_183432])  if the Investigator's  Brochure only listed  
elevated hepatic  enzymes  or hepatitis.  
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected 
(by [CONTACT_149030] ) if the Investigator's  Brochure only listed  cerebral  
vascular  accidents.  
9.5. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING  
The reporting  of SAEs  by [CONTACT_183433]  (e.g., FDA)  is a 
regulatory  requirement.  Each  Regulatory  Agency  has established a timetable for 
reporting  SAEs  based upon  established criteria.  Likewise,  it is the responsibility  
of the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_183416]/IRB.  
All SAEs  must  be reported immediately  (within  24 h of learning of the event)  by 
[CONTACT_183434]:

Pain Therapeutics,  Inc.  
Email: [EMAIL_3593]  
Phone:     925- 788-[ADDRESS_216682]  also be reported to the responsible EC/IRB  
immediately.  
 
In the case  of a death or other  SAE that has occurred within  [ADDRESS_216683]  also report  such  an event  
within  24 hours  of being  notified. Your  local EC/IRB  may also require these 
reports.  
In the event of  any SAE (other  than death),  the subject  will be instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_7536] (Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_1461])  using the phone 
number  provided in the Informed  Consent  Form.  All subjects  experiencing an 
SAE will be seen by a Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_183417].

Page 20 of 37      CONFIDENTIAL  10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1.  RANDOMIZATION  
Subjects will be assigned to PTI -125 or placebo based on a computer -generated 
randomization schedule prepared prior to the study. Pain Therapeutics, Inc. (PTI) will 
interact with the pharmacy to have study drug for each subject labeled according to this randomization code. Randomization Numbers will be used as subject code 
numbers and will be assigned when qualified subjects are randomized.  
The randomization code will not be revealed to study subjects, investig ators, clinical 
staff or study monitors until all subjects have completed therapy and the database has been finalized and closed.   
Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken. The blind may be broken only if specific emergency treatment is indicated. The date, time and reason for the unblinding must be documented on the case report form, and the medical monitor 
must be informed as soon as possible.  
10.2.  A
NALYSIS POPULATIONS  
All subjects  who receive study  medication will be included in safety  analy ses. All 
subjects who have sufficient data for PK analysis will be included in the PK analysis  
population.  
10.3.  PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS  
PK parameters for  PTI-125 will be calculated using non- compartmental methods in 
WinNonlin. The peak drug concentration (C max), the time to peak drug concentration 
(Tmax), T last and C last, the  time to and concentration of the last quantifiable drug 
concentration, will b e obtained directly from the data without interpolation.   The 
following parameters will be calculated: the elimination rate constant ( λz), the terminal 
elimination half -life (T 1/2), the  AUC from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable 
concentration (AUC last), the AUC from time  zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC inf), and 
the percentage of AUC inf based on extrapolation (AUC extrap(%)), Cl/F, the apparent oral 
clearance, and Vz/F, apparent volume of distribution.  
 
In the pharmacokinetic analysis, BLQ concentrations will be  treated as zero from time -
zero up to the time at which the first quantifiable concentration was  observed; 
embedded and/or terminal BLQ concentrations will be  treated as “missing”.  Full 
precision concentration data (not rounded to three significant figures) and actual  
sample times will be  used for all pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses.  Nominal  
sampling  times  will be used to prepare concentration versus time profiles . 
 
Pain Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-[ADDRESS_216684], and AUC inf for PTI -125 between 
treatments will be done using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with factors for 
period and treatment.  T max will be compared among  groups  using  a non-parametric  
analysis  (Wilcoxon  Rank  Sum or Signed Ranks  tests).  
 
10.5.  SAFETY  ANALYSIS  
Adverse events  reported on case  report  forms  will be mapped to preferred terms  
and organ systems using  the MedDRA  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_169231].  Vital signs  and clinical 
laboratory  results  will be descriptively  summarized in terms  of change from 
screening  values.  
10.6.  SAMPLE SIZE 
24subjects  will be enrolled in this study.  Sample size was determined by [CONTACT_183435]-transformed data from previous  studies  of new 
chemical entities ( NCEs ).

The investigator is being paid by [CONTACT_456] (the company paying for this study) to conduct this research study.  
 You must be honest with the investigator about your health history or you may harm yoursel f by 
[CONTACT_4907].  
 
THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY IN WHICH THE STUDY DRUG IS BEING GIVEN TO 
HUMANS.  
 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 
In this document, you may see the terms “medication”, “treatment”, and “treatment period”; these are 
terms used in research studies as mentioned above.  This does not mean that you will be receiving 
Pain Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-[ADDRESS_216689]. 
 The purpose  of this study is to measure the blood levels of Pain Therapeutics, Inc.’s  new 
investigational drug PTI -125, and to determine if there are any side effects associated with the drug. 
PTI-125 is intended to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease as well  as provide some cognitive 
recovery .  
  
"Investigational" means the study drug being tested is not approved by [CONTACT_6581] (FDA).  If you qualify for the study, you will receive three doses of PTI -125 (investigational pro duct) , listed 
below, or three doses of placebo. Each dose (active or placebo) will be separated by a 3 -day drug -
free (washout) period. The first two subjects (sentinel group) in the group will receive the first dose 
of study drug or placebo and the rest of  the group will receive their assigned dose at least 24 hours 
later unless it is determined that an additional sentinel group is necessary.  
• A single 50 mg dose of oral solution of PTI -125 or placebo oral solution  
• A single 100 mg dose of oral solution of PTI -125 or placebo oral solution  
• A single [ADDRESS_216690] about 11 days, excluding  the screening period, and involve up to 10 
nights at the facility. About 16  healthy men and women, ages 18 through 45, are expected 
to be in this study.  
TO BE IN THIS STUDY  
You cannot be in this study if you:  
 
• Are in an other research study or if you have been in any other research study in which you 
received study drug within [ADDRESS_216691] dose of study formulation 
• Are taking any drugs of abuse (illegal and/or prescription).  A urine test will be performed to 
check for the use of these drugs. You may be observed during any urine sample collection 
process.  
• Have donated blood within [ADDRESS_216692] Responsibilities:

While participating in this research study, you will n eed to:  
 
• Be willing and able to follow the study directions and procedures  
• Tell the study staff about any side effects or problems 
• Ask questions as you think of them  
• Tell the investigator or the study staff if you change your mind about staying in the study.  
 
This study involves testing an investigational drug developed by [CONTACT_456]. We ask subjects to keep  
information as confidential as possible. This would include not sharing details of the study, including  
requirements for participation, information re ceived on the risks and benefits of dosing with this 
study  drug, and symptoms or reactions to study drug dosing while enrolled in the study, with persons 
other than the clinic staff, your family and your healthcare provider. This would also include not 
disclosing such  information on social media sites or webpages.  
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY  
Screening  
 
Before the study starts, you will be asked to sign this consent form, give your health and social 
history, and tell study staff if you take any over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins , or 
herbs.  
 
The investigator will do some tests to find out if you can be in the study. These tests include:  
 
• Physical exam, including vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart and breathing rates), 
height and weight   
• An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be taken -  this is a recording of the electrical activity of your 
heart  
• Lab tests (blood and urine)  
• Blood test for HIV and hepatitis B and C  
• Urine test for drugs of abuse (illegal and/or prescription)  and c otinine (tobacco)  
• Alcohol breath test will be done  
• Urine  pregnancy tests for female participants of childbearing potential  
 
The Screening Visit may take up to 2 hours and 30 minutes of your time. 
 
If you qualify for the study, you will return to the clini c for the three Treatment Periods.  If you are 
more than 1 hour late to your study check in, you may  be placed in alternate/backup status.  
 
 Study Procedures

• You will be asked about any changes in your health or drugs you have taken since your last visit  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate  and temperature) will be taken prior to 
receiving each dose of study drug  
• If you are female of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed  at check in  
• A urine sample will be taken  at check in  – the urine tests will include finding out if you have 
used any cotinine  or drugs of abuse (illegal and prescription) . You may be observed during any 
urine sample collection process.  
• An alcohol breath test will be done at check -in to ensure you have not recently consumed alcohol  
• An optional snack will be given the evening of check -in at the clinic  
 
Treatment  Periods 1, 2 and 3 
 
• Standard meals will be given at scheduled times during each stay in the clinic 
• You will have to fast (nothing to eat or drink except water) for at least 10 hours before taking 
study drug  and for 4 hours after dosing  
• You will be randomly assigned, like the flip of a coin, to take PTI -125 or placebo. 
• You will take an oral solution of the assigned study drug or placebo. The study staff will perform a mouth check to ensure that the solution is swallowed completely. 
• Aside from the oral solution and two rinses of the dosing syringe with water, you may not drink 
any other water from 1 hour before dosing through 1 hour after dosing . At other times duri ng the 
study, you can drink water. 
• After taking the study drug  you will not be allowed to lie down for the first 1- [ADDRESS_216694] 
stay seated during that time 
• The level of study drug  in your blood will be measured.  About 3/4 teaspoon (4 mL) of blood 
will be taken at multiple time -points during your stay in the study clinic  
• Vital Signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate) will be performed at multiple time points during the study  
• A physical exam will be conducted at 48 hours after  each dose of study drug or placebo  
• An electrocardiogram (ECG; a recording of the electrical activity of your heart) will be conducted at 48 hours after each dose of study drug or placebo.  
• Lab tests (blood and urine)
  
• You will be monitored for any side e ffects  
 
If you leave the study early or are withdrawn the following procedures will be performed:  
• Vital Signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart and breathing rates)  
• Physical examination  
• Lab tests (blood and urine)  
• Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
 
Blood Sam ples: 
 
Blood samples will be taken by [CONTACT_183442]- sticks or by a tube that is left in your arm.  You cannot

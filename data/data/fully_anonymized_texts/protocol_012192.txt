1 Précis  
Macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel), a bilateral degenerative condition of the macula that 
may cause progressive loss of vision, is estimated to have an incidence of 1:22,000 (Lamoureux 
et al. 2011). A recent study (Chew 2015)  correlating visual field defects detected by 
[CONTACT_410039] -/-outer -segment junction, 
indicating that loss of vision in MacTel is caused by [CONTACT_410040]. Current evidence 
implies that photoreceptor cell loss is intrinsic to the disorder rather than being consequent upon blood vessel changes. Photoreceptor abnormality occurs early in the disorder and progressio n 
of photoreceptor cell loss is not influenced by [CONTACT_410041] -
VEGF treatment. To date, there is no effective treatment for MacTel.  
The class of molecules called “neurotrophic  factors” has been demonstrated to reduce the rate 
of photoreceptor cell loss during retinal degeneration. One of these, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), was found to be effective in slowing vision loss from photoreceptor cell death in 12 animal models of outer retinal degeneration (e.g., rd/rd, rds/rds, 334ter -3 rats, 334ter -4 rats, 
P23H -1 rats, Rdy cats, rcd1 dogs, etc.). Similarly, delivery of a neurotrophic factor to the outer 
retina in a mouse model that shares many phenotypic MacTel characteristics  has shown 
profound functional and anatomic photoreceptor cell rescue without correcting associated vascular abnormalities (Dorrell 2009). In addition, there is evidence that CNTF can cause regeneration of cone outer segment in rats with mutations in the rhodopsin gene (McGill 2007). 
Further, encapsulated cell delivery of CNTF has been tested in three human Phase 2 safety 
studies in the treatment of retinal dystrophies and atrophic age -related macular disease. 
Specifically, CNTF did not cause neovascularization in either disorder, both of which are recognized as being associated with the development of abnormal blood vessels. In these studies, there is some evidence of therapeutic benefit (Sieving 2005 and Talcott , 2010). The 
combined evidence from animal and human studies suggests that use of neurotrophic molecules may provide therapeutic benefit to patients with MacTel.  
One major challenge is the delivery of this potential therapeutic CNTF agent to the back of the eye, and in particular, to the retina. The blood- retinal barrier prevents the penetration of a 
variety of molecules to the neurosensory retina from plasma in a manner similar to the action of the blood- brain barrier, which exists between the central nervous system and systemic 
circulation. To overc ome this challenge, Neurotech Pharmaceuticals (Neurotech) developed 
IND 10,931  Page 1 
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.0 October 4, 2016 
encapsulated cell technology (ECT), and specifically the NT -[ADDRESS_517125] of the intraocular NT -501 
implant in 7 participants with bilateral MacTel. The primary outcome was the safety of the NT-501 implant and the associated surgical procedure. We found the implanting of the NT- 501 was 
safe as demonstrated by [CONTACT_410042]  (Chew 2015).  
2 Background and Rationale  
In 1982, Gass et al.
 published the seminal paper on macular telangiectasis (then called 
juxtafoveal or parafoveal telangiectasia). In further work, Gass et al. (Gass 1987 and Gass 1993) subdivided macular telangiectasia into three groups : Type 1: the telangiectasia is usually 
unilateral and associated with dilated retinal capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], leakage on fluorescein angiography and 
retinal thickening in mostly male patients. Type 2: Macular Telangiectasia (MacTel), leakage occurs during fluorescein angiography with manifest retinal capi[INVESTIGATOR_410019], and Type 3: [ADDRESS_517126] common form of macular telangiectasia, is the disease evaluated in this study. This condition is typi[INVESTIGATOR_410020]. This disorder is  characterized by [CONTACT_410043], superficial retinal crystalline 
deposits, retinal opacification and right -angle venules. As the disease progresses, intraretinal 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_410021]/subretinal neovascularization may develop.  
In 2005, a prospective natural history study was initiated to define the clinical aspects of 
macular telangiectasia type [ADDRESS_517127] now 
been described that alter our concept of the disorder’s pathogenesis. One of the ear liest signs is 
IND 10,931  Page 2 
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.0 October 4, 2016 
loss of luteal pi[INVESTIGATOR_410022] a 
confocal laser ophthalmoscope. Optical coherence tomography has shown abnormalities in 
photoreceptors early in the disease which is associated with significant loss of scotopic and photopic function beginning nasal to fixation ( Charbel -Issa 2010) . This gives rise to pre-
fixational blindness. With adaptive optics imaging it has become evident that cone loss is an early characteristic of the disease (Ooto 2011). Thus, this photoreceptor loss  is intrinsic to the 
disorder, occurs early in the evolution of disease and may precede vascular change. In addition, it has been shown that (1) anti -VEGF treatment causes reversal of the blood vessel changes 
but does not influence progression of photoreceptor cell loss or functional loss; (2) the retina is thinner than normal in MacTel, unlike other macular conditions such as diabetic retinopathy in which edema can lead to retinal thickening; and (3) there is leakage of dye during fluorescein 
angiography similar to the leakage around the perifoveal area found in the deeper retinal 
circulation associated with retinal degeneration. It is also evident that opacification of the retina occurs very early in disease that is not due to retinal edema. Histopathological examination of a single post mortem eye taken from a patient with long -standing MacTel shows an abnormality of 
Mueller cells that might explain the retinal opacification if they act normally as light guides, as has recently been suggested (Reichenbach 2010), and a second pair of post -mortem eyes also 
show similar results (data not published). The role of the Mueller dysfunction in this condition requires further clarification.  
The promise of growth factors, neurotrophic factors and cytokines as therapy for neuro-
degenerative retinal diseases has been demonstrated in many animal models. The results of 
these studies using CNTF are summarized in Table 1. CNTF may have the potential for the treatment of Mac Tel type 2.

Using the rapid retinal degeneration rat RP model (S334ter -3 rat), one eye was selected and 
given an intra- vitreal  injection of either NTC -201 cells (which express CNTF) or NTC -200 cells 
(the parent line for NTC -201 that do not express CNTF). The contralateral eye served as a 
same- animal control. At the end of this study, eyes injected with NTC -201 cells had 5- 6 layer s of 
photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) while eyes injected with NTC -[ADDRESS_517128]

Histopathologic studies in naturally occurring and genetically engineered animal models of 
photoreceptor dysfunction and death, phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_410023] (RP), have 
indicated the promise of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) as an effective therapeutic agent for 
reducing photoreceptor loss associated with degeneration of the cells of the outer retina. CNTF is one of several neurotrophic factors that are produced endogenously by [CONTACT_410044]. CNTF has been demonstrated to be highly effective in retarding photoreceptor neuron loss in [ADDRESS_517129] on the photoreceptors. The treated eyes in the dog study had 5- 6 layers in the ONL compared to 2- 3 layers in the untreated eyes.  
3 Scientific Rationale  
3.1 Encapsulated Cell Technology (ECT)  
This study is designed to provide long term observation of the ongoing effect of CNTF as 
delivered continuously via the NT- 501 implant in patients with MacTel type 2. MacTel type 2 is a 
slowly progressive condition which may take many years to develop clinical symptoms and 
signs.  
The Phase II NTMT -02 trial  was limited to 24 months of controlled observation. While it is 
anticipated that two years of controlled observation should be sufficient to determine efficacy , it 
is possible that a longer period is necessary to observe a meaningful separation between the groups. This extension study provides the opportunity for that continued observation.  
Previous experience with the NT- 501 implant in studies of participants with geographic atrophy 
or retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_410024] 66 months. Output of CNTF from explanted devices, along with vitreous levels of CNTF, is 
consistent with the histologic findings at these various time points; the cells remain healthy and productive within the membranes (capsules), and continue to produce and deliver CNTF. These data support the hypothesis that NT-501 will continue to provide similar levels of CNTF to the 
IND 10,931  Page 5

study eyes during this prolonged follow up period. Mean duration of implantations together with 
explant and vitreous CNTF levels are shown in Table 2.

The Phase I NTMT -01 trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of the NT -501 implant 
in patients diagnosed with MacTel type 2 has completed enrollment (N=7) and follow -up 
continues. No serious adverse reactions have been reported to date. Preliminary data confirm 
that the progression of visual impairment is slow in MacTel type 2. This is consistent with the findings of Heeren et al ( 2015) who suggested that patients with MacTel type 2 require 
prolonged follow up for appropriate evaluation of functional loss . 
4 Study Objectives 
• To investigate long term safety and efficacy of the NT- 501 implant in participants 
previously enrolled in the NTMT -01 and NTMT -02 protoco ls. 
• To investigate the change in the ellipsoid zone (area of [inner/outer segment] IS/OS 
loss) in participants previously enrolled in the NTMT -01 and NTMT -02 protocols, as 
measured by [CONTACT_410036]  
(SD-OCT) in  study eye(s).

MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.[ADDRESS_517130] completed 60 months of follow up in the open label NTMT -01 study 
(Cohort 1) and the 66 participants who completed 24 months of follow up in the NTMT -02 study  
(Cohort 2). All participants will be followed for an additional 48 months.  Appendix 1 presents the 
scheduled examinations during the extended 48 month follow  up period.  
In the event that the NTMT -02 study is positive, Cohort 2 participants  who received sham only  
may be eligible for active treatment in the control/non- treated eye.

6.1.3   Safety Outcomes  
The following ocular events (regardless of attribution) will be considered safety outcomes  for 
both Cohorts  if they occur:  
• Rejection or extrusion of the NT -501 device.  
• Development of peri -implant fibrosis, which either blocks the visual axis of the 
implanted eye or affects the lens  or retina (minor/moderate fibrosis around the 
implant and/or the attachment point is an expected possibility and will be considered 
safe on ocular function). Attention should focus on fibrosis that may detach the retina.  
• Development of choroidal or retinal neovascularization in the study eye.  
• Adverse events affecting ocular function, which are different from those expected in 
the normal course of MacTel, which are potentially related to the surgical procedure, 
implant or CNTF including:  
− Endophthalmitis  
− Vitreal inflammation  
− Tractional retinal detachment  
IND 10,931  Page 8 
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.0 October 4, 2016 
− Sectorial lens opacification 
− Intraocular hemorrhage  
− High or low Intraocular pressures  
− Dry eye  
− Self-reported change in dark adaptation  
− Miosis  
− Persistent chemosis  
− Scleral leak  
All adverse events (AEs) will b e captured from the date of the Extension Study Consent  whether 
or not considered to be related to the surgical procedure, NT-501 device, or CNTF . All adverse 
events occurring between the final NTMT -01 or  NTMT -02 study visit will be considered part of 
the participants’ Medical and/or Ophthalmic History.  
An attempt will be made to differentiate between treatment- related AEs and AEs considered to 
be part of the normal progression of the disease. In addition,  for treatment -related AEs, an 
attempt will be made to differentiate those the Investigator believes are due to the procedure, 
NT-[ADDRESS_517132] meet  all of the following criteria:  
1. Previous ly enrolled in the NTMT -01 or NTMT -02 protocol and received the NT-501 implant 
and/or underwent a Sham procedure. 
2. Participant must be offered sufficient opportunity to review and to understand the informed 
consent form, agree to the form’s contents and provide written i nformed consent . 
6.3 Exclusion Criteria  
There are no Exclusion Criteria.  
6.4 Study Procedures 
All study procedures will be carried out for both eyes  at each visit. This will include both the 
study eye(s) and the fellow eye as applicable.

Recording of concomitant medications on the Case Report Forms (CRFs) must be done according to the instructions provided in the study Manual of Procedures (MOP).  In addition, all ocular and non -ocular procedures must also be recorded in 
the Concurrent Procedures source document . 
6.6 Prohibited Medications  
Anti-herpetic nucleoside analogs (such as  Acyclovir, Valaciclovir, Penciclovir and Famciclovir) 
or anti -cytomegalo viral nucleoside analogs  (such as  Ganciclovir or  Foscarnet) are prohibited 
unless required for the safety of the participant and the infection is not expected to be self -
limited without treatment. If used, these agents should only be used for the shortest possible 
duration.  When possible, the sponsor, Neurotech, should be consulted prior to initiating 
treatment. Anti -influenza neuraminidase inhibitors (such as Zanamivir, Oseltamyvir) or other 
anti-influenza medications (such as Arbidol, Amantadine, Rimantadine)  are permissible, if 
clinically indicated.  
6.[ADDRESS_517134], visual acuity examiner and photographers/imagers must remain masked to 
treatment assignment (NT -501 implant or sham procedure) for all visits. The Ophthalmologist, 
Surgeon and Clinic Coordinator will be unmasked to treatment assignment.  
To ensure that the refractionist, visual acuity examiner and photographers/imagers remain  
masked to the randomized assignment, the Ophthalmologist, Surgeon and Clinic Coordinator are not  to discuss the treatment received with the refractionist, visual acuity examiner and 
photographers/imagers.  
All personnel in the Central I mage Reading Center will be masked to whether the participant 
received the NT -501 implant or sham in a study eye(s) . 
Masking will remain as described above until all [ADDRESS_517135] 
completed their original NTMT -02 Protocol Month 24 visit  and data analysis has been 
completed . At that time, the Principal Investigators will be informed by [CONTACT_410045] 10,931  Page 10

7.1 Safety Plan 
A Safety Plan will describe roles and responsibilities, adverse event reporting methods and 
requirements, communication and interaction with the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), grading the severity of adverse events and other safety monitoring processes. The 
plan will be based on the safety reporting requirements for investigational new drug applications 
(INDs) found in 21 CFR part 312 and other applicable regulatory authorities’ regulations.  
7.2 Adverse Experience Reporting  
All adverse events (AEs) either observed by [CONTACT_410047]/her medical 
collaborators, or reported by [CONTACT_410048], will be reported. Any adverse event regardless of severity or potential association with the device or CNTF or study procedures must be documented in study records by [CONTACT_410049]. 
AEs will be reported within the participant’s records and in the AdvantageEDC
SM system. All 
AEs should be entered into the data system within [ADDRESS_517139] 
study visit.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until resolution or until stability is reached. In 
rare instances, this may include following the participant after completion of the study.  
All serious adverse events should be entered into the data system within 24 hours of 
identification. If the re are technical difficulties when entering the event into the EDC system, the 
IND 10,931  Page 13  
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.0 October 4, 2016 
SAE will be reported to the Coordinating Center  by [CONTACT_410050], and these numbers will 
be provided in the Manual of Operations. All information reported by [CONTACT_410051]. All SAEs should be reported to local Institutional Review 
Boards/Ethic Committees (IRBs/IEs) per local IRB/IEC requirements.  
7.[ADDRESS_517140] of a clinical trial. Any change 
in clinical status, routine labs, ophthalmological assessments etc., that is considered clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_410052] r or designee and requires intervention is considered an AE. 
Medical conditions or diseases present before a participant starts study treatment are only 
considered adverse events if they worsen after the participant starts study treatment (temporal associa tion).  
Suspected adverse reaction (Related Adverse Event)  is any adverse event for which there is 
a reasonable possibility that the treatment caused the adverse event. A reasonable possibility implies that there is evidence that the treatment caused the ev ent. 
Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) as determined by [CONTACT_410053]: 
1. Death 
2. Life-threatening AE (Life -threatening means that the study participant was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_352159], at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.)  
3. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
4. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
5. Congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
6. Important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes, but may 
jeopardize the health of the study participant or require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of  the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious event. 
Note that the term “serious” is not a measure of severity, but speaks to a very specific definition as noted in 1- 6 above.  
IND 10,931  Page 14  
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.[ADDRESS_517141] labeling (package insert) for the test article or the 
Investigator’s Brochure. This includes an increase in the frequency or severity of a previously reported adverse event that is significantly above the rates known from previous experience with the test article.  
Guidelines for Determining when Changes in Pre- Existing Conditions are Considered 
Adverse Events  
Adverse events include illnesses with onset during the study or exacerbations of pre- existing 
illnesses. Exacerbation of pre- existing illness is defined as a clinically relevant increase in the 
severity of the illness as compared to the start of the study and should be considered when a participant requires new or additional treatment for that illness. Investigators should use the 
following guidelines to assess when an adverse event needs to be reported for a condition which results in a change to an ongoing medication and/or addition of a new medication:  
• Addition of a new medication and/or  change in ongoing medication due to an untoward 
(unfavorable and unintended) change in a participant's medical health for a disease/condition documented as ongoing at baseline.  
• Addition of a new medication due to an untoward (unfavorable and unintended) change in a 
participant's medical health for a disease/condition not present at baseline.  
Guidelines for Assessing Intensity of an Adverse Event  
The Investigator should use the following definitions when assessing Intensity of an Adverse 
Event:  
• MILD: Transient (< 48 hours) or mild discomforts, no or minimal medical therapy or intervention required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266772], no or little limitation in normal activities.  
IND 10,931  Page 15  
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.0 October 4, 2016 
• MODERATE: Mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; 
possibly none but usually minimal intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].  
• SEVERE: Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410026].  
• LIFE THREATENING: Extreme limitation in activity, significant and immediate assistance 
required; significant medical/therapy intervention required to prevent loss of life; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency treatment or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328525].  
• FATAL: Death  
Guidelines for Determining Causality of an Adverse Event  
The Investigator will answer the following question when assessing causality of an adverse 
event to study treatment: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the treatment caused the event?” A reasonable possibility implies there is evidence that the specific event was caused by [CONTACT_104841] . An affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction, 
and the AE is therefore considered “related.” If the answer is no, then the AE is considered 
“unrelated.”  For every related adverse event, the Investigator will determine the causality in 
relation to the  surgical procedure - those  related to the device itself , and the CNTF.  
7.[ADDRESS_517142] be recorded. For participants who 
IND 10,931  Page 16  
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.[ADDRESS_517143] matching terminology describing the event as found in the “Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events” (CTCAE, v 4.0). If an available CTCAE term fits the event well, no additional descriptors 
may be needed. However, any necessary descriptions should be used in order to clarify the 
event or to place it in an appropriate context. If an appropriate term matching the adverse event 
cannot be found in the CTCAE, the adverse event description should include a diagnosis, sign 
or symptom with additional information to facilitate subsequent categorization into MedDRA coding terms. Each reported event will be a single term or concept.  
7.6 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an adverse event. A confirmed pregnancy in a 
participant (by [CONTACT_219492]) should be reported to the Coordinating Sponsor as soon as 
the Investigator has been made aware of the pregnancy. The decision on whether to remove 
the implant and terminate the participant from the study will be made by [CONTACT_410054].  The Investigator will use his/her expert 
judgment, based on an assessment of the potential benefit/risk to the participant, to determine if  
it is in the participant’s best interest to continue participation in the study.  
A pregnancy in the partner of a participant should also be reported to the Investigator who will in turn notify the Coordinating Center as soon as possible.  
The pregnancy should be followed until birth. The outcome of all such pregnancies  
(i.e., spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be documented and followed- up on a form that will be provided by [CONTACT_48876]. T he pregnancy will be followed to term and the outcome, including any premature 
termination, must be reported to the Coordinating Center. All live births must be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_517144] well -baby [CONTACT_765]. All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth 
defects and spontaneous abortions/miscarriages should be reported as an SAE for this study. 
IND 10,931  Page 17  
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.0 October 4, 2016 
Elective abortion procedures, without complications, should not be considered as adverse 
events.  
7.7 Notifying the Sponsor  
The Investigators will provide the Coordinating Center with data of all SAEs as defined per the protocol on an ongoing basis. The Coordinating Center’s Medical Monitor is responsible for notifying the Sponsor and will do so simultaneously with the reporting to the clinical database.  
As noted above, this should be within [ADDRESS_517145] be reported to 
FDA/regulatory authorities on an expedited basis. The final decision for disposition regarding 
reporting to the FDA/regulatory authorities rests with the Sponsor or their designee. The IND Sponsor or their designee is responsible for submitting the SAE reports to FDA/regulatory authorities. The Coordinating Center will provide the DSMC with any safety reports submitted to FDA/regulatory authorities. The Coordinating Center will maintain copi[INVESTIGATOR_410027]/regulatory  authorities by [CONTACT_1034].  
The Coordinating Center will provide these expedited reports to the individual site Investigators to submit to their respective IRB. Events that are serious, related to therapy and unexpected will be reported to FDA/regulatory authorities in 15 days or, for deaths and life threatening events,  in 
7 days (per 21 CFR 312.32).  
7.8 Notifying FDA / Regulatory Authorities and the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee  
After the SAE has been reported by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_410028], the IND Sponsor or their designee must report the event to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities using one of these two options:  
• Standard reporting (report in the annual report). This option applies if the AE is classified as one of the following:  
1. Serious, expected, suspected adverse reaction (serious, expected and related)  
2. Serious and not a suspected adverse reaction (serious and not related)  
• Expedited reporting is required. This option applies if the AE is classified serious and 
unexpected suspected adverse reaction (serious, unexpected and related).  
IND 10,931  Page 18  
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.[ADDRESS_517146] report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction (related AE) only if 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the test article and the adverse 
event, such as:  
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with 
test article.  
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with the test article 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the test article . 
• Aggregate analysis of specific serious adverse events observed in a clinical trial (such as 
known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other 
events that commonly occur in the study population independent of the test article therapy ) 
that indicates those events occur more frequently in the test article treatment group than in a 
concurrent or historical control group. 
• Any findings from clinical or epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], analysis of data pooled across multiple studies, published or unpublished scientific papers or from animal or in vitro testing that 
would result in a safety -related change in the protocol, informed consent, General 
Investigational Plan section of the IND or other aspects of the overall conduct of the trial.  
7.9 Reporting SAEs to the DSMC  
The Coordinating Center will provide the DSMC with safety reports submitted to FDA/regulatory 
authorities as well as data on all SAEs on an ongoing basis.  
The Investigator will ensure the timely dissemination of all AE information, including expedited reports and DSMC safe ty reviews, to the IRB and IEC in accordance with applicable local 
regulations and guidelines.  
7.[ADDRESS_517147] the withdrawal of a participant because of non- compliance (e.g., 
missed visits), administrative reasons or any other valid and ethical reasons.  
Reasons for participant discontinuation may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
IND 10,931  Page 19  
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.0 October 4, 2016 
• Investigator determination that it is not in the best interest of the participant to continue 
participation  
• Intercurrent illness  
• Adverse event  
• Worsening condition 
• Any other safety concerns  
If a participant withdraws or is discontinued from the study, they should return for an exit visit. 
The schedule of assessments for this visit is the same as that for the final visit . 
The Sponsor may terminate the study earlier than planned for any reason. In the event of early 
termination, the Sponsor will notify the Investigators and IRBs of the decision and will provide all relevant information.  
7.11 Safety Monitoring  
A medical monitor will be assigned to review safety information throughout the study. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will operate according to the DSMC Charter that will specify operations, roles and responsibilities and communication wit h 
the Sponsor.  
8 Statistical Considerations 
All analyses will be conducted separately for each Cohort. 
8.1 Efficacy  Outcomes 
Cohort 1  
Efficacy outcomes to investigate the efficacy of CNTF produced by [CONTACT_110586] -501 include (all changes 
relative to NTMT -01 baseline measurements):  
• Change in the ellipsoid zone (area of IS/OS loss) from baseline to Months 72, 84, 96 and 
108. 
• Change in retinal sensitivity (dB) as measured by [CONTACT_410038] 72, 84, 96 and 108.  
• Proportion of study eyes with a 35% or  more increase from baseline in the ellipsoid zone 
(area of IS/OS loss) at Months 72, 84, 96 and 108.  
• Change in BCVA from baseline to 72, 84, 96 and 108.  
IND 10,931  Page 20  
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.0 October 4, 2016 
• Proportion of study eyes with 15 or more letter loss from baseline in BCVA at 72, 84, 96 and 
108. 
• Prop ortion of study eyes with 10 or more letter loss from baseline in BCVA at 72, 84, 96 and 
108. 
Cohort 2  
The outcomes to investigate long term efficacy of CNTF or NT -501 include (all change relative 
to NTMT -02 baseline measurements):  
• Change in ellipsoid zone  (area of IS/OS loss) from baseline to Months 36, 48, 60 and 72.  
• Change in retinal sensitivity (dB) as measured by [CONTACT_410038] 
36, 48, 60 and 72 . 
• Proportion of study eyes with a 35% or more increase from baseline in the ellipsoid zone 
(area of IS/OS loss) at Months 36, 48, 60 and 72.  
• Change in BCVA from baseline to Months 36, 48, 60 and 72.  
• Proportion of study eyes with 15 or more letter loss from baseline in BCVA at Months 36, 48, 60 and 72.  
• Proportion of study eyes with 10 or more letter loss from baseline in BCVA at Months 36, 48, 60 and 72.  
• Change in reading speed from baseline to Months 36, 48, 60 and 72.  
8.2 Analys es in Support of the Efficacy Outcomes 
Cohort 1  
For continuous measures mean, median and distribution of change from baseline in BCVA, and enlargement of inner/outer segment discontinuity as measured by [CONTACT_66309]-OCT will be computed 
separately for study eyes and fellow eyes . For dichotomous outcomes proportions along with 
95% confidence intervals will be computed separately for study eyes and fellow eyes . 
Cohort 2  
Continuous efficacy measures will be assessed using mixed effects models with an overall Type I error rate of 0.05 (no adjustments of the type I error rate will be made). Due to clustered data 
(data from two eyes for a percentage of the participants), the variability associated with the 
estimates of effect (mean difference) from a fixed effects model is likely to be biased, leading to 
IND 10,931  Page 21  
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.[ADDRESS_517148] for the comparison of means between two treatment groups is not appropriate as it 
assumes that observations from the same cluster are independent. The appropriate statistical analysis of clustered data should take such correlation into consideration which can be accomplished for continuous outcome measures using a mixed effects model. The mixed effects model will incorporate both random (accounting for the correlation between eyes) and fixed effects (treatment) into the model and will be estimated with accompanying 95% confidence intervals and compared between treatment groups. For dichotomous outcomes , 
logistic regression incorporating the generalized estimation equation (GEE) methodology with 
accompanying 95% confidence intervals will be performed to determine if there are significant 
differences in the odds between the two treatment groups . 
The efficacy analyses will be repeated to investigate the strength of potential predictors using  multivariable mixed effects models or multiple logistic regression models. Examples of potential predictors  include the following: baseline visual acuity, clinical site, participant’s age at 
enrollment and gender.  
8.3 Sample Size  
A sample size of 66 participants, the number of participants enrolled in the NTMT -02 study and 
7, the number of participants enrolled in the NTMT -01 study , will be eligible for enrollment.  
8.4 Safety Analysis  
Long term s afety will be assessed through the summary of ocular and non-ocular adverse 
events, serious adverse events and pre- specified safety outcome as defined in Section 6. 1.3 
and will include frequency and descriptive tabulation. No formal statistical analysis will be 
employed. Safety analyses will include all participants who received the implant or sham.  
8.5  Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6764], high- level term and preferred term  separately 
for each Cohort. Summaries of adverse events by [CONTACT_410055]. Separate 
summaries will be prepared for non- ocular and ocular adverse events, with events in the study 
eye(s) and fellow eye summarized separately  for Cohort 1 and 2. Separate summaries of non -

MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.[ADDRESS_517149] the primary responsibility for assuring that the quality of the 
data collected and reported in the study are of consistently high quality. Many factors contribute to the quality of the data, from the design and procedures of the trial to the analytic methods employed. The Coordinating Center  works wi th the Reading Center on the design and 
implementation of a quality assurance program for grading images collected as part of the study.  
The major quality assurance features of the study are:  
• Standard data collection forms and procedures;  
• Common protocol f or eligibility, examination and follow -up of all participants in all clinical 
centers;  
• MASKED  assessment of the primary outcome measure and secondary outcome measures;  
• Central masked grading of study images;  
• Data entry into the study database and the Clinical Centers;  
• Central, computer driven data editing for missing, invalid and suspect responses;  
• Regular reporting of performance of all Clinical Centers;  
• Monitoring visits to all Clinical Centers; and  
• Certification of clinic staff and of imaging equipment.  
9 Human Participant Protection  
All participants will receive a verbal explanation from the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her appropriate designee in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures and 
potential risks of the study. In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_410029], the participants must be capable of comprehending the contents of the informed consent and able to sign an informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to enrollment . The participants 
will have an opportunity to review the consent form carefully and ask questions regarding this 
IND 10,931  Page 23  
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.0 October 4, 2016 
study prior to signing, and they will be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any 
time without prejudice to themselves.  
The participants’ names will not appear on any of the data forms reported to the Coordinating Center. Participants will be identified by a study number. The date of birth of each participant will be collected in the data system. The information collected will remain confidential.  
[ADDRESS_517150] procedures that are performed as part of a normal eye and medical exam. Some of the discomforts associated with the ocular exam include the following:  
1. Dilating drops or anesthetic drops may sting. They can cause an allergic reaction, or if contaminated, can cause an infection, but neither of these problems is very likely to occur.  
2. Dilating drops can also cause a sudden increase of pressure (acute glaucoma) in eyes that are already predisposed to develop this condition. There is little risk of glaucoma being triggered in this  way, but if it is, treatment is available.  
3. In rare instances, the cornea may be abraded during measurement of intra- ocular pressure 
or use of a contact [CONTACT_13293] (used for examination purpose only and not a contact [CONTACT_410056] a participants' refractive error).  
There are risks to the procedures required for participants in this  study.  
Optical Coherence Tomography is an FDA- approved imaging technique, which is not 
associated with any adverse events.  
Fundus photography and autofluorescence are not associated with any adverse events, 
although some participants may experience mild discomfort due to the bright lights.  
There are also risks associated with the operations performed during the NTMT -01 and NTMT -
02 surgical visit to implant the device and/or perform the sham procedure. These risks will 
remain in the extension protocol in case any new procedure related adverse experiences are recorded. In general, the risks of intraocular surgery are very small. Some side effects could 
occur locally in the eye and could affect the participant’s vision. There may be pain or infection, a small amount of bleeding, miosis, retinal detachment, cataract, vitritis and/or mild astigmatism.

In many cases, topi[INVESTIGATOR_410030]. More serious infection or inflammation may require further surgery on the eye, likely 
with removal of the implant. The sham procedure of subconjunctival injection of lidocaine and 
inserting a final suture in the conjunctiva may be accompanied by [CONTACT_410057], pain or infection which all can be readily treated without any functional changes or any other permanent structural changes.  
A possible complication of the explant surgery, if necessary,  to remove the NT- 501 device is a 
retinal detachment . The probability of retinal detachment in the normal population is less than 
1%. These other side effects are also possible (a probability of less than 1%):  
• Bleeding in the eye 
• Cataract  
• Infection 
• Inflamm ation inside the eye  
Surgery to remove the device may result in pain, loss of vision or blindness in rare cases . Some 
of these side effects can be treated with medication either by [CONTACT_410058]. Some side effects may require laser or surgery on the eye to treat.  
A small sample (about 0.1 mL) of the vitreous along with the device may be collected and 
shipped back to Neurotech for analysis.  
If the participants have the NT- 501 device removed, they will be invited to continue to part icipate 
in the Extension Study visits and assessments until the final Extension Study visit .

available for verification by [CONTACT_410061]. 
The Informed Consent Form should be revised whenever there are changes to the procedures 
outlined in the informed consent or  when new information becomes available that may affect the 
willingness of the participant to participate. Participants must be re- consented with the most 
current (updated) version of the respective Consent Form during their participation in the study if deemed required by [CONTACT_410062] . This consent process must be 
documented in the case history.  
11.[ADDRESS_517152] be submitted to the IRB/IEC by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_410031]. In addition, any participant recruitment materials must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_226809]/IEC annually or more frequently in accordance with the regulatory requirements and policies and procedures established by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC. Investigators are also responsible for 
promptly informing the IRB/IEC of any protocol changes or amendments and of any 
unanticipated problems involving risk to human participants or others.  
In addition to the requirements to report protocol -defined AEs to the Sponsor, Investigators are 
required to promptly report to their respective IRB/IEC all unanticipated problems involving risk to human participants . Some IRBs/IECs may want prompt notification of all SAEs, whereas 
others require notification only about events that are serious, assessed to be related to study

treatments and are unexpected. Investigators may receive written IDE safety reports or other 
safety -related communications from the Sponsor. Investigators are responsible for ensuring that 
such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements and with the policies and procedures established by [CONTACT_11577]/IEC  and archived in the site’s Study File.

study. In the event of an audit or inspection, the Principal Investigator (and institution) must 
agree to grant the monitor(s) and inspector(s) direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate their time and the time of their staff to discuss  any findings/relevant issues. The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_410032], Sponsor representatives, US FDA, other regulatory agencies, Institutional Review Boards and the respective national or local health authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.  
11.4 Electronic Case Report Forms  
Sites will receive training and a user’s guide appropriate for electronic case report form (eCRF) completion. The eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Coordinating Center and should 
be handled in accordance with instructions from the Coordinating Center.  
All eCRFs should be completed by [CONTACT_25755], trained examining personnel or the study coordinator as appropriate.  
In addition, at the end of the study, the Investigator will receive participant data for his or her site in a readable format that must be kept with the study records.  
11.5 Source Data Documentation  
Protocol monitors will perform ongoing site visits to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], complete and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents are where participant data are recorded and documented for the firs t time. 
They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, memoranda, evaluation checklists, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_410033] 10,931  Page 27  
MacTel NTMT -01/02E Version 2.0 October 4, 2016 
are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, photographic negatives, magnetic 
media and medico- technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
To facilitate monitoring, the Investigator(s) and institution(s) must provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and report s for trial -related monitoring, Sponsor audits 
and IRB/IEC review. The investigational site must also allow inspection by [CONTACT_112103].  
11.6 Use of Computerized Systems 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational  site’s computerized 
medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with FDA requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system (for clinical research purposes) would be one that (1) allows data entry only by [CONTACT_4539], (2) prevents the deletion or alteration of previously entered data and provides an audit trail for such data changes (e.g., modifications of file), (3) protects the 
database from tampering and (4) ensures data preservation.  
If a site’s computerized medical record system is not adequately validated for the purposes of clinical research (as opposed to general clinical practice), applicable hardcopy source 
documents must be maintained to ensure that critical protocol data entered into the eCRFs can 
be verified.

Protocol number:   HS130- 001 
Investigator and study center:   Rachel E. Sanborn, MD  
Providence Cancer Institute ,  
Portland, OR,  [LOCATION_003] 
Clinical phase:   Phase I  
Objectives:    
 
Primary : 
• To evaluate  safety and tolerability of HS -[ADDRESS_1194022] of Care (SOC)  
• To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)  of the combination HS -130 and HS-110 in patients 
with  solid tumors refractory to SOC  
 
Secondary:  
• To determine clinical response to combination treatment with HS -130 and HS- 110 
 
Exploratory : 
• To study the immunological effect generated by [CONTACT_156889]- 130 and HS-110 by  [CONTACT_857205] (NK) and T cell subsets for levels of activation, memory and exhaustion using flow cytometry  
• To evaluate patient archival tumor tissue for overexpressed Cancer Testis Antigens (CTAs) and shared 
antigen expression with HS -110 
• To evaluate immune reactivation response  to CTA  expressed in HS -110 (e.g. by [CONTACT_15236])   
• To determine the presence of a specific cytokine /chemokine  signature [CONTACT_857233] -130 and HS- 110, or any other unspecific inflammatory response  
• Genomic , immunohistochemical and p roteomic analyses of tumor tissue (pre -dose and on -treatment 
biopsy ) to identify biomarkers predictive of response or resistance to HS -110/HS -130, for example by 
[CONTACT_510646] ( mIHC)  
• Assess immunologically active dose based on flow cytometry analysis  of blood, using immune  marker 
panels of activation and suppression as defined in Section 8.6.1

HS-110 in patients with solid tumors  
 
HS130- 001 7 of 60 Version 2.0 -  11 Feb 2020  
Confidential - Entire Page  Study Overview :   
This is a n open -label, non- controlled,  first-in-human, Phase I study of the combined intradermal administration 
of HS-130 and HS-110 to patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to SOC.  
 
Escalating doses of the viable , replication -incompetent , human whole cell vaccines,  HS-130 and HS-110, will be 
administered to patients  via intradermal  injection s/re-injections  (up to 10 total)  on Day [ADDRESS_1194023] two treatment cycles, Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 ( 4 weeks ).  
 
Seven  dose levels will be explored , and patients will receive separate escalating doses of HS-130 and HS-110 in 
alternating fixed 1 :1 or 2 :1 ratio  based on the amount of secreted OX40L -Ig (HS-130) and gp96- Ig fusion protein  
(HS-110)  per cell of the drug product . The starting dose of HS -130/HS-[ADDRESS_1194024] 4 dose levels in  single patients .  There 
will be a staggered  enrollment with a minimum 1-week delay between each patient in cohort 1.  If any drug-
related ≥ Grade 2 (other than Grade 2 injection site reaction with pain) event occurs  during the first cycle of 
treatment, the study will revert to 3+[ADDRESS_1194025] 3+3  design.  Three 
patients will be enro lled in each subsequent dose cohort, and  enrolled with a (minimum) 1-week staggered  
delay  (i.e. Patient 2  to be d osed ≥1-week after  Patient [ADDRESS_1194026] dose , and Patient 3 to be dosed ≥1-
week after Patient [ADDRESS_1194027] dose) .   
 
In the 3- patient cohorts  (i.e. 3 patients treated at the same dose) , if [ADDRESS_1194028] two treatment cycle s, the dose cohort will be expanded up to 6 patients. If ≥ 2 out of 6 patients 
experience DLTs, the MTD has been exceeded, and dose escalation will cease. Up to 3 additional patients will 
be enrolled at a lower dose if only 3 patients were treated at that dose level, to confirm safety of that dose. 
MTD will be defi ned as a dose where ≤ [ADDRESS_1194029] 2 doses of HS -
130/HS- 110, the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment administered will be reviewed by [CONTACT_81443] (SRC). If 0 out of 3 patients or 1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT,  then the SRC may 
recommend enrollment at the next higher dose level.   
 
Any patient who does not receive two doses of the study treatment during the DLT window of observation (first 
2 cycles) , for reasons other than study drug -related toxicity  and did not experience a DLT will not be taken into 
account in the assessment of the overall DLT rate for the particular dose level cohort and will be replac ed. 
 
In the absence of progressive disease and intolerable toxicity after Cycle 2, the patient can continue the 
combination treatment of HS -130/HS -110 administered every  2-weeks  until disease progression, death, 
patient’s withdrawal of consent, I nvestigator decision to discontinue treatment , or intolerable toxicity, 
whichever occurs first.   
 Immune response may be a delayed effect, and in immuno- oncology , treatment beyond first progression is 
commonly used in situations  where clinical progression is asymptomatic and/or is not likely to result in life -
threatening complications with further progression. There fore, at the discretion of the I nvestigator the 
treatment with the therapeutic vaccines HS -130/HS -110 may continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_857187] a potential clinical benefit for the patient, and the following criteria are met:  
• No other approved palliative or curative salvage therapy exists for the indication (e.g. resection of 
pulmonary metastases in os teosarcoma patients).

• No DLT has been observed, and all toxicities resolved to the baseline level, consistent with the study 
eligibility criteria.  
• No deterioration of subject performance status.  
• Does not delay imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (e.g., 
CNS metastases).  
 
Visits and study examinations will be performed per the Schedule  of Assessments.  Safety will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_857206] -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs), evaluation of clinical laboratory parameters 
(hematology, and biochemistry), weight, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), performance status, physical 
exams (PEs), and recording of concurrent illness/therapy and a dverse events. CTCAE version 5 will be used to 
grade all toxicities.   
 
All patients will also be monitored for extensive safety assessment including serum cytokines/chemokines,  
immune reactivation response to HS -[ADDRESS_1194030] 1.11 with planned evaluation performed  every 8-week s ± 1-week.   
Number of patients:  13-30 patients will be enrolled in the study. Based on response observed in patients  
at different dose levels  and/or in patients with a particular tumor  type, the study protocol may be amended to 
allow for cohort expansion  of patients with specific characteristics.

Test product, dose and mode of administration:    
Each patient will be administered  separate  intradermal injection s (at the same injection sites)  of HS -130 (Lot 
HBI-HS-130-FP-001: OX40L -Ig concentration  = 338 ng OX40L -Ig/106 cells/24 -hr) and HS -110 (Lot [PHONE_17776]: 
gp96- Ig concentration  = 104 ng gp96 -Ig/106 cells/24 -hr) based on the dose levels as defined in the dose 
escalation scheme (Section 6.1.1 ) on Day 1 of each cycle .  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT):  
Adverse events will be assessed per CTCAE version 5.  Any toxicity that is at least possibly related to the study 
drug  may be considered as a DLT, which is defined  as non-acceptable (as defined below) treatment related 
toxicity (i.e., not attributable to the active disease, disease -related processes under investigation or intercurrent 
illness) observed during the first 4 weeks (or Cycle 1 a nd Cycle 2) of study treatment.  Ongo ing safety events 
beyond Cycle 2 will be reviewed across all cohorts during the study to help inform dose escalation decisions. 
Note, that all patients who enrolled in the study will be included in assessment of DLT.  
 
DLT is defined as non -acceptable toxicity which includes : 
1. Hematological toxicities ≥ Grade  3. 
2. Non -hematological toxicity ≥ Grade  3. 
3. Autoimmunity ≥ Grade 3  
4. Any other toxicity (greater than at baseline), considered clinically significant and/or unacceptable, and that 
does not respond to supportive care and results in a disruption of the dosing schedule of more than 14 
days.  
 
DLT excludes:  
1. Hematological and non -hematological ≤ Grade 2  unless considered non-acceptable . 
2. Grade 3 self -limited or medically controllable toxicities (e.g., fever without ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue).  
3. Electrolyte di sturbances that are managed to G rade 1 or less with supplemental therapy.  
 
A DLT will be considered related to HS -130/HS- 110 treatment unless there is a clear, well -documented, 
alternative explanation for the AE. AEs that meet the above criteria but  occur after the DLT window of 
observation  will not be defined as DLTs, but will be reported as AEs/Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), as applicable , 
and will be reviewed across all cohorts during the study to help inform dose escalation decisions.   
 
In case of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a DLT, the Investigator must inform the Medical Monitor/Sponsor immediately. The DLT 
will be confirmed by [CONTACT_171041] l Monitor/Sponsor and a decision must be taken by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor regarding  if an  
ad hoc  SRC meeting  is required.  
 
Patients who are tolerating HS -130/HS -[ADDRESS_1194037] to discontinue dosing prematurely due to the 
occurrence of DLTs in another patient in the same cohort, unless decided by [CONTACT_12217]. If requested by [CONTACT_3786], depending on the nature of the DLT and patient status, the SRC and the S ponso r may allow a 
patient to continue with study treatment at a reduced dose.  
Safety Review Committee (SRC)  
A Safety Review Committee  (SRC) comprised  of 3 members – one Investigator, a  representative from Heat 
Biologi cs and the Medical M onitor , will evaluate the data obtained at each dose level and will recommend 
whether the dose should be escalated as per protocol, revised to a lower level or intermediate level, halted 
altogether or more patients are required at the same dose level to evaluate safety.

 2.0 BACKGROUND INFORM ATION  
2.1 Introduction  
The dramatic clinical success of cancer immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_14953] a small percentage of patients has highlighted 
the need to identify combination approaches that increase the frequency of responders. Vaccination 
strategies using T cell costimul atory agents and/or blockade of immune inhibitory molecules (i.e. 
checkpoint inhibition) are being tested and developed as combination approaches in many ongoing 
clinical trials.  
 
Agonist antibodies targeting T cell costimulatory receptors such as [ADDRESS_1194044] activation3. 
This route of delivery for T cell costimulation is quite different than the physiological context in which the 
ligands for 4 -1BB, OX40, TNFRSF25, GITR and ICOS, are expressed, which is localized to individual tissue

presenting cells to express these ligands4,5,6. In addition to being localized to tissue microenv ironments, 
the kinetics of 4 -1BB ligand (L), OX40L, TL1A, GITRL and ICOSL expression demonstrate rapid induction 
and subsequent down -regulation within a [ADDRESS_1194045] for more than a few days –  a pattern 
that is not reproduced by [CONTACT_857208]. Recently, it has been shown 
that micro -injection of monoclonal  agonist antibodies into tumor lesions directly leads to anti-tumor 
benefits over systemic antibody administration, thus underscoring the benefit of employing localized co -
stimulation versus systemic costimulation7. 
 
Heat Biologics, Inc. has developed v iagenpumatucel -L, also known as HS -110, a novel allogeneic cellular 
immunotherapy designed to induce cell -mediated immunity for use in treatment of patients with 
refractory or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The active ingredients in viagenpumatucel -L 
are derived from a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, AD100, epi[INVESTIGATOR_857191]-A1 (the 
human histocompatibility surface antigen for identity) and gp96 -Ig (transgene constructed from 
sequences encoding the human gp96 gene), and a robust repertoire of NSCLC associated overexpressed 
cancer testis antigens  (CTAs) . The secreted fusion protein (gp96 -Ig) acts as a chaperone for these cancer 
antigens and an antigen presenting cell (APC) adjuvant  (TLR activation)  to induce CD8 biased cellular 
immune responses to these tumor antigens expressed by [CONTACT_84035]100 host cell. To date, over [ADDRESS_1194046] been treated with HS -110 with over 1000 doses of HS -110 
administered intradermally (IND No.  [ZIP_CODE]).  
 
To evaluate the additional therapeutic role of localized specific costimulation within the context of the 
HS-[ADDRESS_1194047] of OX40L co -stimulator in combin ation with HS -110, Heat Biologics has developed HS-
130, which  is a viable, replication-incompetent  (as final drug product)  cell line  genetically engineered from 
the same human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (AD100) as HS -110 but secreting OX40L-Ig fusion pr otein 
instead of gp96 -Ig and HLA -A1. In the initial trial to be conducted under this IND, Heat Biologics would like 
to evaluate the safety and optimal immunologic dose of HS-130 in  combination with HS-110 administered 
in a 1:1 or  2:1 ratio  based on expression of OX40L -Ig and gp96 -Ig (fg/24 -hr/cell)  respectively, in patients 
with solid tumors refractory to standard care.  
 Heat Biologics future development plan is to produce a combination therapy incorporating both T cell co -
stimulation (OX4 0L-Ig) and vaccination (gp96 -Ig) in one commercialized product using a single vector in a 
single cell line (AD100). After determining the optimal dose range  of co -administered HS -[ADDRESS_1194048] on a single vector/single cell line. The quantity of gp96 -Ig and OX40L -Ig fusion proteins secreted 
by [CONTACT_857209]-[ADDRESS_1194049] HS -130 is a viable whole cell vaccine , made  replication-incompetent by [CONTACT_54615],  
expressing the co -stimulatory fusion protein OX40L- Ig, which is the ligand for the OX40 receptor, a 
member of the TNF -receptor superfamily.   
 Similar to HS -110 (described below), HS -130 is derived from a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line 
established from a biopsy of a lung cancer patient and this cell line  is designated as AD100. AD100 is  
transfected with a 7192 bp plasmid cDNA ‘ pcDNA3.4 OX40L -Ig’ stably  expressing the cDNA for OX40L- Ig 
to develop an irradiated drug product, HS -130.  
 The plasmid vector map for pcDNA3.4 OX40L -Ig is presented below in Figure 1.

2.3 Preclinical Studies  
Key preclinical findings are summarized below.  Please refer to the current Investigator's Brochure for details of these and other studies.  
 2.3.1 Pharmacodynamics  studies  
In the pre -clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_857211], species specific (mouse) 
surrogate vaccines (mHS -130 and mHS -110 secreting OX40-Ig and gp96 -Ig respectively) were developed. 
Human HS -130 and HS -110 c ould not be administered to mice and vice versa due to their xenophilic nature 
leading to hyperacute xenograft rejection -mediated by [CONTACT_857212].
8,9,10 
Similarly, mHS -130/mHS -[ADDRESS_1194052] antibodies (OX40, ICOS and 4 -
1BB) when co -administered with mHS -110, OX40 agonist antibody showed the best synergy in promoting 
CD8+ T cell expansion, without the inducti on of CD4+ FoxP 3+ T regulatory cell populations (Tregs). 
Comparatively,  the addition of an ICOS agonist antibody did not increase CD8+ T cell expansion over mHS -
[ADDRESS_1194053] and to measure the efficacy of the gp96-Ig combination cellular vaccines, a cohort of mice was  
administere d the combination vaccine mHS -130/mHS -110 and their immune response was recorded. The 
CD8+ T cell mediated immune response, via local OX40L -Ig expression, appeared to be superior to other 
fusion proteins (ICOSL -Ig, 4 -1BBL -Ig) generating significant increases in both primary and boost immune 
responses evidenced by [CONTACT_857213] -specific CD8+ T cells.  
 
In a preclinical study11,12 to evaluate the memory and antigen specific  response of mHS -130/mHS -110 
combination vaccine, the combination vaccine resulted in superior activation and expansion of antigen -
specific CD8+ and memory T cell subsets, along with antigen -specific CD8+ cytotoxic and CD4+ helper T  
cell responses without triggering a systemic induction of proinflammatory cytokines, which were associated with OX40 agonist antibody treatment.  
 
The antitumor effect of mHS -130/mHS -110 was also studied in two preclinical mouse tumor models; B16 -
F10-melanoma and CT26 -colon carci noma. In both models mHS -110/mHS -130 generated potent antigen -
specific T  cell expansion and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) counts were associated with delays in 
tumor growth
11,12.  This study repeated earlier findings that combination vaccination with mHS -130 
(OX40L-Ig)  and mHS-110 (gp96-I g) could lead to increased frequency of complete tumor rejection, while 
concomitantly providing a potent memory response without increases in Treg numbers.  
 
2.3.2 Immuno -toxicity Studies  
Up until April 2019, over  100 patients with non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been treated,  and over  
1000 doses  (up to 10 million cells /dose ) of the HS- [ADDRESS_1194054] been administered (IND 
[ZIP_CODE]) , without any overt toxicity.  
 No formal GLP toxicology studies for HS -[ADDRESS_1194055] been  proposed or  conducted  to date . Since HS-130 and 
HS-110 are s pecies (human) -specific, viable, replication-incompetent  whole cell vaccines , that are 
administered intradermally, experimental experience suggests that safety pharmacology and toxicology studies with  HS-[ADDRESS_1194056] similar effects in humans due to 
their nature as xenogeneic cellular entities. The mechanism for hyperacute xenograft rejection of 
discordant cellular entities (e.g., HS -130 in a mouse model) has been well characterized, involving 
responses from both innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.

pharmacology  and toxicology  of HS-130.   
 
Based on the results from an  in-vitro  experiment15 to compare the signaling strength of mouse, monkey 
and human OX40L -Ig in a human OX40 receptor signaling assay, the potency of OX40L from different 
species was found to be comparable in its magnitude to activate the human OX40 receptor in the Jurkat/OX40 cell based signaling system. It was observed that monkey (rhesus or cynomolgus) OX40L 
ligand is similar to human  as well as compared to mouse OX40L in the human OX40 receptor assay.  This 
suggests that all three species are compatible and share similar aff inity for each receptor allowing for 
preclinical translation of mouse model results to human.   
 
To study the mechanism of action of cancer vaccines, an intact and syngeneic immune system is required. 
There are no validated cancer cell line models for  in vivo  experiments in monkeys  and the n on-human 
primate tumor models are not validated or well characterized. Therefore, mouse surrogate cell lines  in 
murine animal models  were utilized to demonstrate in vivo  proof -of-concept for activity  and to study the 
toxicokinetics in order to estimate a safe clinical starting dose of HS-130 and HS -110.  
 
To establish the acute effects in terms of cytokine and chemokine release, a non -GLP study
16 was 
conducted in mice to establish the differences betwe en xenogeneic (HS -130) vs. same species (mHS -130)  
vs. a mouse OX40 agonist an tibody . Five single escalating doses of HS-130, mHS- 130, and an agonist OX40 
antibody were administered to mice  to determine a cell number threshold of  HS-130, that can induce a 
robust xenogeneic rejection response in mice,  as measured by [CONTACT_857214].  Significant 
responses were seen for the cytokines: IL -17A, ICL10, MCP-3/CCL7, MIP -1-beta/CCL4, TNF -alpha, Gro-
alpha/KC/CXCL1, which could be partially attributed to an anti -human, xenotransplantation response  
and/or related to the expected innate immune response to foreign cellular matter, required to remove 
foreign protein particles . Significant response was  only observed for the highest cellular dose t ested. The 
No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was determined to be 400 μg (20 mg/kg) for agonist OX40 
antibody, 219.5 ng/24-hr per animal (0.0109 mg/kg) and 387.2 ng/24-hr per animal (0.0193 mg/kg)  for 
HS-[ADDRESS_1194058] level (MABEL ) for dose 
combinations of mHS -130 (OX40L-Ig) and mHS -110 (gp96-Ig) in mice was determined using anti -tumor 
CD8+ T  cell expansion and tumor growth inhibition as a  measure of vaccine efficacy
17.   
 Mice were injected with three different dose ratios of mHS-130 to mHS -110, based on the secretion of 
OX40L-Ig to gp96 -Ig (1.3:1, 2.5:1 and 5:1), in a dose -escalating manner. Based on this study, a ratio of 1.[ADDRESS_1194059] expansion of anti -tumor CD8+ T cells, with the 
optimal expansion found to be 441 ng/24-hr of OX40L-Ig combined with 339 ng/24-hr of gp96-Ig. This 
dose and ratio combination also resulted in a higher proportion of activated, endogenous CD8+ T cells, 
marked as CD44
hi, and an increase in the percentage of short -lived effector cells (SLECs), which are 
responsible for early tumor cell killing. This dose combination also resulted in highly significant (p<0.001) 
tumor gro wth inhibition which accompanied an increase in CD4+ and CD8+ TIL accumulation in the tumor. 
The lowest dose combination provided a No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) of 50 ng/24-hr of OX40L-Ig to

7 viable cells /0.5 mL ,

 2.[ADDRESS_1194062] been rendered replication-incompetent via irradiation. 
While the tolerability and safety to HS- 110 is relatively well known (IND No. [ZIP_CODE]), HS -130 has previously 
not been a dministered to humans and cannot be reliably studied in rodents due to hyperacute xenograft 
rejection . The starting dose rationale for this current study is based on the clinical experience for HS-110 
and derived from non -clinical studies in mice using syngeneic cell lines as surrogates for HS -130 (mHS -
130) and HS -110 (mHS -110) to calculate a MABEL. The use of MABEL is considered appropriate since the 
immunological (pharmacodynamic) response (CD8+ T cell clone and total CD8+ population) takes time to develo p and is not related to plasma concentrations.   
 Based on the experimental outcome of the study conducted to determine CD8+ T cell expansion in mice 
when administered variable ratios of mHS-[ADDRESS_1194063] was detected in a CD8+ T cell clone at an absolute dose 
of 50 ng /24- hr of OX40-Ig (mHS -130) to 38 ng /24-hr of gp96-Ig (mHS -110) at a 1.3 to  1 dose ratio 
respectively, compared to 38 ng /24-hr  of gp96 -Ig (mHS -110) alone (a dose without any measurable 
effect). For sub-populations of CD8+ T cells (KLRG1
hi, CD127lo and CD44hi, short lived effector cells, SLEC), 
a significant increase was not detected until an absolute dose of 441 ng/24-hr of OX40L-Ig to 339 ng /24-
hr of gp96 -Ig at a 1.3:1 dose ratio.  This also correlated with tumor growth inhibition and increased TIL 
numbers in tumors.   
 
Thus, our suggested starti ng dose in patients is 150 ng/24-hr  of HS-130 to 150 ng/24-hr  of HS-110  (1:1 
ratio ) administered  every 2 -weeks . This dos e:  
• Represents the MABEL dose  in mice for a specific clone of CD8+ T cells and the expansion of 
peripheral CD8+T cell populations (SELC and CD44 activated)  using mHS -[ADDRESS_1194064] surrogates . No adjustments for weight or BSA are  suggested, which gives a safety factor 
to the huma n dose of > 100-fold.  
• Represents less than 1/10th of the safe and effective current clinical dose for HS- 110 (IND [ZIP_CODE]).  
At the highest suggested dose in this study, HS -110 is given at approximately 0.8 of the 
documented HS -110 dose currently administere d in patients.

130 is available.  
 
All currently available clinical data for HS -110 (viagenpumatucel -L) suggest that this allogeneic cell therapy 
is safe and well tolerated in adults with NSCLC. Mild to moderate injection site reactions, especially 
induration, erythema, pruritus, pain and rash are expected  as they indicate the vaccine has an 
immunogenic effect, but these have been well-tolerated. No significant safety concerns or risks associated 
with this allogeneic cell therapy have been reported.  
 To date, no clinically signific ant toxicities deemed by [CONTACT_857215], probably or definitely

• To determine the presence of a specific cyto kine/chemokine signature [CONTACT_857233] -130 and HS -110, or any other unspecific inflammatory response  
• Genomic , immunohistochemical  and proteomic analyses of tumor tissue (pre- dose and on -treatment 
biopsy) to identify biomarker s predictive of response or resistance to HS-110/HS -130, for example by 
[CONTACT_510646] (mIHC)  
• Assess immunologically active dose based on flow cytometry analysis  of blood, using immune marker 
panels of activation and suppression as defined in section 8.6.[ADDRESS_1194068] -in-human, Phase I study of combined  intradermal 
administration of HS -130 and HS -110 to patients with advance d solid tumors refractory to SOC.  
 
Escalating doses of the viable, replication-incompetent, human whole cell vaccines, HS-130 and HS -110 
will be administered to patients via  intradermal injections /reinjections  (up to 10 total ) on Day [ADDRESS_1194069] two treatment cycles, Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 ( 4 weeks ).  
 
Seven dose levels will be explored, and patients will receive separate escala ting doses of HS-130 and  HS-
110 in alternating fixed 1:1 or 2:1 ratios based on the amount of secreted OX40L -Ig (HS -130) and gp96- Ig 
fusion protein (HS -110) per cell of the drug product (Section 6.1.1). The starting dose of HS -130/HS -110 
combination is based on the dose-ranging studies conducted in animal model s of T cell expansion and 
tumor challenge, as well as established clinical experience from HS-110.  
 
In the absence of progressive disease and intolerable toxicity after Cycle 2, the patient can continue the 
combination treatment of HS-130/HS-110 administered every 2 -weeks  until  disease progression, death, 
patient ’s withdrawal of consent, I nvesti gator decision to discontinue treatment , or intolerable toxicity, 
whichever occurs first.   
 
Immune response may be  a delayed effect, and in immuno -oncology, treatment beyond first progression 
is commonly used in situations where clinical progression is as ymptomatic and/or is not likely to result in 
life-threatening complications with further progression. Therefore, at the discretion of the I nvestigator 
the treatment with the therapeutic vaccines HS-130/HS -110 may continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_857193] , if the investigator considers this of a potential clinical benefit for the patient,  and the 
following criteria are met:  
• No other approved palliative or curative salvage therapy exists for the indication (e.g. resection of pulmonary metastases in osteosarcoma patients).  
• The patient continues to meet all other study protocol eligibility criteria.  
• No dose limiting toxicity (DLT) has been observed, and all toxicities resolved to the baseline level, consistent with the study eligibility c riteria.  
• No deterioration of subject performance status.  
• Does not delay imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression 
(e.g., CNS metastases).  
 
13-30 patients will be enrolled i n the study. Based on response observed in patients at different dose 
levels and/or in patients with a particular tumor type, the study protocol may be amended to allow for 
cohort expansion of patients with specific characteristics.

reduction of HS -110 and HS -130 (dose level -1).  
 
Once all patients in a cohort have completed the first two cycles of dosing and received at least 2 doses 
of HS-130/HS -110, the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment administered will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_857220] (SRC). If 0 out of 3 patients or 1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT,  then 
the SRC may recommend enrollment at the next higher dose level.   
 
Any patient who does not receive two doses of the study treatment during the DLT window of observation 
(first 2 cycles /4 weeks ), for reasons other than study drug-related toxicity and did not experience a DLT 
will not be taken into account in the a ssessment of the overall DLT rate for the particular dose level cohort 
and will be replaced.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_1194097] possibly related to the study drug may be considered as a DLT, which is defined as non -acceptable (as defined below) treatment 
related toxicity (i.e., not attributable to the active disease, disease -related processes under investigation 
or intercurrent illness) observed during the first 4 weeks (or Cycle 1 and Cycle 2) of study treatment.  
Ongoing safety events beyond Cycle 2 will be reviewed across all cohorts during the study to help inform dose escalation decisions. Note, that all patients who enrolled in the study  will b e included in assessme nt 
of DLT . 
 
DLT is defined as non -acceptable toxicity which  includes:  
1. Hematological toxicities ≥ Grade 3. 
2. Non -hematological toxicity ≥ Grade  3. 
3. Autoimmunity ≥ Grade 3  
4. Any other toxicity (greater than at baseline), considered clinically significant and/or unacceptable, and 
that does not respond to supportive care and results in a disruption of the dosing schedule of more than 14 days.  
 
DLT excludes: 
1. Hematological and no n-hematological ≤ Grade 2 unless considered non -acceptable.  
2. Grade 3 self -limited or medically controllable toxicities (e.g., fever without ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue).  
3. Electrolyte disturbances that are managed to Grade 1 or less with supplemental therapy.  
 
A DLT will be considered related to HS- 130/HS -110 treatment unless there is a clear, well-documented, 
alternative explanation for the AE. AEs that meet the above criteria, but occur after the DLT window of 
observation  will not be defined as DLTs, but will be reported as AEs/Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), as 
applicable, and will be reviewed across all cohorts during the study to help inform dose escalation 
decisions.  
 
In case of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a DLT, the Investigator must info rm the Medical Monitor/Sponsor immediately. The

a patient  to continue with study treatment at a reduced dose.  
 
6.1.3 Maximum Tolerated Dose  (MTD)  and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2 D) 
The definition of MTD will be based upon review of safety data and DLTs corresponding to the first two cycle s of therapy in at least [ADDRESS_1194099] DLTs. The RP2 D may be equivalent to MTD  OR the maximum feasible dose. The dose that  is 
selected after this study for phase 2 evaluation may also  be an immunologically active dose ( assessed 
based on flow cytometry analysis of blood, using immune marker panels of activation and suppression as 
defined in Section   8.6.1 ). 
 
6.2 Dose  Interruptions /Withholding  
Study drug may be withheld from a patient based on the Investigator‘ s decision in the event of 
intercurrent illness, adverse event, administrative reasons, or other reasons. If the patient‘s condition 
subsequently improves, or the situation that resulted in withholding study drug rectifies itself, the 
Investigator may resu me dosing as soon as possible, unless the delay is more than 2 -weeks. Doses should 
not be skipped.  
 Dosing  should  be delayed for any DLT -equivalent toxicity and possible >Grade 2 adverse events  considered 
related to study medicati on. At the I nvestigator’s discretion, dosing may recommence when the toxicity 
has resolved to G rade 2 or less. Immune related reactions or allergy should resolve t o Grade 1 or less.  
 Treatment will be  discontinued if the next cycle cannot be initiated if a TEAE has not resolved (to  
acceptable grade) after ≤2 weeks.  
 
Patients who miss a dose during Cycle 1  and Cycle 2  may be replaced in the study  per Section 5.4.2 . The 
interrup tion and/or missed dose(s) should be recorded.  
 
6.3 Dose Modification

k:  Pre -treatment biopsy (archival tissue may be submitted if collected le ss than [ADDRESS_1194103] confirms that an adequate amount of 
tissue/tumor cells exist to allow completion of all testing as outlined in the Specimen Collection Manual) and on -treatment biopsy collected within 5 -14 days after  
patient completes 2nd dose of HS -130/HS -110 for genomic and proteomic analysis of exploratory biomarkers (e.g. mIHC). Biopsy should be collected for patients with 
accessible tumor lesions, incl. metastases (e.g. lymph node metastases) where it is consider ed feasible without a risk of complications for the patient. Coagulation 
parameters and blood cells should be assessed and reviewed per institutional standard prior to any biopsy.  
l:   HS-130 and HS -110 will be administered via intradermal injections/re -injections  (up to 10 total) on Day 1 of each cycle , depending on the assigned dose level . (See 
section 6.1 Drug preparation and administration)  
m: All assessments should be performed at 30 days ± [ADDRESS_1194104] treatment, during the 30 -day safety follow -up visit.

8.1 Safety Assessments  
8.1.1 Safety Analysis  
Safety data will be tabulated for all patients and include vital signs, laboratory parameters, and adverse 
events.  
 
8.1.2 Reporting of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untow ard medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a l aboratory finding), 
symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether 
or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
 
The AE reporting period starts on Cycle 1 Day 1; if an AE occurs before  the first dose of study treatment it 
will be  captured as baseline and considered  a part of the medical history ; however, if the AE is directly 
attributed to a study procedure prior to C1D1, it may be reported as an AE   At each evaluation , patients 
should be interviewed in a non-directed manner to elicit potential adverse reactions from the patient.  
The occurrence of an adverse event will be based on changes in the patient’s physical examination, 
laboratory results, and/or signs and symptoms.  
 
All adverse events (except G rade 1 and 2 laboratory abnormalities that do not require an intervention), 
regardless of causal relationship, are to be recorded in the case report form and source documentation.  The Investigator must determine the intensity of any advers e events according to the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5 .0 (APPENDIX II) and their causal relationship. 
Those AEs not covered by [CONTACT_550636]:  
 
1. Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity. Prescription drug  not 
ordinarily needed for relief of symptom but may be given because of personality of patient.  
 
2. Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity. Patient is able to continue in study; treatment for symptom may be needed.  
 
3. Severe: Incapacitating, severe discomfort with inability to work or to perform normal daily 
activity. Severity may cause cessation of treatment with test drug; treatment for symptom may 
be given and/or patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
 
4. Life-Threatening: Symptom(s) place the patient at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious from, might have 
caused death. 
 
5.  Fatal: Event caused the death of the pati ent.

HS130- 001 42 of 60 Version 2.0 -  11 Feb 2020  
Confidential - Entire Page  Adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization while the patient remains on-study.  Once 
the patient is removed from study, events thought to be related to the study medication will be followed 
until resolution or stabilization, unless, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_857198]’s underlying disease, or until the patient starts a new treatment regimen or the patient is lost 
to follow -up. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Attribution Definitions  
An adverse event is considered to be associated with the use of the Investigational Product  if the 
attribution is determined as possible or  definite. Attribution of AEs will be recorded in the CRF as: 
 
• Unrelated: The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
• Possible: The AE may  be related to the study treatment.  
• Definite: The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of an Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected adverse event is defined as any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of 
which is not co nsistent with the current Investigator Brochure; or, if an Investigator Brochure is not 
required or available, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the risk information 
described in this protocol or in the regulatory agency study aut horization application.   
 
Unexpected, as used in this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously 
observed (e.g., included in the Investigator Brochure) rather than from the perspective of such experience 
not being antici pated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
1. Results in death,  
2. Is life -threatening (i.e., the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer 
to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe),  
3. Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_857199], disease staging/re -staging procedures, or catheter placement unless 
associated with other serious events,  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events t hat may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_857200], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.

HS130- 001 43 of 60 Version 2.0 -  11 Feb 2020  
Confidential - Entire Page  Disease Progression, or death as a result of disease progression, are not considered to be SAEs . However, 
if the progression of the underlying disease is greater than what would normally be expected as part of 
the natural course of the disease under study for the patient, or if the Investigator considers that there 
was a causal relationship between treatment with study drug or protocol design/procedures and the 
disease progression, then it must be reported as  an SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reference Safety Information  
The Reference Safety Information (RSI), in the current, approved Investigator's Brochure, is a list of 
expected Serious Adverse Reactions which are classified using Preferred Terms (PTs) according to the 
Medical Dicti onary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The RSI section will be used for assessing the 
expectedness of the study medication.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy detected during the study, or that occurs within [ADDRESS_1194111] becomes aware of a 
pregnancy or its ou tcome. This will be performed by [CONTACT_550637] , 
or its designee.   
 
Any pregnancy complication, spontaneous abortion, elective termination of a pregnancy for medical 
reasons, outcome of stillbirth, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or serious adverse event in the mother 
will be recorded as an SAE and will be reported as des cribed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events classified as serious require expeditious handling and reporting to Sponsor’s monitoring CRO  to comply  with regulatory requirements. In general, reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will 
begin at the time of first dosing on Cycle Day 1 ; however, SAEs occurring prior to first dosing may be 
reported if directly attributable to a study procedure.  
 
For any serious adverse event (SAE) that occurs while a patient is on-study; within [ADDRESS_1194112] study 
drug administration, regardless of  any opi[INVESTIGATOR_122950]; or if any 
SAE that the Investigator feels is related to the study drug occurs later than [ADDRESS_1194113] study 
drug administration, the Sponsor  or it’s designee  must be notified immed iately ( within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event ).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Data Review  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Safety Review Committee  
A Safety Review Committee (SRC ) comprises  of 3 members –  one Investigator , a representative from Heat 
Biologics and the Medical Monitor will evaluate the data obtained at each dose level including  a review 
of all adverse events (serious and non -serious adverse events) as they are reported by [CONTACT_3452]. The 
SRC will recomme nd whether the dose should be escalated as per protocol, revised to a lower level or 
Heat Biologics  
Protocol No.  HS130 -[ADDRESS_1194114] 50% reduction of HS -130 an d HS-110 (dose level -1), depending 
on the nature of the reaction . 
 
Ad-hoc SRC meetings may be  called for by [CONTACT_857224] e study if DLTs are 
observed and/or new safety data warrants immediate action to the conduct of the trial  (including events 
defined by [CONTACT_857225][INVESTIGATOR_857201] 5.5). 
 
The conclusion of the SRC  meeting will be documented in meeting minutes. The outcome of  the SRC 
meeting will be communicated to all Investigators.  
 8.2 Efficacy Assessments  
Patient ’s disease st atus will be monitored by [CONTACT_857226] (CT scans or MRI) as per 
RECIST 1.1
1 criteria  (Section 8.2.1 ). Patient response per RECIST 1.11 will be evaluated as complete 
response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease . 
 
For the purpose of this study, patients will be evaluated after  every 8 -weeks  ± 1-week  from C1D1.  In the 
event objective response (PR or CR) is noted, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_118116] [ADDRESS_1194115] met. For stable disease (SD), follow -up measurements must meet the SD criteria at least [ADDRESS_1194116] 1.1
1; therefore , at the I nvestigator’s discretion patients may continue to receive the HS-130/HS -
[ADDRESS_1194117] 1.1 Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria (version 1.1) 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee1. Changes in only the 
largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST 1.11 criteria. 
Note:  Lesions are either measurable or non-measurable using the criteria provided below. The term 
“evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning 
or accuracy.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Measurable Disease  
Measurable disease is de fined by [CONTACT_12155]. Measurable lesions are 
defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension [longest diameter ( LD) in the 
plane of measurement to be recorded] with a minimum size of:  
• [ADDRESS_1194118] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with 
calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)  
• [ADDRESS_1194119] x -ray

Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must 
be ≥ [ADDRESS_1194120] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5  mm).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable Disease 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥  10 to < 15 mm short axis) are considered non -measurable disease. Lesions considered 
truly non -measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmoni s, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by 
[CONTACT_857227].  
 Bone lesions, cystic lesions and lesions previously treated with local therapy must be considered as 
follows:  
 
Bone lesions: 
• Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to measure 
bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic  lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_47333] (i.e., CT or MRI) can be considered as 
measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described 
above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable. 
 Cystic lesions: 
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple 
cysts.  
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if non -cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 Lesions with prior local treatment:  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco -
regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Target Lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in total, representative 
of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions shou ld be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their 
suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the 
diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal  lesions) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218].

HS130- 001 46 of 60 Version 2.0 -  11 Feb 2020  
Confidential - Entire Page  [IP_ADDRESS] Lymph Node Assessment  
For lymph nodes, measurements  should be made of the short axis, which is defined as perpendicular to 
the LD of node assessed in the plane of measurement:  
• Target lesion if short axis ≥ 15 mm  
• Non -target lesion if short axis is ≥  10 but < 15 mm  
• Normal if short axis < 10 mm 
For baseline, add the actual short axis measurement to the sum of LD of non -nodal lesions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present,”  “absent,” or in rare cases “unequivocal progression.”  In 
addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on 
the case report form (e.g., ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver met astases’).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more 
than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
 Target lesions located in a previously irradiated areas should if possible be avoided, but such lesions may 
be designated as target lesions if clearly progressing (by [CONTACT_393] 1.1
1 definition) at the latest evaluation 
prior to screening.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified 
and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation is preferred to evaluation 
by [CONTACT_30574] a treatment.  
 
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be  considered measurable when they are superficial and  ≥ 10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. W hen lesions can be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_51752], imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more 
objective and may be reviewed at the end of the study.  
 Chest x -ray.  Chest CT is preferred over chest x -ray, particularly when progress ion is an important 
endpoint. Lesions on chest x-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded 
by [CONTACT_6776].   
 
Conventional CT and MRI.   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the 
assumptio n that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1194121] slice thickness > 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is acceptable in certain

[IP_ADDRESS] Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  
 Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have red uction in short axis to <  10 
mm.  
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolut e increase of at least 5  mm. The 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
 
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1194123] the actual short axis measurement recorded 
(measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline exam), even if the nodes regress to bel ow [ADDRESS_1194124] achieve a short axis < 10 mm.  For PR, SD and PD, the 
actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Target Lesions that Become “too small to measure ” 
All lesions (nodal and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded 
at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_857202], the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed 
to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned.

HS130- 001 48 of 60 Version 2.0 -  11 Feb 2020  
Confidential - Entire Page  [IP_ADDRESS].5  Evaluation of Non-target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological  in size 
(< 10 mm short axis).  
 
Non -CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal li mits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. (The 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.) 
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non -target 
disease, there must be  an overall level of substantial worsening in non -
target disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation.  
[IP_ADDRESS].6  New Lesions  
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e., not attributed to differences in scanning technique, 
change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor, such as a ‘new’ 
healing bone lesion). A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomica l location that was not 
scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  If a new lesion is equivocal, continued therapy and follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If 
repeat scans confir m this is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progressio n/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started). The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on findings of 
both target and non -target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions. 
Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study, it may also require confirmatory measurement. 
Specifically, in non-randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR or CR is 
needed to deem either one the “best overall response.”   
 
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified time point,  a response assessment occurs ( Table 4) provides 
a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have measurable 
disease at baseline.  When patient s have non -measurable disease, ( Table 5) should be used.

* If CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after 
CR).  Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met.  However, sometimes ‘CR’ 
may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in the fact patient 
had PR, not CR, at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR 
and the best response is PR.

without  a prior  reported  progression  will be censored  at the last evaluable  tumor assessment  prior to the  
initiation of  the subsequent  anticancer therapy.  
 8.6 Analysis of Immune Response  
Approximately 23 mL of blood will be collected  on Day 1 ( prior to administration of HS130/HS110) and 
Day [ADDRESS_1194131]  
Immune-phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_794402]’s peripheral b lood sample will be performed  by [CONTACT_4133] , which 
may include but is not limited to  surface  and intracellular  markers  that define naïve T cells (CD4 and CD8), 
central memory T cells (CD4 and CD8), effector T cells (CD4 and CD8) , memory T cells (CD4 and CD8),  
senescent T cells (cytotoxic and helper ), terminal differentiated senescent T cells ( cytotoxic and helper), 
natural killer ( NK) cells, natural ki ller T cells ( NKT) , T regulatory cells, proliferative T regulatory cells, 
activated T cells (helper and cytotoxic), proliferative T cells (helper and cytotoxic), T cell markers of 
exhaustion (helper and cytotoxic; CTLA -4, PD -1, TIGIT, TIM3).  
 
Immune pheno type profiling to determine  proportions of NK and T cell subsets for levels of activation, 
memory and exhaustion will be performed from blood samples collected on  Day 1 ( prior to administration 
of HS130/HS110)  and Day 8 for  Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 , and at 30-day safety follow-up visit . The goal of this 
analysis will be to establish an immunologically active clinical dose for the combination of HS-130 and HS -
110.  
 
8.6.2 Immune Reactivation Response  
Immune reactivation response to CTA expressed in HS -110 will be e valuated by [CONTACT_857228] -
induced secretion of cytokines IFNγ, granzyme B (gzB) from patients PBMCs via ELISPOT from blood 
samples collected Day 1 ( pre-dose)  and Day 8 for Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 and at 30 -day safety follow-up visit . 
Number of cells resp onding over the course of treatment after subtraction of appropriate patient controls 
will be calculated.  
 
8.7 Analysis of Pro -inflammatory Cytokines  and Chemokines  
Approximately 3 mL of b lood samples will be collected at the following time-points during Day 1 of C ycle 
1 and C ycle 2 for determination of serum cytokines  and chemokines using an extensive panel of markers  
that may include but is not limited to, G -CSF, GM -CSF, IFN -gamma, IFN-alpha, IL -1alpha, IL -1beta, IL -2, IL -
3, IL-4, IL -5, IL-6, IL -7, IL -8, IL-9, IL -10, IL -12p40, IL-13, IL-15/15R, IL -17A, IL-18, IL -22, IL-23, IL- 27, IL-28, IL-

RANTES/CCL5, TNFalpha, ENA78/CXCL5, and Eotaxin -1/CCL11 .        
• Day 1: Prior to administration of HS130/HS110  
• Day 1: 2hr ± 10 minutes after completion of HS130/HS110 treatment  
 
For Cycle 3 and beyond cytokine/chemokine testing will only be performed if the patient is symptomatic (i.e. flu-like symptoms, fever, or allergic reactions) .  
 8.8 Bioinformatics Analysis of CTAs and Shared Antigen Expression  
Archival tissue  from patients  will be sent for bioinformatics  analysis (e.g. RNA sequencing)  of 
overexpressed CTAs and to study shared antigen expression with HS -110.  
 
8.9 Exploratory Biomarkers  
Biopsy samples will be collected from patients during screening/baseline and within [ADDRESS_1194132] completed second dose of  treatment with the HS- 130/HS -[ADDRESS_1194133].  
Archival tissue may be substituted for fresh biopsy during screening/baseline,  if collecte d less than [ADDRESS_1194134] confirms that an adequate amount of tissue/tumor 
cells exist to allow completion of all testing as outlined in the Tumor Biopsy  Collection Manual .  
 
Biopsies should only be collected from lesions considered safely accessible, either image -guided or 
palpable cutaneous or sub -cutaneous lesions. For patients on continuous anticoagulant therapy, study -
specific biopsies should not be done unless local guidelines to mitigate the risk of hemorrhage are 
followed and the procedure can be done with minimal risk for the patient . 
 
Genomic , immunohistochemistry  and proteomic analyses of the collected tumor tissue  may be performed 
to identify biomar kers predictive of response or resistance to  HS-110/HS -130, for example by [CONTACT_857229] ( mIHC). Immunohistochemistry analysis using multiplexed immune markers  on 
the collected on-treatment biopsy and could  be compared to baseline biopsy to study effect of HS -110/HS -
130 combination treatment on patient tumors  and could be correlated with clinical response . This 
exploratory analysis could change in line with scientific understanding and technical development as the 
clinical study progresses. Please note that pre- treatment and/or post -treatment tissue samples will only 
be collected if it poses limited risk to the patient.  
 9.0 STATISTICS  
Demographic data and disease -related characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
(count and percent, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum). Continuous variables will

A. Background &  Significance  
 
Residual neuromuscular blockade after surgery can result in airway compromise, pulmonary 
complications, and possible need for reintubation an d can be a negative experience for patients. 
Reintubation after surgery is currently a quality measure in NSQIP (National Surgery Quality 
Improvement Program) A  Train of Four  (TOF ) monitor  ratio of <0.[ADDRESS_784554] shown that 
reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex results in a faster and more reliable return 
to TOF ratio of >0.[ADDRESS_784555] of these studies primarily 
report on TOF ratios. There are scant data on clinical outcomes after reversal with neostigmine 
versus sugammadex. Incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_65515] a clinically meaningful measurement of postoperativ e 
pulmonary function, i.e. the ability to breathe deeply, which minimizes atelectasis and risk of 
postoperative pneumonia.  
 
Our hypothesis is that sugammadex (2 mg/kg for intermediate blockade and 4 mg/kg for deep 
blockade per manufacturer’s package inser t) will be associated with and a better recovery profile 
in the PACU when compared to a standard practice dose of neostigmine ( 70 mcg/kg). Our primary 
outcome is incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_594653], which is a validated measure of postoperative 
pulmonary func tion. We also hypothesize that sugammadex will also be associated with a shorter 
time to extubation. Recent publications by [CONTACT_594672] (2013) have defined prolonged times to 
extubation as 15 minutes from the end of surgery. A prolonged time to extubation neg atively 
affects OR workflow.   
 
Regarding dose selection, the dose finding study by [CONTACT_594673] (2007) found that there was 
significant variability in recovery times to TOF ratio of >0.9 when patients were reversed from 
profound neuromuscular blockade with Su gammadex 2 mg/kg. A study by [CONTACT_594674] (2015) 
used Sugammadex (2 or 4 mg/kg) and in comparison with neostigmine found elimination of 
residual neuromuscular  blockade in the PACU (TOF ratio >0.9), and shorter times from study drug 
to extubation and OR disch arge.  
 
We have designed this study to reflect routine anesthesia practice. Providers will be instructed to 
aim for a level o f neuromuscular blockade (using  rocuronium ) of [ADDRESS_784556] not measured pulmonary function or objective measures of strength in the 
PACU. Bastin (1997) report ed the use of incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_335829] a simple means of assessing lung 
function in postoperative lobectomy patients showing good correlation with vital capacity and 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594654]. A recent study by [INVESTIGATOR_72335] -Guerrero (2011) also had used incenti ve 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_594655] a randomized clinical trial of sternal 
closure devices after cardiac surgery.  
 
Hand Grasp will be measured using a Jamar Dynamometer. This will be measured preoperatively 
and postoperatively i n the PACU. This mode of assessing hand grasp has been used in a previous 
Sugammadex study by [CONTACT_594675] (2015) to assess muscle strength in post anesthesia patients.  
 
Quality of recovery will be assessed using the QOR 15 described by [CONTACT_594676] (2013). This is a 
validated, extensive and efficient tool to assess a patient’s quality of recovery.  
 
B. Objectives & Hypotheses  
 
Primary outcome:  
Strength to breath e deeply (inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594656]) using incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_594657] – 
30 min, 60 min and 120 min after reversal of neuromuscular blockade.  
 
Secondary outcomes : 
1. Grip strength in PACU – 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min after reversal  
2. Able to sit up unaided  in PACU – 30 min, 60 min and 120 min after reversal  
3. Time to extubation (Percentage of prolonged extubation)  
4. Time to readiness for PACU discharge (Aldrete score)  
5. Reintubation in PACU  
6. Adverse Events  
7. TOF Ratio upon PACU admission  
8. QOR [ADDRESS_784557] a faster onset and more reliable reversal of neuromuscular 
blockade when compared to neostigmine as measured by [CONTACT_594677] >0.9. Our 
hypothesis is that sugammadex will be associated with improved deep br eathing as measured by 
[CONTACT_594678][INVESTIGATOR_594653].  
 
Patients who are reversed with sugammadex have a lower incidence of residual postoperative 
residual neuromuscular blockade when compared to neostigm ine. We hypothesize that patients 
reversed with s ugammadex will have better recovery profiles in the PACU as measured by [CONTACT_594679]. Additionally, we hypothesize that sugamm adex will be associated 
with shorter time to extubation compared to neostigmine.

9. Surgery where the patient’s arm is not 
available for neuromuscular monitoring  
10. A plan to extubate under deep anesthesia  
 
Anesthesia : Induction and maintenance of anesthesia will be at the discretion of the providing 
anesthesiologist. Midazolam (max 2 mg) can be administered prior to induction of GA.  Fentanyl 
(1-3 mcg/kg) will be administered around the time of induction and intubation, and can be 
administered as needed (1 -2 mcg /kg/hour). Additional fentanyl, or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], can be 
administered if determined to be appropriate by [CONTACT_101034]. For patients who receive 
dilaudid, a conversion of dilaudid 1.[ADDRESS_784559] discretion.  Anesthesiolog ists will be asked to aim for a depth of neuromuscular 
blockade of 1 -2 twitches on train of four (TOF) nerve stimulation.  Train of four monitoring via 
peripheral nerve stimulator at the ulnar nerve will be used.  
 
Patients will be assigned a randomization group prior to surgery, however the anesthesiologist will 
only be notified of study arm assignment 15 minutes prior to expected end of surgery to avoid 
bias/confounding due to possible differences in patient management earlier in the case if 
assignment was  known earlier.   
 
Group 1: Sugammadex: 2 mg/kg for moderate to shallow block  (2-4 twitches on TOF) , 4 mg/kg 
for profound block  (1-[ADDRESS_784560] tetanic twitches only)  
Group 2: Neostigmine: 7 0 mcg/kg with Glycopyr rolate 10 mcg/kg.  
 
Patients will receive reversal of neuromuscular blockade immediately after closure of the surgical 
wound, as defined as the last staple or the last suture. This is consistent with routine anesthesia 
practice.  
 
Version 5, September 25, [ADDRESS_784561] regained full muscle strength (5 second head lift or sustained tetanus without fade), follow 
simple verbal commands (e.g. lift head), and breathe spontaneously with acceptable oxygenation 
and ventilatio n (At least 8 breaths per minute, and a tidal volume of greater than 5 mL/kg).  
 
Additional neuromuscular blockade reversal can be administered at the discretion of the primary 
anesthesiologist. This additional reversal can be given if the patient demonstrates residual 
neuromuscular blockade that is preventing extubation [ADDRESS_784562]. 
Need for additional reversal agent and drug crossovers will be collected as an outcome between 
groups.  
 
Data Collection:  Preoperative information will be collected for each patient including age, BMI, 
medical comorbidities, sex, ASA class, race/ethnicity. In the pre -operative  holding area, baseline 
measurements of hand grip and incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] w ill be measured.  
 
Intraoperative data will be collected by [CONTACT_594680]. 
Intraoperative data will include total dose of rocuronium, time of last rocuronium dose, TOF prior 
to administration of reversal, time of reversal  agent, time of extubation, time of OR discharge, 
surgical procedure, duration of surgery (surgery start to surgery stop) and duration of anesthesia 
(anesthesia start to anesthesia stop). TOF ratio will be measured with TOF -watch SX 
acceleromyograph. The u nblinded research coordinator will accompany the patient from the OR 
to PACU and measure TOF ratio upon PACU admission.  
 
The patient will be assessed in the PACU by a research coordinator/assistant blinded to the 
patient’s randomization. The research coord inator/assistant will not be directly involved in the 
patient’s care. Incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (measured with a n incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007]), hand grip strength 
(measured with a Jamar dynamometer), and ability to sit independently will be assessed at 30, 60 
and 120 minutes from reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Level of sedation will be measured at 
30, 60 and 120 minutes using the RASS sedation scale. Time to PACU readiness will also be 
assessed using the Aldrete score.  
 
The 120 -minute measurement will be complete d even if the patient has been discharged from the 
PACU prior to this time. If a patient is ready for discharge home prior to 120 minutes, they will 
remain longer in the holding area to complete the 120 -minute assessment. The patient consent will 
allow for  this provision.  
 
24 hours after surgery, patients will complete a QOR15 survey either in person (if still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] ) 
or via telephone from a research coordinator/assistant blinded to the patient’s study arm 
assignment.

D. Study Procedures  
 
Patients who are scheduled for surgery at Stony Brook Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594658]/exclusion criteria. Explanation of the research protocol and consent will be obtained 
during the preoperative period allowing patients sufficient time to d ecide if they wish to participate 
in this study. Once patients have consented to participate, they will be assigned a unique 
identification number.  
 
Patients will be randomized (1:1) to either the neostigmine or sugammadex group. When enrolling 
patients, we will divide patients into short (expected < 2 hours) or long (expected > 2 hours) 
surgical groups and have separate randomization lists for these two durations of surgery. This will 
allow us to ensure balance of this important confounding variable betwe en study groups.  
 
Patients will be evaluated in the preoperative area to obtain their medical history, demographic 
information, and type of surgery. Preoperatively, we will obtain hand grasp, and incentive 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_258229]. For each incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_280804], patients will use the device 
three times. Each volume will be recorded and the largest volume will be used for analysis. To 
avoid confounding factors of patient position, we will standardize our measurements: patients will 
be sittin g at a 45 -degree angle in a stretcher, unless there are medical contraindications to this 
positioning.

Version 5, September 25, 2017  The patients will undergo anesthesia and surgery and receive either neostigmine or sugammadex 
based on their group assignment. Intraoperative informatio n will be collected regarding the 
duration of surgery, time to extubation, and information about use and depth of neuromuscular 
blockade. In the PACU, patients will be assessed by a blinded assessor for hand grip strength, 
incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_594659], an d ability to sit independently. Time to PACU discharge readiness 
will be assessed using the Aldrete score. The patients will be surveyed 24 hours after surgery using 
the QOR 15 to assess their quality of recovery.  
 
This will then complete their participat ion in the study.  
 
E. Statistical Analysis and Sample Size Justification  
 
Statistical procedures/analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_20767]’s biostatistician.  
 
Randomization : Randomization will be performed using a sealed envelope technique.  Envelopes 
will no t be reused in any case.  Two computer generated randomization schema, in permuted 
blocks, will be provided by [CONTACT_20767]’s statistician, one for short cases and one for long cases.  
 
Unblinding Process : The investigator and the PACU assessor will remain bli nded to patient 
allocation during this study. The primary anesthesiologist conducting the anesthesia for these 
patients will not be blinded to their allocation, for purposes of appropriate and safe reversal of 
neuromuscular blockade. An unblinded member of  the study team will record intraoperative 
information for each patient to which the primary investigator will blinded to until final analysis. 
After all patients have completed the study and all data has been collected, the clinical database 
will be locke d and unblinded for statistical analysis.

rocuronium) will be used to compare that both study groups have  similar characteristics. Incentive 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_594661]. Secondary outcomes will look at 
time to extubation and measures of PACU recovery with relation to agent used for reversal of 
neuromuscular blockade.  
 
Statisti cal Methods  
 
Primary Outcome:  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_594662], PACU 30, 60 and 120 minutes after reversal 
of neuromuscular blockade  
A “change from baseline” spi[INVESTIGATOR_594663] 30, 60 and 120 time 
points for each patient. A rep eated measures (mixed) ANOVA will be performed comparing the 
mean spi[INVESTIGATOR_594664] 30, [ADDRESS_784565] 3 things: 1 – is there a difference in mean spi[INVESTIGATOR_594665]; 2 - does spi[INVESTIGATOR_594666]; and 3 – is there a group/time 
interaction, specifically, does the sugammadex group spi[INVESTIGATOR_594667]? Alpha will be set at 0. 05.  
Secondary outcomes:  There will be six secondary outcomes:  
1. Grip strength in PACU – 30 min, 60 min and 120 min  
2. Able to sit up unaided in PACU – 30 min, 60 min and 120 in  
3. Time to extubation (Percentage of prolonged extubation)  
4. Time to readiness for PACU  discharge (Aldrete score)  
5. TOF ratio upon PACU admission  
6. QoR 15 
Version 5, September 25, 2017  We will use a Bonferroni correction for multiplicity, thus, each secondary outcome will be tested 
at the alpha of 0.008 (0.05/6 = 0.008) level for significance. We plan to test the [ADDRESS_784566], and appropriate analytical methods will be 
used. A repeated measures ANOVA (or Friedmen’s test) will be  used to test for group differences 
in grip strength over time. T -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to test for differences 
in treatment groups for Aldrete score and QOR15 score. Chi -Square and Fisher exact tests will be 
used to examine for gro up differences in proportion of first sit time, prolonged extubation and TOF 
ratio upon PACU admission.  
1. Grip strength in PACU – 30 min, 60 min and 120 min  – A repeated measures ANOVA will 
be used to test for group differences in grip strength over time.  
2. Able to sit unaided in PACU – 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min  – A chi square/fisher’s exact test 
will be used to see if there is a difference between the 2 groups ’ ability to sit independently.  
3. Time to extubation (Percentage of prolonged extubation)  – Prolong ed extubation is defined 
as 15 minutes after end of surgery. Time to extubation will be dichotomized into either YES - 
prolonged, or NO - normal. Chi Square or Fisher’s exact tests will be performed to test for 
significant differences in proportion between g roups.  
4. Time to readiness for PACU discharge (Aldrete score)  – Either t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum 
tests will be performed to assess the difference in mean/rank Aldrete score.  
5. TOF Ratio upon PACU admission  – Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests will be performed to 
test for significant differences in proportion between groups.  
6. QoR 15 – Either t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be performed to assess the 
differences in mean/rank QoR15 score.  
Reintubation i n PACU:  Because we anticipate reintubation rates to be 0% for both groups, this 
variable will not be a secondary outcome, but rather an adverse event worth reporting.  
Drug crossover : We will collect and analyze the incidence of drug crossovers for each gr oup. This 
is defined as patients who received the initial neuromuscular reversal, but then were given the 
other neuromuscular reversal agent due to residual paralysis.  
 
Analysis Population:  Our primary population for data analysis will be a “modified inten tion to 
treat” groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Any patient who received a neuromuscular blockade reversal agent (neostigmine 
or sugammadex) will be included in this population. Patients who received neither reversal agent 
(i.e. patients who remain intubated after surgery) will be excluded from this primary population 
analysis. Our secondary population for analysis will be “actual medication received.” Patients 
will be included in the group of which reversal agent they actually received, in the event that the 
wrong reversal agent  is given. Patients who receive both reversal agents (drug crossover) will be 
excluded from this secondary population analysis. Drug crossovers will be collected as a separate 
outcome measure.  
 
Power/Sample Size  
We believe that a 20% difference in incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_594668]. We 
anticipate that patients will have a preoperative incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_594669] 2200mL and a 
postoperative incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_594670] 1540 mL with regular care. A 20%  difference with 
sugammadex would translate to 300 mL increase in inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594656] (1840 mL vs 1540 
mL):  
Version 5, September 25, 2017  300 mL difference in volume (assuming a standard deviation of +/ - 400 mL ):  
Group 1: 1540 mL +/ - 400 mL  
Group 2: 1840 mL  
Enrollment Ratio 1:1, alpha 0.05 and power 80%   Total  sample size required is 60 patients. 
The study expects to enroll about 80 subjects to end with 60 “randomizable” subjects after 
accounting for screen failures, withdrawals or surgery cancelations.  
 
F. Adverse Experience Reporting  
 
Safety evaluation:  For this Phase 4 (post marketing) study serious adverse events (SAE s) that may 
occur during the study will be recorded in the case report form. The AE record in the case report 
form includes the nature of the event (with onset date and time, end date and time) severity, 
treatment, outcome, and the relationship to the treat ment given. All serious AEs that require 
reporting will be reported to the medical ethics committee and authorities as required by [CONTACT_27727]/GRP 
guidelines.

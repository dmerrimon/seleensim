 Summary of Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
 
The administration of OC-01 0.6 mg/mL and 1.2 mg/mL (varenicline) Nasal S pray was safe, well 
tolerated, and efficacious as assessed in the ONSET-1 study. The study met the primary endpoint 
(Schirmer’s Test) for both the 0.6 mg/mL and 1.2 mg/mL dose  groups . It also met the secondary 
symptom endpoints (EDS) for 0.6 mg/mL OC -01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray. There was not a 
statistically significant improvement in EDS in the normal environment at Day 28 for the 1.2 
mg/mL dose, although there was a numerical benefit as compared to placebo.  Because of the 
pre-specified hierarchical approach to multip licity for the seconda ry outcomes, the EDS 
symptoms within the CAE® environment at Day 21 could not be formally tested; however, the 
data strongly suggest benefit on that outcome as well. Although the low dose of 0.12 mg/mL OC-
01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray demonstrated statistical significance in Schirmer’s Score in 
exploratory analyses, this dose did not yield statistically significant difference in the symptom 
endpoint in exploratory analyses as measured by [CONTACT_494161].   
Showing statistical significance in both signs and symptoms of DED in the same study population 
is a goal seldom before achieved in the treatment of the disease.  Importantly, after treatment with 
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray, improvements in EDS were seen as early as 5 minutes after 
administration in the CAE® in the 0.6 mg/mL and 1.2 mg/mL OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal S pray 
dose groups.  Exploratory analyses of fluorescei n corneal staining indica te a benefit in subjects 
treated with OC -01 (varenicline) Nasal S pray compared to those subjects treated with placebo.   
 
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray was safe and well- tolerated at all concentrations assessed in the 
ONSET -[ADDRESS_635662] common AE in all treatment groups was sneezing which was temporally related to the 
administration of the study drug and resolved within  a short period of time after administration.  
Sneezing AEs were characterized as mild to modera te, with no severe AEs reported. 
 
All AEs that were suspected to be related to the study drug with the exception of AE s with each of 
the following terms; nasal dryness, nasal congestion and throat irritation were reported to be 
recovered/or resolved before  study completion.  Eleven ocular TEAEs were reported, 7 of which 
were reported in the placebo group; all other AEs were classified as non -ocular. The Investigators 
considered 3 of the 7 ocular TEAEs (visual acui ty reduced, conjunctival hemorrhage, and eyelid 
oedema) to be possibly related to study drug, all resolved, and none was categorized as severe. 
One treatment -emergent SAE (anemia) was reported and was considered to be unrelated to study 
drug. No treatment -related treatment-emergent SAEs were observe d. No deaths occurred during 
the study. Visual acuity, slit -lamp biomicroscopy, intranasal examination, and pupil diameter did 
not indicate clinically significant changes from baseline. These data  from the ONSET-[ADDRESS_635663] that 28 days of BID delivery  of OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray is safe and efficacious in 
subjects with DED.  DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

9 SAFETY DEFINITIONS, SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING 
9.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unt oward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered drug-related.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintende d sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease occurring after the subj ect started dosing with the study drug, without 
any judgment about causality.  Any pre-ex isting medical condition that worsens after 
administration of the study drug will also be considered a new AE.   
Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation and placebo. 
AE collection will start following the first ad ministration of study drug until the last follow 
up visit of the study.     
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action(s) tak en, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_183175]. 
9.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as 
determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_102]/s ubject.  The assessment 
of severity is made irrespective of relationship to study drug or seriousness of the event and 
should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
x Mild:  Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
x Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
x Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_635687] should be determined by [CONTACT_093] (in a blinded manner) using these explanations: 
x Definite:  When there are good reason and sufficient documentation to demonstrate a 
direct causal relationship between investigational product and AE DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-101  
Amendment #1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 of 55 
 x Probable: When there are good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a 
causal relationship in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely but not necessarily highly probable 
x Possible: When there is sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal relationship in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the connection is uncertain or doubtful, for example; due to missing data or 
insufficient evidence. 
x None: When there is sufficient information to accept a lack of a causal relationship, in the sense of impossible and improbable . 
x Unclassified: When the causal relationship is not assessable for whatever reason due 
to insufficient evidence, conflicting data or poor documentation.  
9.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be deter mined based upon existing safety information 
about the study drug using these explanations: 
x Unexpected:  An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed . 
x Expected: An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed.  
x Not Applicable: Any AE that is unrelated to the study drug. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with 
the particular drug under investigati on are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final classification is subject to th e Medical Monitor’s determination.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE is considered “serious ” (SAE) if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: 
x Death 
 
x A life-threatening AE 
Note: An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator 
or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death. 
x Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494154]: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

 Note: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if 
less than 24 hours).  For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission includes 
transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit.  Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]:  emergency room visits; outpatient/same-
day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities;

Note:  The term “prolongation of existing hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of 
an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494155] e investigator or treating physician. 
x A persistent or significant incapacity or subs tantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
Note:  An SAE specifically related to visual threat would be interpreted as any 
potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., hemorrhage, retinal 
detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve). 
x A congenital anomaly/birth defect in an offspring of a study subject. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212231], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to

10 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Statistical considerations and methods of analyses for this study are provided below; the 
accompanying Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) contains complete details of the planned 
analyses.  
10.1 Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint: 
x Percent of subjects who achieve ≥10 mm improvement in Schirmer’s Test Score from 
baseline at Visit 4 (Day 28)  
Secondary Endpoints 
x Mean change from Baseline in Eye Dryness  Score (EDS) at 5 minutes after threshold 
defined treatment administration in the Controlled Adverse Environment® Chamber 
at Visit 4 (Day 28) 
x Mean change from Baseline in Eye Dryne ss Score (EDS) at Visit 4 (Day 28) (Post 
STS) 
x Mean change from Baseline in Schirmer’s Test Score  (STS) at Visit 4 (Day 28) 
x Mean change from Baseline in Corneal Fluorescein Staining at Visit 4 (Day 28) 
10.2 Analysis Populations 
10.2.1 Intention-To-Treat Population  
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomized subjects. Analyses using the 
ITT population will group subjects according to the treatment to which they were randomized.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_635694] one dose of 
the study drug. Analysis on the safety population will group subjects according to the 
treatment actually received.  DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

 10.3 Statistical Hypotheses 
Let p l, ph, and p p denote the percent of subjects in each group (low dose, high dose, and 
placebo, respectively) who have ≥  10mm change from baseline to Visit 4 in STS. 
 H 0: pl – p p = 0 or p h – p p = 0 
 H 1: pl – p p ≠ 0 or p h – p p ≠ [ADDRESS_635695] s in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_635696] e ndpoint assessments at Visit 4. 
For the primary endpoint, the percent of subjects achieving > 10 mm improvement from 
Baseline in STS at Visit 4,  the ONSET-1 study had roughly 15% of subjects in the placebo 
group and 50% in each of the 0.6 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml groups.  If the true proportion achieving at least a 10 mm improvement is 15% in the placebo group and, conservatively, 
40% in each of the active arms, the power  for each dose would be greater than 99%.
 
The secondary endpoint is the EDS test. The ONSET-[ADDRESS_635697] deviation (SD) of roughly [ADDRESS_635698] approximately 99% power for each dose. 
 
10.5 Statistical Analysis 
This section briefly outlines the planned efficacy analyses. The statistical analysis plan (SAP) 
describes the methods to be used in detail. If the SAP and the protocol disagree, the details 
and methods of the SAP will prevail.

 APPENDIX 2: EXAMINATION PROCEDURES, TESTS, EQUIPMENT, AND 
TECHNIQUES  
The following examination procedures, tests, equipment and techniques are listed in this 
Appendix:  
Visual Acuity Procedures  
LogMAR visual acuity must be assessed using an ETDRS chart. The procedure used will be 
consistent with the recommendations provided for using the ETDRS eye chart. Visual acuity 
should be evaluated at the beginning of each visit in the study (i.e., prior to slit lamp 
examination). Participants should use the most recent correction to attain their corrected 
distance visual acuity (CDVA); if they forget thei r spectacles, this prescription can be placed 
in a trial frame. 
Equipment 
The visual acuity chart to be used is the ETDRS chart. If smaller reproduction (18" by 18", 
e.g., from Prevent Blindness) wall charts are us ed, the participant viewing distance should be 
exactly 10 feet (or as specified by [CONTACT_3455]). In ALL cases, for purposes of standardizing the testing conditions during the study, all sites must use only ETDRS Series 
2000 Chart 1 & 2, and the right eye should be tested first. For reflectance (wall) charts, the chart should be placed frontally and be well illuminated. 
Measurement Technique 
The chart should be at a comfortable viewing angle. The right eye should be tested first. The 
participant should attempt to read each letter, li ne-by-line, left to right, beginning with line 1 
at the top of the chart. The participant should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers. If the participant reads a number, s/he should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number. The 
participant should be asked to read slowly, so as to achieve the best identification of each 
letter. S/he is not to proceed to the next letter until s/he has given a definite response. 
If the participant changes a response (e.g., 'that was a "C" not an "O"') before s/he has read 
aloud the next letter, then the change must be  accepted. If the participant changes a response 
having read the next letter, then the change is not accepted. The examiner should never point 
to the chart or to specific letters on the chart during the test. 
A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart. When the participant 
says s/he cannot read a letter, s/he should be en couraged to guess. If the participant identifies 
a letter as one of two letters, s/he should be asked to choose one letter and, if necessary, to 
guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, despi[INVESTIGATOR_494157], the examiner should stop the test for that eye. However, all 
letters on the last line should be attempted as letter difficulties vary and the last may be the 
only one read correctly. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted. DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

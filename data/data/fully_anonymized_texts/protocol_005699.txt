1. Intr oducti on 
 
Patients with loca lized TNBC are preferably treated with systemic chemotherapy in t he 
neoadjuvant se tting (NACT) as this a llo
ws for clo se monitoring of respon se in the inta ct primar y 
tumor and often results in ‘down stagi ng’ of tumor s, which increases the f easibility of breas t 
conserving surgery. The respon se to NACT at the time of surgical resection can be determine d 
by m easuring the amount of resi dual cancer remai ning in the brea st and draining lymph nod es 
du
ring routine pathologic evaluation and is su ch a powerful i ndicator of pro gnosis that the Fo od 
and Drug Administration (FDA) has reco gnized si gnificant improvement in complete respon se to 
neoadjuvant therapy as a pathway to drug approval. Investigators at MDACC ha ve develope d 
and va lidated a scoring system known as the Resi dual Cancer Burden ( RCB) to quantify th e 
extent of r esidual disea se remaining after NACT and surgical resection .[2] Approximately 50% of 
p
atients with loca lized TNBC treated with sta ndard taxane/anthracyc line-based NACT w ill have 
either pathologic compete respon se (pCR/RCB-0 ) or minima l residual disease  (RCB-I ) at the tim e 
of surgical resection and tho se patients have identical and exceptionally g ood long-ter m prognosis 
with le ss than 10% ri sk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_250889] 5 y ears. Unfortunately, 
those with more extensi ve residual disease (RCB-II o r RCB- III) have a mu ch worse prognosis, with 
50%-80% of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_250889] 3 years of initi al diagnosis .[3] 
Additionally, c linical trials of NACT in brea st cancer have demonstrated that patient s without 
respon se to their fir st chemotherapeutic regimen have very lo w chance (5%) 
of achievi ng pCR after 
their second n eoadjuvant chemotherapy regim en.[4] However, this has not b een the case with 
targeted regimens such as trastuzumab in HER2+ tumor s, suggesting that intrinsi c resistan ce 
to chemotherapy can be overcom e with appropriat e  targeted therapy. [5] Though several targeted 
agents hav e been
 tested for treatment in TNBC, so far none have be en successful. The underlying 
causes of this fa ilure are commonly a ttributed to the molecul ar heterogeneity of tumors cla ssified 
within the ‘cat ch all’ category of TNBC as well as the d ilution effects of chemotherapy sensitive 
disease whi ch requires c linical trials to enroll larger number of patients to show be nefit of 
combined targeted ther apy/chemotherapy regimens over sta ndard c hemotherapy. A dditiona lly, 
clonal selection of resistant cells with e scape mechanisms al so likely develop s. Recent advances 
in gene expre ssion profi ling have identifie d  subgro ups of triple- negative brea st cancer (TNBC) 
with distin ct molecular f eatures that, if a ppropriately selected , may be more responsi ve to targeted 
therapy with existing FDA-a pproved drug s, leading to rapi d improvement of outcomes in this high-
risk 
breast cancer population [1, 6-8]. 
 
Prediction of chemosensitivity a nd  molecu lar abe rrations a ssociated with TNBC s ubtype s: Our 
collaborator, [CONTACT_250918] s, and his t eam have developed micr oarray-based predictive si gnatures 
of chemotherapy respon se using fre sh primary tumor tiss ue 
obtained from a routine biop sy of br east cancer at the time of 
diagnosis or surgery. This appr oach  has b een retrospectively 
validated and tested for f easibility using a prospective registr y 
study (MDACC c linical trial 2011 -0007).[9] The propose d 
predicto r  was  teste d  on  an  independent  cohor t  of  breast 
cancers i rrespective of receptor status (N=198, 99% with c linical 
Stage II-I II) who received n eoadjuvant (N=180) or adjuvan t 
(N=18) taxane-anthracyc line chemotherapy. Predictions wer e 
accurate i f  ER+/HER2- (30% predicted sensitive, Distant 
relapse-free survival (DRFS) 97%, CI 91-100; Absolute risk 
reduction (A RR) 11 %, CI 0.1- 21) or ER-/HER2- ( 26% predicted 
sensitive, DRFS 83%, CI 68-1 00; ARR 26%, CI 4-48) (Fig 1) .[9] 
Predicted treatment sensitivity was si gnificantly a ssociated with 
lower relap se risk (HR 0.19, CI 0. 07-0.55) in a multivariat e 
model including ER statu s, tumor and nodal stage, grade, ag e, 
and type of taxane tr eatment (pac litaxel or docetaxel ).

features targetable with existing FDA approved dr ugs.[1, 7, 10, 11] 
Basal- like TNBCs (BL1 and BL2) are h eavily enriched in cell cycl e 
and cell division pathway s. Gene exp ression prof iling has reveale d 
that the se tumors have high expre ssion of proliferation genes suc h 
as aurora kinase s, MYC , NRAS and PLK1 as wel l as elevated DNA 
damage respon se (BL1 s ubtype) . These tumors may have higher

subtype s. The BL2 subset displays gene ontologies involvi ng 
growth factor si gnaling such as EGFR and IGF1R pathway s. Cell 
lines cla ssified as basal- like had high rates of sensitivity to cisplati n 
and relati ve resistan ce to PI3K directed therapy in both cell culture 
and xenograft model s. Though mo st triple-negative br east cancers are cla ssified as basal- like 
(BL1  and  BL2)  by  [CONTACT_250903] y  analysi s,  approximatel y  30%  of  triple  negativ e  tumor s  are 
molecularl y  distin ct  from  basal- like  breast  cancer s  as  they  displa y  mesenchyma l  feature s, 
includin g   enrichmen t   in   epi[INVESTIGATOR_250891]-to-mesenchyma l   transitio n   (EMT )   an d   stem-cel l   like 
characteristi cs. Subgro ups with the se features ha ve been identified by i ndependent investigator s 
and have been termed mesenchymal (M),
 mesenchymal-stem cell like (MSL) and cla udin-low . 
Mesenchymal- like  TNBC s  carr y  a  high  rate  of  molecula r  abe rration s  that  activat e  the 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis s uggesting that this subgr oup may be responsi ve to therapeutic regimen s 
targetin g  this  pathway .  Approximatel y  10-15%  of  TNB C  are  associate d  with  expre ssion  of 
androge n  recepto r  (AR+ o r  LAR) and approximatel y  20-25%  are imm une mo dulatory  (IM),  
expressing genes a ssociated with imm une activation. Approximately 10- 20% of patients wit h 
TNBC are carriers of germ line B RCA1/[ADDRESS_305123], pCR rates sim ilar 
to  slightly  higher  than  non-ca rriers.[1 2 ]  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  are  required  for  homologou s 
recombination repai r of DNA strand brea ks leading to a defe ct in DNA repai r in cancers harbo ring 
such mutation s. As such, the se tumors may be more sensiti ve to chemotherapy inducing DNA 
breaks or poly ADP-ribo se polymera se (PARP) inhibitor s. 
 
Notably, investigators at MDACC al so determined that rates of p CR/RCB-I to sta ndard NA CT 
were not statistically different amongst the s ubtypes, though the lowe st rates of pC R were s een i n 
the BL-[ADDRESS_305124] rates of RCB-III disease was within the mesenchyma l subtype s, 
further va lidating the n eed for both predictors of chemotherapy sensitivity as well as molecul ar 
characterization of predicted chemotherapy-ins ensitive disea se to determine a ppropriate therap y 
for patients with loca liz
ed TNBC .[13] 
 
Given the disparity of treatment outcomes from NACT for TNBC, a molecular triaging protoco l 
(MDACC 20 14-0185) has b een developed and IRB approved as a dia gnostic platform to identify 
patients who se tumors are likely or 
unlikely to achieve pCR or RCB-I, i n 
order to dire ct predicted respo nders 
toward sta ndard chemotherapy and to

All patients w ill then initiate a pla nned [ADDRESS_305125] neoadjuvant anthracyc line bas ed

Molecular c haracte rization of the tumor (if known) can also be used by [CONTACT_250906] t rials within the BMO n eoadjuvant c linical trials portfolio (Figure 4). 
 
Additionally, becau se of the 2:1 ra ndomization in 2014-0185 (Figure 3), a subgroup of patien ts 
molecularly profiled w ill not k now the results for decision making (control arm). Li ke the

design. Likewise, patients who se tumors do not ha ve luminal androgen receptor (LAR) f eatures 
can be enro lled on this protocol and receive Enzalutamide, whi ch will allow a control group of 
non-LA R TNBCs to serve as a contro l to determine the predictive value of potential biomarkers to 
define the mesenchymal po pulation.

androgen/estroge n metabo lism regardle ss of a negati ve IHC for estrogen receptor. [1, 13] LAR 
has other distin guishing c linical characteristi cs as we ll. Our previous data shows that the p CR 
rate di ffered according to molecular s ubtype within TNBC and that the LA R subtype is associat ed 
with a lo w pCR rate (0.1 %; 95% CI: 0.003-0.23) but with a high RCB-I rate, however, the surviv al 
outcome is relatively be tter compared to the other subtypes su ch as IM, MSL, or BL2 .[13] This 
characteristic of low pCR rate and yet be tter survival outcome is sim ilar to t hat
 of hormon e 
receptor positi ve breast cancer. As a s upporting data, genome-wide tran script analysis usi ng 
DNA microa rrays shows that a s ubset of ER/PR-negative cancer resembles ER-positive brea st 
cancer, and this subtype contains AR-responsive gene s. Thus, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_250892]/PR-negative br east cancer with s uch characteristi cs.[17] In vitro experimen t 
using MDA-MB-[ADDRESS_305129] on overall cell viab ility. In the experiment using the same cell line, inc ubation wit h  a 
synthetic a ndrogen (R- 1881 ) stimulated growth and this pro liferati ve effect was abrogated by [CONTACT_3433] e 
addition of the A R antagoni st flutamide, confirming that the respon se was A R depe ndent and ER 
independent. [17] These data s uggest that therapeutic AR blo cka de warranted consideration as a 
potential e ndocrine therapy for the subset of patients with E R negative br east cancer .[18] 
 
In the previous Pha se II study investigating the efficacy of Bical utamide in patients’ estrog en 
receptor and progesterone receptor negative, a ndrogen positive (IHC > 10% nuclear staini ng) 
metastatic br east cancer, the 6-month c linical benefit rate was 19% (95% CI, 7-39%), and t he 
median PFS was 12 w eeks (95% CI, 11-22 wee ks).[19] E nzalutamide is an androgen-receptor– 
signaling inhibito r and is distin ct from the cu rrently available antia ndrogen agents in that it inhibi ts 
nuclear translocation of the a ndrogen receptor, DNA binding, and c oactivator recruitment. It al so 
has a greater affinity for the receptor, i nduces tumor shrinkage in xenograft models (in whi ch 
conventional agents only retard growth), and has no known agonistic effects. [20, 21] 
 
Of note, prec linical dat a in prostate cancer cell lines have shown that enzalutamide has a 
synergic effe ct with taxane via the AR pathway, and the prostate cancer cell lines may ha ve a 
cross-resistan ce between taxanes and enzalutamide when the se drugs were use d 
sequentia lly.[22, 23] A pha se I study of prostate cancer patients showed that enzalutamide doe s 
not have a clinically si gnificant e ffect on docetaxel PK when the se drugs were use d 
concu rrently .[24] 
 
 
Study Rationale: 
Based on the above mentioned data, it is hypothesized that among patients with AR-positi ve 
TNBC who were non-respo nders to initial anthracyc line and cyclo phosphamide chemotherapy, ZT 
regimen (the combination of enzalutamide and w eekly pac litaxel) administered in the n eoadjuvan t 
setting increases pCR and RCB-I rates compared with conventional taxane-based chemotherapy. 
 
Rationale f or Correlati ve Studies: 
Optional t umor ti ssue w ill be co llected prior to begi nning enzalutamide therapy and at the time of 
surgery . Peripheral blood w ill be collected prior to beginning enzalutamide, after six cycles of 
paclitaxel , and at the time of surgery (see above “St udy Schema” on page3). The se samples w ill 
be used t o perfor m  correlati ve  studies  aime d  at  identifyin g  predictiv e  marker s  and  to  
enhance  our understa nding of the biology of AR posit ive TNBC. All st udies w ill be performed at 
MD A nde
rson. 
 
Gene prof iles and reverse phase protein ass ay (RPPA)/ RNA se quence s: The 
experiments using br east cancer ce lls are limited sin ce the mechanism and cro ss talk of 
androgen receptor si gnaling is st ill unclear in br east cancer. However, both in vitro and in 
vivo experiments using prostate cancer ce lls have been performed to investigate t he roles 
of androgen receptor si gnaling pathway. In prostate cancer, it is thought that ther e are 
two si gnaling pathway s; androgen-depe ndent and a ndrogen-i ndepe ndent si gnaling [25, 
26] PI3K/A kt pathway has b een shown to promote prostate cancer cell surviva l and

 growth via e nhancing AR-mediated tran scription. Both PTEN and the PI3K inhibito r 
negatively re gulate this proce ss. It is shown that the cro ss talk between the a ndrogen an d 
PI3K/A kt pathways is mediated through the m odulation of the PI3K/A kt downstr eam 
effector G SK3 β. Its inactivation by [CONTACT_250907] 
β-catenin, whi ch augment AR activity. These fi ndings delineate a novel mechani sm by 
[CONTACT_250908]3K/A kt and PTEN re gulate the androgen pathway dur ing prostate cell growt h   
and surviva l. [27] AR, the progesterone receptor (PR), and the estrogen receptor (ER) ar e 
able to activate the M APK/ERK thr ough a mechanism i ndependent of their tran scription al 
activity. AR has b een found to intera ct with the intracellular tyrosine kina se Src. One of 
the targets of Src is the adapter protein Shc, an upstr eam regulator of the M APK   
pathway. [26] 
 
Given there are some related proteins in AR si gnaling in prostate cancer, reverse phase 
protein a ssay (R PPA) and RNA se quences of relevant si gnaling pathways incl uding ERK , 
PI3K, S RC, PTEN, Akt, p53, EG FR,[COMPANY_004]3, β-catenin , IGF-IR, Raf, and MAPK w ill be 
performed on all biopsies to better underst and the molecular mechanism related to A R 
signaling and their changes by [CONTACT_171313]. The expre ssion level of tho se AR relate d 
genes will be also evaluated using an Affymetrix GeneChip. 
 
Circulating tumor ce lls (CTCs): CTCs are fo und in human bl ood when cancers undergo 
metastatic di ssemination and spread to distant organs .[28, 29] CTCs have been reporte d 
as a su rrogate marke r for tumor respon se and linked to shorter survival in metastati c 
breast, prostate and colorectal l ung cancer patients .[28, 30-34] CTCs al so carry hi ghly 
specific oncogenic mutations .[35] In prostate cancer cell lines, it has b een known tha t 
andr
ogen receptor si gnaling is activated by [CONTACT_250909] e 
nucleus where AR activates AR-target gene s. In vivo experiment using castrate resistan t 
prostate cancer patient s, taxane i nhibits AR nuclear loca lization and AR cytoplasmi c 
localizations co rrelated with c linical respon se to taxa ne. This may sugge st that monitori ng 
AR subce llular l ocalization in the CTCs might predi ct clin ical respon se to treatmen t 
blocking AR translocation such as enzalutamide . [36]

6.0 Drug Informati on: 
 
6.1 Enzalutamide (Xtandi ®) [38] 
 
Enzalutamide is a n androgen receptor i nhibitor that acts on di fferent steps in the androge n receptor-si gnaling 
pathway. Enzalutamide has b een shown to competitively inhibit androge n binding to a ndrogen receptors and 
inhibit androgen receptor nuclear translocation and interacti on with DNA. 
 
The mo st common adver se reactions ( ≥ 5%) observed with Enzalutamide are asthenia/fati gue, back pain, 
diarrhea, arthralgia, hot flush, peri pheral edema, musculo skeletal pain, h eadach e, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], 
muscular weakne ss, dizzine ss, insomnia, lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] , spi[INVESTIGATOR_250893] d cauda equina 
syndrome, hematuria, paresthesia, anxiety, an d hypertension. The mo st clinically important adver se effects a re 
discuss
ed below: 
 
Seizure  
 
In the ra ndomized pha se 3 study of patients with CRPC previously treated with docetaxe l (CRPC2), 0.9% of 
patients receiving enzalutamide ( 160 mg/da ily) experienced a seizure. Seizur e events o ccurred from 31 to 603 
days after initiation of enzalutamide. No seizures o ccurred i n patients tr eated with placebo. In the ra ndomized 
phase 3 study of chemotherapy naive patien ts treated with enzalutamide (MDV31 00-03), 1 enzaluta mide-treated 
patient ex perienced a seizur e and 1 placebo-tr eated patient experienced a seizure, leading to an inciden ce 
of 0.1% in bo th 
treatment gr oups. Patients experiencing seizure were permanently di sconti nued from therapy 
and all seizure events resolved. There is no clinical trial ex perience re-administe ring enzalutamide to patients 
who experienced seizure. Limited safety data are available in patients with pred isposi ng f actors for seizure 
becau se these patients were genera lly excl uded from the t rials. The se exclusion c riteria incl uded a history of 
seizure, underlying brain injury with lo ss of con sciousne ss, transient i schemic a ttack within the pa st 12 months, 
cerebrova scular a ccident, brain metastase s, and brain arteriovenous malformation. CRPC2 excl uded the u se of 
concomit ant medications th at may lower the seizure threshold, wherea s MDV 3100-03 permi tte d the u se of the se 
medication s. Becau se of the ri sk of seizure associated with enzalutamide use, patients should be advised of 
the ri sk of e ngaging in any activity where s udden lo ss of con sciousne ss could cau se serio us har m to 
themselves or ot hers. 
 
Laborato ry Abnormalities 
 
In the ra ndomized c linical trial, Grade 1-4 neutropenia o ccurred in 15% of patients on XTA NDI (1% Grade3-4) 
and in 6% of patients on placebo (no Grade 3-4). The inciden ce of Grade 1-4 thrombocytopenia was sim ilar in 
both arm s; 0.5% of patients on XTA NDI and 1% on placeb o experienced Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia. 
Grade 1-4 elevations in ALT o ccurred in 10% of patients on XTA NDI ( 0.3% Grade 3-4) and 18% of patients 
on placebo (0.5% Grade 3-4). Grad e 1-4 elevations in b ilirubin occurred in 3% of patients on XTA NDI  and 2% of 
patients on placebo.

Infections  
 
In the ra ndomized c linical trial, 1.0% of patients tr eated with XTA NDI compared to 0.3% of patients on 
placebo died from infections or sepsi s. Infection-related serious adver se events wer e reported in approximately 
6% of the patients on both tr eatment arm s. 
 
Falls and Fall-related Injuries  
 
In the ra ndomized c linica l trial, fa lls or injuries related to fa lls occurred in 4.6% of patients treat ed with XTA NDI 
compared to 1.3% of patients on placebo. Fa lls were not a ssociated with lo ss of consciousne ss or seizure. 
Fall-related inju ries were more severe in patients t reated with XTA NDI and included non-pathologic fracture s, 
joint inju ries, and hematoma s. 
 
Hallucinations  
 
In the ra ndomized c linical trial, 1.6% of patients tr eated with XTA NDI were r eported to hav e Grade 1 or 
2 ha llucinations compared to 0.3% of patients on placebo. Of the patients wi th hallucination s, the majority 
was on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-containing medications at the time of the event . Hallucinations were visual, tact ile, or undefined. 
 
Posterior Reversible encephalopa thy Sy ndrome (PR ES) 
 
Two po st marketing cases of confirmed PRES were identified from the global safety databa se (estimated 
cumulative po st marketing exposure of 17,704 patient treatm ent y ears as of 30Au gust2014). In the fir st case, 
reported symptoms (confusional sy ndrome and aphasia; symptom onset on treatment day 27). The patient 
received acute tr eatment with intraveno us corticosteroid s. After di scontinuing enzalutamide, reported 
symptoms resolved and a follow- up c erebral MRI reveale d regre ssion of a bnorma lities, indicative of positive 
de-cha llenge. In t he second case, reported symptoms (altered mental status, confusion, and word-fi nding 
difficultie s; with a blood pre ssure of 188/97 mm Hg; symptom onset on tr eatment day 98) and MRI findings 
were consistent with a di agnosis of PRES. The patient was treated with dexamethasone and a n 
antihypertensive regimen of h ydralazine and carvedilol. A fter disco ntinuing enzalutamide , reported symptoms 
resolved and fo llow-up cerebral MRI fi nding showed si gnificant improvemen t, indicative of positive de-cha llenge. 
Disconti nuation of enzalutamide in patients who develo p PRES is recomm ended. Patients should be informed 
to conta ct the st udy physician as soon as possible if t hey experien ce rapi[INVESTIGATOR_250894], headache, and c onfusion, reduced eyesight, or blurred visio n.

6.2 Paclitaxel (T axol®) 
 
Contraindications 
 
Taxol is contrai ndicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity r eactions to Taxo l or other 
drugs formulated in Cremo phor® EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil ). 
Taxol should not be used in pati ents with so lid tumors who have base line neutro phil counts of 
<1500 ce lls/mm3 or in patients with AIDS-related Kapos i’s sarcoma with base line neutro phil counts 
of <1000 ce lls/mm 3. 
However for the purposes of this trial, once patients have begun active treatment,  patients must 
maintain an Absolute Neutrophil Count > 1,000 cells/mm3. 
 
Warni ngs 
 
Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characte rized by [CONTACT_250912], angioedema, and genera lized urticaria ha ve occurred in 2 to 4% of patien ts 
receiving Taxol in c linical trial s. Fatal r eactions have o ccurred in patients despi[INVESTIGATOR_250896] . All 
patients should be pretr eated with corticosteroid s, diphe nhydramine, and H2 antago nists  
Patients who experien ce severe hypersensitivity r eactions to Taxol should not be recha llenged with 
the drug. 
 
Bone
 marrow s uppression (primarily neutr openia)  
 
Dose-depe ndent and is the dose- limiting toxicity. Neutrophil nadirs o ccurred at a median of 11 days. 
Taxol should not be administered to patients with base line neutrophil counts of le ss th an 1,500 
cells/mm3 (<1000 ce lls/mm3 for patients with KS). Fre quent monitoring of bl ood count s should be 
instituted during Taxol tr eatment. Patients should not be re-treated with s ubsequent cycles of Taxol 
until neutr ophils recover to a level > 1,000 cells/mm3 (>100 0 cells/mm3 for patien ts with KS) and 
platelets recover to a level > 100,000 ce lls/mm 3. 
Severe co nduction abnorma lit ies have b een documented in <1% of patients during Taxol therap y 
and in some cases re quiring pacemaker placement. If patients develop si gnificant co nducti on 
abnorma lities during Taxol infusion, a ppropriate therapy should be administered and conti nuous 
cardiac monitoring should be performed during subse quent therapy with Taxol. 
 
Pregnancy  
 
Taxol can cau se fetal harm when administered to a pre gnant woman. Administration of pac litaxe l 
during the period of organogenesis to ra bbits at doses of 3.0 mg/kg/day (about 0.2 the da ily 
maximum recommended human do se on an mg/m2 basi s) caused embryo- and fetotoxicity, as 
indicated by [CONTACT_250913], incr eased resorption s, and incr eased fetal d eaths. Materna l

 toxicity was al so observed at this dose. No teratogenic e ffects were observed at 1.0 mg/kg/da y 
(about 1/15 the da ily maximu m recomm ended human do se on an mg/m2 basis); teratogeni c 
potential could not be a ssessed at hi gher doses due to extensive fetal morta lity. 
There are no ade quate and well-controlled st udies in pre gnant women. If Taxol is used during 
pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregn ant while receiving this drug, the patient should b e apprised 
of the potential hazard to the fetu s. Women of childb earing pot ential should be advis ed to avoid 
becoming pre gnant. 
 
Precauti ons 
 
Conta ct of the und iluted concentrate with plasticized pol yvinyl chloride ( PVC) equipment o r devices 
used to prepare sol utions for infusion is not recomme nded. In order to minimize patien t exposure to 
the plasticizer DEHP [di-(2-ethyl hexyl)phthalate], whi ch may be leac hed from PVC infusion bags or 
sets, diluted Taxol solutions should preferably be stored in bo ttles (gla ss, polypropylene) or plastic 
bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and adm inistered through polyethylene- lined administration set s. 
Taxol should be administered through an in- line filter with a microporou s membrane not greater than 
0.22 micron s. Use of filter devices su ch as IVEX-2® f ilters whi ch incorporate short inlet and outlet 
PVC-coated t ubing has not resulted in significant l eaching o f DEHP. IV EX-2® is the registered 
trademark of the M illipore Cor poration. 
 
Drug Inter actions 
 
In a Pha se 1 trial using e scalating doses of Taxol ( 110–200 mg/m2) and cisplatin (50 or 7 5 mg/m2) 
given as se quential infusion s, myelos uppression was more profo und when Taxol w as given after 
cisplatin than with the alternate se quence (i.e. Taxol before cisplatin). P harmacokineti c data from 
these patients demonstrated a decr ease  in pac litaxel clearan ce of approximately 33% when Taxo l 
was administered fo llowing cisplatin. 
 
The metabo lism of Taxol is catalyzed by [CONTACT_9058] P450 is oenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 . 
Caution should be exercised when Taxol is concomitantly administered with known s ubstrate s 
(e.g., midazolam, buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331], felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lovastatin, eletriptan, sildenaf il, simvastatin, an d triazolam), 
inhibitors (e .g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, i ndinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazol e, nefazodone, 
nelfinavir, rito navir, saquinavir, and telithromycin), and inducers (e .g.,  rifampin and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) 
of CYP3A4. Caution should al so be exercised when Taxol is concomitantly administered with known 
substrates (e .g., repag linide and rosig litazone), i nhibitors (e .g., gemfibroz il), and inducers (e .g., 
rifampin) of CY P2C8. Potential interactions betw een Taxol, a substrate of CYP3A4, and protea se 
inhibitors (ritonavir, saquinavir, i ndinavir, and nelfi navir), which are s ubstrates a nd/or inhibitors of 
CYP3A4, have not b een evaluated in c linical trial s. R
eports in the literature sugge st that plasma 
levels of doxor ubicin (and its active metabo lite doxor ubicinol) may be incr eased when pac litaxel 
and doxorubicin are used in combination. 
 
 
Hematology  
 
Taxol therapy should not be administered to patients with base line neutr ophil co unts of le ss th an 
1500 ce lls/mm3. In order to monitor the o ccurrence of myelotoxicity, it is recommended tha t frequent 
peripheral bl ood cell counts be performed on all patients receiving Taxol. Patients shoul d not be re-
treated with s ubsequent cycles of Taxol until neutro phils recover to a leve l >1,000 cells/mm3 and 
platelets recover to a level >100,000 ce lls /mm3. In the ca se of severe neutropeni a (<500 ce lls/mm3 
for 7 days or more) during a cour se of Taxol therapy, a 20% reduction in do se for subsequent 
courses of therapy is recomme nded. 
For patients with advanced HIV dis ease and p oor-risk AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, Taxol, a t the 
recomme nded do se for this dis ease, can be initiated and rep eated if the neutro phil count is at least 
1000 cells/mm 3.

 Hypersensitivity R eactions  
 
Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to pro ducts containing Crem ophor® E L 
(e.g., cyclospori ne for injection concentrate and teniposide for injection concentrate) should not be 
treated with Taxol. In order to avoid the o ccurrence of severe hypersensitivity reaction s, all patients 
treated with Taxol should be premedicated with corticosteroids (su ch as dexamethasone), 
diphe nhydramine and H2 antagonists (s uch as cimetidine or ranitidine). Mino r symptoms such as 
flushing, ski
n reaction s, dyspnea , hypotension, or tachycardia do not re quire inte rruption of therapy. 
However, severe reaction s, such as hypotension re quiring tr eatmen t, dyspnea re quiring 
bronch odilators, angioedema, or generalized urticaria re quire immediat e discontinuation of Taxol 
and aggre ssive symptomatic therapy. Patients who have develope d severe hypersensitivity 
reactions should not be recha llenge d with Taxol.

Hypotension, bradycardia, and hypertension have b een observed during administration of Taxol , but 
generally do not re quire treatment. O ccasionally Taxol infusions mu st be inte rrupted o r discontinued 
becau se of initial or recurrent hypertension. Fre quent vital sign monitori ng, particularly during the 
first hour of Taxol infusion, is recomme nded. Continuous cardi ac monitoring is not r equired except 
for patients with serio us co nduction a bno rmalities. When Taxo l is used in combination with 
doxor ubicin for treatment of metastatic br east cancer, monitoring of cardiac f unction is 
recomm ended. 
 
Nerv ous System  
 
Although the o ccurrence of pe ripheral neuropathy is fre quent, the development of sever e 
symptomatology is unusual and re quires a do se reduction of 20% for all s ubse quent courses of 
Taxol. Taxol contains dehydrated alcohol U SP, 396 mg/mL; consi deration should be given t o 
possible CNS and other e ffects of alcohol.  
 
 Hepat ic 
There is limited eviden ce that the myelotoxicity of Taxo l may be exacerbated in patients wit h serum 
total b ilirubin >[ADDRESS_305143]. Extreme caution should be exercised when administering  Taxol to su ch 
patient s. 
 
Injection Site Reaction  
 
Injection site r eaction s, including r eactions seco ndary to extravasation, were usua lly mild and 
consisted of erythema, te nderne ss, skin di scoloration, or swe lling at the injection site. The se 
reactions ha ve been observed more fre quently with the 24-hour infusion than with the 3-ho ur 
infusion. Recurren ce of skin r eactions at a site of previous extravasation fo llowing administratio n of 
Taxol at a different site, i .e., “recall,” h as been reported. 
More severe events such as phlebiti s, cellu litis, induration, ski n exfoliation, necrosis, and fibrosi s have 
been reported. In some cases the onset of the injection site reaction either occurred durin g a 
prolo nged infusion or was delayed by a w eek to 10 day s. 
A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time. Given the possibility of 
extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for po ssible inf iltration during dru g 
administratio n. 
 
Carci nogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impa irment of Ferti lity 
 
The carcinogenic potential of Taxol (pac litaxel) has not been studied.

 lymphocyte s) and in vivo (micro nucleus test in mice). Paclitaxel was not mutagenic in the Am es 
test or the CHO/ HGPRT gene mutation a ssay. 
Administration of pac litaxel prior to and during mating produced impairment of fert ility in male a nd 
female rats at doses e qual to or gr eater than 1 mg/kg/day (about 0.04 the da ily maximum 
recomme nded human do se on a mg/m2 basis). At this dose, pac litaxel caused reduced fert ility and 
repro ductive indice s, and increased embryo- and fetotoxicity. 
 
Pregnancy  
 
Pregnancy (Section 9.2.2). Should a participant, or participant’s partner, become pregnant while on study, 
refer to section 9.2.2 for IRB and sponsor notification.  
 
7.0 Therapy Administration  and Do se Re ductions: 
NOTE: All toxicities s hould be graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criter ia (version 
4.0) 
Dose modification for pac litaxel due to drug interaction to enzalutamide is not necessary base d on 
the pha se I trial, combination therapy of enzalutamide and docetaxe l in CRPCa patient s. (
Data not 
shown) AEs leading to do se reduction of enzalutamide in the two combined contro lled population of 
CRPCa patients were infre quent (enzalutamide 2.1% vs placebo 1.5%). Do se adjustm ents of 
paclitaxel should be considered f irst with the e xcept ion of  nervous syste m disorder s, e.g., seizure, 
PRES, syncope. If the AEs persist after do se reduction of pac litaxel, do se reduction of 
enzalutamide should be considered. Treating physician should consult with PI [INVESTIGATOR_250897], or both, drugs.  Dose modification sche dule was s hown in Table 3. 
 In the c a se of nervous system toxicit y, the trial tr eatment w ill be di sconti nued. 
 
Enzalutamide and pac litaxel will be wit hheld for dr ug-related ≥ Grade 3 hematologic toxiciti es 
(excluding Grade 3 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia), or Grade 3 or higher non- 
hematological toxicity, incl uding laboratory a bnorma lities, and severe or life-threat ening AEs as per 
Table 2 below. After tho se toxicities resol ve to Grade 0-1 or base line, tr eatment could be resumed 
with one level of do se reduction. 
   
Should a delay of >14 days be re quired, then the patient should be di scontinued fro m study 
treatmen t.

9.1   Definition of Adverse Events (AE s) 
 
An adver se event ( AE) is defined as any untoward medical o ccurrence in a s ubject administere d 
a study drug and whi ch does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this tr eatment. A n 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laborator y 
finding), symptom, or dis ease  tempora lly associated with the u se of a st udy dr ug, whether or n ot 
related to the st udy drug. 
 
An abnorma lity identified during a medical te st (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital si gn, ECG data , 
physica l exam) should be defined as an AE only if the a bnorma lity meets one of the followi ng 
criteria: 
• Induces c linical si gns or symptoms. 
• Requires acti ve interventio n. 
• Requires inte rruption or di sconti nuation of st udy medicatio n. 
• The a bnorma lity or investigationa l value is c linically si gnificant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8598] e 
investigator. 
 
All adver se event s, whether or not relat ed to the st udy drug, must be docum ented in the electronic  
database. 
 
 
9.2   Definition of Seri ous Adverse Events (SAE s) 
 
An AE is considered “seriou s” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in an y 
of the following outcome s: 
 
• Results in deat h, 
• Is life thr eatening (an AE is considered “ life-thr eateni ng” if, in the view of either t he 
investigator or sponsor, its o ccurren ce places the subje ct at immediate ri sk of d eath. It 
does not incl ude an AE that, had it o ccurred in a more severe form, might have cause d 
death.), 
• Results in persistent or significant disab ility/incapacity or s ubstantial disruption of th e 
ability to condu ct normal life function s, 
• Results in co ngenital anomaly, or birth defect, 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250898] l eads to prolo ngation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916]

Follow-up information for the event should be sent within promptly (within 7 days) as nece ssary. 
 
Repo rt to M D A nderson I RB 
 
All events o ccurring during the c onduct of a protocol and m eeting the definition of a SAE mu st be 
reported to the IRB in a ccordan ce with the timeframes and procedures out lined in “University of 
[LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review B oard Po licy on Reporting Seriou s 
Adver se Events”. Unle ss stated otherwi se in the protocol, all SAEs,  expected or u nexpecte d, 
must be reported to ORERM, regardle ss of a ttribution ( within 5 working days of k nowledge of th e

the study drug, mu st have a w ritten report submi tted within 24 hours (next working day) of 
knowle dge of the event to the Safety Proje ct Manager in ORERM. The MDACC “Internal SAE 
Report For m for Prompt Reporting” w ill be used for reporting to ORERM. Serious adver se even ts 
will be capt ured from the time the patient signs consent until [ADDRESS_305148] of enzalutamide in pre gnant and lactating women is not known, and the exposure of a 
fetus or nursing infant is considered a potential ri sk. Enzalutamide can cau se fetal harm wh en

Overview 
This is a non-ra ndomized open label phase IIB study. Co unting pCR ( RCB-0) or RCB-I as 
response, using a Simon optima l two-stage design with al pha = beta = 10%,  and then setting th e 
threshold for an a cceptable pCR or RCB-I rate at 20 %. We will enroll [ADDRESS_305150] 4 of th e 
37 patients with pCR or RCB-I. This design has a 54% probab ility of early termination after th e 
first stage if the true pCR or RCB-I probab ility is 5 %. 
 
Patients who are unable to complete the combination therapy due to toxicity will be considere d 
non- respo nders. Patients wit hdrawing early for any reasons other than (1) toxicity or (2) for 
progre ssion of dis ease wil l be replaced. A dditiona lly, a seco ndary efficacy analysis will be based 
on a modified intent-to-tr eat population receiving at l east one do se of experimental therapy such 
that patients wit hdrawing early for any r eason ar e considered non-respo nders. We will require 
37 p
atients enro lled in order to ensure a sufficient number of evaluable patients at the final 
protoco l analysi s. 
 
 
Seco ndary Objectiv es and Correlati ve Studie s: 
Potential biomarkers of respon se will be correlated with pathologic respon se to this tr eatmen t 
using appropriate statistical analyses for the biomarker of interest. 
 
A seco ndary objective of this st udy is to al so estimate the PFS distribution. PFS is defined as th e 
time from enro llment to progre ssion of dis ease  (>30% increa se in tumor si ze as defined i n 
Section 8.2) or d eath whichever comes firs t. 
 
We w ill estimate the proportion of patients with pCR ( RCB-0) or RCB-I as the res ponse  rate alon g 
with an a ppropriate 95% confiden ce interval. We w ill estimate the proportion of patients in th e 
remaining RCB categories with confiden ce intervals as we ll. We w ill estimate the PFS distri bution 
using the Kaplan-Meier method from the date of enrollment onto this st udy until the date o f 
progression or d eath without eviden ce of progre ssi on. Patients a live and disease-free at the late st 
clinical evaluation w ill be censored at the date of that evaluatio n. 
 
Early drop outs (i.e., patients not ge tting to surgery) should be counted as tr eatm ent fa ilures (i.e. , 
non-respo nders with RCB > 1). 
If no RCB-[ADDRESS_305151] udy will be ava ilable to all e ligible patients regardle ss of race, or et hnic origin. T here is no

STATISTICS
Primary Analysis PlanWe will rely heavily on RNA-seq analysis, in some cases 
complemented with DNA sequencing and protein assessments. The 
RNAseq data will be normalized and compared in diseased vs normal 
skin and differential expression discerned at a significance level of 5% 
in a single test, in a two-group comparison, using a Negative Binomial 
mode. Numerous qualitative analyses will be performed as well.
Rationale for Number 
of SubjectsBulk RNA-seq studies have required ~[ADDRESS_294118] of the molecular profiling will start with 
an initially smaller # of patients.

significant minority of patients do not adequately respond to these medications. Given the 
multiple medication options that target different inflammatory pathways, significant 
expense and serious side effects of these immunomodulatory medications, it is imperative 
that we develop mechanisms to better predict whether a patient will respond to a given 
drug.  
1.1 . Overview of Non-Clinical Studies
1.1 We will be collecting skin tissue from psoriatic patients for the purposes of 
analyzing gene activity in these samples.
1.2 Overview of Clinical Studies
Patient will be assessed for improvement in their psoriasis using the Psoriasis Area and 
Severity Index (PASI) score.  Patients will be administered tildrakizumab (a FDA-
approved medication for psoriasis) following manufacturer’s and FDA indications and 
dosing schedule.
[ADDRESS_294120] whether a person with psoriasis will respond 
to a given medication. In this study, patient will start tildrakizumab (a FDA-approved 
medication for psoriasis). Prior to treatment, a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_242417]-affected skin will 
be sampled and molecularly profiled. We will then analyze the molecular profiles and 
compare to patient tildrakizumab treatment response to predict which future patients will 
best respond to this medication.
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment
Regarding the tildrakizumab treatment, this is a FDA approved medication for psoriasis.  
The same risks/benefits assessment for a psoriatic patient in our clinics as to whether to 
start this medication apply.
Regarding the skin biopsy, there is minimal risk to patients as punch biopsies are standard 
dermatologic procedures that are performed frequently with minimal side effects, which 
include bleeding, pain, infection, scar, changes in skin coloration, and allergic reaction to 
anesthesia. Knowledge may be gained about health conditions and patient may derive a 
feeling of contribution to knowledge in the health field
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES
3.1 Primary Objective
Our primary objective is to identify the genes that are differentially expressed in psoriatic 
skin between patients that do and do not respond to tildrakizumab
Jeffrey ChengConfidential

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 3.2 Secondary Objectives
There is no secondary objective.
4 STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Study Overview
This is a single center study in which patients with psoriasis or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_242418]/or normal tissue prior to treatment with the FDA-
approved psoriasis medication, tildrakizumab.
5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION
5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint
We will evaluate if there are genes which are statistically significantly upregulated or 
downregulated in specific cell populations, based on RNA sequencing.
For assessment of psoriasis improvement, we will use the Psoriasis Area and Severity 
Index (PASI) scoring system.
5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
There are no secondary endpoints.
5.3 Safety Evaluations
The biopsy site will be evaluated at time of suture removal for any signs of superficial 
infection.
Patients will have standard follow-up visits to assess efficacy and side effects of 
tildrakizumab, as would any of our non-trial patients started on this medication.

10 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
10.1 Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment.  
AE Severity
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be 
Jeffrey ChengConfidential
Version #: Version Date: Page 14 of 23
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown in Table 1 below should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed 
out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily 
serious.
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading
Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description
Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.
Moderate (2) Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].
Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.
AE Relationship to Study Drug
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the 
guidelines in Table 2.
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug
Relationship
to DrugComment
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_41833]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846].
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_41847].
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.
Unrelated An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug.
10.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:
Jeffrey ChengConfidential
Version #: Version Date: Page 15 of 23
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 death
a life-threatening adverse experience
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
a persistent or significant disability/incapacity
a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed. 
10.2.1 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per 
UCSF CHR Guidelines.  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.
In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site investigator will report 
SAEs to the IRB/IEC.

endpoint criteria.  Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria
Use of a prohibited concomitant medication
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a 
protocol violation. The investigator Jeffrey Cheng will determine if a protocol violation 
will result in withdrawal of a subject.
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol 
Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by a 
Sponsor representative and the Investigator. A copy of the form will be filed in the site’s 
regulatory binder and in the Sponsor’s files.

15.1 Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to the protocol will be written by [CONTACT_1034].  Protocol amendments 
cannot be implemented without prior written IRB/IEC approval except as necessary to 
eliminate immediate safety hazards to patients.  A protocol amendment intended to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be implemented immediately, 
provided the IRBs are notified within five working days.
15.2 Institutional Review Boards and Independent 
Ethics Committees
The protocol and consent form will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC of each 
participating center prior to study initiation.  Serious adverse experiences regardless of 
causality will be reported to the IRB/IEC in accordance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC, and the Investigator will keep the IRB/IEC 
informed as to the progress of the study.  The Investigator will obtain assurance of 
IRB/IEC compliance with regulations.
Any documents that the IRB/IEC may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, 
protocol amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning 
patient recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) 
will be submitted to the IRB/IEC.  The IRB/IECs written unconditional approval of the 
study protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator 
before the study is initiated.  The IRB/IECs unconditional approval statement will be 
transmitted by [CONTACT_242429].  This approval must refer to the study by [CONTACT_242430].
Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may not be initiated without 
prior written IRB/IEC approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to 
the patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
study.  Such modifications will be submitted to the IRB/IEC and written verification that 
the modification was submitted and subsequently approved should be obtained.  
The IRB/IEC must be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for 
review; serious and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the study in

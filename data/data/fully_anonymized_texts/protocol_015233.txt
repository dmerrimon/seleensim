neutrophils [ CANs ], serum CD62L, high sensitivity C -reactive 
protein [ hsCRP ], the gut permeability biomarker s intestinal fatty -
acid binding protein [ iFABP ], lipopolysacch aride [LPS] , and the 
gut bacteria biomarker urine 3 -indoxyl sulfate [3 -IS Urine]) will 
be collected at the following timepoints:  
• Day 1: pre-dose 
• Day 8, Day 15, and Day 29: during each visit – pre dose  
• Day 31 
• Day 43 
• During medical facility visit for VOC, when possible. 
Safety :  
Safety will be assessed throughout the duration of the study by 
[CONTACT_251180] (AE s), vital signs  (systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, oral body temperature, and oxygen saturation) , clinical safety laboratory tests (hematology, 
chemistry, urinalysis , and C -reactive protein ), physical exams 
(PEs), and electrocardiograms (ECGs).   
Exploratory Assessments:  
At every study visit, subjects will report, and the site staff will 
record,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_624840].   
Information on any potential VOCs experienced during the study will be collected as follows :

o The occurrence of appropriate symptoms consistent 
with a painful crisis, acute chest syndrome (ACS), or priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], and  
o Requires visit to a medical facility , and 
o Receipt of either a parenteral or oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_624839] . 
• Categorization of VOCs . Subcategories are uncomplicated 
pain crise s, acute chest syndrome (ACS), hepatic 
sequestration , splenic sequestration, and priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801] (requiring 
healthcare visit) .  
• Intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_83269] (IOA) and oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_624841], including date/time of each start and stop of treatment, 
dose, drug, inpatient/outpatient setting, and date/time of 
readiness- to-discharge.  
SAMPLE SIZE  The total of [ADDRESS_832504] s is not based on formal statistic al 
considerations . Twelve (12) subject s per arm  receiving active 
rifaximin is considered adequate to evaluate the PK/PD of 
rifaximin  ER and DER . 
STATISTICAL 
METHODOLOGY  Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics : 
PK will be ev aluated by [CONTACT_624872] [ADDRESS_832505], 
and MR_AUC 0-8h will be  estimated . 
Following the final dose on Day 29, Cmax, Tmax, Cmin, Cavg, 
AUC 0-8h,  CL/Fss, Vz/Fss, R Cmax, R AUC, AUC last, AUC inf, λz, 
t1/2, and MR_ AUC 0-8h will be estimated .  
Additional PK  parameters maybe calculated if it deemed 
necessary.  
The placebo arms will be combined for all descriptive summaries 
of subject disposition, demography and Baseline characteristics, PD, VOCs, and safety. 
ANC , CANs  (count and % neutrophils) , and s erum CD62L levels 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_624873]2161; Version 6 .0, 12 April  2022   Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 13 of 77  Baseline (pre -dose at Day  1) at each visit  for which they are 
collected . 
iFABP , LPS,  hsCRP , and urine 3 -indoxyl sulfate levels will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_624874] (pre- dose at Day 1) at each visit.  
A dose-response analysis may be conducted to determine the 
relationship between daily rifaximin ER an d DER  dosing and 
reduction of CANs. Dose-response relationships following the 
final dose on  Day 29 may also be assessed for other PD 
endpoints, if warranted.  
The relationship between rifaximin PK parameters (C trough, Cmax,ss, 
Css,avg) and each PD endpoint (  ANC , CANs, serum CD62L levels , 
serum iFABP, serum  LPS , serum hsCRP , and urine 3-inoxyl 
sulfate) may be evaluated following the final dose on Day 29.  
Additionally, a population PK/PD model may be developed as a 
separate analysis to explore exposure- response.   If conducted, this 
analysis will be reported separately from the Clinical Study Report. 
Safety :  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified based on MedDRA terminology. Adverse events that occur after the start o f treatment (treatment- emergent adverse events 
[TEAEs]), will be summarized ; all AEs will be included in by-
subject listings .  
TEAEs will be summarized for the entire population, by [CONTACT_6490], and by [CONTACT_202856]. Eac h 
subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a 
preferred term by [CONTACT_624875], respectively, within each category. All SAEs, AEs leading to premature withdrawal from the study, and all deaths will be listed.  
Vital signs will be summarized at Baseline and for each visit. Changes from Baseline in vital sign measurements will also be summarized.  
Clinical safety laboratory data will be summarized at Baseline, at 
each visit, and  as changes from Baseline in laboratory parameters. 
Abnormal findings in ECGs and physical examinations will be summarized and listed.  
Data permitting, the number and duration of VOCs ( overall and by 
[CONTACT_624876]) and SCD- associated medical facility visits that do 
Protocol RBSC2161; Version [ADDRESS_832506] listings  will include the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], route 
of administration, dose, and duration of treatment . Summaries will 
include descriptive statistics for oral and intravenous use, as well as morphine milligram equivalents ( MME ).

1.1 Disease Background  
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a related group of common and rare hemoglobin (Hb) genotypes in 
which all affected individuals are either homozygotes for the sickle Hb (HbS) mutation of the β-globin subunit or compound heterozygotes for HbS and another globin gene mutation 
[Steinberg  2012] . The various forms of SCD are based on inheritance patterns from an individual’s 
parents. The most common type of SCD, HbSS features two sickle cell genes (“S”); one “S” gene is inherited fr om each parent. HbSS genotype presents as sickle cell anemia (SCA) and is the most 
severe form of SCD. Another common yet milder type of SCD is HbSC. A single sickle cell gene (“S”) is inherited from one parent, and an abnormal Hb gene “C” is inherited from the other parent. A third type of SCD is HbS β- thalassemia. In this genotype, a single sickle cell gene (“S”) is 
inherited from one parent and another gene for β- thalassemia is inherited from the other parent. 
HbS β -thalassemia can be further divided int o two subtypes: subtype HbS β0- thalassemia, which 
is a more severe form of SCD, and subtype HbS β+- thalassemia, which is a milder form of SCD. 
Individuals with the sickle cell trait (HbAS) generally do not exhibit signs and symptoms of SCD. In this genotype, a single sickle cell gene is inherited from one parent. However, a normal gene “A” is inherited from the other parent. Nevertheless, there is the risk of passing the sickle cell gene to offspring [ CDC 20 20; da Guarda 2020; Steinberg 2012]. 
Hb in SCD has the physical tendency for polymerization in deoxygenated conditions.  Among the 
many changes that result from the damage to the sickle RBC (SS -RBC) membrane is the 
propensity to adhere to the vascular endothelium.  SS-RBCs and activated endothelial cells can 
produce a proinflammatory environment that is exacerbated during epi[INVESTIGATOR_565164]-occlusive crisis (VOC) [Manwani 2013] . SS -RBCs are rigid and do not easily flow through the 
microcirculation; they exhibit changes in solubility and molecular stability and can obstruct the vasculature, resulting in the clinical manifestations of SCD [Darba ri 2020].  
A hallmark symptom of SCD is a painful VOC. An interplay of the various pathologic processes in SCD perpetuates and feeds forward an inflammatory priming that, in the presence of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_124372], can lead to a VOC. Precipi[INVESTIGATOR_624842] a VOC may include hypoxia, infection, dehydration, acidosis, alcohol intoxication, emotional stress, pregnancy, and cold weather (vasospasm).  A VOC is initiated and sustained by [CONTACT_624878], endothelial cells , and plasma constituents. The re is a cytokine mediated exchange implicated in 
the development of a VOC between sickled erythrocytes, aged and activated neutrophils, inflammatory messenger molecules, monocytes, platelets, and endothelium. Activated neutrophils play a pi[INVESTIGATOR_624843] a VOC and act as central elements during the crisis. Higher neutrophil counts correlate with more severe disease manifestation, including earlier death, increased incidence of silent brain infarcts, hemorrhagic stroke, and acute chest syndrome (AC S) 
[Darbari 2020, Lim 2016] .  
VOC s are responsible for a wide variety of clinical complications of SCD, including pain 
syndromes, acute chest syndrome ( ACS ), stroke, priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], leg ulcers, spontaneous abortion, renal 
Protocol RBSC2161; Version [ADDRESS_832514] the natural course of the disease. During a VOC, 
patients present with acute severe pain that is often described as throbbing and sharp. Common sites of pain include the lower back, joints, and extremities [ Darbari 2020, Yale 2000].  
1.[ADDRESS_832515] identified various cellular and molecular factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of SCD. These include the complex interaction between erythrocytes, platelets, vascular endothelial surface molecules, and neutrophils. Both activated and aged neutrophils may be immobilized on vascular endothelium and form the nidus for sickled erythrocytes to adhere, eliciting a VOC [Zhang 2016, Lim 2019]. 
Circulating aged neutrophils (CANs), a subset of neutrophils with high surface expression of CXCR4 and low CD62L (L -selectin), may be significantly elevated during a VOC. CD62L is shed 
on neutrophil activation and acts as a sensitive marker. The expression of CD62L on neutrophils decreases in patients with SCD experiencing a VOC [Lard 1999] .  
In several scientific experiments, Zhang , et. al. demonstrated a relationship between the 
microbiome and neutrophil aging/activation. Treatment of mice with broad- spectrum antibiotics 
(ABX) led to a highly efficient depletion and dramatic alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota. Microbiota depletion resulted in significant and selective reductions of neutrophil numbers in the circulation. Both the percentages and numbers of aged neutrophils were significantly reduced in ABX -treated mice. To assess the role of neutrophil aging in an applicable  
model, genetically engineered mice with SCD were studied. SCD mice exhibited expansion of all 
major white blood cell subsets compared with healthy control mice. ABX -mediated microbiota 
depletion led to a significant and specific decrease of neutrophils, but not the other leukocyte populations. Importantly, in mice with SCD, aged neutrophils populations were increased by > 10-fold, and their expansion was completely negated by [CONTACT_624879] [Zhang 2015]. 
Therefore, modul ating intestinal microbial composition may be a therapeutic option in SCD to 
reduce VOC by [CONTACT_624880].  
Lim, et. al. hypothesized that an intestinal dysbiosis is associated with VOC epi[INVESTIGATOR_624844]. Abnorm alities in the integrity of the intestinal wall/mucosa, a chronic dysbiosis of the 
intestinal flora, or both are likely to occur in patients with SCD. The intestinal mucosa and the ability of the gut wall to support a normal microbiome in patients with SCD  are impaired, due to 
periodic or global low -grade intestinal ischemia that occurs as a result of VOC s in the splanchnic 
vasculature. The compromised intestinal barrier renders patients with SCD more susceptible to recurrent translocation of intestinal bacteria into the submucosa and bloodstream. Although the bacterial inocula are not numerous enough to cause overt infections, they can activate an immune response [ Lim 2016, Lim 2018] .  
Protocol RBSC2161; Version [ADDRESS_832516] been observed in the intestines of patients 
with SCD, including enterocyte injury, altered microbial composition, increased permeability, and 
bacterial overgrowth. Dutta , et. al. measured serum intestinal fatty -acid binding protein (iFABP) 
and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) levels in patients with SCD. Both iFABP and LPS are markers for intestinal injury and impaired bowel wall integrity (“leaky gut”).  Levels were then compared to 
patients with iron deficiency anemia,  but without SCD. Individuals with SCD had significantly 
higher iFABP (P = 0.04) and LPS (P = 0.03), indicating intestinal injury and increased intestinal bacterial translocation into the systemic circulation. In addition, serum soluble CD62L (P = 0.04) 
was elevated, and soluble CD62L correlated positively with CANs (R = 0.7, P = 0.03) and LPS (R 
= 0.66, P = 0.027).  These results provide evidence of the presence of intestinal compromise and 
increased gut permeability in patients who have SCD [Dutta 2019] .  It has been demonstrated that 
rifaximin modulation of ileal microbiome communities prevents impairment of intestinal barrier function induced by [CONTACT_35234]. [ Xu 2014].  
Lim, et al, also hypothes ized that rifaximin is an ideal antimicrobial agent for gut decontamination 
in patients with SCD and will reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624845] a reduction of CANs. In August 2019, Lim et al com pleted a 
single- arm, open-label study of 13 adult patients with SCD (HbSS, HbSC, HbS β- thalassemia), 
administered rifaximin 550 mg BID for 6 months ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The primary objective of the study was to determine the feasibility and toxicity profile of l ong-term rifaximin in patients with 
SCD  [Dutta 2020, Lim 2019].  
Results from the Phase 2 study demonstrated that treatment with rifaximin significantly reduced 
the frequency of painful VOCs and the  number of days patients needed IOA compared with the 
prior 12 months when patients were not on rifaximin therapy. In the 12 patients evaluated, t here 
was a mean decrease from the expected 2.25 VOC s (range 1 –6.5) per 6 months to 1 VOC per 6 
months (range 0–4) in patients receiving rifaximin (P = 0.003). There was also a significant decrease with rifaximin in days needing IOA over the 6- month study period (median 9 days; range 
1–55; P = 0.008). Furthermore, the total number of days that patients with SCD required IOA was reduced from the expected 254 days over 6 months  to 98 days during the 6- month rifaximin 
treatment period.  
Serum CD62L was serially measured and found to be elevated in 9 patients at baseline, but then 
consistently declined to levels observed in non- SCD controls (P < 0.001). In addition, most (75%) 
patients exhibited > 10% CANs in their venous blood before starting rifaximin (median 12.6; range 6–40) and levels of CANs dropped signific antly in all patients after starting rifaximin to below 5% 
(P = 0.005). Drops in CANs occurred as early as 2 weeks after initiation of rifaximin and remained low throughout the 6- month study period.  Likewise, baseline serum iFABP was elevated in all 
patie nts and decreased significantly (P = 0.008) with rifaximin in all patients to levels comparable 
with non-SCD controls.  
Overall, rifaximin was well tolerated. Mild nausea was common in the first 1 –2 weeks of therapy 
and occurred in 8 patients. Other advers e events included self -limiting diarrhea (n = 1), which 
Protocol RBSC2161; Version [ADDRESS_832517] month of therapy and polydipsia (n = 2). No epi[INVESTIGATOR_624846]. Laboratory analyses did not show any significant change in Hb, 
white cell  counts, serum lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, or haptoglobin due to rifaximin therapy 
[Lim 2019] .  This was the first study in humans showing the potential efficacy of microbial 
modulation on VOCs in patients with SCD and forms the basis for further investigation.  
Rifaximin extended release ( ER) and delayed extended release ( DER ) Cap sules  are new 
pharmaceutical formulations designed to have better dissolution properties within the lumen of the 
gut to target different areas of  the GI tract.  The ER Capsule is  a controlled release solid oral dosage 
form designed to target delivery of rifaximin to the upper GI tract, and the DER Capsule is  a 
controlled release solid oral dosage form designed to target delivery of rifaximin to the  mid-GI 
tract.  
The current  study is designed to evaluate the PK of ER and DER  Capsules  and to assess the 
response to treatment of  PD markers associated with VOCs including ANC , CANs, serum CD62L, 
hsCRP, the gut permeability biomarker s iFABP  and LPS, and the gut bacteria biomarker urine

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 28 of 77  3.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Overview of Study Design 
Study RBSC 2161 is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multicente r study 
to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) , pharmacodynamics (PD) safety and tolerability of 
rifaximin  ER and DER  in subjects with  SCD .  Exploratory assessments of the effect of rifaximin 
ER and DER  on the incidence of VOCs will also be explored.   
Approximately 60 s ubjects who successfully complete the Screening Period will enter the 
Treatment Period and will be ran domized to one of six treatment groups.  Approximately 20  study 
centers are expected to participate in the study.    
Objectives and endpoints for the study are provided in Section 2 .  Assessments of PK/PD  and 
safet y, and documentation of VOCs  (Appendix 1 and Section 7.3) will be performed during clinic 
visits at Baseline (Day 1 ), Day 8, Day 15, and Day 29 (End of Treatment/Early Termination) .  All 
subjects will also complete an End  of Study (EOS) Visit 2 weeks later (Day 43 ; End of Study) f or 
final assessments . Assessments will also be conducted when a subject visits a healthcare facility 
for treatment of a VOC.  If a subject prematurely discontinues treatment, every attempt will be 
made to obtain EOT and EOS assessments  and subjects should be followed until the end of the 
43-day trial. 
Before study subjects can be screened, the laboratory where the CANs as sessment will be 
performed  shall undergo a qualification run. This is to ensure that the flow cytometry assessment 
for CANs can be performed at the local site as outlined in the Laboratory Manual . The qualification 
run will be performed with blood from healthy, adult, non- pregnant, and capable volunteers of 
general good health (and non- sickle cell disease subjects).  Approximately 25 healthy volunteers 
(one per site, or per local lab ) is expected t o participate . Healthy volunteers will visit the study 
center once for this assessment  (single blood draw) and  it should take no more than 30 minutes to 
complete the testing.  
 
3.2 Treatment Assignment/Randomization 
Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria an d have given written informed consent will be 
randomized in a 2:2:1 :2:2:1 allocation to one of 6 treatment groups .  Approximately 12 subjects 
will be randomized to each active rifaximin treatment and approximately 6 subjects to each placebo 
group.  The treatment groups will be run in parallel.

applicable.  [IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination 
A full physical examination will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening).  Symptom -directed physical 
examinations will be performed at other visits .  Weight will be collected as outline d in Appendix 1.  
Height will only be collected at Visit 1 (Screening). 
6.3 Other Assessments  
6.3.1 Assessment of VOCs 
VOC s that subjects experience during the study will be collected.  A VOC is defined as :  
o The occurrence of appropriate symptoms consistent with a painful crisis, acute 
chest syndrome (ACS), or priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], and  
o Requires visit to a medical facility, and  
o Receipt of either a parenteral or oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_624847]. 
For each VOC , the information outlined in Section 7.[ADDRESS_832555]’s complete medical history is to be recorded i n source documents and the appropriate 
eCRF  pages.  Relevant m edical history will be collected for the [ADDRESS_832556]’ s VOCs over the past 12 months will be obtained and will 
include the start and stop dates (if known), the treatment setting, and treatment including drug, 
dose, route of administration , and duration of treatment for each VOC, when possible. 
Protocol RBSC2161; Version [ADDRESS_832557]’s signing of the informed 
consent according to the operating definitions defined in this section of the protocol.  The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events that meet the definition 
of an AE ( Section 7.1.1) , or SAE  (Section 7.1.2) . 
7.1.[ADDRESS_832558] a causal relationship 
with this  treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (that coul d include a clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study product, without any judgment about causality (i.e., whether or not considered related to the study product). 
An AE does incl ude the
  following: 
• Exacerbation or worsening of a pre -existing illness  including symptoms associated with 
SCD . 
• Condition detected or diagnosed after study product administration even though it may 
have been present prior to the start of the study. 
An AE does not include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion) as 
event terms; the condition that led to the procedure is the AE if it meets the definition of 
an AE.  
• Situations where an untoward medic al occurrence has not occurred (e.g.,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527807]; and social and/or convenience admissions).  
• Symptoms associated with disease, which are consistent with the subject’s usual clinical 
course; unless the subject experiences  worsening of their symptom(s) or the symptom(s) 
meet the criteria for an SAE  (exception is VOC  and presenting symptoms, Section 7.3). 
7.1.[ADDRESS_832559] medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death , 
Protocol RBSC2161; Version 6 .0, 12 April  2022   Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 51 of 77  • Is life -threatening. 
NOTE:  The term “l ife-threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject was , in the view of the Investigator or Sponsor, at risk of death at the 
time of the event .  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.    
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
NOTE: Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication 
prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from  
Baseline is not considered to be an AE.  “In-patient” hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624859] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624860] 24 hours or more.  It does not 
include presentation at a casualty or emergency room.  
• Results in a  persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of t he ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance su ch as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study 
product. 
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life -threatening, and/ or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.   
NOTE: Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Additionally, an adverse event meeting any of the serious outcomes previously defined above that is assessed by [CONTACT_624888] (regardless of relationship to 
study drug) should be treated as a n SAE for this protocol (e.g., complications resulting from the 
taking of a blood sample or performance of a protocol required procedure).   
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in case o f events that do not meet the serious criteria.  
Protocol RBSC2161; Version [ADDRESS_832560] 2 rifaximin doses will be recorded.  
7.2 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Oth er Abnormal Assessments as AEs 
and SAEs  
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other abnormal 
assessments (e.g., abnormal findings during examinations, the taking of vital signs,  or ECG 
monitoring) that are judged by [CONTACT_624889].  The Investigator should exercise his or her 
medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnorm al assessment (including ECG monitoring) is clinically significant.   Abnormal laboratory 
findings consistent with pre -existing illness  or confirmatory of a reported AE or SAE  should not 
be reported as a separate AE or SAE .  If a clinically significant chan ge from Baseline is observed 
which is indictive of worsening in condition, then the worsening condition should be reported as the AE or SAE . 
7.3 Adverse Events That Are VOC Endpoint Events  
VOC events that are listed in Table 3
 are being captured as endpoints and SHOULD NOT  be 
reported as an AE or SAE for purposes of this study.  These events will not be considered as 
SAEs for reporting requirements.  
 
Table 3:  VOC Events Not Requiring AE/SAE Reporting  
Uncompli cated pain crisis* 
Acute chest syndrome  
Hepatic sequestration  
Splenic sequestration 
Priapi[INVESTIGATOR_49341] a visit to a medical facility  
* Defined as the occurrence of appropriate symptoms, results  in a visit to a medical facility  and or 
healthcare professional and requires either parenteral  or oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_624847] , but is NOT 
classified as an acute chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, splenic sequestration, or  priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801].  
 
All VOCs are to be recorded only once on the “Vaso- Occlusive Event” eCRF  page. All VOCs are 
to be recorded throughout the entire treatment period, up to Visit 5 (Day 29), and should continue 
until the Fol low-Up Visit at Day 43.  The Investigator will classify and provide all the following 
information for each VOC as follows: 
• Diagnosis, which will be limited to one of the five pre-defined VOC events as:  
o Uncomplicated pain cris is 
o ACS  
Protocol RBSC2161; Version 6 .0, 12 April  2022   Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 53 of 77  o Hepatic sequestration  
o Splenic sequestration  
o Priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801] (requiring a visit to a medical facility)  
• Onset date,  
• Stop date, 
• Action taken (None, Required concomitant medication, Temporarily withheld study drug, 
Permanent discontinuation of study drug, or Other [explain]), 
• Treatment setting , 
• Concomitant medications given, and 
• Outcome (Recovered without sequelae, Resolved with sequelae, Ongoing, Unknown, 
Death).  
If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58176] a VOC and during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624861] a non- VOC event 
that meets the criteria for a SAE , then that event should be reported as a SAE. Any prolongation 
of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54692] a non- VOC event (even though they may have initially been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624862] a VOC) is reportable as a SAE in the eCRF . 
7.[ADDRESS_832561] has had an opportunity to spontaneously mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by [CONTACT_287367]: 
1. Have there been any (other) medical problems since your last visit/assessment?”  
2. Have any new medications been taken, other than those given to you in this study, since 
your last visit/assessment?”  
7.4.1 Time Period for Detecting and Reporting of AEs and SAEs  
The time period for detecting and reporting AEs and SAEs is f rom the time of informed consent 
through study completion/withdrawal, including the follow-up period.  
7.4.[ADDRESS_832562] s, but 
Investigator s are encouraged to notify the Sponsor/designee of any SAEs occurring at any time 
after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that they judge may reasonably 
be related to study treatment or study participation.   7.[ADDRESS_832563]’s 
Protocol RBSC2161; Version [ADDRESS_832564] be documented on the 
paper SAE Report Form.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis for the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE or 
SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  When this is not possible, the AE should be 
documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_624890]. Each AE which appears to be independent of any prior event will be 
reported separately.  
For clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments meeting the definition of an AE or SAE, a diagnosis, if known (or clinical signs and symptoms if  a diagnosis 
is unknown), should be recorded by [CONTACT_737] . If a diagnosis is unknown and clinical signs 
and symptoms are not present, then the abnormal finding should be recorded. When documenting as an SAE on the SAE Report Form, relevant laboratory (including the reference range and units) or copi[INVESTIGATOR_624863] (with reference ranges and units) should be sent with the SAE Report Form. 
The SAE Report Form should be completed as thoroughly as possible and signed by [CONTACT_74320]/her designee before transmittal to the  Sponsor/designee .  Investigators should 
not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event before notifying the Sponsor of an SAE.  It is very important that the Investigator (or designee)  provide his/her assessment of 
causality to study product at the time of initial SAE reporting.  
7.6 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
The severity of events will be determined based on the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE), version 5.0. The CTCAE quick reference guide can be found at: 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R
eference_8.5x11.pdf 
For events not specifically addressed in the CTCAE, the following definitions should be 
considered when evaluating the severity of AEs and SAEs: 
Protocol RBSC2161; Version 6 .0, 12 April  2022   Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 55 of 77  Severity of Event  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL*. 
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabli ng; 
limiting self -care ADL**.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using 
the telephone, managing money, etc.  
** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden. 
 
7.7 Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either 
“Related” or “Not Related.”   
• Related:  There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the study 
drug.  Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE. 
• Not Related:  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the 
study drug.  This assessment implies that the AE/SAE has little or no temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely or certain alternative etiology exists. 
The following should be considered  when assessing AE/SAE causality:  
• Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if study drug was withdrawn and the SAE resolved, or the event recurred after re-introduction, 
• If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an underlying or concomitant illness.  
Protocol RBSC2161; Version 6 .0, 12 April  2022   Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 56 of 77  • Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy, 
• No temporal relationship to treatment with study drug a nd/or a more likely alternative 
etiology exists. 
• If the AE is directly related to study procedures. 
7.[ADDRESS_832565] to follow -up.  The Investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be 
indicated to elucidate as completely as practical the nature and/or causality of the AE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] (i .e., discharge summary), or consultation with other health care professionals. 
Salix may request that the Investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations.  If a subject dies during participation in the study or during follow- up period, the Sponsor/designee should be provided with a copy of any postmortem 
findings, including histopathology. 
If cause of death is not available within the 24-hour reporting period, “death” must be reported as 
SAE term to meet timelines and the cause of death actively queried and submitted as a follow -up 
report.  
When additional SAE information becomes available, it should be recorded on a new SAE Report 
Form and should be labeled as a “Follow- up Report ”.  The original SAE Report Form  should not 
be altered.  All completed SAE Report Form s must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_47362]. By [CONTACT_624891], the Investigator or designee attests to the accuracy 
and completeness of the data and that he/she has reviewed and approved the report being submitted.  The investigational sites IRB/EC must be notified about SAEs in accordance with the requirements of the governing IRB/EC.  
Patients should be monitored for development of Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea  
(CDAD). If a patient develops severe, unremitting diarrhea, a diagnosis of Clostridium difficile -
associated diarrhea (CDAC) should be considered and investigated. If CDAD is confirmed during 
the study, the interventional therapy will be stopped, and the subject will be discontinued from the 
trial. Symptoms of CDAD may be non- specific and indistinguishable from other causes of 
diarrhea, but if CDAD is suspected, study drug must be held until CDAD can be ruled out. If 
CDAD is confirmed , then the interventional therapy will be stopped, and the subject will be 
discontinued from the trial. CDAD must also be reported as an AE or SAE depending on presentation. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic 
treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.  
 
Protocol RBSC2161; Version [ADDRESS_832566] be reported promptly t o the Sponsor/designee once the Investigator determines that the 
event meets the protocol definition of a SAE. 
Prompt reporting of an SAE requires:  
• Completion and transmission of the SAE Report Form to the Sponsor/designee via email  or 
fax within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  In parallel, a corresponding 
AE with the SAE details should be entered into the AE eCRF  within 48 hours of submitting 
the paper SAE Report Form .   
• Prompt reporting of additional information for previously reported SAEs should follow the 
same reporting timeframe as initial reports. In addition, the corresponding AE in the AE eCRF  
(as applicable) should be updated to ensure all data points documented in the AE eCRF  are 
aligned with the matchin g data points on the paper SAE Report Form. 
7.10 Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancies detected in subjects assigned to study treatment should be promptly reported to the 
Sponsor/designee via email/fax , using the Pregnancy Report Form , as soon as the Investigator is 
notified .  If a female subject becomes pregnant following assignment to study treatment, the study 
drug will be immediately discontinued , and the subject will be followed until the outcome of the 
pregnancy is known. (Refer to the S ection  4.4).   
The Sponsor/designee should be notified via email/fax of any updates on the status of the 
pregnancy within [ADDRESS_832567] be reported.  
Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical study is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any 
pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be recorded as an AE or SAE and followed as such.  If a pregnancy is associated with an SAE, an SAE Report Form should be 
forwarded to the Sponsor /designee within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s awareness , along with the 
Pregnancy Report Form.  
7.11 Transmission of SAE Report Forms and Pregnancy Report Forms  
Completed SAE Report Forms and completed Pregnancy Report F orms should be transmitted to 
the Sponsor/designee via the email address provided below:

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 58 of 77  7.12 Contraception Requirements  
All women of childbearing (reproductive) potential and all men must practice effective 
contraception during the study and for [ADDRESS_832568] dose. 
For the purposes of this study, women who do not meet one of the following criteria listed below 
are considered physiologically capable of becoming pregnant and are, therefore, defined as women of childbearing potential: 
• Postmenopausal 
• 24 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea without an alter native medical cause  
• 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy 
• Post- hysterectomy  
• Female surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation)  
For the purposes of the study, effective contraception is defined as use of 2 of the following for females:  
• Oral contraceptives taken for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit  and maintain 
contraceptive regimen throughout the study. 
• Placement of a non -hormonal intrauterine device or intrauterine system. 
• Barrier methods of co ntraception with use of a spermicide: condom or occlusive cap 
(diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream suppository. The 
use of barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide. 
• Male surgical s terilization (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the 
absence of sperm in the ejaculate).  
For the purposes of the study, effective contraception is defined as use of 1 of the following for 
males:  
• Effective male contraception includes a vasectomy with negative semen analysis at 
follow-up. 
• The use of condoms with spermicide. 
• Confirmation of birth control practiced by [CONTACT_624892]. 
True abstinence, when this is consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, can 
be considered an acceptable method of contraception based on the evaluation of the Investigator, 
who should also take into consideration the duration of the clinical trial.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not considered acceptable methods of contraception.

the Investigator must obtain  a new authorization from the subject or a waiver of authorization from 
the IRB/EC or privacy board, as applicable.  If the ICF is amended during the study, the 
Investigato r must follow all applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to approval of the 
amended Informed Consent Form by [CONTACT_1201]/EC and use of the amended form (including for 
ongoing subjects). The ICF documents the study- specific information the Investigator provides to the subject and the 
subject’s agreement to participate.  The Investigator will fully explain in layman’s terms the nature 
of the study, along with the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential risks,  and any discomfort 
participation may ent ail.  The ICF must be appropriately signed and dated before the subject 
undergoes any study- related procedure.  The decision regarding subject participation in the study 
that is made either by [CONTACT_29159]’s legally acceptable representative is entirely 
voluntary.  The Investigator or his/her designee must emphasize to the subject that consent 
regarding study participation may be withdrawn at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to 
which the subject is otherwise entitled.  
The ICF shall  also contain the subject's authorization for the use and disclosure of his/her PHI in 
connection with the study.  The authorization shall include at a minimum a clear description of: the duration of the authorization, the subject's right of access to the PHI (or any suspension thereof during the course of the study), type of information to be used/disclosed in the study, the names or classes of parties that may use or disclose the PHI, the purpose of the use/disclosure of PHI, the extent of the subject's right to revoke the authorization, the extent to which participation in the 
Protocol RBSC2161; Version [ADDRESS_832579]’s legally 
acceptable representative(s) will be allowed to sign the ICF.  This applies to all amended Informed 
Consent F orms as well.  
A separate healthy volunteer Inform Consent will be provided for flow cytometry assessment  
(approximately 25 subjects). These healthy volunteers will not be asked to take part in the study.  
The original and any amended signed and dated ICFs  must be retained in the subject’s file at the 
study site; and a copy must be given to the subject or subje ct’s legally acceptable representative(s).

In addition, Salix reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this study 
either at a single site or at all sites at any time and for any reason.  If such action is taken, Salix will discuss this with the Investigator (including the reasons for taking such action) at that time.  
Salix will promptly inform all other Investigator s and/or institutions conducting the study if the 
study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons and  will also inform the regulatory authorities 
of the suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action.  If required by [CONTACT_5279], the Investigator must inform the IRB/EC promptly and provide the reason 
for the suspension or termination.

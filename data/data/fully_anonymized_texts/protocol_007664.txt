Protocol Title:  
A PI[INVESTIGATOR_91574]-TRANSPLANT HIGH DOSE CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE (PTCY) AS 
PART OF GRAFT -VERSUS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS IN T-CELL REPLETE 
HLA-MISMATCHED UNRELATED DONOR (MMUD) ABLATIVE  AND REDUCED INTENSITY  
HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATION (HCT) FOR HEMATOLOGICAL 
MALIGNANCIES  
Brief Protocol Title for the Lay Public (if applicable):  
Use of Cyclophosphamide for Graft-versus-Host Disease in mismatched unrelated donor HCT.  
Study Phase:  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_91576]:  
Single Center: City of Hope  National Medical Center  
Rationale for this Study:  
MMUD HCT is associated with poorer outcome primarily due to increased risk of GVHD -related 
mortality. At City of Hope, we have explored and evaluated the use of Tacrolimus/Sirolimus-
based GVHD prophylaxis for MUD and MMUD HCT over the past [ADDRESS_101185] using Tacrolimus/Sirolimus-based regimens. PTCy  has been shown to be effective in 
preventing GVHD in haploidentical donor HCT and MUD HCT. However, limited data exist for its 
efficacy in preventing GVHD and improving outcomes of MMUD HCT. In this protocol, we aim t o 
investigate the ability of PTCy to overcome the increased incidence of GVHD and subsequent 
increased risk of non -relapse mortality ( NRM) expected after MMUD HCT. 
Objectives:  
In patients undergoing T-cell replete HLA -mismatched unrelated donor hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancy , using either an ablative or reduced intensity  
conditioning regimen: 
Primary objective:  
 To estimate the GVHD -free relapse/progression -free survival (GRFS)  at one-year post 
HCT and to evaluate the clinical activity of post -transplant high dose 
cyclophosphamide (PTCy) .   
Secondary objectives:  
 To summarize toxicities/complications /infections including type, frequency, severity, 
attribution, time course and duration through [ADDRESS_101186]-transplant. 
 To estimate the cumulative incidence  (CI) of acute and chronic GVHD.  
 To characterize the time course of neutrophil and platelet recovery/engraftment.  
 To estimate overall survival (OS), progression-free survival ( PFS), CI of 
relapse/progression, and non -relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 
years.  
 To describe quality of life at 100 days, 6 months, 1 and 2 years.  
 To characterize immune cell reconstitution and T cell repertoire after MMUD HCT with

Clinical Observations and Tests to be Performed:  
Clinical observations include the endpoints;  
 GRFS, defined as time from start of treatment (HCT) to grade 3-[ADDRESS_101190].  
 Toxicity/infections  
 Acute and Chronic GVHD 
 Engraftment (Neutrophil and Platelet Recovery)  
 Overall and Progression -Free Survival  
 Relapse/Progression  
 Quality of Life using validated tools  
Other routine evaluations and ancillary tests will be performed as per standard of care (SOC). 
As research correlative studies w e will evaluate the reconstitution of the immune system 
including a comprehensive characterization of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in patients 
who underwent MMUD HCT using a next generation sequencing (NSG) approach. 
Statistical Considerations:  
We will be examining the clinical activity and safety of PTCy  in patients undergoing T -cell 
replete MMUD HCT for hematologic malignancy. A total of 38 patients , 19 patients per stratum  
is sufficient to estimate the GRFS rate at 1 year with adequate precision (standard error = .08 
overall, = 0.12 per stratum) .  
 Survival estimates will be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier method  and Greenwood 
formula will be used to calculate the standard errors .  
 The cumulative incidence of relapse/progression and non -relapse mortality will be 
calculated as competing risks according to Gooley et al .1

2.0 Background  
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established treatment for a large 
number of inherited metabolic and immune deficiencies and for benign and malignant blood and 
marrow conditions. However, Graft -versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) continues to be a major 
problem with substantial morbidi ty and mortality limiting the general value on the procedure. 
GvHD results from a complex interaction between recipi[INVESTIGATOR_91578].[ADDRESS_101197] antigen presenting cells 
(APC) leading to amplification of the systemic inflammatory response , now with contribution of 
donor cells. In the last phase, host tissues are subjected to damage and apoptosis driven 
inflammatory cytokines and cellular effectors, thus establishing a positive inflammatory feedback 
loop. Even in the setting of HLA -matched donor s, patient and donor can differ in self-peptides 
derived from minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA). Those polymorphic peptides are 
presented by [CONTACT_79940] I antigens (rarely HLA class II) and can trigger the activation of donor -
derived T cells. A number of  these mHAs have been identified.[ADDRESS_101198].4  
The currently used GvHD prophylactic regimens are base d on the routine use of different 
combinations of methotrexate, calcineurin or mTOR inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil and 
13 
 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]  Version Date:   07/03/2019  
Version:  04 
 antithymocyte globulins (ATG).5 Yet even in the setting of HLA -matched donor s, clinically 
significant (grade II -IV) and severe (grade III -IV) acute GvHD (aGvHD) still occur in about 35 -
50% and 15% of cases, respectively. The lat ter is always associated with decreased survival.6 
Chronic GvHD (cGvHD) occurs in up to 70% of patients either after aGvHD or de novo and is 
also associated with substantial morbidity and mort ality.6 Risk of GvHD is further increased in 
those undergoing mismatched donor transplants leading to absolute decrease in survival 
approaching up to 10% in different studies.6-[ADDRESS_101199] s. For 
instance, methotrexate can independently cause tiss ue injury; paradoxically exacerbating the 
cytokine cascade associated with GvHD.13 Also calcineurin inhibitors, by [CONTACT_91611] -2 T-cell 
responses can be damaging to regulatory (CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3 +) T cell population. 14 The 
decrease in number and function of r egulatory T cell is associated with worsening of cGvHD. 
15,16 
Approximately 40% and up to 70% of patients with acute and chronic GvHD will have durable 
responses to corticosteroid therapy, respectively. Over the past [ADDRESS_101200] -transplant methotrexate to prevent GvHD; in the 1980s cyclosporine was 
shown to be superior to methotrexate and in [ADDRESS_101201], phase III trials 
comparing tacrolimus/methotrexate versus cyclosporine/methotrexate for related and unrelated 
donors have been performed. In the unrelated donor setting, the incidenc e of grade II -IV acute 
GvHD was 56% among the 46 patients randomized to tacrolimus arm versus 74% among the 
63 patients randomized to cyclosporine arm.22 Currently, the combination of 
tacrolimus/methotrexate remains a standard for GvHD prophylaxis, despit e its limited efficacy. 
However, improved GvHD prophylaxis is a significant clinical need in HCT.  
2.1.1 Rationale for mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) and suboptimal outcome  
Only 30% of patients in need of HCT have an available  matched sibling donor (MSD), therefore 
the majority of patients who are in need of this procedure will have to undergo an alternative 
donor search. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_91579] (UD) available 
through the National Marrow  Donor Program (NMDP), significant number of patients will not 
have a well -matched (at least; 8/8 HLA -A, B-, C-, DRB1) unrelated donor (MUD).[ADDRESS_101202] probability among whites of European descent (at 75%), and the lowest 
probability among blacks of south or Central American descent (at 16%).[ADDRESS_101203] a matched donor available to them, options include mismatched unrelated (MMUD), 
cord blood, or haploidentical donors. Early studies of HCT with alterative donor sources have 
reported worse outcome due to poor engraftment, delayed immune reconstitution with i ncreased 
risk of infection, and high incidence of GvHD. Progress in the last decade has significantly 
improved the outcome of alternative donor HCT. This progress is attributed to better donor 
selection, vigorous and on -target GvHD prophylaxis, and  the introduction of more suitable

Version:  [ADDRESS_101204] has been associ ated with inferior transplant 
outcomes regardless of preparative regimen intensity,8,24,25 and graft source [bone marrow (BM) 
or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)]8,10,[ADDRESS_101205] GvHD prophylaxis regimens of 
methotrexate combined with a calcineurin inhibitor (CI). When the novel tacrolimus/sirolimus 
(T/S)-based GvHD  prophylaxis regimen was compared with “standard of care” 
methotrexate/tacrolimus (M/T) in a phase III randomized study, results were  equivalent in the 
setting of fully matched  related donor alloHCT.[ADDRESS_101206], it has been used in the setting of MMUD with or 
without additional agents (ATG, Methotrexate, bortezom ib, etc.). The outcome of this group of 
patients was never studied systemically until recently when it was presented in large 
retrospective cohort by [CONTACT_27156] (Al Malki, MM. et al. BBMT 2016; Abstract 7712).  In this 
study, we evaluated a consecutive case -series of [ADDRESS_101207] at City 
of Hope from 2005 to 2013 using a MUD (8/[ADDRESS_101208]: n=351) or 
MMUD (≤7/8 match: n=131). Mini -MTX was added in 25% of patients, ATG in 6.4%, or both in 
1.8%. Conditioning was myeloablative in 45% of patients. Indication for HCT was acute

Therefore, novel GvHD prophylaxis regimens are needed to overcome the inferior outcome in 
this group of patients  who receive MMUD HCT .  
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_101209]-transplant Cyclophosphamide for GvHD prophylaxis  
High dose cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppress ive agent that has been successfully 
used to prevent GvHD in unrelated, HLA -matched sibling and haploidentical bone 
marrow/PBSC transplants in single center as well as in multi -center studies.29-[ADDRESS_101210] because of their high content in aldehyde dehydrogenase (AD), which converts 4 -
hydroxcyclophosphamide into a non-alkylating metabolite .37  In a mouse model, the drug 
fostered conversion of naïve CD4 + T cells into regulatory T cells (Ganguly, S. et al. Blood 
2010; Abstract 3749). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide in Haploidentical Donor Transplants  
Based on promising pre -clinical results at Johns Hopkins, a Phase I/II clinical trial of 
haploidentical HCT to treat high -risk hematologic malignancies was initiated in 1999.38,39  
Following a non -myeloablative (NMA) regi men of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and low -dose 
TBI, GvHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclophosphamide ( PTCy) given on Days +3 and +[ADDRESS_101211] -
transplant, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) ( Figure  2).33  Primary graft failure

 occurred in 13% of patients, and was fatal due to infection in one patient in whom autologous 
hematopoiesis failed to occur.  In general, complete T -cell engraftment was observed by [CONTACT_2006] 
+28 or the grafts were rejected.  Cumulative incidences of grades II -IV and grades III -IV acute 
GvHD by [CONTACT_2006] 200 were 34% and 6%, respectively.  There was lower incidence of extensive 
chronic GVHD among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_91580] (5% versus 25%; p=.05).   
There was no difference in the incidence of severe acute GvHD with one or two doses of PTCy.  
The cumulative incidences of non -relapse mortality and relapse at 1 year were 15% and 51%, 
respectively. Overall and event -free survivals (EFS) at two years aft er transplantation were 36% 
and 26%, respectively.  Patients with lymphoid malignancies appeared to have improved EFS 
compared to those with myeloid malignancies (p= 0.02). 
The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) sponsored a multi -center 
Phase II trial of haploidentical BMT (BMT CTN 0603) for high -risk hematologic malignancies 
modeled after the Hopkins approach.  This was published along with a simil ar study using cord 
blood grafts without PTCy (BMT CTN 0604).32 The 1-year probabilities of OS and PFS were 
54% and 46% after cord transplantation and 62% and 48% after haploidentical bone marrow 
transplantation.   
The Day +56 cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery was 94% after double umbilical cord 
blood and 96% after haploidentical marrow  transplants.  The 100-day cumulative incidence of 
grade II-IV acute GVHD was 40% with cord blood and 32% with haploidentical bone marrow.  
The 1-year cumulative incidences of NRM and relapse after cord transplantation wer e 24% and 
31%, respectively; corresponding rates after haploidentical bone marrow transplantation were 
7% and 45%.  
The use of PBSC instead of marrow may allow wider applicability of this approach but there is 
concern about higher risks of acute and chroni c GVHD due to the 5 -10-fold higher number of T -
cells in the allograft. Recently, groups from Atlanta, Houston and London reported studies in 
which PBSC were substituted for bone marrow with PTCy in the haploidentical donor setting.  
Error! Bookmark not defined.40-42  In those studies, the incidences of severe acute GVHD, 
chronic GVHD and non -relapse mortality at 1 year with PBSC were comparable to the rates 
seen with bone marrow.  
[IP_ADDRESS] PTCy in HLA Matched Donor s 
After the success of PTCy  in the prevention of GvHD in the setting of haploidentical 
transplantation, Luznik et al29 reported a large study of patients who underwent allogeneic HCT 
from HLA-matched donors after MA conditioning using busulfan -cyclophosphamide (BuCy) and 
PTCy as a single agent for prophylaxis of GvHD. A total of 117 patients with high -risk 
hematologic malignancies were transplanted from MSD (n=78) or MUD (n=39). Half of the 
patients were not in remission at the time of transplant.  Bone marrow grafts w ere used for all 
patients. The incidence of GvHD was remarkably low (43% grades II -IV acute, 10% grades III/IV 
acute, 10% chronic) showing the effectiveness of the approach ( Figure  3).  There was no 
difference in the incidence of acute or chronic GvHD between MSD and MUD.  Almost two -
thirds of the patients did not require any additional immunosuppressive therapy after PTCy.  
Patients who did develop GvHD responded to steroids alone in  20% of cases or steroids plus a 
second agent (calcineurin or non -calcineurin) in 75% of cases.  Rates of grade II -IV acute and 
chronic GVHD were both 10%.  Observed rates of non -relapse mortality and disease relapse 
were 20% and 44%, respectively.  This s tudy showed that PTCy was effective as a single -agent 
to prevent severe acute or chronic GvHD in the vast majority of patients undergoing MAC HCT 
from matched donors.  Only 3% of deaths were due to infection suggesting that immune

These encouraging outcomes with PTCy in prevention of GvHD were recently reproduced in a 
multi-institutional study that effectively combined this novel single -agent short-course GvHD 
prevention strategy in combination with IV Bu/Flu MA conditioning.  In this study,43 92 adult 
patients (median age 49; range=21 -65) with high -risk hematologic malignancies were enrolled 
at three centers.  Forty -five (49%) patients received related allografts, and 47 (51%) received 
unrelated allografts .  GvHD prophylaxis was solely with PTCy at 50 mg/kg/day on post -
transplant days +3 and +4 after bone marrow allografting. The cumulative incidences of grade 
II-IV acute, grade III -IV acute, and chronic GVHD were 51%, 15%, and 14%, respectively.  NRM 
at 100 days and 1 year were 9% and 16%, respectively.  With a 2.2 year median follow -up, the 
two-year EFS and OS were 62% and 67%, respectively.  Donor type did not impact on NRM, 
EFS, or OS.  Patients in complete remission (CR) without evidence of minimal resi dual disease 
had remarkably high rates of EFS (80%) and OS (79%).  
Champlin, R. el al reported a similar GvHD preventive strategy in the setting of RIC combining 
fludarabine, busulfan with or without rabbit ATG in a group of 31 older and medically frail 
patients receiving matched related or unrelated donor transplant (Alousi, A. et al. Blood 2010; 
Abstract 2314). The incidence of grade III and IV acute GvHD was 13% and of chronic GvHD 
11%. Primary and secondary graft failure occurred in 1 and 2 patients resp ectively. The 1-year 
OS of was impressive for such a high-risk population.  
In another study conducted by [CONTACT_91614]44, PTCy was combined with a brief course of 
sirolimus in a calcineurin inhibitor -free regimen. Twenty -six patients (median age, 61 years) 
underwent unmanipulated PBSC HCT from an 8/8 locus -matched donor (MRD= 17; MUD= 9). 
Donor engraftment occurred in all patients. The cumulative incidence of grade II -IV acute 
GVHD, grade III -IV acute GVHD, and chronic GVHD was 46%, 15%, and 31% respectively. 
One-year NRM was 4%. The median time to immunosuppression discontinuation was day 
+138. With a median follow -up of 20 months, the estimated 2 -year overall survival was 71 %, 
estimated disease -free survival was 64%, and estimated relapse incidence was 32%. In patients 

18

 with a lymphoid malignancy (e.g., chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, non -Hodgkin lymphoma, 
Hodgkin disease), 2 -year disease -free survival was 100%, and there were  no relapses. Good 
immune reconstitution was evidenced by [CONTACT_91615] 21% (n=4/19).  
Al-Homsi, A. et al. reported feasibility of phase I combining PTCy with a brief course of 
proteasome inhibitor (i.e. bortezomib)45, in this study [ADDRESS_101213] from MSD or MUD. Cyclophosphamide was given at a fixed dose (50 mg/kg on 
days +3 and +4). Bortezomib dose was started at 0.7 mg/m2, escalated up to 1.3 mg/m2, and 
was administered on days 0 and +3. Patients receiving grafts from MUD also received rab bit 
ATG. The combination was well tolerated  and allowed prompt engraftment in all patients. The 
incidences of acute GVHD grades II to IV and grades III and IV were 20% and 6.7%, 
respectively. With a median follow -up of 9.1 months (range, 4.3 to 26.7), trea tment-related 
mortality was 13.5% with predicted 2 -year disease -free survival and overall survival of 55.7% 
and 68%, respectively.  
With the excellent results obtained in these studies and the ineffectiveness of the available 
“standard” GvHD prophylaxis regimens in overcoming the deleterious effect of HLA - 
mismatched donor s, we expect that the use of PTCy for GvHD prophylaxis as a novel regimen 
will improve outcome s of patients undergoing MMUD HCT in this clinical trial.  
2.1.[ADDRESS_101214]; the mean CD4+ T cell count on day 30 was 98 cells/μl and on day 60 was 124 cells/μl.[ADDRESS_101215], the CD8+ T cell counts were already within the normal range.

In the above-described studies,29,43 no patients died of CMV or invasive fungal infection. 
Reactivation of CMV occurred in 29% of patients, and there were only two documented cases of 
CMV disease. The rapid recovery of CMV -specific immunity correlated with the results of in vitro 
ELISPOT assays.  The frequency of cells secreting interferon gamma in response to stimulation 
with pentadeca -peptides of the immune -dominant CMV protein, pp65, at day 30 –[ADDRESS_101217] did not differ from pre -transplantation specimens from CMV -seropositive 
donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_91582]. The absence of post -transplantation Epstein –Barr virus-associated 
lymphoproliferative disease is another indicator of the prompt immunologic recovery seen with 
PTCy. [ADDRESS_101218] and has 
been shown to be comparable to immune reconstitution in mat ched donor (MSD and MUD) 
undergoing transplant with “standard” GvHD prophylaxis regimen.35,46,47 But this needs to be 
studied in the setting of MMUD, which is going to be one of the objectives of this clinical trial as 
well.  
2.2 Overview of Proposed Study

 5.2.2 Hematopoietic Cell Graft Source  
Mobilized PBSC is the preferred  graft source for patients enrolled in this clinical trial. BM 
could be use d alternatively at the discretion of the attending physician and principle 
investigator  
 Donors will undergo G -CSF mobilization according to institutional and donor center 
practices.  PBSC will be collected by [CONTACT_91619].  
Plasma and red cell depletion are allowed for volume reduction or ABO incompatibility 
but any other form of graft manipulation (including ex -vivo T cell depletion) is not 
permitted. The target stem cell dose is between 2 x 106/kg and 6 x 106/kg (actual body 
weight) CD34+ cells. The maximum CD34+ cell dose is 6 x 106/kg.  Up to two 
leukapheresis procedures may  be performed to obtain the minimum CD34+ cell target.  
If, after two leukapheresis procedures, fewer than 2 x 106/kg CD34+ cells have been 
collected, transplant centers will have the discretion to continue PBSC cell harvesting or 
to proceed to bone marrow  harvesting to obtain sufficient cells.  If more than 6 x 106/kg 
CD34+ stem cells are collected, the excess will be cryopreserved for future use, but will

5.7.1 Laboratory Studies 
See Section 10.0 – Study Calendar for a complete list of required laboratory procedures. 
Correlative studies including i mmune cell reconstitution studies  (T and B cells , and NK cells) - 
TCR repertoire , and assessment of plasma cytokines and GVHD biomarkers  (described in 
Section 9.0) will be performed on patient peripheral blood and plasma samples at pre-
transplant, and  post-transplant on days7, 14, 21, 28 (±2 days), 42, 6 3 (± 7 days) 100 and 180 (± 
14 days), and, 1 and 2 years (± 30 days) post-transplant. 
6.0 Expected Toxicities, Dose Delays/Modifications for Adverse Events  
6.1 Expected Toxicities  (most severe and/or persistent)  
HCT conditioning consists of high dose combination chemotherapy and may results in multiple 
grade [ADDRESS_101237] conditioning regimens cause potentially lethal myelosuppression that requires 
stem cell infusion for replacement of blood and immune functions. If the infused stem cells fail to 
engraft, death may result.  
6.1.2 Graft Infusion  Reactions 
Symptoms may include changes in heart rate and/or rhythm, changes in blood pressure, 
fever, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], hemoglobinuria, 
acute renal failure, allergic reactions, respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517], or headac he. 
6.1.3 Infections 
Transplantation puts the patient at higher risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, which 
are potentially life -threatening.  Prophylaxis will be initiated and patients will be closely 
monitored for signs of infections and will receiv e early and appropriate treatment . 
28 
 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]  Version Date:   07/03/2019  
Version:  [ADDRESS_101238] Disease  
After allogeneic transplantation , chronic GVHD may develop that can be disabling and can 
lead to death.  GVHD is thought to be initiated by T -cells contained in the graft.  PTCy 
reduce the number  of alloreactive T -cells but GVHD can still occur after transplant.  
6.1.5 Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS)/ Veno -occlusive Disease (VOD) of the 
Liver  
SOS/VOD is a manifestation of damage to the liver by [CONTACT_91622]:  
 Hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin > 2 mg/dL)  
 Hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant pain, or  
 Sudden weight gain (> 5% above baseline)  
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_91587]/VOD will receive appropriate supportive care and careful fluid 
management.   
6.1.6 End Organ Damage  
End organ damage of any or all of the major organs, including the brain, may occur as a result 
of cumulative toxicity from anti -neoplastic therapy, reactions to other drugs, and as a result of 
destructive processes (e.g., infection, GVHD, etc.) and may have a fatal outcome.  Toxicities 
may occur in any individual patient due to multiple events and cumulative effects that may 
involve any an d all organs, including the brain.  Brain damage can result in severe loss of 
cognitive or neurologic function

lymphoproliferative disorder (P TLD) caused by [CONTACT_91623] -term 
immunosuppression therapy.  Patients who develop a fever of unknown origin to > 39oC, 
lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly, should undergo CT scanning of the chest and 
abdomen and/or PET scan to rule  out or stage EBV PTLD.  Tissue diagnosis that includes 
EBER and LMP -1 IHC should be attempted.  Other diagnostic or staging studies will be 
performed as clinically indicated.  EBV PTLD may rapi[INVESTIGATOR_91588].  Management of s uspected EBV PTLD should be discussed with principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_7966].  EBV PTLD can be treated with rituximab with or without chemotherapy.  It is 
recommended that patients with increased EBV DNA levels receive rituximab pre -emptively.   
6.1.8 Death 
There is an approximate 5 -10% risk of transplant -related mortality within the first month of 
transplant due to the risk of severe regimen -related toxicity, hemorrhage, opportunistic infection, 
or other complications.  It is not expected that the regimens to be used in this protocol will 
increase this risk.

Version:  [ADDRESS_101244] indicated that there is a ten -fold variability area under the 
curve (AUC) of the drug among patients receiving busulfan by [CONTACT_1966]. There is a sta tistical 
association between increased AUC and the development of VOD of the liver. Since its FDA 
approval in 1999, IV Bu has been used increasingly in combination with CY or Flu. IV Bu 
was initially administered every [ADDRESS_101245] similar toxicity profiles.  It has been proposed that VOD and mucositis may 
be reduced in incidence and severity with IV Bu.   The IV formulation at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg 
IV every 6-hrs is considered equivalent to the oral formulation at a dose of 1 mg/kg PO 
every 6 hrs. in conditioning regimens.  On this basis a regimen using 4x0.8 = 3.2 mg/kg as a 
single daily dose has been deve loped.  
8.1.2 Toxicology 
Toxicities associated with busulfan administration include:  
o Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, 
anorexia, dyspepsia and mucositis  
o Hepatobiliary: Veno -occlusive disease

8.2 Cyclophosphamide  
8.2.1 Description/Pharmacology  
Cyclophosphamide (CY) is an alkylating agent which prevents cell division primarily by 
[CONTACT_12783]-linking DNA strands.  CY is converted to its active form in vivo by [CONTACT_91625].  
After a single dose, tissue enzymes degrade most of the active metabolites.  After high 
doses (> 40 mg/kg), the alkylating activity in the plasma is minimal by [ADDRESS_101246] toxic actions.  One of the metabolic products, acrolein 
(CH2=CH-CHO), is known to be toxic to the bladder urothelium and  can cause hemorrhagic 
cystitis when CY is administered at high doses.

11.2 Protocol Deviations  
11.2.1 Deviation Policy  
This protocol will be conducted in accordance with COH’s “Clinical Research Protocol Deviation 
Policy” located at http://www.coh.org/dsmc/Documents/Institutional%20Deviation%20Policy.pdf . 
Deviations from the written protocol that could increase patient risk or alter protocol integrity 
require prior IRB approval of a single subject exception (SSE) request.  In addition, if 
contractually obligated, the sponsor must also approve the deviation.  IRB pre -approved SSE 
protocol modifications are considered an amendment to the protocol and not a deviation.  The 
submission of a deviation report is not required.  
Brief interrupti ons and delays may occasionally be required due to travel delays, airport closure, 
inclement weather, family responsibilities, security alerts, government holidays, etc.  This can 
also extend to complications of disease or unrelated medical illnesses not r elated to disease 
progression.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_91597].  Examples include, 
but are not limited to:  a) dose adjustments based on excessive patient weight; b) alteration in 
treatment schedule due to non -availability of the research participant for treatment; c) laboratory 
test results which are slightly outside the protocol requirements but at levels that do not affect 
participant safety.   These instances are  considered to be deviations from the protocol.  A 
deviation report will be submitted to the DSMC/IRB within five days.  
11.2.[ADDRESS_101268] to 
report to the IRB following review . 
11.2.3 Resolving Disputes  
The COH Investigational Drug Service (IDS) cannot release a research ag ent that would cause 
a protocol deviation without approval by [CONTACT_978].  Whenever the protocol is ambiguous on a key 
point, the IDS should rely on the P I to clarify the issue.  
In situations where there is misperception or  dispute regarding a protocol deviation among the 
persons involved in implementing the protocol, it is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_91598] (or designee) to arrive at resolution.

 12.0 Endpoint Evaluation Criteria/Measurement of Effect  
12.1 Primary Endpoint  
 GVHD-free Relapse/Progression -free Survival ( GRFS): defined as time from start of 
treatment (HCT) to grade 3-4 acute GVHD , moderate-severe chronic GVHD , relapse, 
progression or death  (from any cause) , whichever occurs first.  If a patient has not 
experienced any of these events, GRFS is censored at time of last follow-up. 
12.2 Secondary Endpoints:  
 Toxicity: Toxicities will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 and the Bearman Toxicity Scale (for [ADDRESS_101269])48.   
Note: The highest gr ade of all toxicities will be recorded from Day -[ADDRESS_101270] 
grade of toxicities that meet grade 3, 4, or 5 per CTCAE v4.03 from day +31 to +[ADDRESS_101271] -
transplant will be collected . Start and stop dates will also be recorded for any grade 4 
neutropenia. 
 Unacceptable Toxicity: To be evaluable for toxicity, a patient must start conditioning and 
be observed for [ADDRESS_101272] possibly related to the study 
regimen: 
o For non-hematologic toxicities, any regimen -related grade III/IV toxicity per 
Bearman Toxicity Grading Scale or  
o For non-hematologic to xicities (not part of the Bearman toxicity grading scale), 
any ≥grade 4 toxicity per NCI CTCAE v4.03, except for metabolic/electrolyte 
disturbances and vomiting controlled by [CONTACT_91633].  
o For hematologic toxicities, per NCI CTCAE v4.03 toxicity criteria, any grade 4 
neutropenia associated with fever or infection and lasting for more than 21 days, 
or grade 4 neutropenia lasting for more than 28 days (engraftment failure)  42 
days acceptable for myelofibrosis patients to achieve engraftment  
o Any other regimen-related cause of death.  
 Infection: Microbiologically documented infections will be reported by [CONTACT_4622], 
date of onset, severity and resolution, if any. These data will be captured via case report 
form and will be collected from day [ADDRESS_101273] -transplant. 
 Acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGVHD) of grades 2 -4 and 3-4: Acute graft versus 
host disease is graded according to the 1994 Keystone Consensus Grading56 (Appendix 
B). The first day of acute  GVHD onset at a certain grade will be used to calculate 
cumulative incidence curves for that GVHD grade ; relapse/death prior to onset will be 
considered competing events.  The endpoint will be evaluated from day [ADDRESS_101274]-transplant. 
 Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD): Chronic graft versus host disease is scored 
according to NIH Consensus Staging57,58 (Appendix C) . The first day of chronic GvHD 
onset will be used to calculate cumulative incidence curves , with relapse / death prior to 
onset considered competing events . The endpoint wil l be evaluated from day [ADDRESS_101275].  
 Engraftment: Time to hematological recovery in terms of neutrophil (ANC≥500/μL, 
1.0x103/μL) and platelet (20x103/μL and 100x103/μL) engraftment time.

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]  Version Date:   07/03/2019  
Version:  04 
  Overall survival (OS): Patients are considered a failure for this endpoint if they die, 
regardless of cause. Time to this event is the time from start of protocol therapy to death, 
or last follow -up, whichever comes first.  
 Progression-free survival (PFS): Patients are considered a failure for this endpoint if they 
relapse/progress or die, regardless of cause. Time to this event is the time from start of 
protocol therapy to death, relapse/progression, or last follow -up, whichever comes first.  
 Relapse/Progres sion (CIR): The event is relapse/progression. Time to this event is 
measured from start of therapy. Death without relapse/progression is considered a 
competing risk. Surviving patients with no history of relapse/ progression are censored at 
time of last fo llow-up. 
  Non-relapse Mortality (NRM):  Patients are considered a failure for this endpoint if they 
die from causes other than relapse or progression. NRM is measured from start of 
therapy until non -disease related death, or last follow -up, whichever comes first. 
 Quality of Life (QOL): assessments include self -reported patient questionnaires: SF -
36, FACT-BMT, and MDASI for English and Spanish speaking patients > 18 years, 
and PedsQL Stem Cell Transplant Module for English speaking pediatric patients 
(ages 8 through 18 years).

13.0 Statistical Considerations  
13.1 Study Design  
We will assess the clinical activity , overall and per stratum (RIC or MAC) , and evaluate the  
safety of post -transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy ) in patients undergoing T -cell 
replete HLA -mismatched unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for

 hematologic malignancy. The primary endpoint for this single center, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/estimation study is 
one-year GVHD, relapse/progression -free survival (GRFS). 
13.2 Sample Size Accrual Rate  
Due to a lack of comparable historical data/  estimates65-67 for one-year GRFS in this setting , a 
total of 38 patients , with 19 patients per stratum is sufficient to estimate the GRFS rate at 1 year 
with adequate precision (standard error = .08 overall, = 0.12 per stratum (see the following table 
for detail). On average we perform 15 -20 MMUD HCTs annually at City of Hope. (Note: There is 
no competing trial for MMUD HCT since most of the HCT trials avoid  MMUD HCT. ) We 
anticipate that the accrual of 38 patients will take 2 years  to complete. With the primary endpoint 
of 1-yr GRFS, and up to 2-years of follow -up planned, the study is expected to complete in –
approximately 4 years.

13.3 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91599]. Within each stratum, 
the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91600]/toxicity will be assessed for each patient at day +[ADDRESS_101281]-
transplant/stem cell infusion. The expected rate of unacceptable toxicity  (defined in 12.2)  should 
not be ≥33%. See the table below for detailed early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. If the specified number of 
patients is met or exceeded , patient accrual will be halted and a full review of the data by [CONTACT_91637]. Patie nt accrual will not resume until 
approved by [CONTACT_91638].

Criteria for chronic GVHD per Jagasia et al., 2015  (62) 
Mild chronic GVHD  [ADDRESS_101324] 1 organ (not lung) with a score of [ADDRESS_101325] 1 organ with a score of 3  
OR 
Lung score of 2 or 3  
Key points: 
 
In skin:  
Higher of the 2 scores to be used for calculating global severity.  
In lung:  
FEV1 is used instead of clinical score for calculating global severity. 
 
If the entire abnormality in an organ is noted to be unequivocally explained by a non -GVHD documented cause, that 
organ is not included for calculation of the global severity.  
 
If the abnormality in an organ is attributed to multifactorial cause s (GVHD plus other causes) the scored organ will be 
used for calculation of the global severity regardless of the contributing causes (no downgrading of organ severity 
score).

Document Version Date Summary of Changes and Rationale
Amendment 6 21 September
2017The following changes were made:
The primary analysis set will be modified 
intent to treat (mITT) population.  This 
population will exclude all randomized subjects prior to amendment 4.  The study was initiated with higher doses of endotoxinwhich were then lowered under amendment 4.
Revised per protocol analysis set to include 
subjects in mITT population
  
20 additional subjects were added to ensure a 
total of 270 subjects in the mITT analysis set.
Added, as a covariate, time from the first RSE 
full dose to randomization in the analysis 
model.
Amendment 5 04 April 2017 The following change was made following FDA 
communication received on 31 March 2017recommending the use of IV acetaminophen instead of IV ketorolac as rescue medication
Rescue medication changed from IV 
ketorolac to IV acetaminophen (500 mg dose) 
and added the option for investigator or qualified individual to institute appropriate medical interventions at the discretion of the investigator including administration of IV ibuprofen (up to 400 mg dose) to subjects whose temperature continues to rise after administration of rescue IV acetaminophen.
Minor revisions and clarifications to ensure 
consistency in different sections were made.CCI

Page 12PROTOCOL SUMMARY
BACKGROUND/RATIONALE
Ibuprofen (IBU) and acetaminophen (APAP) are the two most widely  used non- prescription 
over-the-counter (OTC) analges ic/ antipy retic drugs both in the [LOCATION_002] and globally .  
The objective of this currently  proposed program is to develop a fixed- dose combination 
(FDC) of I BU plus APAP with efficacy  superior to either agent alone, without increasing the 
risk of side effects. Combining two different antipy retic agents with different mechanisms of 
action, such as IBU and APAP, may  provide superior efficacy  and may  also lower the total 
amount of each independent agent, thus lowering the risk of side effects associated w ith 
higher doses when taken as a single medication. 
OBJECTIVES AND ENDPO INTS
The objective of this study  is to evaluate the safet y and antipyretic efficacy of single , 
oraldoses of IBU/APAP 250 mg/[ADDRESS_857134] Endotoxin (RSE).
The primary  endpoint for this study  is the weighted sum of temperature differences 
from baseline (the time of dosing wi th study  medication) to 8 hours (WSTD0 -8);
weights being equal to the time elapsed between each two consecutive time points.
STUDY DESIGN
This study  isa single -center, 8-hours, single -dose, inpatient, double -blind, randomized, 
placebo- controlled, full-factorial, parallel arm, safety  and efficacy  study  in healthy  male 
subjects 18 to 55years of age (inclusive). Approximately  290 subjects will be enrolled in 
this study .
The study  iscomprised of a screening visit and a study  treatment period. The screening visit 
will occur within 28days prior to the study  treatment period. Subjects will remain at the 
research center during the study  treatment period for approximatel y 36hours over 2 days.  
Subjects will enter the study  center on Day  0and will remain in -house until after the 
completion of all study  procedures on Day 1, at the investigator’s discretion . Site personnel 
will conduct a safety  follow up within [ADDRESS_857135] dose of study  medication to ascertain if any  
Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs )have occurred .
Fever will be induced in healthy  male volunteers using RSE and temperature measurements 
will be taken throughout the study  to monitor the subject’s fever
. Once subje cts have 
received a dose of RSE, their oraltemperature will continue to be monitored at the discretion 
of the investigator approximately  every  5minutes using a n oral standardized electronic,
digital thermometer. Subject temperatures from test dose till randomization will be recorded 
in the source document.
All endpoints for this study  will be based on oral temperature measurements using a 
standardized electronic, digital thermometer.  Oral temperatures will be recorded at the 
following times:

in the study ;
Prior to administration of the test dose of RSE. This will be referred to as the
“normal ”temperature ;
Approximately  60and 90 minutes (90minutes if increase in temperature is 
<1°Fand subject experiences <2 systemic s ymptoms) after the test dose of RSE in 
order to determine thefull dose of RSE that the subject will receive.  After 
approximatel y 60 or 90 min(90min if increase in temperature is < 1°Fand subject 
experiences <2 systemic sy mptoms)  of receiving the test dose of RSE, subjects who
tolerate the test dose of RSE will receive a full dose of RSE
;
After the full dose of RSE when the subject has reached an oral temperature of 
100.5 °F. The subject’s oral temperature will need to be 100.5°F in order to be 
randomized to study  medication .  If the subject’s oral temperature is not 
100.5°F, additional oral temperature measurements will be taken and recorded in the 
source document approximately  every  5minute s until the subject reaches this 
temperature
or is given an additional dose of RSE. The time between the subject 
reaching an oral temperature of100.5F and being dosed should not exceed 
10minutes
;
Immediately  prior to study  medication dosing after the subject has reached an oral 
temperature of 100.5°F and has been randomized .This will be referred to as the 
“baseline ”temperature ;

At the discretion of t
he investigator , additional oral temperatures may be taken by [CONTACT_640436] y tomonitor the subject’s 
oral temperature .If the subject’s temperature exceeds 102.5oF , subjects may receive 
rescue medication .
An oral temperature will be taken and recorded prior to rescue 
medication administration.
Safety  evaluations including adverse event ( AE)monitoring , vital signs (blood pressure and 
pulse rate) , and respi[INVESTIGATOR_640417] . At the end of the 
8-hour post dose period or at the time of rescue medication (within 5 minutes) subjects will 
complete a global evaluation of study  medication using a categorical rating scale where 
applic able, and then will be discharged from the study  site.

Page 14STATISTICAL METHODS
The sample size calculation was partly based on the data from a previous induced fever study  
(Whitehall -Robins Protocol ED -93-03).  In that study, subjects with normal body  
temperature took study  medication 30 minutes prior to receiving Endotoxin . The estimated 
variability  (root mean square error RMSE ) of the weighted sum of temperatures difference 
over [ADDRESS_857137] 
and variability .14
In this study , we assume a treatment difference of 1.77 and 1.88 units in 
WSTD 0-8(weighted 
sum of temperature differences) for APAP/I BU vs I BU and APAP/I BU v
s. APAP, 
respectivel y, and a variability  (RMSE) of 3.406.  A sample of 78 subjects per active 
treatment group will be required to provide about 85% joint power to achieve statistical 
significance at two- sided 0.05 level.  Furthermore, this sample size for each active group and 
26subjects in placebo group (3:3:3:1 allocation ratio) will provide about 85% power to 
detect a treatment difference of 2.35 units in WSTD0-8 for the comparison of each active 
treatment to placebo. 
Therefore, a total of approximately  270 subjects are to be randomized into the study  after 
adjusting for additional 3.7% subjects who are randomized but not dosed or with no 
post-baseline data for analy sis.
Additional 20 subjects (two randomization blocks) will be randomized for a total of 
290subjects .  This addition ensures a total of approximately  270 subjects in the modified 
intent to treat (mITT) analy sispopulation which 
will include only  subjects randomized after 
protocol am endment 4.  Seventeen s ubjects (replaced by  [CONTACT_640437] 20 subjects) not included 
in the mI TT were dosed with a different RSE dosing algorithm than the RSE current dosing 
algorithm before amendment 4.   These subjects were dosed with much higher test and full
dose
s ofendotoxin.
All statistical tests will be performed at a two -sided 0.05 level of significance.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint, the weighted sum of temperature difference from baseline 
over 0 -
8hours (WSTD0- 8) will be anal yzed using an analysis of co variance ( AN COVA )
model with treatment group term and covariates baseline temperature and time from the first 
RSE full dose to randomization using mI TT.  Additional analy ses will be conducted based on 
the intent to treat ( ITT)analy sis set .
Time from the first RSE full dose to randomization is added to the model as s ubjects 
demonstrate dsignificant variations in time from RSE first full dose to randomization ( ie,
reaching thre shold temperature of 100.5) .
All measures relating to weighted sum of temperature difference from baseline, or 
temperature difference from baseline at i ndividual post -dose time point will be anal yzed by 
[CONTACT_640438].

treatment group term in the model.
The time to return to “normal temperature” (time until fever clearance) will be anal yzed 
using interval -censored survival anal ysis approach, since the exact time to fever clearance 
will not be observed.
Safety  (adverse events [ AE]/serious adverse events [ SAE ]) data will be summariz ed by  
[CONTACT_6660].  Post treatment vital signs and change from baseline values will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_22058] t groups.  Number and percent of subjects with abnormal

a.Treatments taken within [ADDRESS_857145]’s 
oral temperature will be recorded as their ‘ normal ’ temperature. Subject’s temperature will also be recorded 60 and 90 minutes (90minutes if increase in 
temperature is <1 °F and subject exp eriences <2 systemic sym ptoms) after the test dose of endotoxin in order to determine their full dose of endotoxin . After 
administration of a full dose of RSE, subjects will be monitored using the standardized, electronic digital thermometer until their oral tem perature reaches 
100.5F.The subject’s oral temperature will need to be 100.5 °F in order to be randomized to study medication.  If the subject’s oral temperature is not 
100.5 °F, additional oral temperature measurements will be taken every 5minutes until the subject re aches this temperature or is given an additional dose of 
RSE.  Within 10 minutes of reaching this temperature, subjects will be randomized and their oral temperature will be recorded immediately prior to dosing 
with study medication (this will be known as their ‘ baseline ’ temperature) .  Oral temperatures w ill also be recorded at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 
100and 110 minutes after dosing and at 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5 and 8 hours after dosing .  The following t ime windows will be allowed for

PF-[ADDRESS_857149] widely  used non- prescription OTC analgesic/ antipy retic 
drugs both in the [LOCATION_002] and globally .  The objective of this currently  proposed 
program is to develop a FDC of IBU plus APAP with efficacy  superior to either agent alone, 
without increasing the risk of si de effects. Combining two different antip yretic agents with 
different mechanisms of action, such as IBU and APAP, may  provide superior efficacy  and 
may also lower the total amount of each independent agent, thus lowering the risk of side 
effects associate d with higher doses when taken as a single medication .Both drugs have 
been extensivel y studied, and their efficacy  and safety  profiles in humans are 
well-established.
1.1.
Mechanism of Action/ Indication
FDC I BU/APAP is an analgesic/antipy retic formulation th at is being developed for OTC use.  
The FDC is intended to have the same indications as each individual medication: the relief of 
minor aches and pains due to headache, toothache, backache, menstrual cramps, the common 
cold, muscular aches, minor pain of a rthritis and the temporary  reduction of fever. 
Ibuprofen, a “traditional” non -steroidal anti -inflammatory  drug (NSAID), decreases the 
synthesis of pain -and inflammation -promoting prostaglandins via non- selective inhibition of 
cyclo-oxygenase -1(COX -1) an d cyclo-oxygenase -2(COX -2).1The mechanism of action of 
APAP, which has no significant anti -inflammatory  activity , is not clear.  However, it may  
involve COX inhibition in the central nervous s ystem and activa tion of central serotonergic 
pathway s.2,3IBU and APAP do not share metabolic pathway s, which diminishes the 
likelihood of drug-drug interactions.  Pharmacokinetic s tudies have demonstrated that there 
are no alterations in drug levels when the two analgesics are administered together, which is 
consistent with a lack of drug -drug interactions.4,[ADDRESS_857150] study  results as they  would likely  decrease the pain or fever 
associated with the infection
.  Using only  an antipy retic/analgesic to treat the infection, and 
not an antibiotic, would also not be appropriate as it would not treat the underl ying cause of 
the infection .  Therefore, a traditional fever study  is not appropriate for evaluating the 
antipy retic efficacy  of an antipy retic/analgesic combination treatment. 
Gram negative bacterial lipopoly saccharide (t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_158810] E. coli ), endotoxin is known to 
trigger inflammation and various other responses including fever.  The immune response to 
endotoxin ispredictable and reproducible which 
offers an opportunity  to evaluate therapeutic 
agents. Endotoxin results in a well characterized, transie nt acute fever response.  The model 
has been widel y used for decades as a s ystem to study  new therapeutic agents for fever and 
inflammation .  Worldwide, thousands of subjects have received controlled endotoxin doses 
and serious adverse events have been rar ely observed.  A monophasic rise in core body  
temperatures starts b y 1hour post -RSE dose, peaks at approximatel y 4hours, with increases 
of 2-
4°F above baseline, and returns to baseline by  8- 12hours post -RSE dose .  The 
endotoxin is cleared rapi[INVESTIGATOR_640419] b
lood.[ADDRESS_857151] demonstrated antipy retic efficacy  and are nonprescriptio n medications 
widely  used for the reduction of fever.  The main safet y concern with I BU use, primarily  at 
higher prescription doses over extended periods of time, is gastrointestinal toxicity .7APAP 
over-dosage may cause potentially  fatal hepatic failure.8Based on safet y concerns related to 
APAP, the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )has recommended reducing the maximum 
single adult dose of APAP in OTC products fro m 1,[ADDRESS_857152], there is no 
anticipated increase in the risk of adverse events . 
IBU/APAP combinations at OTC levels have been studied in humans, including single an d 
multiple dose pharmacokinetic studies , single and multiple dose oral surgery studies, and a 
multiple dose knee pain study .  These studies show that the adverse event (AE) profile of an 
IBU/APAP combination product at the doses proposed in this document is not materially  
different than the AE profile of the individual mono -components at their maximum dose 
level .10-13

Final Protocol Amendment 6 , 21Sept 2017
Page 221.2.4. Dose Rationale
The dose to be evaluated in this study  is a single oral dose of FDC IBU 250 mg/APAP 
500mg (administered as two caplets of IBU 125 mg/APAP 250 mg).  The anticipated dosing 
interval for the FDC is three times per day , which will provide a maximum daily
 dose of 
750mg IBU/1500 mg APAP. This is well below the current allowe d OTC maximum dose of 
IBU 1200 mg and APAP 4000 mg,respectivel y, as well as the FDA’s Analgesics Advisory  
Committee recommendation of reducing the maximum single adult dose of APAP in OTC 
products from [ADDRESS_857153] in comparison to that of each individual ingredient.
Complete information for this FDC I BU/APAP compound may  be found in the s ingle 
reference safety document (SRSD), which for this study  is the Investigator Brochure (I B).  
The SRSD for the active comparator agents are the I BU (Advil®) IB and the APAP 
(Tylenol®) OTC Drug Facts Label.

3. STUDY DESIGN
This study is a single-center, 8-hours, single-dose, inpatient, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, full-factorial, parallel arm, safety and efficacy study in healthy male subjects 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive). Approximately 290 subjects will be enrolled in this study.
The study is comprised of a screening visit and a study treatment period. The screening visit 
will occur within 28 days prior to the study treatment period.  Subjects will remain at the research center during the study treatment period for approximately 36 hours over 2 days.  Subjects will enter the study center on Day 0 and will remain in-house until after the completion of all study procedures on Day 1, at the investigator’s discretion. Site personnel will conduct a safety follow up within [ADDRESS_857154] occurred.
The night prior to dosing on Day 0, subjects will report to the study site to complete several 
study procedures and will undergo urine and blood testing to ensure they are afebrile, free of occult infection and healthy. Afebrile is defined as a mean oral temperature between 97.4°F and 98.8°F that does not vary by [CONTACT_726] 0.4 F° from the lowest to highest on three repeated assessments during a [ADDRESS_857155]’s fever.  Once subjects have received a dose of RSE, their oral temperature will continue to be monitored at the discretion of the investigator approximately every [ADDRESS_857156] of the following blinded treatments:

The contact [CONTACT_640443]; however, it should be usedonly in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. For sites other than a [COMPANY_007] CRU, the contact [CONTACT_74074], and if a 
subject calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigational site.
5. STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study, and per International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)
guidelines investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33).
5.1. Allocation to Treatment
The investigator will assign subject numbers sequentially as subjects are screened for the 
study.  Subjects will be randomized after they have been administered endotoxin and reached 
an oral temperature of 100.5°F. Treatment assignments will be determined by a computer 
generated randomization schedule, generated and maintained by [CONTACT_640444]. [COMPANY_007] will provide a randomization schedule to the third party person(nel) assigned to prepare and administer the study medication.  Only the third party person(nel) assigned to prepare and administer the study medication will have access to the randomization schedule and dispensing records during the study period. 
The randomization numbers, which are 5-digits, , etc. 
will be used.
In accordance with the randomization numbers, subjects will randomly receive one of the 
study medications listed in Table 1 below, in a 3:3:3:1 ratio.
Study treatments will include single doses of the following medications taken orally:

PF-[ADDRESS_857169] should be prepared and dispensed by [CONTACT_640446] (eg, physician, nurse, physician’s assistant, practitioner, or pharmacist) as allowed by [CONTACT_5737], state, and institutional guidance.
The Sponsor will supply study treatment in bulk and in an un-blinded fashion.  To maintain 
the double-blind status of the study treatments, the following dispensing and dosing procedures will be followed.  The site will identify a qualified third party and alternate(s) who are otherwise not involved in the study and will be responsible for dispensing and administering the study medication and/or RSE.  PCH (Richmond, VA) will provide randomization codes generated by [CONTACT_640447].  A documentation packet consisting of a Study Treatment Dispensing Record and 2-part double-blind labels will be provided to the assigned third party person(nel) only.  The codes will be kept in a secured area with access limited to only the assigned third party dispenser.  Opaque plastic bottles and caps will also be supplied to the third party person(nel). 
The third party dispenser will prepare study medication for each subject in a designated 
dispensing room.  The study coordinator or designee will notify the third party dispenser 
once the subject has reached an oral temperature 100.5 °F.  The third party dispenser will 
assign the next available randomization number to the subject and will dispense the 
appropriate [ADDRESS_857170] will remain in a secure locked area with access limited to the dispenser and the designated alternate(s).  A second qualified individual with no other study involvement will witness the preparation and dispensing process.  No other study person(nel) will be present in the designated dispensing room at the time of study drug dispensing.  No other individuals will be able to see the study drug in the bottle once the bottle cap is closed.  The third party dispenser will inform the study coordinator or designee once the study drug is dispensed and is ready to be administered to the subject.
5.5. Administration
The investigational product will be administered to the subject within [ADDRESS_857171] reaching an oral temperature of 100.5 °F.  Immediately prior to administration of 
study medication, the subject’s oral temperature will be recorded by [CONTACT_640448](nel) and thesubject will be blindfolded. The third party person(nel) will then enter the room and all other blinded study person(nel) will leave.
The third party person(nel) will then give the appropriate study medication to the blindfolded 
subject with approximately 8 ounces of room temperature water (time=0) while they are sitting up.  Subjects will swallow the study medication whole, and will not manipulate or chew the investigational product prior to swallowing.  No blinded study person(nel) will be present at the time of dosing.  The time of dosing will be documented by [CONTACT_640449](nel).

PF-[ADDRESS_857172] administration details will be recorded on the case report form (CRF).
5.6. Investigational Product Storage 
The third party person(nel) will ensure that all investigational products are stored in a secured 
area with controlled access under required storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  Other site person(nel) will ensure that rescue medication, antiemetic, and RSE are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
Investigational product should be stored in its original container and in accordance with the 
label.  Storage conditions stated in the single reference safety document (SRSD) (eg, investigator’s brochure [IB] and OTC Drug Facts Label) will be superseded by [CONTACT_547585].
Site systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products).  This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study.  Even for continuous monitoring systems, a log or site procedure that ensures active daily evaluation for excursions should be available.  The operation of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularly inspected to ensure it is maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions will be reported upon discovery.  
The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage conditions as described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor.  Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be considered a protocol deviation if the sponsor approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to sponsor approval will be considered a protocol deviation.
Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be 
provided to the site.
All materials for this study must be stored in an area free from environmental extremes and 
with restricted access.  A PCH representative will inspect the study product storage area and discuss the study product accountability system with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_640423]. CCI

PF-[ADDRESS_857173] supplies.  All study drugs will be accounted for using a drug accountability form/record. 
The designated third party person(nel), upon dispensing the study treatment, must record the 
information on a study treatment dispensing/return log.  For accounting purposes and assessing subject compliance, a representative of PCH (unblinded monitor) will review the study treatment dispensing/return log, inventory the study treatment, and inspect the storage facility at appropriate time intervals throughout the clinical investigation, depending on the length of the study.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_640424]/or deficiency.
All investigational study treatments shipped for this clinical trial will be returned to the 
Sponsor at the termination of the study.  At the conclusion of the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1075], and a representative of PCH (unblinded monitor) will inventory all used and unused investigational study treatment.  The study treatment inventory record for returned study treatment will then be completed. 
All used investigational product (empty containers), as well as all unused study product will 
then be returned to:
5.7.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational 
product (eg, at the site).   If destruction is authorized to take place at the study site, the 
investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by [CONTACT_4618], and all destruction must be adequately documented.
 
5.9. Concomitant Treatment(s)

Site staff 
willcontinuously  monitor subjects for approximately 60 – 90 minutes
(90minutes if increase in temperature is <1 °F and subject experiences <2 systemic 
symptoms) (Refer to Figure 1and Table 3to determine the subject’s full RSE dose )
to verify  the absence of a medically  significant allergic or exaggerated s ystemic 
response to the endotoxin (as described in Section 7.6). Subjects must remain in a 
semi -recumbent position (45 angle from supi[INVESTIGATOR_640425]).  
Any medically  significant allergic or exaggerated s ystemic responses will 
be recorded on the CRF.
Subject ’s oral temperature (using a standardized electronic, digital thermometer) will 
be documented at 60 or90minutes (90minutes if increase in temperature is <1 °F 
and subject experiences <2 systemic s ymptoms) after receiving the test dose of 
endotoxin to determine the subject’s full dose of RSE. Refer to Figure 1and

[CONTACT_537337]  a certified letter) should be made to contact [CONTACT_423]. All attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_640454]. In any circumstance, every  effort should be made to document 
subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about the reason for 
withdrawal, request that the subject r eturn for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with 
the subject regarding an y unresolved adverse e vents ( AEs).Early Termination procedures, at 
the investigator’s discretion, will include: 
Oral temperature ;

The subject becomes uncooperative or refuses to complete the study  according to the 
study  conditions outlines in this protocol ;
If the subject vomits within 2 hours of taking study treatment ;
If the subject require srescue medication within 1 hour of dosing with study  
treatment ;
If the subject’s temperature does not reach the threshold temperature ;
If the subject does not tolerate endotoxin as described in Section 7.6.
If the subject wi thdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the in vestigator, that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the subject.  When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the 

PF-06438867
B5061002
Final Protocol Amendment 6 , 21Sept 2017
Page 43investigator will document the reason for this and any  corrective and preventive actions that 
he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  fashion.
7.1.Physical Examinations
Physical examinations may beconducted by[CONTACT_134985], trained physician'sassistant, or nurse
practitioner asacceptable according tolocal regulation , timesspecified inSTUDY 
PROCEDURES section ofthisprotocol .  Whenever possible, the same qualified individual
should conduct the phy sical examination sfor any  subject.   
Afull phy sical examination will
include general appearance of the subject, head, ears,eyes,nose,mouth, throat, neck, skin, heart
andl
ungexaminations, lymph node s,abdomen , musculoskeletal, andneurological systems.
Weight and BMI  will be recorded in the CRF . Height will be recorded in the source 
document. The brief ph ysical examination will focus on general appearance, the respi[INVESTIGATOR_640428] s ystems, and subject reported sy mptoms. 
Any untoward findings identified on phy sical exams conducted after the administration of the 
first dose of study  medication will be captured as an adverse event, if those findings meet the 
definition of a n adverse event.
Formeasuring weight, ascale with appropriate range andresolution isused andmustbe
placed on a stable, flatsurface. Subjects m ustremove shoes, bulky layersofclothin g,and
jackets sothatonly light clothing remains. They must alsoremove thecontents oftheir

thisprotocol. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_640431] [ADDRESS_857183] and before blood pressure measurement.
7.4.Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Single , 12-lead ECGs should becollected at timesspecified inSTUDY PROCEDURES
section ofthisprotocol , as well as an y additional times the investigator feels necessary. All
scheduled ECGs should be perform edinasupi[INVESTIGATOR_640432] 10 minutes inasupi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].   For purposes of this study, the QTcF 
correction should be used for QT cassessments.
To ensure safet y of the subjects, a qualified individual at the investigator site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurement col lected on Day  1prior to RSE administration . If the 
QTc interval is increased by  45 msec from the baseline, or an absolute QTc value is 
500msec for an y scheduled ECG, then 2 additional ECGs will be collected, approximatel y 
2-4 minutes apart, to confirm the original measurement.  If either of the QTc values from 
these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value ( 45msec from the baseline; or is 
500
msec), then a single ECG must be repeated at least hourl y until QTc values from 
2successive ECGs fal l below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.
If QTc values remain 500msec (or 45msec from the baseline) for greater than 4 hours (or 
sooner at the discretion of the investigator); or QTc intervals get progressively  longer, the 
subject should undergo continuous ECG monitoring.  A cardiologist should be consulted if 
QTc intervals do not return to less than 500 msec (or to <45 msec above the baseline) after 
8hours of monitoring (or sooner at the discretion of the investigator).
In so me cases, it may  be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  If a mac hine-read QTc 
value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may  not be necessary  if a 
qualified phy sician’s interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the acceptable 
range.
7.5.Laboratory Tests
The following safet y laboratory  tests will b e performed at times defined in the STUDY 
PROCEDURES section of this protocol.  Additional laboratory results may be reported on 
these samples as a result of the method of analy sis or the ty pe of anal yzer used by  [CONTACT_332854] ; or as derived from calculated values.  These additional tests would not require 
additional collection of blood.  Unscheduled clinical labs may  be obtained at any  time during 
the study  to assess any  perceived safety  concerns.

the study .  Upon completion of the study , retained safet y samples may be used for the 
assessment of exploratory  safet y biomarkers; samples to be used for this purpose will 
be packaged and shipped to [COMPANY_007]’s Biobank for storage.  These data will not be

PF-[ADDRESS_857184] dose of endotoxin (0.5 ng/kg body weight) by a qualified 
individual and will then be monitored for approximately 60 – 90 (90 minutes if increase in temperature is <1 °F and subject experiences <2 systemic symptoms) minutes to verify the absence of a medically significant allergic or exaggerated systemic response to the endotoxin. Subjects who tolerate the endotoxin test dose with no more than a moderate cardiovascular response will receive a full dose of endotoxin. Moderate response is defined as a medically significant decrease of mean blood pressure of more than 20% from baseline or an increase in heart rate of more than 50% from baseline or 40 bpm, whichever is less. 
Subjects will then be administered a full dose of RSE at a dose of 1.5 ng/kg, 1 ng/kg or 
0.5 ng/kg as an IV bolus over 30-45 seconds into a forearm vein via an indwelling catheter. Subjects will receive 0.5 ng/kg endotoxin full dose if the subject shows more than a 1
oF oral 
temperature increase (but less than 100.5oF) and/or experiences two or more adverse events 
within approximately [ADDRESS_857185] dose. Subjects who do not show more than a 1
oF oral temperature increase and/or do not experience two or more adverse events 
within approximately [ADDRESS_857186] dose will be monitored for an additional 30 minutes. After the additional 30 minutes of monitoring (90 minutes in total) subjects will be administered a 1 ng/kg of full dose endotoxin if they show more than a 1
oF increase in 
oral temperature (but less than 100.5oF) and/or experience two or more adverse events. 
Subjects who do not show a more than a 1oF oral temperature increase and/or do not 
experience two or more adverse events within approximately [ADDRESS_857187] dose will be administered a 1.5 ng/kg dose of endotoxin. (See Figure 1 for an 
algorithm on determining the full dose of RSE). At any time after administration of endotoxin before randomization, subject will not be randomized if he develops two or more systemic RSE-related adverse events where both are rated as severe.
Subjects whose oral temperature does not reach 100.5
oF (after 60 – 90 minutes of
additional monitoring) after administration of the full endotoxin dose may be administered an 
additional 1 ng/kg bolus dose of endotoxin at the discretion of the investigator (Subject’s vitals will be taken and rec orded immedia tely prior to receiving the additional dose of RSE). 
Subject’s temperature will then be monitored approximately every 5 minutes and 
documented in the source document until their oral temperature reaches 100.[ADDRESS_857188].
Site staff will continuously monitor subjects to verify the absence of a medically significant 
allergic or exaggerated systemic response to the endotoxin and observe for signs and symptoms of endotoxemia (ie, chills, fever, h eadache, body  aches, hypotension, etc.).  The 
onset of these symptoms will generally occur approximately 1-2 hours after RSEadministration and usually begins with transient chills, followed shortly thereafter by [CONTACT_640455]-like symptoms over the next 4-6 hours.

Page 477.7.Temperature Recording/Monitoring
During Screening and on Day  0,an oral temperature will be obtained from each subject
(using a standardized electronic, digital thermometer) to ensure they  are afebrile .Afebrile is 
defined as a mean temperature between 97.4°F and 98.8°F that does not vary more than 
0.4 Ffrom the lowest to highest on three repeated assessments within a [ADDRESS_857189]’s fever . At the 
discretion of the investigator, additional oral temperatures will be taken more frequentl y to 
monitor the subject’s oral temperature .If the subject’s temperature exceeds 102.5oFsubjects 
may receive rescue medication.  All endpoints for this study  will be based on oral 
temperature measurements via a standardized electronic, digital thermometer. 
Oral temperatures will be recorded at the following times: 
At screening and Day  0 to ensure the subjects are afebrile and eligible to participate 
in the study ;
Prior to administration of the test dose of RSE. This will be referred to as the
“normal ”temperature ;
Approximately  60and 90 minutes (90minutes if increase in temperature <1°Fand 
subject experiences <2 systemic sy mptoms) after the test dose of RSE in order to 
determine what full dose of RSE the subject will receive (see 
Section 7.6 above for RSE dosing).  After approximately  60 or 90 min(90min if 
increase in temperature <1°F and subject experienc es <2 systemic s ymptoms) of 
receiving the test dose of RSE, subjects who tolerate the test dose of RSE will receive 
a full dose of RSE ;
After the full dose of RSE when the subject has reached an oral 
temperature 
100.5°F. The subject’s oral temperature wi ll need to be 100.5° F in order to be 
randomized to study  medication.  If the subject’s oral temperature is not 100.5°F, 
additional oral temperature measurements will be taken approximatel yevery 
5minutes and recorded in the source document until the sub ject reaches this 
temperature
or is given an additional dose of RSE. The time between the subject 
reaching an oral temperature of 100.5F and being dosed should not exceed 
10minutes
;
Immediately  prior to study  medication dosing after the subject has rea ched an oral 
temperature of100.5 °F and has been randomized. This will be referred to as the 
“baseline ”temperature ;
At 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, [ADDRESS_857190] dose .  The following time windows 
will be allowed for each of the time points; the widths of ±3 minutes for time points 
that are 10 minutes apart, ±5 minutes for time points that are 30 minutes apart .

Page 48At the discretion of the investigator, additional oral temperatures may be taken by [CONTACT_640456]’s 
oral temperature.  If the subject’s temperature exceeds 102.5oF, subjects may receive 
rescue medication.  An oral temperature will be taken and recorded prior to rescue medication administration.
Subjects will remain in bed during the times of temperature measurements. The investigator 
or delegated site staff members will continuously monitor the subject’s oral temperature using a standardized, digital thermometer. If this temperature exceeds 102.[ADDRESS_857191](s) will be reported as described in the following sections. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event (SAE) requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.  For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_4683].  The investigator is required to assess causality.  Follow-up by [CONTACT_4684] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_857192] 
in the determination of case seriousness ,further information may  be requested from the 
investi gator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
All AEs believed b y the investigator to be related to endotoxin will be marked as of “other” 
causality  in the AE page of the CRF.  Investigators are advised to enter that the AE is due to 
endotoxin in the causality description of “other” .
8.2.Reporting Period
For 
SAE s, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the subject provides informed consent, which is obtain ed prior to the subject’s 
participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through and including 14calendar day s after the last 
administration of the investigational product.  SAEs occurring to a subject after the active 
reporting period has ended should be reported to the 
sponsor if the investigator becomes 
aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a 
reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the 
sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the c ase report f orm ( CRF )from the 
time the subject has taken at least 1dose of investigational product through the subject ’slast 
visit.   AEs and SAEs related to endotoxin should be reported on the CRF from the time the 
subject has been administered the test dose of endotoxin.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administere d a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in phy sical e xamination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;

B5061002
Final Protocol Amendment 6 , 21Sept 2017
Page 50Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravas ation;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ;
Exposure via breastfeeding ;
Medication error ;
Occupational e xposure.
8.4.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product , by [CONTACT_1148], a t the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF ,which is a specific version of the AE page ,and on the SAE form when 
appropriate.  In the event of m edication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error iscaptured on the medication error version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page. If there are errors 
related to endotoxin, they will be captured as a protocol deviation.
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention ;
and/or

PF-06438867
B5061002
Final Protocol Amendment 6 , 21Sept 2017
Page 51Test result lea ds to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y;and/or
Test result is considered to b e an AEby [CONTACT_4687].
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the ab sence of any  of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.6.Serious Adverse Events
Aserious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to cond uct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such even ts are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There a re no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements). 
Endotoxin -related adverse events will be recorded in the AE section of the CRF as of “other” 
causality  and that the AE is due to endotoxin in the causalit y description of “other”.

Page 528.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal valu es in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential c ases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s law cases) and should alway s be considered 
important medical events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T values 3times the upper limit of 
normal (×ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value  2 ×ULN with no evidence 
of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value 2 ×ULN or not avai lable ;
For subjects with preexisting AL TOR AST OR total bilirubin values above the 
ULN , the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned 
above:
For subjects with pre existing AST or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range: AST o
r ALT values 2times the baseline values and 3 ×ULN, or 
8 ×ULN (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with
For subjects with pre existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin level increased from baseline by  [CONTACT_640457]1 ×ULN or
if the value reaches ≥3×ULN (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_857193] bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl 
transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/ international no rmalized ratio ( INR), and alkaline 
phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, 
acetaminophen , recreational drug ,and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational 
exposure, sexual history , travel hist ory, history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person , surgery , 
blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  
Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging ( eg, biliary  tract) 
may be warranted.
  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria 
defined above , with no other cause for Liver Function Test ( LFT
)abnormalities identified at 
the time ,should be considered potential Hy ’s law cases irrespective of availability  of all the 
results of the investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnor mal L FTs.  Such 
potential Hy ’s law cases should be reported as SAEs.

includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit ( eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coron ary care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] ( eg,caregiver relief);

Nursing homes;
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
AEis not in itself a nSAE .  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AEor with a worsening of the preexisting condition ( eg, for 
work up of persistent pretreatment lab oratory abnormality );
Social admission ( eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission ( eg,for yearly physical exam ination );
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg,for a procedure requ ired by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg,for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures .  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject .

PF-06438867
B5061002
Final Protocol Amendment 6 , 21Sept 2017
Page 54Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as 
AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.8.Severity Assessment
If required on the AECRFs , the investigator will use the adjectives M ILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes 
of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interf ere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE .  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAE s, listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relations hip should be 
provided
.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the sponsor (see the s ectio n on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causalit
y assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product ," 
this should be clearl y documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that anSAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure D uring Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products , an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:

PF-06438867
B5061002
Final Protocol Amendment 6 , 21Sept 2017
Page 551. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed ( eg, because of treatment or environmenta l exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product.
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a Pfiz erproduct in a pregnant woman ( eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male has been exposed ( eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a stud y subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] drug safet y unit on an SAE report 
form and an EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregna nt woman ( eg, a 
subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_8897][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP s upplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of t he exposure.  The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP repor ts with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow-up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural int egrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual i nspection (unless pre -procedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE ( ie,ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neo natal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are repo rted as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_857194].

PF-06438867
B5061002
Final Protocol Amendment 6 , 21Sept 2017
Page 56Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by  [CONTACT_093].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case -by-case basis (eg, follow - up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that 
the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner .
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when ,during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE r eport form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF ; however ,a cop y of the completed SAE r eport form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also the Section on Subject Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
accordin g to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AECRF 
page. 
When a subject withdraws because of an SAE , the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
Theinvestigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  subject .  In addition, each study  subject will be questioned about AEs.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the crite ria for 
SAE s.  If a nSAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If anSAE occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_857195] be made 
immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AE information.  This time frame also 
applies to additional new information (follow
-up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of EDP ,exposure via breastfeeding ,and 
occupational exposure cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a nSAE
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_857196] awareness of the AE.
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  
This i nformation collected for SAE sismore detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF .  In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/orillnesses, must be provided.  In the c ase of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.14.2. Nons erious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AECRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.14.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AEreporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be carr ied out in 
accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for the summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this 
study  are outlined here and further detailed in a Statistical Analy sis Pl an (SAP), which will 
bemaintained b y the sponsor.  
The SAP may  modify  what is outlined in the protocol where 
appropriate ; however, any  major modifications to the primary  endpoint definition sand/or 
their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amend
ment.
[COMPANY_007] Consumer Healthcare will perform statistical anal yses of data.  All computati ons will 
be performed using SAS®version 9.2 or higher (SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC).  Statistically  
significant treatment differences will be declared if the probability of random occurrence 
among or between treatments, p, is  0.05 (two sided).  Treatment differences will be 
considered marginally  significant if 0.05<p 0.10.  All tests will be two sided.

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 21 Sept 2017
Page 589.1. Sample Size Determination
The sample size calculation was based on the data from a previous induced fever study 
(Whitehall-Robins Protocol Number ED-93-03).  In that study, subjects with normal body temperature took study medication 30 minutes prior to receiving Endotoxin. The estimated variability (root mean square error RMSE) of the weighted sum of temperatures difference over 0-[ADDRESS_857197] and variability for sample size.
In this study, we assume a treatment difference of 1.77 and 1.88 units in WSTD0-8 for 
APAP/IBU vs IBU and APAP/IBU vs. APAP, respectively, and a variability (RMSE) of 3.406.  A sample of 78 subjects per active treatment group will be required to provide about 85% joint power to achieve statistical significance at two-sided 0.05 level.  Furthermore, this sample size for each active group and 26 subjects in placebo group (3:3:3:1 allocation ratio)will provide about 85% power to detect a treatment difference of 2.35 units in WSTD0-8 for the comparison of each active treatment to placebo. 
Thus, after adjusting for additional 3.7% who are randomized but not dosed or with no 
post-baseline data, a total of approximately 270 subjects are to be randomized into the study.  All statistical tests will be performed at a two-sided 0.05 level of significance.
Additional 20 subjects (two randomization blocks) will be randomized.  This addition 
ensures a total of approximately 270 subjects in the modified Intent to treat (mITT) analyses population which will include only subjects randomized after protocol amendment 4.  Seventeen subjects (replaced by [CONTACT_640437] 20 subjects) not included in the mITT were dosed with a different RSE dosing algorithm than the RSE current dosing algorithm before amendment 4.  These subjects were dosed with much higher test and full doses of endotoxin.
9.2. Efficacy Analysis
The statistical analysis methods will be detailed in the SAP, and are briefly summarized 
below. Subjects will be assigned to the randomized treatment group for efficacy summary and analysis regardless of the treatment received.
9.2.1. Primary Analysis Set
The primary analysis set is the modified intent to treat (mITT) subject population, defined as 
all randomized subjects who were dosed with the study medication and RSE per procedures specified in protocol post amendment 4 and had a baseline assessment.

9.2.4. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint
The primary efficacy endpoint, the weighted sum of temperature difference from baseline 
over 0-8 hours (WSTD0-8) will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment groupterm and covariates baseline temperature and time from the first RSE full dose to randomization using mITT.  Additional analyses will be conducted based on the ITT analysis set.
Time from the first RSE full dose to randomization is added to the model as subjects 
demonstrated significant variations in time from RSE first full dose to randomization (ie,reaching threshold temperature of 100.5).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Protection for Multiple Comparisons
In order for the study to be deemed successful, the combination product should be 
significantly better than both active comparators for the primary endpoint. The type 1 error for the primary endpoint will be preserved by [CONTACT_640458] 0.05 level of significance (two-sided) in the following order:
1. IBU/APAP vs placebo;
2. IBU/APAP vs IBU and IBU/APAP vs APAP;3. IBU vs placebo;4. APAP vs placebo;5. IBU vs APAP.
1. A comparison will not be eligible for being declared significant unless the one 
preceding it is also significant.
2. All pairwise comparisons will be presented for the sake of clinical completeness 
even if they are not technically eligible for being declared significant.
9.2.5. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
All measures relating to weighted sum of temperature difference from baseline, temperature 
difference from baseline at individual post-dose time point will be analyzed by [CONTACT_640459].  Additional analyses may be conducted based on the ITT analysis set.CCI

The safet y analysis set comprises all subjects who dosed with study  medication.  Subjects 
will be anal yzed according to the treatment they  received, regardless of the randomized 
treatment assigned.
Adverse eve nt (AE) analy ses will include all events which initially  occurred, or worsened 
following treatment.  Adverse events will be summarized by  [CONTACT_640460] ( MedDRA )system organ class (SOC) and preferred term and classified 
according to their severity  (mild, moderate, or severe) and relationship (related or not related) 
to study  product.  For the summary  by [CONTACT_11370] y, subjects who have multiple occurrences of 
the same AE will be classified according to the worst reported severit y of the AE.  Similarly , 
for the summary  by [CONTACT_471863], the AE will be classified according to 
the worst relationship.
Safety  (adverse events [ AE]/serious adverse events [ SAE ]) data will be summariz ed by  
[CONTACT_6660]. 
Non-treatme nt emergent AEs will be summarized.
Post-treatment vital signs and their change from baseline values will be summarized by  
[CONTACT_6660]. Number and percent of subjects with an abnormal ECG exam at the end of 
the study  will be summarized by  [CONTACT_3148] g roups. 
9.5.Data Monitoring Committee 
This study  will not use a data monitoring c ommittee.
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
[COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study  conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Pra ctices ( GCPs
)are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs areaccurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities d irect access to source documents to perform this verification.   This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.
During study  conduct and/or after study  completion, t
he study  site may  be subject to review 
by [CONTACT_941] i nstitutional review board (I RB)/ ethics committee (EC), and/or to quality  assurance 
audits performed b y [COMPANY_007], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to 
inspection by
 [CONTACT_47615].
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately of an y regulatory inspection 
notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the study  site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its agent, 
whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator will promptly  
provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_4599].  Before response submission 
to the regulatory  authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an 
opportunity  to review an d comment on responses to any  such findings.

PF-06438867
B5061002
Final Protocol Amendment 6 , 21Sept 2017
Page 62It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLI NG AND RECORD KEEPIN G
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate reg ulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y
,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
document s) and ensuring that they  are accurate, authentic /original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring , and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_36551]. Any correcti ons to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases , the source documents are the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In 
these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available a t the investigat ivesite as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or Pfi zer, the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, eg,CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety  reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local 
regulations, or as specified in the c linical study agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, reloc ation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be k ept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_857198] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirem ents have been met.

PF-[ADDRESS_857199]/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg,
recru itment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator f ile.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the St udy
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical

or other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where
required b y law.
When study  data 
arecompi[INVESTIGATOR_47581], s ubject 
name s, address es, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y a numerical code based on a 
numbering sy stem provided by  [CONTACT_47617] -ident ify study  subject s . The study  site 
will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the study ,linking each 
subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity .  In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will 
maintain high standards of confiden tiality and protection of subjects’ personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document smust be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and legal requirements , including applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document s used during the informed consent process must be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_456], approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC before use , and available for 
inspection.
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject is fully  informed about th e nature and 
objectives of the stud y and possible risks associated with participation.

12.4. Subject Recruitment
Advertisements approved by  [CONTACT_1202]/ECs and investigator databases may  be used as 
recruitment procedures.
[COMPANY_007] will have an opportunity  to review and approve the content of any  study  recruitment 
materials directed to potential s tudy subjects before such materials are used. 
12.5. Reporting of S
afety Issues and S erious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed ( ie,clinical hold) b y an applicable 
competent authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately . 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study subjects against an y immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.

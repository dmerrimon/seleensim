SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209568
Protocol Title: A Study of Nivolumab in Combination with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Part 1); and Nivolumab plus 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_501652] (Part 2) as First Line Therapy in Stage IV Non-Small Cell 
Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administr ation, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Part 1: Nivolumab administered IV over 30 minutes at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_501653] 30 minutes at 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons 
specified in the protocol. Treatment with nivolumab and ip ilimumab will be given for a maximum of 2 years from the 
start of study treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Part 2 Schema for Safety Lead-in:
The safety lead-in phase will be conducted to evaluate safe dose level: approximately 28 subjects (in order to achieve 
at least 22 DLT evaluable subjects) will receive 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy and nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The starting dose of nivolumab is 360mg every 3 weeks and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. 
‘Safe’ is defined as 25% evaluated subjects or less exhibit DLTs (ie, 5 or less subjects with such events out of 22 DLT 
evaluable subjects).
A safety assessment will be performed on the fi rst 10 subjects after a minimum of 9 weeks of follow- up. If 20% or 
less of the first 10 subjects exhibit DLTs (ie, 2 or less subjects with such events), the regimen is determined safe and 
enrollment in subsequent studies using this combinati on may start while the safety lead in phase of CA209568 is 
ongoing. If more than 20% of the first 10 subjects exhibit DLTs, the full safety cohort will be evaluated prior to using this dose regimen in subsequent studies. If more than 25% of the overall DLT evaluable subjects exhibit DLTs, the 
protocol may be amended to evaluate different dose levels, depending on the toxicities observed.
After above 2 cycles of indu ction treatment, nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_501659], withdrawal of consent, or for a max imum of 2 years from the start of study treatment in in the 
absence of disease progression or inacceptable toxicity. 
Study Population: Subjects must meet all eligibility criteria specified in Section 3.3 of the protocol, including the 
following:Key inclusion criteria include:
•Male and female subjects (≥ 18 years of age).
•Subjects with histol ogically confirmed stage IV NSCLC (per the 7th International Association for the St udy of 
Lung Cancer classification) squamous or non-squamous histology.
•No prior systemic therapy for stage IV disease. Prior definitive chemoradiation for lo cally advanced disease is 
permitted as long as the last administration of chemotherapy or radiotherapy (which ever was given last) occurred 
at least 6 months prior to enrollment. Locally advanced disease with recurrence after concurrent chemoradiation 
therapy (stage IIIB, specifically refers to patients with no curative treatment options) is eligible to enroll. Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early stage lung cancer is permitted if completed at least 6 months 
before initiating study treatment. 
•EGFR/ALK wild type, and ECOG PS 0 or 1
•Subjects are to have tumor tissue sample available at cen tral lab for PD -L1 IHC testing during the screening 
period.
•Measurable disease by [CONTACT_251586] 1.1 criteria
Subjects in safety lead in phase may initiate therapy before the result of IHC testing once the central lab has confirmed receiving of samples.

Either a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block or unstained tumor tissue sections, with an associated 
pathology report, must be submitted for biomarker evalu ation prior to treatment. The tumor tissue sample may be 
fresh or archival if obtained within 6 months prior to Pa rt 1 enrollment (archival tissue is to be obtained within 
3 months prior to Part 2 enrollment), and there can have  been no systemic therapy (eg. adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy) given after the sample was obtained. 
Tissue samples must be collected by a core needle biopsy, ex cisional or incisional biopsy. Fine needle biopsies or 
drainage of pleural effusions with cytospi[INVESTIGATOR_501660] c onsidered adequate for biomarker review. Biopsies of bone 
lesions that do not have a soft tissue component or decalcified bone tumor samples are also not acceptable. 
Key Exclusion Criteria

not limited to, deletions in exon 19 and exon 21 [L858R] substitution mutations) are excluded. All subjects with non-squamous histology must have been tested for EGFR mutation status. EGFR test is to be done locally. Use 
of an FDA-approved or local Health Authority approved test i s strongly encouraged. Tests other than PCR or next 
generation sequencing will be requested to repeat us ing PCR or next generation sequencing based method. 
Subjects with non-squamous histology with unknown or indeterminate EGFR status are excluded.
•Subjects with known ALK translocations which are sensitive to available targeted inhibitor therapy are excluded. ALK tests are to be done at local lab and use of a FDA-approved test is strongly encouraged. S ubjects with 
unknown or indeterminate ALK status may be enrolled.

1.2 Research Hypothesis 
Part 1: In
 subjects with PD-L1positive (membranous staining in ≥1% tumor cells) and negative 
(membranous staining in < 1% tumor cells) stage IV NSCLC, the administration of nivolumab in 
combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_501662] w ill lead to clinical benef it as demonstrated 
by a clinically meaningful objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response.
In individual patient data meta-analysis of 2968 pa tients suggests that cisplatin or carboplatin 
based chemotherapy has response rate of 30% (cis platin based chemo) or 24% (carboplatin based 
chemo).25Clinically meaningful objective res ponse rate is defined as higher than 30% which is 
the ORR of cisplatin based standard of care chemotherapy, and/or considerably longer duration of 
response.

Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_52194].
All potential serious breaches must be reported to BMS immediately. A serious breach is a breach 
of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant d egree, the safety or physical or me ntal integrity of the subjects of 
the study or the scientific value of the study.
Personnel involved in conducting this st udy will be qu alified by [CONTACT_8640], traini ng, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.
This study will not use the services of study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where 
there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment). 
2.[ADDRESS_646282]/Independent Ethics Committee 
Before study initiation, the investigator must ha ve written and dated approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_20291]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment materials 
(eg, advertisements), and any other written informati on to be provided to subjects. The investigator 
or BMS should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigator Brochure or product 
labeling information to be provided to subjects and any updates. 
The investigator or BMS should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other information 
(eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to regulatory 
requirements or institution procedures.
2.[ADDRESS_646283] ensure that subjects are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate. 
In situations where consent cannot be given to  subjects, their legally acceptable representatives 
(as per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed a bout the purpose, po tential risks, and 
other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject volunteers to participate. 
BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Lo cal) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements required by [CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The sample informed consent form w ill adhere to th e ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.Investigators must:A. Provide a copy of the consent form and written information about the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily understood. 
B. Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally acceptable representative to inquire about 
the details of the study.
C. Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_29159]'s legally 
acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_28490].

D. Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_82705], prior to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.
E. If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating his or her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the subject.
F. Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully i nform the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the subject's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be 
documented. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects must be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the subjects' signed ICF a nd, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory authorities have direct 
access to subject records. 
Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or subjects with or severe dementia) may 
only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acceptable representative. The subject must also be informed about the nature of th e study to the extent compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or she should personally sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The exp licit wish of a s ubject who is unable to give his or 
her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_120975], or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time s hould be considered by 
[CONTACT_093].
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study s ubjects are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
Adults (≥18 years) male and female subjects, with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, previously 
untreated for advanced disease are eligible for enrollment, irrespectively of PD-L1 expressi on. 
Subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_4002]-L1 expression, and categorized into 4 groups (PD-L1 positive, 
PD-L1 ≥50%, PD-L1 negative, and PD-L1 not quantifiable). PD-L1 status will be determined by 
[CONTACT_501709]-L1 IHC 28-[ADDRESS_646284] for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of PD-L1 protein 
in the submitted tumor sample.
•PD-L1 positive ( ≥1% tumor cell mem brane staining in a minimum of a h undred evaluable 
tumor cells) 
•PD-L1 ≥50% (≥50% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of a hundred evaluable 
tumor cells) and is a subset of all PD-L1 positive subjects.

•PD-L1 negative (< 1% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of a hundred evaluable 
tumor cells)
•PD-L1 not quantifiable (subjects with tumor biopsy specimens without quantifiable PD-L1 
expression)
Throughout both parts of the study, subjects are to  have tumor tissue sample available for PD-L1 
IHC testing performed by [CONTACT_501710]. In part 1, subjects can initiate 
therapy before the result of IHC testing. PD-L1 test will be used to track PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 
negative treated subjects. Subjects in safety lead  in phase may initiate ther apy before IHC result. 
Part [ADDRESS_646285] 120 PD-L 1 positive and 100 PD-L1 negative subjects are 
treated, whichever comes later (Part 1 enrollmen t target was reached on Nov. 15 2016. Future 
enrollment will be in Part 2 study).
For the Part 2 safety lead in, only receipt of suitable tissue by [CONTACT_501711]. 3.1.1 Study design

A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed.  
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
•Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is  
elected. 
•WOCBP participants who choose complete abstin ence must continue to have pregnancy  
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the  
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence 
NOTES: 
aTypi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent  
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptiv e methods for participants participating in clinical studies.  
bHormonal contraception may be sus ceptible to interaction with the st udy drug, which may reduce the efficacy  
of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence that  
the IMP and other study med ications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception would be  
ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative methods  
of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the  
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when ho rmone exposures from intrau terine devices do not alter  
contraception effectiveness
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception*
•Male or female condom with or without spermicide.  Male and female condoms cannot be 
used simultaneously
•Diaphragm with spermicide
•Cervical cap with spermicide
•Vaginal Sponge with spermicide
•Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, wh ere inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mechanism of action
•Periodic abstinence (calendar, symp tothermal, post- ovulation methods)
•Withdrawal (coitus interruptus).

•Creatinine clearance (CrCl) calculation is based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula (see Inclusion 
criterion 2f in Section 3.3.1 ) and should include the most recent serum creatinine and most 
recent weight. NOTE: If calculation of the CrCl by [CONTACT_16424]-Gault formula yields a result of > 125 mL/min, then a CrCl should be calculated by [CONTACT_501720] 125 mL/min. 
•The dose of carboplatin may be capped per local standards.
Premedications for use with carboplatin: may be employed at the discretion of the Investigator.
Carboplatin is to be administered after paclitaxel.

4.5.2 Dose Delay Criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Delay Criteria for Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_501677].
Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102326]:
•Any Grade ≥ 2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, except for fatigue and laboratory 
abnormalities
•Any Grade ≥3 skin drug-related AE
•Any Grade ≥[ADDRESS_646339], ALT, or total bilirubin or asymptomatic amylase or lipase:
−Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require a dose delay
−If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin that is within normal limits, delay 
dosing for drug-related Grade 2 toxicity
−If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity range, 
delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥3 toxicity
−Any Grade ≥ 3 drug-related amylas e or lipase abnorm ality that is not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis does not require dose delay. The BMS 
Medical Monitor should be consulted for such Grade ≥3 amylase or lipase abnormalities.
−Any AE, laboratory  abnormality or inter-current illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication.
•Subjects receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_501678]-related toxicities 
that meet the criteria for dose delay, should have both drugs (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762]) 
delayed until retreatment cr iteria are met. (Exceptions apply to the retreatment criteria after 
dose delay of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45763] ≥3 amylase and lipase abnormalities that 
are not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and that are 
attributed to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165].)
Rescheduling:
•Nivolumab may be delayed until the next pla nned ipi[INVESTIGATOR_501679] 12 days. This will permit periodic ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102329].
•Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] s hould be dosed at the sp ecified interval regardless of any delays in intervening 
nivolumab doses. However, in order to maintain periodic synchronized dosing of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102330], the dosing days of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102331] +/- [ADDRESS_646340] 12 days 
apart. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102332] 5 day window if needed to synchronize with the next nivolumab dose.
•If an ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102333] 6 weeks from the prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102334], then subsequent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102336] s hould rescheduled to maintain the 6 week interval between 
consecutive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102336]. 
•A dose delay of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102337] > 12 weeks requires

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Delay Criteria for Chemotherapy
In Part 2, chemotherapy drugs should be delayed for any of the following on the Day 1 of each 
cycle:
•Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/μL
•Platelets < 100,000/mm3
•Any Grade ≥ 2 non-skin, non-hematologic, drug-related adverse event (excluding Grade 2 
alopecia, Grade 2 fatigue, and Grade 2 laboratory abnormalities)
•Any Grade ≥3 skin, drug-related adverse event
•Any Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_646341], ALT, or total bilirubin:
•Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require dose delay.
•If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT or total bilir ubin that is within normal limits, delay dosing 
for drug-related Grade ≥2 toxicity. 
•If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity range, delay 
dosing for drug-related Grade ≥3 toxicity. 
•Any adverse event, laboratory abnorm ality, or interc urrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication. Investigators should consult 
local labeling for the chemotherapy drugs being administered to any given subject for additional guidance on dose delays.
In addition, if subjects receiving carboplatin with paclitaxel and must discontinue carboplatin, the 
paclitaxel may be continued at the investigator’s discretion. If a ny non-hematologic adverse event 
meeting the dose delay criteria above is felt to be related to only one particular agent in the 
platinum doublet chemotherapy regimen, then that agent alone may be omitted for that cycle while 
the other agent is given. In order to maintain synchronized dosing of the regimen, the omitted agent should be resumed with the next scheduled cycle once the AE has improved and retreatment 
criteria are met. Please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] to determine if dose reduction of the resumed agent 
is required.
If both drugs in the platinum doublet chemotherapy regimen are delayed, then the subject should 
be re-evaluated weekly or more frequently if  clinically indicated until re -treatment cr iteria are met 
(as per Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Part 2 safety lead in : If any adverse event meeting the dose delay criteria for chemotherapy is felt 
to be related to only one particular agent in the platinum doublet chemotherapy regimen, then that 
chemotherapy agent alone may be omitted for that cy cle wh ile the other agents (nivolumab and 
one chemotherapy agent) are given. Dosing of nivolumab and both chemotherapy agents should 
be delayed if criteria for nivolumab or “both platinum-doublet chemotherapy agents” are met. 
Therefore nivolumab and chemotherapy can be given as combination.

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Reduction for Chemotherapy in Part 2
Dose reductions of chemotherapy may be required, and will be performed according to Table
[IP_ADDRESS]-1 . Chemotherapy dose reductions are permanent; once the dose of any chemotherapy agent 
is reduced, it may not be re-escalated in subsequent cycles, except as noted when starting 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy. The dose redu ctions for each agent in the platinum doublet 
chemotherapy regimen are not linked and may be adjusted independently as summarized below.

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Reductions for Hematologic Toxicity 
Dose modifications for hematologic toxicities (according to CTCAE version 4) are summarized in 
Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 . Dose adjustments are based on nadir blood counts (assessed as per local standards) 
since the preceding drug administration. Dose level adjustments for platinum doublet chemotherapy are relative to that of the preceding administration. Generally, both chemotherapy 
agents in the platinum doublet chemotherapy re gimen should be  dose reduced together for 
hematologic toxicity. After the first cycle, growth factors may be used to assist hematologic 
recovery. Use local standards of care in th e use of these supportive measures. Additionally, 
prophylactic antibiotics may be used according to local standards of care. Please report any antibiotic or growth factor use on the eCRF.

of Grade [ADDRESS_646344]/ALT OR total bilirubin.
•Subjects with combined Grade [ADDRESS_646345]/ALT and total bilirubin values meeting discontinuation 
parameters (Section 4.5.5 ) should have treatment permanently discontinued.
•Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline before treatment is resumed. Subjects with persistent Grade [ADDRESS_646346] 1 month may be eligible for retreatment if discussed with and 
approved by [CONTACT_102440].
•Subjects who received systemic corticosteroids  for management of any drug-related toxicity 
must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an equivalent dose of prednisone 
≤10 mg/day.
•Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately c ontrolled with only physiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment.
•Subjects who delay study treatment due to any Grade ≥3 amylase or lipase abnormality that is 
not associated with symptoms or clinical manifes tations of pancreatitis, and that is assessed by 
[CONTACT_482543][INVESTIGATOR_482503], may resume nivolumab 
when the amylase or lipase abnormality has resolved to Grade < 3. The BMS Medical Monitor 
should be consulted prior to resuming nivolumab in such subjects.

•In general, subjects who meet criteria to re sume ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102349], so it should be feasible to synchronize dosing of both drugs when resuming ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. In order to fac ilitate this, the dosing days of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_104013] +/- [ADDRESS_646350] 12 days apart.
•One exception to note is when ipi[INVESTIGATOR_501682]-
related Grade ≥3 amylase or lipase abnormalities not associated with symptoms or clinical 
manifestations of pancreatitis. If th e investigator assesses the Grade ≥3 amylase or lipase 
abnormality to be related to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102352], nivolumab may be 
resumed when the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to Grade < [ADDRESS_646351]’s medical chart. The BMS Medical Monit or should be consulted  prior to resuming 
nivolumab in such subjects.
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria to Resume Treatment with Chemotherapy 
•Subjects may resume treatment with chemotherapy when the ANC returns to 1500/ μl, the 
platelet count ret urns to 100,000/mm3, and all other drug-related toxicities have returned to 
baseline or Grade 1 (or Grade 2 for alopecia and fatigue).
•If a subject fails to meet criteria for re-treatment, then re-treatment should be delayed, and the 
subject should be re-evaluated weekly or more frequently as clinically indicated. Any subject who fails to recover from toxicity attributable to chemotherapy to baseline or Grade 1 (except 
Grade 2 alopecia and fatigue) within [ADDRESS_646352] dose given should discontinue the 
drug(s) that caused the delay.

4.5.5 Treatment Discontinuation Criteria
For all subjects, global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time s hould be reported as ‘symptomatic 
deterioration’ in the source data and in the case report form. Tumor assessments for subjects who 
discontinue study treatment without radi ographic progression, confirmed by [CONTACT_501721] ( Section 7.2 ), should continue as per protoc ol until radiographic progression is 
determined by [CONTACT_19375].
Part 2: If a subject is intolerant of nivolumab treatment during the chemotherapy cycles, the 
subject should be withdrawn from the study.Chemotherapy dose reduction is allowed on study. Any subject with two prior dose reductions to 
one agent who experiences a toxicity that would cause a third dose reduction must be discontinued 
from that agent. A subject in treatment arm who is discontinued from the chemotherapy treatment will remain on the study and r eceive nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_501683] p emetrexed

the Time and Events Schedule on Table 5.1-2 and Table 5.1-3 .
For the subjects who continue study therapy beyond progression, further progression is defined as 
an additional 10% increase in tumor burden with a minimum of 5 mm absolute increase from time 
of initial PD. This includes an increase in the sum of d iameters of all target lesions and/ or the 
diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial PD. Nivolumab and

New lesions are considered  measureable at th e time of init ial progression if the longest diameter 
is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of initial progression may 
become measureable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases 
to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to 
inclusion of new lesions which become measurable, these new lesions must demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms: (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated)
•Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are r ecommended for future i nfusions: diphe nhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_646380] 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45782].
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction requ ires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, cortico steroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; 
prophylactic medications indicated for ≤≤24 hours)
•Stop the nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182], begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and tr eat 
the subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV  (or equivalent) a nd/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 
325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of the original infusion r ate when 
symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion r ate. Monitor subject clos ely. If symptoms recur, 
then no further nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_501699]. Administer 
diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_646381] be recorded on the el ectronic case report

•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) a nd/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_646382] 30 minutes before nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45784]. If 
necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of SoluCortef or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_77984]/or brief int erruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms 
following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138] [eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: Life threatening; pressor or ventilatory support indicated)
•Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Begin an IV infusion of normal 
saline and treat the subject as follows: Reco mmend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg

5.3 Safety Assessments
At b
aseline, a medical history will be ob tained to capture relevant underlying conditions. The 
baseline examinations  should include weight, height, ECOG Pe rformance Status, blood pressure 
(BP), heart rate (HR), and temperature at rest, and should be performed within [ADDRESS_646402] dose through 
the study treatment period (see Section 5.1 ).
Baseline local laboratory assessments should be done within [ADDRESS_646403] dose and are to 
include: CBC w/differential, LFTs (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase), BUN or 
serum urea level, creatinine, albumin, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, phosphate, LDH, glucose, amylase, 
lipase, Thyroid function tests includes TSH, free T4, and free T3.
The following baseline local laboratory assessments should be done within [ADDRESS_646404] 
treatment: Hepatitis B and C testing (HBV sAg and HCV Ab or HCV RNA).
Pregnancy testing for WOCBP (done locally) must be  performed within 24 hours prior to the Day 1 
at baseline and then every 4 weeks (2 cycles) ±[ADDRESS_646405] be within 24 hours

While on-study the following local laboratory assessm ents are to be done within 3 days prior to 
each dose: CBC with differential, LFTs (ALT,  AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase), BUN 
or serum urea level, creatinine, albumin, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, phosphate, LDH, glucose, amylase, 
and lipase. Thyroid function testing is to be done every [ADDRESS_646406] received  any study drug. Toxicity assessments 
will be continuous during the tr eatment phase. During the safety follow-up phase ( Table 5.1-3 ) 
toxicity assessments should be done in person. Once subjects reach the survival follow-up phase 
either in person or documented telephone calls to assess the subject’s status are acceptable. Adverse events and laboratory values will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0.On-study weight, ECOG performance status, and vital signs should be assessed at each on-study 
visit prior to dosing. Vital signs should also be taken as per institutional standard of care prior to, 
during and after infusions. The start and stop time of the study therapy infusions s hould be 
documented.
Physical examinations are to be performed as clinically indicated. If there are any new or 
worsening clinically significant changes since the last exam, report changes on the appropriate 
non-serious or serious adverse event page.
On treatment local laboratory assessments are to be completed within 72 hours prior to dosing.Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory tests, should be performed as 
clinically ind icated or to comply with local regu lations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme evaluations) will be monitored during the follow-up phase via on si te/local 
labs until all study drug related toxicities resolve, re turn to baseline, or are deemed irreversible.
If a participant shows pulmonary-related signs (hypoxia, fever) or symptoms (eg. dyspnea, cough, fever) consistent with possible pulmonary adverse events, the participant should be immediately 
evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the suspected pulmonary toxicity 
management algorithm in the BMS-936558 (nivolumab) Investigator Brochure.
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They 
are intended to be used as safety monitoring by [CONTACT_1963]. Additional testing or 
assessments may be performed as clinically necessary or where required by [CONTACT_20468].

At Screening, thyroid function testing is to include  TSH, free T3 and free T4. At subsequent time 
points, thyroid function testing consists of TSH only. However, if the TSH is abnormal, reflexive 
testing of free T3 and free T4 are to be performed. 
Management algorithms for suspected endocrinopathy adverse events (including abnormal thyroid

subjects participating in Part 1). Any additional imaging that may demonstrate tumor response or 
progression (including scans performed at unscheduled timepoints and/or at an outside institution) 
should be collected for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_646410] with PO/IV contrast or contrast enhanced MRI are the preferred imaging modalities for assessing radiographic tumor response. If a subject has a known allergy to contrast 
material, local prophylaxis standards may be used to obtain the assessment with contrast if at all 
possible, or use the alternate mo dality. In cases where contrast is strictly contraind icated, a 
non-contrast scan will suffice. Should a subject have a contraindication for CT IV contrast, a non-
contrast CT of the chest and a contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis may be obtained. 
Every attempt should be  made to image each subject using an ident ical acquisition protocol on the 
same scanner for all imaging time points. (Applies to both Part 1 and Part 2 Safety Lead in).
Use of CT component of a PET/CT scanner: Combined modality scanning such as with 
FDG-PET/CT is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a mod ality/technology that is in rapid 
evolution; therefore, the recommendations outlined here may change rather quickly with time. At 
present, low dose or attenuation correction CT por tions of a combined FDG-PET/CT are of limited 
use in anatomically based efficacy assessments and it  is therefore suggested that they should not 
be substituted for dedicated di agnostic contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomically based 
RECIST measurements. However, if a site can document that the CT performed as part of a FDG-PET/CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then

Date: 11-Jan-[ADDRESS_646411] portion of the FDG-PET/CT can be used for RECIST 1.1measurements. Note, however, 
that the FDG-PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed. 
MRI of brain is required at screening in order to rule out active metastatic disease.
Bone scan or PET scan is not adequate for assessment of RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_646412], abdomen, pelvis, and brain (to rule out brain metastases), all known sites of disease should 
be assessed at baseline. Subsequent assessments should include chest, a bdomen, pelvis, and all 
known sites of disease using the same imaging method and technique as was used at baseline.
Radiographic tumor response will be assessed at week 6 ( ±7 days) from first dose date, then every 
6 weeks ( ±7 days) for the first 12 months (until week 48) and every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) thereafter, 
until disease progression is documented or treatment is  discontinued (whichever occurs later).

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) i
s defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investig ation subject administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (suc h as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The causal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relatio nship between study drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study d rug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship. Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited duri ng open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
BMS will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorities and ethics committees according to 
local applicable laws including European Di rective 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.

6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)
•requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE
below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
•is an important medical event (defined as a med ical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate med ical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the s ubject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study d rug 
is an SAE. 
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver inju ry (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], thes e events must be handled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to st udy therapy (eg, d eath is an 
endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE: 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]: 
−a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
−elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
−admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
−routine h ealth assessment re quiring admission for baseline/trending of health s tatus 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)
−medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
−admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e g, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason)

6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expected ness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within [ADDRESS_646416] be collected that relate to a ny later prot ocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy). 
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. 
An SAE report must be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
(or designee) within [ADDRESS_646417] be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electronic or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting co llection is t hrough the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system is not functioning. 
In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data cap ture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. In the event the el ectronic system is unavailable for transmission, 
paper forms must be used and submitted immediatel y. When paper forms are used, the original 
paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
[CONTACT_20491].
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to st udy drug or if ne w information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS 
(or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
Revised Protocol No: 06

6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonser ious AE information s hould begin at initiation of study drug. All 
nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed treatment-r elated) are to be collected 
continuously during the tr eatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_646419] dose 
of study treatment.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that 
are reported/identified during the course of the study.

page or SAE Report Form electronic) as appropri ate. Paper forms are only intended as a back-up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning.
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that require d the subject to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to r eceive specific corrective 
therapy. It is expected that wherever possible,  the clinical rather than laboratory term would 
be used by [CONTACT_9673] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).

and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to BMS (or desi gnee) within [ADDRESS_646425] be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-rel ated laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND
2. Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_646426], without init ial findings of cholestasis ( elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND

Assuming 35% screening failure rate and 50% of all tested tissue samples are PD-L1 positive, it 
is estimated that approximately [ADDRESS_646432] 120 PD-L1 positive and 100 PD-L1 negative treated.
For Part 2 lead-in phase, there are 22 DLT evaluable sub jects within 28 subjects who initiate 
treatment assuming 20% of subjects do not complete the 9 week DLT evaluation period for reasons 
other than dose limiting toxicities. With a sample size of 22 DLT evaluable subjects with a safety 
event incident rate as 10%, there is above 90% probab ility to observe 1 or more cases of this safety 
event in this group. The goal is to identify safe regimens for future development, and safe is defined 
as 25% evaluated subjects or less exhibit DLTs (i e, 5 or less subjects with such events out of 
22 subjects). With 22 evaluable subjects, the false rej ection rate is 10% if the true toxicity rate is 
15%, the false acceptance rate is 16% if the true toxicity rate is 35%. The false rejection and false 
acceptance rates are deemed acceptable.

10 GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Term Definition
Complete AbstinenceComplete Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. 
This also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal, which are not acceptable 
methods of contraception. Women must continue to have pregnancy tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly or less effective contraception’s 
must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete 
abstinence.

Revised Protocol No: 06
Date: 11-Jan-[ADDRESS_646445] 1.1 GUIDELINES
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
1. [ADDRESS_646446] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
2. 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
3. [ADDRESS_646447] x-ray
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥[ADDRESS_646448] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatom ical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥[ADDRESS_646449] in which the 
image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, saggital or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. 
For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm 
but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesi ons. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measur able, including small les ions (longest diameter 
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable in clude: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415].

2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and w ill be recorded and measured at baseline (this means 
in instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of two and four lesions respectively will be recorded).
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions  with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the ba seline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to f urther characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathologi cal lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follow). In additi on, it is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
3 RESPONSE CRITERIA
3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that 
is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

3.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions s hould always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means th at when lymph nodes are included as target 
lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < [ADDRESS_646450] achieve a short axis < 10 mm. For PR, 
SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target 
lesions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non- nodal) recorded at baseline s hould have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which  are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel com fortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to  measure’. When this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_441837], the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm 
should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they 
usually have a definable size when normal and are frequent ly surrounded by [CONTACT_104178]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well). This 
default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_646451] slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent false respons es or progressi ons based upon 
measurement error. To reiterate, however, if the radi ologist is able to provide an actual measure, 
that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
[IP_ADDRESS] Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented  portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the max imal longest di ameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.

3.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesio ns. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they 
need not be meas ured and instead should be assesse d only qualitatively at the time points 
specified in the protocol.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10mm short 
axis). 
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (s ee comments below) of existing non-
target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
3.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease re quires additional explanation as follows:
[IP_ADDRESS] When the patient also has measurable diseaseIn this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy (see examples in Appendix 2  and further details below). A 
modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usu ally not sufficient to qualify 
for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progre ssion solely on the basis of 
change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
[IP_ADDRESS] When the patient has only non-measurable disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have 
measurable disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this 
instance there is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase 
in non-measurable disease burden. Because worsen ing in non-target disease cannot be easily 
quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all lesions are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for une quivocal progression is to consider  if the increase in overall 
disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion 
from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangi tic disease from localized to widespread, or may 
be described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient s hould be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While

that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial.
3.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on d etection of new lesions  are important. There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion s hould be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, 
necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is 
not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical lo cation that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will i ndicate disease progression. An example of this is 
the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain 
ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents t ruly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then  progression should be declared using the date of the init ial scan. 
While FDG-PET response assessments need additi onal study, it is sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following al gorithm:
1. Negative FDG-PET at bas eline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.
2. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.

aNon-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since SD is increasingly used as endpoint for  
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
Revised Protocol No: 06
Date: 11-Jan-[ADDRESS_646455] response determination of complete or partial response requires confirmation: Complete or  
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point  
of ≥[ADDRESS_646456] ove rall response can be interpreted as in Table 
3.3.3-1.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum of target  
lesions and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement  
reported on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in  
order not to overstate progression s hould it be based on increase in s ize of the nodes. As noted 
earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report  
form (CRF).

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR  
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappear ed af ter CR). 
Best response would depend on whether minimum dur ation for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not  
CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best 
response is PR.
bMinimum duration for SD is 6 weeks.

Verification of Response: To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by [CONTACT_501727] 
[ADDRESS_646457] met. For this study, the next scheduled tumor assessment can meet this requirement.
Verification of Progression: Progression of disease should be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then  progression should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is considered to not have 
progressive disease.

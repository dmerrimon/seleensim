BACKGROUND  AND  SIGNIFICANCE   
 
Fabry disease is an x -linked lysosomal storage disease defined by a deficiency of alpha -
galactoside, leading to the accumulation of a cell membrane derived glycolipid, 
globotriaosylceramide, and its metabolites within the cytoplasm and lysosomes of many ty pes of 
cells, including endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, renal glomerular cells, and neurons (Clarke, 
2007) . Gastrointestinal manifestations such as ab dominal pain, diarrhea and nausea are 
prominent and, although typi[INVESTIGATOR_514557] -threatening, can frequently cause significant 
morbidity and burden in a patient’s life. Recent studies have found that up to 50% (range of 16 -
70%) of patients with Fabry disea se, including both males and females, experience 
gastrointestinal symptoms (Hoffman et al., 2007). The symptoms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_514558], after acroparesthesia, with the mean onset in males at age 5 
years and females  several years later at 9.5 years. Although females present later, the severity of 
the symptoms equalizes as the patient ages (Hoffmann, Schwarz, Mehta, & Keshav, 2007) . 
 
The gastrointestinal symptoms can vary in intensity and can occur anywhere along the GI tract 
including the stomach, small and large bowel. They tend to progress in incidence over time. The 
most common complaint is abdominal pain with up to one third of ad ults endorsing this ailment 
and many children reporting it as their initial GI symptom  (Hoffmann et al., 2007; Mehta et al., 
2004) .  It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_158412] a crampi[INVESTIGATOR_514559] -abdominal pain worsened wi th meals and 
increased stress. Alterations in bowel habits is the next most common GI presentation, with 
many patients complaining of urgent, explosive, post -prandial diarrhea frequently necessitating 
significant lifestyle changes. Others, mostly female, e xperience constipation (Hoffman, 2007). 
Less common, but significant gastric symptoms are also reported including nausea, vomiting and 
early satiety. Patients describe decreased appetite, inability to tolerate many foods and feelings of 
bloating consistent  with gastric dysmotility.  
 
Although the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms in Fabry’s disease was first described more 
than 50 years ago by [CONTACT_514585] 1958, little remains known about the specific 
pathophysiology of the symptoms (Van Waygen, 1958) . Few case reports have examined the 
histology and dysmotility affecting those with gastrointestinal symptoms with no large scale 
studies ever conducted. The symptoms are speculated to be caused by a combina tion of 
vasculopathy and neuropathy due to glycolipid accumulation causing ischemia leading to cellular 
necrosis and also alterations in cell function resulting in a pro -inflammatory state. The effects on 
neurons and the nearby [CONTACT_514586], both mechanic al and functional, are thought to cause 
dysmotility thus producing many of the gastrointestinal symptoms (Aerts et al., 2008) . These 
pathophysiological mechanisms have been more extensively studied in other systems such as 
cardiac, renal and dermal, however litt le is confirmed in the actual gastrointestinal cell (Askari  et 
al., 2007; Liguori et al., 2010; Simon, Frey, Gruler, & Bültmann, 1990)  
 
Several case reports have been published examining the evaluation of patients with 
gastrointestinal complaints in Fabry  disease. Superficial biopsies taken from the small bowel  and 
rectum, showed normal villous architecture and normal surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_514560] (Flynn et al., 1972; Friedman et al., 1984; Jack et al., 1991; O’Brien et al., 
1982) . The blood vessels and muscle cells of the  muscularis mucosa were noted to have deposits 
with luxol fast blue positive material. Electron microscopy noted electron dense intralysosomal 
striped “zebra -like” bodies in smooth muscle and ganglion cells (Sheth et al., 1981) . To our best 
knowledge, all the prior studies have completed analysis with only superficial biopsies, with no 
more than [ADDRESS_666866] been published more than a decade ago. 
Furthermore, there has been no in depth quantification of gastrointestinal cellular injury or 
comparison to control specimens.  
 
Additionally, there has been only one published report of the underlying functional dysmotility 
analysis in these patients. In 1987, Argoff et al found that 5 out of 7 patients with gastric 
symptoms had delay in gastric emptying scan and responded well to metoclopramide, suggesting 
a similar neuropathy to that seen in diabetic gastropathy (Argoff et al., 1998) . Although many of 
the presenting gastrointestinal symptoms seem to involve dysfunction of the whole 
gastrointestinal tract, additional motility testing examining the sma ll and large bowel has not 
been completed in these patients.  
 
As the underlying pathology remains unclear, there is no Fabry -specified protocol for evaluation 
of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Bloodwork is frequently completed for initial 
evaluation of symptoms including CBC and electrolytes, which are typi [INVESTIGATOR_514561]. Additional 
workup including imaging such as a KUB may be performed, which is also commonly without 
abnormalities. In some patients with persistence of concerning symptoms, it may be clinically 
necessary to complete further evaluation via colo noscopy to evaluate for underlying mucosal 
disease.  
 
The treatment for the GI symptoms in Fabry disease was historically symptomatic, utilizing 
promotility drugs, neuromodulators and antibiotics. The management has progressed recently 
with the initiation of enzyme replacement therapy over the past decade with many patients 
starting the replacement at younger ages. Although enzyme replacement therapy has shown 
promising results with some decrease in symptom severity, GI complaints remain a significant 
cause  of morbidity for some patients on ERT (Banikazemi et al., 2005; Barbey et al., 2007; 
Zarate & Hopkin, 2008) . More in depth understanding of gastrointestinal symptoms 
pathophysiology in Fabry disease is acutely needed in order to develop more specific evaluation 
of the symptoms and advance the treatment of these patients. By [CONTACT_514587] c haracterization of symptoms and the relationship to dysmotility, we anticipate improved and 
more focused adjunct therapi[INVESTIGATOR_514562].  
SPECIFIC AIMS   
 
Primary Aim  – Dysmotility  
The primary goal of the study is to gain further comprehension of the pathophysiology 
underlying dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract and to correlate the abnormal findings with 
symptoms in an attempt to further classify the disease manifestation . This investigation will be 
achieved by [CONTACT_514588], small bowel and colon emptying time. Additionally, 
neurologic and myopathic changes will be analyzed through evaluation of contractility, pH and 
temperature of the bowel as measured by [CONTACT_109746][INVESTIGATOR_514563]. These results will be correlated 
with th e patient’s subjective gastrointestinal symptoms in an attempt to elucidate a causational 
relationship between functional abnormalities with presentation.  
 
The aim in this phase of the study is to gain additional understanding of the disease manifestation  
via motility abnormalities in order to improve symptom targeted therapy. They hypothesis is that 
patients with fabry disease will have abnormal motility which will correlate with the patients 
symptoms and quality of life as noted on the questionnaires .  
 
Secondary Aim - Histology  
A secondary goal will be examine all aspects of histological injury including neuronal such as 
myelin depletion and nerve swelling, vascular such as intima thickening and cellular 
hypertrophy, and GL -[ADDRESS_666867] in 
symptomatic patients with Fabry disease who are treatment naive or with only <[ADDRESS_666868] abnormal findings on histology, which will correlate with 
the subjects symptoms and findings of on the questionnaires.  
 
Secondary Aim – Protocol  
There is no uniform protocol for assessment and evaluation of gastrointestinal complaints in 
patients with Fabry  disease. The aim is to create a protocol for Fabry disease caretakers  to follow 
based on the histologic and dysmotility findings.

SUBJECT  ENROLLMENT  
 
The study will be presented to patients at their regularly scheduled Fabry clinic follow up visit if 
they report any gastrointestinal symptoms currently or within the past year.  If the patient is 
interested in participation, the consent form will be reviewed by [CONTACT_514594]. All questions will be 
answered. The patient can choose to sign the consent form on the day of the clinic visit, but it is 
not a requirement. They will be given the  opportunity to take the conse nt form home and decide 
at a later time if they would like to participate.  If the patient does not contact [CONTACT_514595] a week, the patient will be contact[CONTACT_514596]. If interested, 
the research coordinator will schedule the visit with the gastroenterologist.  If they choose to sign 
the consent form on the day of the clinic visit, th ey will be given the option to complete the 
screening visit on that day or scheduling the screening visit for a later date within the following [ADDRESS_666872]  the option of signing the consent at their routine Fabry  follow up visit or prior to the 
screening visit. If the patient agrees to participation and signs the consent  form, he will be 
enrolled in the study.   
  
Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) 
This visit will last approximately 45 minutes. A  history and physical will be completed, with 
particular focus on the gastrointestinal symptoms including gastrointestinal medications and 
interventions . Patient will then complete various questionnaires and forms relating to their 
gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of life and psychiatric issues . 
  
Validated Questionnaires and other data collection – The patient will complete questionnaires 
including:  
1. IBS-QOL (Irritable Bowel Syndrome -Quality of Life)  
2. GSRS -IBS ( Gastrointestinal Symp tom Rating Scale – Irritable Bowel Syndrome)  
3. IBS – work productivity/activity impairment  
4. Bristol stool chart  
5. BDI (Beck Depression Inventory)  
6. HAM -A (Hamilton anxiety rating scale )  
7. SSI – Symptom Severity Scale  
8. GCSI (Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Checklist)

Preparation for Study Visit [ADDRESS_666873] remain NPO starting at 10 :00pm the night prior to 
the study initiation. Alcohol is prohibited [ADDRESS_666874] will be completed on any woman of child 
bearing age as pregnant woman are excluded from the study.  
 
SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_514568] (Visit 2)  
This study visit should take about [ADDRESS_666875] will schedule a follow up visit (visit #3) to return the receiver and 
the diary and discuss any questions about the study. If the patient has travelled a far distance to 
participa te, they will be given instructions on mailing the receiver and diary back to the office.   
 
After the visit, the subject will ke ep the receiver at no more than [ADDRESS_666876] o f the screening visit (visit 1). The subject will 
be consented by [CONTACT_514597] , if not already 
previously consented during their genetics clinic visit . The subjec t will be given the opportunity 
to ask any questions they may have.  The subject will also answer the questionnaires  during this 
first hour . If eligible, t he second hour of this condensed visit will consist of the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_93680] 
(visit 2).  
 
Follow Up Visit (Visit 3)  
This study visit should take about [ADDRESS_666877]’s  history or on the 
study results , we may prescribe erythromycin as a promotility medication or obtain a KUB for 
verification.   
 
If the patient cannot return the receiver in person, they will be provided with information on 
maili ng the receiver back. Once the results have been reviewed, the patient will be contact[CONTACT_514598][INVESTIGATOR_514569].  
 
If the patient is appropriate for the endoscopic mucosal  resection, this will be scheduled within 
the following 3 weeks .  
 
Sigmoidoscopy and Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (Visit 4)  
This study visit should take about 3.5 hours to complete.  
 
This study visit consists of a sigmoidoscopy with biopsies and an endoscopic mucosal  resection. 
When additional workup of gastrointestinal symptoms is warranted for altered bowel habits 
and/or  abdominal pain, a subset of [ADDRESS_666878] the night prior and receive 2 enemas the morning of the proce dure. The 
patient will present for completion of a clinically needed sigmoidoscopy with routine rectal and 
sigmoid biopsy collection. In addition, an e ndoscopic mucosal resection will be completed in the 
rectum. Biopsies will be sent to pathology for the f ollowing analysis.  
1. Light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid schiff, toluidine blue and 
acetylcholine staining.  
2. Electron microscopy  
3. Immunohistochemistry staining with anti -Gb3 monoclonal antibody.  
All specimens will be examined for cellu lar morphology, other significant noted injury or 
structural abnormalities and location of deposition. The biopsies will be specifically analyzed for 
vascular and neuropathic changes. The specimens will be assessed for presence or absence of 
neuronal swell ing, myelination, vascular sclerosis, intimal fibrosis and hypertrophy of the 
smooth muscles of the arterioles. The neurological and vascular cells will be assessed for 
deposition and quantification will be determined based on a degree of deposition scale used 
previously for renal biopsy analysis in Fabry disease (0 No deposit, +deposit present in a few 
cells, ++ deposits present in some cells, +++ deposits present in many cells) (Valbuena et al., 
2008) . Finally, results of analysi s of all specimens will be compared to healthy aged -matched 
controls obtained from banked specimens in the pathology department. Once the analysis is 
completed, results will be correlated with the patient’s gastrointestinal symptom presentation.  
 
Patients Travelling from  Out of State 
 
Prior to scheduling the visit, the patient will be provided with an electronic copy of the consent 
form  in accordance with Partners Information Security guidelines . They will be advised to read it 
over. The study staff will then contact [CONTACT_77050] a couple days and answer any questions 
the patient may have about the study and can be put in contact [CONTACT_514599]. The patient 
will be notified of all medica tions that needs to be stopped for the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_514570], for 
the sigmoidoscopy.  All information for the sigmoidoscopy will be sent to the patient and the 
subject can be put in contact [CONTACT_4490] a physician to answer any additional questions. If the pa tient 
agrees, the condensed visit will be scheduled.  
 
The scheduled vis it will be a condensed visit consisting of visit [ADDRESS_666879] day, the 
scheduled visit will include the screening visit (visit 1) and the sigmoidoscopy and EMR ( visit 
4). The patient will b e consented by [CONTACT_514600] e medical history and 
physical and completing the  questionnaires. After, the patient will be prepped for the 
sigmoidoscopy  and EMR . On the second day, the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_514571]. This option 
will also be available for patients who are in state but cannot travel to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514572].  
 
ADDITIONAL STUDY INFORMATION  
 
Description of SmartPil l 
The SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_514573], a receiver, a rec eiver 
docking station and display software.  The capsule houses sensors for pH, temperature, and 
pressure, and has the ability to transmit the sensed data at [ADDRESS_666880] receives and  stores data; the MotiliGI 
software provides calculations and graphical displays to the physician.  After activation and 
ingestion, the capsule signals are transmitted from within the GI tract and are captured by a 
receiving antenna incorporated into the r eceiver, which also provides an interface for data 
transmission to a PC as well as connections for battery charging.  The capsule functions for at 
least 5 days after activation and has a pH range of 0.5 to 9 with an accuracy of ±0.5 pH units.  
The pressure  sensor has a pressure range of 0 to 350 mm Hg with an accuracy of 5 mmHg.  The 
temperature sensor has a range of 25° to 49°C, with an accuracy of ±0.8°C.  
 
SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_514574] n pump inhibitors [ADDRESS_666881] 72 
hours prior to the study and for the 5 days of the study.  This includes enemas, cathartics, PEG 
solutions (including Miralax, enulose).  Patients with constipation may take medications to help 
stimulate a bowel movement with either milk of magnesia, 2.4 to 4.8 grams (30 -60 ml), or 
magnesium citrate, [ADDRESS_666882] (beginning at 
midnight).  Date of the start of the last menstrual period for female subjects will be recorded.  
 
The SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_514575].  All study s ubjects will ingest a SmartBar 
(a nutritional bar) consisting of approximately [ADDRESS_666883] in a sitting position, one can of regular Ensure (Vanilla, 
lactose -free, 8 fluid ounces [237 ml]; 250 calories) will be ingested.  
 
All study subjects will maintain a diary and will record times of bowel movements, meals, 
gastrointestinal symptoms (pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting), and supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_8071].  
Subjects will be instructed, if they wish, to recover and return the SmartP ill capsule along with the 
diary and receiver at the end of the study. If they are unable to return to the office  due to distance , 
they will be give n material to send the items via  FedEx.  
 
Endoscopic Mucosal  Resection  Procedure  
EMR uses a standard cap devi ce which fits over the end of the endoscope.   EMR is used 
frequently in current practice at the MGH for upper and lower GI tract lesions.    
 
BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Descriptive statistics based on a series of 50 patients for histologic and dysmotility findings. 
Univariate and multivariate regression analysis of relationship between motility parameters, 
histologic disease state and GI symptoms in Fabry patients.  
 
Powe r 
Based on prior studies examining gastric emptying time (GET), there was found to be a 70% 
correlation between abnormal gastric emptying time and symptomatic patients. Additionally, in 
order to have significant power for regression analysis, 25 patients w ith positive symptom 
association with gastric emptying time would be needed. Therefore, based on the 70% 
correlation of symptoms to GET, [ADDRESS_666884] abnormal GET. Based on the results 
from Argoff et al, 5 out of 7 (70%) of Fabry  patients with symptoms of gastroparesis including 
nausea and early satiety, had delayed gastric emptying time. Thus, extrapolating to this study, 50 
Fabry patients will need to be examined for dysmotility, in order to obtain the 35 patients with 
delayed gastric emptying  time for analysis and correlation.    
Additionally, larger cohort size enables use of multivariate correlation with increased usage of 
symptom and demographic variables. However, study size remains restricted due to likely 
limited patient availability.  
 
RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS   
 
The SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_514576]:  
Risks of the ingestion and passage of the capsule through the GI tract are minimal. Currently, 
several other diagnostic capsules, the Given Pi[INVESTIGATOR_514577], are FDA 
released medical devices. The SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_514578], 
therefore, poses similar risk. In the [ADDRESS_666885] imated as 0.75% in patients without known stenosis and 21% in 
patients with known stenosis. Stenosis and strictures can be complications in inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD).  
 
Adverse events and functional technical issues with the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_514579]. The capsule may fail to empty from the stomach and fail to be expelled 
from the GI tract. Subjects ingesting the capsule or the meal may have nausea, vomiting, 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_514580], abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation. In previous studies 
with adult subjects (n=326), a total of 28 adverse events were reported: 19 were not device 
related, 7 were probably not device related, 1 was possibly related (sub -sternal pain) and one was 
definitely related. The one definitely related adverse device effect occurred when the capsule 
failed to empty the stomach after [ADDRESS_666886] nausea, vomiting, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_514581], abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation.  
 
Risks of the Washout Period  
Prior to the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_514582] , patients will discontinue many of their gastrointestinal  
medications . During this washout pe riod, the patient’s  bowel symptoms may get worse.  
 
Risks of Endoscopic Mucosal Resection  
Patients enrolled in the study will have one additional low risk procedure (EMR) at the time  of 
their sigmoidoscopy .  Patients who warrant a sigmoidoscopy will be asked to participate .  
Sedation should improve the discomfort of the EMR , but has a risk of complications (primarily 
low BP, slowed heart rate or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]) of approximately 1/100.  EMR is a common procedure 
in gastroenterology with a low risk for recta l lesions.  In this procedure, one additional small 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_514583] . 
 
The risk of one small EMR in the rectum has not been studied in large groups of patients.  The 
risks of EMR in patients with large polyps in the rec tum or with large superficial rectal 
neoplasms vary in the literature.  Many smaller studies report no perforations or hemorrhages as 
a result of EMR.  In one large study of EMR for colorectal neoplasia and polyps in 1000 patients, 
the rate of perforation was 0.2% and bleeding was 2%. Error! Bookmark not defined.   Large 
Japanese series with colorectal tumors have reported a perforation rate 0.35% (3/863) and a 
bleeding risk of  1.16% (10/863) with colonic EMR. Error! Bookmark not defin ed.  The risk of one 
small EMR in the rectum has not been studied in large groups of patients, but presumably has a  
lower risk than that seen with large resections or pi[INVESTIGATOR_514584].  There is 
no psychosocial risk associated with the intervention (EMR).  Infants, children age [ADDRESS_666887] forms.   
 
Coded information from this study will be shar ed with the sponsor, Genzyme Corporation. The 
data that is shared will be coded results with no identifiable information. The principle 
investigator will retain the key to the code at Partners.

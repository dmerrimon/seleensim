 Study Description:  In this study, we will test the extent to which emotionally supportive 
communication from a surgeon is associated with patient 
preference for total thyroidectomy. We will conduct a hypothetical 
choice experiment with “analogue” patients, defined as those with a 
benign thyroid nodule not requiring surgery. We will collect baseline measures, then randomize participants  to watch a video simulation 
of a patient -surgeon discussion about treatment options for low -risk 
thyroid cancer with or without emotionally supportive statements. We hypothesize that increased emotionally supportive communication by [CONTACT_262611], reduce anxiety and thyroid 
cancer fear , and increase decisional confidence, perceived 
physician empathy,  trust in physician, and information recall.

 2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Thyroid cancer incidence has  increased significantly due to incidental detection of small, low- risk cancers.1–10  
The majority  of these patients undergo total thyroidectomy , even though hemi- thyroidectomy has  comparable 
long- term outcomes .11–13  Compared to hemi- thyroidectomy, total thyroidectomy has greater potential for 
serious long- term, permanent  adverse harms.3,10,14– [ADDRESS_319274] equivalent 
recurrence and survival, total thyroidectomy is considered overtreatment, as the potential harms outweigh the 
oncologic  benefit.5,12,21 –23,[ADDRESS_319275] that  despi[INVESTIGATOR_262593] 100% survival,  patients with low- risk thyroid cancer experience fear and anxiety  
in response to their diagnosis and a desire to “get the cancer out”  to achieve peace of mind.25–[ADDRESS_319276] of emotionally 
supportive language from surgeons on patients’  treatment decisions.  
This study  involves  a hypothetical choice experiment with “analogue” patients, defined as those with a benign, 
≤[ADDRESS_319277] increas ed significantly , primarily due to low- risk 
cancers with a very low mortality .1–3,[ADDRESS_319278]  patients with these low-risk thyroid cancer s undergo total 
thyroidectomy , a riskier  surgical approach  that represents overtreatment for many because it does not improve 
survival compared to  less extensive options .12,14,21,23 Overtreatment with total thyroidectomy can result in harms 
such as difficulty speaking, swallowing,  regulating calcium, and significant fatigue.17–20,30– [ADDRESS_319279] of surgeon emotional support on treatment choices for low -risk thyroid cancer: a randomized hypothetical choice 
experiment  
Protocol version 11/8/[ADDRESS_319280] or prostate 
cancer , leading to unwanted, unnecessary, or overly extensive care.25,26,37– 40 Therefore, the hypothesis  of this 
line of investigation is that emotions influence patients’ treatment decisions about low -risk thyroid cancer, 
leading to decisions that over treat.  
 
Previous studies using patient -physician simulation have demonstrated that emotionally supportive statements 
from a physician can  reduce patient anxiety , increase patient trust, and increase information recall .41–[ADDRESS_319281] been  successfully translated back into clinical practice for the development of effective physician-
based interventions.42–44,[ADDRESS_319282] of  
responding to  emotional reactions to thyroid cancer diagnosis on treatment choice .  
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
This study meets the criteria for minimal risk, as the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life. There are known potential risks for par ticipants: in addition to potential loss of confidentiality, there is potential 
for psychological stress from taking a survey that asks them to imagine they have been diagnosed with cancer. Similar studies have been performed in patients without a cancer diagnosis with no known adverse outcomes.  
2.3.[ADDRESS_319283] of surgeon emotional support on treatment choices for low -risk thyroid cancer: a randomized hypothetical choice 
experiment  
Protocol version 11/8/21  
  
Participants will be informed that participation is voluntary and they may skip questions they do not want to answer and/or decline to compete the study. They will be reminded to contact [CONTACT_262613].  
 
Multiple steps have been incorporated to reduce the likelihood of a breach in confidentiality . Furthermore, if a 
breach in confidentiality occurs, it will not negatively impact these participants because the data collected are 
not sensitive or stigmatizing in any way.  
 
Study investigators and staff will be alert for any potential harms to participants, including breaches of confidentiality. Any breach of confidentiality will be immediately reported to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_262594]-Madison Minimal Risk IRB, and the UW -Madison HIPAA Privacy and Security Officers. The risk of breach 
of confidentiality is low because adequate provisions are in place to ensure that breach of confidentiality will not occur , as described in section 10.1.[ADDRESS_319284] the extent to which increased 
emotionally supportive communication by 
[CONTACT_262614].  
 We will measure which treatment 
participant s would choose if they were 
the patient with thyroid cancer in the video (total thyroidectomy or 
hemi thyroidectomy)  immediately after 
they finish watching the video . Treatment choice is the primary endpoint 
because prior studies in different 
populations indicate increased emotional support can influence medical choices . 
Emotionally supportive communication is most likely to impact patient preference in the short -term, as the treatment 
decision is being made.  
Secondary  
Test the extent to which increased 
emotionally supportive communication by [CONTACT_262612] , thyroid 
cancer fear,  perceived empathy, trust,  and 
decisional confidence.  
 We will measure these endpoints  
immediately after participants finish 
watching the video,  using the State 
Trait Anxiety Inventory brief,  an 
adapted Cancer Fear Scale  an adapted 
Trust in Physician Scale, an adapted Jefferson Scale of Patient’s Perceptions 
of Physician’s Empathy, and decisional 
confidence using a single -item  10-point 
Likert  scale.  These secondary endpoints we re 
selected  because they represent 
potential  emotion -related outcomes  in 
the treatment decision -making  process . 
Prior studies indicate the increased emotionally supportive communication can influence these outcomes in other 
medical settings . 
Tertiary/Exploratory  
Test the extent to which increased 
emotionally supportive communication by 
[CONTACT_262615].  We will assess information recall 
immediately after participants finish

will proceed to the  pre-intervention survey (administered prior to randomization) which will include 
demographics (sex assigned at birth, age, race, ethnicity, education, personal cancer history , clinical history  
regarding their recent biopsy , and baseli ne measures including the STAI -[ADDRESS_319288] in physician scale, a 5- question information recall questionnaire  about the treatment options  discussed in 
the video, and the following questions: (1) “If you were the patient in the video, which treatment option would 
you choose for yourself?” and (2) “How confident do you feel that you would be choosing the best treatment 
option for you?” on a 10- point scale [not at all confident to completely confident].47–50 Our primary outcome is 
treatment choice: total or hemi -thyroidectomy. We chose the STAI -[ADDRESS_319289] -
intervention measures are further described in Section 8.1.  Participation is expected to take less than 30 
minutes to complete.  
 Intervention:  We have created two videos using rigorous methods described by [CONTACT_262616]. for creating 
internally and externally valid videos that manipulate affective communication. 
51 The videos are 5- 6 minutes in 
length and portray a conversation between a patient and surgeon during which the surgeon discusses: the diagnosis, prognosis, available treatment options, benefits and harms of the options, and need for decision making. The surgeon speaks for the majority of the simulated visit and discusses total and hemi -thyroidectomy. 
The scripts are identical between arms except for the addition of emotionally supportive statements and

 gestures in the intervention script. This study design using simulated patient -provider conversations that 
manipulate affective communication in analogue patients has been employed by [CONTACT_262617]- based interventions.42–44,46  
 Randomization:  Participants will be stratified based on sex . Males are more likely to undergo less extensive 
treatment.

participants 1:[ADDRESS_319292] -intervention measures. Study 
staff will not know participants’ arm assignment.  
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
Use of analogue patients (i.e. patients with benign thyroid nodules that do not need surgery) is necessary because this type of controlled experiment is not feasible in clinical practice and may affect patients’ treatment course.  
4.[ADDRESS_319293] chosen this mode of delivery because it is not feasible to deliver the 
intervention on the same day as the thyroid nodule biopsy. Final cytology results are not available on the same 
day; we do not want to over burden patients on the day of their appointment ; and we want to allow a short 
washout period from time of biopsy to time of study participation.

5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION 
We will enroll 118 patients 18 years of age and older who are seen in a UW Health Clinic for a fine needle 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] ( FNA) of a thyroid nodule and receive benign pathology results . About 70% of FNAs at UW are 
benign, however not all patients with benign FNAs will meet other inclusion criteria. W e anticipate  screening 
approximately 600 patients in order to reach 118 participants.  
 
Study staff will mail letters endorsed by [CONTACT_262618][INVESTIGATOR_307], The American 
Center, and/or [ADDRESS_319296] of surgeon emotional support on treatment choices for low -risk thyroid cancer: a randomized hypothetical choice

Protocol version 11/8/[ADDRESS_319297] (Health Link) access may search clinic schedules, 
Launchpad pathology records, and/or patient list templates  (e.g. reporting workbench reports, reports of 
targeted EHR searches set up by [CONTACT_262619] [CHI2]) made available to them as 
part of their research access to Health Link to mail letters, check biopsy results , and help identify participants  
for study enrollment. After a patient has a biopsy and receives a brochure, a member of the study team will verify eligibility criteria in Health Link and log eligibility results in a tracking document. If the patient is eligible, a member of the study team will contact [CONTACT_244451], mail, and MyChart (if available, through CHI2)  to 
recruit them for the study. If we are unable to reach the patient during our first phone and mail contact [CONTACT_103904], 
we may make up to three more contact [CONTACT_262620]. All attempts to contact [CONTACT_262621] a tracking document.  
 We have designed study procedures  including consent, baseline measures, intervention, and outcome 
measures to all take place in less than 30 minutes on one day, therefore we anticipate attrition will be low. We 
will be available by [CONTACT_262622].

intervention  We will assess patients’ hypothetical treatment choice after the intervention. 
We will ask: “If you were the patient in the video and had recently been 
diagnosed with thyroid cancer, which of the two treatment options would you choose, knowing what you know right now?” Answers will include: removal of the entire thyroid, removal of half of the thyroid.  
Secondary  Decision 
confidence  Post -
intervention  We will assess patients’ confidence in their treatment choice after the 
intervention. We will ask: “How confident do you feel that you are choosing the best treatment option for you?” Answers will range from 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (completely confi dent).  
N/A Manipulation

8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_9155] (OHRP).  OHRP considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol- related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the  characteristics of the participant 
population being studied; 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS REPORTING  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_199779] (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The UP report will inc lude the following information: 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents 
an UP  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP  
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:    
• Any UP will be reported to the IRB and to the funding agency within 14 business days  of the 
investigator becoming aware of the problem  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s written 
reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for Human Research 
Protections (OHRP) within 14 business days  of the IRB’s r eceipt of the report of the problem from the 
investigator

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
Primary Endpoint: We hypothesize that emotionally supportive communication will decrease patient preference 
for total thyroidectomy  immediately after watching the video. 
 
Secondary Endpoints : We hypothesize  that emotionally supportive communication will decrease anxiety and 
thyroid cancer fear and increase trust, perceived empathy, and decisional confidence immediately after 
watching the video.  Tertiary/exploratory:  We hypothesize that emotionally supportive communication will increase information recall  
immediately after watching the video. 
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
We assume based on existing data that the proportion of participants choosing total thyroidectomy will be 0.89 
and estimate the sample size needed for 90% power to detect a proportion lower than 89%. With a sample of 
n=[ADDRESS_319316] risk differences of - 25% and medium effect sizes of - 0.60 with 
90% power  using a 2- sided test (chi square for binary outcome) with Type I error rate alpha= 0.05 . The UW 
Thyroid Nodule Biopsy clinic performs over 500 biopsies annually, of which approximately 70% are benign. 
The UW Radiology clinic performs [ADDRESS_319317] deviations, median, and range. For inferential tests, we will use 2 -sided tests with Type I error rate 
alpha=0.05 for statistical significance. C ovariates are specified below .  Checks for assumptions of normality 
will be performed. If data are not normal, nonparametric tests  will be used.  
 
9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
The primary endpoint, treatment choice, is a binary scale. It will be measured once immediately after the intervention.  
[ADDRESS_319318] of surgeon emotional support on treatment choices for low -risk thyroid cancer: a randomized hypothetical choice 
experiment  
Protocol version 11/8/21  
 We will calculate distributional characteristics and perform a two- group intent to treat analysis for this binary 
endpoint  using conditional logistic regression to account for stratification by [CONTACT_4321].  The Type I error rate alpha= 
0.05.  
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
We will calculate distributional characteristics and perform a two -group intent to treat analysis for  continuous or 
ordinal endpoints using 2 -sided t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA)  with Type I error rate alpha= 0.05, and 
risk differences or mean differences with confidence intervals for quantification and estimation of effect.

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1  REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS  
All potential participants (i.e. adults getting thyroid nodule biopsies) will receive a letter with a URL for 
uwchoices.org, and an informational brochure about the study. Potential participants who are confirmed to be eligible will be given a link to complete the study on Qualtrics. After passing eligibility screening questions, they 
will see a n information page describing the study intervention, study procedures, and risks. The information 
page will tell participants to contact [CONTACT_262628].  
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
This clinical trial is a hypothetical choice experiment that presents no more than minimal risk of harm to 
subjects. It involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research 
context. Therefore we will have a waiver of signed consent and present an information page to participants on Qualtrics . Participants will be asked to contact [CONTACT_262629]. At the end of the information page on Qualtrics, participants will told that clicking to the next page 
indicates their consent  to participate in the study . 
10.1.2   STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_262630], funding agency, and regulatory author ities. If the study is 
prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB), and sponsor/funding agency and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or 
suspension.  
 Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Insufficient compliance of study staff to the protocol   (i .e., significant protocol violations)  
[ADDRESS_319322] of surgeon emotional support on treatment choices for low -risk thyroid cancer: a randomized hypothetical choice 
experiment  
Protocol version 11/8/21  
 • Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable 
 
The study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed, and 
satisfy the funding agency, sponsor, IRB, or other relevant regulatory or  oversight bodies (OHRP, DSMB).  
10.1.[ADDRESS_319323] completed the requisite human subjects/Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) training and have been given valid access to electronic medical records.  
 
Patient information is limited to the minimum necessary to screen for eligibility, recruit patients, and mail 
participant incentives. The study participant’s contact [CONTACT_262631]. We will also use names, MRNs, and dates/times of appointments.  Identifying information will be 
separated from study data. Once the study is complete, all PHI will be destroyed. At the end of the study, all 
records will continue to be kept in a secure location for 7 years or longer . 
 Confidentiality will be protected further by: 1) using a participant log form that contains only the minimum 
necessary protected health information (PHI) concerning participants and storing this log on a secure 
password- protected server; 2) coding data collection forms with a consecutive participant number that is not 
derived from any participant personal identifiers and linking that data collection form to the participant log; 3) storing the participant log and data collection forms separately; and 4) not sharing PHI with anyone outside the 
research team. It is highly likely that these measures will result in avoidance of breach of confidentiality outside 
of the research. In addition, the data to be collected are not sensitive to participants.  
 
Survey data will be stored on a secure Department of Surgery server. Data will be shared with Drs. Susan Pi[INVESTIGATOR_262595]. The data will not include identifiable 
information or the keycode. This information will be shared using the secure server file transfer service 
maintained by [CONTACT_262632] t.surgery.wisc.edu. This is a secure, password- protected 
system and files transferred through it are automatically deleted from the service [ADDRESS_319324] of surgeon emotional support on treatment choices for low -risk thyroid cancer: a randomized hypothetical choice

 the protection of privacy, confidentiality, and security for data dissemination and reuse (e.g., all data will be 
thoroughly de -identified and will not be traceable to a specific study participant). Plans for archiving and long-
term preservation of the dat a will b e implemented, as appropriate.

 Participants  will be given information for reporting study misconduct. The following language will be included 
on the information page preceding the study : “If you have any questions about your rights as a research 
subject or have complaints about the research study or study team, contact [CONTACT_262633] [PHONE_4168]. The Patient Relations Representatives work with research subjects to address  concerns about

The PI [INVESTIGATOR_262596]. Study staff will report any adverse event or unanticipated problem to the PIs 
immediately. The PIs will report any serious, unexpected, and study -related adverse event or unanticipated 
problem to the local University of Wisconsin (UW) Minimal Risk IRB according to the institution’s requirements. 
The IRB will review all adverse events during continuing review, which will likely occur annually. Given that our intervention is a hypothetical choice experiment for patients who have benign thyroid nodules, rather than a clinical intervention, we do not anticipate any problems.  
 We will use the UW’s Institute for Clinical and Translational Research’s (ICTR) Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC). ICTR is UW’s NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award and provides extensive research support.

Protocol version 11/8/[ADDRESS_319328] safety, research integrity, 
and compliance with federal regulations and local policies.  
 
The UW ICTR DMC is comprised of experienced members (core plus ad hoc) with expertise required to 
oversee this study. The DMC members will review protocol -specific reports created by [CONTACT_262634]. These standard reports will include an overview of study objectives, a review of actual and projected accrual rates, an evaluation of patient demographics for balance of randomization, and a 
summary of the number and seriousness of adverse events. Source documents may be reviewed to allow the 
DMC to independently judge whether the overall integrity and conduct of the protocol remain acceptable based on data provided and reported by [CONTACT_978]. The DMC will make recommendations to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_262597], modification, suspension, or termination.  
 
In providing oversight for the conduct of this study, the ICTR DMC will meet with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_262598], 
after the first few participants have been enrolled, and at least biannually thereafter to review enrollment and adverse events. Additional meetings will be scheduled as determined by [CONTACT_262635]. Because this study is minimal risk, there are no planned interim analyses or predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262599], efficacy, or harms. We will submit all reportable events to the DMC and the UW Minimal Risk IRB in 
accordance with their reporting guidelines.  
10.1.7  CLINICAL MONITORING 
N/A 
10.1.[ADDRESS_319329], data collection, documentation and 
completion.  Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented as follows:  
 Screening and recruitment data will originate in the EHR  (see Section 10.1.9, Data Handling and Record 
Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and will ultimately be entered into the study database in REDCap. To ensure accuracy , site staff will 
compare a representative sample of source data against the database, targeting key data points in that review.  
 Protocol Deviations  – The study team will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will implement 
corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a level of concern.  
 Should independent monitoring become necessary, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_262600]/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_22866], and inspection by [CONTACT_3482].

[IP_ADDRESS] DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
[ADDRESS_319331] of surgeon emotional support on treatment choices for low -risk thyroid cancer: a randomized hypothetical choice 
experiment  
Protocol version 11/8/21  
 Data collection will be the responsibility of the clinical trial staff under the supervision of the principal 
investigator. The investigator will be responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
 For this study t here will be no hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_156837], study visit worksheets, or CRFs. As the study is completed 
by [CONTACT_262636], all data for baseline measures and outcome measures will be entered into 
Qualtrics by [CONTACT_262637].   
 Screening and recruitment data will be recorded  by [CONTACT_262638] (Research Electronic Data Capture) , 
a [ADDRESS_319332] protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data relevant to screening and 
recruitment will be entered directly from the EMR.  
 
REDCap and Qualtrics both provide export procedures for seamless data downloads to Excel and common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R).  
[IP_ADDRESS] STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
Study documents will be retained for a minimum of 3  years after the date of Federal Financial Report (FFR) 
submission. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the funding agency, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the funding agency to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be 
retained.  
10.1.10 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS   
This protocol defines a protocol deviation as any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol or  International 
Council on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either 
on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions will 
be developed and implemented promptly.  
 These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• Section 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, subsections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• Section 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, subsection 5.1.1  
• Section 5.[ADDRESS_319333] (IRB) per their policies. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_262601].

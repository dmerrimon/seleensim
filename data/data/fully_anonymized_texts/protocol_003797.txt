1.0      PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND SCHEMA  
 
This is a phase  2 intention -to-treat study  of salvage  chemotherapy  followed  by [CONTACT_798262]  (HSCT)  for the treatment  of primary -refractory  or relapsed  
Hodgkin  Lymphoma  (HL).  The primary  aim is to obtain  a preliminary  estimate  of the progression - 
free survival at [ADDRESS_1100961]  all 3 risk factors  (B-symptoms;  extranodal  
sites of disease;  disease  remission  < one year after first-line therapy),  or those  who have  2 risk 
factors  and remain  PET+  after salvage  chemotherapy,  or those  with primary  progressive  disease,  
or those  who have  failed  platinum -based chemotherapy.  In addition,  patients  who relapse  no 
earlier  than [ADDRESS_1100962]  
regimens.  Alternatively,  patients  may also be treated  on ongoing  MSKCC  phase  I or II studies  
specific for Hodgkin  Lymphoma.  
 
Patients  who 1) do not progress  on salvage  chemotherapy,  and 2) have both suitable  HSC  donors  
and 3) a satisfactory  pre-allograft  work -up will proceed  to allograft.  Patients  who fail any of these  
3 criteria  will be off-study  and considered  treatment  failures  for the purposes  of the intention –to- 
treat study.  
 
Patients  referred  with responsive  or stable  disease  after receiving  salvage  chemotherapy  or who 
require  more  than one second -line combination  chemotherapy  regimen,  will not be included  in the 
intention -to-treat analysis  of the  study  but can proceed to  allograft  on protocol if they  are suitable  
candidates.  While  they will contribute  to the allograft  outcome  data,  they will not be part of the 
primary  efficacy  analysis  described  below.  It is anticipated  that approximately  [ADDRESS_1100963]  stable  disease  or are in PR will receive  a reduced  intensity  preparative  
regimen  of Melphalan  and Fludarabine  (Mel/Flu).  
- Patients  in CR will receive  a non-myeloablative  preparative  regimen  of Cyclophosphamide,  
Fludarabine and  low dose  total body  irradiation  (Cy/Flu/TBI).  
 
Hodgkin’s  relapse  or disease  progression  will be defined  using  CT and PET criteria.  Complete  
remission  is defined  as resolution  of all disease  related  symptoms  and normalization  of PET scan 
and of bone  marrow  involvement  on morphologic  exam.  Partial  remission  (PR)  is ≥ 50% decrease  
in the sum of product  of diameters  (SPD)  of the [ADDRESS_1100964]  dominant  lymph  nodes  and of sites of 
organ  involvement,  no increase  in size  or number  of involved  lymph  nodes  or organs,  decrease  in 
PET avidity.  Stable  disease  (SD)  is less than PR but is not progressive  disease.  Progressive/  
relapsed  disease  (PD)  is appearance  of a new lesion  ≥50%  increase  in SPD of more  than one node  
or in greatest  diameter of any  previously  identified node  >1 cm in its short axis.

Tacrolimus,  Sirolimus  and Methotrexate  for related  or unrelated  donors,  and cyclosporine -A 
(CSA)  and mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  for UCB.  In the absence  of GVHD,  withdrawal  of 
immune  suppression  in patients  who proceed  to allograft  with less than a PR will be done  more

Biostatistics  will be based  on a sample  size of 30 patients  (24 on ITT study,  and 6 transplanted  
without  salvage  therapy  administered  on protocol)  and it is anticipated  that approximately  [ADDRESS_1100966]  would  be considered  worthy  of further  study  in this patient  population  if 8 or more  
successes  from  the 24 patients  were  observed.  This two-stage  design  has power  0.90 if the

2.1 OBJECTIVES AND  SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
2.2 Primary  Objectives  
 
Patients  with Hodgkin  Lymphoma  (HL)  relapsed  post-autograft  are not able to be cured  with 
standard  chemotherapy  regimens.  In addition,  a subset  of relapsed  and primary -refractory  
patients  with HL fare poorly  with conventional  autologous  transplant.  Such  patients  may benefit  
from  allogeneic  transplantation  secondary  to a graft -versus -malignancy  (GVM)  effect1-7. This 
protocol  investigates  an intention -to-treat approach  to such patients  with salvage  chemot herapy  
followed  by [CONTACT_798264]  (HSCT)  for the treatment  of high- 
risk or  relapsed  HL. 
 
The primary  aim of this study  is to obtain  a preliminary  estimate  of the progression -free survival  
at [ADDRESS_1100969].

3.[ADDRESS_1100977] 15 years,  several  clinical  trials  using  high dose chemotherapy  or chemoradiotherapy  
with autologous  stem  cell transplantation  (ASCT)  in this setting  have  been  reported,  and 
approximately  40% of patients  appear  to be cured  using this  approach.[ADDRESS_1100978] -dose second -line chemotherapy  with high dose therapy  (HDT)  and ASCT  
have  been reported.9,10 Each  study  demonstrated  a statistically  significant  improvement  in both 
event -free and progression  free survival  for the patients treated  on the  HDT  arms,  but neither  was 
powered  to show an overall  survival  advantage.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_798233]/ASCT, more  than 
50% of patients  fail this approach;  median survival of these patients  is 15  months.  
3.3 Chemosensitive  disease  is required  to achieve  benefit  from  HDT/ASCT  
 
The importance  of pre-transplant  cytoreduction  with salvage  therapy  (ST) has been  demonstrated  
in numerous  series.  In 1991,  we reported  our results  using high dose combined  modality  therapy  
in patients  with biopsy -confirmed  relapsed  and primary  refractory  HL in our first generation  
programs  (MSKCC  protocols  85-97 and 86-86). The program  utilized  accelerated  fractionation  
radiotherapy  either  as total lymphoid  irradiation (TLI)  or as an involved  field (IFRT)  followed  by 
[CONTACT_798265].  One hundred  and fifty-six patients  were  
treated;  chemosensitive  disease  was not a requirement  for transplantation  however  patients  were  
given  non-uniform  second -line standard  dose chemotherapy  with the hope  of debulking  disease  
pre-ASCT.  At a median  follow -up of 11 years  the EFS is 45% with no relapses  occurring  later 
than [ADDRESS_1100979].  After  the introduction  of G-CSF,  100 day mortality  decreased  form  
18% to 6%.11,[ADDRESS_1100980] pre-HDT/ASCT  have a marked  improvement  in EFS compared  to 
patients  with refractory  disease  at the time of HDT.  As with aggressive  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma,  
chemosensitive  disease to ST is now required  for transplant  eligibility  in the  [LOCATION_002].

In 2001  we reported  the results  of a comprehensive  program  for 82 patients  with relapsed  and 
refractory  HL (MSKCC  94-68/97 -51).13 All patients  received  uniform  cytoreduction  with 
ifosfamide,  carboplatin  and etoposide  (ICE)  and only responders  were  subsequently  offered  HDT  
and ASCT.  All patients  in this trial had biopsy -proven  relapsed  or refractory  disease,  and our data 
were  analyzed  by [CONTACT_104992] -to-treat.  The Kaplan -Meier  estimate  of the proportion  of patients  who are 
alive,  event -free and analyzed  by [CONTACT_268220] -to-treat at a median  follow -up for surviving  patients  of 
six years  is 55%.  In the subset  of patients  who received  HDT/ASCT  (75 of 82 patients),  the EFS 
is 61%.  The response  rate to ICE was 85% and only 12% of patients  had an inadequate  peripheral  
blood  progenitor  cell (PBPC)  harvest.  In addition,  integrating higher  dose chemotherapy  into the 
transplant  conditioning  regimen  was safe; with a 100 day mortality  of 2.6%.  These  results  compare  
very favorably  with reports  in the literature.  Our program  documents  the feasibility  and efficacy  
of: (1) ICE chemotherapy  as a highly  effective  dose dense/intense  cytoreductive  regimen  in HL 
and (2) integrating  higher dose  radiotherapy  into an ASCT treatment  program.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1100983]  for long-term EFS in patients  with relapsed  
and refractory  HL. In MSKCC  protocol  94-68, Cox regression  analysis  determined  that the factors  
associated  with a poor outcome  pre-ICE chemotherapy  were:  extranodal  sites of disease  (ENS),  p 
<0.001,  initial  response  duration  < 1 year (p = 0.001),  and B symptoms  (p <0.001).  Using  this [ADDRESS_1100984]  group,  65% of the total number  of patients  had 0-1 of these  risk factors.  
This favorable  group  had an EFS of 80% measured  from  initiation  of ICE therapy.  Patients  with 
2 and 3 risk factors fared  less well with an EFS of 34% and 12% respectively.  
 
3.6 Risk -Adapted  therapy  
 
Risk-adapted  therapy  can improve  EFS in patients  with relapsed  and refractory  HL. This 3 factor  
model  was the basis  of our recent  risk-adapted  comprehensive  study  (MSKCC  protocol  98-71). 
The expectation  from  risk-adapted  therapy  is a reduction  in the influence  of risk factor  (RF)  on 
outcome  by [CONTACT_798266].  Our strategy  was to 
intensify  therapy  without  increasing  toxicity  for unfavorable  patients  with multiple  risk factors,  
while  at the same  time,  maintaining  the previous  regimen  used successfully  for the favorable  
cohort.  The primary  endpoint  of this study  was to improve  outcome  by [CONTACT_798267].  In this study  of [ADDRESS_1100985] 
an improved  EFS as compared  to our previous  results.  Patients  with 0 or 1 risk factor  (ENS,  initial  
response  duration  < 1 year or B symptoms  at time of study  enrollment),  group  A, were  treated  
exactly  as those  on the [ADDRESS_1100986]  a 3-year EFS of 46% (95%  CI: 31%-62%);  the 3-year EFS from  the previous  study  
was 27%.  The 3-year EFS for patients  with 3 factors  is 46% (95%  CI: 20%-71%);  the 3-year EFS 
was 10% in our previous  study.  This improved  EFS in patients  with [ADDRESS_1100987], an approach  that is considered  investigational  at the present  time.

chemosensitive  disease  
 
Our prognostic  model  is based  upon  pretreatment  factors;  however,  since almost  all patients  have 
cytoreduction  to “ICE”  chemotherapy,  other  factors,  evaluated  at the time of HDT,  may be 
important.  Reports  by [CONTACT_798268] <  [ADDRESS_1100990]  portended  an improved  survival.  We evaluated  both of these factors  in our 2 
studies  (94-68 and 98-71) and they did not predict  outcome.  Patients  with HL commonly  have  
large  residual  masses  secondary  to underlying  sclerosis  of the tumor  and only a minority  of patients  
achieves  a true CR pre-ASCT.  However  all of our patients  have  functional  imaging,  PET or 
gallium  scanning,  pre and post ICE and we evaluated  the effect  of normalization  of functional  
imaging  pre-ASCT  on outcome.  There  was a marked  survival  advantage  for patients  who 
normalize  their functional  imaging  (FI) pre-ASCT.  For all transplanted  patients  the EFS is 64.3%  
however  the patients  with normal  FI have  an EFS of 76% vs 40% for patients  with abnormal  
imaging  (p <0.0001).  This was most  important  for patients  with favorable  risk factors,  ARM  A, 
where  the EFS is 85% for patients  with normal  FI vs 25 % for patients  with abnormal  FI, p < 
0.0001.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_798235] [ADDRESS_1100991].  We retrospectively  
evaluated  our experience  with two active  agents,  gemcitabine  (G) and vinorelbine  (N, Navelbine),  
given  in combination  for patients  who fail ASCT.  Thirteen  patients  received  GN, median  age 33 
(range  23-46). Patients  had progressed  following  ASCT  (median  7.4 months;  range  2.9-51) and 
had received  3-7+ prior  cytotoxic  regimens.  The median  number  of treatments  for responding  
patients  was 11 (range  5-47); median  follow -up for surviving  patients  is 17.5 months.  9/13 patients  
(69%)  responded  or had stable  disease.  The median  freedom -from -progression  (FFP)  and OS for 
all patients  was 7.4 months  (95%  CI 0.7, 14.1)  and 30.4 months  (95%  CI 5.5, 55). Gemcitabine  
(G), vinorelbine  (N, Navelbine),  and liposomal  doxorubicin  (D) have  been studied  by [CONTACT_798269]  7/15/00  and 12/9/02.  Seventy -six patients  with recurrent  or refractory  HL were accrued  
to this CALGB  Phase  I/II trial of GND.  The objectives  were  to determine  the maximal  tolerated  
dose (MTD),  response  rates,  and toxicity  of this combination.  All patients  had measurable  disease,  
no prior  treatment  with these  agents,  ANC  > 1500  and platelets  >100,000.  Any number  of prior  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_798236].  [ADDRESS_1100992].  Results:  The Phase  I portion  of the study  
identified  G 1000  mg/m2  d1, 8, N 20 mg/m2  D1, 8, and D 15 mg/m2  D1, 8 Q21 days as the MTD.  
Febrile  neutropenia  and mucositis  were  the dose-limiting  toxicities.  A planned  interim  analysis  of 
the Phase  II portion  of the study  showed  overall  response  rates of 58% (95%  exact  CI [0.34,  0.80])  
for the first 19 patients  without  prior  transplant  (8 PR, 3 CR) and 68% (95%  exact  CI [0.44,  0.87])  
for the 19  patients  with prior  transplant  (12 PR, 1  CR).  Complete  toxicity  data is available  for 23

of the 38 interim  analysis  patients.  The regimen  was well tolerated.  Grade  3-4 toxicities  included  
neutropenia  (69%),  thrombocytopenia  (17%),  febrile  neutropenia  (9%),  mucositis  (9%),  and 
pulmonary  (17%).  There  were  no treatment  related  deaths.  They  concluded  that GND  is an active,  
well-tolerated,  non-alkylator  based  regimen  that should  be considered  both in the pre-transplant  
salvage  setting  as well as for patients  relapsing after transplant.  
 
Gemcitabine  has also been  combined  with ifosfamide  and vinorelbine  (IGV)  in patients  with 
relapsed/refractory  HL.14,[ADDRESS_1100994].  
In a recent  report,  32 patients  were  treated  with salvage  chemotherapy  (IGEV,  ifosfamide,  
gemcitabine,  and vinorelbine),  followed  by a tandem  ASCT  (melphalan  200 mg/m2, BEAM).  In 
an intention -to-treat analysis,  the overall  response  rate increased  after each stage  of protocol,  
ranging  from  47% to 65%  and 75% after IGEV,  MEL200,  and BEAM,  respectively.14 
 
3.9 Clinical Results  of Allotransplant  in HL  
 
An alternative  treatment  strategy  for poor risk patients  (pts with all 3 risk factors)  would  require  
investigators  not to offer  HDT  and ASCT  to this subgroup  but instead,  a non-myeloablative  
allogeneic  transplantation  after some  cytoreduction  with ST. Recent  evidence  from  several  groups  
suggests  that here is evidence  of a graft vs. HL effect  after non-myeloablative  allogeneic  
transplantation1. 
 
3.9.[ADDRESS_1100995]  shown  improved  outcomes  and 
decreased  TRM.21-24 Peggs  et al.21 recently  reported  the results  of reduced -intensity  
transplantation  in 49 patients  with multiply  relapsed  Hodgkin's  lymphoma,  90% of whom  had 
progression  of disease  after previous  ASCT.  Non-relapse -related  mortality  was 16.3%  at 730 days 
(7.2%  for patients  who had related  donors  vs 34.1%  for those  with unrelated  donors,  p=0.0206).  
Projected  4 year overall  and progression -free survival  were  55.7%  and 39.0%,  respectively  (62.0%  
and 41.5%  for related  donors).  Eight  of 49 (16%)  had grade  II-IV acute  GVHD  and seven  (14%)  
had chronic  GVHD  before  donor -lymphocyte  infusion.  Sixteen  patients  received  donor - 
lymphocyte infusion  from  3 months  after transplantation  for residual  disease  or progression and  9 
showed  disease  responses  after infusion  (CR=8,  PR=1).  The patients  enrolled  on this clinical  trial 
did not receive  a true non -ablative regimen,  but instead, a  reduced  intensity  conditio ning regimen  
that included  140 mg/m2  of melphalan.  There  is little doubt  that this dose of melphalan  is active  
in the treatment  of HL. Investigators  from  MD Anderson  have  reported  similar  results  with this 
approach.23 
 
3.9.2 Clinical Results  of Non-myeloablative UCBT:  Overall  and in  HL 
 
Results  of unrelated  donor  UCBT  have  demonstrated  that banked  UCB  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_633097]25 and

chronic  GVHD  despi[INVESTIGATOR_798237].[ADDRESS_1100996]  be 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 07 -147 A(12)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1100997] shown  that double  unit UCBT  can be performed  safely  in adults  with 
improved  engraftment  and reduced  TRM  as compared  to historical  single  unit controls.  This 
strategy  therefore  extends  access  to allogeneic  transplantation  and introduces  adult  UCBT  as a 
viable  alternative  to both matched  and mismatched  marrow  transplantation.  Further,  given  the 
relatively  small  cell dose of the engrafting  unit, these  results  raise intriguing  questions  concerning  
the transplant  biology  of this approach.  Therefore,  further  investigation  of double  unit UCBT  is 
warranted.  
 
The University  of Minnesota  has also investigated  non-myeloablative  UCBT,  utilizing  double  unit 
grafts  in those  without  satisfactory  single  units,  to augment  graft cell dose,  in 59 high-risk adults  
(median  age 49 years)  with high-risk or advanced  hematologic  malignancies.30. Patients  received  
cyclophosphamide  50 mg/kg,  fludarabine  200 mg/m2, and 200 cGy TBI (+ anti-thymocyte  
globulin),  with cyclosporine -A and mycophenolate  mofetil,  and either  single  (n = 14) or double  (n 
= 45) 4-6/6 HLA -matched  UCB  units  with a median  total infused  dose of 3.4 x 107 NC/kg.  
Neutrophil  recovery  occurred  at a median  of 8 days (range  5-32). The cumulative  incidence  of 
sustained  donor  engraftment  was 89% (95%CI:  81-97) overall,  and 98% (95%CI:  94-100) in 
patients  with a prior  autograft  or combination  chemotherapy  within  the prior  3 months.  The 
cumulative  incidence  of grade  II-IV acute  GVHD  was 63% (95%CI:  49-77) at day 100, and 
chronic  GVHD  was 28% (95%CI:  16-40) at 1 year,  with a TRM  of 19% (95%CI:  9-29) at day 180. 
Notably,  TRM  was 14% in patients  > 45 years,  24% in patients  with extensive  prior  therapy,  and 
44% in patients  with significant  co-morbidities.  Cox regression  analysis  revealed  that the relative  
risk of TRM  by [CONTACT_4475] 180 was 0.8 (0.2-3.2; p = 0.78),  1.5 (0.4-5.6; p = 0.56)  and 8.0 (2.0-32.0;  p < 
0.01)  in these 3 patient  groups,  respectively.  With a  median  follow -up of  16 months (range 4 -30), 
the probability  of overall  and progression -free survival  was 44% (95%CI:  30-58) and 35% 
(95%CI:  21-49) at [ADDRESS_1100998]  satisfactory  fitness  and reasonable  progression - 
free survival in this high-risk patient  population.  
 
The same  group  also recently  reported  on their experience  in 9 patients  with HL.31 All patients  
sustained  donor  engraftment  by [CONTACT_4475] 60. Cumulative  incidence  of acute  and chronic  GVHD  were  
33% and 11%,  respectively.  TRM at 100 days was 11% and the 2  year PFS was 25% (95%CI:  0- 
55%).  This approach  will be investigated  specifically  in the  treatment  of HL in this protocol.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1100999]  shown  promising  results.  A number  of lessons  can be 
learned  from  our prior  experience  in the treatment  of patients  with relapsed  and primary  refractory  
HL: 
1) 50% of these patients can be cured  with HDT/ASCT;  
2) Chemosensitive  disease is required  to achieve  benefit from  HDT/ASCT;

3) A 3 factor  model  that includes  extranodal  sites of disease  (ENS),  initial  response  duration  
< 1 year, and B symptoms  predicts  outcome  in relapsed  and primary  refractory  HL treated  
with HDT/ASCT;  
4) Risk-adapted therapy  can improve  EFS in patients with relapsed  and refractory  HL; 
5) PET scanning  should be  used to determine response  and eligibility  for transplant;  
6) Recent  evidence  from  several  groups  suggests  that there  is evidence  of a graft vs. HL effect  
after non-myeloablative  allogeneic  transplantation.  
Several  important  questions  remain  to be answered,  including  patient  selection  for ASCT  vs. Allo- 
HSCT  based  on risk factors,  timing  of allo-HSCT,  as well as the intensity  of the conditioning  
regimen.  Finally,  most  allo-HSCT  studies  report  data of the transplant  alone,  but do not report  the 
percentage  of patients  are actually  able to undergo  allo-HSCT  for advanced  lymphoma  or 
leukemia.   The goal of this protocol  is to address  these important  questions.

Adults : Sirolimus  will be given  in a loading  dose of 12 mg orally  on Day –[ADDRESS_1101028]  vomits  within  15 minutes  of an 
oral dose.  
 
Children:  Children  weighing  < 40.0 kg will be given  an oral loading  dose of sirolimus  of 3 mg/m2 
followed  by a daily  oral dose of  1 mg/m2, rounded to the  nearest  full milligram.  
 
Adults  and Children : Tacrolimus  will be given  at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg  every  24 hours  as a 
continuous  intravenous  infusion  beginning  on Day –3. Convert  the tacrolimus  to oral dosing  at 2- 
3 times  the total 24-hour intravenous  dose,  split into 2 doses  given  every  12 hours  as soon  as 
clinically  feasible.  
 
 
Methotrexate  will be given  at a dose of 5 mg/m2 intravenously  on days +1, +3 and +6 to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_798246].  The day +1 dose should  not be administered  until 24 hours  after the 
BM or PBSC  infusion.  All doses  of methotrexate  should  be administered  unless  life-threatening  
complications  prevent  administration.  The BMT  attending  will determine  if any MTX  dose 
adjustments  are necessary.  IV folinic  acid is NOT  given  after mini-methotrexate.  
 
Methotrexate  dose adjustment  will be  as follows:  
 
HOLD:  for Creatinine  that doubles  from  admission  AND  is >2.0 mg/dl  OR Creatinine  >3.0 mg/dl  
(regardless  of baseline Creatini ne). 
 
HOLD:  for total Bilirubin  > 3.0 mg/dl

MTX  DOSE  ADJUSTMENTS  FOR  WEIGHT:  Use actual  body  weight  for patients  with BSA  < 
2.5 m2, and adjusted  body  weigth  for BSA  > 2.5 m2. 
 
IMMUNESUPPRESSION  WHEN  MTX  IS HELD:  If a dose MTX  is not given,  another  immune  
suppressant  such as MMF  1gm IV q8 hours  must  be instituted.  
 
 
Target  serum levels  and dose modifications  
 
The target serum  level for sirolimus is 3 -12 ng/mL.  
 
Dose  adjustments  are based  on clinical  judgment  of the treating  physician  after considering  clinical  
toxicity,  serum  levels,  GVHD,  concomitant  drug use and the rate of rise or decline  of the serum  
level.  For levels  < 3 ng/mL,  unless  clinically  contra -indicated,  the dose of sirolimus  is to be 
increased  by [CONTACT_3450]  25% increments  no more  frequently  than every  [ADDRESS_1101030]  full milligram  until the target  range  is achieved.  Conversely,  for levels  > 12 ng/mL,  it is 
suggested,  but not required,  that the dose  be decreased  by [CONTACT_3450]  25% no more  frequently  
than every  2 days until the target  level  is achieved.  Alternatively,  sirolimus  can be held entirely  
as long as serum  levels  are monitored  and the drug is restarted  when  the level  returns  to the 
therapeutic  range  and the treating  physician  feels it is appropriate  to restart  the agent.  In patients  
where  therapeutic  levels  cannot  be achieved  or maintained,  alternative  immunosuppressive  drugs  
should be  substituted.  
 
The target serum  level for tacrolimus is 5 -10 ng/mL.  
 
Dose  adjustments  are based  on clinical  judgment  of the treating  physician  after considering  clinical  
toxicity,  serum  levels,  GVHD,  concomitant  drug use and the rate of rise or decline  of the serum  
level.  For levels  < 5 ng/mL,  the dose of tacrolimus  will be increased  by [CONTACT_3450]  25% 
increments  every  1-[ADDRESS_1101031]  0.5 mg (when  dosing  is oral)  until the target  
range  is achieved.  Conversely,  for levels  > 10 ng/mL,  the dose of tacrolimus  will be decreased  by 
[CONTACT_3450]  25% every  1-2 days until the target  level  is achieved.  Alternatively,  tacrolimus  can 
be held entirely  as long as serum  levels  are monitored  and the drug is restarted  when  the level  
returns  to the therapeutic  range  and the treating  physician  feels  it is appropriate  to restart  the agent.  
 
Tapering  
 
Tapering  of sirolimus  and tacrolimus  will begin  at Day 60 in the absence  of GVHD  and disease  
relapse.  The goal of tapering  is the complete  discontinuation  of immunosuppressant  medications  
by 6 months  or earlier  if patients  are in CR at transplant  work -up (see below).  Sirolimus  and 
tacrolimus  should  be tapered  in an alternating  fashion  every  other  week  when  clinically  feasible.  
Similar  reductions  in dosages  should  be employed  for each drug at each tapering  event,  with 
modifications  at the end of the tapering  schedule  to allow  near simultaneous  discontinuation  of 
sirolimus and tacrolimus.

GVHD prophylaxis  will be with Cyclosporin  A and MMF.  
 
Day  
-3 Start  CSA/MMF  
0 Transplant  
 
Patients  will receive  GVHD  prophylaxis  with 2 drugs  as follows:  
 
• Cyclosporine  A (CSA)  beginning  on day -3 maintaining  a level  of 200-400 mg/L.  The 
initial  dose will be 2.5 mg/kg  IV every  12 hours,  over 2-4 hours  as per MSKCC  guidelines.  
• Dose  adjustments  should  be made  on the basis  of toxicity  and low CSA  levels  with a trough  
level  of < 200 mg/L.  
• Once  the patient  can tolerate  oral medications  and has a normal  gastro -intestinal  transit  
time, CSA can be converted to an oral form.  
• Patients  will receive  CSA  for approximately  6 months.  If no history  or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_798248],  the dose should  then be tapered  with monitoring  for development  of GVHD  and 
aiming  to be off immunosuppression  by 9-12 months after transplant  if possible.  
• Patients  intolerant  of CSA  due to renal  impairment  or other  toxicity  aim for a lower  level  
if possible.  This can be done  at the discretion  of the treating  physician.  If unable  to tolerate  
they may require tapering  of CSA before MMF.  
• Patients  unable  to tolerate  CSA  due to renal  impairment  or other  toxicity  should  be 
considered  for an alternative  immunosuppressant  in addition  to mycophenolate  mofetil  as 
per MSKCC guidelines.  
• In case of major  CSA  toxicity  (eg CNS  neurotoxicity  documented  by [CONTACT_9268]),  CSA  should  
be discontinued.  Patients  may be re-challenged  at a later date if clinically  appropriate.  
• For patients  with GVHD,  CSA  may be continued  for longer  time periods  according  to 
standard  of care guidelines.  
• If disease  progression  or persistence  occurs,  or the patient  is considered  to be at very high 
risk of relapse,  early  taper  or cessation  of CSA  can be considered  with close  observation  
for GVHD.  
 
• Mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  should  begin  on day –3 at a dose of 1 gram  IV q8 hours  
for patients  who are  > 50 kg.  For patients  < 50 kg, give 15 mg/kg  IV q8 hours.  
• MMF  from  day -3 to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47850]  (must  be at least day +14)  should  be IV. In 
preparation  for discharge,  switch  to oral route  (CellCept  or generic  mycophenolate  mofetil,  
same  dosing as IV) and round to tablet  size. 
• No dose adjustments  for renal  or liver disease  are needed  routinely  unless  severe  organ  
dysfunction.  
• Measurements  of serum  blood  levels  of MMF  should  be done  routinely  as per current  
MSKCC  guidelines  to guide  assessment  of potential  MMF  toxicity  in the event  of 
unexpected  myelosuppression.  
• If patient  > +28 days and without  neutrophil  engraftment,  consideration  can be made  to 
reduce  dosing  to q12 after discussion  with PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768]-PI. See MSKCC  guidelines  for further  
information  about MMF  levels.

• If no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_798249],  MMF  can be tapered  at approximately  75-[ADDRESS_1101034]- 
transplant.  Keep  the q8 dosing  and taper  at 10-25% decrements.  The aim to be off the drug 
by [CONTACT_3450]  4-6 months.  
• Patients  who are intolerant  of MMF  due to myelosuppression  may require  earlier but slow  
taper  at the treating  physician’s  discretion.  Do not abruptly  stop the drug unless  life- 
threatening  toxicity  is suspected.  
• If the patient  is intolerant  of CSA, MMF  taper  may be delayed.  
• If the patient  has acute GVHD  requiring  systemic  therapy,  MMF  should  only be tapered  if 
control  of GVHD  has been obtained  (eg resolution  of skin rash,  vomiting,  and diarrhea),  
unless significant  toxicity  is attributed  to MMF.  
• If disease  progression  or persistence  occurs,  or the patient  is considered  to be at very high 
risk of relapse,  early  taper  or cessation  of MMF  can be considered  with close  observation  
for GVHD.  
 
For all patients  (RD,  URD, UCB)  
 
For patients  with GVHD,  immunosuppression  may be continued  for longer  time periods  according  
to clinical  care guidelines.  
 
In patients  not in CR prior  to transplant,  or if disease  progression  occurs,  early  taper  or cessation  
of immunosuppression  can be considered  with close  observation  for GVHD.  
 
 
 
9.7 Infusion of Sibling  and Unrelated  Volunteer  Grafts  
 
Beginning  5-6 days before  the day of transplant,  the normal  donor  will receive  10 mcg/kg  of G- 
CSF,  administered  subcutaneously daily  for at least 5 days.  On the fifth and sixth  days,  the donor  
will undergo  daily  leukapheresis  designed  to provide  109 mononuclear  cells per kilogram  of 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_733225].  Mononuclear  cell fractions  will be pooled  as collected,  and will be assayed  
for CD34+  cell enumeration  per standard  procedures.  The targeted  dose of CD34+  donor  PBPC  to 
be infused  is at least 5x106 cells/kg.  
 
If donor  and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_798250],  appropriate  red blood  cell and/or  plasma  depletion  
will be performed.  Thereafter,  collected  donor  PBPC  will be transfused  by [CONTACT_25726],  after 
suitable  premedication  as appropriate.  Vital  signs  are to be obtained  and documented  before  and 
after the infusions, and monitored during  infusions  as appropriate.  
 
9.8 UCB  Thaw  and Administration  
 
• UCB  grafts  will be received  at the MSKCC  Cytotherapy  Laboratory  prior  to the start of 
the preparative regimen.  
• Units  will be thawed  by [CONTACT_798278]  (SOPs)  and release  criteria.  As per standard  practice,  ABO  blood  
group,  total nucleated  cells (TNC),  CD34+  and CD3+  cell number  and viability,  sterility  
and colony -forming  units  (CFU)  will be  measured  post-thaw.

• Units  should  be administered  immediately  upon  arrival  to the patient  care unit by [CONTACT_798279] a BMT  attending  physician.  UCB  
infusion nursing guidelines  should be  followed.  
• Units should be  given  consecutively  as per nursing  guidelines.  
• Pre-medication  should  include  acetaminophen  and diphenhydramine  or hydroxyzine  dosed  
as appropriate  for patient  age. Do not give Hydrocortisone.  Anti-emetics  may be necessary  
and can be given  prn. 
• IV hydration  equal  to twice standard  maintenance should be  given  for [ADDRESS_1101036] UCB  graft infusion  with close  monitoring  of fluid  balance,  per 
MSKCC guidelines.  
• IV Hydralazine  should be  used to treat hypertension associated  with UCB  infusion, if  
necessary.  
 
Following  infusion  the bag and tubing  from  each UCB  unit must  be submitted  to the Microbiology  
Laboratory.  Specimen  for Diagnostic  Molecular  Pathology  will be forwarded  by [CONTACT_798280].

NK cells (which  is a standard  of care and billable).  In addition,  studies  of T regulatory  cells,  
NK-T and dendritic  cells will be performed  (research  non-billables).  This can be performed  on 
8 million cells.  
 
• Mixed  lymphocyte  cultures  between  the patient  and each unit, and each unit against  the other  
([CONTACT_798300]’s  Laboratory).  This can be  performed on 5 million mononuclear  cells.  
 
• Analysis  of the Killer  Ig-like receptor  (KIR)  genotype  to assess  if NK alloreactive  cells are 
involved  in unit predominance  ([CONTACT_362666]’s Laboratory).  This will be performed  on 
the post Ficoll  cell pellet  and 34- cells not required  by [CONTACT_798281]’s  laboratory.  
 
• Assessment  of stem  cell potential  of each UCB  ([CONTACT_798301]’s  Laboratory).  This will 
be performed  on approximately  10-20 million mononuclear  cells.  
 
As a maximum  of 5% of each unit will be used for research,  these  studies  may be limited  by [CONTACT_633135].  If the post thaw  infused  TNC  is less than 1 x 107/kg per unit no cells 
will be  taken  from either  unit for  research  purposes. Above  if > 1, a maximum of 5%  of each unit 
will be taken.  Experiments  will be prioritized  by [CONTACT_798282].  Flow  cytometry  will take priority  followed  by a sample  of mononuclear  cells 
for [CONTACT_798302]  with the post Ficoll  pellet  going  to [CONTACT_798303]. Remaining  cells will go to [CONTACT_798281]’s

in consultation with the  MSKCC transplant  physician,  may assist with follow -up. 
 
Chronic  GVHD  will be diagnosed  and graded  according  to current  MSKCC  guidelines.  
Assessments  will be obtained  at approximately  day 100, [ADDRESS_1101047] of  care.

11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
11.2 Toxicity  Grading  
Toxicities will be  graded  on a scale  of 0 to 4 as described  by [CONTACT_6812] - Common Terminology  for 
Adverse  Events (CTCAE), version  3.0. 
 
 
 
11.1 Total Body Irradiation  (TBI)  
Likely  
• The dose of TBI in this regimen  is very low and therefore  the side-effects  that are associated  
with high doses  of radiation  should be  minimal.  At the dose  of radiation  in this study  mild 
nausea  and vomiting,  diarrhea,  mucositis,  fever,  transient  erythema  may occur  but should  
be mild and can be treated symptomatically.  
• Radiation  contri butes  to the immune  suppression  induced  by [CONTACT_798283].  This is a major  toxicity  of the preparative  regimen  and is 
treated  by [CONTACT_798284].  
 
Less  likely  
• High  doses  of radiation  in combination  with high dose chemotherapy  may contribute  to 
damage  to vital organs  such as the lung or the liver.  This is sometimes  associated  with 
myeloablative  conditioning  and is not attributable  to one specific  agent.  Such  toxicity  is 
highly  unlikely  with the  doses  in this protocol.  
• Late effects  include  cataracts,  second  malignancies  and hypothyroidism  and are possible  
but unlikely  due to the low radiation  dose.  Hypothyroidism  will be routinely  monitored  
post transplant  and treated  with hormonal  replacement  as indicated.  Radiation  could  
contribute  to the risk for sterility  that is primarily  from  chemotherapy.  The risk increases  
with the  number  of years  since  puberty.  
 
Dose  Modifications  
• There  are no dose  modifications.  
 
11.2 Cyclophosphamide  
Likely  
• Nausea  and vomiting:  virtually  all patients  will experience  nausea  and vomiting  after 
intravenous  cyclophosphamide.  This can be significantly  diminished  with anti -emetics.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 07 -147 A(12)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1101049]-2022  
- 29 -  
  
 
• Diarrhea:  most  patients  develop  some  diarrhea  in the first week  post cyclophosphamide.  
This is treated  symptomatically.  
• Myelosuppression  and immune  suppression  is a major  toxicity  and is treated  by [CONTACT_798285].  
• Alopecia  is always  seen but is usually  reversible.  
• Late effects  include  sterility.  
 
Less  Likely  
• Hemorrhagic  cystitis  is a potential  complication  and can be variable  in severity.  Severe  
cystitis  is unlikely.  The risk of cystitis  will be reduced  by [CONTACT_798286] a high 
volume  fluid  flush  during  and 24 hours  after drug administration.  Fluid  weight  gain and 
edema  is associated  with this fluid  flush  but is transient  and can be treated  with diuretics  if 
necessary.  
• Syndrome  of inappropriate  anti-diuretic  hormone  (SIADH)  can be seen but is transient  and 
will spontaneously  resolve  after drug administration.  
Rare but serious  
• Cardiomyopathy  has been described  with cyclophosphamide  but is very  rare. 
 
Dose  Modifications  
• There  are no dose  modifications.  
 
11.3 Fludarabine  
Likely  
• Fludarabine  may contribute  to nausea,  vomiting,  mouth  sores,  and diarrhea  which  are 
primarily  due to the  cyclophosphamide.  
• Jaundice  and elevations  of liver enzymes  have  also been  described.  
• Immune  suppression  is a major  toxicity  and is treated  by [CONTACT_798287].  
 
Less  likely  
• Temporary  erythema  and desquamation  
 
Rare but serious  
• Effects  on the nervous  system  are rare, but if they occur  could  include  confusion,  coma,  
weakness  or numbness,  loss of balance,  difficulty  walking,  or loss of vision  and could  be 
very serious  or lethal.  
 
Dose  Modification  
• The dose will be  modified based  on Creatinine  clearance as  noted  in section 9. 
 
11.4 Melphalan  
Likely  
• Bone marrow  suppression, complete  ablation  (bone  marrow  ablation  is expected).  
• Gastrointestinal:  Nausea,  vomiting,  anorexia,  diarrhea,  stomatitis,  esophagitis,  colitis  
• Alopecia

- 30 -  
  
 
• Fever  
• Transient  liver dysfunction  
• Renal  or bladder  dysfunction (increased  BUN,  creatinine, necrosis)  may be seen.  
 
Less  likely  
• Pulmonary  fibrosis,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_36645],  has been rarely  reported.  
 
Rare But Serious  
• Serious  hypersensitivity  reactions:  Edema,  rash,  anaphylaxis.  
 
Dose  Modifications  
• There  are no dose  modifications.  
 
11.5 Tacrolimus  
• The major  toxicity  of Tacrolimus  is immune  suppression  which  leads to increased  risk for 
infection.  This is managed  with aggressive  supportive  care with both prophylaxis  and 
treatment  of infectious  complications.  
• Renal  dysfunction  is common  and is treated  by [CONTACT_798288].  Electrolyte  abnormalities  involving  potassium  and magnesium  are also 
common  and electrolytes  must be  closely  monitored.  
• Increased  blood pressure is common and is treated  with anti-hypertensive  medication(s).  
• Neurological  side effects:  Tremor  (common),  seizures  (rare),  ataxia,  cortical  blindness  
(rare),  and peripheral  neuropathies.  
• Gastrointestinal  complaints including  anorexia, nausea,  and ileus.  
• Other  potential  side-effects  include  liver toxici ty, hyperglycemia,  hirsutism,  capi[INVESTIGATOR_798255]  (rare),  hemolytic  anemia  (rare),  and thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  
(rare).   In addition  there  is an infusional toxicity  from the  cremaphor  diluent.  .  
 
11.6 Sirolimus  
• The major  toxicity  of Sirolimus  is immune  suppression  which  leads  to increased  risk for 
infection.  This is managed  with aggressive  supportive  care with both prophylaxis  and 
treatment  of infectious  complications.  
• The primary  toxicities  of sirolimus  are hypertriglyceridemia,  hypercholesterolemia,  mild 
thrombocytopenia,  anemia,  leukopenia,  hypokalemia,  elevated  LDH,  arthralgia,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940],  
edema,  and infections.  
• Clinically  significant  elevations  in hepatic  transaminases  without  sequelae  were  noted  in 
the prior studies  with this drug.  However,  the incidence  of veno -occlusive  disease  of the 
liver was not noted to be  higher  than expected  in trials of unrelated  transplantation.  
• A syndrome  of thrombotic  microangiopathy,  comprised  of microangiopathic  hemolytic  
anemia,  thrombocytopenia  and renal  dysfunction  has been described  in association  with 
sirolimus and tacrolimus  use. 
 
11.7 Methotrexate  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 07 -147 A(12)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1101051]-2022  
- 31 -  
  
 
• Renal  dysfunction:  Decrease  in creatinine  clearance,  renal  wasting  of magnesium  and 
calcium,  hypertension.  Hypertension  may be exacerbated  by [CONTACT_798289].  
• Hepatic  dysfunction:  Elevation  in serum  bilirubin  and occasionally  in serum  
transaminases.  
• Mucositis:  Mucositis  secondary  to the  cytoreduction  may be potentiated  following  the use  
of methotrexate  post transplant.  
 
11.8 Mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  
• The major  toxicity  of MMF  is immune  suppression  which  leads  to increased  risk for 
infection.  This is managed  with aggressive  supportive  care with both prophylaxis  and 
treatment  of infectious  complications.  
• Other  potential  side-effects  include  myelosuppression,  headache,  insomnia,  aches  and 
pains,  rash,  nausea,  anorexia and diarrhea.  
• There  are no dose  modifications.  
• There  is also a very rare side effect  known  as Progressive  Multifocal  Leukoencephalopathy  
(PML),  which  is a progressive  disease  of the nervous  system  that can cause  severe  
disability  or death.  A very small  number  of cases  of PML  have  been reported  in patients  
treated  with MMF.  PML  can cause  hemiparesis,  apathy,  confusion,  cognitive  deficiencies  
and ataxia.  
 
11.9 Cyclosporine -A (CSA)  
• The major  toxicity  of CSA  is immune  suppression  which  leads  to increased  risk for 
infection.  This is managed  with aggressive  supportive  care with both prophylaxis  and 
treatment  of infectious  complications.  
• Renal  dysfunction  is common  and is treated  by [CONTACT_798288].  Electrolyte  abnormalities  involving  potassium  and magnesium  are also 
common  and electrolytes  must be  closely  monitored.  
• Increased  blood pressure is common and is treated  with anti-hypertensive  medication(s).  
• Neurological  side effects  include  tremor  (common),  seizures  (rare),  confusion,  ataxia,  
cortical  blindness  (rare),  and peripheral  neuropathies  and are usually  reversible  with 
cessation  of the  medication.  
• While  mild to moderate  microangiopathic  hemolysis  is relatively  common,  serious  
thrombotic thrombocytopenic  purpura (TTP)  is rarely  seen.  
• Gastrointestinal  side-effects  include anorexia  and nausea,  swollen  gums,  and 
hyperbilirubinemia.  
• Skin changes  include  hirsutism and gingival  hyperplasia.  
• Dose  may be modified  for evidence of CSA toxicity.  
 
11.10  G-CSF  (Neupogen)  
• Side-effects  of G-CSF are generally  mild, include  bone  pain,  headaches,  body  aches,  
fatigue,  edema  and nausea  and are managed  with supportive  care.  Pleuro - or pericarditis  
are seen rarely  and are managed  by [CONTACT_798290].  
 
11.11  Mesna  (Mesnex®)  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 07 -147 A(12)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1101052]-2022  
- 32 -  
  
 
• Mesna has  no systemic side  effects.  Mesna is a uroprotectant  and is being  used 
concomitantly  with the  high dose  cyclophosphamide.  There are no dose  modifications.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1101053]  and HSC  infusions  
• Infusions  of blood  or HSC  products  may produce  volume  overlo ad which  can be managed  
with diuretics.  They  may also induce  allergic  reactions  of variable  severity,  many  of which  
can be prevented  or mitigated  by [CONTACT_120180],  antihistamines,  and 
narcotics.  These  products  may also transmit  serious  infections  (e.g.,  CMV,  hepatitis,  HIV).  
To circumvent  this, donors  are screened  according  to AABB  and FACT  guidelines.  CMV  
antibody  negative  blood  products  will be used in CMV  seronegative  individuals  whenever  
possible.  All blood  products  (other  than the HSC  graft)  are irradiated  to circumvent  the risk 
of GVHD  caused  by [CONTACT_362652].  
• Toxicities  potentially  associated  with the infusion  of the thawed  UCB  graft include  DMSO  
toxicity  and side effects  from  red cells and may include  changes  in heart  rate or rhythm,  
changes  in blood  pressure,  fever,  chills,  sweats,  nausea/vomiting,  diarrhea,  abdominal  
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  headache,  dyspnea,  presence  of DMSO  taste and odor,  hemoglobinuria,  and 
acute  renal  failure.  However  due to hydration  and pre-medication,  severe  toxicities  are 
unlikely.  
 
The definitions  and reporting  of serious  adverse events  (SAEs)  is defined in  Section  17.2.  
 
12.1 CRITERIA FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
12.2 Primary  Endpoint  
 
The primary  end-point  of this study  is the progression -free survival  (survival  without progression  
of malignant  disease  from  what  is present  at pre-HSCT  disease  staging)  at 1 year.  Subsequent  
survival  will be monitored  as a secondary  endpoint. Other  important outcomes include:  
 
12.3 Failure of Neutrophil  Recovery  and/or Donor Engraftment  
 
As this is a reduced  intensity  or NMA  allograft  protocol  neutrophil  recovery after  transplants  and 
donor  engraftment  are not synonymous  and must  be considered  separately.  The following  
definitions  will be used:  
 
• The day of neutrophil  recovery  is the 1st day of 3 consecutive  days of absolute  neutrophil  
count  (ANC)  at or above  [ADDRESS_1101054]-UCBT nadir.  
• Donor  chimerism  will be defined  as either  partial  (10-89% donor)  or complete  (> 90% 
donor)  and should  be recorded  as to whether  it is sampled  from  the patient's  marrow  or 
peripheral  blood.  In the case of UCBT,  record  which  UCB unit engrafts  (by [CONTACT_633143]).  
If both UCB  donors  engraft,  the total donor  chimerism  (contribution  of each donor  added  
together)  as well as the contribution of each donor  individually  should be  documented.  
• Primary  graft  failure  = no neutrophil  recovery  by [CONTACT_4475] 42 (regardless  of donor  chimerism)  
or autologous  recovery  (ANC recovery  but < 10%  donor  in blood and BM)  by [CONTACT_4475] 42. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 07 -147 A(12)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1101055]-2022  
- 33 -  
  
 
• Secondary  graft  failure  = loss of ANC  to < 500/µL  for 14 consecutive  days after initial  
recovery  or loss of donor  chimerism  to < 10% donor  after primary  donor  engraftment  has 
been  achieved  not due to  progressive malignancy  within the marrow.  
• Successful  primary  donor  engraftment  = neutrophil  recovery  within  the first 42 days after 
transplant  and partial/complete  donor  chimerism  (> 10%).  
• Successful  sustained  donor  engraftment  = successful  primary  donor  engraftment  without  
subsequent  graft failure  beyond  42 days.  This will be reported  along  with the median  
(range)  of total donor chimerism  at serial  time points post -UCBT.  
Patients  with suspected  graft  failure  will be evaluated  with bone  marrow  biopsy  to assess  BM 
cellularity  and assess  for residual  or recurrent  disease,  culture  for viral pathogens  potentially  
causing  graft failure  including  CMV  and HHV6, and molecular  analyses  of marrow.  Patients  who 
suffer  failure  of donor  engraftment  will be managed  with supportive  care if they  have  autologous  
recovery  and adequate  hematopoiesis,  or re-infused  with autologous  cryopreserved  stem  cells (if 
available)  or a second HSC graft if they  are aplastic.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1101056]  Disease (GVHD)  
 
Acute  GVHD  is manifested  by [CONTACT_362656],  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea  and ulceration  of the 
intestines,  hyperbilirubinemia  and hepatitis,  and suppressed  or delayed  recovery  of the 
hematopoietic  and immune  system.  Standard  clinical  criteria,  and histological  grading  of skin,  
liver or gastrointestinal  pathology  where  possible,  will be used to establish  and grade  acute  GVHD.  
 
In the first 100 days after transplant  patients  will be assessed  by a transplant  physician  for the 
development  of acute  GVHD  approximately  weekly.  Data  will be collected  approximately  every  
2 weeks  to characterize  the severity  of symptoms  and signs  caused  by [CONTACT_798291].  Data  collection  will include  descriptive  characteristics  of rash and 
estimated  body  surface  area involved,  extent  of dermal/epi[INVESTIGATOR_93037],  identification  of 
concomitant  causes  of increased  bilirubin  other  than GVHD,  presence  or absence  of nausea,  
vomiting  or anorexia  persistent  after engraftment,  peak  diarrhea  volume  with annotations  
concerning  the presence  or absence  of urinary  mixing  and estimates  of true diarrhea  volume,  
presence  of abdominal  cramps  or frank  blood  in the stool  or melena,  concomitant  causes  of GI 
symptoms  other  than GVHD,  biopsy  results,  identification  of any agents  used for treatment  and 
autopsy  results if applicable.  
 
Patients  with moderate  to severe  acute  GVHD  (grade  II-IV) will be treated  in standard  fashion  
with high-dose IV methylprednisolone  as per standard  of care.  Patients  failing  to respond  to 
steroids  will be considered  for treatment  with standard  or experimental  immunosuppressive  agents.  
 
Chronic  GVHD  is characterized  to varying  degrees  by [CONTACT_362657],  
scleroderma -like changes  of the skin,  chronic  inflammation  and scarring  of the gastrointestinal  
tract with consequent  malabsorption  and diarrhea,  inflammation  of the liver,  suppression  of the 
immune  system  and occasionally  other  auto-immune  phenomena  (eg auto-immune  hemolysis)  or 
involvement  of other organs  (eg pulmonary  involvement).  Chronic  GVHD  will be diagnosed  and 
graded  according  to the criteria  of Sullivan  and treated  with standard  or experimental  
immunosuppressive  therapy.  Patients  will be assessed  for chronic  GVHD  at day 100, 6 months  
and annually  after transplant,  and more frequently  if clinically  indicated.

12.5 Transplant related  mortality  (TRM)  
 
TRM  is defined  as death  at any time from  the commencement  of pre-transplant  conditioning  due 
to any cause  other  than disease  relapse  with the exception  of automobile  or other  accidents.  The 
incidence  of TRM  at day [ADDRESS_1101058]  is in 
excess  of 35%.  
 
12.6 Disease Relapse or Progression  
 
Relapse  of malignancy,  or progression  of disease  from  the base-line documented  pre-allo 
transplant,  is a secondary  endpoint  of this study  and will be defined  by [CONTACT_798292][INVESTIGATOR_633109] 5%, by [CONTACT_798293],  pathologic  lymphadenopathy  or by [CONTACT_798294]. 
Radiologic  studies,  flow cytometric  analysis  or molecular  studies  of the marrow  and/or  peripheral  
blood,  and/or  biopsy  of lymph  nodes  or other  sites may also be obtained  for the diagnosis  of relapse  
or disease progression.  
 
Hodgkin’s  relapse or disease  progression  will be  defined  using  CT and PET criteria:  
 
Complete  remission  is defined  as resolution  of all disease  related  symptoms  and normalization  of 
PET scan and of bone  marrow  involvement  on morphologic  exam.  
 
Partial  remission  (PR)  is ≥ 50% decrease  in the sum of product  of diameters  (SPD)  of the [ADDRESS_1101059]  dominant lymph  nodes  and of sites of organ  involvement,  no increase in size  or number  of 
involved  lymph  nodes or  organs,  decrease in PET avidity.  
 
Stable  disease  (SD)  is less than PR but is not progressive disease.  
 
Progressive/  relapsed  disease  (PD)  is appearance  of a new lesion  ≥50%  increase  in SPD of more  
than one  node  or in greatest  diameter  of any previously  identified  node  >1 cm in its short axis.  
 
12.7 Immunologic Recovery  
 
Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_120133] T-cells,  B-cells,  and NK cells,  and T-cell proliferations  in response  to non- 
specific  mitogens  and specific  antigens,  will be performed  at serial  time points  after transplant  to 
measure  immune  recovery.  At approximately  60 days ([ADDRESS_1101060]-transplant)  these  will be 
performed  only in UCB  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_798256] -making.  From  4 months  these  studies  will guide  clinical  decisions  in terms  of 
continuation  of prophylactic  antibiotics  and are therefore  both clinically  indicated  and billable.  
Patients  will receive  supplemental  IV immunoglobulin  (Ig) to prevent  infection  for at least [ADDRESS_1101061]  donor  and possibly  longer  if IgG levels  are <

IRB Number: 07 -147 A(12)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1101062]- 
transplant  and the  response  to vaccination  will be  documented.  
 
13.0    CRITERIA FOR  REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
If at any time the patient  is found  to be ineligible  for the protocol  as designated  in the section  on 
Criteria  for patient/subject  eligibility  (eg a change  in diagnosis),  the patient  will be  removed  from  
the study.  Participants  may be removed  from  the study  if at any time it is determined  to be in the 
participant’s  best interest  to do so. Also  patients  may be removed  from  the study  if requested  by 
[CONTACT_102].  Management  will depend  on where  they are in their treatment  course.  Such  patients  
will receive  appropriate supportive  care.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_1101063]  stable  disease  or 
are in PR will receive  a reduced  intensity  preparative  regimen  of Melphalan  and Fludarabine  
(Mel/Flu).  Patients  in CR will receive  a non-myeloablative  preparative  regimen  of 
Cyclophosphamide,  Fludarabine  and low dose  total body  irradiation (Cy/Flu/TBI).  
 
This is a revision  of a phase  [ADDRESS_1101064]  in patients  with high-risk or relapsed  Hodgkin  Lymphoma.  In 
response  to the slow  accrual,  the original  treatment  strata  A (upfront  patient  not eligible  for 
autologous  transplant)  and B (relapse  after autologous  transplant)  were  merged.  For this study,  a 
patient  will be classified  as a success,  if he or she responds  due to salvage  chemotherapy,  
undergoes  an allogeneic  HSCT,  and remains  progression  free for one year after HSCT.  Currently,  
[ADDRESS_1101065]  or complete  may be transplanted  on this protocol.  While  they will 
contribute  to the allograft  outcome  data,  they will not be part of the primary  efficacy  analysis  
described  above.  It is anticipated  that approximately  6 patients  will be treated  through  this course.

The maximum  sample  size for this study  is anticipated  to be 30 patients  (24 on ITT study,  and 6 
transplanted  without  salvage  chemotherapy  administered  on the protocol).  The accrual  period  will 
be approximately  4-[ADDRESS_1101067] 
follow -up. Kaplan -Meier  estimates  of progression  free and overall  survival  will be computed  for 
subsets  of transplant  patients  (patients  treated  with salvage  chemotherapy  at MSKCC  and all 
transplant  patients),  starting  from  the time of transplant.  For the transplant  subsets,  the time to 
neutrophil  and platelet  engraftment,  and the time to acute  and chronic  GVHD  will be assessed  
using  the cumulative  incidence  function.  Also,  the acute  GVHD  outcome  by [CONTACT_798295].  The reasons  for not receiving  an allograft  (lack  of disease  
response  to chemotherapy,  no donor,  or not fit for allograft  due to treatment  complications)  will 
also be reported.  
 
In order  to reduce  patient  risk, the design  includes  a study  evaluation  boundary  in the event  of 
excessive  day [ADDRESS_1101068] and is summarized in the  table  below.  If the boundary  is crossed,  it will  
be determined  whether  the treatment  related  deaths were composed  of a well-defined  subgroup  of 
patients  (e.g. the conditioning regimen).  If this is found  to be the case,  the eligibility  criteria  for a 
future  study  may be refined to exclude these patients.  
 
Table  – Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_798257] [ADDRESS_1101069] disease,  and the time to infectious  complication,  will be computed  
using  the cumulative incidence  function.  
 
 
 
 
14.3 Laboratory  Studies  
 
Laboratory  research  studies will be  performed  investigating:  
• The determinants  of unit predominance  to facilitate  the understanding  of the biology  of double  
unit UCBT  (see Section  10.5).  The results of  these  studies  will be  correlated  with the  
engraftment  of each unit in the patients  testing  if the laboratory  results  predict  or correlate  with 
unit predominance  in the patient.  The Wilcoxon  rank sum test will be used to test the

continuous  correlates  and the Fisher's  exact  test will be used for the binary  correlates.  The data 
collected  on this protocol  will be analyzed  in aggregate  with other  clinical  protocols  of double  
unit UCBT.  
• Immune  recovery  as measured  by [CONTACT_137766][INVESTIGATOR_120133] T-cells,  B-cells,  and NK cells,  and 
T-cell proliferations  in response  to non-specific  mitogens  and specific  antigens  at serial  time 
points  after transplant.  The results  of these  studies  will be correlated  with serious  infectious  
complications.  The Wilcoxon  rank sum test will be used to test the continuous  correlates  and 
the Fisher's  exact  test will be used for the binary  correlates.

Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_86492],  at a minimum of  two times per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 Data  and Safety Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  were  
approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the new 
policies  set forth  by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  
for Data  and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:  
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm  
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_211148],  safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  
on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two 
institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials  
programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase I and II 
clinical  trials,  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  
report  to the  Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  Review Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for it’s 
level  of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  and 
the monitoring  procedures  will be  established  at the time of  protocol  activation  
 
17.1 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
Risks:  From  the studies  that have  been  done  so far it appears  that allo-HSCT  can safely  be 
performed  in patients  with advanced  HL and that these  patients  may benefit  from  the treatment.  
However,  given  this is a new treatment approach, it  is possible  that there  are side effects  that have 
not yet been seen.  
 
Benefits: The information  from  this study  will help future  cancer patients.  
 
Possible  toxicities/side  effects:  Toxicities  and side effects  of the agents  used are listed  in section  
11 and reporting  of serious adverse  events  is found in section  17.2.  
 
Consent  Process:  Participation  in this study  is voluntary.  All patients  will be required  to sign a 
statement  of informed  consent which must conform  to MSKCC IRB guidelines.  
 
Alternatives:  Alternative  treatment  options  will be presented  to the patient  prior  to taking  part in 
this study.  Alternative  treatment  options  may include  getting  treatment  with either  chemotherapy  
or a transplant  without being  on a study; taking  part in another  study;  or getting  no treatment.

Costs:  The patient’s  health  plan/  insurance  company  will need  to pay for all of the costs  of 
treatment  in this study.  The patient  will be responsible  for the costs  of standard  medical  care,  
including  the allograft,  all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120136].  Pre-authorization  for 
allogeneic  transplant  will be cleared  with the health  plan/  insurance  company  prior  to allograft  
admission.  Patients  will not be paid for taking  part in this study.  Once  the cord blood  units  have 
been  shipped,  the patient’s  health  plan/  insurance  company  will need  to pay for the costs  of the 
units even  if they  are not administered.   Research  tests will be  done  at no cost to the patient.  
 
Confidentiality:  Every  effort  will be made  to maintain  patient  confidentiality.  Research  and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_798258].  
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use  and disclosure  
of protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form  must  be completed  by [CONTACT_11097]  [INVESTIGATOR_209836].  
 
17.2 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
An adverse event  is considered  serious if it results  in ANY  of the  following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disruption  of the ability  to conduct  normal  
life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon medical  judgment,  they may 
jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  
one of  the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an SAE.  
 
SAE  reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is required  for 
30-days after the participant’s  last investigational treatment  or intervention.  Any events  that occur  
after the 30-day period and  that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  must  be 
reported . 
 
If an SAE  requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events’,  the SAE  report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  The 
IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  electronically  to the 
SAE  Office  as follows:

The current  study  includes  two treatment  phases,  salvage  chemotherapy  and HSCT.  All patients  
will be followed  for safety  and toxicity  related  to the study.  Toxicities  will be graded  using  CTC  
guidelines  (v3.0).  This will occur  during  both treatment  phases  of the study.  An adverse  event  is 
any adverse  change  from  the patient’s  baseline  (pretreatment)  condition,  including  any clinical  
status  change  or clinically  significant  laboratory  test value  abnormality  that occurs  during  the 
course  of the clinical  study  whether  it is considered  related  to the treatment or not.  
 
For the 1st treatment  phase  of the study  (salvage  chemotherapy),  elective  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_798259].  Grade  3 or 4 neutropenia  and/or  
thrombocytopenia will not be considered  an adverse  event  unless  its duration exceeds  28 days.  
 
Potentially  serious  toxicities  are an expected  part of transplant  therapy.  However,  for the purposes  
of this study,  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  which  will be reportable  for the second  part of the 
study  (HSCT)  will be defined  according  to the current  MSKCC  BMT  program  guidelines  (Adult  
and Pediatric  BMT  Adverse Event  Reporting  Standard  Operating Procedures,  version  1.0 dated  1 
December  2011).

Patients  recruited  to this study  are individuals  with high-risk or relapsed  HL who are suitable  
allograft  candidates.  Prior  to consideration  for transplant,  all patients  undergo  salvage  
chemotherapy,  either  at MSKCC  or at an outside  institution.  Those  patients  receiving  salvage  
chemotherapy at  MSKCC  are first required  to sign part I of the informed  consent  in order  to take 
part in the intention  to treat portion  of this study.  Patients  who received  salvage  chemotherapy  at 
an outside  institution  do not take part in this aspect  of the study  and are not required  to sign consent  
part I. All patients  who do not have  POD  after salvage  chemotherapy,  and who have  both suitable  
HSC  donors  and a satisfactory  pre-allograft  work -up sign part II of the informed  consent  and 
proceed  to the allograft  portion  of the study.  Patients  who fail any of these  [ADDRESS_1101075] salvage  chemotherapy  assessed  at pre-allograft  work -up. Those  patients  with 
stable  disease  or in PR will be placed  into study  Arm A, the reduced  intensity  preparative  regimen  
of Mel/Flu  and those  in CR will be placed  into study  Arm B, the NMA  preparative  regimen  of 
Cy/Flu/TBI.  Cytoreduction  will be followed  by [CONTACT_798270]  
(sibling  PBSC,  URD HSC  or BM, or UCB).  
 
Prior  to consideration  for this study,  all patients  undergo  a series  of consultations  discussing  the 
risks  and potential  benefits  of salvage  chemotherapy  followed  by [CONTACT_798296]: 07 -147 A(12)

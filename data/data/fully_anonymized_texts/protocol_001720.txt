 TITLE:  A Euglycemic Insulin Clamp Study in Type 1 Diabetic Patients with Oral Insulin 
(ORAMED)  
BACKGROUND :  Insulin therapy is an absolute requirement in type 1 diabetic patients .  
Multiple injections present a barrier to achieving normal/near -normal glucose control in diabetic 
patients ( 1).  Therefore, there has been considerable interest in developi[INVESTIGATOR_711454].  ORAMED has developed an oral ins ulin that, in preliminary studies, has 
shown promise.  In the present study we will perform a p harmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic 
study to evaluate this novel insulin preparation as a potential therapeutic option in diabetic 
patients.  
EXPERIMENTAL PLAN:  
 Subje cts:  10 type 1 diabetic subjects between the ages of 18 to 70, in good general 
health by [CONTACT_711456]; A1c<10.0%; BMI = 18 -40 kg/m2; on no meds 
known to affect glucose metabolism other than insulin; hematoc rit  34 vol%; LFTs <  [ADDRESS_967765]; 
plasma creatinine < 1.8 mg/dl.  
 Study Design :  Each subject will be studied on three occasions with an interval of [ADDRESS_967766] s will receive:  (i) two 8 mg 
ORAMED capsule containing insulin; (i i) three 8 mg ORAMED capsules containing insulin; (iii) 
one 16 mg ORAMED capsule containing insulin .  If the fasting plasma glucose is >200mg/dl on 
the procedure day, the procedure will be rescheduled.  
 Prior to each study subjects will refrain from eating  (except water)  after 10 PM and report 
to the Clinical Research Center at approximately 7 AM.  A catheter will be placed in an 
antecubital vein and a prime (40 uCi x FPG/100) – continuous (0.4 uCi/min) infusion of tritiated 
(3-3H-glucose) glucose will be s tarted and continued until the end of the study.  Plasma glucose 
14-476H, DeFronzo, PI [CONTACT_1738], [ADDRESS_967767] hour of tracer equilibration, a small amount of 
IV regular insulin will be administered to obtain a fasting plasma glucose of 100 -130mg/dl . The 
total amount of administered regular insulin will be <[ADDRESS_967768] the ORAMED capsule containing insulin and a variable infusion of 20% 
glucose will be started to maintain the plasma glucose concen tration between 100 -120 mg/dl.  
Plasma samples for glucose, insulin, glucagon, and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations and 
tritiated glucose radioactivity will be obtained every 5 -15 minutes for 4 hours following the 
ingestion of the ORAMED capsule contai ning insulin.  
 Calculations :  Following an overnight fast, steady state conditions prevail and the basal 
rate of glucose appearance (Ra) equals the rate of glucose disappearance (Rd) and is calculated 
as the tritiated glucose infusion rate (DPPM/min) divided by [CONTACT_711457] 
(DPM/min).  Under postabsorptive conditions, R a primarily reflects hepatic glucose production 
(2).  Following the ingestion of oral insulin, non -steady state conditions prevail and Ra and Rd 
are calculated using Steele’s equation ( 3).  Endogenous (primarily reflects liver) glucose 
production (EGP) is calculated by [CONTACT_711458] -derived Ra.  Rd reflects glucose uptake by [CONTACT_711459], but primarily reflects 
skeletal muscle ( 4). 
 Sample Size :  The present study represents a pi[INVESTIGATOR_711455] (skeletal muscle) glucose 
metabolism.  This information will be used to determine whether the ORAMED oral insulin 
preparation represents a viable option to treat diabetic subjects, to gain information about the  
dose response effect of ORAMED  insulin  on glucose metabolism , and to provide quantitative 
14-476H, DeFronzo, PI [CONTACT_1738], [ADDRESS_967769] of oral insulin on hepatic and per ipheral (muscle) glucose metabolism.  
Therefore, we conservatively  have set the sample size at 10.

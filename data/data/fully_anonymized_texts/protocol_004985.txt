Study Duration :  The expec ted duration of the study for each subject  on each Phase 
is about one day.  
Total Study D uration: TBD 
Expected Subject 
Enrollment: The total expected enrollment is 16 subjects for Phase I and 16 for 
Phase II.  
Study Popul ation: Subjects attending an oral health clinic .  
Study Objectives: The primary objective of this research is to assess the human 
factors in relabeling the SaliPen from a prescription-based device to 
an OTC.  
Primary performance endpoints: 
 The user can select the device properly. 
 The user can use the device as instructed in the IFU.  
Study Design : This will be a single -center, prospective, open -label study.   
Screening: Eligible subjects will be included in the study. 
Test Participant 
Recruitment Plan: Patients visiting the participating clinic will be asked to participate 
in the study sequentially (by [CONTACT_794811]).  
For Phase I, enrollment will be stopped once the goal of eight (8) 
subjects with xerostomia and eight (8) subjects without xerostomia 
has been reached.  
For Phase II, 16 subjects with xerostomia that are evaluated or 
treated at the clinic will be enrolled sequentially (by [CONTACT_794812]). Patients that have participated in Phase I 
and have xerostomia will be invited to participate in Phase II, as 
well. 
Participants will receive $25 cash for participating in either phase of 
this study. Participants in both phases will receive $50 cash.

device they will use in the study. 
Inclusion Criteria: Phase I: Any adult person that is 18 years old or older 
Phase II: Subjects with xerostomia that are 18 years old or older 
 
Exclusion Criteria: Phase I:  
 Children and adolescents (persons under 18 years of age)

 Use of a pacemaker 
 Pregnancy 
 Psychiatric or psychological disorders 
 Involuntary muscle movement disorder (such as Parkinson’s) 
 Neurologic disorder in head and neck area 
Medical Device 
Description:  Electrical salivary stimulator system. 
Study Endp oints: Performance Endpoint s:  
 Correct selection of the product. 
 Product use in accordance with the IFU. 
 
Statistical Analysis A simple descriptive statistical analysis will be utilized to calculate 
the percentage of correct answers and the percentage of subjects 
that passed the evaluation in each phase of the study. 
 
3. Study Objective and Rationale 
3.1. The study objective 
This is a Summative Evaluation aimed at evaluating the use of SaliPen (the study product) as an Over-
The-Count (OTC) device rather than as a prescription device. 
 SaliPen Human Factors Study for OTC 
labeling Page 6 of 18 
Revision 0.5 
 
 
 
 3.2. The study rationale 
• Xerostomia (dry mouth) is the subjective feeling of oral dryness. The diagnosis by [CONTACT_794813]'s feeling.  
• Most patients are elderly, many of them with limited mobility.  
• Nowadays, those patients are at high risk for COVID-19 infection, morbidity and even mortality.  
• The fear of exposure at the practitioner's clinic to obtain an Rx inhibits them from treating their 
xerostomia with the SaliPen.  
• The cost of getting a prescription is an additional burden.  
• The SaliPen is an OTC in other parts of the world for years.  
• The performance of potential American users of an OTC SaliPen device will be evaluated in this 
usability study. 
 
As a result, many patients leave their oral dryness untreated, with the well-known consequences of poor 
oral functions, oral health, daily suffering, and more.  
 
4. Brief Study Description 
This Human Factors Validation Testing will assess user interactions to verify the capability of potential 
users to assess if the study product fits their needs and if they can use it correctly based on the provided 
Information For User (IFU)?  
More specifically, this is a non-comparative case series study and is subdivided into two major parts. 
Those parts are:  
1- Phase I: aimed at testing if, based on the IFU, the potential subjects can decide whether the 
study product is or is not appropriate to treat their condition and, 
2- Phase II: aimed at assessing whether the users can use the study product correctly without 
counseling by a health care provider.

Xerostomia  SaliPen 
 
5. Detailed Study Description 
5.1. Phase I  
To simulate an OTC setting, potential subjects will be requested to read the label text on the outside of 
the study product package (external labeling) and determine whether the study product addresses their 
needs, without a provider direction or assistance.  
 SaliPen Human Factors Study for OTC 
labeling Page [ADDRESS_1096383], will be requested to 
use it with no training, except for their understanding of the User Manual (internal labeling). Those 
subjects will use the study product in a supervised clinical setting. Subjects who report any discomfort 
will be offered the option to pause and remove the device upon such a request. 
Correct use verification will be performed by [CONTACT_30967]. Subjects will answer questions 
regarding product use, clarity of the IFU, ease of use, etc.  Subjects will also receive an exam of their oral 
cavity. 
 
6. Study Design 
Study Type: Interventional (Clinical Trial) 
Enrollment: Phase I: 16 participants, 8 with xerostomia and 8 w ithout 
xerostomia 
Phase II: 16 participants with xerostomia (may include 
participants in Phase I with xerostomia)  
Allocation:N/A 
Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment 
Masking:None (Open Label) 
Primary Purpos e:Human Factor Validation - Usability Engineering assessment 
for OTC labeling 
Official Title:SaliPen Usability Engineering Study  for OTC labeli ng 
Study Start Date: TBD 
 
According to the FDA Guidance document “Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical 
Devices”, a sample of [ADDRESS_1096384] possibility of detecting user interface design flaws while limiting the amount of 
resources required. 
 
7. Arms and Interventions 
Arm  Intervention/treatment  
Experimental: Use of SaliPen medical device  Use according to self-decision.  
 
 SaliPen Human Factors Study for OTC 
labeling Page 8 of 18 
Revision 0.5 
 
 
 
 8. Features to be studied 
 
The points of interaction between the user and the device (User Interface) will be evaluated, including: 
- the elements of the device with which the user interacts (i.e., those parts of the device that users 
see and touch), and 
- the IFU (including packaging, labeling, User Manual, etc.). 
The following parameters will be studied: 
- Hazard: Potential source of harm, if any. 
- Use error: User action or lack of action that was different from that expected by [CONTACT_13989]. 
 
9. Outcome Measures 
1. Percentage of participants who appropriately will self-select the study product for use under 
simulated OTC conditions [Phase I]. Following the standard norms for the Rx-to-OTC 
switch process, this outcome is a validation of potential consumers' ability to self-diagnose the 
condition and to decide that treatment with the product is appropriate for them. 
2. Percentage of participants who correctly will use the study product when dispensed under 
simulated OTC conditions [Phase II]. Correct use means that the participants will demonstrate the 
use of the study product according to the guidelines outlined in the User Manual.  
Following the standard norms for the therapy of Rx-to-OTC switch process, this outcome is a 
validation of potential consumers' ability to self-treat with the product according to the product's 
supplied IFU.

11. Reportable Events 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the 
investigation.  Any findings will be documented on the AE CRF.   
 Serious AEs include any events resulting in death, decreased life expectancy, life-threatening situations, 
persistent or permanent disability/incapacity, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or congenital anomaly/birth defect or 
other important medical event. Within 24 hours, the Investigator will submit a written report 
documenting the circumstances of the serious AE. 
While AE’s and SAE’s are not anticipated, should an incident occur during the visit or a subject report an 
event following the visit, the AE will be recorded in the subject’s study records and followed to 
resolution. 
 
12. Contacts and Locations 
The subjects will randomly be recruited at clinical settings that deal with oral health, like dental or head 
and neck clinics. The outcome measure will be performed in this setting. Data will be collected on-site by 
[CONTACT_49885]. 
 
13. Task Analysis 
The Task Analysis breaks down the device use process into discrete sequences of tasks. The tasks will be 
analyzed to identify the user interface components involved, the use errors that users could make and 
the potential results of all use errors. The following task analysis is planned:

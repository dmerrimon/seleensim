BURDEN (A MARKER OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE RISK), AMONG 
COGNITIVELY NORMAL ELDERLY  
 
Short Title  The Sleep  Amyloid , Slow WAve Race and Ethnicity  (Sleep AWARE)  study  
Brief Summary  African -Americans (AAs) have an increased prevalence of both Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) and  vascular risk factors for AD such as diabetes and hypertension 
when  compared to whites . However, in a recent community based study of non -
demented elderly , black race  was associated with higher amyloid burden 
after adjusting for vascular risk factors, suggesting the presence of  additional 
physiological differences on AD -risk by [CONTACT_558028].  
The purpose of this study is to test whether poor s low wave sleep (SWS) 
quantity (SWS duration) and quality (slow wave activity, SWA) is one of these 
physiological factors. To test these hypotheses, we will perform community 
outreach in barbershops, churches and senior centers in Brooklyn  and other 
NYC bor oughs  with which we have created substantial ties in recent years. In 
consultation with community stakeholders, we will recruit 150 cognitively 
normal AA elderly (age 60-75) and [ADDRESS_732643] 
perform a medical and cognitive evaluation (Visit 1). Participants will then 
undergo [ADDRESS_732644] sleep 
duration. Both devices will be returned by [CONTACT_2319]. Subjects with reported  total 
sleep time (TST) between 5 and 10 hours and absence of  moderate to severe  
OSA will be invited to perform a 2 -night nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) 
(Nights 1 -2) and a PiB -PET MR scan (Visit 2) .   
Objectives  Objective 1:  To test if African ancestry (%AF) is associated with short SWS 
duration and poor SWA in older AAs.  
Objective  2: To test the effect of race and its interaction with baseline short 
SWS duration/poor SWA on longitudinal amyloid deposition.  
Objective 3:  To test the effect of race and baseline poor SWA on cognition.  
Secondary Objective 2.1:  To test whether loss of sl eep-dependent spatial 
navigational memory at baseline is a predictor of cognitive decline .  
 
Methodology  30-36 month longitudinal study  
Endpoint  Primary endpoint is longitudinal increase in amyloid deposition

native English speakers is due to the nature of the study  and cognition being 
one of the outcomes of the study . The  reason for including only African 
American blacks and NHW is the  focus of this grant  which  is on African 
Americans  and their African genetic ancestry  and admixture . Based on our 
preliminary data an existing literature, in order for genetic admixture analyses 
to be applied rigorously, the control group needs to be of NHW.  The definition 
of NHW  are people in the [LOCATION_002] who are considered racially white and 
are not of Hispanophone identity or the Hispanosphere (terms used to refer to 
Spanish -language speakers and the Spanish -speaking world  as compared to for 
example English -speaking of French -speaking to name a few ). Other non -
English non -Hispanic white ethnicities will not be invited to participate due to 
the lack of adequate neuropsyschological tools and testers proficient in other 
native European languages  and the confounding effects of immigration .  These  
NHW  participants will be located  within the same  zip codes  as the AAs .

morbidity and increased AD -risk68-70. AAs take longer to fall asleep18-23, have lower sleep efficiency and have 
consistently shown to spend a smaller proportion of time in deep stages of non -REM (NREM) (also called 
slow wave sleep [SWS])19;20;23 -28;32.  Possible mediators underlying these racial differences in sleep inclu de 
age, sex, obesity, psychosocial factors, health care behaviors and medical disorders21;23;27;71 -76. A meta -
analysis designed to estimate the magnitude of these variations in sleep, showed that racial/ethnic 
differences in sleep duration and continuity were moderated by [CONTACT_139739] s underlined above23, while only 
psychosocial stressors  (measured as perceived discrimination)20;21;26  were partially associated with the 
decreases in SWS du ration, suggesting that race still remained an important independent risk factor for 
decreased SWS among AAs. A recent study confirmed this finding showing that decreased SWS duration 
was associated with an increased percentage of African ancestry (%AF)[ADDRESS_732650] been linked 
with reductions in time spent in SWS79;80.  
 
Approximately 20% of healthy adults have mild and 6.6% moderate -to-severe obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA)81, with a higher incidence occurring in the elderly82. AAs  generally show a higher prevalence of OSA33-
36. Specifically, in the Cleveland Family Study, AAs presented with OSA at a younger age35, while Ancoli -
Israel et al.[ADDRESS_732651] , both the Sleep Heart Health (7% AAs) and Scharf’s et al. studies  failed to sho w higher rates of OSA 
in AAs after controlling for obesity83;84. However, AAs from these studies suffered more excessive daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], in agreement to previous findings suggesting that OSA -associated symptoms might be more 
common in AAs34;85. Apnea occurs less commonly during SWS, as SWS is associated with a higher 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_111283]86;[ADDRESS_732652] 
activity (SWA) has shown to be slower in mild OSA89, and severe OSA patients show  up to a 40% rebound 
in SWS duration during treatment with CPAP90. All the above findings suggest  that changes in SWS are 
common in OSA patients. SWS disruption may therefore be another mechanism by [CONTACT_558029]91-93.  
In summary:  certain ethnic groups are more likely to have disturbed sleep. AAs show clear 
independent differences in SWS characteristics but not in sleep duration or OSA preva lence when compared 
to whites, after controlling for socioeconomic factors, obesity or health care behaviors. These differences 
seem unrelated to other explanatory factors (expect for the partial effect of psychosocial stressors) and 
suggest that AAs may h ave less restorative sleep than whites.  The brain consequences of these decreases in 
SWS are not known.  
 
2.2 Rationale  
 
Primary Aims.  To examine:  i) whether African Ancestry (%AF) is associated with decreased SWS duration 
and SWA; ii) the effects of race on longitudinal amyloid build -up and its interaction with baseline SWS 
duration and SWA in cognitively normal elderly; iii) the effects of race and its interaction with baseline SWA 
on longitudinal changes in global cognition, memory,  executive function and a spatial navigational memory 
task.  Exploratory aim.  We will test whether loss of sleep -dependent spatial navigational memory at baseline 
is a predictor of cognitive decline at follow -up. 
 
Rationale for ethnicity/nativity and clinical groups selection:  
Multiethnic cohort studies provide better information about disease causation but they are expensive to 
design. We will focus on 150 African -American (AA) blacks since African or Caribbean -born are not equally 
admixed and inclusion of more ethnic groups would result in loss of power for Aim 1 and need for great 
increases in sample size . As a comparison group, we will include 60 matched  non-Hispanic  whites. Race 
will be represented both as binary (self -identified AA vs. self-identified  white) and numeric (% of African 
ancestry). Irregular sleep -wake rhythms and extreme sleep durations may also increase AD risk68-70. The 
study will not formally test these sleep disorders, as these subjects are hard to recruit in community -based

be allowed as long as  total sleep time (TST) is between 5 -9 hours based on actigraphy recordings and sleep 
logs performed at home.  
 
2.3 Potential  Risks & Benefits  
2.3.1  Known Potential Risks  
The following risks and discomforts may be experienced during participation in the study. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_557982], medical complications may occur. These include not only physical injury, but also possible 
psychological, social or economic harm, discomfort or inconvenience, or breach of confidentiality.  To 
minimize risks, all study personnel are highly trained and experienced; materials are kept in locked file 
cabinets and  are only available to investigators and research personnel associated with the study. All 
materials sent to outside laboratories are anonymized and the codes are kept with the NYU CBH Contact -
PI ([CONTACT_558071], MD). Both NYU’s CBH and the Center for Healthfu l Behavior Change (CHBC) , which will 
be a collaborator on this study to help provide  expertise in recruitment strategies, have excellent records of 
safekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_415755]’ data and have never had a breach of security. In the event of an adverse event at NYU 
or MSISC there are medical personnel available.  
 
1. Physical, Neurological and Psychiatric Exams:  
For the standard clinical examinations,  there are minimal to no risks associated with the testing. The 
main risk is a loss of privacy and every precaution is taken to ensure confidentiality. Other psychological 
risks include discovering a condition that was not previously known.  
 
2. Psychometric Testing:  
There are no risks associated with cognitive testing. Some individuals may experience fatigue or test 
perfor mance anxiety.  Periodic breaks will be available during cognitive testing.   
 
3. Laboratory Analysis of Blood:  
The potential risks of blood drawing may occasionally include pain, bruising, fainting, or a small 
infection at the puncture site. Sometimes a s mall amount of bleeding into the arm (hematoma) may occur.  
 
4. Heart Tracing (EKG):  
The back of the electrodes are adhesive and may be uncomfortable when they are removed.  There are 
no other risks associated with an EKG other than discovering a heart cond ition that was not previously 
known.  
 
5. Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  
There are potential dangers in obtaining DNA information. Genetic testing can generate information 
about a subject’s personal health risks and can cause or increase anxiety, damage family relationships, 
and/or compromise insurability, employability and lead to social discrimination. To greatly reduce the 
possibility of such psychological or social risks, genetic results will be coded and no personal identification 
will link the subject with the genotype. Genetic results will not be disclosed to participants.  We will include 
recommended language about the certificate of confidentiality and its limitations to the consent form.  
 
6. MRI Scan:  
 MRI scanning involves the use of powerful magnets delivering radio frequency energy. Therefore, 
patients who have implanted metal devices, such as pacemakers, certain aneurysm clips, or shrapnel or 
metal in the eye, skull or elsewhere in the body are at risk. There are no known risks or adverse effects 
resulting directly from exposure to magnetic fields and radio frequency energy used in this study. Contrast 
agents are not used in this study. Some people feel claustrophobic in the MR or PET -MR scanners. The MR 
scanner produces loud tappi[INVESTIGATOR_557983]. Other 
rare risks of MRI may include neuro -stimulation effects resulting in muscle twitches and tingling 
sensations, due to the rapid s witching of magnetic fields, and a slight increase in body temperature that 
may occur in  the presence and absorption of radio frequency energy. These are, however, very unlikely 
under current operational guidelines.  In the very remote event that the magnet loses its magnetism, liquid

accumulation of these gases.  
   
7. 11C-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_511092] -B (PiB) PET -MR scan:  
 There is the possibility of discomforts associated with venous catheters. These risks include: minor pain 
or soreness, lightheadedness an d/or minor bruising at the site of the catheter insertions, and less 
commonly, the formation of a small clot or swelling of the vein and bleeding. A chance of infection also 
exists. Experienced medical personnel will be involved in venipuncture procedure t o minimize the possible 
risks associated with the catheters.  As the effective dose (ED) of PiB is about 2. 93 mSv when the 
recommended activity of 412 MBq of PiB is administered, adverse reactions due to radiation are expected 
to occur with a very low pr obability. In addition, PET/MR eliminates the exposure to CT scans used for 
attenuation correction by [CONTACT_31526]/CT systems, so the radiation included would be lower than that of a 
similar study using PET/CT. Critical organ gallbladder wall exposure is 23.03 mGy.  PiB  is an experimental 
substance and other individual responses are possible and cannot be predicted.  The frequency of allergic 
reaction s to PiB is not known.   
 
8. Sleep Studies:  
The in -laboratory NPSG sleep studies are identical to those performed in clinical practice and present 
almost no risks as we will be using the standard diagnostic protocol for all subjects presenting to the MSISC 
with sleep complaints meriting a s leep study. The sleep study has no risks beyond the minor irritation that 
attachment of the recording electrodes on the skin occasionally may cause.  
 
D.  ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS:  
 
1. Recruitment, Informed Consent and Incidental Findings:  
This study will involve male and female African -American elderly and white volunteer subjects with a 
diagnosis of ‘cognitively normal’ (CDR=0).  Informed consent is obtained from each subject using IRB 
approved consent forms. In the consent form and in dis cussion with an investigator, participants will be 
advised fully of the procedures to be used, the amount of time required of them, the possible risks and 
benefits of the procedures, their right to refuse participation in the study without prejudice, their  right to 
terminate participation at any moment without prejudice, and the name [CONTACT_558069] (Drs. Osorio and Jean -Louis). In the informed consent form (ICF), participants will 
be told that the information they provid e and all findings will be kept strictly confidential, with access 
limited to the research staff and the possible exception of state or federal regulatory personnel. Several steps 
will be taken to minimize reactions of discomfort, embarrassment, fatigue, o r boredom.  
 
Interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_558030]. The 
informed consent procedure explains the overall purpose of the study in straightforward terms, and 
explains the conditions of confidential ity. We encourage participants’ questions and comments throughout 
the interview. For our questions about educational and cultural background, we emphasize that there is ‘no 
right answer’ to the questions. All participants are informed that they may refuse to answer any question 
and that they may discontinue the interview at any time without affecting their participation in the study 
or medical treatment. Participants are explicitly asked for their feedback, reactions, and strategies. 
Research staff that con duct follow -up interviews are blind to prior research diagnosis. All personnel of the 
study will have successfully completed the required education on protection of human research participants 
performed at NYU Langone Medical Center (NYULMC). In the ICF an d in the discussion with members of 
the research team, participants will be advised that if the standard medical, neurological, or 
neuropsychological evaluation should uncover significant deficit or an emergent and previously 
undiagnosed medical condition,  or if the blood assays reveal significantly abnormal findings, [CONTACT_275143] will 
contact [CONTACT_558031], if permitted, contact [CONTACT_2299]’s physician or refer 
the  participant to an appropriate medical professional for fol low-up. A technician reviews each MRI scan 
as they are being acquired for major abnormalities. A licensed, board -certified radiologist will perform a 
safety review  on every MRI scan and results will be communicated to study participants within 4 weeks of 
the date they are obtained. Findings of clinical significance, such as a mass, acute hemorrhage/infarct will 
trigger telephone notification of the subject by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tracy Butler, MD and will inform them that  an abnormal 
result has been found, and instructing t hem to contact [CONTACT_110319] (PCP). In addition, with

In the absence of clinically significant findings, the report of the neurora diology review will be 
communicated to the participant in the form of a letter that describes the general findings; a more detailed 
radiological report is transmitted to the participant’s PCP upon explicit request and retained in a permanent 
data base, but  no direct telephone contact [CONTACT_97632]. If the subject has no physician, and has a clinically 
significant finding, we will arrange for follow -up care at a local clinic.  
 
2. Protection Against Risk:  
 
a. PiB PET scans   
 
PET -MR scanning involves the use of powerful magnets. Therefore, patients who have implanted metal 
devices, such as pacemakers, certain aneurysm clips, or shrapnel or metal in the eye, skull or elsewhere in 
the body are at risk. There are no known risks or adv erse effects resulting directly from exposure to magnetic 
fields and radio frequency energy used in this study. Contrast agents are not used in this study. Some people 
feel claustrophobic in the PET -MR scanners. The MR scanner produces loud tappi[INVESTIGATOR_557984]. Other rare risks of MRI may include neuro -stimulation 
effects resulting in muscle twitches and tingling sensations, due to the rapid switching of magnetic fields, 
and a slight increase in body temperature . These are, however, very unlikely under current operational 
guidelines.  In the very remote event that the magnet loses its magnetism, liquid helium in the magnet will 
be released. The room is designed with ventilation systems to prevent accumula tion of these gases.  
 
Amyloid Pi[INVESTIGATOR_511092] B (PiB) tracer:  
There is no recommended dose for PiB. [ADDRESS_732654] dose that has 
been recommended in the human studies published thus far (Klunk WE, Ann 
Neurol. 2004 Mar;55(3):306 -19; Scheinin NM J Nucl Med. 2007 Jan;48(1):128 -
33), but most studies published to date include doses from 370 to 555 MBq (for a 
Cochrane review see Zhang S, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2014, 
Issue 7), with [ADDRESS_732655]  injected dose below which the scan 
‘should not be performed and be rescheduled’ according to the PET Technical 
procedures ADNI methods published in May 10th 2007 Version 1.2 
(http://www.adniinfo.org/Scientists/doc/PET_PIB_Tech_Procedures_Manual_Suppl_v1.3.pdf ) Given the:  
i) heterogeneity in injected doses; ii) the heterogeneity in the current conduct and interpretation of the 
tests; iii) the lack of define d thresholds for determination of test positivity; iv) the plan of sharing the scans 
from this study with both the ADNI LONI Image Data Archive (IDA) and NACC Imaging;  and; v) in the low 
signal to noise ratio (S NR) with [ADDRESS_732656] the confidentiality of the 
subjects. All sleep analyses and in -labs will be performed within the MSISC ([ADDRESS_732657]). MSISC  
has explicit emergency and procedu re guidelines in place for dealing with medical emergencies that may 
arise.

This material is the property of the NYU School of Medicine and Langone Medical Center.  Do not disclose or use except as 
authorized in writing by [CONTACT_558027]: 5 MAY 2017  2.3.2  Known Potential Benefits  
Participants are made aware that the study does not provide clinical treatment and should not be used 
as a substitute for proper medical care with a physician; however, if the standard medical, neurological, or 
neuropsychological evaluation reveals significant deficit or an emergent and previously undiagnosed 
medical condition, or if the blood assays, or MRI scan reveal significant abnormalities, this information will 
be discussed with the participant and transmitted to their PCP . We do not expect the majority of 
participants to benefit directly from the research other than by [CONTACT_558032]. The potential benefits to s ociety are considerable if this study reveals new information about new 
biological mechanism of AD risk in African -American elderly. Therefore, the risks to participants are 
reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to society.  
 
[ADDRESS_732658] if African  ancestry (%AF)  is associated  with short SWS duration and poor 
SWA in o lder  AAs . Challenge:  AAs consistently spend less time in SWS than whites23-32. Although SWS 
shows significant heritability, social stressors may moderate these differences . Approach:  test whether 
%AF40  is assoc iated with SWS characteristics after controlling for psychosocial factors ( e.g. stress related 
to ethnicity). Outcome:  positive results would suggest that racial differences in SWS have genetic  
underpi[INVESTIGATOR_11423].  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_732659] of race and its interaction with baseline short SWS duration/poor 
SWA on longitudinal amyloid deposition . Challenge:  AAs spend less time  in SWS23-32, a sleep stage 
important for Aβ dynamics41-[ADDRESS_732660] amyloid deposition44. Approach : assess 
how race is associated with longitudinal PiB uptake and its interaction with short SWS duration and poor 
SWA, after controlling for: 1) medial prefrontal (mPFC) atrophy, TST, AHI4% and  cerebrovascular damage 
(measured as white ma tter lesion [WML] volume and abnormal diffusion kurtosis imaging [DKI] indices); 
and, 2) psychosocial factors, health care behaviors and medical morbidity.  Outcome:  reduced SWS/SWA 
would become a novel risk factor for AD in African Americans (AAs).  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_732661] of race and baseline poor SWA on cognition . Challenge:   race and poor 
sleep have been associated with cognitive impairment. However, most studies are confounded by [CONTACT_558033], subjective measurements of sleep, lack o f valid cognitive assessments for AAs 
and inadequate enrollment of minorities . Approach : we will test for the association between race and 
longitudinal changes in global cognition , memory, executive function and a sleep -dependent spatial 
navigational memor y task. In addition, we will test their interaction with baseline SWA , using a similar 
approach as in Aim 2. Outcome:  positive results  would emphasize the importance of health messages 
promoting good sleep hygiene among AA elderly .  
3.2 Secondary Objectives (i f applicable)  
 
Secondary Objective : Exploratory : we will test whether loss of sleep -dependent spatial navigational 
memory at baseline is a predictor of cognitive decline at follow -up. A linked objective  is to identify how 
the relationship between SWS/SWA and the rate of change in PiB uptake might be confounded by [CONTACT_558034] (for measures of SWS) and DWML volumes and DKI  (for measures of PiB uptake).

adjusted for race and education,  English speakers, and with enough literacy to provide voluntary consent 
will be invited to participate.  
 
Exclusion criteria  at enrollment will be: intention to move from NYC within the same year , irregular sleep -
wake cycles defined as ‘≥3 sleep epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 24 -hr period’ or ‘day to day irregularity greater than [ADDRESS_732662]; OSA (defined as AHI4%>15 and AHI4%>5 
with Epworth≥10); neurodegenerative disorders, history of early onset familial AD; insu lin dependent 
diabetes; bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, intellectual disability or substance abuse; non -controlled 
pulmonary or cardiac diseases; brain tumors; stroke; head trauma and hydrocephalus.  
 
Lifelong depression and anxiety will be allowed as lon g as there has been no active depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_557985]. Current use of any sedative/hypnotics or stimulants, gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic 
antidepressants, and trazodone or other psychoactive medications that may alter SWS. Stable ( 3 months or 
longer) use of antidepressants will be allowed. Caribbean or African -born blacks or subjects that don’t fulfill 
inclusion criteria but express interest will be offered participation in similar NYU NIH -funded studies on 
sleep or normal aging.  
 
Study Enrollment:  
Self-identified AA and whites will be balanced by [CONTACT_4321], age, BMI, income and education, and will live in 
the same NYC  zip codes. Brooklyn will be the area of recruitment as it is the most ethnically diverse and 
largest most concen trated black population in the US -more than 900,000 blacks living in a 4 -mile square 
area -. The sample will include self -identified African -American (AA) blacks and non -Hispanic whites. As 
described in our published methods158;[ADDRESS_732663] ([CONTACT_558072]) and a Community Advisory Board (CAB) that has been created for this 
cohort. It will include community stakeholders with whom we have long -standing relationships and consist 
of: black community leaders serving as Directors  of Community -based organizations (CBOs) and  members 
of the Brooklyn chapter of CaringKind . The CAB will comprise [ADDRESS_732664] been available previously. Our success in  assessing sleep in AAs is attributable to our sustained 
engagement efforts at the community level and help from former CABs.   
Participating recruitment sites will be selected based on visibility, accessibility, safety, longevity and 
cooperativeness204. Preference will be accorded to those providing private room for interactions with 
subjects. Recruitment procedures will be discussed with site owners  before scheduled visits. Respective 
owners will introduce the recruitment team, who will then approach potential participants (while waiting 
at the salon, after church services or senior center activities) to describe the protocol.  The recruitment team 
will be made up of research coordinators and other members of the study staff.  As in our previous 
interventions158, staff will begin by [CONTACT_558035].   
 
If int erested, eligibility will be confirmed and consent obtained. They will then complete the Center for 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6326] (CES -D)205 Scale,  the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (MOSSF)206, 
the ARES -TM questionnaire149, a medication list and the AD8207 (these forms will be used for initial 
screening; interested subjects not eligible or with high risk for OSA will be offered participation in similar 
NYU NIH -funded studies). Those refusing to enroll will receive standard sleep literature and access to the 
NYU ADC Center or Brooklyn’s NYU affiliated Lutheran Medical Center. No further contact [CONTACT_97632]. 
During the first 9 months, themes derived from focus groups ( R01MD004113 ) and through meetings 
between the PIs, [CONTACT_457690] and the CAB will be used to develop sleep and memory health booklets using 
Taylor’s model208. These booklets will be left on the participating centers for recruitment outside the 
scheduled visits.  All recruitment materials will be submitted to the IRB through a modification for approval

Diagnostic Criteria:  
 
1. The diagnoses  of MCI, and AD .  All subjects get extensive baseline and follow -up evaluations to 
identify co -morbidity and any confounding medical, neurological, and psychiatric  conditions that can affect 
cognition. For all subjects, the study neurologist or psychiatris t administers  a standardized interview of a 
knowledgeable informant. The diagnosis is assigned at consensus case  conferences using established and 
reliable procedures . The following diagnoses might be given at follow -up:

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the NYU School of Medicine and Langone Medical Center.  Do not disclose or use except as 
authorized in writing by [CONTACT_558027]: 5 MAY 2017  b. The definition of MCI:  subjects  demonstrating functional complaints (self -reported and  supported by 
a knowledgeable informant) and who on clinical interviews show no dementia but with a CDR=0.5, GDS 
=3, and MOCA <25  are classified as MCI. Amnestic (a) aMCI is defined on the basis of upd ated. Petersen 
criteria with delayed recall performance below 1.[ADDRESS_732666] from 
a domain other than delayed recall, falling below z=1.5 SD from the norms (see below). Subjects  judged to 
be cognitively impaired by [CONTACT_15370], but with a presentation, tests, symptoms and clinical  evaluation 
that is not consistent with MCI will be classified as ‘Impaired, not MCI’.  
 
c. The diagnosis of AD : at the follow -up is consistent with the NINCDS -ADRDA workgroup  
recommendations and DSM IV criteria. The definition of AD re quires that after ruling out other dementia 
etiologies that the individual demonstrate on structured clinical interviews, progressive impairments in two 
or more areas of cognition and difficulties in activities of daily living. Thus AD is rated as CDR >0.5 . The 
memory impairment criterion is satisfied by [CONTACT_558036]. Functional impairment is estimated by [CONTACT_558037], the clin ical history evaluation, and the informant interview.  
 
4.3 Vulnerable Subjects  
 
 
We are not including children  or women  who are pregnant because  this study is designed for adult s and 
elderly subjects.  
4.4 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
Expected Participant Flow:   
Yearly complete evaluations (including baseline and follow -up) will range from 80 -84 (Table 2). Initial 
screening will be performed through the CES -D, MOSSF, ARES -TM, medication list and AD8. The number 
of total subjects enrolled will be  of 270  to meet the goal of 210 eligible subjects . We anticipate that 17% will 
be referred to seek treatment due to OSA, while 3 -5% will not complete the study evaluations or fulfill 
inclusion criteria due to cognitive impairment. Based on an average of [ADDRESS_732667] (6 h for visits 1 -2, 18 h for night 1 -2) we will be able to complete 2 subjects per week.  To maximize 
cohort retention we will adopt strategies developed for our own studies209-211 and more than 20 years of 
experience working with underrepresented groups at the NYU ADC. These will include:  i) a multicultural 
staff; ii) providing flexible visit options;  iii) using monetary incentives after compl etion of all study visits 
(each subject will receive $500  after a completed milestone and payment is not contingent upon completing 
all visits ); iv) making reminder phone calls prior to scheduled visits; v) providing a clinical report to share 
with their primary care physician; vi) sending Annual  Holiday letters ; vii) performing telephone follow -ups 
after completion of the baseline visit; and, viii) participating in local memory walks in Brooklyn together wi th 
the Alzheimer’s Association,  and co -sponsoring together with the NYU ADC three annual scientific updates 
at NYU’s Langone Medical Center in both English and Spanish. Previous annual attrition rates at the ADC 
have been 4% for healthy controls, 13% for M CI and 20% for AD patients.  We anticipate that the efforts 
described above will lead to even higher retention rates (expected 95% at the 2.5 year follow -up)  
 
4.5 Duration of Study Participation  
The study will be over the course of 30 months per participant, although we will provide flexible visit 
options and up to 35 months will be allowed.  
4.6 Total Number of Participants and Sites  
 
Up to 270 people will be enrolled to reach a goal of 210 evaluabl e participants (accounting 
for attrition).

authorized in writing by [CONTACT_558027]: [ADDRESS_732668].  An 
investigator may terminate participation  in the study if:  
 Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
participant.  
 The participant meets an exclusio n criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation during the [ADDRESS_732669]’s participation regardless of whether the subject wishes to continue participating.  Data 
collected on the subject to the point of withdra wal will remain part of the study database and will not be 
removed . The consent document will give the subject the option of having his/her data anonymized. In all 
cases we will ask subjects who are withdrawing whether they wish to provide continued clinic al follow -up 
subsequent to their withdrawal ( i.e. yearly  clinical interview by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Butler and neuropsychological 
evaluations that are part of the UDS -3). Under this circumstance, the discussion with the subject will 
distinguish between study -related evalua tions and continued follow -up of associated clinical outcome 
information, such as medical course obtained through a clinical interview and neuropsychological tests. A 
second option will be to continue participation through the ADC cohort. In all cases we w ill address the 
maintenance of privacy and confidentiality of the subject's information.  
 
If a subject : i) withdraws from the study, ii) does not consent to continued follow -up of associated clinical 
outcome information, and iii) does not request removal of their data, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_557987]’s medical record or other confidential records requiring the subject’s 
consent. However, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_557988]’s 
withdrawal from the study, and may consult public records, such as those establishing survival status. A 
subject will be considered lost to follow -up after non -response to: [ADDRESS_732670], 5 phone calls to the study partner, 3 emails and 1 certified letter to the participant 
home address.  Replacement will be allowed in those subjects that withdraw from the study in less than 12 
months after the baseline visit . 
 
4.7.3  Premature Termination or Suspension of Study  
 
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. 
Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_558038], funding agency, and regulatory authorities. If the study 
is prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33894](s) 
for the termination or suspension.  
Circumstanc es that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
 
 Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
 Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
 Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or e valuable  
 
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, data quality are addressed and 
satisfy the sponsor and/or IRB.

(Pregnancy urine test will be done on women prior to the exam)  
o PET/MR scans combine two types of imaging methods: Posit ron Emissions Tomography 
(PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).   PET uses radioactive tracers to produce 
images that can inform us how a particular compound is used by [CONTACT_558039] -types, such as Tau, in this study.   MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to 
produce images that can inform us about structures and function of tissue in the body. 
Combining both techniques provides more useful information while reducing the amount 
of radiation exposure compared to a standard PET scan or PET/CT. A small amount of 
tracer known as 11C-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_511092] -B (PiB)  will be injected into a vein in your arm 
before the scan begins and a 60-min PET -MR scan will be performed 35 min after injection.

6 Study Procedures/Evaluations  
6.1 Procedures/Evaluations  
Clinical evaluation:   all subjects will perform a standardized clinical evaluatio n (UDS 3.0) given to all 
participants seen at the NYU ADC. The purpose of this clinical evaluation is to establish that subjects are 
cognitively normal, identify concurrent medications that may act as confounders ( e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
trazodone, suvorexa nt), increase reproducibility of the clinical evaluation, and facilitate collaborative 
research with NACC (see Resource Sharing Plan ). Depressive symptoms will be measured using the 
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)212;213 . We will add information about: health insurance, annual household 
income, perceived discrimination (Index of Race -Related Stress [IRRS] -Brief Version B214), the Weinstein 
Noise Sensitivity Scale (WNSS)215, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)216 and the SF36 health behaviors 
survey217 to control for environmental, health and psychosocial factors that might disrupt sleep. In addition, 
all subjects will undergo complete fasting blood tests ( CBC with  differential  and platelet  count,  highly 
sensitive CRP, ESR,  total  T3 and T4*,  lipid  profile,  RPR*,  comprehensive  metabolic  profile  with  insulin,  
folate*,  homocysteine*,  and vitamin  B12*,  SMA -18, HbA1c, hemogram )).  Subjects will then complete the 
WHICAP battery and the AMNART test4. The tests comprising this neuropsychological battery were chosen 
because unlike the UDS 3.0, they have race -specific norms5. We will construct three composite scores for 
general cognition, memory, and executive function from factor analyses. We will use total r ecall, delayed 
recall, and delayed recognition from the Buschke Selective Reminding Test218 to construct the memory 
composite . The executive functioning  composite will be created using the Color Trail -Making Test (A and 
B)219, WAIS -R (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -Revised), Similarities, Identities/Oddities subtest of the 
Mattis Dementia Rating Scale220, two cancellation tasks and semantic fluency for animals221. All of the above 
varia bles, together with phonemic fluency221, the 15 -item [LOCATION_011] Naming Test222,  repetition task (high -
frequency phrases of the [LOCATION_011] Diagnostic Aphasia Examination[BDAE]223; and a comprehension task, 
will contribute to the composite for general cognition . Means an d standard deviations (SD) will be 
calculated from baseline scores for non -demented WHICAP subjects controlling for age, race and years of 
education using robust norms. Z -scores for each of the cognitive measures will be averaged to create a 
composite z -score for each of the three domains. Only subjects diagnosed as cognitively normal with a z -
score > -1.[ADDRESS_732681] battery will range from 45 -90 min.  On visit 2 , prior to the PET/MR scan, subjects will 
complete the UDS 3.0 cognitive evaluation to facilitate collaborative research with NACC.   
 
Ambulatory home monitoring for OSA followed by [CONTACT_55629]:  
Subjects will be asked to monitor their sleep using sleep logs during one week. On the first night , OSA 
will be monitored using a WatchPAT ( Itamar Medical, Tel Aviv, Israel ) (Figure 8) . We have experience 
using WatchPAT in AAs with very low failure rate (l ess than 1%). This self -applied device measures 
peripheral arterial volume changes using a finger -mounted plethysmograph. The information is collated

arousals with measurement of O 2Sat to determine respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266] -related arousals 
showing excellent sensitivity and specificity for identification of OSA, defined as 
AHI4%≥[ADDRESS_732682]. Ayappa.  Only subjects with an AHI4%<15 and AHI4%>5 with 
Epworth<[ADDRESS_732683]. Actigraphs ( AMI, Ardsley, NY ) (Figure 9) with off -wrist 
detection and a sleep diary will be provided to the subjects to use for the [ADDRESS_732684] the sleep -wake cycle and provide 
estimates of total sleep ti me (TST) in the home. Actigraph  will also provide bedtimes 
and wake times for NPSG N1 -N2 in accordance with their usual sleep habits.  
 
Measurement of Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) characteristics using NPSG:   
Each in -lab NPSG will record sleep as recommended by [CONTACT_140671]225 as described  in 
our previous work156. Electrode attachment will be performed between 8 -9 PM. Subjects 
will be then asked to sit quietly and/or read until lights out at their habitual bedtime. 
NPSG N1 will be for habituation, N2 will be for data collection. Arousal index (AI), sleep 
staging, TST, sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset (WASO) during NPSG will be 
scored by [CONTACT_558040]225. Participants will 
go home between N1 -[ADDRESS_732685] detection, avoid naps or exercise 
and track their meals. SWS will be scored visually as: 1) TST in SWS in min. (SWS duration); and, 2) %TST 
spent in SWS (%SWS). S WS measurements will be measured in N2.  In addition, we will include: 1) slow 
wave activity (SWA) : absolute SWA (defined as power between 0.5 -4.0 Hz during NREM), relative SWA 
(SWA divided by [CONTACT_558041] 0.4 -50 Hz). NREM cycles will be defined as sta ges NREM2 -3 of ≥15 min. 
terminated by [CONTACT_558042] ≥5 min.  Delta power will be averaged relative to the number of 
epochs.  2)  SWS continuity:  bouts of SWS will be defined as the duration of consecutive 30 sec. epochs of 
sleep scored as SWS, term inated by [CONTACT_558043]226;227.   
 
Sleep -dependent Neuropsychologica l Tests:  
On NPSG N2, participants will be trained in our published 3-D virtual maze spatial navigational test (see 
Figure 10)141;[ADDRESS_732686] ripple suppression impairs 
performance on a radial arm maze,230 while REM suppression impairs memory in the radial arm maze231 
and in the Morris water maze232. In humans, o vernight sleep enhances virtual 
maze navigation performance233;[ADDRESS_732687] shown that maze 
completion time (CT) is attenuated after REM disruption176 and is correlated 
with SWA in elderly subjects188. Subjects will experience two different mazes 
at baseline and at the 2.[ADDRESS_732688] knowledge of the 
maze layout.  Maze performance will be expressed as % c hange across sleep in 
maze CT compared to baseline CT before sleep. We have chosen a maze over a 
word -pair test105;235;236  because: 1) it taxes the hippocampus (more than a 
word -pair ta sks would); 2) it’s ecologically relevant to AD ( i.e. spatial 
disorientation is one of the early clinical AD -symptoms); and 3) there are equivalent rodent models that 
lend insight into the underlying electrophysiological mechanisms ( i.e. sharp -wave ripples, which cannot be 
captured with surface EEG).   
 
PiB PET and MRI scans:  
On visit 4, baselin e and follow -up subjects will receive a single dose of 11.12  mCi PiB and perform a 
dynamic 60 min amyloid PiB PET -MR scan 35 min after injection. . The radioactive drug (PiB) shall meet 
appropriate chemical, pharmaceutical, and radionuclidic standards. The dose will be radioassayed proper 
to administration to ensure dosimetry data is correct. Furth er, the mass of the PiB is not expected to 
produce a pharmacologic response. PET/MR scans will be performed on an integrated 3T PET/MR

authorized in writing by [CONTACT_558027]: 5 MAY 2017  (Siemens  Biograph mMR, software Syngo MR B18P ). For anatomic coregistration, a sagittal 3 -D MPRAGE  
sequence will be perfo rmed (208 slices, 1mm isotropic voxels). Attenuation correction will be performed 
using a Dixon μ -map with a superimposed bone compartment and linear AC developed at NYU237. 
Modifying the linear A C value and superimposing a model -based bone compartment reduces the whole -
brain SUV estimation bias of Dixon -based PET/MR AC by 95% compared with reference PET/CT AC 
(p<.05), resulting in a residual −0.3% SUV mean bias237. Ultrashort echo time (UTE) will also be acquired 
and combined to the Dixon μ -map to incorporate the bone tissue238.  Simultaneous  PET -MR acquisition 
eliminates the need of registering the PiB images to MNI. Instead, we will use the MPRAGE for registration, 
which offers a fine volumetric resolution and high contrast ratio required to precisely differentiate between 
GM and WM. For eac h patient, the MPRAGE image will be automatically segmented into, neocortical and 
cerebellar hemisphere GM regions of interest (ROIs) using FreeSurfer. These GM neocortical ROIs will be 
collapsed to yield four large volume -weighted ROIs that span prefronta l, lateral temporal, parietal cortex 
and anterior/posterior cingulate gyrus cortices (as described in239). An AD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_557989], derived by [CONTACT_558044] a reference region 
containing the supratentorial WM and whole cerebellum.  PiB+ will be defined as a AD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_557990] ≥1.4.  The 
combined region will be used to calculate longitudinal estimates of change in PiB uptake.   
Images for exclusion and structural brain measurements of middle prefrontal cortex (mPFC).  Along with 
the PET acquisition we will acquire several sets of images intended to screen for brain disease, stroke or 
extensive white matter lesions. We will we use a thin slice 3D sagittal T1 MPRAGE sequence. Parameters 
are: TR 2100 ms; TE 4.37 ms; TI 90 0 ms; flip angle 8°; matrix 240 (read) x 256 (phase) x 208 (partitions); 
FOV 256 (read) x 192 (phase) x 240 (partitions) mm; iPAT 2; voxel size 1.0x1.0x1.0 mm; NEX 1; acquisition 
time 4.35’. Whole brain and cortical volumes:  automatic brain segmentation, c ortical surface reconstruction 
and parcellation will be performed using FreeSurfer (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu ). Segmentations will 
undergo qualitative reviews and volumes will be residualized to intracranial volume (ICV)169.  
Fluid -attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR):  We will obtain complete brain coverage using 3D sagittal 
FLAIR SPACE sequences to quantify white matter lesions (WML).  Parameters are: TR 6000 ms; TE 325 
ms; TI 2100 ms; matrix 256 (read) x 248 (phase) x 176 (partitions); FOV 256 (read) x 248 (phase) x 17 6 
(partitions) mm; iPAT 2; voxel size 1.0x1.0x1.0 mm; NEX 1; acquisition time 2.56’.  WML volume (mL) is 
considered a surrogate marker of small vessel disease.240 It will be obtained using an semi -automatic 
approach based on  hyperintense (≥mean+2.5SD) voxels in WM  with our locally developed software 
FireVoxel241;242  (files.nyu.edu/hr18/public ). WML volume will be subdivided into periventricular (PWML) 
and deep (DWML) . 
Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) is an extensi on of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)[ADDRESS_732690] integrity (WMTI) metrics245;246  that are specific to underlying pathology: (a) axonal water fraction 
(marker of axonal density); (b) Daxon, diffusivity inside the axons ( marker of axonal injury); and (c) De|| 
and De┴, extra -axonal axial and radial diffusivity ( markers of  extracellular inflammation, gliosis and 
demyelination). We will use an optimized protocol in terms of number of shells (b -values) and encoding 
directions, providing the best coverage of q -space for diffusion and kurtosis tensors estimation within a 
short acquisition time (~7 min). The protocol can be summarized  as follows: TR 8200 ms; TE 96 ms; b=0 
(4 averages), b=250 (6 directions), b=1000 (20 directions), b=2000 (30 directions), s/mm2, b=0 with 
reversed phase encoding direction (1 average); 50 axial slices; FOV 230 (read) x 230 (phase) mm2; voxel 
size 2.5x2.5x 2.5 mm3.  The DKI data will be used to derive parametric maps of DTI and DKI, followed by 
[CONTACT_558045] -house developed processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189] (github.com/NYU -Diffusion 
MRI/Diffusion -Kurtosis -Imaging).  Next, all maps will be transforme d into standard space using FMRIB’s 
Software Library.  Mean values will then be extracted for each metric to assess the microstructural WM 
damage beyond lesions visible on FLAIR.   
  
Individual Genetic Ancestry Estimation  
Allele frequencies will be ascertained from Utah residents with Northern and Western European 
ancestry and West African (Yoruban from Nigeria) samples available in the HapMap database. Individual 
% African ancestry (%AF) estimates from 0 -100 will be computed using a maximum likeliho od method for 
inferring individual admixture247. Briefly, an algorithm is used to compute the probability of observing a 
marker genotype given ancestral allele frequencies at a locus. Summing over the logs of individual locus 
probabilities combines information across multiple loci. The admixture proportion that maximizes the

 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
Unanticipated  Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or  consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_558047])  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops  or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_15369] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal  
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in 
in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events t hat do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious 
adverse events .  
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse ev ent if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of th e study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an 
adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.

imm ediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
recorded in the source document, though should be group ed under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment 
or participation  is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study 
period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after 
the study period and is considered to be possibly related to s tudy participation should be recorded and 
reported immediately.  
7.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems

8 Study Oversight  
 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_558071]) to oversee the safety of the study  
alongside with the Co -Investigator ([CONTACT_52409] -Louis) .  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment 
and appropriate reporting of AEs as noted above, as we ll as the construction and implementation of a site 
data and safety -monitoring plan . Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and 
type of serious adverse events.  
 
The PIs will work to develop all aspects of the proposed study incl uding direct oversight, staff supervision, 
engagement of the Community Advisory Board (CAB), supervision of staff, enrollment and monitoring of 
eligible participants, acquisition and management of subjective and clinical data, analysis and 
dissemination of  study results. They will also ensure that stated aims are achieved in a timely manner.

authorized in writing by [CONTACT_558027]: 5 MAY 2017  9 Statistical Considerations  
9.1 Study Hypotheses  
1. Hyp othesis 1.1 : poor SWS characteristics ( short SWS duration, low %SWS, low relative SWA, low SWS 
continuity and high AI) at baseline will be associated with high %AF. Hypothesis 1.2: psychosocial 
factors ( e.g. perceived  discrimination) will partially moderate the above relationships.  
2. Hypothesis 2.1 :  race will be associated with longitudinal increases in the annual rate of AD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_557995]. Hypothesis 2.2:  the effect of race in terms of longitudinal increases in AD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_557996] k will be 
partially explained by [CONTACT_558048].  
3. Hypothesis 3.1 : race will be associated with longitudinal changes in global cognition, memory, executive 
function and sleep -dependent spatial navigational memory. Hypothesis 3.2:  the associat ion of race in 
terms of cognitive decline will be partially explained by [CONTACT_558048].  Exploratory 
Hypothesis : absence of improvement in sleep dependent memory consolidation at baseline will be 
associated with longitudinal decreases in glo bal cognition, memory and executive function.  
 
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
Power was assessed under the assumption that dropout replacement will allow complete data to be 
acquired from 200 subjects. Based on the existing literature23-32, the coefficient of variation (CV) of SWS 
duration is anticipated to be as high as 90% among AA and 40% among whites. Baseline data from 150 AA 
and 60 whites will therefore provide 80% power at the 5% significance level to detect a mean SWS duration 
among whites that is at least 28% higher than among AA.  Based on PD4 , the CV of PiB uptake at baseline 
is anticipated to be as high as 35% among AA and 25% among whites, providing 80(90)% power at the  5% 
significance level to detect a mean PiB uptake among AAs that is at least 13%(15%) higher than in whites. 
For Aim 1, the study will have 80% power at the 5% significance level to detect correlations of magnitude 
|r|=0.20   (the study from Halder et al39 showed an R2 of 11, implying an even greater correlation of 0.33 
can be expected in our study). The multivariable regressi on analysis will have 80% power to detect SWS 
characteristics that can explain 3% of the variance in the longitudinal change in AD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_557990] (Aim 2) or 
cognition (Aim 3) after adjusting for covariates that together explain at least 25% of the variance in 
AD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_557990]/cognition. The detectable effect of 3% variance explained, implies the study can detect partial 
correlations of magnitude 0.1 between SWS and the outcomes adjusted for the cofactors. It is noted that the 
power of the multivariable analyses will impro ve if the covariates explain >25% of the variance. The study 
will have 80% power to detect sleep measures that explain 10% of the variance in the AD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_557997] a negligible percentage of the variance.   
 
9.3 Statistical Methods  
 
General considerations:  we will incorporate standard techniques such as omnibus tests and appropriate 
adjustments to significance (α) levels ( e.g., Bonferroni correction) for post -hoc contrasts to control for 
multiple comparisons. Both selection and attrition biases might occur. Appropriate techniques ( e.g., 
Heckman 2 -stage approach (GEE Probit Model)254;255  and Monte Carlo (EM algorithm)256 will be used to 
address biases or missing data. Attributes of those who withdrew to follow -up will be contrasted with 
completers to determine sources of attrition biases. Since only two time points will be analyzed, we will use 
linear regression models with the annual rate of amyloid change as dependent variable. Significance will be 
defined by p<.[ADDRESS_732698] -hoc contrasts.  
 Hypothesis (1):  H1.1)  for %AF associations, linear regression models, with each of SWS characteristics 
as the dependent variable,  will be regressed  on %AF controlling for age, sex, BMI, AHI, TST, sleep 
efficiency and WASO. H1.2)  This model will test interaction by [CONTACT_558049], the psychosocial factor as a classification factor, %AF and the term created as the 
cross product of psychosocial factors and %AF.  
 Hypothesis 2 -3 (H2 -3): First  we will calculate the associations between race and AD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_557998] d both as binary (AA vs. white) and numeric (%AF). Further analyses will use the 
representation (s) of race significantly associated with amyloid burden. Second , we will use hierarchical

adjusting for the matching factors: age, sex, BMI, education and annual income (block 1); ApoE4 and 
ABCA7 (block 2); DWML volumes, DKI indices and mPFC volume (block 3); and SWS characteristic ( e.g. 
relative SWA) (block 4) . Other covariates ( e.g.,  psychosocial) will be included in the final models if 
significantly different between AAs and whites as indicated by [CONTACT_558050] t tests. Although we  
anticipate that relative SWA will be the best predictor of longitudinal cha nge in AD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_557990], t he best fitting 
model will be then replicated with each of the other SWS characteristics not listed before.  On a final step,  
we will test whether the effect of SWS on amyloid deposition is different ( i.e., stronger) among AAs. The 
model would include AD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_558000], the binary indicator of race (AA=1 vs. white=0) and SWA as 
described in H1.2. If the interaction is significant, it will imply that the effect of SWA on amyloid varies as 
a function of race. The sign of the estimated coefficient for this term would indicate whether SWA has a 
significantly stronger or weaker effect among AA. Exploratory Hypothesis : cognitive z -score change in 
subjects that show improvement in maze CT will be compared with those  that don’t show improvement 
using ANCOVA controlling for age, sex, BMI, race, education and ApoE4 status.  
 Post -hoc analyses : a subset of post -hoc analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_558051]+ and  PiB- at baseline and performing a separate analysis for 
each subset. Stratified analyses will also be performed for men and women, as well as for AAs and whites. 
In addition, we will formally test the impact of PiB status (defined as PiB SUVR≥1.4) on the association of 
sleep measures with longitudinal increases in AD Pi[INVESTIGATOR_557990] . Although we do not anticipate that sleep or SWS 
characteristics will change over the follow -up period, post -hoc analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_558052], using paired sample t -tests to assess the change in outcomes and sleep .  
10 Source Documents and  Access to Source Data/Documents

and in discussion with an investigator, participants will be advised fully  of the procedures to be used, the 
amount of time required of them, the possible risks and benefits of the procedures, their right to refuse 
participation in the study without prejudice, their right to terminate participation at any moment without 
prejudic e, and the name [CONTACT_487929] ([CONTACT_558071]). In the informed 
consent form (ICF), participants will be told that the information they provide and all findings will be kept 
strictly confidential, with access limited to the  research staff and the possible exception of state or federal 
regulatory personnel. Several steps will be taken to minimize reactions of discomfort, embarrassment, 
fatigue, or boredom.  
11.3.1  Consent/Assent and Other Informational Documents Provided to 
Participa nts 
Consent forms describing in detail the study procedures , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting  procedures . The 
following consent materials are submitted wi th this protocol:  
– Documentation of Consent Process  
– Informed Consent Form  
– Screening Form

of consent is necessary in order to avoid wasting participant’s  time if somethi ng makes them clearly 
ineligible.   The pre -screening interview is minimal risk as it involves only the minimum necessary 
information collected to determine eligibility. This will involve the CES -D, MOSS -F, ARES -TM 
questionnaire’s and review of medical his tory and medications history.  For eligible subjects who 
subsequently sign consent/authorization to participate, the information becomes part of the subject’s de -
identified study record.  However, information collected during pre -screening will be destroye d 
immediately if a person is deemed ineligible or decides not to participate in the study . 
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and 
possible benefits of participation will be provided to the participants and their families. Consent forms will 
be IRB -approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the document. The investiga tor will 
explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. All participants will

signed subject authorization informing the subject of the follow ing:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use o f their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period.  
 
Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_558053], their staff, and the

2.0 STUDY SUMMARY  
 
Study Title:  Randomized study of the Shockwave Medical Peripheral Lithoplasty® 
System used in combination with DCB versus standard balloon 
angioplasty used in combination with DCB to treat moderate and severely 
calcified femoropopliteal arteries  (Disrupt  PAD III).  
Study Objective:  The objective of the randomized study is to assess the safety and 
effectiveness of Lithoplasty treatment used in combination with DCB 
versus standard balloon angioplasty used in combination with DCB to treat 
moderate and severely calcified femoropopliteal arteries.   
 
In addition to the randomized study , an observational study  (OS)  of 
subjects who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the 
randomized study will be conducted. The objective of the observational 
study is to assess the real-world acute performance of the Shockwave 
Medical Peripheral Lithoplasty System in the t reatment of calcified, 
stenotic, peripheral arteries.   Once enrollment in the randomized portion of 
the study is complete, subjects may continue to be enrolled in the 
observational study provided they meet OS eligibility criteria.  
Study Device s: Shockwave  Medical Peripheral Lithoplasty  System and Medtronic 
IN.PACT DCB . 
Indications for  Use:  Indications for Use  Outside the [LOCATION_002] : 
The Shockwave Medical Peripheral Lithoplasty® System is indicated for 
lithotripsy -enhanced, low -pressure balloon dilatation of calcified, stenotic 
peripheral arteries in patients who are candidates for percutaneous 
therapy.  
 
The IN.PACT Admiral DCB is indicated for percutaneous transluminal 
angioplasty (PTA) in patients with obstructive disease of peripheral 
arteries, including  patients with in -stent restenosis (ISR) and arteriovenous 
(AV) access to help maintain hemodialysis access in patients with end-
stage renal disease.  
 
Note: While the IN.PACT Admiral DCB is indicated for use in 
patients with end -stage renal disease who require arteriovenous 
(AV) access to help maintain hemodialysis access, and in patients 
with in -stent restenosis, such patients are not being studied in t his 
protocol.

Randomized Study 
Statistical Methods :  The randomized study is powered to show that the Shockwave Medical 
Peripheral Lithoplasty System is superior to standard balloon angioplasty, 
both in the primary effectiveness endpoint of Procedural Success, and in 
the powered secondary effectiveness endpoint of Primary Patency.  
Procedural Success will be assessed on a per -subject basis.  
The objective of the study is to show that the Procedural Success Rate for 
the Lithoplasty treatment arm is greater than the Procedural Success Rate 
for the PTA treatment arm.  The objective is met when the resulting 
Fisher’s Exact test is statistically significant using a one -sided α = 0.[ADDRESS_796984] basis.  
If the primary effectiveness objectiv e is met, then the powered secondary 
effectiveness endpoint will be tested.  The objective of the study is to show 
that the Primary Patency Rate for Lithoplasty followed by [CONTACT_602091].  The objective is met when the resulting Fisher’s 
Exact test is statistically significant using a one -sided α = 0.025  level of 
statistical significance.  
 
The selected baseline variables will be compared between the Lithoplasty 
followed by [CONTACT_602092] . 
Additionally, statistical analyses will be performed for primary and powered 
secondary effectiveness endpoints based on selected subgroups that will 
be defined in the statistical analysis plan.  
 
Primary Ana lysis Set:  
The primary analysis set will be the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population.  The 
ITT population includes all randomized subjects, which is the point of 
subject enrollment.    
 
Secondary Analysis Set:  
The secondary analysis set will be the Per -Protocol (PP) population.  The 
PP population includes all subjects who received the correct randomized 
treatment assignment and had no pre -specified inclusion and exclusion 
violation(s).

3.0 INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Background  
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a chronic occlusive arterial disease caused by 
[CONTACT_602094], which leads to diminished blood flow. Disability and 
mortality associated with PAD has increased over the last [ADDRESS_796992] leading cause of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity behind cardiovascular disease and stroke.1 
Approximately 15-30% of people with lower extremity PAD will progress from 
intermittent claudication (IC) to critical limb ischemia (CLI)3, [ADDRESS_796993] ongoing complications including acute 
procedure failure and long-term restenosis.  Acute procedural failure is the result of 
incomplete vessel expansion with ongoing high-grade stenosis, or flow-limiting 
dissections, both of which occur in those presenting with greater complexity and degree 
of vascular calcification.   Bail-out stenting with a metallic implant is required in these 
situations to ensure vessel patency.   
Lithoplasty is a balloon-based technology that targets calcification to “normalize” vessel 
compliance prior to low pressure dilatation.  Lithoplasty is designed to optimize acute 
gain while minimizing acute vessel injury and reducing bail-out stenting.  In a recent 
presentation of pooled 30-day results of the DISRUPT PAD program, Lithoplasty 
demonstrated compelling effectiveness and safety results in the treatment of moderately 
and severely calcified vessels with minimal vessel injury, and only one stent implanted 
in 95 subjects.  Acute effectiveness results showed high procedural success across all 
types of lesions and a large acute gain of 3.0mm after the procedure.15

3.2.[ADDRESS_796997] Medical Lithoplasty System is a proprietary balloon catheter system 
designed to enhance percutaneous transluminal angioplasty by [CONTACT_602096]. 
The Lithoplasty System consists of a Lithoplasty balloon catheter with five integrated 
pairs of lithotripsy emitters, a Lithoplasty Generator, Connector Cable, and related 
accessories and replacement components. 
The Lithoplasty Catheter is delivered through the peripheral arterial system of the lower 
extremities to the site of an otherwise difficult to treat, calcified stenosis.  The balloon is 
inflated at a lower than nominal pressure and the lithotripsy emitters are energized 
thereby [CONTACT_602097], disrupting calcium within the lesion, and allowing subsequent dilation of a 
peripheral artery stenosis using low balloon pressure.   
 
The balloon is available in 8 sizes:  3.5 mm, 4.0 mm, 4.5 mm, 5.0 mm, 5.5 mm, 6.0 mm, 
6.5 mm, and 7.0 mm diameter and 60 mm length.  The OTW catheter has a working 
length of 110 cm and is compatible with 300 cm length, 0.014” guide wires.  The 
catheter is compatible with 6 or 7Fr introducer sheaths depending on balloon size. The 
catheter tri-lumen hub contains an inflation lumen, a guidewire lumen, and the 
Lithoplasty connector.  The inflation lumen is used for inflation of the balloon with 50/50 
saline/contrast medium.  A Connector Cable is a remote actuator that connects the 
Lithoplasty Generator to the Lithoplasty Catheter and is used to activate energy delivery 
from the Lithoplasty Generator.  
 
The Shockwave S4 Intravascular Lithoplasty Catheter is a line extension and was 
specifically designed to treat calcified below-the-knee (BTK) calcium. Currently, it is 
available for use in the PAD III Observational Study Arm only. 
 
The catheters are available in two sizes of 3.[ADDRESS_796998] Lithoplasty generator and connector cable. The 
ca
theters are 0.014” guidewire and 5F sheath compatible with a 135 cm working 
length.   
 
The Lithoplasty Catheter is supplied sterile via e-beam sterilization.  It is intended for 
single use only and is not intended for reuse or re-sterilization. The Connector Cable 
and Lithoplasty Generator are non-sterile, reusable medical devices.

6.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Screening  
All patients presenting to the institution with known femoropopliteal disease requiring an 
interventional procedure will be evaluated for eligibility and participation in the 
randomized study. A member of the participating site’s study team will perform an initial 
evaluation of the potential participant’s medical history and previously performed 
examinations to assess for initial eligibility. Pre-procedure imaging (DUS, angiogram, 
CTA, MRA) is recommended, but not mandatory if within institution’s standard- of-care to 
confirm stenosis and calcification ahead of procedural angiography.  
P
otential subjects will be screened for eligibility in the randomized study. Written 
informed consent will be obtained prior to any study-specific requirements . A potential 
subject will be informed of the elements of both the randomized and observational 
clinical studies including, risks, potential benefits and required follow-up procedures 
prior to obtaining the potential subject’s informed consent.  No study-specific 
requirements will be performed prior to obtaining informed consent. 
Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the randomized study will undergo 
an angiogram.  At the time of the angiogram, the subject will be randomized if they meet 
the randomized study angiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a guidewire is 
successfully passed through the target lesion.  A subject is considered an angiographic 
screen failure for the randomized study if they do not meet angiographic eligibility.  
 
If the subject does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the randomized study or 
presents with calcified stenosis in the iliac, common femoral or below-the-knee, and 
meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the observational study, the subject may be 
enrolled in the observational study. Once enrollment in the randomized portion of the 
study is complete, subjects may continue to be enrolled in the observational study 
provided they meet OS eligibility criteria. 
6.[ADDRESS_797008] Selection 
Subjects who meet all general and angiographic inclusion criteria and no general and 
angiographic exclusion criteria of the randomized study will be eligible for enrollment in 
the randomized study. Subjects who do not meet the randomized inclusion and 
exclusion criteria (or subjects recruited after enrollment in the randomized portion of the 
study is complete), but meet inclusion and exclusion criteria of the observational study 
will be eligible for enrollment in the observational study.

6.7.4 Randomized Study Treatment Arm Procedure 
Lithoplasty treatment 
A full description of the procedure is detailed in the Instructions for Use (IFU) . The 
appropriate sized Lithoplasty balloon catheter should be selected per the IFU.  Once the 
Lithoplasty balloon is placed in the target lesion area, the balloon should be inflated to 4 
ATM and Lithoplasty treatment delivered for the pre-programmed time of 30 seconds to 
deliver 30 pulses.  Note that the generator is programmed to force a minimum pause 
time of 10 seconds following every 30 pulses delivered.  Following the Lithoplasty, 
inflate the balloon to the reference size using the balloon compliance chart (refer to IFU) 
and record lesion response on fluoroscopy.  Deflate the balloon and wait [ADDRESS_797031]-Lithoplasty results in one of the following below.  The physician should use a 
1:1 balloon catheter to artery ratio and may dilate for up to three minutes.   
 Residual stenosis >30% by [CONTACT_13729], or 
 Presence of a flow-limiting (>Grade D) dissection, and 
 Trans-lesional gradient >[ADDRESS_797032]-dilatation balloon inflations are determined not to be successful.  In 
order to ensure consistency between treatment arms, a provisional stent should be 
placed for an acute PTA failure defined as:

 Residual stenosis ≥50% by [CONTACT_13729], or 
 Un-resolved flow-limiting ( >Grade D) dissection, and 
 Trans-lesional gradient >[ADDRESS_797033] use of a stent based on the criteria above 
for subjects that receive a provisional stent.  As pre-specified, an acute PTA failure 
requiring a stent at any time during the index procedure will be counted as a loss of 
primary patency.   
DCB (Drug-coated balloon) treatment 
Investigators should follow the Medtronic IN.PACT IFU for instructions on the DCB 
procedure.  No additional pre-dilatation will be required after the Lithoplasty procedure 
and before treatment with a DCB.  Ensure the entire vessel segment dilated with a 
Lithoplasty catheter is covered by a DCB to prevent geographic miss. 
Follow procedures to maximize optimal balloon angioplasty results in the IN.PACT IFU 
including a prolonged inflation of the DCB.   
Final angiogram  
Follow the angiographic core lab procedures to complete final angiography showing the 
target lesion with reproducible landmarks for follow-up evaluation and assessment.  In 
addition, a final distal run-off with imaging to the foot shall be performed to assess for 
procedural complications, including distal embolization and thrombus.   
6.7.5 Randomized Study Control Arm Procedure  
PTA treatment 
PTA treatment can be completed with any commercially available semi or non-
compliant PTA balloon catheters.  No specialty balloons including scoring or cutting 
balloons are permitted.  Investigators should follow the manufacturer’s instructions for 
use to size the reference vessel to the manufacturer’s compliance chart. If additional 
lesion area needs to be treated, follow the treatment steps as identified above and per 
the IFU.  The catheter can be advanced to the next treatment area.  Confirm the balloon 
catheter is of the appropriate size for the next treatment area.   
To ensure consistency between the treatment and control arms, dilatation should be 
done for one minute per treatment area.   
P
ost-dilatation with a semi or non-compliant PTA balloon catheter should be completed 
when post-PTA results in one of the following below.  The physician should use a 1:1 
balloon catheter to artery ratio and may dilate for up to three minutes.

8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Introduction 
The randomized study is a prospective, multi-center, single blind, randomized (1:1) 
study of Lithoplasty treatment used in combination with DCB versus standard balloon 
angioplasty used in combination with DCB to treat moderate and severely calcified 
femoropopliteal arteries.  
A maximum of [ADDRESS_797040] on: 
1. Procedural success of the vessel treatment prior to DCB or stenting 
2. Provisional stent rate 
3. Primary patency at [ADDRESS_797041] balloon angioplasty, both in the primary 
effectiveness endpoint of Procedural Success, and in the powered secondary 
effectiveness endpoint of Primary Patency. 
For the primary effectiveness endpoint of Procedural Success, assume the following: 
Statistical Hypothesis: H 0: π Treatment  < π Control  vs H 1: π Treatment  > π Control , 
where π Treatment  is the Procedural Success Rate for the 
Lithoplasty Treatment arm, and π Control  is the Procedural 
Success Rate for the PTA Treatment arm. 
Statistical Test:  Fisher’s Exact test  
Statistical Significance: one-sided α = 0.025  
Statistical Power:  1 – β = 0.80 
Expected Success Rates: π Treatment  = 0.85 and π Control  = 0.62

CLASS:  CLINICAL PROTOCOL  PAGE 44 OF 77 
 
 
Confidential – This document is property of Shockwave Medical, Inc. 
Minimum Sample Size: n =  130 subjects, 65 per treatment arm 
 
For the powered secondary effectiveness endpoint of Primary Patency at 12-Months, 
assume the following: 
Statistical Hypothesis: H 0: π Treatment  < π Control  vs H 1: π Treatment  > π Control, 
where π Treatment  is the Primary Patency Rate for the 
Lithoplasty followed by [CONTACT_602101], and π Control  is 
the Primary Patency Rate for the PTA followed by [CONTACT_602102]. 
Statistical Test:  Fisher’s Exact test  
Statistical Significance: one-sided α = 0.025  
Statistical Power:  1 – β = 0.85 
Expected Success Rates: π Treatment  = 0.78 and π Control  = 0.61 
Minimum Sample Size: n = 284 subjects, 1 42 per treatment arm 
The sample size requirements for the powered secondary effectiveness endpoint 
exceed those for the primary effectiveness endpoint.  As a result, the powered 
secondary effectiveness endpoint will be used to calculate the minimum required 
sample size for the study.  Assuming that roughly 15% of the subjects will be lost- to-
follow-up, a total of 3 34 subjects (1 67 per treatment arm ) is required for the powered 
secondary endpoint. In total, up to 400 subjects may be enrolled.  
The observational study will include a maximum of 1500 subjects. Data collection for 
these subjects will include evaluations at baseline, procedural and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602083].  
 
8.3 Randomized Study Primary Endpoint – Procedural Success 
Procedural success is defined as residual stenosis ≤30% without flow-limiting dissection 
(≥ grade D) prior to DCB or stenting by [CONTACT_141108].   
Procedural Success will be assessed on a per-subject basis. 
The objective of the study is to show that the Procedural Success Rate for the 
Lithoplasty treatment arm is greater than the Procedural Success Rate for the PTA 
treatment arm.  The objective is met when the resulting Fisher’s Exact test is statistically 
significant using a one-sided α = 0.025 level of statistical significance.

8.4 Randomized Study Powered Secondary Effectivenes s Endpoint 
– Primary Patency 
The powered secondary effectiveness endpoint for the randomized study is Primary 
Patency at 12 months defined as freedom from clinically-driven target lesion 
revascularization (TLR) and freedom from restenosis determined by [CONTACT_602098] >50% stenosis.   
Primary Patency will be assessed on a per-subject basis. 
If the primary effectiveness objective is met, then the powered  secondary effectiveness 
endpoint will be tested.  The objective of the study is to show that the Primary Patency 
Rate for the Lithoplasty followed by [CONTACT_602103].  The objective is met when 
the resulting Fisher’s Exact test is statistically significant using a one-sided α = 0.[ADDRESS_797042] Category, ABI, WIQ and EQ-5D 
secondary endpoints. 
 
Additionally, statistical analyses will be performed for primary and powered secondary 
effectiveness endpoints based on selected subgroups that will be defined in the 
statistical analysis plan. 
 
8.6 Randomized Study Secondary Endpoints: 
Other randomized study secondary endpoints include the following: 
 
Safety: 
 MAE at 30 days, 6, 12 and 24 months defined as: 
–

Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical 
signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, 
whether or not related to the study medical device.  
This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the 
comparator.   This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. 
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
An adverse event that  
a) led to death 
b) led to a serious deterioration in the health of a subject that either resulted in

9.1.[ADDRESS_797044] (ADE):   
An adverse device effect is defined as any untoward adverse event related to the use of 
an investigational or study medical device.  
This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate

Adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a 
serious adverse event. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_797046] ([LOCATION_003]DE) 
Serious adverse device effect, which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has 
not been identified in the current version of the Instructions for Use or Risk Management 
Report. 
To further clarify, an Anticipated SADE (ASADE) is considered an effect which by [CONTACT_47720], incidence, severity or outcome has been previously identified in the Instructions 
for Use or Risk Management Report. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_797047] provide a determination of the 
relationship between the use of the medical device (including the medical procedure) 
and the occurrence of each adverse event according to the following categories:  
 
• Causal Relationship (Definite) – The adverse event is clearly related to the study 
device: the event has a temporal relationship to the study device, follows a known 
pattern of response, or is otherwise logically related to the study device, and no 
alternative cause is present. 
 
• Probable – The adverse event is likely related to the study device: the event has a 
temporal relationship to the study device, follows a known or suspected pattern of 
response, or is otherwise logically related to the study device, but an alternative 
cause may be present. 
 
• Possible – The adverse event is unlikely related to the study device: the event does 
not follow a clear temporal relationship to the study device or does not follow a 
known pattern of response, or is otherwise possibly to be due to the subject’s clinical 
state or other modes of therapy.  
  
In some cases, the adverse event may not be adequately assessed because 
information is insufficient or contradictory and/or the data cannot be verified or 
supplemented.  Maximum effort will be made to define and categorize the event and 
avoid these situations.  If relatedness remains uncertain, then classify the event as 
“possible”.

• Unlikely – The adverse event can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_602105]/or the relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant, but additional 
information may be obtained. 
 
• Not Related – The adverse event is clearly not related to the study device: the 
event has no temporal or other relationship to the administration of the 
investigational device follows no known or suspected pattern of response, and an 
alternative cause is present.

12.0 STUDY COMMITTE ES 
12.1 Clinical Events Committee (CEC) 
To meet the ethical responsibilities and standards for research subjects, an independent 
Clinical Events Committee shall serve as forum for adjudication of any major adverse 
events (MAEs) and target lesion/vessel revascularizations (TLR/TVR) in the randomized 
stu
dy. In order to enhance objectivity and reduce the potential for bias, the CEC shall be 
independent of the Sponsor as well as the investigational sites/investigators. 
Observational study AEs will not be adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741]. 
The CEC is made up of clinicians (interventional and non-interventional) with pertinent 
expertise who are not participants in the study and who do not have any other real or 
potential conflicts of interest.  The CEC is charged with the development of specific 
criteria used for the categorization of adverse events and clinical endpoints in the study.  
Criteria will be established for selected complications and clinical events. 
At the onset of the study, the CEC will establish explicit rules outlining the minimum 
amount of data required and the algorithm followed in order to classify an event.  The 
methodology for performing these responsibilities shall be developed and outlined in the 
CEC Charter. Operational provisions shall be established to minimize potential bias 
(i.e., CEC members shall be blinded to the clinical site to the extent possible during 
adverse event review and adjudication). In the case of an MAE with associated imaging, 
the CEC may review imaging assessments to assess the reported event.

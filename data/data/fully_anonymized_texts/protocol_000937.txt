Objectives  / Specific Aims  
 
Head and neck (HNC)  survivors face devastating treatment consequences1-3 that lead to severe disruptions in 
swallowing and speech and directly result in significant weight loss, malnutrition and feeding tube 
dependence.4 These rehabilitation concerns are linked to substantial psychosocial challenges including high 
rates of depression and limitations in social interactions.5-7 HNC caregivers (family/friends who provide 
support) therefore encounter taxing and distressing nutritional caregiving tasks and often feel unprepared to 
carry out critical support efforts at home.[ADDRESS_1072538] inadequately addressed nutritional support needs. Therefore, it is imperative that 
survivorship care planning in this high -burden population includes caregivers and focuses directly on nutrition.  
 
Our interdi sciplinary team has developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested the survivorship needs assessment planning (SNAP) 
tool (NCI 1R21CA173271). The tool is administered in the clinic using touch -screen tablet technology to 
address the specialized needs of HNC survivors and care givers after treatment by [CONTACT_780246]. The system has demonstrated high acceptability and feasibility and is a promising platform for HNC 
survivorship care because it addresses speech challenges, provides an efficient way to collect data from both 
survivors and caregivers and accommodates HNC clinical variability by [CONTACT_780247] -driven plans. 
SNAP has high potential for expansion to support caregivers’ nutritional support efforts beyond the clinic by 
[CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_780218] -need recovery period.  
 
The long -term goal of this research is to improve physical, emotional and social post -treatment 
outcomes in HNC survivors by [CONTACT_67940] a nutrition -focused mobile -Support program to prepare 
and support caregivers. In this unique survivor -caregiver population, we argue for a stepped approach to 
survivorship care planning by [CONTACT_780248] 
(e.g., adequate nutritional intake, weight loss prevention) to address immediate needs. This research builds on 
1) our preliminary studies identifying nu tritional challenges (e.g., lean body mass loss, feeding tube 
dependence) as the most prominent and distressing HNC caregiving focus after treatment, 2) the premise that 
the translation of key oncology rehabilitation recommendations into caregiver -focused support steps will 
facilitate dyads’ teamwork and 3) our promising SNAP tool technology. The goal of this mSupport intervention 
is to improve HNC caregiver preparation after treatment to optimize their roles in and accelerate survivors’ 
nutritional recover y.  
 
Emphasizing a transactional caregiving model and building on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], th is research capi[INVESTIGATOR_780219], whereas our current system serves principally as a clinic tool. We will develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test a caregiver 
nutrition support system to: 1) systematically administer survivor/caregiver nutritional needs assessments after 
completing treatment, 2) generate tailored caregiver -focused nu tritional care plans and 3) provide bi -weekly 
mobile support (encouragement, reminders and tips delivered through messaging and peer videos) to 
caregivers as they manage nutritional needs and concerns during the initial recovery period.

 Page 2 of 20  Specific Aim 1:   To develop and pretest a mobile nutritional support system (needs assessment tool, care 
plan template and mobile messaging program)  for HNC survivor -caregiver dyads at the end of treatment.  
1a). Identify high -priority caregiver nutritional need domains us ing key informant interviews with survivors 
and caregivers and surveys with a national panel of oncology dietitian s. 
1b). Translate key oncology nutritional rehabilitation recommendations into caregiver -focused support 
steps and match care plan resources a nd mobile support messages for each identified need.  
1c). Develop and pretest the needs assessment technology, care plan template and mobile support 
message delivery system with HNC survivors, caregivers and health care providers.  
 
Specific Aim 2:   To pil ot-test the implementation of the mobile support system in 33 HNC dyads (N=6 6). 
2a). Examine the acceptability of using the mobile support system to assess dyads’ nutritional needs, 
generate personalized care plans and deliver caregiver mobile support.  
2b). Examine the feasibility of the mSupport system by [CONTACT_780249] (i.e., ease 
of use, engagement, satisfaction, barriers, unmet needs , preferred data collection modes ), resource 
needs (i.e., staff, time, equipment, ex tension to community), and study methods (i.e., timing, 
recruitment, process/outcome measures).  
2c). Synthesize findings and refine  the mobile support  system in preparation for large -scale evaluation . 
 
This research is novel in its dyadic approach to surv ivorship care planning, its focus on nutritional wellness 
within the context of an HNC rehabilitation model and its extension of a scalable mobile health support system 
to reach caregivers. Results will be used to build a large -scale multi -site trial to im prove HNC survivorship care 
planning with high potential for expansion to comprehensive coverage of recovery issues and other cancers.  
 
Background  
 
HNC caregivers face significant challenges after treatment and their involvement in survivorship care 
planning is essential.  In the [LOCATION_002] in 2016, approximately 61,[ADDRESS_1072539] (oral cavity, pharynx and larynx)[ADDRESS_1072540] step to the provision of resources to build caregiver 
skills.27 As guidelines develop fo r the mandated delivery of treatment summaries and care plans to survivors 
after treatment,28-32 there is a missed opportunity to capi[INVESTIGATOR_780220].33  
 
Devastating nutritional concerns dominate HNC recovery and a stepped dyadic approach to care 
planning may optimize HNC caregivers’ roles in recovery.  HNC functional deficits from multi -modal 
treatments34 result in oral complications (e.g., problems with sw allowing, speech, dry mouth)35-37 that impede 
nutritional intake after treatment38 and the majority (75 -80%) of patients experience significant weight loss.4,39,[ADDRESS_1072541] addressing caregivers’ pressing nutritional support needs at the end of 
treatment and following with a comprehensive dyadic survivorshi p visit29,[ADDRESS_1072542] proven benefits to quality of life and nutritional status.48,49 Importantly, in addition to the extremely 
demanding nutritional care tasks faced by [CONTACT_780250], discordance in perceptions of nutritional challenges 
between patients and caregivers has been observed,8,50 highlighting the potential for mismatched caregiving 
efforts if dyads’ goals are not aligned.  Researchers are beginning to consider use of dynamic delivery 
approaches for dyadic interventions so b oth patient and caregiver needs can be met in a timely fashion.51-53   
 
Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_780221] a framework to advance caregiver 
recovery roles. Oncology -focused rehabilitation54 seeks to enhance functioning within the limits introduced by

Summary.  In this research, w e target the devastating nutritional challenges and their associated quality of life 
implications45,48 faced by [CONTACT_780251]. The assumption underlying the proposed intervention is 
that caregiving skills will be advanced by [CONTACT_780252] (a 
nutritional care plan to prepare caregivers and build teamwork) . We use a sustainable mHealth monitoring 
approach to support caregivers’ roles in nutritional support, seeking to prepare dyads for next recovery steps.  
 
B. Innovation  
 
This study is innovative in its dyadic approach to HNC care and its use of a stepped approach to 
survivorship care planning starting with nutritional recovery and leveraging mHealth.    
• We focus on an understudied, high burden cancer with intense caregiving burden. HNC survivors and 
caregivers face unique challenges and require a specialize d approach to family -centered care.1,7,18,19 As 
the field of survivorship research grows, it is imperative to extend this work to understudied cancers like 
HNC, particularly as the population of patients w ith HPV -associated HNCs increases.80-82 
• Despi[INVESTIGATOR_780223], limited evidence demonstrates improved 
outcomes28,30,31,83-85 and questions remain concerning implementation practi ces to match survivors’ needs. 
We promote a dyadic/stepped approach in HNC starting with nutritional wellness to accelerate recovery.  
• Leveraging mHealth will allow an extension of care planning from clinic to home using our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested 
SNAP tool, a flexi ble platform we will extend to monitor and support caregivers in the treatment transition.  
 
Approach  
 
Overview  
We will 1) develop an HNC caregiver mobile nutritional support system and 2) pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test the system’s feasibility 
and acceptability (Figure 1). Us ing dyadic interviews and surveys with oncology dieti tians, we will characterize 
nutritional support needs and develop the mSupport  system. We will pi[INVESTIGATOR_780224] 4 weeks, tracking feasibility/acceptability for our future trial.

Preliminary Data  
 
HNC dyads are a high -risk group facing significant recovery burden . We recently completed the 
longitudinal CARE study ( under review ) to examine HNC dyads’ experiences (N=73) and identified a diverse 
group of dyads (57% partners) facing significant health concerns. Caregivers had competing demands (e.g., 
60% employed, 43% cared for oth er family) and both patients and caregivers had significant depression Key Informant interviews :

 Page 4 of 20  (CESD >10) at diagnosis. In 43% of dyads, both the patient and caregiver were depressed and this pattern was 
more likely when patients had worse symptoms ( p=.006) such as dry mouth and s wallowing concerns. 
Caregiver depression was associated with lower dyadic copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or teamwork in managing cancer (p<.05). Also, 
>40% of dyads needed help with care coordination and understanding cancer. One -third of caregivers reported 
symptom management a ssistance needs and were interested in connecting with a peer caregiver.  
 
Nutrition is the primary caregiving concern and a promising focus for the first step in care 
planning . The CARE study highlighted significant nutritional recovery concerns (N=65; 47%  taking 
supplements, 29% on feeding tube, 33% lost weight in past week).  Also, >50% of survivors reported severe 
problems with dry mouth, sticky saliva, pain killer use and worry about family.
  Qualitative interviews showed 
caregivers provided unique support focused primarily on distressing tasks of food preparation and feeding tube 
assistance. In another study ( MRSG -12-221-01-CPPB) , [ADDRESS_1072544] -treatment 
concern and intensified all other recovery issues. Caregivers were overwhelmed and intensely focused on 
nutrition and feeding tube care. They reported putting survivors’ preferences first (e.g., eating in another room 
to give survivor privacy when struggling to eat, doing everything possible to hel p prevent feeding tube, 
preparing food several ways to find something appetizing). Dyads reported enthusiasm about a survivorship 
program but patients preferred waiting [ADDRESS_1072545] significant challenges right after treatment (77%).  
 
The SNAP tool demonstrated feasibility and acceptability in the HNC clinic . Our team recently 
completed NCI [ADDRESS_1072546] the SNAP tool (N=[ADDRESS_1072547] -treatme nt HNC dyads). At least half of 
survivors endorsed problems with appetite, tasting food, difficulty swallowing and choking/coughing at the 
survivorship visit; 58% were not taking normal food at this time. While 39% of survivors reported dissatisfaction 
with their nutritional status, more (54%) caregivers were dissatisfied. The majority (77%) were flagged and 
offered a referral to the oncology dietitian ; caregivers were often more interested than survivors. Dyads 
reported high SNAP satisfaction with the majo rity in strong agreement that the session helped prepare them for 
life after treatment (85% survivors, 81% caregivers) and provided useful practical (88% survivors, 73% 
caregivers) and emotional (77% survivors, 73% caregivers) aid. Most participants (>95%)  reported high 
comfort reading questions on tablets, moving from 1 question to another and understanding next follow -up care 
steps. Lastly, nurses conducting survivorship visits reported favorable outcomes, with >90% in high agreement 
that the session leng th was appropriate and that dyads were engaged/prepared for next care steps.  
 
Our preliminary studies : 1) justify the focus (caregiver nutritional care plan), content and delivery 
scheme for the proposed intervention, 2) demonstrate the promise of SNAP, o ur flexible care planning 
platform and 3) highlight our team’s t echnology development experience and success in conducting 
mixed methods studies with HNC dyads and providers.  
 
Intervention  to Be Studie d  
 
As highlighted above in F igure 1, this 2-phase study will develop (phase 1) and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test (phase II) a mobile -
Support program for HNC survivors and their caregivers .  The resulting system will include three elements to : 
1) systematically administer survivor/caregiver nutritional needs assessments at the end of  treatment, 2) 
generate tailored caregiver -focused nutritional care plans and 3) provide bi -weekly mobile support 
(encouragement, reminders and tips delivered through messaging and peer videos) to caregivers as they 
manage nu tritional needs and concerns during the initial recovery period  (see Figure  2).

Version # 10; Version Date 06/17/[ADDRESS_1072548] 15 key informant interviews with HNC  
patients and their primary caregivers and administer surveys to an expert panel of oncology dietitians  (N=35) .  
We will also conduct cognitive interviews to pretest our mSupport program with 2 patients and their caregivers 
(N=4) and [ADDRESS_1072549] the delivery of t he mSupport  system  in the HCC clinic with 33 patients and 
their primary caregivers  (N=66) and follow with 4 weeks of mobile monitoring and support .  Participants will 
complete a follow -up interview 6 weeks following the clinic session.  Finally, we will ho ld individual or small 
group interviews  with health care providers (N=10) to pi[INVESTIGATOR_780226] . 
 
The sections that follow are organized by [CONTACT_45968]. As described in detail below, all patients and their 
caregivers will be recruited through t he HCC Multi -Disciplinary Head and Neck Tumor Program.  Patient and 
caregiver data will be collected by [CONTACT_6270] -report in key informant interviews, in -person clinic interviews and 
telephone , mailed or emailed  follow -up interviews.  In addition, we will collect patient clinical data from the 
electronic medical record.  Multi -disciplinary health care specialists involved in the care of HNC  patients will be 
recruited at the HCC and around the state of South Carol ina and provide data in web -based surveys and 
interviews . 
 
Phase 1  Outcomes :  
1. We will characterize post-treatment nutritional experiences (e.g., expectations, challenges, interactions 
between survivors, caregivers and providers and experiences returning ho me after treatment ) and 
gather feedback about the timing, content and format of our mSupport tool using key informant 
interviews wit h HNC survivors and caregivers . 
2. We will assess oncology dietitian perceptions of HNC caregiver s’ nutritional support demands  and 
psychosocial concerns  using a cross -sectional survey of a panel of dietitians .

Recruitment Methods  and Consent Process  
 
Phase I Key Informant Interviews . We will conduct key informant  interviews with patients and their  caregivers  
in person in a private interview room .  As in our previous studies, research staff will review clinic rosters to 
identify potentially eligible patients who meet study c riteria and are scheduled for a follow -up care appointment 
at the Hollings Cancer Center. These potential participants will be approached in the clinic or mailed a study 
recruitment letter and provided with written study information. After reviewing the study and answering any 
questions, we will schedule interviews with those who are eligible and interested in participating in the study.  
 
During recruitment, patients will be asked to select their primary caregivers (i.e., spouse, family member, 
friend), or the individual on whom they rely primari ly for support;  if patients are unable to identify a supporter, 
they may still participate in the study. All potential patients and caregivers will be allowed to discuss the study 
individually or in pairs based on their preferences.  If caregivers are present in the clinic , study staff will provide 
the caregiver the opportunity to ask questions if interested in participating in the study. If the caregiver is not 
present, patients will be asked to consult with their nominated caregiver before providing caregiver contact 
[CONTACT_780259]. Once caregiver contact [CONTACT_780260], research staff will attempt to contact [CONTACT_780261]. If a home address is 
obtained for the caregiver, a letter  will be mailed to the caregiver. An information letter will describe the study in 
more detail and will ask the caregiver to contact [CONTACT_780262]. Similarly, 
if the caregiver is contact[CONTACT_5143], the study staff  will describe the study in more detail and answer any 
questions. If we do not receive a response from the caregiver, we will then follow up the mailing with no more 
than ten attempted phone calls at different times. We will leave no more than two messages. A copy of all 
recruitment correspondence will be kept on file.  
 
Informed consent  and HIPAA forms  will be signed in person before the interview is conducted after individuals 
have time to read over the consent on their own and the research staff describe the  elements of the study and 
answer any questions.  All participants will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_780233]. The 
Principal Investigator , trained Study Coordinator, Research Assistant and health care providers on our study 
team will a dminister  consents.  Participants (patients and caregivers) will receive $25 gift cards to Walmart and 
parking vouchers.    
 
Phase I Oncology Dietitian Surveys . Participants (N=35) will be recruited through the Oncology Nutrition 
Dietetic Practice Group (https://www.oncologynutrition.org/) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics listserv. 
Volunteers will be contact[CONTACT_780263] a  web-based 20 -minute REDCap  (Research Electronic 
Data Capture),[ADDRESS_1072556] lottery for a $[ADDRESS_1072557] the mSupport tool.  We will recruit individuals who comple ted their primary treatment (i.e., any 
combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy) within the past [ADDRESS_1072558] his or her primary caregiver. We will recruit 2 patient s, 
2 caregivers and 2 nurses to participate in the cognitive interviews.  Patients and caregivers will receive a $25 
Version # 10; Version Date 06/17/[ADDRESS_1072559] to Walmart and parking voucher to thank them for their time and effort in the study.  Nurses will 
receive a $[ADDRESS_1072560] to Target to thank them for their time.   
 
Informed consent and HIPAA forms will be signed in person before the interview is  conducted after the 
research staff describe the elements of the study and answer any questions for patients and caregivers. All 
participants will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_780234]. The  Principal Investigator, trained 
Study Coordi nator, Research Assistant and health care providers  on our study team will administer consents.  
Participants (patients and caregivers) will receive $25 gift cards to Walmart and parking vouchers.  A waiver of 
written or signed consent has been requested f or the cognitive interviews with clinic nurses; information about 
the study will be provided prior to scheduling and beginning the small group discussion and participation will 
indicate implied consent.  
 
Phase II mSupport Pi[INVESTIGATOR_780235] . As in our previous studies, research staff will 
review clinic rosters to identify potentially eligible patients who meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria . 
These potential participants may be approached in the clinic (if safe and feasible  based on clinic requirements 
during the COVID -19 pandemic ) or provided written study information via a flyer or mailed study recruitment 
letter.  Staff will follow -up with potential participants either by [CONTACT_780264] y and answer 
any questions.  
 
If eligible and interested, study staff will use the REDCap combined e-consent /HIPAA  template to conduct the 
informed consent process . Informed consent and HIPAA forms will be signed after individuals have time to 
read over the consent on their own and the research staff describe the elements of the study and answer any 
questions.  
• If a participant is being enrolled virtually, the participant and stud y staff will acces s the consent form

• If a p articipant is recruited in -person , study staff will follow a similar process. Using a tablet, the 
participant and study staff will access the consent form online. Participants will walk through the study 
purpose, procedures, risks and benefits and have the opportunity to ask questions.  Participants will 
electronically sign forms, study staff will also electronically sign the forms, and participants will receive 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_780237]/email.  
 
The Principal Investigator, trained Study Coordinator, Research Assistant and health care providers on our 
study team will administer consents. These procedures will be done on our research team's laptop and/or 
tablet, but no data w ill be stored on either device; all data will be stored securely in REDCap.  
 
If technology challenges arise, study staff may also use a combined consent/HIPAA hard copy form  (printed 
from REDCap),  either in -person or sent through the mail.  During the consent/assent phone call, research staff 
will ensure all questions are answered. The participant will sign and date the forms and return to the study 
staff. Study staff will sign and date the forms an d will mail/email a copy to the participant.  No study activities 
will be conducted until both the participant and study staff have signed  and dated  the informed consent/HIPAA 
documents.  
 
After enrollment, participants will be given the option to complete  the baseline /needs assessment survey by 
[CONTACT_756] , mail, or online . After  this survey is complete, study staff will schedule  either: an in-person clinic 
session (if safe and feasible  based on clinic requirements during the COVID -19 pandemic ); or a virtual session . 
Either will be  convenient ly timed for participants  schedule . In either scenario, participants will receive  and 
review a tailored care plan , which includes  messages, referrals and educational materials.  In-person study  
activities will take place in a private clinic office or conference room in a location that is convenient for the 
participants  and will conform to university COVID -19 safety recommendations. The virtual visit will be 
conducted via telephone or d oxy.me  with care plans being provided electronically or by [CONTACT_2319] .

overview of the mobile app and links to training videos.  After the study session , study staff will prepare the final 
care plan with referrals and educational materials and mail a study packet with gift cards to participants . Six-
eight weeks later, participants will complete follow -up surveys by [CONTACT_756], mail or email.  Both the patient and 
caregiver  participant s will receive $50 (two $[ADDRESS_1072561] s) after completing the initial survey and clinic /virtual 
session ($25) and the follow -up survey  ($25) .  
Study Design  / Methods  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_1072562] interviews until we reach saturation in themes. All interview participants will be asked to 
complete a short demographic survey (<5 minutes ) to characterize group participants. In addition, information 
about each patient’s medical history will be obtained from the electronic medical record. Interviews will last 
approximately [ADDRESS_1072563] , cognitively pretested and administered to a panel of 
dietitian s. We will assess  key caregiver nutritional support tasks and perceptions of caregiver nutritional support 
demands, psychosocial concerns and barriers (Table 1) . Participants will view/rate a mock care plan and video, 
offering suggestions to improve content.  
 
 Table 1. Su rvey Measures for Oncology Dietitian  Experts (Aim 1)  
Domain  Description/Rationale  
Primary nutritional 
support tasks  • Ratings of importance (Not at All to Extremely), perceived task demand difficulty (Not at All to Extremely), and 
clarity of wording (Poor to Excellent) of key HNC nutritional caregiving support tasks and healthcare barriers.  
Resource priority  • Ranking of key caregiver resources identified to support HNC nutritional needs (adapted from our prior work).  
Barriers to meet 
caregiver needs  • Barriers to meeting needs of caregivers (e.g., time, specialized training, leadership support) in a variety of care 
settings will be assessed using a tool designed by [CONTACT_780265] (see Preliminary Data).   
Acceptability  • After review of mock care plan, messages and video, participants will complete ratings concerning acceptability 
adapted from our prior SNAP measures (Not at All Satisfied to Extremely Satisfied).  
Demographics  • Specialty, patient volume, years in practice, age, gender, rac e/ethnicity.  
 
Aim I Data Management and Analysis.  Interviews will be transcribed and analyzed using rigorous content 
analysis methods for systematic theme identification.95,96 Themes will be compared wit hin/across survivor -
caregiver groups. Transcripts will be coded by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Sterba and study staff and regrouped and reorganized until 
investigators agree on categories.  This initial theme identification process will be followed by [CONTACT_780266]. Expert survey responses will be summarized and 
guide the content, format and delivery of the mSupport system.  
 
Intervention Development.  Building on Aim 1 interview/survey findings, final needs assessment d omains that 
Version # 10; Version Date 06/17/[ADDRESS_1072564] . Brief (3 -6) minute peer videos of volunteer HNC dyads and nurses will be 
developed by [CONTACT_780267], support and meal 
preparation tips.  Table 2 outlines caregiving skills from the transactional model mapped to HNC recovery 
domains and example tailored mSupport  elements. The finalized system will undergo pretesting97 with dyads 
(N=2, $[ADDRESS_1072565]) and nurses (N=2 , $[ADDRESS_1072566] ) to gather feedback on content, layout and assessment 
experiences. A convenience sample of dyads will complete the mSupport protocol and a cognitive pretesting 
guide will be used to examine users’ experie nces.97  After a demonstration, nurses will provide feedback about 
clinic feasibility. Findings will guide the team to finalize the system.

Technology Development . Our Software Systems Developers from the MUSC Technology Applications 
Center for Healthy Living (TACHL) developed the SNAP tool and care plan template. The HIPAA and FERPA -
compliant SNAP tool is an Enterprise Data Management System with a data collection application and 
personalized care report delivery component. The web -based interfaces feed into REDCap 94 a secure 
application supporting validated data entry, audits, import/export procedures and branching logic. A wireless 
touchscreen tablet devi ce renders a web -based interface designed for ease of data collection with color 
displays, large font, pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], and skip patterns. The system authenticates to a data tracking system, registers 
assessments, records data and, based on administrator -designat ed logic, generates a tailored care plan with a 
care summary page followed by [CONTACT_780269], referrals and listing of educational materials mapped to 
reported concerns, symptoms and behaviors of patients and caregivers. Capi[INVESTIGATOR_780238], in this study we will tailor the system to focus on nutrition and enhance the tool to incorporate mSupport 
(see Figure 2 above ). The  IT development phase will include needs assessment customization, mSupport App 
interface design, and testing. Future  deployment will be supported by [CONTACT_780270]’s web -based access for easy 
community dissemination.  
 
The mobile intervention will support caregivers at home and reinforce caregiving skills discussed at the clinic. 
mSupport will include 4 weeks of bi -weekly monitori ng of survivor nutrition status and caregiver distress, needs 
and perceptions of survivors’ nutrition status. Based on timing preferences, a schedule of prompts will be 
delivered to each dyad; based on real -time responses to nutritional status and distress  items, tailored links to 
App resources  will follow. mSupport  will provide a platform for real -time assessment of nutritional challenges 
and will address needs through coaching with support messages and videos. Survivor -caregiver 
communication will be facilitated by [CONTACT_780271]. Guided by  [CONTACT_56049] C linical 
Advisory Board , the system will be optimized to assess/address actionable support needs that can be linked to 
mobile support resources; this will set the stage for cost -effective future dissemination. For tracking purposes 
and to assure conne ction with the study Social Worker if needed, participants will be queried weekly for unmet 
needs.   
 
Aim 2 Methods  
 
mSupport System Pi[INVESTIGATOR_62701] . Patients and caregivers will complete a 30 minute baseline  and needs 
assessment  survey by [CONTACT_756] , mail or online . They will then be schedule d for either an in-person  or virtual (via 
doxy.me  or telephone ) visit at a convenient time.  We will then deliver the intervention  in a 30-45 minute in-
person or virtual session.  The intervention include s several activities, including a care plan discussion  with a 
Version # 10; Version Date 06/17/21  
 Page 12 of 20  Nurse Practitioner (in person , telephone  or using doxy.me ), and app training for caregivers , which will be 
accomplished with a series of short training videos . App training will be followed by [ADDRESS_1072567] resear ch activities in a private conference 
room in this location. In in-person or virtual scenario s, a tailored  care plan will be generated  and reviewed with 
our Nurse Investigator . 
 
Within  the virtual or in -person session  or at later date based on preference , caregivers will receive training on 
mSupport technology  through a series of short training videos . Caregivers will then be prompted twice a week for 
4 weeks to report symptoms , nutritional status and distress with alg orithm -driven links to 3 support sources, 
including messages, tips and peer videos ( see Table 2 above ). We may contact [CONTACT_780272]. Participants will also complete a [ADDRESS_1072568] in -depth interviews with nurse practi tioners who participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_780239]. (N=2, $[ADDRESS_1072569])  
 
Lastly, after completing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we  will conduct 45 -minute audiotaped individual/small group interviews  with 8 
HNC health care providers (a surgeon, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, nurses, dental, speech, and 
nutrition specialists, and community providers) to evaluate  feasibility and recommendations for future syst em 
extension for broader reach in other care settings . (N=8, $25)  
 
Aim 2 Data Management  and Analysis. Descriptive statistics across and within dyads will characterize 
patient and caregiver needs and system acceptability. Preferences by [CONTACT_545], sex, stage and cancer site will be 
explored using descriptive statistics and graphics (bar charts, plots) to highlight future intervention directions. 
To explore potential effect sizes for future research, average change  in future trial outcome variables  from 
baseline to follow -up will be estimated and 95% confidence intervals calculated. Content analysis will be used 
to examine themes in open -ended responses provided by [CONTACT_780273] (with differences explored by [CONTACT_4321]) and 
provid ers. Finally, tracking records will be reviewed to assess program delivery, adherence and preferences

Risks to Subjects  
 
During all phases of this study, including key informant interviews, online surveys, cognitive interviews, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -
test sessions, telephone surveys and discussion groups, there are no physical, legal or financial risks to 
participating in this study. However , there is the possibility participants (patients, caregivers and health care 
providers) could feel uncomfortable or upset talking about their (or their patients’) cancer during study 
interviews. In addition, participants will provide information during st udy interviews that they may consider 
confidential or private and there is the potential for a loss of confidentiality.  
 
Protections of Risk  
 
To help ensure subject privacy and confidentiality for all phases of this study, only a unique study 
identifier wi ll appear on all data collection forms and files.  Key informant and discussion group  
participants will be asked not to share information discussed in the study  with others.  Information 
obtained during this study will be stored in a locked file cabinet in  a locked office.  For all phases of this 
study, only study staff will have access to individually identifiable private information about human 
subjects (i.e., patients, caregivers, and health care providers).  All data collected for the study will be 
code d with a study identification number for confidentiality and all study records will be stored in a 
locked file cabinet in a locked study personnel's office.  Patient data will be entered and stored using 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure,  web application designed to support data 
capture for research studies at MUSC, providing user -friendly web -based case report forms, real -time 
data entry validation (e.g. for data types and range checks), audit trails and a de -identified data export 
mechan ism to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus). The database is hosted at 
the MUSC Datacenter and the system is protected behind a login and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
encryption. No reference to any individual participant will appear in r eports, presentations, or 
publications that may arise from the study.  Virtual visits will be conducted over telephone or using 
doxy.me, a HIPAA compliant video chat application.  
 
Study staff will complete a screening log to verify eligibility for all participants. The screening log will be 
kept with signed informed consent forms in a locked cabinet in a locked office and will be kept separate 
from all other study materials, which w ill be assigned a study ID in an effort to protect patient 
confidentiality. The screening log will be completed for patients and caregivers who agree to participate 
in the study and will include information including age, distance from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], contact [CONTACT_82753], and 
patient -caregiver relationship. In addition, patients will have their MRN, type of cancer, date of 
diagnosis, date of last treatment, and whether this cancer diagnosis is a primary diagnosis or a 
Version # 10; Version Date 06/17/21  
 Page 14 of 20  recurrent diagnosis recorded on the screening  log. A screening decline log will be kept for patients and 
caregivers that are approached regarding the study, but decline participation. The screening decline log 
will not include any identifiable information, but it will provide information including ag e, race, distance 
from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], cancer site and stage, days since final treatment, and reason for decline if the individual 
wishes to provide that information to study staff.  
 
For all phases of this study, one’s decision to take part in this research will  be voluntary and individuals may 
refuse to take part, or choose to stop taking part at any time. Participants will also be encouraged to take their 
time when answering questions and may decline to answer any question at any time. If patients or caregivers  
become upset talking about their cancer and their needs, they will be offered a referral to the HCC Behavioral 
Medicine program (which is covered by [CONTACT_516565]) or the HCC Social Worker who will 
offer links to other HCC and community r esources.  
 
Potential Benefits to Subjects  or Others  
 
In this research, receiving information about survivorship and nutritional recovery may or may not benefit 
patients, caregivers and health care providers personally in the study.  It is hoped that the information learned 
in this study will benefit other HNC patients in the future by [CONTACT_780274].  
 
Study Monitoring  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_780241].  Any unanticipated problems, adverse events, deviations or protocol 
changes will be promptly reported by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_780242].

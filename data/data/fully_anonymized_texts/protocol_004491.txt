Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  2011 -001240-29
Confidential 2Rationale for Amendment 4
The length of the follow -up period has been changed to align with the content of the 
pediatric investigation plan ( PIP).  The PIP states that patients will be followed for safet y 
and survivalfor [ADDRESS_577567] 
been revised to state that patients will be followed for progression- free surviva l and overall 
survival (OS) every  12 weeks for 12 months after the E nd of Treatment ( EOT)visit.  
Thereafter, assessment for OS will continue every  [ADDRESS_577568] overall response rate (ORR)(which waspreviously  written as ORR) .  
The following changes have been made to the inclusion/exclusion criteria : The inclusion 
criterion for total bilirubin has been revised to include patients with total serum bilirubin ≤ 3 
times the upper limit of thenormal range (ULN) if the abnormal value is due to indirect 
hyperbilirubinemia due to Gilbert’s disease.  P atients with elevated alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values [ADDRESS_577569] dose of study  drug, 
respectivel y.  These changesmake it possible for patients to receive treatment s oonerbut 
with a sufficient amount of time for posttransplant recovery. This amendment also includes 
a change to the exclusion criterion for cytochrome P450 ( CYP) 3A4 inhibitors to exclude
both strong and listed moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 within [ADDRESS_577570] been added to the Risks in Children section to align with 
updates to the safet y profile of brentuximab vedotin : Stevens-Johnson sy ndrome (SJS), 
pancreatitis , hepatotoxicity  (elevated AST and ALT). 
The amendment also updates the protocol to align with the current Millennium protocol 
standards, and clarifies the collection and reporting requirements for serious adverse e vents 
(SAEs) that are considered to be drug related to alignwith the current guidelines of the 
Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance .  
Purposes for Amendment4

Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  2011 -001240-29
Confidential 7Overview of Study Design:   This is a phase 1/2, open-label, single -agent, multicenter, 
dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL 
or HLfor which standard, curative, life -prolonging, or palliative treatment does not exist or is no 
longer effective .  Patients with primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma will be eligible during phase 1.  
The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics, and determine the 
pediatric MTD and/or RP2Dof brentuximab vedotin in pediatric patients .  In addition, the 
immunogenicity and antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin will be evaluated in eligible patients.
Overall response will be evaluated beginning after 2cycles of therapy .  
Objective response over the 
course of th e study will be assessed by [CONTACT_223225] (IRF) according to the 
International Working Group (IWG) Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma .(1)
Patients, including those who achieve a CR, PR, or stable disease may receive brentuximab vedotin
for up to 16 cycles.  Treatment with brentuximab vedotin beyond 16 cycles may be permitted at the 
joint discretion of the sponsor and the investigato r for those patients experiencing continued clinical 
benefit.  Following administration of the final dose of brentuximab vedotin, patients will be 
monitored for adverse events for a minimum of 30 days.  Patients will be followed for progression -
free surviv al (PFS)and overall survival (OS) every 12 weeks for 12 months after the end of 
treatment (EOT) visit.  Thereafter, assessment for OS will continue every [ADDRESS_577573] patient. Patients who
remain on treatment after Cycle 16 will be followed according to the above schedule or until study 
closure.
Sample Size Determination:   Approximately 42evaluable patients will be enrolled in this study .  In 
the phase1 portion o f the study, at least12patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ malignancies 
will be enrolled in 2 planned dose cohorts (3-6patients per cohort), according to the standard 3 +3 
dose escalation scheme.
Once the pediatric MTDand/or RP2D havebeen reac hed, patients will be enrol led by [CONTACT_452959]2 study arms: relapsedor refractory sALCL or relapsed or refractory HL.  A sufficient 
number of patients will be enrolled in the phase2portion of the study to have 
at least 15evaluable 
patients with sALCL (including patients treated at the RP2D during phase 1), of whom at least 
10patients are in first relapse, and at least 15evaluable patients with HL (including patients treated 
at RP2D during phase 1).
The sample size is not based on statist ical consideration.  Based on the exact binomial confidence 
interval (CI) calculation, 10 responses observed from 15evaluable patients (overall response rate of 
66.7%)will provide 95% CI (38%, 88%) .
Study Population:   The study will enroll m ale or fema le patients aged 2 to <18 years, with relapsed 
or refractory sALCL or HL (5 to <18 years for HL), and radiographically or clinically evaluable 
tumor per the IWG revised response criteria(patients diagnosed with any relapsed or refractory 
CD30+ hematological malignancy may be included in phase 1 of the study) .  Anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) status must be documented for patients with sALCL.  
Patients with HL must have 
failed systemic chemotherapy, either as induction therapy for advanced -stage disease or salvage 
therapy after initial radiotherapy for early stage disease, and be ineligible for, re fused, or previously 
received a stem cell transplant .  Patients with sALCL must be beyond first remission or refractory to 
front-line chemotherapy
.
Patients with a current diagnosis of primary cutaneous ALCL, or who received any of the following:
allogeneic stem cell transplant < 3monthsbeforethe first dose of study medication, systemic therapy 
for chronic graft versus host disease, immu nosuppressive therapy, any anti -CD30 antibody, 
therapeutic monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs)within the longer of 6 weeks or 5 plasma half -lives, local 
palliative radiation therapy within 14 days,or radiation therapy to more than 25% of bone 
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  [ADDRESS_577574] dose, or prior autologous hematopoietic stem 
cell infusion <4weeks prior to first study dose will be excluded from the study .  Patients with 
symptomatic cardiac disease, history of another primary malignancy not in remission for at least 
3years (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer and cervical carcinoma in situ on biopsy or a squamous 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_451367]), or known cerebral/meningeal disease, including signs or 
symptoms or any history of PML,will be excluded.
Duration of Study:   Following a screening period to determine eligibility, patients may receive up 
to 16 cycles (21 days per cycle) of treatment with brentuximab vedotin.  Patients will be foll owed for 
at least 2 years from enrollment, until the sooner of death or study clo sure.  Extended brentuximab 
vedotin therapy, beyond 16 cycles, may be permitted at the joint discretion of the sponsor and 
investigator for those patients experiencing continued clinical benefit.  The overall expected study 
duration is approximately 5 years.

1.1   Scientific Background
1.1.1   Disease Under Treatment
[IP_ADDRESS]   Hodgkin Lymphoma in Pediatric Pop ulation
Classical Hodgkin l ymphoma (HL)is defined histopathologically  by [CONTACT_452960] -Reed-Sternberg (H/ RS) cells in a background of inflammatory  cells.  
H/RS cells are characterized by  [CONTACT_20376]30, a surface tumor marker a nd cell 
membrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamil y.  HL 
occurs in patients in all age groups and presents a bimodal distribution with peaks at 15 to 
35years of age and over the age of 60 .(2)  The median age at diagnosis is [ADDRESS_577592] nonexistent in those under 2 years of age .(3, 4)
Painless cervical l ymphadenopathy  is the most common presenting sign (>70%)in children 
with HL, often with a fluctuating course leading to a delay  in diagnosis .(5)  Mediastinal 
masses are frequent (about 60% of pediatric patients) and sometimes discovered after 
routine chest X-rays.  Patients with mediastinal adenopathy  may present with respi[INVESTIGATOR_452934], chest pain, or cough .  Fewer than 5% present with 
disease limited to the upper cervical l ymph nodes, above the level of the hyoid bone .  
Disseminated ly mphadenopathy  is rare in patients with HL , as is involvement of Waldey er’s 
ring and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307], epi[INVESTIGATOR_60775], posterior mediastinal, and mesenteric sites .(5, 6)  
Approximately  25% of patie nts will have sy stemic B symptoms at presentation (as defined 
by [CONTACT_452961] s ystem), typi[INVESTIGATOR_452935], fever, weight loss, and night sweats .  Pruritus 
and intermittent fever usually  associated with night sweats are classic s ymptoms of HL .  The 
frequency of these s ymptoms increases with advanced stage of the disease .(5, 6)
Accurate disease staging and classific ation of the histological subty pe determine the most 
favorable treatment options and prognosis.(7, 8, 9)  The stage of the disease is assigned 
according to the Ann Arbor staging s ystem with Cotswold modifications for HL .  All cases 
are subclassified to indicate the absence (A) or presence (B) of the s ystemic symptoms at 
presentation.(8, 10)  Pediatric patients are more likely than adults to present with stage I/II 
disease and less likel y to present with stage IV disease.  Adolescents are more likely  to have 
B symptoms than pediatric patients y ounger than [ADDRESS_577593] a much higher relapse 
rate.(11)
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  [ADDRESS_577594] treatment of pedia tric patients with HL requires a risk- based approach .  This 
ensures that those with good prognosis, low -risk disease can be managed with regimens 
associated with minimal toxicity , while those at high risk of treatment failure can be treated 
more aggressive ly.  Low-risk disease presents favorably  and is usually  defined as localized 
disease (stage I and II), no bulky  disease and absence of B s ymptoms.  Intermediate -risk 
disease has been defined as all stage I and II patients not classified as early stage and 
stageIIIA.  High-risk disease generally  means patients with stage IIIB and IV disease at 
presentation.  Those with favorable risk disease t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_128788] 2 to 4 cycles of 
combination chemotherapy  with low -dose involved field radiotherapy  (IFRT), whereas
those with higher -risk disease receive more intensive chemotherap y before IFRT.  In 
contrast to the treatment of adult patients with HL, IFRT remains an important component of 
the treatment of advanced- stage HL in pediatric patients .(12, 13, 14)
HL is the childhood cancer with the highest cure rates with current OS more than 90% in 
low-stage disease and up to 70% for disseminated disease.(13, 15, 16, 17)  Five-year event-free 
survival in pediatric HL is approximately  80 to 85% .(18)  Pediatric patients less than 10 years 
of age had a significantl y improved freedom from relapse and survival in comparison with 
adolescents and a highly significant improved outcome compared with adults .  Although 
pediatric patients present high cure rates, multi-agent regimens confer a significant 
morbidity , including secondary  malignancies, cardiovascular disease, male infertility , 
pulmonary  diseases,and infections .(19, 20, 21, 22)  Some of the serious sequelae of radiation and 
alkylating chemotherap y are most pronounced in younger patients, in whom growth and 
development are particularly  active when therapy  is administered .  In addition, cardiac 
toxicity appears to be age related, with younger patients at the highest risk .  Secondary  
malignancies represent the leading cause of mortality  in survivor patients with HL.(8, 23)
Approximately  10to 20% of patients presenting with HL  will become refractory  to initial 
therapy or will relapse .  Given the high rate of success of initial treatment for pediatric HL, 
little has been published on the optimal management for relapsed or refractory patients .  
Historical data reveal that children managed initially  with radiation alone and who then 
relapse can achieve cure (as hig h as 85%), whereas those who were initially  treated with 
multi-agent chemotherapy or combined modality therap y have an unfavorable prognosis and 
are much more likel y to subsequently experience treatment failure .(14)  For patients with 
favorable disease at diagnosis, eg, with relapse confined to an area of initial involvement 
after chemotherap y and no radiation, salvage therapy consists of further chemotherap y and 
low-dose IFRT.  Patients w ith an early relapse (between 3-12 months from the end of 
therapy) had a 10 -year event-free survival ( EFS)of 55% and a 5 -year OSof 78%; those with 
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  2011 -001240-29
Confidential 25a late relapse (more than 12 months from the end of therap y) had a 10 -year EFS and OS of 
86% and 90%, r espectively .(24, 25, 26)  For these patients, there is little or no possibility  that 
standard-dose chemotherapy  will prove to be effective .  High-dose chemotherap y plus 
allogeneic stem cell transplant ( alloSCT)is the only  curative option in both pediatric and 
adult patients.(27)
Transplantation -related mortality  rates of more than 20% and even higher relapse rates in 
pediatric and adult series compromise the survival benefit.  Patients who experience relap se 
or progressive HL post -alloSCTfare dismally  and represent a clear unmet need.(28)  A 
pooled anal ysis from 5 international transplant centers of 756 patients who experienced 
relapsed HL after autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT)revealed a median survival of 
2.4years, with fewer than 10% of patients alive at [ADDRESS_577595] changed dramaticall yto reduce these 
toxicitieshigh -dose radiation therapy  is no longer utilized ,chemotherap y regimens utilize 
lower doses of alky lating agents, h ybrid regimens allow for lower doses of anthracycline 
and bleomy cinminimizing the current late effects in patients receiving modern therap y.  
However, there is still a need to investigate the efficacy  and safety  of these regimens versus
chemotherap y alone in children and adolescents .  Because late effects may  take 10 to 
30years or more to become clinically  apparent, it is too early  to conclude on the long -term 
safety of these treatments .  The proposed pediatric study  has been designed to study  
brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed or refractory  HL, where adult data in this 
disease setting are presently  available and where an unmet medical need for new treatments
currently exists.
[IP_ADDRESS]   Anaplastic Large -Cell Lymphoma
Anaplastic large -cell lymphoma (ALCL) accounts for approximately  10% of all childhood 
non-Hodgkin's l ymphomas.  ALCL can occur at any  age, even in infants, and incidence 
increases steadil y with age .  The incidence of non-Hodgkin ly mphoma ( NHL)in the 
pediatric population is much lower than in adults .  The overall rate in pediatric patients is 
approximately  0.7 per 100,000.(29)  The number of cases with NHL in patients 0 to 4years of 
age across European regions was very  low and casesin pediatric patients less than 2 to 
3years of age are extremely  rare.  Patients may  present with isolated ly mphadenopathy  or 
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  [ADDRESS_577596], soft tissues, lung, liver, 
and/or bone .  Systemic ALCL (sALCL) behaves similarly  to other diffuse large -cell 
lymphomas and is aggressive but potentially  curable with sy stemic combination 
chemotherap y.(30, 31)
Approximately  50%to 80% of pediatric ALCLcases are associated with a t(2;5)(p23;q35) 
chromosome translocation pr ompting the anaplastic ly mphoma kinase (ALK) gene on 
chromosome 2 to fuse with the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5 (ALK 
positivity ).  NPM/ALK fusion protein acts as a constitutively  activated t yrosine kinase .(32, 33)  
Inappropriate expression and activation of the fusion kinase in the ly mphoid compartment 
causes the pathogenesis of some forms of ALCL,(34, 35, 36, 37)however, some lymphomas 
positive for ALK lack this translocation .  In these lymphomas, other chromosomal 
rearrangements, such as inv 2 (p23;q35) and t(1;2)(q25;p23), result in ALK expression .(32, 33)  
In general, ALK -positive sAL CL has a superior OSand failure -free survival rate compared 
with ALK-negative sALCL .(38)  ALK positivity  is the most impor tant prognostic indicator in 
adult ALCL but is less helpful in childhood s ALCL where 80% to 95% of sALCL is ALK 
positive, which precludes comparison of treatment results between pediatric and adult 
studies.
Prognostic factors are crucial for selecting an a ppropriate treatment strategy .  Prognosis in 
children and adults is determined b y staging.  Younger age, absence of B symptoms, 
absence of extranodal disease, and good performance status predict a better prognosis .  
Three main clinical factors are associated with an increased risk of failure in childhood 
sALCL:mediastinal involvement, visceral involvement, and skin lesions.(39, 40, 41, 42, 43)  The 
presence of 1 or more of these has been associated with a poor prognosis: 5-year 
progression- free survival (PFS) ranging from 90 to 61% .  Recent studies have associated 
poor prognosis with the presence of minimal disseminated residual disease and a low titerof 
antibodies to the anaplasti c lymphoma kinase (ALK) at diagnosis .  Patients lacking the 
t(2;5) translocation in their tumor cells (ALK -negative AL CL) typi[INVESTIGATOR_452936] a 5 -year survival of approximately  40%, whereas ALK -positive disease 
has a more favorable pr ognosis with 5- year survival as high as 80 to 90%.(39, 40, 41, 42, 43)
In pediatric frontline sALCL, current therapeutic approaches emplo y combination 
chemotherap y.  Significant hema tological toxicity  has been observed.  Improvements in 
first-line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_452937], pediatric patients presenting with 
sALCL have an excellent prognosis.  Event-free-survival (EFS) in pediatric patients 
suffering from s ALCLis up to 100% for earl y stage and 70% in advanced stage .  OShas 
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  2011 -001240-29
Confidential 27been reported to be up to 90% for ea rly stage, and 80% for advanced stage.  Recent trials 
from the Pediatric Oncology  Group, the Children’s Cancer Group, and European 
cooperative groups have shown disease -free survival for advanced -stage disease in the range 
of 50%to 80% using chemotherapeutic regimens vary ing in duration and intensity .(39, 41, 44, 
45)
Nonetheless, 25 %to 35% of patients develop recurrent disease .(41)  For recurrent or 
refractory  sALCL, 40% to 60% of patients can achieve long -term survival .  There is no 
standard treatment approach; chemotherap y, ASCT, and alloSCT haveall been employ ed in 
this setting .  Several studies suggest that alloSCTmay result in better outcomes for 
refractory /relapsed sALCL.  The treatment of relapsed sALCL is still a matter of debate .  
Induction therap y followed by [CONTACT_5019] -dose chemotherap y and autologous allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant after a second complete remission (CR) is the standard 
treatment for relapsed l ymphoma in children and is currentl y used by [CONTACT_452962] -
line treatment for relapsed sALCL.  Vinblastine is acti ve as a single agent in 
recurrent/refractory  sALCL, in 1study inducing CR in 25 of 30 evaluable patients (83%) 
with acceptable toxicity .  Nine of the 25 patients experiencing a CR with vinblastine 
monotherap y remained in CR with median follow- up of 7years since the end of 
treatment .(42)
The choice of salvage therap y for sALCL patients in first relapse is largely  driven by  
[CONTACT_452963] -line therapy .  
AlloSCTis effective and has acceptable toxicity  as rescue therap y for high-risk sALCL
relapse.  It even offers a cure for patients who are refractory  to chemotherapy , suggesting a 
graft-versus-ALCL effect .  The Berlin -Frankfurt -Münster group reported outcomes for 
20children and adolescents with high -risk relapsed or refractory  sALCLwho underwent 
alloSCT.  Nine patients received alloSCTafter their first relapse and 11 patients were 
transplanted after multiple relapses.  Event -free survi val at 3years after allo geneic transplant
was 75%10%.  There was no influence of donor ty pe or conditioning regimen on outcome .

In our proposed stud y, patients with very  high risk disease, particularl y those who progress 
while receiving standard therap y and are eligible for bone marrow transplantation ( BMT), 
may use brentuximab vedotin to bridge to alloSCT .  This population constitutes ~50 to 60% 
of the high -risk relapsed patients.  Patients who respond to 2 cycles or more of brentuximab

[IP_ADDRESS]   Primary Mediastinal B -Cell Lymphoma
In addition to sAL CL, primary mediastinal B -cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a CD30- positive 
(CD30+)expressing malignancy .  PMBCL is a pathological and clinical subty pe of NHL 
derived from mature th ymic B cells .  In children, PBM CL comprises 1.8% and 3.8% of 
patients registered on the Berlin –Frankfurt –Munster (BFM) and the 
French-American -British (FAB) LMB96 B -cell NHL studies, respectively .  PMBCL hasthe 
poorest survivals in the pediatric age range, but one of the best among adu lts with large 
B-cell lymphomas.  PMBCL are consistentl y positive for CD19, CD20, and CD45 and often 
for CD79a, CD11c, and CD23 .  CD30 is usually  positive while CD10 and CD21 are 
negative.(48, 49, 50, 51, 52)  The BFM group reported 30 PMBCL cases out of 1,650 B -NHL 
pediatric patients, 28 of whom were treated on BFM B -NHL therap y.(53)  From 1984 to 
2003, 116pediatric patients represented <2% of NHL .  The OSrate was 79% and EFS was 
67%, which were significantly  lower than that in other pediatric B -cell lymphomas, such as 
diffuse large B -cell lymphoma or Burkitt’s ly mphoma, and inferi or to the results obtained in 
adult patients with PMLBL who have up to 100% progression- free survival using

1.1.2   Study Drug
Brentuximab vedotinis a CD30- directed antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of 
3components: 1) the antibody  cAC10, specific for human CD30, 2) the highl y potent 
antimicrotubule agent monomethy l auristatin E (MMAE), and 3) a protease -cleavable linker 
that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10 .  The biological act ivity of brentuximab vedotin 
results from a multistep process.  Binding of the ADC to CD30 on the cell surface initi ates 
internalization of the ADC -CD30 complex, which then traffics to the l ysosomal 
compartment .  Within the cell, a single defined active species, MMAE, is released via 
proteolytic cleavage .  Binding of MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network with in 
the cell, induces M -phase cell cy cle arrest, and results in apoptotic death of the 
CD30-expressing tumor cell.
1.2   Preclinical Experience
1.2.1   In Vitro Activity of Brentuximab v edotin
The chimeric antibody  (cAC10)has a typi[INVESTIGATOR_452938] 1 subclass 
(Figure1-1) and is designed to deliver the cy totoxic agent specificall y to tumor cells .  
Brentuximab vedotin binds to the cell surface protein CD30, which is expressed at high 
concentrations on tumor ce lls in HL and sALCL.  Target antigen specificit y allows 
preferential delivery  of the drug to tumor cells when drug is conjugated to the antibody  as an 
ADC.

Confidential 30Figure1-1   Schematic Diagram of B rentuximab vedotin
Brentuximab vedotin binds to CD30+ cells (ALCL cell line Karpas 299) at a dissociation 
constant (K D) of approximately  2nM, similar to that of the unconjugated cAC10 anti -CD30 
antibody.  Cell surface and intracellular localization of brentuximab vedotin was 
demonstrated b y fluorescence micros copy after binding to CD30+ cells (HL cell line 
L540cy).  Within 16 hours of incubation at 37 C, brentuximab vedotin was detected inside 
cells and co-localized with intracellular l ysosomes indicating internalization and trafficking 
to lysosomes.  Monomethy l auristatin E (MMAE) was released from brentuximab vedotin
intracellularl y by [CONTACT_398]30+ human HL (L540cy  and L428) and ALCL (Karpas 299) cell lines 
as determined b y liquid chromatography  with tandem mass spectrom etryanalysis of cell 
culture medium .  In addition, studies demonstrating release of MMAE from brentuximab 
vedotinby [CONTACT_452965] B and l ysosome-enriched tumor cell extracts were performed 
supporting the concept of release of MMAE via the conditionally  labile linker ( Figure1-1).  
Free MMAE inhibited microtubule poly merization in vitr o and tumor cells (CD30+
embryonal carcinoma Tera -2 cells) treated with MMAE or brentuximab vedotin displayed a 
rounded morphology  and disrupted micotubule network.
The primary  pharmacod ynamic effect of brentuximab vedotin was to induce cell cy cle arrest 
in the G2/M phase of the cell cy cle.  An increase in the percent of cells in G2/M phase was 
observed over t ime in cultures of CD30+ cells (HL cell line L 540cy and ALCL  cell line 
Karpas 299) treated with brentuximab vedotin .  Brentuximab vedotin selectively killed 
CD30+HL and ALCL cell lines (I C50 of 0.089 and 0.031 nM, respectivel y), but not 
CD30-negative cells (WSU -NHL) at concentrat ions of approximately  100-fold higher .

1.3   Clinical Experience
The safety and efficacy  of brentuximab vedotin has been evaluated in more than 
300patients with H L, sALCL, and other CD30+ hematologic malignancies in [ADDRESS_577601] been collected from 2completed phase1 dose escalation studies 
(SG035-0001 and SG035- 0002), a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] [ADDRESS_577602] (SG 035-0003),a pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 2 study in relapsed or refractory  sALCL 
(SG035-0004) , and a phase 1,drug-drug interaction study  (SG035-008A).  Preliminary  and 
final anal yses of safet y data indicate that brentuximab vedotin has a tolerable and 
manageable safety profile in the studied populations .
In StudySG035-0001, a total of 45 patients with CD30+ hematologic malignancies (42 with 
HL, 2 with sAL CL, 1 with angioimmunoblastic T -cell lymphoma) were treated with 
brentuximab vedotin at doselevelsof 0.1 to 3.6mg /kg administered intravenously (IV) 
every 3 weeks.  The primary  objectives of the study  were to establish a maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) of brentuximab vedotin and to assess the associated toxicity  profile.  The most 
common adverse events were fatigue (36%), pyrexia(33%), and diarrhea, nausea , peripheral 
neuropath y, and neutropenia (22% each) .  Notable serious adverse events considered at least 
possibly related to treatment included anaphy laxis, myocardial infarction, and peripheral 
neuropath y.

5with sALCL, and 1with peripheral T -cell lymphoma) were treated with brentuximab 
vedotinat doselevelsof 0.4 to 1.4 mg/kg administered IVweekly for 3 of 4 weeks.  The 
primary objectives explored in this study  were to establish the safet y profile and MTD of 
weekly brentuximab vedotin monotherapy  in patients with relapsed or refractory  CD30+ 
hematologic malignancies.  Although this weekl y regimen was designed to enable 
combination use with gemcitabine, efficacy  with brentuximab vedotin monotherap y was 
deemed sufficient and the planned brentuximab vedotin /gemcitabine combination was not 
pursued.  The most common adverse event s were peripheral sensory  neuropathy  (66%); 
fatigue (52%); nausea (50%); diarrhea (32%); arthralgia (27%); py rexia (25%); and 
decreased appetite, my algia, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_2826] (23% each) .  Treatment 
discontinuations due to adverse event s were observed in 30% of patients .  The most frequent 
AE that le d to dose modification or delay  was peripheral sensory  neuropathy .  Acute 
infusion reaction AEs occurred in a total of 6 patients.  Overall, these acute infusion reaction 
AEs were reported as less than Grade 2 in severity  and resolved .  Overall, 2 patients(14%) 
who had an acute infusion reaction also had antithe rapeutic antibodies at any  postbaseline 
visit.

27weeks (9cycles) and 20 weeks (6 cycles), respectively.  Most p atients (89%) in the two 
phase2 studies were between the ages of 18 and 65 years.  The primary endpoint of both 
studies was overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by [CONTACT_452966] .  
Key secondary endpoints included duration of response, OS, and PFS .  The key efficacy 
results in HL  (SG035-0003) include ORR per IRF (75% [95%CI:  64.9-82.6%]), CR rate
(34% [95%CI:  25.2-44.6%]), B symptom resolution rate (77%), and duration of response 
(DOR, 29weeks).  Key efficacy points in s ALCL (SG035-0004) include ORR (86% [95% 
CI:  74.6-93.9%]), CR rate (53% [95% CI:  39.6-66.7%]), and B symptom resolution rate 
(82%).
Treatment -emergent AEs occurring in ≥20% of patients in phase 2 were peripheral sensory  
neuropath y (44%), fatigue (42%), nausea (41%), diarrhea (34%), p yrexia (31%), upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2826] (28%), neutropenia (21%), and vomiting (20%) .  These events 
were primar ily mild to moderate in severity and reversible .  Approximately  half of patients

Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  [ADDRESS_577603].  Dose delay  and subsequent 
reduction to 1.2 mg/kg was generally effective in managing peripheral neuropathy .  Grade3 
and Grade4 neutropenia occurred in 13% and 7% of patients, respectivel y; these events 
weretypi[INVESTIGATOR_452939] s with growth factor 
support in some cases.  Infusion-related reactions occurred in approximately 10% of patients 
and were ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_452940] b y dose delay or reduction .  Infusion-related reaction
prophylaxis in subsequent treatment cy cles was instituted at the discretion of the 
investigator .  The clinical laboratory  parameters for which the most patients had new or 
worsening shifts to Grade3 were low neutrophils (11%), l ymphocytes (11%), platelets 
(6%), leukocy tes (5%), and high glucose (6%) .  Only 1patient in the phase 2 studies had 
Grade3 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST).
In the phase 2 studies, 31% of patients had a serious adverse event , 28% had an SAE of 
Grade3 or higher, and 15% had an SAE that was determine d by [CONTACT_452967].  The most common SAE preferred terms (2%) were 
abdominal pain, disease progression (recurrent sALCL), pulmonary  embolism, and septic 
shock.  A higher proportion of sALCLpatients experienced SAEs, including deaths within 
30days of last dose, relative to patients with HL, likely due to the older age and more 
aggressive nature of the malignancy in this patient population.
A total of 9 deaths were reported within the safety  evaluation period (within 30days of the 
last dose of brentuximab vedotin ) in 357patients across the 6 phase 1 and phase 2 studies 
for which data are available.  Two patient deaths (0.6%) were considered related to study  
treatment .  One patient in S tudySG035-0001 who received 3.6 mg/kg in phase 1 died due to 
febrile neutropenia and presumed septic shock .  A second treatment -related death in 
StudySG035-008A was attributed to pancytopenia, cy tomegalovirus ( CMV)infection, and 
intracranial hemorrhage .  The remaining on -study deaths were primaril y related to disease 
progression in patients with sALCL.
Four pediatric patients (aged 14 -17years) were included in S tudySG035-0004 in sALCL, 
and 1pediatric patient ( aged 15years) was included in S tudySG035-[ADDRESS_577604] 1 event of peripheral neuropath y, ranging from 
Grade1 to Grade3, and 2patients reported events of neutropenia .  One patient experienced 
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  2011 -001240-29
Confidential 35treatment -related G rade3 neutropenia, and 1 patient experienced G rade3 andGrade4 
neutropenia and Grade3 and Grade4 thrombocy topenia that were assessed as not related to 
brentuximab vedotin .  This same patient experienced an SAE of Grade2 viral 
gastroenteritis, which was unrelated to study  drug.  The patient with HL in S tudySG035-
003 achieved a CR and completed treatment .  The patient’s DOR was 50.4 weeks.  Three of 
the 4pediatric patients with sAL CL in StudySG035-004achieved CR and 1 achieved 
partial remission ( PR); 1patient was transitioned to ASCT.
Brentuximab vedotin has been shown to induce durable remissions in patients with HL  both 
pre-and post-ASCT, and in patients with relapsed or refractory  sALCL.  Progression -free 
survivalresults comparing PFS with brentuximab vedotinto PFS from prior sy stemic 
therapy indicate that PFS is significantl y prolonged with brentuximab vedotinfor both HL  
and sALCL.  A substantial number of patients with HL  and sALCLand B symptoms at 
baseline saw these s ymptoms resolve during treatment with brentuximab vedotin .  In 
addition, the la rge majority  of patients with sALCL presenting with cutaneous lesions at 
baseline experienced resolution of these sy mptoms after receiving brentuximab vedotin .
Further details on clinical studies with brentuximab vedotin are provided in the brentuximab 
vedotinIB.
1.3.[ADDRESS_577605] patients diagnosed with HL  or sALCLrespond to initial chemotherapy .  However, 
20%to 40% of these patients will eventually  relapse, and approximately  10% of patients 
will have refractory  disease.  Salvagechemotherapeutic regimens and ASCT are secondary  
options for these patients, but both are associated with a significant morbidity  rate.  
Immunotherap y with an ADC represents an additional therapeutic modality with the 
potential to maintain or improve effi cacy without concomitant increase in toxicity .
Brentuximab vedotin is a novel ADC directed against the CD30 surface antigen expressed 
on hematologic malignancies including HL and sALCLtumor cells.  Preclinical studies of 
brentuximab vedotin demonstrated a ntitumor activity  in both in vitro and in vivo models.  
This study  is the first clinical use of brentuximab vedotin exclusively  in pediatric patients 
with relapsed or refractory CD30+ malignancies, the majority  of which are expected to be 
HL and sALCL.  The safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicit y, and antitumor 
activity of brentuximab vedotin will be evaluated in eligible patients.
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  2011 -001240-29
Confidential 36As the goal of phase1 of thisstudy is to establish safet y and define the MTD and/or 
recommended phase 2 doseof brentuximab vedotin in pediatric hematological malignancies 
with high expression of CD30, patients with relapsed or refractory  CD30+ malignancies 
(including HL and sALCL) are planned for inclusion in the phase 1 study population .
The phase2 portion of the study  will enroll patients into 2 separate arms based on diagnosis 
ofrelapsedor refractory  sALCL,or relapsed or refractory  HL; patients will receive 
brentuximab vedotin at the MTD and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)determined in 
the phase [ADDRESS_577606] overall response rate (CR +PR) and DORwill be 
evaluated.

1.4   Potential Risk s and Benefits
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, good clinical practice (GCP), 
applicable regulatory requirements, and International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) 
guidelines.
1.4.1   Benefit Analysis in Hodgkin Lymphoma
StudySG035-0003, a phase2 studyof brentuximab vedotin evaluated 1.8 mg/kg 
administered IVevery 3weeks in a relativel y homogeneous population of [ADDRESS_577608].
A 75% ORR (representing the predefined primary  endpoint of the trial) with a durability  of 
6.7months was observed .  A substantial proportion (34%) of all treated patients obtained a 
complete remission as manifested b y no evidence of ly mphoma by  [CONTACT_2085], laboratory , or 
radiographic measures .  Observed CRs were durable, with the median duration not reached 
and a lower 95% confidence interval bound of 8.[ADDRESS_577609] , and this 
potentially  curative treatment option was enabled in a meaningful fraction of patients with 
HL treated in the study .

recently delivered treatment .  Analysis of transplant -ineligible patients in phase 1 studies 
demonstrated clinical benefit in the pretransplant setting.
1.4.2   Benefit Analysis in Systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
StudySG035-0004, a phase 2 study of brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg administered IV
every 3weeks in 58patients 12 years of age or older with sAL CL, an ORR of 86% was
observed and 53% of patients obtained a CRas manifested by [CONTACT_452968] b y 
clinical, laboratory , or radiographic measures.  The ability  to attain a second CRor achieve a 
first CRafter the failure of frontline therap y enables an improved opportunity for SCT, an 
exploratory  yet potentially  curativetreatment.
As for HL, an intrapatient comparison of PFS per investigator assessment obtained with 
brentuximab vedotin versus the most recent prior therap y was conducted.  In 90% of cases , 
the most recent prior therapy  was multiagent chemotherapy , delivered with or without 
ASCT.  The median PFS duration achieved with brentuximab vedotin was approximately  
[ADDRESS_577611] recent prior therap y.
1.4.3   Potential Risks in C hildren
The recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin in a dult patients is 1.8 mg/kg administered 
IVevery 3weeks as long as the patient continues to benefit from and tolerates therapy .  At 
this dose and schedule, the most common adverse events were peripheral sensory  
neuropath y, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, p yrexia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_2826], neutropenia, 
and vomiting .  These events have been primarily  mild ormoderate in severity .
The most notable adverse event associated with brentuximab vedotin is peripheral 
neuropath ythat tends to increase in severity with longer duration of therapy, consistent with 
thatobserved with other antimicrotubule agents such as vinca alky loids or taxanes.  S ensory 
events were more common than motor events, and the peripheral neuropathy  (PN)events 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_96448] a distal to proximal pattern of development, also similar to the PN seen 
with other tubulin disruptors.  
Approximately  half of patients in the phase 2 studies 
experienced treatment -emergent PN, which was primarily  mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 
Grade2).  The most fr equently occurring events were peripheral sensory  neuropathy  (44%), 
peripheral motor neuropathy  (9%),and paresthesia (4%) .  Grade3 peripheral neuropathy  
events occurred in 18 (11%) patients .  No Grade 4 PN events were reported.
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  [ADDRESS_577612] 1 PN Standardis ed MedDRA Query  
(SMQ) event, the median time to onset of any  PN SMQ event was 12.4 weeks.  For
≥Grade3 events, there was a clear trend toward first onset in later cy cles, with the majority  
of events having first onset between C ycles9 and 16.  Overall, 15% of patients had dose 
modifications for PN SMQ events .  Dose delay s for PN SMQ events occurred in 20 patients 
(13%) and dose reductions occurred in 12 patients (8%) .  Treatment discontinuations for PN 
SMQ events occurred in 14 patients (9%) .  Neuropathy  was generall y reversible, with a 
median time from onset to resolution or improvement of 6.6 weeks (range, 0.3 to 
54.4weeks).
The majority  of peripheral neuropathy  events were Grade1 or Grade 2 and were 
manageable by [CONTACT_452969].  For new or worsening events of Grade 2 or 
Grade3 neuropathy , dosing should be held until neuropathy  improves to ≤Grade1 and then 
restarted at the 1.2mg/kgdoselevel.  For Grade 4 (life-threatening )peripheral neuropathy , 
brentuximab vedotin should be discontinued .
Infusion-related reactions (I RRs) are possible with brentuximab vedotin, especially  related 
to the development of clinically  significant titers of antitherapeutic antibodies (ATAs ).  
Patients must be monitored fo r the possibility  of an acute reaction during brentuximab 
vedotin administration.  If IRR symptoms develop, the infusion should be interrupted and 
appropriate medical management instituted.  Further information on the management of 
IRRs is provided in Sect ion6.1.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopat hy (PML)has beenreported with brentuximab 
vedotinuse.  PML is a rare demyelinating disease of the brain that is caused by  [CONTACT_452970] (JCV). It typi[INVESTIGATOR_452941]. Presenting features may  include altered mental status, motor deficits such as 
hemiparesis or ataxia, visual disturbances, or higher cortical d ysfunction such as dy sphasia 
or agnosia. Seizures have also been reported in PML  patients (approximately  20%). The 
onset of neurological deficits may  occur over weeks to months.(60)  Cognitive decline 
without accompan ying deficits in motor or sensory  function is uncommon.  Optic nerve 
involvement, fever, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_452942] P ML. In 
addition, peripheral neuropathy , which has been reported with brentuximab vedotin 
treatment, is not commonly  reported with PML . If PML is suspected, a diagnostic work -up 
should be performed , as described in Section 6.8.2.
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  2011 -001240-29
Confidential 39Stevens-Johnson sy ndrome (SJS) , including toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_23936],has been reported in 
patients who received brentuximab vedotin.  P atients were concurrently receiving other 
medications (naproxen and tramadol, respectively) that areknown to cause SJS and may 
have contributed to the development of SJS. Stevens-Johnson sy ndromeis considered to be 
an unacceptable stud y drug-related toxicity .  If SJS occurs, the administration of 
brentuximab vedotin must be discontinued and the approp riate medical therapy  
administered.  
Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients treated with brentuximab vedotin and has 
contributed to fatal outcomes in some cases.  Onset ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_452943] 1 to 2 doses of 
brentuximab vedotin.  Early  symptoms included severe abdominal pain, nausea, and 
vomiting.  Some of the pancreatitis cases were complicated by  [CONTACT_452971], including cholelithiasis and alternate etiologies (eg, pancreatic ly mphoma 
progression, displacement of bile du ct stent).
Concomitant use of brentuximab vedotin and bleomy cin is contraindicated due to pulmonary  
toxicity. In a clinical trial that studied brentuximab vedotin with bleomy cin as part of a
combination regimen, the rate of noninfectious pulmonary  toxicity was higher than the 
historical incidence reported with ABVD ( adriamycin, bleomy cin, vinblastine, dacarbazine).
Patients ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_452944] d yspnea.Interstitial infiltration and/or inflammation 
were observed on radiographs and computed tomogr aphic imaging of the chest. Most 
patients responded to corticosteroids.
Hepatotoxicity , predominately  in the form of as ymptomatic mild to moderate transient 
elevations in AST and/or AL T, has been reported inpatients treated with brentuximab 
vedotin.  Patients should be monitored for elevated liver enzy mes.
Preliminary  population PK anal yses of the effects of brentuximab vedotin on renal and 
hepatic function suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary  for patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment.  Additional analy sis is planned to more fully  characterize the 
pharmacokinetics in this patient population.   
The effects of brentuximab vedotin on embry ogenesis, reproduction, and spermatogenesis in 
humans are unknown.  In addition, data about the effects of b rentuximab vedotin in pregnant 
women are unavailable .  Patients of childbearing potential are advised to use adequate and 
effective contraception during brentuximab vedotin treatment and for a 6-monthperiod 
thereafter.

Confidential 41Organization ( WHO)international growth charts for children aged 24 months (available at 
cdc.gov/growthcharts) and CDC growth charts in persons aged 2 to 19 years will be used.  
Clinical charts are available for boy s and for girls at 
cdc.gov/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm .  A sexual maturity  scale such as the one 
developed b y Tanner is used to assess the ph ysical developmental stage of a patient .  This 
scale assigns a Tanne r stage of 1 (prepubertal) to 5 (adult) to girls based on breasts and 
pubic hair and to bo ys based on genitalia and pubic hair.
The multiagent chemotherap y regimens often employed as salvage therap y in patients with 
relapsed or refractory  HL or sAL CL carrysignificant toxicities .  Given the benefit observed 
with brentuximab vedotin monotherap y in thispopulation with aggressive disease, the 
manageable adverse event profile is notable.

pharmacokinetics ,determine thepediatricMTDand/or RP2Dof brentuximab vedotin in 
pediatric patients , andevaluatethe antitumor activity  of brentuximab vedotin in eligible 
patients.
Approximately 42evaluable patients will be enrolled in this study .  In the phase 1 portion of 
the study, at least12patients with relapsed or refractory  CD30+ malignancies (including HL 
and sALCL) will be enrolled in 2 planned dose cohorts (3 to 6 patients per cohort) according 
to the standard 3 +3 dose escalation scheme .
Once the MTD and/or RP2D havebeen reached, patients will be enrolled by [CONTACT_452972] 2 study arms: relapsedor refractory  sALCL,or relapsedor refractory  HL.  A 
sufficient number of patients will be enrolled in the phase2 portion of the study to have at 
least 15evaluable patients with sAL CL (including patients treated at the RP2D during 
phase1), of whom at least 10patients are in first relapse, and at least 15evaluable patients 
with HL (including patients treated at RP2D during phase 1).
Brentuximab vedotin will be administered b y IVinfusion once every  21days.  Each 21-day 
treatment cy cle is composed of 1 day of study drug treatment, followed b y a monitoring
period of 20 days.  The starting dose in phase 1 will be 1.4mg/kg ,and escalation will 
proceed using a traditional 3 +3 design to a maximum dose of 1.8 mg/kg.
Overall response will be evaluated beginning after 2cycles of therapy .  Objective response 
over the course of the study  willbe assessed b y an IRFaccording to the IWGRevised 
Response Criteria for Malignant Ly mphoma.(1)  Patients, including those who achieve a CR, 
a PR, or stable disease ( SD), may receive brentuximab vedotin for up to 16cycles.  
Treatment with brentuximab vedotin beyond 16cyclesmay be permitted at the joint 
discretion of the spons or andthe investigator for those patients experiencing continued 
clinical benefit .  Following administration of the final dose of brentuximab vedotin , patients
will be monitored for adverse events for a minimum of 30days.  Patients will be followed 
for PFS and OSevery [ADDRESS_577613] patient.   Patients whoremain on treatme nt 
after Cycle16 will be followed according to the above schedule or until study  closure.

6.   STUDY DRUG
6.1   Study Drug Administration
Study drug will be administered only  to eligible patients under the supervision of the 
investigator or identified subinvestigator(s).
Infusion-related reactions may  occur during the infusion of brentuxi mab vedotin.  The 
infusion should be administered at a site properl y equipped and staffed to manage 
anaphylaxis should it occur.  The patient should be observed for [ADDRESS_577625] 1hour to allow 
administration of IV drugs if necessary.  All supportive measures consistent with optimal 
patient care will be given throughout the stud y according to institution alstandards. 
Medications for infusion- related reactions, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamines, and 
corticosteroids, should be available for immediate use.
Patients who experience a Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion -related reaction may receive 
subsequent brentuximab infusions with premedication consisting of acetaminophen (650 mg 
orally) and diphenhy dramine (25 –50 mg orally  or 10–25 mg IV) or according to institutional 
standards, administered 30 to 60minutes prior to each 30-minute brentuximab vedotin 
infusion. Premedication may  include acetaminop hen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid.
If a Grade3 or greater infusion-related reaction consistent with anaphy laxis occurs, 
immediately  and permanently  discontinue administration of brentuximab vedotin and 
administer appropriate medical therap yper institutional guidelines.

administered through a dedicated IV line and cannot be mixed with other medications.
In the phase 1portion of the stu dy, the starting dose will be 1.4 mg/kg and escalation will 
proceed using a traditional 3 +3 design to a maximum dose of 1.8 mg/kg.  Dosing is based 
on patients’ weight according to the institutional standard; however, doses will be adjusted 
for patients who experience a ≥ 10% change in weight from the most recent dose 
calculation .  Actual weight will be used except for patients weighing greater than 100 kg; 
dose will be calculated based on [ADDRESS_577627] whole number of milligrams.
The dose for the phase 2 portion of the study will be the MTD and/or RP2D , as determined 
duringphase1.  Each 21-day treatment cy cle is composed of [ADDRESS_577628] discontinue brentuximab vedotin prior to initiating a conditioning regimen; 
these patients will be followed for survival anal yses until study closure.  Following 
administration of the final dose of brentuximab vedotin , patients will be followed for safety 
for a minimum of 30 days.
6.2   Definitions of Dose -Limiting Toxicity
Toxicity will be evaluated according to the National Cancer InstituteCommon Terminology  
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE)version4.03, effective 14 June2010.(64)  These 
criteria are provided in the Study  Manual.  DLT will be defined as discussed in 
Sections6.2.2and 6.2.3.
6.2.[ADDRESS_577629] clinician will discuss and document the overall toxicity profile 
in detail before deciding whether to initiate cohort expansion, dose escalation, dose 
modification,and/or future proph ylaxis with colony -stimulating factors (CSFs) .

Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  2011 -001240-29
Confidential 536.2.2   Nonhematologic Toxicity
For nonhematologic toxicities, DL T will be defined as any  CTCAE v. 4.03 Grade3 or 
greater toxicity except for:
Grade3 fatigue
Grade3 or 4 nausea and vomiting lasting less than 24 hours
Grade3 nonhematologic laboratory  abnormalities that resolve to Grade 1 or 
baseline (if the patient entered the stud y with existing toxicity ) within 14 days
6.2.3   Hematologic Toxicity
DLT for hematologic toxicity  will be def ined as:
Grade4 neutropenia lasting long er than 7days
Grade3 febrile neutropenia requiring antibiotics
Grade4 febrile neutropenia
Grade4 platelet count (<25,000/ µL) at any time
6.2.4   Phase1: Dose Modification for an Individual P atient Who Experiences DLT
Any patient experiencing DL T lasting 14 days or longer will be discontinued from the study.  
Dose modification for further treatments with brentuximab vedotin will only occur for 
individual patients who experience a protocol defined DLT of less than 14 days’duration, 
yet whom the site investigator and project clinician believe can safely  receive additional 
treatment .  Subsequent doses should be decr eased to the previous dose levelor to 0.9mg/kg 
for patients in the 1.4 -mg/kg cohort .
The DLT experience d by [CONTACT_452974]1 or baseline 
at the time of the next scheduled dose .  If toxicity  does not return to less than or equal to 
Grade1 or baseline within 14 days, the patient should be taken off stud y; every effort should 
be made to ensure thatearly termination procedures are followed.

Confidential 546.2.5   Phase1: Dose Elimination/Holding/Reduction for Patients Who Have Not 
Experienced a DLT
A scheduled dose of brentuximab vedotin may be held up to [ADDRESS_577630] not y et recovered from an adverse event (AE) before the 
next scheduled dose administration .  For patients withAEs that have returnedto baseline or 
Grade1 values, a held dose may  be administered up to [ADDRESS_577631] Grade 1.  If the dose is eliminated, and/or the tox icities have not re solved within 
14days,the patient should be taken off study ; every effort should be made to ensure that 
early termination procedures are followed.
6.2.6   Maximum Tolerated Dos e or Recommended Phase 2 Dose
ThepediatricMTD and/or RP2D will be the highest dose at which no more than [ADDRESS_577632] treatment cy cle.  The MTD 
and/or RP2D will be established without the use of colony stimulating factors ( CSFs)in 
Cycle 1.
6.3   Dose Escalation Rules
The dose intervals will follow the 3+3 traditional escalation rules, starting with the 
treatment of 3 patients at the 1.4-mg/kgdose:
If 0 of 3patients experiences DLT, dose escalation will proceed to the 1.8 -mg/kg 
dose at which 3 patients will be enrolled.
If 1 of 3patients experiences DLT, 3 additional patients will be enrolled at the 
1.4-mg/kg dose level.
If no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences DLT, escalation will continue to the 
1.8-mg/kg dose level.
If 0 or 1patient experiences DLT, 3additional patients will be enro lled at the 
1.8mg/kg dose level.
If 2or more patients in either dose level experience DLT, dosing will s top, and the 
previous dose levelwill be considered the MTD.

are all permissible following discussions between the sponsor and the investigators, if such measures are 
needed for patient safety or for a better understanding of the dose -related toxicity, exposure, or 
pharmacodynamics of brentuximab vedotin .
The starting dose of brentuximab vedotin will be approximately  80% of the adult MTD, 
equal to 1.4 mg/kg, given on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.  Patients not receiving all doses of

6.4   Phase2Dose-Modification Guidelines
6.4.1   Criteria for Dose Modification*
The start of the next cy cle may be delayed for up to [ADDRESS_577633] 1 dose level (or 
to 0.9mg/kgif the patient is receiving the 1.4- mg/kgdose) if the patient has any  of the 
following:
Brentuximab vedotin- related toxicity  that results in a delay  of more than 14 daysin 
the start of a subsequent cy cle of treatment because of lack of recovery  to the 
specified re -treatment criteria
Grade4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count 25,000/µL ) lasting more than 
7consecutive day s.
Grade3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity attributed to brentuximab vedotin except 
for the following , whichdo not require dose reduction:
oGrade3 or greaternausea and/or emesis in the absence of optimal anti- emetic 
prophylaxis(Optimal anti emetic prophylaxis is defined as an anti emetic 
regimen that emplo ys both a 5-HT3 antagonist and a corticosteroid given in 
standard doses and according to standard schedules.)

Confidential 57oGrade3 or greaterdiarrhea that occurs in the absence of optimal supportive 
therapy
oGrade3 fatigue
Brentuximab vedotin- related neuropathy  should be ma naged with a combination of dose 
delay and reduction to 1.2mg/kg(or to 0.9mg/kgif the patient is receiving the 1.4-mg/kg
dose).  For new or worsening Grade 2 or 3 neuropathy , dosing should be held for up to
21days until neuropathy  improves to ≤Grade1 and then restarted at 1.2mg/kg(or to 
0.9mg/kgif the patient is receiving the 1.4-mg/kgdose).  For Grade 4 peripheral 
neuropath y, brentuximab vedotin should be discontinued.
When a dose reduction of brentuximab vedotin is required, no re -escalation of dose will be 
permitted.*
6.4.[ADDRESS_577634] meet the following criteri a:
ANC must be ≥1,000/ µL
Platelet count must be ≥75,000/ µL
For therap y to resume, toxicity  considered to be related to treatment with 
brentuximab vedotin must have resolved to Grade1, to the patient’s baseline 
values, or to a level considered acceptable b y the physician (eg, hy pophosphatemia 
that can be managed b y oral replacement) .
For the phase [ADDRESS_577635] been met.  Should the start of the next cy cle during phase 1 need to be 
delayed for more than 14daysbecause of incomplete recovery  from treatment-related 
toxicity, this will be considered a DLT and the patient should be discontinued from study .  If

to understand the brentuximab vedotin safety profile.
All concomitant medications collected from screening through the stud y period will be 
classified to preferred terms according to the World Health Organization (WHO) drug 
dictionary .
Additional safet y analyses may be performed to most clearl y enumerate rates of toxicities 
and to further define the safet y profile of brentuximab vedotin .

Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  2011 -001240-29
Confidential 779.1.2   Adverse Event Definition
Adverse event (AE) means any  untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), sy mptom, or 
disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether 
or not it is related to the medicinal product .  This includes any  newly occurring event, or a 
previous condition that has increased in severity  or frequency  since the administration of 
study drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE u nless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay  in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is 
considered b y the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline .
9.1.3   Serious Adverse Event Definition
Serious AE (SAE) me ans any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event .  It does not refer to an event which hypotheticall y might have 
caused death if it were more severe).
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]
(see clarification in the following paragraph on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]).
Results in persistent or significant dis ability or incapacity.  (Disability  is defined 
as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event .  This refers to an AE that may  not result in death, 
beimmediately  life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may  be considered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may  jeopardize the patient, 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_577657] of an infectious agent .  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
Brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35)
Clinical Study Protocol C25002 Amendment 4, EudraCT:  2011 -001240-29
Confidential 78treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse; an y organism, virus, or infectious particle (eg, prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopath y), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious age nt.
In this stud y, intensity for each AE, including an y lab abnormality , will be determined using 
the NCI CTCAE version4.03,effective 14 June2010.(64)  Clarification should be made 
between a nSAE and an AE that is considered to be severe (Grade 3or 4), because the terms 
serious and severe are NOT sy nonymous.  The general term severeis often used to describe 
the intensity  (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively 
minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache).  This is NOT the same as serious , 
which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described previously , and is 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or ability  to function .  A 
severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily  need to be considered serious.  For example, a 
white blood cell count of 1000/ µLto less than 2000/ µLis considered Grade 3 (severe) but 
may not be considered to be an SAE .  Seriousness (not intensity ) serves as a guide for 
defining reg ulatory reporting obligations.
9.2   Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 
AdverseEvents
All AEs spontaneously  reported by  [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question from 
study personnel or revealed by  [CONTACT_4171], phy sical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 9.3for the 
period of observation) .  Any clinically  relevant deterioration in laboratory assessmen ts or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE.  When possible, signs and s ymptoms indicating a 
common underly ing pathology  should be noted as 1 comprehensive event.
Regardless of causalit y,SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Section 9.1) 
must be reported (see Section 9.3for the period of observation) b y the investigator to the 
Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (contact [CONTACT_452979]).  This should be done by [CONTACT_51260] 24hoursafter becoming aware 
of the event .  The SAE Form, created specificall y by [CONTACT_20555], will be provided to each 
clinical study  site.  A sample of the SAE Form may  be found in t he Study Manual.  
Follow-up information on the SAE or serious pretreatment event may  be requested by  
[CONTACT_20555] .  SAE report information must be consistent with the data provided on the 
eCRF.

This amendment seeks to promote patient safet y by [CONTACT_452981]-drug interactions, using an objective definition of dose -limiting toxici ty (DLT), and 
specifying administration equipment that ensures drug compatibility .
Purposes for Amendment1
Exclude those patients receiving strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and institute a [ADDRESS_577685] 
received strong inhibitors of CYP3A4
Prohibit concomitant administration of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 during the 
brentuximab vedotin treatment period
Remove investigator attributions from the definitions of dose- limiting toxicities 
(DLTs)

14.5   Amendment 2 Rationale and Purposes ([LOCATION_009] -Specific Amendment)
Rationale for Am endment 2
One case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  (PML) was reported in a 
48-year-old male patient with Hodgkin l ymphoma (HL) who developed progressive disease 
after undergoing an autologous bone marrow transplant.  He subsequentl y received both 
local radiation therap y and [ADDRESS_577686] 
of 3doses of brentuximab vedotin.  Two months after his initial dose, he presented with 
focal neurologic sy mptoms and was later diagnosed with PML .  As HL and
immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_452958] , it is unclear what role 
brentuximab vedotin play ed in the development of PML , although a contributory  role cannot 
be excluded. Therefore, the protocol now excludes patients with signs or sy mptoms of PML  
and contains instructions for the suggested management of suspected PML that include 
immediate brentuximab vedotin discontinuation.
Purposes for Amendment2
Revise exclusion criteria to exclude patients with signs or s ymptoms of PML
Add instructio ns for the management of suspected PML
Add PML  and John Cunningham virus (JCV) to the L ist of Abbreviations

Confidential 9714.6   Amendment 3 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 3
Events of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  (PML) have been reported in p atients 
who received brentuximab vedotin.  The protocol now excludes patients with signs or 
symptoms of PML  and contains instructions for the suggested management of suspected 
PML that include brentuximab vedotin discontinuation.
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been reported in previous studies with brentuximab 
vedotin.  I nformation has been added on the management of infusion -related reactions, 
including instructions to immediately  and permanently  discontinue administration of 
brentuximab vedotin for Grade3 or higher infusion -related reactions consistent with 
anaphylaxis.
Events of pulmonary  toxicity were reported in a study  with brentuximab vedotin given with 
bleomycin as part of a combination regimen.  The protocol now includes information on the 
occurrence of pulmonary toxicity  and specifies that the concomitant use of bleomy cin with 
brentuximab vedotin is contraindicated.
Peripheral neuropath y has been a frequentl y reported adverse event in previous studies with 
brentuximab vedotin.  Cumulative d osing with brentuximab vedotin has been associated 
with an increased incidence of peripheral neuropathy .  The original protocol states that the 
brentuximab vedotin dose should be held in the case of n ew or worsening events of Grade [ADDRESS_577687] 14 days is required for patients who received local palliative 
radiation therap y; a washout per iod of at least 84 days is required for patients who receive 
radiation therap y to more than 25% of bone marrow-containing spaces.  Exclusion criteria 
have been added to specify  these restrictions on receiving radiation therapy prior to the first 
dose of st udy drug.
Planned imaging assessments have been revised in order to minimize radiation exposure in 
this pediatric population.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed for neck, 
abdomen, and pelvis evaluations; computed tomograph y (CT) scans will be used for chest 
evaluations only .
Patient enrollment was defined as at the time of informed consent in the original version of 
the protocol.  To conform to Millennium protocol standards, the definition of enrollment has 
been changed to at the time of fi rst dose of stud y drug.
The contact [CONTACT_452982] (SAEs) and events of pregn ancy has been 
revised.  Section 14.[ADDRESS_577688]

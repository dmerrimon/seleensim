1.0 Background
The optimum therapy for metastatic  melanoma remains unclear.  In Western  Europe  Dacarbazine alone remains the preferred 
palliative therapy for advanced metastatic melanoma while in  the United  States, the multi-drug combinations such  as CVD 
(Cisplatin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine) or Dartmouth Regimen (including Cisplatin, BCNU, Dacarbazine, Tamoxifen) are the most  
commonly used regimens despi[INVESTIGATOR_769511].(1-
3)   During the past decade several small trials with IL-2-interferon-CVD combination  (biochemotherapy) studies suggested 
improvement in response rate and survival over the results observed  with multi-drug chemotherapy  combinations. (4-7)  To 
determine the impact of addition of biologicals to combination  chemotherapy on  response  rates and patient survival, 3 
prospectively randomized studies  Phase III trials were conducted in  [LOCATION_003].(8-10)   The outcome of these  trials failed  to show 
superiority of efficacy of biochemotherapy over combination chemotherapy in  terms of response  rates and survival. Paclitaxel 
and Docetaxel have been evaluated for efficacy against  metastatic melanoma.   The response rates to these  drugs ranged 
between 13 to 15 % in Chemonaive  patients.  Phase II study of ABI-[ADDRESS_1055997] a response 
rate 20% in similar patient population indicating that it may be  the most effective taxane against metastatic melanoma. 
Multiple Phase II clinical trials with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165], Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769512], IL-[ADDRESS_1055998] durable  complete responses  similar to IL-2. (12-16)   We have been evaluating Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  –
temozolomide combination in patients  with metastatic melanoma without  prior chemotherapy over the past several years.  The 
combination is well tolerated and the toxicity profile is similar to Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -Dacarbazine combination that was evaluated  in 
chemonaive patients earlier.(16) Clinical  trials during the past 8 years showed  that Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769513]-2.(17)
ABI-007 is a novel  Cremophor EL-free, non-crystalline, amorphous, albumin-bound  particle
form of paclitaxel suspended in normal  saline with several advantages over  Taxol:
Preclinical models  consistently demonstrated improved tolerability, increased  antitumor
activity and higher intratumor paclitaxel  levels  for ABI-007 compared to  Taxol. Recent
mechanistic studies  indicate that this increased antitumor  activity may be due to increased
tumor uptake of paclitaxel  that is mediated through albumin-receptors  on tumor
neovasculature.   ABI-007 is Cremophor EL-free and therefore associated with a reduced risk  of
hypersensitivity and no requirements for premedication  as compared  to Taxol.
ABI-007 does  not require steroid co-medication. ABI-007 is  better tolerated than Taxol. In a Phase I trial using  an every 3 week 
schedule of administration, the maximum  tolerated dose of ABI-007 (300 mg/m2) was substantially  higher than the labeled dose 
for Taxol (175 mg/m2).
The antitumor tumor activity of ABI-[ADDRESS_1055999] cancer.  
Rationale 
There is compelling evidence that chemotherapy-induced tumor  cell death triggers  an innate  immune response,  which is 
required for maximal therapeutic benefit. Dying tumor cells are recognized by [CONTACT_282550]-like  receptor 4 (TLR4) on dendritic cells, 
which leads to a widespread anti-tumor  immune  response. (21)  The Toll-like  receptors are  a large family of pattern-recognition  
receptors used by [CONTACT_769627], protein, and nucleic acid  components produced 
by [CONTACT_757677]. (22)  There  is mounting  evidence that  innate immunity  is also involved in recognizing and destroying  tumor cells.  
Apetoh and colleagues showed  that tumor cells killed by [CONTACT_769628]1  (high-mobility group  B1), an 
abundant DNA-binding nuclear protein that serves as a "danger signal" for the immune system.  (22)  Once released, HMGB1  
bind TLR4  and stimulate dendritic  cells to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and activate an  innate immune response. 
Stimulation of complementary immune pathways has been  shown to be  highly effective in eradicating large established  tumors. 
(23, 24)  An acute   release of de novo tumor antigen  from apoptosis induced  by [CONTACT_14181]-DR5 antibody followed  by [CONTACT_769629] T-
cell activation phase using anti-CD40  and anti-41BB antibodies is possible (23)  Another study,  with similar results, used the 
same synergistic treatment combination, except  that activation  of invariant NKT cells with alfa-galactosylceramide was used  in 
place of anti-CD40  (23)  Our clinical  trial protocol here will put into practice a similar synergistic approach  through 
immunotherapy with interferon-alfa, interleukin-[ADDRESS_1056000] shown response  rates in the range of  10 to 15% in a number of reported studies.(25) 
[CONTACT_769652] conducted a Phase II trial of ABI-007 in patients with previously treated  and chemotherapy  naive malignant 
melanoma.(26) Treatment  was given weekly for 3 weeks followed  by a one-week break period.  The objective  response  rate was 
22% in chemotherapy naive patients. The higher ABI-007  dose administered  to chemotherapy naïve patients,  while resulting in 
a higher  incidence of peripheral neuropathy,  was otherwise  generally well-tolerated. Myelosuppression was not problematic  in 
either cohort. (Hersh  et al Cancer  2010; 116:155-63).
Clinical trials involving the use of chemotherapy,  interferon,  interleukin-[ADDRESS_1056001]  
failed to give clinically significant  anti-tumor  T-cell responses.   Thus,  there  is a strong  rationale for combining immunologic 
agents, with cytotoxic anticancer agent  in a novel chemoimmunotherapy.  Our proposed novel therapy is designed in a rational 
fashion combining ABI-007 with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769514] T-cell  activation by [CONTACT_488]-presenting cells (APC), and  then cause T-cell activation and expansion against these 
newly-released antigens (and pre-existing  antigens) to generate  highest possible  number of tumor antigen-specific  T cells 
necessary for complete destruction of the tumor cells.   This will improve the anti-tumor immunity and survival.  Immunologic 
evaluation of the patients will be performed  prior to start of therapy and  during the therapy to clearly define the immune 
response and correlate  it with clinical  response.
2.0 Background Drug Information
2.1 ABI-007: Paclitaxel Protein-bound Particles
2.2.[ADDRESS_1056002]
ABI-007 (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension)(albumin-bound) is a
Cremophor EL-free, albumin-bound  particle form of paclitaxel. Each 50  mL vial contains
100 mg of paclitaxel, and approximately 900 mg of  human albumin, as a white to  yellow
sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution with 20 mL of 0.9%  Sodium  Chloride Injection.
2.2.2 Introduction
ABI-007 is a unique  protein formulation of a non-crystalline, amorphous form of paclitaxel
in an insoluble particle state. ABI-007  has been  developed to reduce the toxicities associated
with Taxol  (paclitaxel) Injection (in which  paclitaxel - from the native crystalline form - is in
solution with Cremophor EL/ethanol as the solvent) while maintaining or improving  its
chemotherapeutic effect. ABI-007  has been  approved in over 35 countries to date, including
the U.S. and Canada (and is under review in a number of other countries) for the treatment of
women with metastatic  breast cancer.
2.2.3 Preclinical Studies with ABI-007
Preclinical studies comparing  ABI-007 to Taxol  demonstrated lower toxicities, with a MTD
approximately 50% higher for ABI-007 compared to  Taxol. At equal  doses there was less
myelosuppression and improved efficacy  in a xenograft tumor  model of human mammary
adenocarcinoma. At equitoxic  doses  of paclitaxel, ABI-007 was  found to be  markedly  more
efficacious in these animal models  than Taxol.20
2.1.4 Clinical Studies with ABI-007
[IP_ADDRESS] Every 3 Weeks  Schedule
In a Phase I study, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  of ABI-007  was determined to be
300 mg/m2 by [ADDRESS_1056003] evaluated 2 dose levels of ABI-007 (300 mg/m2, n=63,
and 175 mg/m2, n=43) in patients  with metastatic  breast cancer. The response rates (complete
response [CR]+partial response [PR]) in these 2 Phase II trials were  40% (95% CI 25-54%)
for the 175 mg/m2  dose, and 48% (95%  CI 35-60%) for the 300 mg/m2  dose. Of 39 patients
receiving 300 mg/m2 as first-line therapy  for metastatic breast cancer, 64% (95% CI 49-79%)
responded (CR+PR).  This was contrasted  with a 45% response  rate in similar patients  at the
lower dose level. Grade 4 neutropenia was noted in 24% of patients  at the higher dose level,
occurred primarily during the first cycle and resolved rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. A Phase III trial in patients
with metastatic breast  cancer compared  ABI-007 260 mg/m2  to Taxol 175 mg/m2 given every
3 weeks. Significantly  higher efficacy  for ABI-007 vs Taxol was demonstrated  as measured
by [CONTACT_313346] (CR+PR, 33% vs 19%, p<0.001), time to tumor progression  (23.0  vs 16.6
weeks, p=0.002), and progression-free survival (22.7 vs 16.6 weeks, p=0.003). Survival was
longer with ABI-007, although the difference  was not statistically significant  (65.0  vs. 55.3
weeks, p=0.322).
[IP_ADDRESS] Weekly for [ADDRESS_1056004] in
patients with advanced solid tumors  has recently been completed.21 The MTDs for heavily
and lightly pre-treated patients were 100 and 150 mg/m2  respectively.  Dose limiting
toxicities included  myelosuppression  and peripheral neuropathy.  Premedication  was not
required, and unexpected, non-taxane associated  toxicities were not observed. In a Phase II
trial in heavily pretreated patients  with taxane-refractory  metastatic breast  cancer, objective
antitumor responses occurred in 18% of women  treated with ABI-007  100 mg/m2  on this
schedule.22 Toxicity was minimal and this study  has been amended to evaluate  an increased
dose of 125 mg/m2 in this patient population.  The tolerability of 150 mg/m2 in previously
untreated patients has been confirmed  in an interim analysis of 32 patients with malignant
melanoma who received a mean  of 3.5 cycles (range 1-9). To date there has been  1 case of
Grade 3 sensory  neuropathy (no Grade 4) and [ADDRESS_1056005] shown response  rates in the range of  10 to 15% in
a number of reported studies.23,[ADDRESS_1056006]. Evan Hersh conducted a Phase II trial of ABI-007 in
patients with previously treated  and chemotherapy naive malignant melanoma. Treatment
was given weekly for 3 weeks followed by a one-week break period. A higher weekly dose
of ABI-007 was given to chemotherapy naive patients (150 mg/m2). Results from the trial
are presented in the table below. As expected, the objective response rate was higher  in
chemotherapy naive patients. The higher ABI-007 dose administered  to chemotherapy naive
patients, while resulting  in a higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy,  was otherwise
generally well-tolerated.  Myelosuppression  was not problematic in  either cohort. (Hersh  et al Cancer 
2010; 116:155-63).
2.2.6 Potential Risks of ABI-007
ABI-007 is not formulated  in Cremophor and thus the risk of hypersensitivity reactions  is
much less than that of Taxol.  The major risks of ABI-007 were known  toxicities of paclitaxel.  See the Investigator
Brochure for a complete  description of all toxicities reported.
Myelosuppression, predominantly neutropenia.  Grade 4 neutropenia typi[INVESTIGATOR_769515] < [ADDRESS_1056007]  acetaminophen-containing medication.
Mucositis. Mucositis was typi[INVESTIGATOR_20539]  1 or 2 and not dose  limiting.
Alopecia. Similar  to that seen with Taxol.
2.2.7 Advantages  of ABI-007
ABI-007 is a novel  Cremophor EL-free, non-crystalline, amorphous, albumin-bound  particle
form of paclitaxel suspended in normal  saline with several advantages over  Taxol:
Preclinical  models  consistently demonstrated improved  tolerability, increased  antitumor activity and higher intratumor  paclitaxel 
levels for ABI-007  compared to Taxol.  Recent mechanistic studies indicate that this increased antitumor  activity may be due to 
increased tumor uptake of  paclitaxel  that is mediated through albumin-receptors on tumor neovasculature.26
ABI-007 does  not require steroid co-medication.
ABI-007 is better tolerated than Taxol. In a Phase I trial using  an every 3 week schedule of administration, the maximum 
tolerated dose of ABI-007 (300 mg/m2)  was substantially higher than the labeled  dose for Taxol (175 mg/m2).27
The antitumor  tumor activity of ABI-[ADDRESS_1056008] cancer and a Phase III study utilizing ABI-007 at a dose  of 260 mg/m2 
every [ADDRESS_1056009] cancer. 
The major  components of ABI-007  are unmodified paclitaxel and human  albumin. The absence of Cremophor EL  in the 
formulation allows the infusion  of ABI-007  in approximately 30  minutes.
ABI-007 is Cremophor EL-free  and therefore associated with a reduced  risk of hypersensitivity and no  requirements for  
premedication as compared to Taxol. The Cremophor EL constituent in Taxol  requires special  non-DEHP  tubing and in-line 
filters for intravenous administration, since  Cremophor  EL causes leaching of the tubing  plasticizers. ABI-007 requires no 
special tubing  or in-line filters.
2.2.8 Packaging, Labeling, and Storage of Study Drug
ABI-007 will be supplied by [CONTACT_769630]-use vials. Each single-use 50  mL vial will
contain paclitaxel (100 mg) and approximately 900 mg human albumin (HA)  as a stabilizer.
Each vial will be labeled according to country-specific regulatory requirements  for labeling
of investigational  products. Unreconstituted ABI-007 should be stored  at controlled room
temperature (25°C  or 77°F; excursions  permitted  to 15-30ºC [See USP controlled room
temperature]). Reconstituted ABI-[ADDRESS_1056010] be placed  in its carton and be placed  in a refrigerator at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for  a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_1056011] 
Research Organization (CRO) monitoring  teams for  verification of proper  study drug storage. Only completely unused study 
drug vials should be destroyed per institutional policy. Partially used  and completely used  vials should be destroyed according  
to the site’s guidelines, and their disposition should be recorded on the Investigational  Drug Accountability Record Form. The 
investigator, or designee, shall record  the dispensing of study drug to patients and  any remaining study drug after dosing in a 
study drug accountability record. The study  drug record will be made available to  Celgene, or other  authorized Celgene-
designated monitoring personnel for the purpose  of accounting for the study drug supply. Inspections of the study drug supply 
for inventory purposes and assurance  of proper storage will be conducted as necessary. Any significant  discrepancy will be 
recorded and reported to Celgene  or their designee and a plan for resolution will be documented.
2.2.9 Study  Medication Administration
NOTE: The use of an in-line filter is not recommended.
ABI-007 will be reconstituted by [CONTACT_769631]. The investigator  
will calculate the body  surface area (BSA) of the patient using methods that  are standard for their institution in  order to 
determine the total amount of paclitaxel  to be administered.
Reconstitution and use of ABI-007:
1.Calculate the patient’s  BSA according  to standard institutional methods. BSA  will be calculated at Baseline and can be 
recalculated according to  institutional standards. BSA must be  recalculated  if body weight  changes by [CONTACT_56944]  10%. Dosing 
BSA may be capped if the treating  physician  believes it is in the best interest  of an obese patient.
2.Calculate the total dose (in mg) to be administered by: [CONTACT_456376] (mg)  = BSA x (study dose mg/m2)
3.Calculate the total number of vials required by: [CONTACT_769632] = Total Dose (mg)  100 (mg/vial) Round up  the number of 
vials to be reconstituted to the next higher whole number  when  a fractional number  of vials is  obtained  by [CONTACT_769633] 
(eg, if the total number  of vials = 4.05 or 4.5, then 5 vials would be  reconstituted).
4.Using sterile technique, prepare the vials for reconstitution.
5.Swab  the rubber stoppers  with alcohol.
6.Reconstitute each ABI-[ADDRESS_1056012] 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 
equivalent into each vial over a period of not less than 1 minute (Note: Change  the syringes  after reconstituting  every 3 vials). 
Slowly inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection over  a minimum of 1 minute, using the sterile syringe 
directing the solution flow onto the inside  wall of the vial.
DO NOT INJECT the 0.9%  Sodium Chloride Injection solution directly  onto the lyophilized cake as this will result in 
foaming.
Once the injection is complete, allow  the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure proper  wetting of the lyophilized  
cake/powder.
Gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete dissolution of  any cake/powder occurs. 
Avoid generation of foam.
If foaming or clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_4095],  stand  solution  for at least  [ADDRESS_1056013] total dosing  volume of 5 mg/mL suspension  required  for the patient: Dosing volume (mL) = Total dose 
(mg) / 5 (mg/mL)
8.The reconstituted sample should be milky and homogeneous without  visible particulates. If unsuspended powder is visible, the 
vial should be gently  inverted again  to ensure complete resuspension,  prior to use.
9.Use immediately following  reconstitution. If not used immediately, replace the reconstituted vial in the carton and  store 
reconstituted ABI-[ADDRESS_1056014] perpendicularly  into the center  of the injection port to avoid  dislodging plastic  material into the IV bag.  
Repeat steps 9 and 10  until the patient’s  entire required  dose is  injected  into the IV bag.
12.Remove the injection port.
13.Once the exact volume of reconstituted ABI-[ADDRESS_1056015]  an
inventory and sign the study drug receipt. A copy of the drug receipt  should be made and
retained in the investigator's regulatory  file records. The original  should be sent to the
address indicated on the stamped self addressed envelope  included with the shipment.
A representative from Celgene or his/her designee will inspect  the study drug inventory, and will authorize the destruction  of any 
remaining unused  study drug. If the investigational site has a policy, procedure or SOP  detailing the process to follow  for study  
drug destruction, the pharmacist or designee can choose to destroy  the study drug on site.  The following information must be 
recorded on the site’s pharmacy drug accountability log: quantity  of vials destroyed, expi[INVESTIGATOR_166404].  The 
pharmacist must document that the study  drug was destroyed in accordance with their institution’s drug destruction policy or 
SOP.  A drug destruction memo and the site’s drug destruction SOP/policy should  be sent to Celgene Medical Operations Dept. 
A copy of the drug destruction memo should be retained at the clinical site.  In the event  of study  completion or termination, a 
copy of all pharmacy records (drug  dispensing log, drug accountability log and any destruction memos) must be mailed to  
Celgene Medical  Operations.
2.[ADDRESS_1056016] allowed  the rational design of new strategies 
for immunotherapy of tumors, including  melanoma. It has been known for  some time that engagement of the T cell  antigen 
receptor by [CONTACT_485349] T cell activation; a second  co-stimulatory signal is required for induction  of IL-2  
production, proliferation  and differentiation to effector function of  naive T cells. Abundant  data now indicate  that the primary 
source of this stimulation is mediated  by [CONTACT_485350]28 on  the T cell surface by [CONTACT_769634] B7 family on the 
antigen-presenting cell (APC). [Lenschow D.J., et al., CD28/B7 system of T cell costimulation. Ann Rev Immunol, 1996.  14: p. 
233-58]. (See Figure 1.)  
Figure 1Mechanism of Action
Expression of B7 has been shown to be limited to “professional”  antigen  presenting cells; that is, specialized cells  of the 
hematopoietic lineage, including dendritic cells, activated macrophages, and  activated B cells. It has been suggested that  this 
sharply-defined restriction of B7 expression is a fail-safe  mechanism for  maintenance of peripheral T cell tolerance,  insuring that 
T cell activation  can only be stimulated by [CONTACT_485351]  [Schwartz  R.H. Costimulation  of T lymphocytes: the role of CD28,  
CTLA4, and B7/BB1 in interleukin-2 production and immunotherapy. Cell, 1992.  71(7): p. 1065-8].  The fact  that tumor cells  do 
not express  B7 contributes to their poor capacity to elicit immune  responses [Chen L.S., et al., Costimulation  of antitumor 
immunity by [CONTACT_941] B7 counterreceptor for the T lymphocyte molecules CD28 and CTLA-4. Cell, 1992. 71(7):  p. 1093-102., 
Townsend S.E., et al., Tumor rejection after direct costimulation  of CD8+  T cells by B7-transfected melanoma cells.  Science, 
1993. 259(5093): p. 368-70].
The demonstration that induction of expression  of B7 on many tumor cells by [CONTACT_506373], transduction,  or other mechanisms 
can heighten tumor immunogenicity  led to great interest in  pursuing this as an approach to tumor immunotherapy. As 
demonstrated in vivo in murine tumor  models,  the utility  of B7 expression as a vaccination  approach is limited by [CONTACT_463747]: (1) B7-expressing  tumor  cell vaccines are only effective when the tumor cells have  a high degree of  inherent 
immunogenicity; (2) while  B7-expressing vaccines have been  shown in many  cases to be effective in inducing protective 
immune responses, they have demonstrated only limited  utility in inducing  responses to established tumors; and (3) inactivation 
of tumor cells by [CONTACT_665467]-enhancing activity of the B7 gene  product  [Townsend S.E., et 
al., Specificity and longevity of antitumor immune responses  induced by B7-transfected  tumors. Cancer Res, 1994. 54(24): 
p.6477-83., Allison J.P., et al., Manipulation of co-stimulatory signals to enhance antitumor t cell responses.  Curr Opin  Immunol, 
1995. 7(5): p. 682-6].
In the past few years  it has become apparent that co-stimulation is even more complex than originally thought.  After  activation, 
T cells express CTLA-4, a close  homologue to CD28. CTLA-4 binds  members of the B7 family  with a much higher affinity  than 
CD28 [Linsley  P.S.,  et al., CTLA-4  is a second receptor  for the B cell activation antigen B7. J Exp Med, 1991. 174(3): p. 561-
9].  Although there was initially some controversy as to the role of  CTLA-4 in regulating T  cell activation, it has become  clear that 
CTLA-4 down-regulates  T cell responses  [Thompson C.B., and Allison J.P. The emerging role of  CTLA-4 as an immune 
attenuator. Immunity,  1997. 7(4): p.445-50]. This was initially suggested by [CONTACT_485353]: (1) blockade of 
CTLA-4/B7 interactions with antibody enhanced T cell responses; (2)  cross-linking of  CTLA-4 with CD3 and CD28 inhibited T 
cell responses; and (3) administration  of antibodies to CTLA-4  in vivo enhanced the immune response to peptide antigens or 
superantigens in mice  [Walunas T.L., et al., CTLA-4 can function  as a negative regulator  of T cell activation. Immunity, 1994. 
1(5): p. 405-13.,  Kearney E.R., et al., Antigen-dependent  clonal expansion  of a trace population of antigen-specific  CD4+ T cells 
in vivo is dependent on CD28 costimulation and inhibited by [CONTACT_485]-4. J Immunol, 1995. 155(3):  p. 1032-6., Krummel  M.F. and 
Allison J.P. CD28  and CTLA-[ADDRESS_1056017] opposing effects on the response of T cells to stimulation. J Exp Med 1995; 182(2): p. 459-

expansion in vitro and in vivo. Int Immunol,  1996. 8(4): p. 519-23]. Blocking CTLA-4-B7 interaction while preserving  signaling via 
CD28 resulted in enhanced T cell responses  in vitro.[ADDRESS_1056019]  convincing demonstration of the down-regulatory role of CTLA-4  came from examination of mice with a null 
mutation [Tivol E.A., et al., Loss  of CTLA-4 leads to massive lymphoproliferation and fatal multiorgan  tissue  destruction,  
revealing a critical negative regulatory role of CTLA-4. Immunity, 1995.  3(5): p. 541-7., Waterhouse  P. et al., 
Lymphoproliferative disorders with early  lethality in mice deficient in CTLA-4. Science, 1995. 270(5238): p. 985-8., Chambers 
C.A., et al., Lymphoproliferation in CTLA-4-deficient mice is mediated by [CONTACT_377287]-dependent activation of CD4+ T cells.

approximately 1 week after birth, followed by [CONTACT_769635]. These  mice die at 
approximately 3 weeks of age, either as a result  of polyclonal T  cell expansion and tissue destruction or as a result of toxic 
shock resulting from lymphokine  production  by [CONTACT_941] T cells. Since thymocyte  differentiation and selection proceed normally in 
CTLA-4-deficient mice, the rampant T cell expansion that  occurs in the mice indicates  that CTLA-4 plays  a critical role in down-
regulating T cell responses in the periphery.12

generated that is capable of producing more Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79230] a per cell basis  than the hybridoma.  Material from the transfectoma  
will be utilized in this and future Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769516]. Biochemical, immunologic and in vivo preclinical  primate 
assessments demonstrated similarity  between hybridoma and  transfectoma-derived Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
2.1.2   Pre-Clinical Toxicology  of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_561578]-clinical toxicology studies can be found  in the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_121002] (IB) Appendix 
C. Non-clinical  toxicity  assessments included in vitro evaluation  for the potential  of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769517]-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDCC) or antibody-dependent cellular  cytotoxicity (ADCC),  and toxicology  assessments  in 
cynomolgus monkeys  alone and in the presence of vaccines.
The in vitro studies demonstrated that Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769518]- or (CD)3-activated human T cells. However, 
low to moderate ADCC activity was noted at concentrations  up to 50  ug/mL. These  data are  consistent with the requirement of 
high levels of antigen  expression on the surface of  target cells for efficient ADCC  or CDCC.  Since  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a human IgG1,  
an isotype generally  capable of mediating CDCC  and ADCC, the lack of these  activities is  likely due to a very low expression of 
CTLA-[ADDRESS_1056022]  that Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769519] 
T cells in vivo. Indeed,  no depletion of T cells or T cell subsets were  noted in toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys.
No mortality or signs of toxicity were observed in three independent 14-day  intravenous toxicology studies  in cynomolgus 
monkeys at multiple doses up to 30 mg/kg/dose. Furthermore, Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769520] B (HepB) Vaccine  and Melanoma Vaccine.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769521]. There were no significant  changes  in clinical signs, body weight  values, clinical 
pathology values or T cell activation  markers. In addition, there  were no significant  histopathology changes in  the stomach or  
colon.
2.1.3   Human Pharmacokinetics of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_561582] (PK) profiles for Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769522]. The primary  objective of Protocol MDX010-015 was to 
determine the safety and PK profile  of single and multiple  doses of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769523] a transfectoma or  hybridoma cell 
line. Mean  plasma concentrations of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769524] 3 mg/kg  (hybridoma-derived drug product); 2.8 mg/kg, 
5 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg,  and 20 mg/kg (transfectoma-derived drug product) demonstrated approximate  dose 
proportionality. Equimolar doses  of hybridoma-derived and transfectoma-derived drug product had comparable PK  profiles. The 
range of mean volume of distribution  at steady  state (Vss) across cohorts 2.8, 3,  5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg, was 57.3 to 82.6 
mL/kg, indicating drug distribution was mostly limited to the intravascular  space.  The clearance was low (range 0.11 to 0.29 
mL/h/kg) and reflective  of the half-life  (range 297 to 414 h), which  is consistent with the long terminal disposition phase of 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. There was moderate variability  in the PK parameters among  subjects,  with CV of 11% to 48% in  AUC(0-21d), 20% 
to 59% in CL, and 17% to 46% in Vss.
2.1.4 Clinical Safety  with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769525]  (unresectable 
Stage III or Stage IV) to potentially demonstrate an improvement on a large  unmet  medical need in this population.
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769526] 2633 patients with  different cancers in 24 completed or ongoing  clinical 
trials as of 31-Mar-2008  with a dose range  between 0.3 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg. Most experience with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79233] 3 
mg/kg and 10 mg/kg  dose levels. Patients  who received Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3 mg/kg  were  treated in clinical studies conducted  early  
in the development program  and received either a single or multiple injections.  Intra-patient  dose escalation indicated that 
patients who were unresponsive  at the 3 mg/kg  dose level may have responded to 9 mg/kg. Based on  preliminary data on the 
10 mg/kg dose level of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the ongoing clinical program  investigating  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769527] 10 
mg/kg dose level with the expectation that 10 mg/kg will prove more beneficial than 3 mg/kg.
[IP_ADDRESS]  Details of Drug-Related Adverse Events
Drug-related adverse events were  reported in studies  with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769528], cytokines or chemotherapy. The AE profile of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769529], with most drug-related AEs 
being Immune-Related Adverse Events  (irAEs) which are  considered to be associated  with the mechanism of action of 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The most  common irAEs are colitis  and diarrhea, rash,  pruritis, deficiencies of  endocrine organs (pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117],  adrenal  
or thyroid),  hepatitis, and uveitis.  Rare complications  are bowel perforations  (~1%) resulting from underlying  severe colitis, 
which have required  surgical intervention.
[IP_ADDRESS]   Drug-Related Serious Adverse  Events
Drug-related Grade  3 or Grade  4 serious adverse events (SAEs) include: rash/desquamation, pruritus, uveitis, speech 
impairment, abdominal  pain, diarrhea/colitis,  nausea/vomiting, transaminase elevation,  adrenal insufficiency, panhypopi[INVESTIGATOR_769530]. Some  of these events, such as rash/desquamation, pruritus,  uveitis, diarrhea/colitis, transaminase  
elevation, adrenal  insufficiency and panhypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], may represent drug induced  irAEs.  Refer to the most  recent version of 
the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769531].
Among subjects treated with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg, SAEs considered possibly,  probably, or definitely related  to study drug were  
reported for 26% of subjects (176/675). Drug related SAEs  reported in at least 1%  of the 675 subjects at 10 mg/kg  included 
diarrhea (10%), colitis (7%), vomiting  (3%), dehydration (3%), autoimmune hepatitis  (2%),  hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297] (2%), nausea (2%),  
abdominal pain (2%),  pyrexia  (2%),  aspartate  aminotransferase increased (1%),  alanine aminotransferase increased (1%),  and 
fatigue (1%).
2.1.5  Immune-Related Adverse  Events (irAEs) with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769532] a consequence of the 
intrinsic biological activity of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  An irAE is defined as any adverse event associated  with drug exposure and consistent 
with an immune-mediated event. Disease progression, infections and other etiologic  causes are  ruled out or deemed unlikely  as 
contributing to the event. Supportive data, such as autoimmune  serology tests  or biopsies, are helpful but not necessary to  
deem an event an irAE. Events of unclear  etiology which were plausibly “immune-mediated” have  been conservatively 
categorized as irAEs  even if serologic or histopathology data are absent. These irAEs  likely reflect a loss of tolerance to some 
self antigens or an unchecked immune  response  to gut or skin flora.  Some breakthrough  of immunity  may be inseparably  linked 
to the clinical antitumor  activity of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
Approximately 60% of subjects developed any grade irAEs  which involved predominately the gastrointestinal  (GI) tract,  
endocrine glands, liver, or skin. Based on data from the safety  database, the number of subjects with serious, dose-limiting  
irAEs was approximately 15% (401/2633), including 8.2%  for serious GI irAEs (diarrhea and/or  colitis), 2.2% of serious  
endocrinopathy (primarily hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297]) and <1% of serious skin  irAEs. Bowel perforation  was reported  in 
approximately 1% of subjects. With few exceptions these irAEs were clinically manageable  and reversible with supportive  care 
or corticosteroids. In responding patients,  addition of corticosteroids does not appear to  have a temporal relationship  to change 
in objective tumor response.
Additionally, as of February 2006,  there  has been observation from a National Cancer Institute (NCI) study of bowel wall 
perforation in some patients who were administered a high-dose  IL-[ADDRESS_1056023] dose of 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] > [ADDRESS_1056024] dose of IL-2. Two of the patients had clinically significant Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]-related diarrhea  or 
colitis and the symptoms had completely resolved prior to IL-2 administration. One patient did not experience  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]-related  
diarrhea. It is unknown  whether this observation represents a true association or is mechanistically unrelated to prior Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769533].
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug-Related Deaths
Based on reports from the safety  data base as of June  30, 2008,  there  have been  reports of death (approximately 1% 
[28/3000]), deemed  by [CONTACT_769636]. The most  common  cause of drug 
related deaths was GI perforation. Other  causes included multiorgan failure, sepsis,  hypotension, acidosis, and adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421].  For details on all drug-related deaths,  refer to the current version of the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_121002].
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  of 10 mg/kg Multiple Doses
Based on a review  of the program-wide SAE data as previously  reported, evidence had suggested that Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]-associated 
irAEs were dose dependent  in frequency,  and higher irAE rates had been observed  at 10 mg/kg than at  lower  doses of 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Subsequently,  this dose-dependent effect  was further  demonstrated in CA184-022  in which three dose levels of 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_561599],  including  0.3 vs 3 vs 10 mg/kg.  Table 1 summarizes the overall  irAE frequencies by [CONTACT_561699]184-
022 based on safety data from the locked clinical database.
Qualitatively, the safety profile of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460545] 10 mg/kg remains  consistent with the low-dose  safety profile in  that most of the 
drug-related SAEs are characteristic of immune-related toxicity, and most of the irAEs are reported in the GI, hepatic, and  
endocrine systems. However,  the data presented in Table [ADDRESS_1056025]  that the frequency of irAEs in association  with 10 mg/kg of

[IP_ADDRESS] Neuropathies
Isolated cases of motor  neuropathy of an autoimmune  origin have been reported among patients treated with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Two  
cases have been diagnosed as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), only one  of which was  considered study  related.  As of July 2, 
2008, [ADDRESS_1056026] occurred  across a spectrum  of doses and 
schedules.
Based on a preliminary analysis for study  MDX010-15 involving  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  10 mg/kg multiple doses, 34.8% of patients  (N = 23) 
were progression-free at 6 months and about  17.4% were progression-free at 1 year. In comparison, for Study  MDX010-08 
involving Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg multiple doses, 10.8% patients (N = 37) had progression-free survival at 6 months  and 8.4% at 1 
year. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769536] (dacarbazine),  melanoma vaccines  (gp100), and

[IP_ADDRESS] Relationship Between  Response  and Immune Breakthrough Events in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma
Drug-related AEs of any grade considered to be immune-mediated in  nature (irAEs) were  reported for 54.0% of subjects in  
clinical studies  of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. These  irAEs are a consequence of inhibiting  CTLA-[ADDRESS_1056027] were reported as Grade 1 
or 2. An association  between BORR  and higher grade (Grade 3-4) irAEs was suggested  in early  studies of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  3 mg/kg 
but this association was not observed in 4 Phase 2 studies of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (CA184022, CA184008, CA184007 and CA184004).  
There were proportionally more subjects with irAEs  of any grade who experienced response  or stable disease than subjects  
without irAEs who experienced response or stable disease, but due to the small sample  sizes, these observations were 
statistically inconclusive (CA184022 Clinical  Study Report.  A Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Multi-center, Phase II  Fixed Dose

2.1.7 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Results from the [ADDRESS_1056028] that  the 10 mg/kg dose is  active and  offers  the best benefit to 
risk ratio based on a 27.1% to 35.1%  rate of disease control  and a favorable 1-year survival rate of 48.6% to 59.1% compared 
with that  reported in the literature (25.5% to 35%). (Korn EL, Liu P-Y, Lee S, et al. Meta-analysis  of phase II cooperative group

Melanoma Study. J Clin Oncol. 2006:24:4738  4745). Substantial  reductions in total tumor burden,  including widely disseminated 
disease in the skin, lung, and/or  other visceral disease sites,  were reported.  More than half the responses were reported in 
subjects staged with M1b or M1c advanced melanoma disease,  which is most resistant  to approved  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The  kinetics of 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769539] (CR,  PR and SD) as well as novel patterns, characterized  by [CONTACT_769637], including existing  and new lesions, after  initial tumor volume increase  and/or after appearance  of new 
lesions. In the pretreated population at 10 mg/kg in 2 of the 3 studies, disease control after initial tumor volume increase and/or  
new lesions was reported for 9.7% of subjects.  Across  all 3 studies, stable disease was often  accompanied  by [CONTACT_769638]. All patterns of response, including SD, appeared to result in favorable 
survival, based on 1-year survival rates.
Characteristic organ-specific inflammatory  irAEs were reported with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769540], typi[INVESTIGATOR_769541].  
Immune related adverse  events  were mostly reversible within  days to weeks  following cessation  of therapy or treatment  with 
symptomatic therapy, corticosteroids or other  anti-inflammatory agents, depending upon  severity. Accumulated clinical 
experience resulted in detailed toxicity  management  guidelines  (also termed algorithms), by [CONTACT_769639], especially when  irAEs are recognized early and subjects are treated  in a timely fashion. This can minimize 
the occurrence of irAE complications, such  as GI perforation/colectomy  or hepatic failure. 
Treatment with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769542].  
Clinically relevant reductions  in the tumor  burden from baseline  were reported, together with a preliminary evidence of improved 
overall survival compared with published survival rates. These  findings, together  with evidence of a safety profile that is 
manageable with careful monitoring and appropriate intervention for treatment of immune-related toxicities, suggest an 
acceptable benefit to risk ratio.  The overall  risk-benefit  ratio for patients  entering this protocol is therefore at least comparable to 
and possibly better  than alternative options.

[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation and Administration Guidelines
The supplies needed for Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769557]. The 
product may be infused using  a volumetric pump at the protocol-specific dose(s) and rate(s)  through a PVC IV solution  infusion  
set with a 0.2 mm or 1.2 mm in-line polyethersulfone or 1.2 mm positively charged nylon filter to complete the infusion in  90 
minutes, with a 10-mL  normal saline flush  at the completion of the infusion.
1)As Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754683] (2-8ºC), allow the appropriate  number  of vials  of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769558].
2)Aseptically  withdraw the required volume of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404327] a syringe.  Insert the needle at an angle  into the 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_754685] – bevel side down  – against the glass, with the tip touching the neck of the vial. 
The initial solution concentration  is 5 mg/mL. [Note: A sufficient excess of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769559]].
3)Ensure that the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404326], essentially free from particulate  matter on visual inspection. If multiple 
vials are needed  for a subject, it is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each vial to prevent  problems  such  
as dulling of needle tip, stopper coring,  repeated friction of plunger against syringe barrel  wall, etc.
4)Inject Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769560] a final  infusion  volume  that 
has been calculated from the weight of the patient.
5)If the total dose  calculates to less than 90 mL of solution  then the total dose needed should be diluted to a total volume  of 90 
mL in 0.9% sodium chloride. 
6)Mix by [CONTACT_769641]. DO NOT shake.
7)Visually inspect the final solution.  If the initial  diluted solution or final dilution  for infusion is not clear or  contents appear to 
contain precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], the solution should be discarded.
8)Do not draw into each vial more  than once. Any partial vials should be safely  discarded and  should not be stored for reuse.

adequate for treatment on day 8 and/or 15, the dose will be omitted for that  day and the total cycle length remains the same.  If 
the ANC and platelets are not adequate on day 15, the dose will be omitted  and that week  will become the week  of rest.  The 
next dose  (if counts and chemistries  permit) becomes Day [ADDRESS_1056037]  had a 21 day 
cycle.  
A maximum of two dose reductions will be allowed from the original dose to the following dose levels:
1st dose reduction;  Level-1: ABI-007  dose will be decreased from original dose of 150mg/m2 to 120mg/m2 weekly
2nd dose reduction; Level-2:  ABI-007  dose will be decreased from 120mg/m2 to 90mg/m2 weekly
ABI-007 cycles  will be repeated at 4-week intervals as soon as the absolute neutrophil count has recovered  to near 1500/mm3

Patients who develop  prolonged neutropenic fever or infection during neutropenia, will have their doses of ABI-[ADDRESS_1056039]  cycle of therapy.  Patients who develop 
significant peripheral neuropathy  causing any evidence of ataxia or difficulty with function  of the fingers such  as writing  or 
buttoning the clothes, will not receive  any additional ABI-007.  Development  of moderately severe  paresthesia will be used as a 
guideline to hold further therapy with ABI-007.  Patients in whom  ABI-007 therapy is discontinued will receive  their  subsequent  
doses of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769565] 4 doses of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224]. 
If a toxicity requiring dose modification occurs  following the second dose reduction, further  treatment  should  be discontinued.
Rules for Dose Omissions  and Modified Schedules for ABI-007 during  second and subsequent cycles:
Day 1 dose missed:
If the dose held or missed was to be given on Day [ADDRESS_1056040] dose is actually administered to  the patient  
Day 8 dose is missed:
Cycle continues per protocol, with one dose  not given, Day 15 is administered as per cycle  
calendar if counts and chemistries permit.
Day 15 dose missed:
That week becomes the week of rest. Next dose (if counts  and chemistries permit) becomes
Day [ADDRESS_1056041] had 21-day  cycle.
[IP_ADDRESS] Administration of Study Drug to Patients with Abnormal Hematologic  Function
Abraxane dosing  should not be administered at the start of  each cycle until the ANC count returns  to >1500/mm3 and the 
platelet count retuns  to > 100,000/mm3.  For patients receiving weekly Abraxane, for each subsequent  dose of Abraxane within 
a cycle (days 8 and 15) patients must have ANC > 1000/mm3 and  platelets  > 75,000/mm3.   If the ANC and platelets  are not 
adequate for treatment on day 8, the dose will be omitted  and the total cycle length remains  the same.  If the ANC and platelets 
are not adequate  on day 15, the dose will be omitted and that week will become  the week of  rest.  The next dose (if counts and 
chemistries permit) becomes Day [ADDRESS_1056042] had  a 21 day cycle.  
Colony Stimulating  Factor Administration:
Colony stimulating factors  may be given according to institutional  guidelines for the
treatment of neutropenic fever or infections  associated with neutropenia.   If a patient develops neutropenia after receiving study 
drug, the investigator may administer antibiotics  as a prophylactic measure with subsequent cycles. 
All medications administered to a patient (e.g., growth factors, antibiotics, etc.) must be documented.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Reductions for Non-hematologic  Toxicity
HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS
Minor symptoms such as flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, hypotension, or tachycardia may
require temporary interruption of the infusion. However, severe reactions,  such as
hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema or
generalized urticaria require immediate discontinuation of study  drug administration  and
aggressive symptomatic therapy. Patients who develop severe hypersensitivity  reactions to
ABI-007 should not be re-challenged with the drug.
PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY
ABRAXANE should be withheld in patients who experience Grade 3 sensory  neuropathy.  Treatment  may be  resumed 
at the next lower dose level in subsequent  cycles after the sensory neuropathy  improves  to  Grade 1. The time to 
resolution to Grade  1 should  be the adverse event  duration used for adverse event reporting.  In those  patients who 
experience Grade 4 sensory neuropathy, study drug should be withheld, and treatment resumed at a reduction  of 2 
dose levels in subsequent cycles after the sensory neuropathy improves  to  Grade 1.  Note:  the investigator may elect 
to dose modify for Grade [ADDRESS_1056043] treatment discontinued.
OTHER NON-HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITIES
If toxicities are Grade  2, manage symptomatically if possible, and  re-treat without dose
reduction.  If toxicities are Grade  3, treatment should be  withheld until resolution  to Grade  ≤ 1 or baseline if baseline was 
greater than Grade  1, then reinstituted, if medically appropriate, at the next lower  dose level.  Recurrence of a Grade 3 or 4 
toxicity following  2 dose  reductions will necessitate discontinuation of treatment.
Administration of Study  Drug to Patients with Abnormal Hepatic Function:
Hepatic dysfunction that occurs  while  the patient is on study should prompt an evaluation to 
determine the cause,  including the possibility  of progressive metastatic  disease and hepatotoxicity from concurrent 
medications.  ABI-007 should not be administered if total serum bilirubin  is > 1.5mg/dl.  
Treatment for Brain metastases
Patients who develop  brain  metastases  as their only sites of progressive disease may continue on this study after being treated 
(whole brain radiotheraphy, surgery or gamma  knife) if they still otherwise continue to  meet the eligibility criteria  and if the 
investigator feels it is in the patient's best interest to  continue on study. Therapy with study drug should be interrupted for  at 
least 1 week  after the patient has completed  treatment for the brain metastases and has recovered from any associated side  
effects of treatment.  For the purpose of data analysis, the date of progression for  the patient  will be the date  the brain 
metastasis was documented radiographically or clinically.

Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs): Definition, Monitoring, and Treatment  Blocking CTLA-4 function may permit the 
emergence of auto-reactive T cells and resultant clinical  autoimmunity. Rash/vitiligo, diarrhea/colitis,  uveitis/epi[INVESTIGATOR_227],  
hepatitis, and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_228]-related, presumptive autoimmune events, now termed irAEs, noted in previous 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_229].
For the purposes of this study,  an irAE is defined as an AE of unknown etiology associated  with drug exposure and consistent 
with an immune  phenomenon. Efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic  
causes prior to labeling  an AE an irAE. Serological, immunological,  and histological (biopsy)  data should be used to support  the 
diagnosis of an immune-mediated toxicity. Suspected irAEs must be documented on  an AE or SAE form. 
Patients should be informed of and carefully  monitored for evidence of clinically significant  systemic irAE (e.g., systemic  lupus 
erythematosus-like diseases) or organ-specific irAE (e.g.,  rash, colitis, uveitis, hepatitis  or thyroid disease). If an irAE  is noted, 
appropriate work-up (including biopsy if possible) should be  performed, and steroid  therapy may be considered  if clinically 
necessary. See Appendix E for suggested work-up and treatment of irAEs.
It is unknown if systemic corticosteroid therapy  has an attenuating  effect on Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_230]. However, clinical  anti-tumor 
responses have been maintained in patients  treated with corticosteroids and discontinued  from Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. If  utilized, 
corticosteroid therapy should  be individualized for each patient. Prior experience  suggests that  colitis manifested  as > Grade 3 
diarrhea requires corticosteroid treatment. See Appendix E for  additional details.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Guidance
Treatment of Infusion Reactions Associated with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769585], it is less likely that any allergic reaction  will be seen in patients. 
However, it is possible that infusion  of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_232] a cytokine release syndrome  that could be evidenced  by [CONTACT_411], 
chills, rigors, rash, pruritus, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  No prophylactic pre-medication  will 
be given unless indicated by [CONTACT_769642]. Reactions  should be treated based upon the following 
recommendations.
For mild symptoms  (e.g., localized cutaneous reactions such as mild pruritus, flushing,  rash):
¨Decrease  the rate of infusion until recovery  from symptoms, remain  at bedside and monitor  patient.
¨Complete  the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_233].
¨Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV may be administered at  the discretion  of the treating physician  and patients may receive  
additional doses  with close monitoring.
¨Premedication with diphenhydramine may be given at  the discretion  of the investigator for subsequent doses of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
For moderate symptoms (any symptom  not listed above [mild symptoms] or below [severe  symptoms] such as generalized 
pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, hypotension  with systolic  BP >80 mmHg): 
¨Interrupt Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
¨Administer diphenhydramine  50 mg IV.
¨Monitor patient closely  until resolution of symptoms.
¨Corticosteroids may abrogate any beneficial immunologic effect, but may be  administered  at the discretion  of the treating 
physician.
¨Resume Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769586].
¨At the discretion of the treating physician, Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769587], then 
increased incrementally to the initial  infusion  rate.
¨If symptoms develop after resumption of the infusion, the infusion should be discontinued  and no additional Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769588].
¨The next dose  of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769589]-medication 
(diphenhydramine and acetaminophen) and careful monitoring, following  the same treatment guidelines outlined  above.
¨At the discretion of the treating physician  additional oral or IV antihistamine may be administered prior  to dosing with 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
For severe symptoms (e.g.,  any reaction  such  as bronchospasm, generalized urticaria,  systolic blood  pressure 80 mm Hg, or  
angioedema):
¨Immediately discontinue infusion of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and disconnect  infusion  tubing from the subject.
¨Consider  bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1 mg IV or subcutaneously, and/or diphenhydramine  50 mg  IV, with solumedrol 100  
mg IV, as needed.
¨Patients should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur.
¨No further Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_239].
In case of late-occurring hypersensitivity  symptoms (e.g., appearance within  one week  after treatment  of a localized or  
generalized pruritus), symptomatic treatment may be  given (e.g., oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).
Treatment of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]-Related Isolated  Drug Fever
In the event of isolated drug fever, the investigator must use  clinical judgment to determine  if the fever  is related to the 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_241].  If a patient experiences isolated  drug fever,  for the next dose, pre-treatment with 
acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (investigator discretion) should be instituted  and a repeated antipyretic 
dose at [ADDRESS_1056046] dosing with an appropriate  
antipyretic, the infusion rate for subsequent dosing should be decreased  to 50% of the previous rate. If fever recurs  following 
infusion rate change, the investigator should assess the patient’s level of  discomfort with the event and use clinical  judgment to 
determine if the patient should receive  further  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
5.4.2 Concomitant  Medications
Patients may not participate in any other  clinical protocol or investigational  trial that  involves
administration of experimental therapy  and/or  the use of investigational  devices with
therapeutic intent while  enrolled in this study.
Radiotherapy, other  than to control  brain metastases is  not allowed  during the study. 
Administration of other chemotherapy,  immunotherapy, or anti-tumor hormonal  therapy during the  study is not allowed. 
Supportive care, including but not limited to anti-emetic medications,  may be administered at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates is allowed.  Erythropoietin may be administered  at the discretion of the investigator,  
consistent with institutional guidelines. G-CSF should be administered according  to the institutional guidelines.
5.4.3 Drug Interaction
a- ABI-007
The potential drug-drug  interactions precautions  contained in the Abraxane  prescribing
information will be applied to this study  (current version of  Prescribing Information  is
provided in the Study Manual). Specifically, the metabolism of paclitaxel  is catalyzed by
[CONTACT_9058] P450  isozymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Caution  is recommended when
administering ABI-007 concomitantly with substrates or inhibitors of the cytochrome  
P450isozymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4.  Similarly, drugs, herbal preparations, and/or dietary
supplements known  to influence the expression  of CYP3A (eg, phenytoin, rifampin, St.
John’s wort, garlic supplements,  grapefruit juice) and/or CYP2C8 should be  used with
caution (see www.drug-interactions.com for a regularly updated list of drug interactions  with
cytochrome P450  isozymes).
The Abraxane prescribing  information also cautions for potential interactions between
paclitaxel, a substrate  of CYP3A4 and protease inhibitors (ritonavir,  saquinavir, indinavir,
and nelfinavir), which are substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 and have not been
evaluated in clinical trials.
Patients must be made  aware that the following medications are not allowed to be  taken
concomitantly with ABI-007 monotherapy: ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and
doxorubicin, as well as any taxane,  anthracycline, anti-cancer  drug or other investigational
study drug.
In clinical studies of ABI-007 performed  to date, no steroidal premedication to  reduce the
risk of hypersensitivity reactions  was necessary. No  steroidal premedication is  to be given to
patients except as described below. If the investigator chooses to premedicate with an 
anti-emetic/anti-nauseant to prevent nausea and vomiting, medications  such as Kytril  and/or 
Compazine are suggested.
Hypersensitivity to Taxol has been attributed primarily to  Cremophor® in the product, and is
not therefore expected with ABI-007.  However, if the patient  experiences  a typi[INVESTIGATOR_769590], lower back pain, and  chest tightness, he/she
should have their infusion  stopped immediately. In the unlikely event of a mild hypersensitivity reaction, 
premedication may be administered  using  the premedication regimen the institution typi[INVESTIGATOR_769591].  In the rare event of a severe  hypersensitivity reaction,  discontinue  
Abraxane. 
b-  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769592] a component of the protocol regimen (including those for common medical 
conditions) for up to one month pre and post dosing with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Concomitant  systemic  or 
local anti-cancer medications  or treatments are prohibited in this study while receiving  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769593]. 
Patients may not use any of the following  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_226]:
Any non-study anti-cancer agent  (investigational or non-investigational)
Any other investigational  agents
Any other (non-CA184024 related) CTLA-4 inhibitors or agonists

A- Clinical
Toxicity Assessments:  Toxicity  of treatment will be graded  as per  NCI common toxicity criteria for adverse events,  version  4.0.
Response Assessments: Patients will be evaluated for complete response,  partial response, stable or progressive  
disease every 8 weeks (+/- 7 days) from the start of  treatment until progressive  disease is documented. Tumor response 
to therapy in this study will be done  using immune-related response  criteria (irRC) which is a modified  version  of WHO criteria.
Responders and stable disease  patients  will continue  on study unless  they develop unacceptable toxicity. Progressive disease 
or unacceptable toxicity will be the criteria for discontinuation of treatment. Patients who have not had progression of their  
cancer should continue to be followed with regularly scheduled tumor assessments  with radiographic imaging until progressive 
disease is documented.
End of Study  (EOS)  Evaluation: Physical examination (including  vital signs: blood  pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_769595]), weight, performance  status, CBC/differential, platelet count, routine chemistry panel (must include  ALT and AST, 
alkaline phosphatase, LDH, total bilirubin, and creatinine), toxicity  assessment,  concomitant medications, CT scan, and tumor 
measurements will be performed within  [ADDRESS_1056047] 
come off study  for progression of disease, and restaging  with all scans has been completed prior  to the EOS  visit, the scans will

Adverse Event Resolution Follow-up: Any adverse event  (AE) that  started any time beginning from the time of the first dose of 
study drug and ending [ADDRESS_1056048] dose  of study  drug or EOS (whichever is later)  will be followed.
Follow-up  for disease  progression: Patients  who are discontinued from treatment in the absence  of disease progression (e.g. –
 patients removed  for unacceptable toxicity) will undergo repeat imaging and  tumor response  assessments every [ADDRESS_1056049] be clear documentation as to the compelling  reason(s)  for starting a new treatment  in

B- Laboratory
1- Evaluation of Molecular Biomarkers
Tumor biomarkers  will be studied  in an exploratory companion substudy to assess  prognostic
utility in identifying  responders and non-responders. Molecular  biomarkers will be assessed on 
archival paraffin-embedded (PE) tumor tissue  and blood of  patients entered into the trial who provide 
additional consent. 
These biomarkers  will include  known mutations associated with  melanoma may be  examined in  both 
tumor tissue and blood. The expression of molecular biomarkers such as SPARC and other  mRNA 
expression profiles  in PE tumor tissues will be assessed to determine its potential clinicopathological 
utility related  to treatment with ABI-007. The objective will be to assess  specific biomarkers that relate 
to treatment response  and disease outcome.  In addition, PE tissue sections will be obtained from  tumor biopsy for 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess SPARC and for molecular tumor biomarker  validation. 
Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC)
SPARC (also known  as osteonectin and BM40) is an  albumin-binding protein that is  overexpressed in 
over 70% of metastatic melanoma patients’ tumors and is  associated  with a poor prognosis.  
Albumin-binding proteins such as SPARC may play a role in the concentration of albumin-bound drugs, 
such as ABI-007,  in the area of the tumor, and may be partly responsible for the greater activity  of ABI-[ADDRESS_1056051] shown prognostic  utility
in monitoring  patients during treatment . Blood samples  will be used for monitoring  the immunologic 
status of the patients during the therapy  on this study. 
2- Immunologic evaluations:
Venous blood samples  will be collected  at baseline, week 6, week 12, then every 12  weeks thereafter.  During the maintenance  
phase, the venous  blood samples  will be drawn  prior to the administration of IV Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769596]. The 4 
green top blood samples will be used to isolate PBMC and plasma  for analysis  in the laboratory as correlates  of clinical 
response during the trial.  We will use the PBMC to track changes in major lymphocyte (T-cell and NK  cell) subsets to  determine  
how activated the CD4+, CD8+,  and regulatory T-cells  (Tregs)  change during treatment  and how this correlates to  
response.  The plasma  will be used  to monitor auto-antibody production using  a defined  set of auto-antigen targets  previously 
defined in earlier Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769597].  The plasma  will also be used to monitor  changes in pro-
inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines  (e.g., IL-1-beta,  IL-2, IL-4, IL-6,  IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF,  
and VEGF).  These will correlate eventually to clinical response. 
6.0 Pretreatment  evaluation
6.1 A complete history and physical, including  vital signs,  examination  (including height,  weight, and ECOG Performance 
Status) will be performed  within  [ADDRESS_1056052], ALT, LDH,  total bilirubin,  Mg, PT and PTT, and thyroid function tests 
(TSH, free T4) within [ADDRESS_1056053] scan of the neck  and pelvis,  respectively. For 
patients with significant extremity metastases (subcutaneous or other), MRI or CT of the relevant extremity is required.
6.[ADDRESS_1056054] pulmonary  function 
studies (FEV1  >65%  or FVC >65%) within  [ADDRESS_1056055] (blood or urine) will be performed within 72 hours of administrating  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. If indicated, an FSH will be 
performed.
6.7  Concomitant medications and baseline toxicities will be documented within 14  days of signing the informed consent  
document informed consent document 
6.8  Evaluation of Molecular Biomarkers
Patients with archival  paraffin-embedded (PE) tumor tissue will have optional tumor biomarker study to assess prognostic utility  
in identifying responders and non-responders.  These biomarkers  will include known mutations associated with melanoma. The  
objective will be to assess specific biomarkers  that relate to treatment response  and disease outcome. In addition, PE tissue  
sections will be obtained from tumor biopsy for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess  SPARC and for  molecular  tumor  
biomarker validation.  Participation  in tumor  biopsy and these tumor  specimen-based  molecular biomarker analyses is optional. 
In addition, we will attempt to evaluate blood  biomarkers such as SPARC that have shown  prognostic utility in  monitoring 
patients during treatment .
Optional Tumor  Biopsies
Optional punch biopsies  will be obtained from patients who have cutaneous lesions that are amenable to punch biopsies at two 
separate time-points.  Optional  biopsies  are addressed  in the consent and participants must have agreed to undergoing 
biopsies by [CONTACT_769644].  The first  optional biopsy will occur at baseline prior to 
treatment.  The second optional biopsy should  occur on cycle [ADDRESS_1056056] 5mm  deep into the tumor.  Half of  the tumor will be analyzed  
for flow cytometry  analysis and half for RNA isolation.      
6.9 Evaluation of immune  status: 
Optional blood sample will be collected  for evaluation of  immune status prior to start of therapy.

(serum or urine)  just prior to each cycle (+/-3 days). Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) are  done before each dose of 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769598] 3 months.  (+/- 3 days). Following the administration of therapy, patients will be  required to have a 
CBC, differential and platelets  weekly (+/- 3 days).  Weekly  lab tests may be done at an  outside facility.  The research nurse  or 
data coordinator will insure  that the results are received and reviewed.  Patients will be encouraged to bring a copy of the lab 
results to their clinic  visit, if possible.
7.4  The size of the tumor (either  in transit  or palpable) will be monitored closely  in order  to assess  response to 
treatment.  Physical measurements of the tumor will be done  by [CONTACT_62674] [INVESTIGATOR_769599] (+/- 3 days).  Repeat  CT  of the affected area will done after  8 weeks (+/-  7 days)  for assessment  of response. For 
patients with skin lesions, photographs  of the skin lesions will be done every [ADDRESS_1056059] scan of the brain  will be repeated every 2 cycles to  rule out the development of asymptomatic brain metastases. 
Thyroid function tests  (TSH, free T4) every 3 months.
7.5 Immunologic and molecular monitoring:  Venous blood samples will be collected for immunologic evaluation  and molecular 
monitoring before cycle 1, 3 and odd numbered cycles as optional procedure.   Not all optional samples may be collected at all 
time points and missed sample collections will not be  considered protocol deviations.   These will correlate eventually to clinical 
response.

8.0 Evaluation of response
8.1  Tumor  response to therapy in this study  will be done every 12  weeks (+/- 7 days) using  immune-related response criteria 
(irRC) which is a modified version  of WHO  criteria.
8.1.[ADDRESS_1056069] one diameter 
>20 mm and the other dimension  > 10 mm ([ADDRESS_1056070]). The area will be defined as the product of the largest 
diameter with its perpendicular.  Skin lesions can be considered  measurable.
Non-Measurable (evaluable) Lesions are all other lesions,  including unidimensionally  measurable disease and small  lesions 
(lesions without at least one diameter > 20 mm),  and any of the following:  
Lesions occurring  in a previously irradiated area (unless they are documented  as new lesions  since the completion of radiation 
therapy), bone lesions,  leptomeningeal disease,  ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion,  lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal  
masses that are not pathologically/cytologically confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_769645].
All measurable and non-measurable  lesions  should be measured at  screening and  at the defined tumor assessment  timepoints. 
Extra assessments  may be performed, as clinically indicated,  if there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_411335].
 8.1.2    Definition of Index/Non-Index Lesions
All measurable lesions,  up to a maximum of five lesions per organ  and ten lesions in total, should be identified  as index 
lesions to be measured and recorded  on the medical record at Screening.  The index  lesions should be representative of all  
involved organs. In addition, index lesions should be selected based  on their size (lesions with the longest diameters), their  
suitability for accurate repeat assessment by [CONTACT_15218],  and how representative they are of the patient’s tumor 
burden. At Screening,  a sum of the products  of diameters (SPD) for all index  lesions will be calculated and considered  the 
baseline sum of the products of diameters. Response criteria to  be followed are listed below. The baseline sum will be used as 
the reference point  to determine the objective  tumor  response of the index lesions  at tumor  assessment (TA).Measurable  
lesions, other than index lesions,  and all sites of non-measurable disease, will be identified as non-index lesions. Non-index 
lesions will be recorded on the medical record  and should be  evaluated at the same assessment  time points as the index 
lesions. In subsequent  assessments, non-index  lesions will be recorded as “stable or decreased disease,”  “absent,” or  
“progression.”
8.2  Definition of Tumor Response Using irRC
The sum of the products of diameters at tumor  assessment  using the immune-related response criteria (irRC)  for progressive  
disease incorporates the contribution of new measurable lesions.  Each net Percentage  Change in Tumor Burden per 
assessment using irRC criteria accounts for the size and growth  kinetics of both old and new lesions  as they appear.
8.2.1  Definition of Index Lesions  Response  Using irRC
irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all index lesions. This category encompasses  exactly the same 
subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_270336].
irPartial Response (irPR): Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the products of  the two largest 
perpendicular diameters of all index  and all new measurable  lesions (ie.,  Percentage  Change in Tumor Burden).  Note: the 
appearance of new measurable lesions is factored into the overall tumor  burden,  but does not automatically  qualify as 
progressive disease until the SPD increases  by >25% when compared to SPD at  nadir.
irStable Disease  (irSD): Does  not meet  criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence of progressive  disease.
irProgressive Disease (irPD): At least 25% increase Percentage Change in Tumor Burden (i.e., taking sum of the products  of 
all index lesions and any new lesions) when compared to SPD at nadir.
8.2.2  Definition of Non-Index Lesions  Response Using irRC
irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all non-index lesions. This category encompasses exactly the same  
subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_270336].
irPartial Response (irPR) or irStable  Disease  (irSD): non-index lesion(s)  are not considered  in the definition of PR,  these 
terms do not apply.
irProgressive Disease (irPD): Increases  in number or size of non-index lesion(s) does not constitute progressive disease 
unless/until the Percentage Change in Tumor Burden increases by 25% (i.e., the SPD at nadir  of the index lesions increases by 
[CONTACT_242839]).
8.2.[ADDRESS_1056071] from the study.
8.2.4   Definition of Overall Response Using irRC
Overall response using irRC will be based on these criteria:
Immune-Related Complete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all tumor lesions (index and non-index  together  
with no new measurable/unmeasurable lesions)  for at least  4 weeks from the date of  documentation of complete response. 
Immune-Related Partial Response (irPR): The sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular  diameters of  all index  
lesions is measured  and captured  as the SPD baseline.  At each subsequent tumor  assessment,  the sum of the products  of the 
two largest perpendicular diameters of all index  lesions  and of new measurable lesions  are added together to provide the 
Immune Response  Sum of Product Diameters  (irSPD). A decrease, relative to baseline  of the irSPD compared to the previous 
SPD baseline, of 50% or greater is considered an immune Partial  Response (irPR).  
Immune-Related Stable Disease (irSD): irSD is defined as the failure  to meet  criteria for immune complete  response or 
immune partial response, in the absence  of progressive disease.  
Immune-Related Progressive Disease  (irPD): It is recommended in difficult  cases to confirm  PD by [CONTACT_485373]. Any of  the 
following will constitute progressive disease:
At least 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index  lesions over baseline  SPD calculated for the index lesions.
At least a 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index  lesions and new measurable lesions (irSPD) over the baseline 
SPD calculated for the index lesions.

8.2.[ADDRESS_1056072] Overall  Response Using  irRC (irBOR)
irBOR is the best confirmed irRC overall response over the study  as a whole, recorded between the date of first dose until  the 
last tumor assessment before subsequent  therapy (except for local palliative  radiotherapy for painful  bone lesions) for the 
individual subject in the study.  For the assessment of irBOR, all available assessments  per subject  are considered.
irCR or irPR determinations included in the irBOR assessment must be confirmed  by a second  (confirmatory) evaluation 
meeting the criteria for response and performed  no less than [ADDRESS_1056073] 
objective volume increase  of tumor lesions or other disease  parameters (based on study indication, ie, hematologic  
malignancies) within [ADDRESS_1056074], up to and including follow-up  visits, will be reported. 
Safety will be evaluated  for all treated patients using the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse  event  reports and the results of vital 
sign measurements, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests.
ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING-BMS Reporting
9.1Collection of Safety Information
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward  medical occurrence  or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition  in 
a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an  investigational (medicinal) product  and that does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal  
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use of investigational product, whether or 
not considered related to the investigational product.
9.1.1 Serious Adverse Events
A serious  adverse  event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that  at any dose:  
Results in death  is life-threatening (defined  as an event in which the subject was at risk of death  at the time of the event;  it does 
not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death  if it were more  severe) requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769607] (see “note”  below for exceptions) results in persistent or  significant 
disability/incapacity is a congenital anomaly/birth defect is an important medical event  (defined as a medical event(s)  that may 
not be immediately life-threatening or result  in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_536891], based upon appropriate medical  and scientific  
judgment, may jeopardize the subject  or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical]  to prevent one of the other serious  
outcomes listed in the definition above.)  Examples of such events include,  but are not limited to, intensive treatment in  an 
emergency room or at home for allergic  bronchospasm; blood  dyscrasias or convulsions that do not  result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  Although overdose and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661],  these events should be reported 
on an SAE form and sent to Celgene  and BMS in an expedited manner.  An overdose  is defined  as the accidental  or intentional  
ingestion or infusion of any dose  of a product  that is considered both excessive and medically  important.
NOTE: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580421]:
a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769608] 24 hours that does not result  in admission  (unless  
considered an “important medical event”  or a life-threatening event) elective surgery, planned before signing  consent 
admissions as per protocol  for a planned medical/surgical procedure routine health assessment requiring admission for 
baseline/trending of health status (eg, routine  colonoscopy)  medical/surgical admission  for purpose other than remedying ill 
health state and was planned prior to entry  into the study.  Appropriate documentation  is required in these cases admission 
encountered for another life circumstance  that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical  intervention 
(eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, care-giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative).  Note  that all pregnancies,  
regardless of outcome,  must  be reported to BMS  on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form,  not an  SAE form (Appendix  G). All 
pregnancies must  be reported  and followed  to outcome,  including pregnancies that occur in  the female  partner of a male  study 
subject.
9.1.[ADDRESS_1056075]
All adverse events, including those that are serious, will be  graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity 
Criteria for Adverse  Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.0. The following categories  and definitions of causal  relationship to 
investigational product  as determined by a physician should be used  for adverse  events:
Certain: There is a reasonable causal  relationship  between  the investigational product and the AE. The  event responds  to 
withdrawal of investigational product  (dechallenge), and recurs with rechallenge  when  clinically feasible.  Probable: There  is a 
reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. The event responds to dechallenge. 
Rechallenge is not required.
Possible: There is reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. Dechallenge information is 
lacking or unclear. Not likely: There is a temporal relationship to investigational  product administration, but there is not a 
reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. Not Related: There is not a temporal  
relationship to investigational  product  administration (too early, or late, or investigational product  not taken), or  there is a 
reasonable causal relationship between non-investigational product, concurrent disease,  or circumstance and the AE.  The 
expression “reasonable  causal  relationship”  is meant to convey in general that there are facts  (eg, evidence  such as de-
challenge/re-challenge) or other arguments to suggest a positive  causal relationship.
9.3  Adverse events for this protocol will be recorded according  to the Recommended Adverse Event Recording  Guidelines for a 
Phase II protocol. The investigator is responsible for  verifying and providing  source documentation for all  adverse events  and 
assigning attribution for each event for all subjects  enrolled on the trial
9.4  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING -  
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Celgene-  Serious 
Adverse Event  Reporting
A serious  adverse  event is – any adverse  drug experience  occurring at any dose that results  in any of the following 
outcomes: 
·Death
·A life-threatening adverse drug experience  – any adverse  experience that places the patient, in the view of the initial 
reporter, at immediate risk of death  from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse  experience that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
A persistent or significant disability/incapacity – a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227334]  a serious  
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical  judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may  
require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes  listed in  this definition.  Examples of such medical  events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring  intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development  of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).
Important medical events as defined above, may also be  considered serious adverse  events. Any important  medical  
event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate  by [CONTACT_45822], Celgene or the IND 
Sponsor.
All events occurring during  the conduct  of a protocol and meeting the definition of  a SAE must be  reported to the IRB in 
accordance with the time frames and procedures outlined in “University of [LOCATION_007] M.  D. Anderson  Cancer  Center Institutional 
Review Board  Policy on Reporting  Serious Adverse Events”.  Unless stated otherwise  in the protocol, all  SAEs, expected or  
unexpected, must be reported  to the IRB office,  regardless of  attribution (within  5 working days  of knowledge of the event).
All life-threatening or fatal events, expected or unexpected, and regardless  of attribution  to the study drug, must  have a 
written report submitted within  24 hours (next working day) of knowledge of the event to Celgene  drug safety within  24 hours via 
email or fax using the information  below:

The MDACC “Internal SAE Report Form for Prompt Reporting” will be used for reporting to the  IRB office. 
Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs consent until [ADDRESS_1056077] returned to  baseline, progression  
of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of  the event.
Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after  the [ADDRESS_1056078] be 
reported to the IRB office. This may include  the development  of a secondary malignancy.
Reporting to FDA:
Serious adverse events will be forwarded  to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety Project Manager  in the IRB office)  according to 21 
CFR 312.32.
It is the responsibility  of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_769609], Good  Clinical  Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board 
policy.
9.4.[ADDRESS_1056079]. (In order to prevent reporting  bias,  subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more 
AEs.)
If known, the diagnosis  of the underlying  illness  or disorder should  be recorded, rather than its individual symptoms. The 
following information should  be captured for all AEs: onset, duration, intensity, seriousness,  relationship  to investigational 
product, action  taken, and treatment  required. If treatment for the AE was administered, it should be  recorded  in the medical 
record.
The investigator shall supply BMS  and Ethics  Committee with  any additional requested  information,  notably for  reported deaths 
of subjects.
9.4.[ADDRESS_1056080]’s  written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs must be collected, including those thought to be 
associated with protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs must be  collected that occur within  [ADDRESS_1056081] be collected  that relate to any later protocol-specified procedure  (eg, a 
follow-up skin biopsy).  The investigator  should  notify BMS of any  SAE occurring after  this time period that is believed  to be 
certainly, probably, or possibly related  to the investigational  product or protocol-specified  procedure.
All SAEs whether related or unrelated  to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], must be immediately reported to BMS (by [CONTACT_410349])  
within [ADDRESS_1056082] be kept on file at the study site.

For studies conducted  under an Investigator IND, any event that  is both serious  and unexpected must  be reported to the FDA 
as soon as possible  and, in no event,  later than 7 days  (death or life-threatening event) or 15 days (all other SAEs) after the 
investigator’s or institution’s  initial receipt  of the information. BMS will be provided with a simultaneous copy of all adverse  
events filed with the FDA. SAEs  that meet  the FDA reporting requirements should be reported  on the MedWatch Form 
3500A, which can be accessed at:  http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm167733.htm. Fax: 1-800-
FDA-0178 ([PHONE_176]) The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_769611].
Serious adverse events, whether  related  or unrelated to investigational product, must be  recorded on the designated SAE form 
and reported expeditiously to BMS (or designee) to comply with  regulatory requirements. An SAE report  should  be completed  
for any event where doubt exists  regarding  its status of  seriousness.  
All SAEs must be immediately reported  by [CONTACT_204188]  (fax) and  mailing of the completed SAE page. In 
some instances where a facsimile machine  is not available, overnight  express mail may be used. If  only limited information is 
initially available, follow-up  reports are required.  (Note: Follow-up  SAE reports should include the same  investigator term(s) 
initially reported.) In selected circumstances,  the protocol may specify conditions that require  additional telephone  reporting. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to the investigational  product,  but is  potentially related  to the conditions  of 
the study  (such as withdrawal of previous  therapy, or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should  be specified 
in the narrative section of the SAE page.
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to the investigational product, a follow-up SAE report should be sent 
immediately to the BMS. As follow-up information becomes available  it should be  sent immediately using the same procedure 
used for transmitting  the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be  followed to  resolution or stabilization.
9.4.3 Handling of Expedited Safety Reports
In accordance  with local regulations, BMS will notify investigators  of all SAEs that are  suspected (certainly,  probably, or  possibly 
related to the investigational product) and unexpected (ie, not previously  described in the Investigator Brochure).  In the 
European Union (EU),  an event  meeting these criteria is termed a Suspected,  Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R).  
investigator notification  of these events will be in the form of  an expedited safety  report (ESR). 
Other important  findings which  may be reported  by [CONTACT_460602]: increased frequency of a clinically significant  
expected SAE,  an SAE considered  associated with study  procedures that  could  modify the conduct of the study, lack of efficacy 
that poses  significant hazard to study subjects, clinically significant safety  finding  from a Non-clinical  (eg, animal) study,  
important safety recommendations from a study  data monitoring committee, or sponsor  decision to end or temporarily  halt a 
clinical study for safety  reasons.
Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain  the ESR with  the Investigator Brochure.  Where  
required by [CONTACT_769646] a central IRB/IEC for the study,  the sponsor  will submit the ESR to the appropriate 
IRB/IEC. The investigator  and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent  requires revision. The  investigator should also  
comply with the IRB/IEC  procedures  for reporting any other safety information. 
In addition, suspected serious  adverse  reactions (whether  expected or unexpected) shall be reported by [CONTACT_769647]  (either as expedited and/or in  aggregate 
reports).

Guidelines for the Follow-up of a Reported  Pregnancy.
Before study enrollment,  WOCBP must  be advised of the importance  of avoiding pregnancy during study participation  and the 
potential risk factors for an unintentional  pregnancy.  The subject  must sign an informed consent form  documenting this 
discussion.
All WOCBP MUST have  a negative  pregnancy test within  [ADDRESS_1056084] be 25 IU/L or equivalent  units  of HCG. If the pregnancy test  is positive, the 
subject must not receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769612].
In addition, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_769648] (e.g., missed  or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.
If, following initiation of the investigational  product, it is subsequently discovered that  a study subject  is pregnant or may have 
been pregnant at the time of investigational  product exposure, including during  at least [ADDRESS_1056085]  will be permanently discontinued in  an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary  for subject 
safety). The investigator must immediately notify  BMS of this event and record the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form (not an SAE form). Initial information  on a pregnancy must be reported immediately  to BMS, and the outcome information 
provided once the outcome is known. Completed Pregnancy Surveillance Forms must be forwarded to BMS  according to SAE 
reporting procedures.
Any pregnancy that occurs  in a female partner of a male  study participant  should be reported  to BMS, and Celgene.Information  
on this pregnancy  will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
Protocol-required procedures for study discontinuation and follow-up must  be performed  on the subject unless  contraindicated  
by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x-ray  studies).  Other  appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should  be considered if indicated. In 
addition, the investigator must report to BMS and to Celgene, and follow-up on information regarding the course of the 
pregnancy, including  perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1056086]. (In order to prevent reporting  bias,  subjects should not be questioned regarding  the specific  occurrence  of one or  
more AEs.)
If known, the diagnosis  of the underlying  illness  or disorder should  be recorded, rather than its individual symptoms. The 
following information should  be captured for all AEs: onset, duration, intensity, seriousness,  relationship  to investigational 
product, action  taken, and treatment  required. If treatment for the AE was administered, it should be  recorded  in the medical 
record.
10.0 Number of Patients
Simon’s minimax  two-stage design  will be used to perform  interim efficacy monitoring.   It is assumed that the combination 
treatment will have  a target PFS rate of 30%.  A PFS rate of  15% or lower is considered a failure  and the combination  treatment  
will be considered as not having desired efficacy.  With type I error of 0.05 and power  of 90%, we will enter [ADDRESS_1056087] stage.   If there are 6 or fewer patients  who are alive and progression  free at  month 6, then the trial  will be stopped and the 
combination treatment will not be considered for further  study.  If there are 7 or more patients who are alive and progression 
free at 6 months,  22 more patients will be enrolled and evaluated, giving us a total of 64 patients.  
Primary Endpoints:
The primary efficacy objective of the study is to determine if the combination  of ABI-007 plus Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769613].  The primary  efficacy endpoint is the rate of progression-free survival (PFS) 
at [ADDRESS_1056088] to follow-up  or who are not evaluable at 6 months  will be considered as failures  (i.e., disease  
progression occurred).    The 6-month PFS rate associated with the standard of care dacarbazine or temozolomide is about 
15%, and we will target a PFS rate of 30% in this study.
Rationale for the primary endpoint:
The main goal of systemic therapy is to achieve  complete remission when possible.   The greater is the tumor regression;  the 
better is palliation, improvement in quality of life and overall survival.   Thus,  it appears more  appealing to use overall survival 
rather than response rate to assess the efficacy  of systemic  therapy,  especially so with targeted  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_769614].  However,  since patient death 
is observed quite late, after use of multiple  regimens,  any effect of the first  line therapy has on  the overall  survival  may be 
altered by [CONTACT_769649][INVESTIGATOR_014].  The use of Progression Free survival (PFS)  to assess benefit  from an 
investigative agent makes the determination of the benefit from that  therapy more accurate than that observed from use  of 
overall survival. During the past couple  of years,  Meta-analysis of the outcomes of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_769615]  
(27) and colorectal (28) cancer were performed to determine if PFS is  a better surrogate for survival in patients with these  
tumors.  These studies  concluded that PFS indeed offers a direct measure of  new drug efficacy  that is not obscured by 
[CONTACT_70124][INVESTIGATOR_014].  It was postulated that, as more effective agents become available,  PFS will become  an even more 
desirable primary efficacy end point than overall  survival.  The advantage of  determining  the 6-month PFS rate rested in that 
ability to make early assessment of the agent in the trial, even if that agent showed  its effect at a slower pace than cytotoxic 
drugs, as is the case with many  targeted  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_769616].  Its use  will reduce the sample  size; shorten 
accrual time, and speed up the time of first analysis of  treatment outcome.
We will also monitor the safety of the ABI-007 plus Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769617].  Safety will  be measured.  We assume 
that response  and toxicity are independent.
Efficacy Monitoring:
Simon’s minimax  two-stage design  will be used to perform  interim efficacy monitoring.(29)   It is assumed that the combination 
treatment will have  a target PFS rate of 30%.  A PFS rate of  15% or lower is considered a failure  and the combination  treatment  
will be considered as not having desired efficacy.  With type I error of 0.05 and power  of 90%, we will enter [ADDRESS_1056089] been fully evaluated for the 6 months. Once a 7th patient has been  observed to be  alive and progression free at 6 
months, accrual  will be resumed. At the end of the study, if there  are more than 14 patients  who are alive and  progression free  
at 6 months  among  the 64 patients,  the ABI-007 plus Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_769618].  If there are 14 or fewer patients who are alive and progression free at 6 months,  then the 
combination will not be considered for future study.  The early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_337149] 55% if the PFS rate at 6 month is 15%.
Under the null hypothesis  that the progression-free survival  rate for the combination  treatment is 15%,  the trial will falsely  
conclude that it is effective 4.8%  of the time.  Under the alternative  hypothesis  that the progression-free survival rate  is 30%, the 
study will falsely conclude that the combination treatment does not work 9.97% of the time.
Safety Monitoring:
The method of Thall, Simon, and Estey  will be employed to perform interim safety  monitoring.(30)  We will assume a Beta (0.6, 
1.4) prior distribution  for the DLT rate on combination treatment,  which in  particular has  mean DLT rate  of 30%.  
The following decision criteria will be applied with minimum of 3 patients, cohort size of 1, up  to the 64th patient.   Targeting a 
30% DLT rate as a trade-off, the trial will be stopped early  according to the following monitoring rule.
Pr{DLT  rate > 30%| data} > 0.98
That is, if at any time during the study we determine that there is more than a 98% chance that the DLT rate in the combination  
treatment group is more than 30% we will stop the study.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_769619]

Statistical Analyses:
Descriptive statistics will be summarized for baseline characteristics of patients enrolled.  Treatment administration will be 
summarized for each treatment cycle.   Safety  variables will be  summarized by [CONTACT_9086].  Adverse events  and 
laboratory results will also be summarized in severity grade  (CTCAE).    
Tumor response will be evaluated based  on immune-related  response criteria (irRC) which is a modified  version  of WHO 
criteria.  Progression-free survival  will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.   It will be determined  from the start of the 
study until disease progression or death, whichever is first.  All patients  who do  not have  a disease progression  or death  will be 
censored on their last evaluable tumor assessment date.  The PFS rate at 6 month  will be provided with its 95% confidence  
interval estimated using bootstrap method.  Median PFS will be  reported together  with a two-sided 95% CI calculated using  the 
method of Brookmeyer  and Crowley.   Cox's proportional hazard model  will be used to determine the relationship  with PFS and 
the potential prognostic factors.  Exploratory  logistic regression  will be  used to identify the prognostic factors that are 
significantly correlated with PFS rate at 6 months.  
We will also calculate the disease  control rate (CR, PR, and stable disease)  at 6 months for all the patients,  together with  its 
95% confidence interval.  Again, logistic  regression will be used to determine the relationship between the disease  control and 
the potential prognostic factors.  Complete and partial tumor response rate as defined  in section 9.2  of the protocol  will also  be 
provided, together with their 95% confidence intervals.  
SPARC and Other Molecular Biomarkers
The correlation of SPARC  and other molecular  biomarkers with  efficacy outcomes  will be analyzed. 
Response duration and overall survival  will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier method. The duration of response is 
measured from the date of first documentation of objective response (either complete or partial  response, whichever is recorded 
first) to the date of first objective documentation of progression  of disease according  to the irRC criteria (taking as a reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since  protocol therapy was initiated).  The median and range of  
duration of response  will be presented for subjects with a complete  response, subjects with a partial response,  and subjects with 
an overall  response (i.e., confirmed complete  or partial response).  Overall  survival is defined as the duration from the start of 
the study  till death.  If a patient is still alive at the end of the study, this patient will be  censored on his  last follow-up 
date.  Median overall  survival will be reported with their 95% CI.  Cox’s  proportional hazard model will be  used to estimate  the 
relationship between  overall survival  and the same  set of covariates used  for PFS model.

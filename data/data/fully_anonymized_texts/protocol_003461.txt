 Protocol Summary
Title Cardiometabolic Biomarker improvements associated with reduction in air 
pollution exposure via home air filtration: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. 
Short Title Cleaner air for better cardiac biomarkers 
Brief Summary In this research, we will conduct a double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized 
trial to examine the impact on cardiometabolic biomarkers of air pollution 
exposure reduction using home portable air cleaners (PACs) in a cohort of 
current adult patients at NYU Langone Health. This study is funded by [CONTACT_337813] 
(NIH/NCATS UL1TR001445) with two primary aims and two 
secondary/exploratory aims. In Aim 1, we will evaluate associations with PAC 
use with a priori specified biomarker of inflammation, tumor necrosis factor 
ll determine if 4 weeks of home air filtration with PACs 
concentrations when measured before and after intervention. Blood samples 
will be collected from 44 study participants before and after 4 weeks of PAC 
use (true and sham) for biomarker concentration measurement. In Aim 2, we

-week period. In Exploratory Aim [ADDRESS_417417] importance in the 
physiological responses and clinical outcomes associated with air pollution 
exposure. In Exploratory Aim 2 , we will explore if biomarkers identified in 
Exploratory Aim 1 with significant reductions after 4 weeks of PAC partially 
mediate the association between reductions in PM 2.5and changes in daily 
home blood pressure (BP)  measurements. Participants will be given home 
BP monitors to transmit de-identified daily morning BP measurements to a 
secure database during the 4 week intervention period. Changes in morning 
systolic (BP) will be analyzed as the outcome of interest, with changes in 
biomarker concentrations evaluated as a mediator of the relations between 
pollution reduction and changes in BP.

mediate relationships with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension. 
Specific Aim 1: To determine if 4 weeks of home air filtration with PACs 
compared to sham is associated with significant reductions i
concentrations when measured before and after intervention.  
 
Specific Aim 2: To determine if reductions in PM 2.5 are associated with 
-week period. 
 
Exploratory Aim 1: To identify novel biomarkers of the cardiometabolic effects 
of PM 2.5exposure with PAC use with a targeted proteomic panel, the Olink 
Explore 384 Cardiometabolic panel, measured before and after 4 weeks of 
intervention. 
 
Exploratory Aim 2: To determine if novel biomarkers identified in Exploratory 
Aim 1 are mediators of the relationship between PAC use and home BP 
reductions after 4 weeks of PAC use. 
 
Methodology Randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_337795] 1 primary endpoint: 
 
Aim 2 primary endpoint: Change in indoor PM 2.5 concentration  
 
Exploratory Aim 1 primary endpoint: Change in concentration of 384 
circulating biomarkers associated with cardiometabolic risk  
 
Exploratory Aim 2 primary endpoint: Change in average AM systolic blood 
pressure over study period  
 
Study Duration 4 weeks 
Participant Duration Maximum: 4 weeks 
Population We will perform a randomized, double-blind, sham- controlled trial of continuous 
(24 hours/day) bedroom PAC use in an outpatient cohort English and Spanish 
medication changes in prior 
mm Hg without antihypertensive medications, or diagnosis of hypertension in 
medical records). Per guidelines, this range is considered safe to monitor 
without changes in antihypertensive medications. Additional inclusion criteria 
require participants to measure home blood pressure twice daily, participate in 
video conference for home equipment setup, and ability to visit clinic for blood 
draws before and after the study period. Participants will be excluded if they 
are current smokers, currently have known coronary artery disease, have 
known systemic inflammatory conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis, 
inflammatory bowel disease, cancer), or are currently taking any anti-
inflammatory medications or medications that target inflammatory cytokines. 
We aim to enroll 44 participants, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to PAC with HEPA 
filtration versus sham filtration.
Study number: s22-[ZIP_CODE] Page 3
Version: 2023.09/[ADDRESS_417419] (EHR) in NYU clinics. There will 
be 22 participants per arm (sham versus active filtration). 
Statistical Analysis For all Aims: descriptive summary statistics, such as mean and standard 
deviation (or median and inter quartile range) will be reported for continuous 
variables and counts and proportions for categorical variables. Graphical 
displays of all variables will be examined, with attention to assessing balance 
in these characteristics by [CONTACT_65237], and with assessment of the 
distribution of variables, relevant to the choice of statistical tests. Statistical 
comparisons between the PAC and sham groups will be performed using a 
two-group two-sided t-test or nonparametric Wilcoxon test for continuous 
variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Distributions of 
biomarker concentrations will be examined and non-normally distributed 
concentrations will be log-transformed, as needed.  
 
The analysis of our primary outcome for Aim [ADDRESS_417420] 
correlation between biomarker observations.  
 
For Aim 2, we will also utilize similar models incorporating PM 2.5as the 
independent variable. This will be assessed as the difference between pre-
intervention baseline PM 2.5concentration and the time-weighted average 
concentration of PM 2.5 from the 14-day intervention period.  
 
For Exploratory Aim 1 , we will evaluate the Olink panel results using mixed-
effects models for the remaining biomarkers that were not prespecified. 
These will be the same models as for Aims 1 and 2, adjusted for age, gender, 
and BMI. For Exploratory Aim 2 , we will evaluate associations of PAC use 
and PM 2.5 reduction with measured AM systolic blood pressure in this clinical 
cohort. We will perform mediation analysis using biomarkers with significant 
associations in Exploratory Aim 1 as mediators of the relations between PM 2.5 
reduction and change in blood pressure.

2 Introduction, Background Information and Scientific Rationale 
2.1 Background Information and Relevant Literature 
Fine particulate matter air pollution (PM 2.5) exposure is associated with 
increased blood pressure.1, 2Proposed mechanisms include increases in inflammation and oxidative 
stress leading to increased sympathetic tone and impaired vasomotor regulation.3, [ADDRESS_417424] identified 
gene expression changes in inflammatory pathways in association with increased particulate matter 
Study number: s22-[ZIP_CODE] Page 6
Version: 2023.09/07   
pollution.5 
inflammatory biomarkers.6-8Controlled human exposure studies show that exposure to air pollution 
9in vivoand in vitro
and remodeling linked with increases in blood pressure and the development of hypertension.10Given this 
 with fine particulate matter 
air pollution exposure.    
 
While it is clear that increases in PM 2.5exposure are associated with increases in inflammation, evidence 
is less well-established that reducing PM 2.5 exposure will reduce inflammation.  Natural experiments 
in Beijing during the 2008 Olympi[INVESTIGATOR_337798] 2.5due to regulations for the event were 
associated with reductions in concentrations of circulating inflammatory biomarkers compared to the 
months immediately before and after.11 There are also limited studies of reducing cardiovascular risk factors 
by [CONTACT_337814] (PACs). 
For example, in a meta-analysis of the effect of PAC use on blood pressure, our group showed a significant 
12
More recently, we also showed by [CONTACT_63700]-analysis that residential PAC use by [CONTACT_337815] (10 studies, total N=570) and IL-6 (9 studies, total N=379).13
In these studies, active PAC use was associated with statistically significant 7% lower CRP and 13% lower 
IL-
statistical significance (5 studies, N=215). Multiple biomarkers have data supporting their associations with 
air pollution exposure. For example, recent studies have shown that PM 2.5exposure was associated with 
significant changes in Angiopoetin-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1,14 and increased expression of CRP, IL-6, 
-1, fibrinogen, p-selectin.6-8PCSK9 is an important pharmacologic target that has been 
shown to increase in association with increased particulate matter exposure.15 Soluble platelet selectin (sP-
selectin) has been shown to increase with PM exposure; a small trial of [ADDRESS_417425] was filtered.17 The data from these studies support 
connections with exposure and biomarker outcomes, but there are limited data from few small studies 
describing associations with PAC use. Given the important role in cardiovascular disease, and data showing 
relationships with pollutant exposure, we will primarily evaluate cha
use versus sham; and also will explore associations with Angiopoetin-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, PCSK9, sP-
selectin, and BNP and other panel biomarkers. There is a dearth of data on how personal interventions 
to reduce air pollution exposure affect cardiometabolic biomarkers and how those may mediate 
relationships with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension.  To address this gap we have 
proposed a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_337799] 4 weeks of PAC use.  
2.2 Rationale
Because PAC use has been associated with decreases in concentrations of circulating CRP and IL-6, we 
hypothesize the following: (1) Among adults with hypertension recruited from an outpatient clinical setting, 
4 weeks of continuous home PAC use, compared with sham PACs, will be associated with decreased 
2.5 
from PAC use wil . 
2.3 Potential Risks & Benefits
2.3.1 Known Potential Risks 
This is a minimal risk study, with no physical risks associated with the study design. Potential minimal 
risks are as follows:  
 (1) Risk of PAC use:  In our published review of the effect of personal air cleaners (PACs) on blood 
pressure control, no risks were reported.[ADDRESS_417426] been used to generate “white noise” associated with 
improved sleep latency and duration in a variety of settings.  
Study number: s22-[ZIP_CODE] Page 7
Version: 2023.09/07   
(2) Risk of monitoring air pollution: There are no known risks to participants with monitoring the 
amount of air pollution exposure. At conclusion of the 3-month study, data on air pollution exposure 
will be provided to study participants. There is no risk to participants in ongoing air pollution exposure 
during this time interval. 
(3) Risk of blood collection. There are minimal risks associated with a standardized venipuncture for 
blood collection. These risks include pain, discomfort and superficial bleeding or bruising. All 
participants in the clinical cohort will provide consent for standard blood collection, in which these 
minimal risks will be described. For participants in the clinical cohort, up to <15 1 tablespoons and 
3% of a standard blood donation) of blood will be collected at the baseline visit and 4-week visit. The 
total amount of blood collected will be <30 mL for the main study. For participants opting into 
<50 mL for the 
entire study. This presents minimal risk to study participants.  
(4) Risk of monitoring home blood pressure and ambulatory blood pressure. There are no known 
direct risks to participants associated with the use of home blood pressure monitors are ambulatory 
monitors. These devices are routinely prescribed for self-monitoring and clinician-assisted decision 
making for hypertension. There is a potential risk of increased anxiety due to self-monitoring of blood 
pressure. Study coordinators will discuss any concerns regarding home blood pressure monitoring at 
video visit with study participants and will refer any concerns on recorded blood pressure values to 
participants’ managing physician.  
(5) Risk of discomfort with staff visualizing participants’ homes during video visit for equipment setup 
(6) Loss of time  related to study participation: to minimize this risk, staff will schedule video visits at 
participants’ preferred times, and coordinate 4-week intervention period to facilitate clinic visits at 
convenient times for participants.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_417427] potential risks through 
their participation in this study, study participants may also benefit from the study: study participants will 
receive and keep their own personal PAC and BP monitor, these may result in lasting improvements in 
participant health via continued air filtration or enhanced awareness of their BP. Participants will also 
receive a small remuneration for each blood draw.  
 
3 Objectives and Purpose 
3.1 Primary Objective
The primary objective of this research is to examine the effectiveness of PAC use in improving 
inflammation related to cardiovascular disease. 
Specific Aim 1: To determine if 4 weeks of home air filtration with PACs compared to sham is associated 
 
Specific Aim 2: To determine if reductions in PM 2.5as a continuous variable are associated with 
-week period. 
 
Exploratory Aim 1: To explore associations between PAC use and concentrations of cardiometabolic 
biomarkers using a targeted proteomic panel, the Olink Explore 384 Cardiometabolic panel, measured 
before and after 4 weeks of intervention.  
 
Study number: s22-[ZIP_CODE] Page 8

Exploratory Aim 2: To explore if changes 
partially mediate the effects of PACs on home blood pressure. 
[ADDRESS_417428] 
of PAC use on the concentrations of circulating biomarkers of inflammation in outpatient adults within the 
NYU Langone Health system.  
Aim 1: To determine if [ADDRESS_417429]-
intervention. The study design utilizes purposeful selection of 74 adults with stable hypertension within 
the NYU Langone heath system outpatient cohort. We will define stable hypertension as no medication 
changes in prior 30 
medications, or diagnosis of hypertension in medical records. Per guidelines, this range is considered 
safe to monitor without changes in antihypertensive medications. At the initial clinic visit, blood will be 
collected and stored for analysis. We will measure circulating concentrations of using the Olink 
Explore 384 Cardiometabolic panel for this a priori specified analysis; this panel will also measure the 
concentrations of other biomarkers that we will explore further in Exploratory Aims [ADDRESS_417430] high specificity and accuracy to 
allow for assessment of changes in concentrations between repeated samples over time.18, 19  
 
We will randomize participants to receive PAC with either true or sham filtration (HEPA filter removed). 
Equipment will be shipped to participant homes or given to participant at clinical visit along with written 
instructions for setup and use. Active and sham PACs, and pollution monitors, will be positioned in the 
bedroom where each participant sleeps. We will video conference with participants for initial setup of 
equipment, though prior data suggests that written instructions along are effective in aiding participants in 
this process. We will use a commercially available portable air cleaner with a “true HEPA” filter for the true 
arm. For the sham arm, the same model will be used with HEPA filter removed, and has identical 
appearance and sound. After enrollment and baseline blood draw, Home BP will be monitored using 
commercially available device with a paired data hub that transmits BP measurements to an online 
dashboard in real time. We will monitor participant adherence to PAC use with electricity consumption 
monitors. Participants will be scheduled for a clinic visit after [ADDRESS_417431]-treatment blood draw. 
A second blood draw will be performed and blood will be stored for analysis. Participants will receive 
reimbursement after equipment is returned and second blood draw is complete. Participants randomized 
to sham PAC arm will receive HEPA filters to install and keep.  
 
Aim 2: To determine if reductions in PM 2.5as a continuous variable are associated with significant 
-week period.  For Aim 2, the design is identical to above; 
however in addition, we will collect PM 2.[ADDRESS_417432] of PM as a continuous variable in addition to 
the binary variable of PAC use (active versus sham). Commercially available PM monitors will record 
indoor PM 2.5concentrations using dual (backup) sensors, which store measurements on internal SD 
cards. Commercially available PM sensors have been well validated and use laser particle counters to 
count the number of particles at varying sizes with a sampling frequency of [ADDRESS_417433]-intervention blood draw visit. These data 
will be measured for the entire cohort.

Exploratory Aim 1: To explore associations between PAC use and concentrations of 
cardiometabolic biomarkers using a targeted proteomic panel, the Olink Explore [ADDRESS_417434] FDA approval or diagnostic purposes. It will generate no 
clinically actionable results. The panel measures 369 protein biomarkers associated with cardiovascular 
and metabolic disease. This panel has been used to investigate cardiovascular disease treatment and 
prevention in various adult populations. 18, 19 18, 19 18,19 18, 19The pathways represented in the 
cardiometabolic panel include angiogenesis, cell activation, cell adhesion, coagulation, complement 
activation, extracellular matrix organization, response to hypoxia, and others. We will explore associations 
between PAC use (active vs. sham) and changes in circulating concentrations of Angiopoetin-1, ICAM-1, 
VCAM-1, PCSK9, sP-selectin, and BNP and other panel biomarkers. This Exploratory Aim will require no 
additional action on the part of participants.  
 
Exploratory Aim 2: To explore if changes in  
partially mediate the effects of PACs on home blood pressure.  For this Aim, participants will monitor 
blood pressure daily during the 4-week intervention period using commercially available BP monitor with 
a paired data hub that transmits BP measurements to an online dashboard in real time. Participants will 
receive written and verbal instructions for proper BP recording technique at the baseline visit. They will 
record two measurements in a seated position each morning and evening during the study periods. The 
outcome of interest will be the mean of two AM systolic blood pressure measures. We will perform 
mediation analysis to analyze the direct and indirect effects of changes in significant biomarkers and 
PM2.[ADDRESS_417435] of PAC use on AM systolic 
BP, we anticipate up to 30% missing BP measurements. We surveyed our prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_337800]; participants 
noted that they would have liked daily reminders. We will offer participants the option to receive daily text 
message reminders to record BP. These have been reported to be effective in other studies of home BP 
as well.

visit. Participants will meet with a research coordinator to review eligibility and provide informed 
consent. Informed consent will include specific language regarding laboratory testing for the Olink 
biomarker panel and a separate consent subsection for participation in providing samples for future 
research. Study discussion and consenting will occur following a clinic visit in a secure private location 
in either the outpatient clinics or Clinical and Translational Research Institute of NYU Medical Center. 
Participant will be randomized to true or sham arm of the trial and baseline blood draw will occur at this 
clinic visit. Blood will be collected and stored for analysis. Participants will receive partial reimbursement 
for the initial blood draw, and the remainder of remuneration will be giving at the final blood 
draw/equipment return. 
 
Inclusion of Women and Minorities: Women will be included as study participants (approximately 64% 
of enrolled participants). Minorities will also be included as study participants. Among NYU Langone 
Health outpatients, African Americans, Hispanic/Latinx, and Asian outpatients represent 16%, 17%, and 
5%, respectively, of the potential pool of study participants.  
5.4.1 Use of DataCore/Epic Information for Recruitment Purposes 
This study will utilize Epic to identify subjects. We will work with DataCore and NYU Medical Center 
EHR in NYU clinics. We will use 
SlicerDicer and other Epic tools to review EHR for eligibility. The team will request MCIT DataCore 
generate a report identifying potential subjects that meet criteria and have upcoming office visit 
appointments. The study team, including principal investigator, co-investigators, and research assistants, 
will have access to the EPIC search results and verify eligibility of potential subjects. 
 
Any recruitment information sent by [CONTACT_248701].  
 
Once potential subjects have been identified, the study team will notify the treating physician (TP) that 
they have patients eligible to participate as follow:  
 TP has been notified that the study team will contact [CONTACT_93578], by [CONTACT_31711], phone, 
email, or the MyChart portal etc. 
 
Once contact [CONTACT_58661], approved recruitment language will be used to communicate the reason they are 
being contact[CONTACT_118674]. 
Should the potential subjects agree, the study team will provide the subjects with information regarding 
the next steps for participation.  
 
If a subject requests information regarding opting out of further recruitment for all research, subjects will 
be directed to contact [EMAIL_6545] or [PHONE_7015].

6 Study Agent (Study drug, device, biologic, vaccine etc.) and/or 
Procedural Intervention  
This study will utilize a portable air cleaner as an intervention for the potential reduction of air pollution-
associated inflammation. This commercially available device has no significant risks. We plan to use a 
commercially available PAC with a “true HEPA” filter for the true arm. For the sham arm, the same model 
will be used with HEPA filter removed, and has identical appearance and sound. We will use a PAC 
designed to filter air in rooms up to approximately [ADDRESS_417444] setting.   
6.1 Study Agent(s) and Control Description
This study will utilize a sham PAC as a control. PAC will be delivered to participants as active or sham 
PAC in blinded fashion. The study team with receive the new devices and remove filters from sham 
PACs. Filters will be stored in our research office until the participant completes the protocol, at which 
time participants will return study equipment at receive filters to keep. Filter status indicator lights on the 
PAC will be covered with black electrical tape on all devices (active and sham) to preserve blinding.  
6.1.1 Acquisition 
PACs will be ordered online and delivered to the study team research office for preparation.  
Study number: s22-[ZIP_CODE] Page 13

The PACs will be run continuously (24 hours per day) in participants’ bedrooms for 4 weeks. 
7 Study Procedures and Schedule
7.1 Study Procedures/Evaluations 
7.1.1 Study Specific Procedures
History will be obtained via participant medical records and confirmed with questionnaire. Medical 
comorbidity information collected will include: history of hypertension, duration of hypertension, history of 
diabetes; history of inflammatory conditions including Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, vasculitides such as Kawasaki disease and giant cell arteritis, cancer and current status (no 
evidence of disease, ongoing treatment, cured, etc). We will also collect current prescription medications 
and assess for any planned medication changes during the study period. We will collect blood pressure, 
BMI and waist circumference at the initial visit. We will collect <15 mL of blood for evaluation of 
inflammatory biomarkers at both the initial visit and the final visit. An additional ~[ADDRESS_417446] circumference. Medication

8 Assessment of Safety
This study involves the use of commercially available products associated with no known risks to 
consumers. The Principle Investigator and Co-Investigator, Drs. Newman and Wittkopp, will monitor data 
safety of the overall study. We will review safety events related to blood pressure monitoring and blood 
draws at weekly team meetings with biweekly participant reviews complied by [CONTACT_95002]. Given 
the established safety of all commercially available equipment used in this protocol, there are no 
predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_17781] (no superiority/futility). After data safety assessments, study team 
will be notified via email of any changes in protocol.  
 
[ADDRESS_417451] of the 
trial follows the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), and with applicable regulatory requirement(s). 
This is a single-site study; data, training, procedures, and practices will be monitored continuously 
throughout the study period by [CONTACT_207009]. A quality management plan will be developed if needed.  
10 Statistical Considerations 
10.1 Statistical Hypotheses 
Aim 1: 
Hypothesis: Among adults with hypertension recruited from an outpatient clinical setting, 4 weeks of 
continuous home PAC use, compared with sham PACs, will be associated with decreased concentrations 
 
 
Aim 2: 
Hypothesis: Reductions in measured PM 2.5 from PAC use will be associated with decreased 
 
10.2 Analysis Datasets
These analyses will be conducted as Intention-to-Treat dataset. Per-Protocol Analysis will be explored if 
electricity monitor data indicates poor compliance with PAC usage (if electricity monitor recordings indicate 
kilowatt-hour usage that is lower than expected by 50%.   
10.[ADDRESS_417452] deviation (or median and inter quartile range) 
will be reported for continuous variables and counts and proportions for categorical variables. Graphical 
displays of all variables will be examined, with attention to assessing balance in these characteristics by 
[CONTACT_65237], and with assessment of the distribution of variables, relevant to the choice of statistical 
tests. Statistical comparisons between the PAC and sham groups will be performed using a two-group 
two-sided t-test or nonparametric Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and Chi-square test for 
Study number: s22-[ZIP_CODE] Page 16
Version: 2023.09/[ADDRESS_417453] correlation between 
biomarker observations. The proposed model is:  
 = +( )+()+ ( )+()+ 
We will also utilize similar models incorporating PM 2.5as the independent variable in place of PAC arm. 
This will be assessed as the difference between pre-intervention baseline PM 2.5concentration and the 
time-weighted average concentration of PM 2.5from the 14-day intervention period. For our exploratory 
aim we will evaluate the Olink panel results using mixed-effects models for the remaining biomarkers that 
were not prespecified. Additionally, we will explore associations of PAC use with measured blood 
pressure in this clinical cohort that likely differs from our current pi[INVESTIGATOR_337801] a community 
setting.  Because this pi[INVESTIGATOR_337802] R01 trial, for which blood pressure is the primary 
outcome of interest, we will incorporate this biomarker data into that trial for a secondary exploratory 
analysis of biomarkers as mediators in the association between PAC use and blood pressure reductions. 
 In our exploratory analysis, there will be multiple testing bias due to utilizing a panel of [ADDRESS_417454] adjustments for multiple testing are undertaken. However, we will use the Holm 
procedure to evaluate for significance. Overall, these exploratory analyses will be hypothesis-generating 
and can help inform the design and sample size of future cohorts. 
10.4 Sample Size  
Power Analysis : While we do not expect substantial participant dropout over this short trial, our power 
analyses include adjustment for up to 10% dropout in each arm. Based on our meta-analysis of 
biomarkers22, we estimate a 10% change in concentration of biomarkers with PAC use versus sham.13 13 
13 13 Using a basic multiple regression model incorporating age, BMI, and gender, along with our exposure 
(active PAC vs sham), we will have greater than 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of zero effect size 
at the significance level (alpha) of 0.05, with a sample size of 66. As such, our enrollment goal of [ADDRESS_417455], these results will still be informative for developi[INVESTIGATOR_337803]. We will include 
baseline-only data for participants who do not complete the protocol.  
10.5 Measures to Minimize Bias
10.5.1 Enrollment/Randomization/Masking Procedures 
We will block randomize participants for a net 1:[ADDRESS_417456] one unblinded PI [INVESTIGATOR_337804]; the remainder of the research staff will 
be blinded to each participant’s treatment arm until the final visit (at which time, those in the sham PAC 
arm will receive HEPA filters). The allocation sequence file will be securely stored in an internal NYU 
OneDrive in a password protected file to which only the unblinded PI [INVESTIGATOR_337805].  
PAC devices will be modified by [CONTACT_337819]/or unblinded PI; all PACs will have 
indicator lights covered, sham-PACs will have HEPA filters removed. PACs will be assigned a tracking ID 
number that will be printed on PACs, and PAC boxes. Blinded staff will only know the PAC ID number 
assigned to a participant but not the randomization of the device.

Unblinded research coordinator and PI [INVESTIGATOR_337806].   
Blood samples will be assigned to PCR plate locations using a random number generator. 
Data from PM monitors will be downloaded after participant has completed protocol. Research team 
members performing data processing of PM measurements will be blinded to PAC status of participant.  
11 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents 
Source data include all study-related forms, including: completed surveys, checklists, interview 
transcripts, consent forms, air monitor documentation, and study personnel tracking sheets.   
Access to study records will be limited to IRB-approved members of the study team. The investigator will 
permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201]/EC, the sponsor, government 
regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related 
documents. 
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832]. 
12 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
QC procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that will be 
run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the 
site(s) for clarification/resolution. 
Following written SOPs, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted, and data are generated, 
documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory 
requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)). 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and 
reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_90471].  
13 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects 
13.[ADDRESS_417457]
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be 
submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be 
obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and 
approval by [CONTACT_3484]. All changes to the consent form 
will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented participants 
need to be re-consented. 
13.3 Informed Consent Process
13.3.1 Consent/Assent and Other Informational Documents Provided to Participants 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting intervention. Forms 
Study number: s22-[ZIP_CODE] Page 18
Version: 2023.09/07 
contain all regulatory consent text/content. The following consent materials are submitted with this 
protocol: 
 
1. Consent for participation (including PAC use, pollution monitoring, BP monitoring and blood 
draws, and optional consent for blood collection/storage for future use)  
13.3.2 Consent Procedures and Documentation 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study 
and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible 
benefits of participation will be provided to the participants and their families. Consent forms will be IRB-
approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator will explain 
the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. All participants will receive 
a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential 
risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. Participants will have the opportunity to 
carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participants should have 
the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. 
The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically 
for the study. The participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial. A 
copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records. The 
rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_21223]. 
 
A copy of the signed informed consent document will be stored in the subject’s research record. The 
consent process, including the name [CONTACT_21811], will be thoroughly documented in 
the subject’s research record. Any alteration to the standard consent process (e.g. use of a translator, 
consent from a legally authorized representative, consent document presented orally, etc.) and the 
justification for such alteration will likewise be documented.  
13.[ADDRESS_417458] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
If a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to 
use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have 
revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at 
least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
 
This personal information will be retained, and all participants who enroll in the study will receive a unique 
study ID. Subsequent information will utilize this study ID instead of the participant’s name, and the key 
linking the study IDs and personal information will be retained on the secured server, accessible only to 
the study PIs, data manager, and field staff communicating with those participants. 
 
Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, and the 
sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples and 
genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participants. Therefore, the study protocol, 
documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information 
concerning the study, or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written 
approval of the sponsor.

remaining portion of blood samples from participants will be stored in a secured laboratory in the 
Cardiology Division Science Building Laboratories. 
 Intended Use: Samples and data collected under this protocol may be used to study additional 
pathways related to blood pressure and/or air pollution exposure.  
 Storage: Access to stored samples will be limited to the study team only. Samples and data will be 
stored using codes assigned by [CONTACT_473]. Data will be kept in password-protected 
computers. Only investigators will have access to the samples and data. 
 Tracking: Data will be tracked using internal tracking datasheets stored in password protected file 
on NYU internal OneDrive. Study PIs will have password.  
o Disposition at the completion of the study: All samples will be stored in in a secured 
laboratory in the Cardiology Division Science Building Laboratories. Study participants 
who request destruction of samples will be notified of compliance with such request and 
all supporting details will be maintained for tracking.  
13.[ADDRESS_417461] (for example, social 
security number, initials, or birth date). We will use freezer-safe labels and store samples in freezers with 
emergency backup power. The master list linking names to code numbers will be kept in a locked file 
cabinet, separate from all research information, under double lock and key. Only the NYU PI [INVESTIGATOR_337807]. All confidential data will be stored with a 
unique code as an identifier and will be protected by a double electronic lock. All physical data will be kept 
under double physical lock. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-Is will have access to the banked samples. 
Study number: s22-[ZIP_CODE] Page 20
Version: 2023.09/07 
Samples will be stored for no more than 20 years. The specimens for future analysis may be analyzed 
upon completion of the study for RNA, microRNA, and DNA. The blood specimens may be analyzed upon 
completion of the study for RNA, microRNA, and DNA profiling. This may include detailed molecular 
profile study, describing genetic arrays of patterns associated with cardiometabolic risk. We will not be 
performing whole genome sequencing, only genetic testing as it relates to cardiovascular risk described 
above. Because there is no potential for clinically actionable genetic incidental findings because of this 
testing, genetic information will not be disclosed to anyone, including the participants and their physicians. 
Samples could also be used for testing other potential biomarkers in patient plasma and/or serum related 
to diabetes and CVD that may occur with exception of those which are already part of the protocol. 
Results of the future research will not be shared with the subjects or their physician, and will not become 
part of the participants’ medical records.  
 
In the future, other institutions, or future collaborators at or outside of NYU Medical Center may want to 
study a portion of these samples. If that happens, samples would be sent to other places so other people 
interested in studying these diseases and conditions could do that. The samples sent to other 
researchers will be de-identified without PHI. Samples will be stored for no more than [ADDRESS_417462] may not withdraw his/her Authorization for uses or disclosures that have previously

14.1 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities
Data collection is the responsibility of the study staff at the site under the supervision of the site PIs. The 
investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data 
reported. 
 
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data. Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. When making changes or corrections, 
cross out the original entry with a single line, and initial and date the change. DO NOT ERASE, 
OVERWRITE, OR USE CORRECTION FLUID OR TAPE ON THE ORIGINAL. 
 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_58625] (eCRF) will be provided for use as source documents and maintained for 
recording data for each participant enrolled in the study. Data reported in the eCRF derived from source 
documents should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained 
and captured in a progress note and maintained in the participant’s official electronic study record. 
 
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and clinical 
laboratory data will be entered into RedCAP. The data system includes password protection and internal 
quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or 
inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents. 
 
For questionnaires confirming inclusion/exclusion criteria, data will be entered on an iPad with a data 
plan, provided by [CONTACT_337821], and stored using REDCap. No identifiable information will be entered or will 
be able to be accessed by [CONTACT_337822]. In addition, iPads with be programmed to limit access to only 
REDCap prior to data collection. Back-up paper forms will be used in the event of technology issues. 
After data cleaning and quality assurance procedures are completed, pertinent sets of data will be 
converted into SAS format for statistical analyses. Only authorized research staff will have access to the 
files.

destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor. 
14.3 Protocol Deviations
All deviations in protocol will be addressed in study source documents, reported to the NYULMC IRB.
14.4 Publication and Data Sharing Policy
This study will comply with the NIH Public Access Policy, which ensures that the public has access to the 
published results of NIH funded research. It requires scientists to submit final peer-reviewed journal 
manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed Central upon acceptance for 
publication. 
 
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a clinical 
trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research 
project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or concurrent comparison or control 
groups to study the cause-and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. 
Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process-of-care 
changes, and the like. Health outcomes include any biomedical or health-related measures obtained in 
patients or participants, including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. The ICMJE policy, and 
the Section [ADDRESS_417465] of 2007, requires that all clinical 
trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by [CONTACT_118702]. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies. For interventional 
clinical trials performed under NIH IC grants and cooperative agreements, it is the grantee’s responsibility 
to register the trial in an acceptable registry, so the research results may be considered for publication in 
ICMJE member journals. The ICMJE does not review specific studies to determine whether registration is 
necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have questions about the need to 
register err on the side of registration or consult the editorial office of the journal in which they wish to 
publish. 
 
FDAAA mandates that a "responsible party" (i.e., the sponsor or designated principal investigator) register 
and report results of certain "applicable clinical trials":

 Attachment B: Participant Instructions for Measuring Blood Pressure
 
Checking your blood pressure at home is an important part of this study and helps you know when 
your blood pressure is high.  Here is a quick guide on how to check your blood pressure at home.  
 
1. Please take two blood pressure readings 1 minute apart in the morning and two readings 1 minute apart 
in the evening for every day for 2 weeks (for a total of 4 per day, and 64 readings over the 2 weeks).  
 
2. Make sure the air plug of the blood pressure cuff is placed tight into the machine before taking your blood 
pressure. 
 
3. Remove tight-fitting clothing from the left upper arm.  
 
4. Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Put your left arm on a table or armrest so the cuff is about the 
same height as your heart. Sit for at least [ADDRESS_417479] the bottom of the blood pressure cuff about 1/[ADDRESS_417480] – it should run down the inside of your forearm and be in line with your middle finger 
(with the palm up). See next page for a diagram.   
 
6. Make sure that you are comfortable, and your left arm is not tense. Keep your left hand open.  
 
7. Press the Start/Stop button once with your other hand to take a measurement. You should feel the blood 
pressure cuff tighten when the blood pressure is being taken. Do not move or talk, and stay relaxed. Wait 
until the cuff deflates and your blood pressure is showing on the display. Once that has occurred, remove 
the blood pressure cuff.  
 
You can use this table to keep track of whether or not you have measured your blood pressure at these 
times (Example: place 2X’s under Day 1 AM after you’ve collected your two morning readings)

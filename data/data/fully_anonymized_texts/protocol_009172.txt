  1 Protocol Synopsis  
PREcision Event Monitoring of PatienTs with Heart Failure using HeartLogicTM     
(PREEMPT -HF) 
Study 
Objective(s) The goal of the PREEMPT -HF study is to collect device and clinical 
event data to evaluate extended applications of the HeartLogicTM Heart 
Failure Diagnostic (HeartLogic)  in a broad spectrum of heart failure (HF) 
patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)  or cardiac 
resynchronization therapy defibrillator ( CRT -D). There are no  primary 
safety and/or efficacy endpoints for this study.  
 
Subjects will be followed for approximately [ADDRESS_386179] the required number of  clinical events to  support the study 
objectives . These events are called Reviewable Clinical Events (RCEs), 
and include all -cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s and HF outpatient visits.  
 
Clinical event definitions are  as follows:   
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (all- cause) : the subject  is admitted to inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313678] a different calendar date.  
• HF Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : the subject  is admitted with 
signs/symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) and receives 
unscheduled augmented HF therapy with oral or intravenous 
medications, ultrafiltration therapy or other parenteral therapy.  
• HF R eadmission (30- day) : the subject is admitted for an 
unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313679] [ADDRESS_386180] 
discharge from  a HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• HF O utpatient V isit: the subject has signs/symptoms of CHF , 
and receives unscheduled intravenous decongestive therapy 
(e.g., IV diuretics, IV inotropes, IV vasoactive drugs, 
ultrafiltration) in a setting that does not involve a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(e.g., emer gency room, HF clinic, primary care clinic , etc. ). 
 
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the PREEMPT -HF study is to investigate the 
association between HF sensor data and 30- day HF readmissions.   
 
Additional Objectives  
1. Characterize HF sensor  data  for: 
o Association with risk for device VT/VF  therapy  
o Phenomappi[INVESTIGATOR_313680]  
o Association with non -HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313681] . Unauthorized  use is prohibited .

Method  The following statistical analyses will be used to evaluate the objectives 
of the study:  
 
Primary  Objective   
The difference in sensor trends pre- admission and post -discharge will be 
compared between subjects with and without a 30-day HF readmission. 
The comparison will be evaluated using a two -sample  t-test for each HF  
sensor measurement.  
 
Additional  Objective s 
1. Association with risk for  device VT/VF : will be evaluated using 
an odds ratio. 
2. Phenomappi[INVESTIGATOR_313684]:  will be evaluated using cluster 
analysis . 
3. Association with non- HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313685]-
HF events and non- cardiac events: will be evaluated using a 
paired t -test for each HF S ensor.  
Sample Size 
Parameters  Up to [ADDRESS_386188] 80% po wer to detect a standardized difference of 0.5 in the mean 
sensor change (admission – discharge) between the groups with and 
without a 30 -day HF readmission . It is expected that of the 215 -usable  
index (first during the study) HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 43 will be followed by 
a 30- day readmission (20%).  
 
Based on the following assumptions, a total of 215 usable index HF 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313686]:  
• 80% Power to detect a standardized mean difference of 0.5 
between groups  
• Two-sided Type I error (alpha) of 0.05 
• 3:1 ratio of group sizes (no- readmission: 30-day HF readmission), 
where the no -readmission group will exclude index HF

  3 Introduction 
3.1 Study  Rationale  and B ackground 
Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome with high morbidity, mortality, and 
economic burden1, 2. Chronic HF is persistent, gradually progressive, and punctuated by 
[CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_313688]3. Therefore,  there remains an unmet 
clinical need to slow the progression of HF and prevent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36651]. HeartLogicTM, 
available in [LOCATION_011] Scientific cardiac resynchronization therapy devices and defibrillators 
(CRT -Ds and ICDs), combines novel sensor parameters such as heart sounds and respi[INVESTIGATOR_313689], heart r ate, and activity into a HeartLogic 
Index for the early detection of worsening HF4, 5. However, there is limited data on the 
association of  HeartLogic with the risk of HF readmission s and tachyarrhythmia s, or for 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_313690] .   
Thus, t he goal of  the PREEMPT- HF study is to collect data aimed at extending Hear tLogic 
applications. Specific study objectives are listed below.  
(1) Associate HF sensor data with  HF 30- day readmission : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313691] -acute re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47144], 
which in turn has led payers t o impose financial penalties targeted at reducing 
readmissions while improving care quality6. Recent data from fee- for-service 
Medicare beneficiaries indicate that these incentives have reduced readmission rate; 
but, the magnitude of readmission reduction has been modest (from 23.5% in 2008 to 
21.4% in 2014), the rate of decline has slowed, and the mortality has not improved7. 
Readmission risk stratification algorithms developed to date have utilized clinical  and 
patient data8, 9. The ability to further reduce readmissions will require new 
approaches. For example, implantable  device diagnostics have been used to risk 
stratify HF patients for  readmissions10, and pulmonary artery pressure guided H F 
management has been associated with a 59% reduction in 30- day HF readmissions11. 
The PREEMPT- HF study will evaluate the novel HF sensor  parameters for 
readmission detection and patient risk stratification.  In order to evaluate the 
incremental  benefit of sensor data  for readmissions, only patients with HeartLogic 
disabled  will be included in the study. 
(2) Characterize HF sensor data for association with risk of tachy arrhythmias and 
device therapy: Acute HF exacerbations are presumed to trigger atrial and ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias through a number of mechanisms including increased cardiac filling 
pressure and neurohormonal activation12-15; however patient risk assessment  for 
malignant arrhythmias  is subjective and device sensor based algorithms for risk 
stratification  using traditional  device sensors have had only modest accuracy16-19. 
Similarly, a  new onset or worsening of atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmia may 
itself be a trigger for worsening of HF. The PREEMPT- HF study will investigate the 
association between the  HeartLogic Index and patient  risk for  device ventricular 
tachycardia/fibrillatio n (VT/VF)  therapy.

(3) Characterize HF sensor data for  phenomappi[INVESTIGATOR_313680]:  Clinical practitioners 
have recognized that HF is comprised of multiple heterogeneous entities  including 
HF with reduced, preserved, and mid- range ejection fraction (HFrEF, HFpE F, and 
HFmEF )20. Similarly, acute worsening HF has been classified by [CONTACT_313741] (wet/dry) and perfusion (warm/cold). However, 
physiological measurements underlyi ng clinical classifications exhibit significant 
variation. For example, even though the majority (>80%) of patients admitted for 
worsening HF show clinical signs or  sympto ms of volume overload, there is a wide  
distribution of body fluid and its composition21. Data driven approaches such as 
cluster analysis has been applied to phenotype HFrEF22 and HFpEF23, but continuous 
data collected by [CONTACT_313742]. The PREEMPT -HF study 
will collect data to investigate machine learning and clustering approaches for event 
classification using HF sensor  data and baseline clinical variables. This type of 
unbiased dense phenotype mappi[INVESTIGATOR_313692].  
(4) Characterize association of HF sensor data with  non- HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] : Due to 
aging and the convergence of cardiac disease and other comorbid conditions, 
approximately [ADDRESS_386197] heart sound; however additional data are needed in more specific event 
subgroups26. The interrelationship of HF with other disease states is underscored by 
[CONTACT_313743] a reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313693]27. Data from the 
PREEMPT- HF study will be used to further investigate the relation between diverse 
HF Sensor  measurements and non -HF related events.  
(5) Collect data on patient  sleep incline leading up to and following clinical events : 
Because orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea are hallmarks of worsening 
HF, devices with  HeartLogic are equipped with a Sleep Incline Sensor  to measure the 
subject’s night- time elevation ang le. A cross- sectional analysis of data from the 
MultiSENSE study (N=46 patients in 65 visits) showed that orthopnea symptoms 
were associated with increased sleep incline angle (mean±SEM  of 23.2±2.8 degrees 
vs. 10.7±1.7 degrees)28. The PREEMPT- HF study will extend this analysis to a 
longitudinal assessment of sensor measurements in the vicinity of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313694].  
(6) Investigate feasibility of linking study data to administrative claims : The capability to 
cost-effectively develop and test future device diagnostics may be dependent on the 
ability to link broad data sets, and validate knowledge obtained from multiple sources 
using data driven approaches, while ensuring the protection of patient privacy and 
data confidentiality29, 30. The utilization of claims data linked to remote monitoring

claims data with comprehensive device and other study data in applicable 
geographies. For example, in the [LOCATION_002] the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) has instituted an Innovator Research Program to allow

used are shown in Table 4-1, but future device models with the HeartLogic feature may also 
be included as they become commercially available. In addition, a Programmer Recorder

patient management system (or future versions ) and the PRM . LATITUDE is a remote 
monitoring system  (Figure 2)  that gather s data from the PG and external sensors (blood 
pressure monitor and weight  scale ) and transmits it to a web server.  LATITUDE enables 
physicians to remotely monitor both device and patient status.  The LATITUDE 
communicat or uses wireless telemetry to transfer data from  the implanted  device  and external 
sensors to the web server , which can be accessed by  [CONTACT_313744] .

Page [ADDRESS_386199] participation in the study, and data transmission via LATITUDE (i.e., referred to  as 
“monitored on LATITUDE” ) must be confirmed at the baseline visit . During the course of 
the study if the subject is away from the communicator, sensor data storage to PG memory 
will continue; however, the next data upload will not occur until the subjec t is within range 
of the communicator. To  ensure timely data transmission, LATITUDE must be programmed 
for scheduled follow -ups to occur every [ADDRESS_386200]’s device using the PRM. This will trigger a 
remote data upload to LATITUDE when the subject returns within range of the 
communicator. 
 
For the PREEMPT- HF study, H eart Failure S ensors must be turned O N. This must be done 
via the PRM. The Heart Failure Sensor s consists of heart sounds (S3 and S3/S1), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] 
(respi[INVESTIGATOR_313695]), impedance, heart rate and activity.  
 
Only subjects with Heart Failure Sensor s turned On, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_313696], and 
HeartLogic disabled are eligibl e to participate in the study.  The state where HeartLogic is not  
enabled on LATITUDE is referred to as HeartLogic disabled. In this state, the device will 
continue to collect sensor data, but the HeartLogic Index and Heart Sounds sensor trends will 
not be displayed on the LATITUDE system, and clinicians will not receive HeartLogic alerts. 
Sensor data will be stored in the PG for [ADDRESS_386201] be withdrawn from the study if Heart Failure Sensor s will be turned OFF, 
or if HeartLogic will be enabled . Subjects may remain in the study if the Respi[INVESTIGATOR_313697] ; however, this will be considered as a protocol 
deviation. The Sleep Incline Sensor  measures the subject’s a verage elevation angle over the 
programmed sleep schedule. Sleep schedule can be programmed using the PRM.  
 
Following device implant, the Sleep Incline Sensor requires a minimum of seven ( 7) days for 
initialization, after which sensor calibration must be performed. Initialization may take 
longer if subject  lacks diversity in his/her body orientations during this period. Calibration 
can be performed using a single -position method with the subject in upright posture, or a 
two-position method using both upright and supi[INVESTIGATOR_313698]. A two- position calibration is 
recommended when possible. During calibration, the s ubject must be  fully vertical or 
horizontal when the PRM captures the upright and supi[INVESTIGATOR_313699].  
 
The i mpedance and sleep incline trends will be visible on LATITUDE even when 
HeartLogic is disabled. Therefore,  information about the subject’s participation in a remote 
monitoring program using these sensors will be  collected at the end of the study and will be 
used for analysis.

(i.e., all -cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313700] ). Device data will be collected  using 
the LATITUDE remote monitoring system . However, it is critical to report  RCEs  via the 
eCRFs as defined in the study protocol .  
Prior to enrollment, patients who meet the eligibility criteria (Sections 7.2 and 7.3) and agree 
to participate in the study will be asked to sign a Subject  Informed Consent document 
approved by [CONTACT_3551] /Ethics Committee , or Competent Authority (as 
applicable per local regulations) . The f ollow -up schedule  for subjects is shown in Table 6- 1, 
and the overall study flow is shown in Figure 4.

Page [ADDRESS_386209] review is required at 6 months to capture study clinical events (see 
section 6 ). No subject visit is required . Accurate and comprehensive capture of RCEs is 
critical for the  success of the study. When possible, this medical record review should 
coincide with an in- clinic standard of care visit so that  the investigator can ask the subject 
about any RCEs that may have occurred since the last visit.   
During the final clinic visit (12 months or at the point of withdrawal), a device interrogation 
using the PRM must be performed. This ensures that  the device data will be uploaded  the 
next time the subject is in contact [CONTACT_313747].  Once the site has 
confirmed device data transfer  via LATITUDE , the end of study e CRF must be completed . 
There  will be no further data collection for that subject.  Individual subjects are then exited 
from the study , and the Heart Failure Sensor s and  feature can be programmed per clini cian 
discretion . 
6.1 Scale and Duration  
Up to 3750 subjects will be enrolled in [LOCATION_002], Canada, Europe, and Asia Pacific. 
Sites may continue to enroll subjects until notified of enrollment completion. The maximum 
enrollment ceiling per site is  375 subje cts. Enrollments are expected to occur over a period of 
approximately 60 months. Subjects enrolled in the study will be followed for approximately 
12 months. A patient can be in the study for up to 460 days (15 months) if the maximum visit 
windows are take n in to account. The study will be conducted at up to [ADDRESS_386210] Heart Failure Sensor s 
turned ON, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_313696], Sleep Incline Sensor turned ON , and HeartLogic 
disabled.  
6.4 Justification for the Study Design  
The results of the MultiSENSE study4 were based upon 400 subjects followed for 12 months 
(test cohort).  While this provided sufficient sample size to evaluate HeartLogic performance 
to predict the initial (index) HF event,  it was not sufficient for analyzing HF readmissions.  
Thus, a much larger sample size is needed to obtain sufficient numbers of subjects with HF 
readmissions.  To evaluate HeartLogic for HF readmissions, subjects cannot be treated by 
[CONTACT_313748], and clinicians must be blinded to HeartLogic Index and alerts. Therefore,  
this study will only enroll subjects who have HeartLogic disabled. D ata from this study will 
be used to evaluate the association of HF sensor  measurements with 30 -day HF readmissions.

  • Sleep Incline Sensor  calibration and data collection : 
*Important:  The device will NOT collect any Sleep Incline data until a body 
calibration has been performed. Calibration is a required step to ensure the PG is 
collecting sleep incline data.* 
o Sleep Incline Sensor  calibrations are performed by [CONTACT_313751] . Calibration should be performed using the two- position method for 
increased accuracy.  This requires the patient to sit and to lie down, so the 
calibration must be conducted in a room with adequate facilities.  Care must be 
taken to ensure that the subject is fully vertical or horizontal when the PRM 
captures the upright and supi[INVESTIGATOR_313698]. Once the patient is in position, the 
clinician will run the software on the PRM  for the data collection.  It takes 
approximately [ADDRESS_386222] .  
o If the Sleep Incline Sensor is turned ON, but the Sensor initialization is 
incomplete seven ( 7) days after implant, then calibration canno t be performed. 
Please document in the eCRF if initialization failure resulted in the inability to 
calibrate the sensor. If initialization failure occurs, calibration may be 
performed at a subsequent standard of care office visit.  
o Record the details of the sleep incline calibration in  the patient medical record 
as source documentation.    
• Provide subject with an ID card containing PREEMPT -HF study site contact

collected for the following:  
o Natriuretic peptides  (BNP or NT -proBNP)  and date of collection  
o Creatinine and date of collection  
• Indicate if the subject is implanted and monitored using a commercial pulmonary 
artery pressure sensor, or if the subject is monitored using serial natriuretic peptides .

9.[ADDRESS_386223] Review  [150-210 days ] 
The interim medical record review must be conducted [ADDRESS_386224] be 
asked whether he or she had any reviewable clinical events (RCEs) since the baseline visit. 
As defined in section 5.[ADDRESS_386225] reports having an RCE at a center not participating in the study, 
every effort  should be made to obtain medical records from the center. An overview of the 
activities and data to be collected is provided below.  
• Review  subject medical records since  the date of the baseline visit and assess for 
RCEs  and reportable AEs   
• If RCEs  are identified during the medical record review (see Figure 3 for details ), 
complete the “ Reviewable Clinical Event”  eCRF .  
o Each newly identified RCE  must have a unique eCRF. For example , if the 
subject had two HF outpatient vi sits for an on- going AE it must be 
captured in two separate “Reviewable Clinical Event” eCRF s. 
o If a single RCE is associated with multiple AEs, only the primary AE (i.e., 
the chief complaint leading to the  clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186]) should be 
associated with an  “Reviewable Clinical Event” eCRF . For example, if a 
subject was admitted due to symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding but 
developed worsening HF during the course of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , the 
gastrointestinal bleeding would be the primary AE, and therefore i t would 
be associated with the “Reviewable Clinical Event” eCRF . A separate 
“Reviewable Clinical Event” eCRF  is not required for the in -patient 
worsening of HF  even if  it is reported as  a separate AE.  
• For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_294214] r eview the patient’s medical 
records and classify the primary organ cause in the “Reviewable Clinical Event” 
eCRF  (see Appendix for details ). Appropriate classification is important for event 
subgroup analysis. Classification also triggers the request for medical record 
documentation to be sent to BSC.  
• Supplementary diagnostics data collection: This eCRF sub- folder is created only 
if the invest igational site confirms that the subject is routinely monitored using 
pulmonary artery (PA) pressure data from an implanted commercially -approved 
device, or using serial natriuretic peptides (BNP or NT -proBNP). If the site

9.9 Final Clinic Visit  [ 350-430 days ] 
The final visit must be performed in -clinic  350 to 430 days following the baseline visit. If 
the patient is withdrawn prior to the window for the final clinic visit, please complete the 
final clinic visit at the point of withdrawal.  An overview of the data to be collected at this 
visit is provided below. 
• Review subject medical records since the date of the baseline visit and assess for 
RCEs and reportable adverse events.   
o Collect and report using the same process used in the interim medical record 
review  (See section  9.8).   
• Physical assessment (See Appendix)  
• Blood labs: Ent er the most recent blood lab values since the baseline visit for the 
following.  
o Natriuretic peptides (BNP or NT -proBNP) and date of collection. If serial 
natriuretic peptide data has already been entered in the supplementary 
diagnostics form, the same val ues need not be entered in the final visit eCRF.  
o Creatinine and date of collection  
• Supplementary diagnostics data collection:   
o Collect using the same process as in the interim medical record review  (See 
section 9.8) . 
• Interrogate the device with a PRM . This ensures that the device data will be uploaded 
when the patient returns to within range of the communicator.  
• Confirm that a LATITUDE transmission occu rred in the previous [ADDRESS_386226] patient to do a patient initiated interrogation 
when they are in range of  their communicator.

  9.10  Study Completion  
An “End of Study” eCRF must be completed when the subject’s participation concludes for 
one of the  following reasons :  
• The subject completes the final in -clinic visit after 350 days (minimum final clinic 
visit window) . At this point, the subject will exit the study, and device settings can be 
configured per clinician discretion. The subject status will  be “ completed study.”  
• The subject withdraws from the study. At this point, the subject will exit the study, 
and device settings can be configured per clinician discretion, and the subject status 
will be “withdrawn”.   All applicable eCRFs ( including the F inal Clinic Visit if 
possible) and the “End of Study” eCRF must be completed with information up to the 
point of withdrawal . Complete a review of the medical records for RCEs to the point 
of withdrawal, and interrogate the PG (See section 9.9 for visit details). PG 
interrogation ensures that the device data will be uploaded  when the patient returns to 
within range of the communicator . 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_5756].  At this point, the subject will exit the 
study, and device settings can be configured per clinician discretion. The subject 
status will be “withdrawn.”

For e vent reporting the medical diagnosis mus t be reported. In case the diagnosis is not 
available, individual symptoms can be reported to fulfill reporting timelines. If a diagnosis 
becomes available at a later stage, it must be added to the reported event.  
If it is unclear whether or not an event f its one of the above categories, or if the event cannot 
be isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or 
device deficiency.  
Any AE event required by [CONTACT_760], experienced by [CONTACT_313760] (as defined in study subject classification 
section), whether during or subsequent to the procedure, must be recorded in the eCRF. 
Underlying diseases are not reported as AEs unless there is an increase in severity or 
frequency during the course of the investigation. Death should not be recorded as an AE, but 
should only be reflected as an outcome of one (1) specific SAE (see Table 17- 1 for AE

For purposes of the PREEMPT -HF Study, the [LOCATION_011] Scientific Pulse Generator (PG) will be 
referred to as the device under study.  Only device deficiencies related to the PG should be 
reported; no other PG manufacturers should be reported. When relevant and i f possible, the 
device (s) should be returned to BSC for analysis. Instructions for returning the device(s) will 
be provided as needed . Device deficiencies should also be documented in the subject’s 
source records. 
Device deficiencies are not necessarily adverse events. However, a  serious adverse event that 
results from a device deficiency  would be recorded as on the appropriate e CRF.

authorities of UADE s and SAE s as required by [CONTACT_5737] /regional regulations . 
BSC shall notify all participating Chinese study centers if SAEs/SADEs occur which imply a 
possible increase in the anticipated risk of the procedure or use of the device or if the 
occurrence of certain SAEs/SADEs demands changes to the protocol or the conduct of the 
study to  further minimize the u nanticipated risks.  
17.[ADDRESS_386256] be reported to [LOCATION_011] Scientific as soon as possible 
and, in any event, within three (3) calendar days of center  aware date. The center’s IRB/EC 
must be notified of any deaths in accordance with that center’s IRB/EC policies and 
procedures. Whenever possible, the device should be interrogated and BSC system 
components (e.g., the device) should be removed intact and returned pr omptly to BSC RM 
for analysis.  
A detailed narrative (death letter) that provides detailed information describing the

comparison between treatment groups where OKZ was administered for the full duration of the study versus treatment groups where initiation  of OKZ was delayed by 1 6 weeks.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Endpoints:  
Exposure to OKZ in plasma will be assessed as follows : 
• Blood samples for measurement of OKZ concentrat ions will be collected from all subjects periodically 
throughout the study, including each time a blood sample is taken for the determination of antidrug 
antibodies (ADAs) , with the exception of the final Follow -Up Visit.  Only samples collected from 
subjects receiving OKZ will be analyzed for OKZ concentrations in plasma .  Data for these subjects 
will be  included in a  future planned  population PK modeling.

Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  7 Confidential  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PD) Correlations:  
The PK/PD relationship and immunogenicity of OKZ will be assessed by:  
• Characterizing the dose/exposure- response relationships related to efficacy endpoints 
(e.g., ACR20  response) and identifying potential factors that may impact the efficacy endpoints  
• Characterizing the dose/exposure- response relationships related to safety endpoints (e.g., lipi[INVESTIGATOR_386504]) and identifying potential factors that may impact the safety endpoints  
• Evaluating the impact of ADAs on subject safety, efficacy, and PK of OKZ  
Exploratory Endpoints:  
• Exploratory pharmacogenetic (PG) assessments (in subjects who sign the separate PG  informed 
consent form [ ICF] only) to examine whether individual genetic variation in genes relating to drug 
metabolism, RA, and the drug target pathway confers a differential response to OKZ.  
• Exploratory biomarker assessments aiming to identify potential markers that are associated with 
treatment response to OKZ, correlated with the severity or progression of RA, or are cardiovascular 
(CV) surrogate biomarkers.  
Safety Endpoints:  
• The nature, incidence, severity, and outcome of adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs)  
• Proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities  
• Assessment of changes over time in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, and physical examination findings  
• Incidence and titer of ADAs to OKZ, incidence of neutralizing antibodies, and the time course of antibodies  
Methodology:  
The CREDO 3 study includes a 4 -week Screening Period, a double -blind Treatment Period from Week  0 to 
Week 24, and a S afety  Follow -Up Period from Week  24 to Week 44. 
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility to enter the study during a 4 -week Screening Period.  At randomization, 
a total of 350 eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 2 :2:1 ratio (140, 140, 
and 70 subjects  per group , respectively) : 
1. OKZ 64  mg q4w:  SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q4w (alternating with SC injection of placebo OKZ 
q4w to maintain blinding)  + MTX . 
2. OKZ 64  mg q2w:  SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q2w  + MTX . 
3. Placebo:  SC injection of placebo q2w  + MTX.  
Throughout the double -blind Treatment Period, all subjects will be required to remain on a stable dose of 
background MTX at 15  to 25 mg/week (or ≥ 10 mg/week if there is documented intolerance to higher doses) 
with a stable route of admin istration , and concomitant treatment with folic acid ≥5  mg per week or equivalent is 
required for all subjects .  Following Visit 2 ( randomization ), subjects will return to the study site at least every 
other week through Week [ADDRESS_484323] 20% in swollen and tender joint counts 
(66-68 joint  assessment ).  Starting at or as close as possible to Week 14, nonresponders wil l be administered

After completion of the 2 4-week , double -blind Treatment Period, subjects will either roll over into the 
long-term open -label extension (OLE) study or enter the S afety Follow -Up Period .  During the Safety 
Follow -Up Period, subjects will return for visits  +4, +8, and + [ADDRESS_484324] dose of study treatment  at 
Week  22 as per the S chedule of Events (Visits  SFU-1 [Week  26], SFU-2 [Week  30], and SFU-3 [Week  44], 
respectively).  
Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study (starting when the subject signs the ICF) and evaluated 
using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  
Subjects who discontinue the randomized treatment prematurely  will be required to come for the End  of 
Treatment (EoT) Visit [ADDRESS_484325] study treatment  administration and then continue with the  
scheduled study visits as per the Schedule of Event s. 
There will be ongoing monitoring of safety events, including laboratory findings, by [CONTACT_47399]’s designee.   In addition, safety will be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_386531] (DSMB).  
Planned number  of subjects:  A total of 350 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups in a 2:2:1 ratio (140, 140, and 70 subjects  per group , respectively) . 
Treatment population:  Subjects with moderately to severely active RA and an inadequate response to treatment with TNF i therapy . 
Diagnosis and  
main criteria for inclusion:  Male or female subjects ≥[ADDRESS_484326], dose and mode of administration:  Olokizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody  specific for 
interleukin -6 (IL-6). 
Subjects randomized to receive OKZ will be administered OKZ 64  mg via 
SC injection by [CONTACT_386532] q2w or q4w, depending on 
the randomization group . 
Reference therapy, dose, and mode of administration:  Placebo :  The placebo will contain  no active pharmaceutical ingredients .  
Subjects  randomized to the placebo group  will be administered placebo by 
[CONTACT_386533] q2w.  
To maintain the blind, subjects randomized to receive OKZ q4w will also 
receive placebo injectio ns at the alternate q4w interval (e.g., Week  2, 
Week  6, etc).  Placebo will be administered in blinded syringes with the 
same appearance as syringes containing OKZ . 
MTX :  Subjects in all 3  treatment groups  will continue their  concomitant 
background therapy (MTX) at a stable dose of 15  to 25 mg/week (or 
≥10 mg/week if there is documented intolerance to higher doses) with a 
stable route of administration (oral, SC, or intramuscular [ IM]). 
Statistical Methods: 
Calculation of Samp le Size  
Given that the study will be considered successful if at least 1  of the 2  OKZ dose regimens is shown to be 
efficacious and that a priori both OKZ dose regimens are assumed to be efficacious, disjunctive power (i.e., a 
probability of detecting a significant treatment effect for at least 1  OKZ treatment regimen)  will be used  as a 
criterion for the estimation of the sample size.  Sample size requirements are calculated to provide sufficient disjunctive power to evaluate the primary endpoint (superiorit y of OKZ relative to placebo with respect to 
ACR20  response rate at Week 12 ) and the first secondary endpoint (superiority of OKZ relative to placebo with 
respect to the proportion of subjects with DAS28 (CRP ) <3.2 at Week 12 ).  Sample size was estimated taking 
into account a multiplicity control procedure and the resulting α adjustment that will be used in this study  to 
control an overall Type  I error rate in the strong sense at a 1-sided  α = 0.025 across the primary and secondary

Olokizumab  
Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : [ADDRESS_484327] secondary endpoints are as follows.  
The ACR20  response rate at Week 12  for the placebo group  is estimated to be 20% in this study population.  
The OKZ ACR20  response rates for the [ADDRESS_484328] 45% and 50% , respectively, resulting in an expected difference in ACR20  response rates of [ADDRESS_484329] acebo.  
The DAS28  low disease activity (based on DAS28  [CRP] <3.2) response rate at Week 12  is estimated to be 5 % 
in the placebo group  and 18% and 21% in the OKZ [ADDRESS_484330] approximately 10% of subjects 
discontinuing randomized treatment prior to Week 12 .  In this study, subjects who discontinue prior to Week 
12 will be classified as nonresponders  for the primary endpoint of ACR20 at Week 12  and for the secondary 
endpoint of DAS28 (CRP ) <3.2 at Week 12 . 
The primary endpoint as well as the secondary endpoints that are binary in nature w ill be analyzed using a 
2×[ADDRESS_484331] for equality of proportions for each OKZ treatment group compared with placebo.   A 
continuity correction may be used if the expected cell count is <5.  
Based on the treatment effect assumptions and the methodolog y for estimating sample size via simulation to 
ensure sufficient disjunctive power as described above, a sample size of 350 subjects randomized in a 
2:2:1 ratio ( 140, 140, and 70 subjects  per group , respectively ) will yield 99% disjunctive power for testin g the 
primary hypothesis (ACR20 at Week 12 ) and 82% disjunctive power for the evaluation of the secondary 
endpoint of DAS28 (CRP) <3.2  rate at Week 12 . 
Analysis Populations  
• Intent -to-treat (ITT) population :  The ITT population will include all randomized subjects .  Subjects 
will be analyzed according to the treatment group  to which they were randomized .  The ITT 
population will be the primary analysis population.  
• Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT) population :  The mITT population will include all randomized 
subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study treatment .  Subjects will be analyzed according to the 
treatment group  to which they were randomized .  The mITT population , if sufficiently different from 
the ITT population  (>5% of ITT subjects excluded from m ITT across all treatment groups) , will be 
used for supportive analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
• Per Protocol (PP) population :  The PP population will include all ITT subjects who do not have any 
major protocol violations .  Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment group  to which they 
were randomized .  Major protocol violations and t he inclusion of subjects in the PP population will be 
finalized prior to study unblinding .  The PP population will be used for supportive analyses of the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
• Safety population :  The Safety population will include all subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study 
treatment .  Subjects in the S afety population will be analyzed according to the treatment the y actually 
received .  In addition  to the primary safety analysis the incidence of AEs will be analyzed separately 
for subjects administered an additional disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drug ( DMARD ) as rescue 
medication during the Treatment Period  and for  subjects who did not receive rescue medication . 
• Pharmacokinetics population :  The PK population will include all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_484332] 1 evaluable postdose O KZ concentration without important protocol 
deviations or events affecting the PK results .

Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  10 Confidential  Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted using the ITT population .  Supportive analyses of the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints will also be conducted using the mITT  (if sufficiently different from the ITT 
population) and PP  populations .  All comparisons for efficacy assessments up to Week 16 will be carried out 
based on study treatment groups  to which the subjects were originally randomized  at baseline .  For assessments 
at time points after Week 16, no statistical hypothesis testing will be performed and only descriptive summaries 
will be generated for treatment groups representing treatment sequences (i.e., OKZ 64 mg q4w, OKZ 64 mg q2w, placebo -  OKZ 64 mg q4w, and placebo -  OKZ 64 mg q2w).  
No adjustmen t for covariates will be included in the primary analysis of the primary endpoint or the analysis of 
the secondary and other endpoints that are binary in nature .  Analyses of the continuous efficacy endpoints will 
be adjusted for baseline values of the cor responding parameters.  
Endpoints that are binary in nature will be analyzed using a 2×[ADDRESS_484333] for equality of proportions .  A 
continuity correction may be used with the 2×[ADDRESS_484334] if the expected cell count is <5.  E ndpoints that 
are continuous in nature will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model and adjusted for 
the baseline value of the corresponding parameter.  
Other statistical methods and models will be used to investigate sensitivity to missing data and adheren ce to 
randomized treatment . 
Multiplicity Adjustment  
Each of the OKZ treatment groups  (64 mg q2w and 64 mg q4w) will be compared with placebo for each of the 
primary, secondary, and other endpoints  up to Week 12 .  The overall Type I error rate will be controlled for 
testing hypotheses of the primary and secondary endpoints at the overall 1 -sided  α = 0.025 . 
The α- control strategy will be based on using the Bonferroni adjustment for the tests related to each of the 
2 OKZ dose regimens versus placebo (i.e., using the 1 -sided  α = 0.0125 for each  OKZ  dose regimen) .  A 
gate-keepi[INVESTIGATOR_386505] .  In other words, ea ch OKZ dose regimen will be tested at 1 -sided  α = 0.0125 for a 
given endpoint if null hypotheses are rejected at 1-sided  α = 0.0125 for this dosing regimen for all previous 
endpoints based on the established order .  Conversely, the testing will stop for a given OKZ dose regimen at the 
endpoint for which the null hypothesis is accepted at 1 -sided  α = 0.0125.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Olokizumab concentrations  will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_386534] .  
Time to steady state  will be graphically evaluated for the OKZ trough data collected over the study period.   
Olokizumab concentrations from placebo subjects who are randomized to receive OKZ starting at Week 16 will 
be summarized separately and will not be part of the time to  steady state evaluation.   Pharmacokinetic 
relationships will be explored graphically and with linear or non -linear modeling approaches, as appropriate.  
Data collected in this study may be combined with data from other OKZ studies in support of population  PK 
analyses . 
Safety Analysis  
Major components for the safety analysis will include:  
• AEs will be solicited at every study visit, recorded, and coded according to the most recent version of 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). 
• SAEs  
• Vital signs and physical examination findings  
• Laboratory parameters  
• Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and other specialized test findings  
All AEs will be analyzed in terms of descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis .  Adverse events will be listed 
for each su bject and summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to the most 
recent  version of  the
 MedDRA .  In addition, summaries of AEs by [CONTACT_386535] .  All safety and tolerability data  recorded during the study will be listed and summarized by

Safety results will be summarized and presented with particular focus on safety concerns identified as AESIs , 
based either upon the safety data available to date for OKZ or drug class -related events for a biologic 
IL-[ADDRESS_484335] an increased risk of CV events .  To fully assess the CV risks associated 
with OKZ, the following approach  will be used : 
1. Potential major adverse cardiac events (MACE) will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_386536] ( CVAC ) according to a predefined charter .  The charter will define the 
criteria, data, and source documentation  required to adjudicate all MACE . 
2. Baseline CV risks including individual risk factors  (e.g., tobacco use, presence of hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus, and lipid profile ) will be assessed . 
3. Known CV risk factors will be monitored and assessed to detect any trends related to  long- term 
exposure.  
Safety Follow -up Assessments  
Given the long half -life of OKZ (approximately 31 days), all subjects will be followed up for approximately 
5 OKZ half -lives (i.e., 22  weeks) after the final dose of study treatment . 
Subjects who discontinue randomized treatment early (i.e., prior to Week 24) will adhere to the established 
double -blind Treatment Period visit schedule outlined in the study Schedule of Events, as if they were still 
receiving study treatment.  In addition, all subjects who discontinue treatment early will undergo  a full safety 
assessment at the Eo T Visit +[ADDRESS_484336] dose of study treatment  (OKZ or placebo) , as well as 
extended Safety Follow -Up assessments +4, +8, and +[ADDRESS_484337] scheduled dose of study treatment and not entering

Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  23 Confidential  2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Background  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune/inflammatory disease characterized by 
[CONTACT_386537], with synovial cell proliferatio n and destructive changes in bone and 
cartilage of multiple joints .  Untreated, RA can lead to destruction, deformation, and 
dysfunction of affected joints, which may result in significant morbidity, and accelerated mortality ( Jacobsson et al, 2007) .  Moderately to severely active RA is often treated with 
disease- modifying anti- rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), with methotrexate (MTX) being the 
most commonly used conventional DMARD (cDMARD) .  For patients  with an inadequate 
response  to cDMARDs, biologic agents (i.e., biologic DMARDs [bDMARDs]) are the next 
step, and include, but are not limited to, tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF -α) inhibitors (TNFi), 
interleukin -6 (IL -6) receptor (IL -6R) antagonists, and T -cell co -stimulation modulator s.  
Among these, TNFi, especially in combination with MTX, are used most often 
(Smolen  et al, 2014) .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_386507]/or bDMARD therapy, 
approximately 30% to 40% of patients  with established RA fail to respond and 50% to 60% 
of patients  fail to achieve a major clinical American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
response or good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response 
(Marchesoni  et al, 2009; Rubbert -Roth and Finckh, 2009; Cohen et al, 2008) .  Even among 
responders, the majority do not achieve remission.  T hus, there continues to be an unmet 
medical need for new therapeutic approaches in the RA patient population. 
One such therapeutic approach is to target  IL-[ADDRESS_484359] .  Interleukin- 6 is a pleiotropic, pro- inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety 
of cell types including lymphocytes, monocytes, a nd fibroblasts .  It is involved in multiple 
immunologic processes such as T -cell activation, B -cell proliferation, initiation of 
acute- phase response, stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell growth, differentiation and 
trafficking, as well as osteoclas t differentiation , which subsequently contributes to joint 
destruction.  D ue to the key role played by [CONTACT_8668] -6 in several RA mechanisms, targeting IL -6 is 
considered an attractive therapeutic option.  
2.2 Study Treatment  
2.2.1 Olokizumab  
Olokizumab (OKZ; CDP6038; L04041) is being developed by R -Pharm for the treatment of 
moderately to severely active RA .  Olokizumab was previously developed by 
[CONTACT_386538], and was transferred to R -Pharm for further global development. 
R-Pharm  
CL04041025:  Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 3  
Olokizumab  
Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  24 Confidential  Olokizumab is a humanized (complementarity determining region [CDR] -grafted) 
monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) of immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa isotype, developed as an 
antagonist of IL -[ADDRESS_484360] utility in a wide range of 
autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.  
Interleukin- 6 is a multifunctional cytokine that has been shown to play a central role in 
immune regulation, inflammation, hemopoiesis, and oncogenesis, and has been linked to a 
wide range of human diseases .  It is a glycoprotein of 184 amino acids that is produced by a 
wide range of cell types including monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, epi[INVESTIGATOR_386508], vascular endothelial cells, renal mesangial cells, glial cells, chondrocytes, 
T and B cells, and some tumor cells .  Stimuli of IL -6 production include TNF -α, 
lipopolysacchari des, and viral infections; inhibitors of IL -6 production include 
glucocorticoids .  Within the context of an immune and inflammatory response, IL -6 has been 
shown to exert a wide range of effects, such as those described below:  
• Induction of antibody product ion by B cells  
• Important role in the generation of a subpopulation of T -helper cells, Th17 cells, which 
may play an important pathogenic role in a number of autoimmune diseases  
• Key driver of the acute phase response (the increased production, mainly by [CONTACT_386539], of 
soluble factors, such as C -reactive protein [CRP] and serum amyloid A [SAA], during 
inflammation)  
In developi[INVESTIGATOR_386509] -6, potential therapeutic strategies include inhibition 
of nonsignaling IL-6R receptor alpha chain (gp80), which gives the IL -6 family members 
their specificity, and the IL-6R signal -transducing subunit (gp130) .  The identification of the 
optimum epi[INVESTIGATOR_386510] -6 (binding IL -6 in a region that is predicted to be involved 
with gp80 or gp130) was conducted using antibodies with similar affinities , but different 
binding axes, as determined by [CONTACT_386540] ( BIAcore ).  Antibodies directed 
against mouse or human IL -[ADDRESS_484361] under a range of conditions tested.

CL04041025:  Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 3  
Olokizumab  
Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : [ADDRESS_484362] commonly  used.  For patients with an inadequate response to 
cDMARDs, biologic agents that  inhibit TNF -α, especially in combination with MTX, are 
indicated ( Smolen et al, 2014).  Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of patients receiving 
biologics (i .e., approximately 40% to 50% of those receiving TNFi therapy ) have inadequate 
response to such treatment ( Marchesoni et al, 2009; Rubbert -Roth and Finckh, 2009; 
Cohen et  al, 2008).  Thus , there is an unmet need for new therapeutic approaches utilizing 
alternative modes of action in this patient population. 
Olokizumab is being developed to address the unmet needs of patients with these se vere, 
progressive, and debilitating disorders through a different therapeutic approach, utilizing an 
alternative mode of action .  Within the class of therapeutic antibodies targeting the 
IL-[ADDRESS_484363], OKZ is anticipated to be more potent because of its hig h affinity for IL -6 and 
its axis of intervention (inhibiting the interaction between IL -6 and gp130) .  Also, since OKZ 
is of the Ig G4 isotype, it would not be expected to mediate significant levels of antibody -mediated complement fixation or cell- mediated  cytotoxicity.  
Olokizumab is being developed for the treatment of RA to reduce signs and symptoms of disease, improve physical functioning, and induce higher levels of response .  The proposed 
indication for OKZ is to be used in combination with MTX for the  treatment of moderately to 
severely active RA in adult patients who have been inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_386541].   A separate study is planned to address the use of OKZ in a similar RA 
population who are inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_386542].  
Refer to the most recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure  for additional information on 
OKZ including:  
• In vitro activity  
• Nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) and product metabolism  
• Nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology  
• PK, efficacy, and safety profile in clinical studies

level (NOAEL) of 200 mg/kg/week and 50 mg/kg/week after intravenous ( IV) and 
subcutaneous ( SC) administration , respectively . 
In a study aimed at assessing the effects of OKZ  on prenatal and postnatal development in 
the cynomolgus monkey, the treatment was well tolerated du ring the pregnancy  and had no 
abortifacient effect .  However, some OKZ -treated females experienced dystocia and 
placental retention, sometimes associated with significant urogenital bleeding, which resulted in some deaths.  Given similar human and cynomolg us monkey physiology during pregnancy 
and the risk of dystocia and hemorrhage at parturition, inhibition of IL -6 signaling during 
pregnancy is not recommended.  
Taken together, the currently completed nonclinical studies support continued clinical 
developme nt for marketing approval of OKZ.  
2.2.3 Summary of Clinical Experience  
Nonclinical data were deemed sufficient to support clinical development of OKZ in humans 
for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA (lead indication), other auto -immune 
inflammatory diseases, and oncological diseases with IL -[ADDRESS_484366] been investigated in 3  Phase I clinical studies 
(RA0001, RA0010, and RA0074) and 2 Phase II clinical studies (RA0056 and RA0083) .  
The s afety and efficacy of OKZ were also studied in long -term open -label extension (OLE) 
studies for both Phase II studies (RA0057 and RA0089). 
The information in this section of the protocol regarding clinical studies with OKZ  is current

drug and 34 on placebo) with a 99- day follow -up. 
Study RA0010 
Study RA0010 was a Phase I/IIa study to characterize the PK/PD relationship between 
systemic OKZ exposure and CRP suppression, following single -dose IV and SC OKZ 
administration to subjects with RA and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single doses 
of OKZ in R A subjects over a therapeutic dose range (as defined by [CONTACT_386543]).  
Study RA0074 
Study RA0074 was a Phase I study in healthy Japanese subjects undertaken to evaluate the 
PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of SC OKZ prior to undertaking clinical studies  in Japanese 
subjects with RA.  
Studies  RA0056 and RA0057 
Study RA0056 was a Phase  II, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-  and 
active- controlled study of OKZ in 221 subjects in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and Europe with 
active RA who had previously failed TNFi therapy, administered SC at various doses and 
frequencies to evaluate the efficacy relative to placebo .  Eligible subjects were randomized to 
1 of 9  treatment groups :  OKZ 60  mg SC once every 2  weeks (q2w), OKZ 60 mg SC once

Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  28 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS] Summary of Safety Data from Olokizumab Studies  
Study RA0001 
There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during the study and no 
subject discontinued the study as a result of an adverse event (AE) .  The overall incidence of 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was slightly higher in the placebo group overall 
(18 subjects [52.9%]; 35 events) than in the OKZ treatment groups overall (11 subjects 
[33.3%]; 26 events) .  No increase in the incidence of TEAEs was observed with increasing 
dose of OKZ.  
The most commonly  reported TEAEs were in the system organ classes (SOCs ) of 
gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, general disorders, and infections and infestations .  The 
incidence of GI disorders was similar in both the OKZ group overall (12.1%) and the placebo group overall (11.8%); however, at the preferred term (PT) level, abdominal distension ([ADDRESS_484367] [3.0%]), abdominal pain ([ADDRESS_484368] [3.0%]), and vomiting (2 subjects [6.1%]) were 
only seen in the OKZ group.  T he most frequently reported TEAEs (occurring in ≥ 3% of 
subjects in any treatment group) by [CONTACT_386544] -like illness (11.8% placebo, 
6.1%  OKZ), headache (11.8% placebo, 3.0%  OKZ), nasopharyngitis (8.8% placebo, 
3.0%  OKZ), rhinitis (8.8% placebo, 0.0% OKZ), diarrhea (5.9% placebo, 3.0% OKZ), and 
vomiting (0.0% placebo, 6.1% OKZ).  
For the majority of hematology  and clinical chemistry parameters there were no clinically 
significant differences in mean actual values between the placebo group and OKZ treatment  
groups, and no clinically significant fluctuations in mean actual values over time. 
Study RA0010 
There were no deaths during Study RA0010.  T wo subjects ([ADDRESS_484369] in the placebo 
IV+MTX group and [ADDRESS_484370] in the OKZ 1  mg/kg SC+MTX group) experienced SAEs :  
Bowen ’s disease and worsening of RA, respectively .  Neither event was considered by [CONTACT_386545].  O ne subject in the placebo+MTX overall 
group withdrew from the study as a result of exacerbation of their RA .  All subjects (100%) 
in the placebo+MTX overall group and 96.7% of subjects in the OKZ+MTX overall group 
experienced at least 1  TEAE .  The incidence of TEAEs did not increase with increasing dose 
of OKZ+MTX administered ; although, a slightly higher number of AEs were experienced by 
[CONTACT_386546]  (1 mg/kg and  3 mg/kg) +MTX SC treatment groups 
(16 subjects  [94.12%]; 101 events) compared with the OKZ  (0.1 mg/kg and 1  mg/kg)  + MTX 
IV treatment groups (13 subjects [100%]; 54 events).

Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  29 Confidential  Study RA0074 
In Study RA0074, there were no deaths, SAEs, severe AEs, or AEs that led to 
discontinuation.  T he incidence of TEAEs was higher in the OKZ groups compared with the 
placebo group.  In the placebo group, 50% of subjects (2 of 4) had TEAEs (6  events), 
compared with 75% of subjects (3 of 4) in the OKZ 3 mg/kg treatment group (1 1 events), and 
100% of subjects (4 of 4) in each of the OKZ 0.3 mg/kg (16  events), OKZ 1  mg/kg 
(25 events), and OKZ 6 mg/kg (24  events) treatment groups .  The incidence of TEAEs did 
not appear to be related to the dose of OKZ administered.  
The most commonl y reported TEAEs were within the SOCs of general disorders and 
administration site conditions ; investigations ; GI disorders ; infections and infestations ; 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], thoracic and mediastinal disorders ; and skin and SC  tissue disorders .  Events 
occurring in >20% of subjects in the OKZ overall group, by [CONTACT_6214], included injection site 
hematoma (31.3%), abdominal pain (25.0%), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased 
(25.0%) .  The overall incidence of TEAEs in the OKZ -treated groups was higher than in the 
placebo -treated group, but given the small number of subjects in each treatment group, it is 
not possible to make any meaningful conclusions.  
In Studies  RA0001, RA0010, and RA0074, OKZ was tolerated at doses of up to 3 mg/kg SC 
(all studies), 6  mg/kg SC ( Study RA0074 only), and 10 mg/kg IV ( Study RA0001 only) .  
There were no deaths in any of these studies and only [ADDRESS_484371] 
in Study RA0010 discontinued the study early due to an AE (exacerbation of RA symptoms), but no subjects withdrew from Study RA0001 or Study RA0074 due to TEAEs. 
Study RA0056 
In Study RA0056, OKZ was well tolerated at doses of up to 240 mg q2w .  Serious AEs were 
reported by 6 subjects in the OKZ groups and 3 subjects in the placebo groups .  A total of 
11 subjects in the OKZ and placebo groups discontinued due to TEAEs ([ADDRESS_484372] in the placebo group ).  Overall, [ADDRESS_484373] subjects discontinuing due to 
TEA Es in the OKZ 60 mg q4w group (5 subjects [22.7%] compared with 2 subjects [10%] in 
the OKZ [ADDRESS_484374] [4.5%] in the OKZ 120 mg q2w group, and 2 subjects 
[8.7%] in the OKZ 240 mg q2w group) .  One subject (4.5%) in the placebo q2w group also 
discontinued due to TEAEs .  No TEAE PT leading to discontinuation was reported by [CONTACT_26813] [ADDRESS_484375] in any treatment group.  
Treatment -emergent AEs were reported by 17  subjects (77.3%) in the placebo q4w group, 
19 subjects (86.4%) in the placebo q2w group, 18 subjects (81.8%) in the OKZ 60 mg 
q4w group, 14 subjects (70.0%) in the OKZ 60 mg q2w group, 20 subjects (87.0%) in the

19 subjects each in the OKZ 240 mg q4w (86.4%) and OKZ 240 mg q2w (82.6%) groups .  
The majority of these TEAEs were reported during the T reatment P eriod.  
The most commonly reported TEAEs (>10% of subjects in any treatment group) in the 
OKZ  q4w, OKZ q2w, and placebo groups were in the SOCs of GI disorders, gene ral 
disorders and administration site conditions, infections and infestations, investigations, and 
nervous system disorders. 
The TEAEs that  occurred with the greatest incidence (i.e., occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects) in 
any OKZ treatment group included:   diarrhea, injection site reaction, injection site pruritus, 
nasopharyngitis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], urinary tract infection, ALT increased, 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, and liver function test (LFT) abnormal.  
When considering TEAEs by [CONTACT_386547] (CTCAE), the majority of subjects in all treatment groups ( ≥59.1%) had 
CTCAE Grade  [ADDRESS_484376] in the OKZ 60 mg q4w (4.5%) group who reported CTCAE Grade  3 TEAEs during 
the Safety Follow -Up Period .  No CTCAE Grade 4 or 5  TEAEs were observed in any 
treatment group .  There were no deaths reported in Study RA0056.  Overall, 6  subjects in the 
OKZ groups reported 7 SAEs (3  subjects [15.0%] reporting 3 events in the OKZ 60 mg q2w 
group [chest pain, basal cell carcin oma, and mania], [ADDRESS_484377] [4.5%] reporting 1 event in the 
OKZ 60  mg q4w group [LFT abnormal], and 2 subjects [9.1%] reporting 3  events in the 
OKZ 240 mg q4w group [pneumonia, perineal abscess, and back pain]) .  No subjects in the 
OKZ 120 mg q2w or q4w groups or in the OKZ 240 mg q2w group experienced SAEs .  A 
total of 3  subjects in the placebo treatment groups reported 3 SAEs (2  subjects [9.1%] 
reporting [ADDRESS_484378] [4.5%] reporting 1 event in the 
placebo q4w group).  
Of the SAEs reported in the OKZ groups, only LFT abnormal ([ADDRESS_484379] [4.5%] in the OKZ 60 mg q4w group) was judged to be related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_737] .  
Additionally, only the SAEs of LFT abnormal ([ADDRESS_484380] [4.5%] in the OKZ 60 mg q4w 
group), and chest pain ([ADDRESS_484381] [5.0%] in the OKZ 60 mg q2w group), led to 
discontinuation from the study .  All of the SAEs were reported as recovered/resolved with 
the exception of anemia ([ADDRESS_484382] [4.5%] in the placebo q4w group).

Three additional subjects experienced TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of OKZ  
(bladder cancer, palmar pustular dermatitis, and cholecystitis chronic) .  These subjects were 
not represented within the patient data sets or tables as this additional information was based 
on source documentation received from the respe ctive study  sites after the clinical datab ase 
had been locked.  
Treatment -emergent AEs were reported by 178 subjects ( 93.7%).  T he most commonly 
reported TEAEs (>10% of subjects) were in the SOCs of infections and infestations; musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders; GI disorders; investigations; general 
disorders and administration site conditions; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], thoracic a nd mediastinal disorders; 
skin and SC  tissue disorders; injury, poisoning and procedural complications; nervous system 
disorders; metabolism and nutrition disorders; and vascular disorders.  
When considering TEAEs by [CONTACT_3229], the majority of subjects had CTCAE Grade 1 (85.8%) and/or Grade 2  (56.3%) TEAEs.  At the SOC level, infections and 
infestations was the TEAE that occurred most frequently  (68.4% of subjects ), with a 
maximum intensity of mild (102  subjects  [53.7%] ; 239 events), moderate ([ADDRESS_484384] s 
[30.5%]; 103 events), and  severe (14  subjects [7.4%]; 17 events) .  At the PT  level, CTCAE

Study RA0010 
Preliminary efficacy data in terms of the Disease Activity Score 28 -joint Count 
(DAS28 ) (CRP) were obtained in Study RA0010.  An indication of the efficacy of  OKZ was 
obtained in the subpopulation of subjects with a baseline DAS28 (CRP) of >3.2 (i.e., those 
with moderate to high disease activity) .  Although the number of subjects falling into this 
moderate to high category was small, improvements in DAS28 (CRP)  were seen following 
OKZ+MTX administration, especially in the OKZ 1  mg/kg SC+MTX group.  
Study RA0056 
In Study RA0056, a greater improvement in least squares (LS) mean DAS28 (CRP) from 
baseline at Week  [ADDRESS_484399] improvement observed in the OKZ 240 mg q2w group.  
The overall dose -response trend (across the q4w and q2w dosing frequencies) was 
statistically significant (p<0.0001) .  Comparisons of dosing frequency (q2w versus q4w) and 
dose-by-dose frequency interactions (q2w trend versus q4w trend) were not statistically 
significant.  T he secondary efficacy variables were ACR  20% (ACR20), 50% (ACR50), and 
70% (ACR70) response criteria at Week  12 for the OKZ and placeb o treatment groups .  The 
ACR20  and ACR50 estimated response rates at Week  12 were higher in all OKZ treatment  
groups compared with the placebo groups .  Very few subjects in any treatment group were 
ACR70  responders; however, those subjects that were ACR70 responders were all in the 
OKZ treatment groups.  
Study RA0083 
In Study RA0083, a greater improvement in LS mean change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) 
at Week  [ADDRESS_484400] improvement observed in the OKZ 240 mg 4 -week 
cumulative dose group.  The overall dose -response trend (for the 4- week cumulative dose) 
was statistically significant (p<0.0001), as were the differences between each treatment  
group versus placebo (p<0.0001 for each treatment group) .  The comparisons of dosing 
frequency (OKZ  120 mg group [60 mg q2w versus 120 mg q4w] and OKZ 240 mg [120 mg 
q2w versus 240 mg q4w]), dosing frequency effect (q4w versus q2w dose frequency), and dose frequency interact ions (individual doses by [CONTACT_386553]) were not 
statistically significant.  The ACR20 and ACR50 estimated response rates at Week  12 were

treatment group of 120 mg q2w in Study RA0057.  The change in DAS28 (CRP) was 
summarized at Weeks  12, 24, and 48 relative to baseline (Week  0) in Study RA0056 and 
baseline in Study RA0057.  Relative to the Study RA0057 baseline, all treatment groups 
(excep t OKZ  60 mg q4w group at Week 12) showed a further decrease in DAS28 (CRP) at 
Week s 12, 24, and 48.  Subjects  switching from the placebo group in Study RA0056 to 
treatment w ith OKZ 120 mg q2w in Study RA0057 showed a marked improvement in 
DAS28  (CRP), simi lar to the improvement shown by [CONTACT_386554]0056 study .  The ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response criteria were summarized 
at Week s 0, 12, 24, and 48.  Relative to the Study RA0056 baseline, a  clinically relevant 
proportion of subjects achieved  ACR20  at Week  24 across all the treatment groups, ranging 
from 30 .0% of subjects in the OKZ  240 mg  q4w group to 66.7% of subjects in the OKZ  
240 mg q2w group.  Fewer subjects achieved  ACR50  at Week  24, ranging from 11.8% to

All treatment groups described in Study RA0089 belong to Study RA0083, from which the 
subjects were tr ansferred to a single treatment group of 120 mg q2w in Study RA0089.  The 
baseline values in Study  RA0089 corresponded to the baseline values from Study  RA0083, 
and the Week  0 values in Study RA0089 corresponded to the Week 12 values from 
Study  RA0083.  Th e change in DAS28  (CRP) was summarized at Weeks 12, 24, and 
48 relative to baseline (Week  0) in Study RA0083 and baseline in Study RA0089.  Relative 
to the Study RA0089 baseline, all treatment groups showed a notable decrease in 
DAS28  (CRP) at Week s 12, 24, and 48.  Subjects assigned to placebo in 
Study  RA0083 showed marked improvements in all parameters of disease activity after they 
began therapy with OKZ  in Study  RA0089, with an improvement in DAS28 (CRP) similar to 
the improvement shown by [CONTACT_386555]0083 study .  The 
ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response criteria were summarized at Week s 0, 12, 24, and 48.  
Relative to the Study RA0083 baseline, a  clinically relevant propor tion of subjects achieved  
ACR20  at Week  24 across all the treatment groups, ranging from 46.7% of subjects in the 
OKZ  120 mg  q4w treatment group to  81.8% in OKZ  240 mg  q4w treatment group.  Fewer

[IP_ADDRESS] Summary of Pharmacokinetic  Data from Olokizumab Studies  
Studies RA0001, RA0010, and RA0056 
Single dose PK of OKZ were studied in Studies RA0001 (healthy non- Asian), 
RA0074 (healthy Japanese), and RA0010 (subjects with RA) .  Sparse sampling following 
repeated administration of OKZ was performed in non-Asian and Asian subjects with RA in 
Studies RA0056 and RA0083, respectively .  Expos ure to OKZ following single dose 
administration appeared to be similar in non- Asian and Asian volunteers .  Following SC 
administration, maximum plasma concentrations were generally reached between 
approximately 4  days (in Study RA0074, 6 mg/kg SC) and 14 days (in Study RA0001, 
1 mg/kg SC) .  Over the 0.3 to 6 mg/kg SC dose range evaluated in Studies RA0001 and 
RA0074, the median terminal half -life ranged from 30.1 to 39.6 days .  The PK profile of 
OKZ in Study RA0010 (non- Asian RA volunteers) was similar to that seen in healthy 
volunteers in Study RA0001 for the same doses .  The maximum concentration of OKZ 
following SC administration was achieved within a median of 7  to 13 days following 
3 mg/kg and 1  mg/kg dosing, respect ively .  The estimate of terminal half -life across doses 
and routes of administration was 31 days (median range:   12 to 63 days).  
Pharmacokinetic bioavailability of OKZ via SC administration was estimated to be 63% across the 3  studies evaluated ( Studies RA 0001, RA0010, and RA0056) .  Population PK 
analysis utilizing sparse plasma concentration versus time data collected in RA0056  along 
with intense PK data collected in Studies RA0001 and RA0010 indicated similar PK characteristics of OKZ in subjects with mod erately to severely active RA and in healthy 
subjects .  Body weight was found to be the only “statistically significant” covariate on 
volume of distribution.  
2.2.4 Rationale for Dose Selection  
The dose regimens of OKZ to be evaluated in this Phase III study are 64 mg q2w and 64 mg q4w.  The rationale for selecting these dose regimens for further investigation is provided 
below. 
In the Phase II studies , RA0056 and RA0083, the primary efficacy variable was met in all 
OKZ treatment groups, demonstrating improvement compared with placebo groups and a 
statistically significant overall dose -response trend as evidenced by [CONTACT_386556]28 (CRP ).  Study RA0001 demonstrated that OKZ was pharmacologically active at 
all doses tested .  This finding was supported by [CONTACT_386557] 
R-Pharm  
CL04041025:  Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 3  
Olokizumab  
Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  38 Confidential  subsequent Phase I/IIa study , RA0010, conducted in subjects with mild to moderate RA .  The 
data from  these studies highlight the potency of OKZ as well as the existence of 
dose-response dependence, shown by [CONTACT_386558] .  The relatively flat concentration -effect relationship for 
safety outcomes and the dose -dependent occurrence of injection site reactions for the 
OKZ  [ADDRESS_484402] efficacy gains versus the 120 mg dose 
regimens, led to the exclusion of the 240 mg dose regimen from further evaluation in the 
Phase III program .  This decision was further supported by [CONTACT_386559] 2 injections of 120 mg OKZ in order to achieve the 240 mg dose level even 
with the new 160 mg/m L formulation . 
In a thorough dose -response analysis using the combined database from the [ADDRESS_484403] slightly lower efficacy in the modeling 
analysis ; however , in both Phase II studies that were conducted in relatively difficult to treat 
population of subjects  resistant to 1 or more TNFi biologics, the 60 mg monthly treatment  
groups showed statistically significant efficacy .  While there was not a detectable inc rease in 
safety events observed with doses above 120 mg monthly, there also did not seem to be a 
substantial gain in efficacy with higher doses .  Thus, the 120 mg monthly dose, administered 
as either 60  mg q2w  or 120 mg q4w , seemed to be associated with optimal efficacy/safety 
ratio.  The lower [ADDRESS_484404] volume that  can be used in Phase III (0.4 mL) results in a nominal 
dose of 64 mg rather than 60 mg . 
Consequently, using the primary efficacy outcomes from individual Phase II studies, and additional dose -response analysis performed on a combined database derived from these 
studies, 2 OKZ dose regimens were selected for further investigation :  [ADDRESS_484405] responded inadequately to TNFi

Due to the nature of RA and the outcome measures used (ACR response and DAS), a 
placebo group is necessary to obtain a reliable assessment of efficacy.  The inclusion of a placebo group and the duration of placebo treatment  are in accordance with health au thority 
guidelines.  Due to the availability of multiple treatment options for RA,  all subjects 
identified as nonresponder s at Week 14, including those receiving  placebo , will receive 
rescue medication starting  at or as close as possible to Week 1 4 (see Se ction 6.13.3).  In 
addition, all subjects receiving placebo will be randomized to receive active treatment (OKZ  64 mg q2w or OKZ 64 mg q4w) starting at Week 16 and continuing for the remainder 
of the double -blind Treatment Period.  The inclusion of a control group with non- active 
treatment (placebo) is also justified because subjects will continue to receive their prior background therapy (MTX) during the study.  Up to 30% of placebo  subjects may still 
continue to demonstrate increasing therapeutic benefit over 6 months of MTX therapy at the 
same dose ( Keystone et al, 2004).  
2.4 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Olokizumab has undergone extensive nonclinical testing , and [ADDRESS_484407] been 
completed.   In the difficult -to-treat population of RA patients who previously failed TNFi 
therapy, OKZ has demonstrated efficacy in 2 Phase II stud ies (Study RA0056 [ extended with 
Study RA0057]  in 221 subjects and Study RA0083 [ extended with Study RA0089]  in 
119 Asian subjects)  using the doses of OKZ that are proposed for this Phase III study; at 
higher doses, the safety profile was similar .  Bioavailability of OKZ via SC administration 
was estimated to be 63% across 3  studies evaluated (RA0056, RA0001, and RA0010) . 
The clinical program to date suggests that OKZ is effective in reducing disease symptoms in subjects with RA, and that OKZ is generally well tolerated (f or further efficacy and safety 
information , refer to the most recent version of  the Investigator’s Brochure ).  The safety 
profile of OKZ is consistent with the known effects of IL -6 blockers.  Overall, the 
benefit/risk profile for subjects in the proposed study is favorable.  The study will provide  
valuable information on the efficac y, safety, tolerability , and PK  of OKZ in subjects with 
RA, which may subsequently help to address  the unmet medical needs for this patient 
population. 
The design of this study contains adequate measures to mitigate risk factors and adequate 
safety monitor ing to protect the subjects.  Nonresponders at Week 14, defined as all subjects 
who do not improve by [CONTACT_2669] 20% in both swollen joint counts (SJC) and tender joint 
counts (TJC)  (66-68 joint  assessment ), will receive rescue medication (sulfasalazine and/or

Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  44 Confidential  • Blood samples for measurement of OKZ concentrat ions will be collected from all 
subjects periodically throughout the study, including each time a blood sample is 
collected  for the determination of antidrug antibodies ( ADAs ), with the exception of the 
final Follow -Up Visit .  Only  samples collected from subjects receiving OKZ will be 
analyzed for OKZ concentrations in plasma .  Data for these subjects will be included in 
future planned population PK modeling . 
4.5 Pharmacokinetic /Pharmacodynamic  Correlations 
The PK and immunogenicity of OKZ will be assessed by:  
• Characterizing the dose/exposure -response relationships related to efficacy endpoints 
(e.g., ACR20 response) and i dentifying potential factors that may impact the efficacy 
endpoints  
• Characterizing the dose/exposure -response relationships related to safety endpoints 
(e.g.,  lipi[INVESTIGATOR_386511]) and identifying potential factors that may impact the safety 
endpoints  
• Evaluating the impact of ADAs on subject safety, efficacy, and PK of OKZ  
4.6 Exploratory Endpoints  
• Exploratory pharmacogenetic (PG) assessments (in subjects who sign the separate PG 
informed consent form [ ICF] only) to examine whether individual genetic variation in 
genes relating to drug metabolism, RA, and the drug target pathway confers a differential 
response to OKZ.  
• Exploratory biomarker assessments aiming to identify potential markers that are associated with treatment response to OKZ, correlated with the s everity or progression of 
RA, or are cardiovascular (CV) surrogate biomarkers.  
4.7 Safety Endpoints  
The safety of OKZ will be assessed by:  
• The nature, incidence, severity, and outcome of AEs, including SAEs and adverse events of special interest (AESIs)  
• Proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities  
• Assessment of changes over time in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, and

350 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 2:2:1 ratio ( 140, 140, 
and 70 subjects per group, respectively) , as follows:  
1. OKZ 64 mg q4w:  SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q4w (alternating with SC injection of 
placebo OKZ q4w to maintain blinding) + MTX  
2. OKZ 64 mg q2w:  SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q2w + MTX  
3. Placebo:  SC injection of placebo q2w + MTX  
This is a double -blind study; as the placebo differs in  appearance from OKZ, study treatment 
will be prepared by  [CONTACT_386563]  (e.g., nurse) out of 
sight of the subject and any blinded study team members  and provided to blinded site staff in 
blinded syringes that are identical  in appearance.  T he SC injections of OKZ or  placebo will 
be administered every other week by [CONTACT_386564] .  In addition, the study site 
staff will be trained in methods that must be followed and documented to maintain the blind .  
Guidance o n specific blinding procedures will be provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
As noted above for treatment group No. 1, in order to maintain the blind, subjects 
randomized to receive OKZ q4w will receive placebo injections at the alternate q4w interval (e.g., Week  2, Week  6, etc) at prespecified visits as described in Table 1.  
Throughout the double -blind T reatment P eriod, all subjects will be required to remain on a 
stable dose of background MTX at 15 to 25 mg/week (or ≥ 10 mg/week if there is 
documented intoleranc e to higher doses) with a stable route of administration, and 
concomitant treatment with folic acid ≥[ADDRESS_484420] every other week for response and safety assessments as 
per Table 1.  Blood samples to assess OKZ concentrations in plasma will be collected 
periodically during the Treatment Period as per  Table 4.   
Subjects will be classified in terms of their response to study treatment at Week 14, with 
nonresponders  defined as subjects from any treatment group who do not improve by [CONTACT_97242] t 
20% in both SJC and TJC  (66-68 joint assessment ).  Starting a t or as close as possible to 
Week  14, nonresponders  in all groups will be administered sulfasalazine and/or 
hydroxychloroquine as rescue medication in addition to OKZ  (see Section  6.13.3).

Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study and evaluated using the CTCAE 
version 4.0. 
There will be ongoing monitoring of safety events, including laboratory findings, by 
R-Pharm and /or R-Pharm ’s designee.  In addition, safety will be assessed throughout the

predefined charter .  The charter will define the criteria, data, and source 
documentation required to adjudicate all MACE . 
2. Baseline CV risks including individual risk factors  (e.g., tobacco use, presence of 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lipid profile ) will be assessed . 
3. Known CV risk factors will be monitored and assessed to detect any trends over 
long-term exposure. 
Cardiovascular risk assessment data will be  provided to the CVAC for use in review and 
adjudication of MACE  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) .

Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  56 Confidential  5.2.2 Safety Follow -up Assessments  
Given the long half -life of OKZ (approximately 31 days), subjects will be followed  up for 
approximately 5 OKZ half -lives (i.e., 22 weeks) after the final dose of study treatment.  
For subjects remaining on randomized therapy until the last scheduled dose of study 
treatment  at Visit 14 (Week 22) and not entering the OLE study, a full safety assessment will 
be performed at the EoT Visit (Visit 15 [ Week 24 ]) and extended Safety Follow -Up 
procedures will be performed at visits scheduled + 4, +12, and + [ADDRESS_484425] dose 
of study treatment (i.e., Visits  SFU -1 [Week  26], SFU -2 [Week  30], and SFU -3 [(Week  44], 
respectively).  
Subjects who discontinue randomized study  treatment early  (i.e., prior to Week 24) will 
adhere to the established double -blind Treatment Per iod visit schedule outlined in Table 1, as 
if they were still receiving study treatment.  In addition, all subjects who discontinue study  
treatment early will have extended Safety Follow -Up assessments performed at the following 
time points : 
• Full safety assessment [ADDRESS_484426] dose of study  treatment  (EoT Visit) 
(see Section  5.4.2)  
• Safety Follow -Up Visit +[ADDRESS_484427] dose of study treatment  (Visit SFU -1)

(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS])  
• Safety Follow -Up Visit +[ADDRESS_484429] dose of study treatment (Visit SFU -3) 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
Depending on the timing  of study treatment discontinuation, it is possible that the 
double -blind Treatment Per iod visits (Visits 2 through 15) may occur at the same time as the 
Safety Follow -Up Visits.  In such cases, t he study site staff  should complete all study 
procedures required by [CONTACT_386566]; i f there are overlaps in the required laboratory tests,

[IP_ADDRESS] Screening (Visit 1 , Days  -28 to - 1) 
A separate ICF is completed for the main study and the PG study ( optional ).  W ritten 
informed consent must be obtained prior to the performance of any protocol -specific 
procedures at Screening .  The Investigator at each study  site will ensure that each subject has 
been provided with full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, 
and available details of possible risks an d benefits of the study.  
Subjects must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study treatment or 
the whole study at any time .  The Investigator will discuss with the subject  the importance of 
participation in the study despi[INVESTIGATOR_386514].  T he subject should 
be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed adequate time to consider the written 
information provided.  T he Investigator must retain the original, signed ICF for the study file .  
A copy of the signed ICF must be given to the subject .  Once informed consent has been 
obtained, the subject ’s eligibility to enter the study will be verified in accordance with the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (refer to Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2, respectively).  
Enrollment will occur using  an Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ) at Screening  upon 
ICF signature .  The IWRS will assign a unique subject number at Screening . 
Screening may be conducted up to 28 days  prior to  randomization. 
If the Investigator considers Screening  laboratory tests wi th exclusionary results to be due to 
laboratory error or a transient condition, these tests may be repeated once during the

[IP_ADDRESS] Randomization (Visit 2, Week 0)  
The results of all Screening  procedures must be available at or prior to the Baseline Visit 
(Visit 2) to determine eligibility for enrollment into the study .  The Investigator must 
evaluate the results of laboratory tests performed at Screening  to determine if any laboratory 
test results are outside the ranges specified in the eligibility criteria , and joint counts should 
be reconfirmed before randomization; no exceptions to these requirements will be allowed.  
If a subject meets all study eligibility criteria, the Investigator  will randomize the subject via 
the IWRS ; if not, the subject should be recorded a s a screen failure in the IWRS.

The HAQ- DI is a patient -reported questionnaire that provides an assessment of the impact of 
the disease and its treatment on physical function .  The HAQ- DI assesses the degree of 
difficulty experienced in 8 domains of daily living activities using 20  questions .  The 
domains are dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and 
common daily activities, and each domain (activity) consists of 2 or 3  items .  For each 
question, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 where 0  = without any difficulty, 
1 = with some difficulty, 2  = much difficulty, and 3 =  unable to do.  E ach category is given a 
score by [CONTACT_386594] (i.e., question in each categ ory with the 
highest score for that category).  
If the maximum score is 0  or 1, but a device related to that category is used, or help from 
another person is provided for the category, then the category score is increased to 2.  If the 
category score is alr eady a 2  (or above), the score in that category remains [ADDRESS_484491] responses, no disability score will be calculated.

5 dimensions (i.e., mobility, se lf-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression) .  The subject is asked to grade their own current level of function in each 
dimension into 1 of 5 degrees of disability ( extreme, severe, moderate, slight, or none) .  The 
combination of these with the conditions “death” and “unconscious” enables a description of 
3127 different health states .  Each health state can be ranked and transformed as a single 
score called the utility . 
The EQ -5D health states  may be converted into a single summary index by [CONTACT_2931] a

The WPS -RA measures the impact of RA and treatmen t on subject productivity within and 
outside the home during the previous month.  It contains 9  questions addressing employment 
status, productivity within and outside the home, and daily activities .  One item of the 
WPS- RA addresses current labor market p articipation .  This is a strong indicator of work 
ability because not working implies complete loss of paid productivity .  There are also 
normative and comparative data available on employment status .  Two items capture 
self-reported work absences due to a rthritis, and 2 items capture the same concept but applied 
to non- paid work.  T hese are separated into full and partial days (i.e.,  days of work missed 
and days with productivity reduced by [CONTACT_289428]) .  Additional items capture the 
respondent's estimat e of the extent to which arthritis has interfered with the subject ’s work

Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biological 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.  
This search for biomarkers of disease and drug response will involve an integrated molecular 
approach examining genetic and serum protein profiles.  These exploratory assessments aim 
to identify potential markers of response and/or loss of response, and to c haracterize 
molecular mechanisms of treatment with OKZ.  
Any biomarker samples may be stored for up to 20 years (depending on local regulations) to research scientific questions related to OKZ,  RA , and related diseases with a potential 
involvement of IL 6.  The material can be destroyed on subject’s request at any time.  Details on the collection, handling , and shipment of the samples to the central laboratory will be 
provided to Investigators in the Laboratory Manual. 
Any results from these exploratory biomarker assessments will be reported separately.  
Serum biomarkers related to systemic inflammation, bone and joint metabolism, and CV risk will be measured.  The final selection of analytes will be driven by [CONTACT_386600], new 
information from the pub lic domain, results obtained in other OKZ clinical studies, as well as 
by [CONTACT_386601].  In addition, selected

Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of OKZ in subjects with a histo ry of recurring infection or with underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes) that may 
predispose subjects to infections.  Study Treatment should not be administered to subjects 
with active  or clinically significant infection.  Vigilance for timely detection of  serious 
infection is recommended for subjects receiving biologic agents for treatment of RA, as signs 
and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase 
reaction.  Subjects must be instructed to contact [CONTACT_386603] n immediately when any

• Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and 
herbal/dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special 
diets.  
• Ruling out acute viral hepatitis (types A, B, C, D, and E), cytomegalovirus, Epstein- Barr 
virus, autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy, and biliary tract disease.  
• Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemic al agents.  
• Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct bilirubin, biliary tract ultrasonography/imaging results, liver biopsy).  
• Considering  gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
All additional investigations should be recor ded in the eCRF via the EDC system, and all

[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Site Reactions  
An injection site reaction is any untoward medical event occurring at the injection site during 
or after  study treatment administration that can be at least possibly attributed to the study 
treatment  (i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out) . 
An assessment of pain, redness, swelling, induration, hemorrhage, and itching at the injection site will be perfor med by a physician and recorded on the specific page of the eCRF.  At all 
specified visits (see Table 1), the assessment of injection site reactions will be made prior to any administration of study treatment.  All local reactions that are observed will be monitored until they resolve.

the DSMB and CVAC will only serve on their appointed committee . 
Further details (e.g., frequency of data reviews and study committee composition and 
membership) will be provided in the predefined DSMB Charter and a separate CVAC Chart er. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Data Safety Monitoring Board 
The independent DSMB members will perform ongoing safety surveillance and provide recommendations to R -Pharm regarding study conduct .  These recommendations will be 
based mainly on the review of data for AEs and laboratory  parameters.   In the event that the 
DSMB uncovers an issue  that needs to be addressed by [CONTACT_386605], only members of the DSMB are permitted to conduct additional analysis of the  
unblinded safety data.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee  
The CVAC will be responsible for evaluating MACE and will remain blinded to treatment 
assignment .  The importance of the CVAC is to ensure that all potential MACE  that have 
been reported are judged uniformly by a single group, using the same adjudication criteria . 
Data on the following fatal and nonfatal potential MACE ( as further defined in the CVAC 
Charter) will be collected and the events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_386606] (as well as assessed by [CONTACT_4318]) : 
• Cardiovascular death  
• Non-fatal myocardial infarction  
• Non-fatal stroke of all classifications

such events on the AEs eCRF page, it is important to convey the concept that the pre -existing 
condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g ., “mor e frequent headaches”) .  
All AEs related to protocol procedures must be reported to R -Pharm ’s designee . 
Investigators will seek information on AEs at each subject contact.  A ll AEs, whether 
reported by [CONTACT_386607] , will be reco rded in the subject ’s medical 
record and on the AEs eCRF page.  
All AEs that occur after the ICF is signed , regardless of severity, are to be recorded on the 
appropriate AE pages in the eCRF (either serious or nonserious) .  The Investigator should 
complete all the details requested including dates of onset, severity, action taken, outcome, 
and relationship to study treatment.  E ach event should be recorded separately.  
Investigators will be instructed to report to R -Pharm ’s designee their assessment of the 
potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, studied disease state, study treatment, and/or drug delivery system via eCRF.  
Study site staff will record any dosage of study treatment that exceeds the assigned dosage in 
the protocol via eCRF.  
Any clinically significant findings from laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, other procedures, etc should be reported to R -Pharm ’s designee  via eCRF, EDC, and/or designated 
data transmission methods .  Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts 
when recording AEs on the AEs eCRF page, avoiding colloquialisms and abbreviations .  
Only 1  AE term should be recorded in the event field on the AEs eCRF page .  For AEs other 
than injection -related reactions, a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the AEs eCRF 
page rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases) .  However, if a constellation of 
signs and/or sym ptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the AEs eCRF page .  If 
a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [ADDRESS_484514] also be recorded in the AE page of 
the eCRF.

Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data .  However, if any subject responses 
suggestive of a possible AE are identified during study site review of the PRO 
questionnaires, study site staff will alert the Investigator, who will determine if the criteria 
for an AE have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the subject's 
medical record per study site practice.  If the event meets the criteria for an AE, it will be 
reported on the AEs eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of S erious Adverse Events  
All SAEs  that occur after the subject has signed the ICF , regardless of the Investigator ’s 
assessment on causality , must be recorded on the relevant  pages of the eCRF  and reported to 
R-Pharm according to  protocol requirements.  
Investigators must report the SAE within [ADDRESS_484515] becoming aware of the event using the back- up paper SAE report form 
(instructions provided in the Investigator binders) .  Once the EDC system is operating 
normally again, Investigators must enter the SAE in the eCRF pages .  All SAEs should be 
followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event or  until the event is otherwise 
explained .  The timelines and procedure for follow -up reports are the same as those for the 
initial report.  R -Pharm’s designee  is responsible for managing the safety database.  
R-Pharm will be alerted of all SAEs occurring dur ing a subject ’s follow -up regardless of the 
Investigator ’s assessment of causality .  SAEs occurring after a subject has received the last 
dose of study treatment will be collected  and report ed to R -Pharm ’s designee through the end 
of the Safety Follow -Up P eriod (i.e., for a period of [ADDRESS_484516] dose of study 
treatment ), regardless of the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_17963].  The Investigator must  also 
inform participating subjects of the need to inform the Investigator of any SAE that occurs within this period.  Any SAE with a start date after the Follow -Up Period is not required to 
be reported unless the Investigator thinks that an event may be related to either the study treatment , study treatment administration, or a protocol procedure.

R-Pharm ’s designee will also prepare an expedited report for other safety issues where these 
might materially alter the current benefit- risk assessment of OKZ or that would be sufficient 
to consider changes in the study treatment administration or in the overall conduct of the 
study .  The study  site will also forward a copy of all expedited reports to the relevant  
Independent Ethics Commit tee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with 
national regulations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow -up of A dverse Events  
Any AEs that occur after the subject has signed the ICF  until the end of the Safety 
Follow -Up Period (i.e., [ADDRESS_484517] dose of s tudy treatment ) will be followed up 
to resolution.  R esolution means that the subject has returned to a baseline state of health , the 
Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE , or the subject 
is lost to follow -up.  For AEs  with a causal relationship to the study treatment , R-Pharm or its 
designee must concur with the Investigator’s assessment. 
For SAEs, nonserious AESIs , and pregnancies, R -Pharm ’s designee  may follow -up by 
[CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and 
outcome information (e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], consultant reports, or autopsy

SAE until the event has resolved to the baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as 
stable by [CONTACT_737], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the subject withdraws consent .  
If the subject is lo st to follow -up, the SAE will be categorized based on the Investigator ’s last 
assessment .  Every effort should be made to follow all SAEs considered to be related to OKZ 
or study -related procedures until an outcome can be reported.  
During the study, resolution of SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the SAE page of 
the eCRF and in the subject ’s medical record to facilitate source data verification .  If, after 
follow -up, return to the baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an expl anation 
should be recorded on the SAE page of the eCRF.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.

Clinical laboratory tests will be reviewed for results of potential clinical significance at all 
time points throughout the study .  The Investigator will evaluate any change in laboratory 
values .  If the Investigator determines a laboratory abnormality to be clinically significant, it 
is considered a laboratory AE; however, if the abnormal laboratory value is consistent with a current diagnosis  (or signs or symptoms if a diagnosis is not possible)  and is not a clinically 
significant worsening from the baseline laboratory parameter , it should be documented 
accordingly without being r eported as a separate laboratory  AE.  The central laboratory will 
analyze the samples .  Further details of the procedures to be followed for sample collection, 
storage, and shipment will be documented in a Laboratory M anual .  Additional and repeat 
laborato ry testing not specified in Table 1 may be performed at the discretion of the 
Investigator either at the local lab oratory  or at the central lab oratory  to ensure that the safety 
of subjects is protected.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Parameters

[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital signs ( temperature, h eart rate, BP , and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ) will be measured as indicated in 
Table 1, and when clinically indicated .  Whenever possible, vital sign assessments should be 
performed by [CONTACT_386613](s) 
throughout the study .  Blood pressure and heart rate should be measured after the subject 
rests 5  minutes in a sitting position . 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE .  A vital sign result should be reported as 
an AE if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in a change in RA treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or 
treatment discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention or  a change in concomitant therapy  
• Clinically significant in the Investigator ’s judgment  
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings .  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sig n abnormality should 
be classified as an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Body Weight  and Heigh t 
Body weight ( to the nearest 0.1  kilogram  [kg]) and h eight ( in cm) will be recorded at the time

for Screening Visit” is answered  “Yes” the subject  is not allowed to enter the study (see 
exclusion  criterion No. 19, Section 5.3.2) .  A “Yes” response to any of the other questions 
within the questionnaire at Screening should trigger further careful assessment to determine 
the subject’s risk of TB disease.  
At all post -Screening visits , a “Yes” response on the “Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire for 
Post-Screening Visits” should be treated as follows:  
• Question 1:  If a subject answers “Yes” study treatment should be discontinued if active 
TB is confirmed (see Section  6.11).  
• Questions 2 through 6:  If a subject answers “Yes” to any question, they should be 
assessed (TB risk questionnaire and physical examination) [ADDRESS_484521], if needed.  
• Questions 7 through 12:  If a subject answers “Yes” to any question, this should trigger a 
careful assessment to determine if the subject developed TB (see Section  7.6.10).  
This risk questionnaire s are not to be used to exclude TB disease or confirm diagnosi s. 
7.6.10 Management of T uberculosis  
Subjects who  develop evidence of latent or active TB once enrolled in the study (and 
receiving study treatment) must immediately discontinue further administration of study treatment , and the subject  should be examined by a certified TB specialist or pulmonologist 
who is familiar with diagnosing and treating TB (as acceptable per local practice) . 
If active TB is confirmed, the subject must permanently discontinue study treatment (see Section  6.11) .  Confirmed active TB is an SAE that  must be recorded on the relevant pages

Data Management/Coding  
Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the relevant SOPs of the Data Management and Biostatistics departments of R -Pharm ’s designee . 
An EDC system will be used for this study, meaning that all eCRF data will be entered in electronic forms at the study site .  Data collection will be completed by [CONTACT_386615] .  Appropriate training and security measures will be 
completed with the Investigator and all authorized study site staff prio r to the study being 
initiated and any data being entered into the system for any study subjects.  
All data must be entered in English .  The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations 
on the subjects participating in the study .  Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon 
as possible during or after the subject ’s visit .  To avoid interobserver variability, every effort 
should be made to ensure that the same individual who made the initial baseline 
determinations completes all efficacy and s afety evaluations .  The Investigator must verify 
that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct .  If some assessments are not done, 
or if certain information is not available or not applicable or unknown, the Investigator should indicate this in the eCRF .  The Investigator will be required to electronically sign off

Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : [ADDRESS_484525] 1  of the 2 OKZ dose regimens  
is shown to be efficacious and that a priori both OKZ dose regimens are assumed to be 
efficacious, disjunctive power (i.e., a probability of detecting a significant treatment effect 
for at least 1  OKZ treatment regimen) will be used as a criterion for the estimation of the 
sample size . 
Sample size requirements are calculated to provide sufficient disjunctive power to evaluate 
the primary endpoint ( superiority of OKZ relative to placebo with respect to 
ACR20  response rate at Week 12 ) and the first secondary endpoint ( superiority of OKZ 
relative to placebo with respect to the proportion of subjects with DAS28  [CRP] <3.2 at 
Week 12 ). 
Sample size was es timated taking into account a multiplicity control procedure and the 
resulting α  adjustment to control an overall Type  I error rate in the strong sense at a 1- sided  
α = 0.025 across the primary and secondary endpoints .  More specifically, the α -control 
strategy will be based on using the Bonferroni adjustment for the tests related to each of the 
2 OKZ dose  regimen s versus placebo (i.e., using the 1- sided  α = 0.0125 for each dose) .  A

Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  137 Confidential  The ACR20 response rate at Week 12  for the placebo group is estimated to be 2 0% in this 
study population ( Emery et al, 2008; Burmester et al, 2013; Genovese et al, 2014) .  The OKZ 
ACR20  response rates  for [ADDRESS_484528] 45%  and 50% , respectively , resulting in an expected difference in 
ACR20  response rates of 25  and 30 percentage points between the respective OKZ treatment 
groups  and placebo.  
The DAS28  low disease activity (based on DAS28  [CRP] <3.2) response rate at Week 12  is 
estimated to be 5% in the placebo group (Emery et al, 2008; Cohen et  al, 2006) and 18% and 
21% in [ADDRESS_484529] 
approximately 10% of subjects discontinuing randomized treatment prior to Week 12 .  In this 
study, subjects who discontinue prior to Week 12  will be classified as nonresponders  for the 
primary endpoint of  the ACR20  response rate at Week 12  and for the secondary endpoint of 
DAS28  (CRP ) <3.2 at Week 12 .  Details regarding subjects who discontinue treatment and/or 
study participation prematurely can be found in Section 9.4.9. 
The primary endpoint as well as the secondary endpoints that are binary in nature will be 
analyzed using a 2 ×[ADDRESS_484530] for equality of proportions for each OKZ treatment 
group compared with placebo.  A continuity correction may be used if the expected cell 
counts are <5.  
Based on the treatment effect assumptions and the methodology for estimating sample size 
via simulation to ensure sufficien t disjunctive power as described above, a sample size of 
350 subjects randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio (140, 140, and 70 subjects per group, respectively) 
will yield 99% disjunctive power for testing the primary hypothesis (ACR20 at Week 12 ) and 
82% disjunctive power for the evaluation of the secondary endpoint of DAS28 (CRP) 
<3.2 rate at Week 12 .

Anato mic Therapeutic Class (ATC) level 2, and preferred drug name.  
Prior medications will be distinguished from concomitant medications by a stop date before the first dose of the study treatment.  M edications that stopped on the same date as the first 
dose of the study treatment will be considered a prior medication .  Any medication that a 
subject started before the first dose of double -blind study treatment and continued to take

Each of the OKZ treatment groups  (64 mg q2w and 64 mg q4w) will be compared with 
placebo for each of the primary, secondary, and other endpoints . 
The overall Type I error rate will be controlled for testing hypotheses of the primary and 
secondary endpoints at the overall 1- sided  α = 0.025. 
The α-control strategy will be based on using the Bonferroni adjustment for the tests related

each dose) .  A gate-keepi[INVESTIGATOR_386523] .  In other words, each OKZ dose regimen 
will be tested at 1- sided  α = 0.0125 for a given endpoint if null hypotheses are rejected at 
1-sided  α = 0.0125 for this dosing regimen for all previous endpoints based on the 
established order .  Conversely, the testing will stop for a given OKZ dose regimen at the 
endpoint for which the null hypothesis is accepted at 1- sided  α = 0.0125.  
The above multiplicity control procedure will be applied to the primary analysis of the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints  based on the ITT population, and will not be 
applied to the sensitivity analyses of these endpoints. 
9.4.7 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR20 response 
and remaining on randomized treatment and in the study at Week 12 , analyzed using the 
ITT population as the primary efficacy analysis .  Supportive analyses of the primary endpoint 
will also be done using the mITT, if sufficiently different from the ITT pop ulation, and 
PP populations.  
The ACR20 response at Week 12  for each of the OKZ 64 mg treatment groups  (q2w and 
q4w) will be compared with placebo using a 2× [ADDRESS_484535] for equality of proportions . 
The overall Type I error rate will be controlled using a procedure in the strong sense at a 1-sided  α = 0.025 for testing multiple hypotheses for the 2 OKZ treatment groups versus 
placebo across the primary and secondary endpoints as described in Section 9.4.6. 
As a supportive analysis, the difference between proportions of responders in each of the 
OKZ treatment groups and placebo (relative risk) wil l be estimated together with the 
corresponding 97.5% 2 -sided confidence interval for difference of proportions using the 
Newcombe hybrid score method .

In this study, subjects who discontinue randomized treatment prematurely will be required  to 
remain on study and be evaluated as per the planned S chedule of Events .  For the main 
analysis of all binary endpoints, inability to remain on randomized treatment through the time 
point of interest is defined as treatment failure (nonresponse) .  For the main analysis of 
continuous endpoints, subjects who discontinue randomized treatment prematurely but remain on study thro ugh the time point of interest will be included using all collected 
measurements , including those from  assessments after treatment discontinuation .

Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : [ADDRESS_484538] to the definition of the 
corresponding endpoint . 
Similarly, for all endpoints that are continuous in nature, a return to baseline values will be assumed and will be implemented using a multiple imputation  (MI)  methodology  allowing to 
account for the uncertainly of missing data according to the methodolog y of Rubin 
(Rubin, 1987) .  Imputed values will be sampled from a posterior Bayesian distribution of the 
baseline values of each continuous parameter (for all treatment groups combined) using a 
regression imputation model with age, sex, time from RA diagnosis to first study dose, and 
duration of prior MTX t reatment as predictor variables .  Multiply imputed data will be 
analyzed with an ANCOVA model  and the results will be combined using the Rubin’ s rule 
(Rubin, 1987) .  Additional details will be provided in the SAP.  
Intermediate Missing Data  
Missing data may also result from missed intermediate visits for subjects who completed the 
study .  For all binary endpoints, missing intermediate responder status will be imputed from 
the surrounding visits .  If the status at visits both before and after the missed visit is classified 
as responder, the subject will be considered a responder at the missed visit .  Otherwise, the 
subject will be considered a nonresponder .  If an assessment for a given binary endpoint at 
the last visit is missing for a completing subject, data from the 2  previous visits will be used 
with the same logic for determining the response status .  For the ACR20/50/[ADDRESS_484539] as a responder, the responder category will be used.  O therwise, 
the method based on surrounding visits as described above will be applied.   Similarly, for all 
continuous endpoints, an average of values from the surrounding visits will be imputed for the missing visit.   For placebo subjects completing treatment through Week 16, if the 
assessment at Week 16 is missing, the 2  previous visits will be u sed as surrounding visits.

based on the criteria of achieving the corresponding clinical response (e.g., ACR20) using all 
data collected at the time point of interest, i.e., including data collected after premature 
discontinuation of randomized treatment .  Subjects who discontinue from the study overall, 
will be considered nonresponders  at time points after study discontinuation.  
For the supportive analysis of continuous endpoints, data collected after premature 
discontinuation of randomized treatment will be excluded and replaced with values imputed based on the return to baseline approach implemented with MI as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
These supportive analyses will be performed for all efficacy  endpoints . 
Sensitivity to Missing Data Assumptions   
The method of handling missing data that considers discontinued subjects as nonresponders  
or imputes continuous data with baseline values may be regarded as not conservative if the proportion of subjects droppi[INVESTIGATOR_386524] .  
To address the possibility of this scenario, an alter native strategy will be used to stress -test 
the analysis  of the efficacy endpoints . 
Analysis of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be repeated using all collected 
data (including data after premature study treatment discontinuation) but with missing data 
after study withdrawal  (for subjects withdrawing prior to Week 12 ) imputed under the 
following assumptions .  Missing post study withdrawal data for subjects discontinuing from 
the placebo group will be imputed under the assumption of the missing -at-random ( MAR ) 
mechanism, where these discontinued subjects are assumed to have postwithdrawal values in 
line with similar placebo subjects who remained in the study, taking into account their values observed prior to discontinuation.  F or subjects discontinuing from the OKZ treatment 
groups , missing postwithdrawal data will be imputed from the same MAR -based imputation 
model estimated from the placebo subjects, assuming that after discontinuation, the OKZ subjects will drift towards the mean response of the placebo group.  T his approach is likely to

nonresponder/return to baseline assumption, while for the OKZ treatment groups , it will not 
assume a treatment effect beyond the study effect and the effect of the background MTX 
therapy .  This approach will be more conservative compared with  the primary analysis if the 
proportion of subjects discontinuing from the study  is greater in the placebo group than in the 
OKZ treatment groups .

be multiply imputed under the MAR assumption within each treatment group using a multivariate normal imputation model and the Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) metho d.  
Second, intermediate missing d ata imputed in this way will then be used together with 
observed data for the estimation of the MAR -based model from the placebo grou p, which 
will be done using sequential regression imputation models applied to each continuous 
parameter  (Ratitch  et al, 2013) .  The MAR -based placebo imputation model for each 
parameter will be estimated based on data from placebo subjects and will include baseline 
value of the corresponding parameter and all postbaseline values prior to study 
discontinuation as explanatory variables .  Poststudy discontinuation missing values up to

achieving the corresponding clinical response .  Multiply imputed datasets will be analyzed 
using the same methods as in the primary analysis, followed by [CONTACT_386627]’ s rule (Rubin, 1987).  
Additionally, for the primary and secondary endpoints that are binary in nature, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_386525].  F irst, binary response status at the time point of interest 
will be computed using  all collected data regardless of adherence to randomized treatment 
through the time point of interest based on the criteria of achieving the corresponding clinical response .  For subjects who withdraw from the study overall , all possible combinations of t he 
number of responders and nonresponders  in each treatment group will be considered.  T he 
results of analysis for all possible combinations will be summarized graphically , depi[INVESTIGATOR_155772] a

Amendment 1 .1 ([LOCATION_002]) : 28 May 2018  147 Confidential  For the secondary endpoint that measures physical ability based on the HAQ -DI 
improvement at Week 12 , a continuous responder analysis will also be performed.  S ubjects 
will be considered responders at a specified improvement threshold if they experience 
percent age improvement in the HAQ -DI score from baseline to Week 12  that is greater or 
equal to the specified threshold and if they remain on the randomized treatment and in the study through Week 12 .  This analysis will be performed for a range of improvement 
thresholds from 0%  to 100% in 5% increments .  The results will summarized using a graph 
of proportion of responders in each treatment group versus improvement thresholds. 
Sensitivity to Data Following Initiation of Rescue Medication  
Sensitivity analyses classifying subjects who receive any rescue medication  as nonresponders 
will be performed for binary efficacy endpoints defined at time points from Week 16 to Week  24. 
9.4.10 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic concentrations for OKZ in plasma will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_386534].  Time to steady  state will be graphically 
evaluated for the OKZ trough data collected over the study period.  Olokizumab 
concentrations from placebo subjects who are ran domized to receive OKZ starting at 
Week  16 will be summarized separately and will not be part of the time to steady state 
evaluation.  Pharmacokinetic relationships will be explored graphically and with linear or nonlinear modeling approaches, as appropria te.  Data collected in this study may be 
combined with data from other OKZ studies in support of population PK analyses.  
The related endpoints are described in in Section 4.4.  Further details for the PK analysis will be provided in the SAP . 
9.4.11 PK/PD Correlations  
The PK/PD relationship and immunogenicity of OKZ will be determined as described in the endpoints by [CONTACT_8985] 4.5.  Analyses may include statistical comparisons and/or population PK/PD analyses.  Further details for evaluation of PK/PD and PK/safety correlations will be

may be summarized by [CONTACT_386629].  
9.4.13 Pharmacogenetics  
The exploratory PG studies are designed to investigate the association between genetic 
factors (genotypes) and clinical assessments (phenotypes) which are collected during the 
clinical trial.  Without prior evidence of a strong association, a number of possible 
associations are evaluated with exploratory analyses.  A range of statistical tests (chi -square 
tests, ANCOVAs, li near and logistic regression) are used for the an alyses.  Additional data  
from subsequent clinical trials are often needed to confirm associations.  Alternatively, if the number of subjects enrolled in the study is  too small to complete proper statistical analyses, 
these data may be combined, as appropriate, with those from other studies to enlarge the data 
set for analysis.  
9.4.14 Biomarkers  
Soluble marker panel studies investigate differences in the level of expression of proteins or 
peptides between individuals  in a given biofluid.  The goal of such studies is to allow the 
identification of potential protein or peptide biomarkers of drug action or disease, and to better understand the associated underlying molecular mechanisms.  By [CONTACT_386630] (e.g., principal component analysis) between subject groups, distinct study 
time points, or between study groups from other clinical trials, it may be possible to identify 
patterns which are associated with disease state or response to drug treatme nt.  However, the 
exact type of data analysis method will depend on the type of data obtained in the study and 
thus the analysis of this data will be data driven.  
9.4.15 Safety Analyses  
Analysis of safety endpoints (see Section 4.6) will be done based on the S afety population.  
Subjects in the S afety population will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually 
received , using the treatment sequence g roups described in Section 9.4.  A dditionally to the 
primary safety analysis , the incidence of AEs  will be analyzed separately for subjects 
administered additional DMARD s as rescue medication during the Treatment Period  and for 
subjects not receiving additional DMARDs as rescue medication.  
Additional summaries will be provided for changes from the last  value prior to Week 16 
dosing to time points after Week 16 dosing for subjects switching from placebo to OKZ at Week 16.

1.0 Study Summary  
 
Title: Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal  Events Trial (S MART) 
 
Study Aims:  
 Primary: To compare  the effect of 0.9% saline versus physiologically -balanced 
isoto nic fluids on the development  of major adverse kidney  events by 30 days  
(MAKE 30) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit  
 Secondary: To evaluate the effect of th e same intervention in the same 
population on laboratory outcomes of change in creatinin e and  incidence of 
metabolic  acidosis and alkalosis;  urinary and serum markers of acute kidney 
injury; and clinical outcomes of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], ICU -free days, and receipt  
of renal replacement therapy  
 
Study Hypotheses:  
 Primary: Use of physiologicall y-bala nced isotonic fluids in ICU patients will 
decrease the development  of MAKE 30 
 Secondary: Use of physiologically -balanced isotonic fluids in ICU patients will 
decrease creatinine  rise and metabolic acidosis, decrease receipt  of renal 
replacement therap y, increase ICU -free days , and decrease mortality  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Admitted to an adult intensive care unit (ICU)  at Vanderbilt University Medical 
Center  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Age < 18 years  
 
Study Population:   All adult patients admitted to an adult ICU at VUMC  
 
Consent:  Given the current use of all isotonic solutions studied in routine clinical 
practice, the lack of established risk or benefit with any solution, the impracticability of 
obtaining informed consent prior to recei pt of intravenous fluid in  every critically ill 
patient admitted to VUMC , and randomization at the level of the intensive care unit  and 
not by [CONTACT_763213] , a waiver of informed consent will be requested.  
 
Randomization:   Each ICU  will be  initially  randomized to a fluid group (0.9% Saline 
versus  physiologically -balanced isotonic fluid)  and will then crossover between fluid 
groups every month during the  one year  study period.

Study Interventions : 
 0.9% Saline Arm:  Patients in an ICU randomized to 0.9% Saline on whom a 
provider  orders isotonic fluid will receive the ordered volume of 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride . 
 
 Physiologically -Balanced Isotonic Fluid Arm : Patients in an ICU randomized to 
physiologically -balanced isotonic fluid on whom a provider orders isotonic fluid 
will rece ive the ordered volume of Plasma -Lyte © A or Lactated Ringer’s  unless a 
pre-specified contraindication is present  (see below) . 
 
Primary Endpoint:    
 Develop ment of major adverse kidney event by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_191606] 30  
(MAKE 30).  A major adverse kidney  event is defined as at least one of the 
following: mortality, need for new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal 
dysfunction at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (defined as ≥ 200% of creatinine 
from baseline).  
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
1. In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102517]  
2. [ADDRESS_1045733] 28 days  
10. Incidence of metabolic acidosis and alkalosis  
11. Urinary biomarkers of pre -renal and intra -renal acute renal failure

 hypothesized to be explained by [CONTACT_763214]15 in which the 
hydrogen ion con centration in the plasma is  determined by [CONTACT_763215], weak acids (pri marily protein), and the balance of 
sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, and lactate ions known as the strong 
ion difference.  In this understanding, increasing concentrations of chloride relative to 
sodium decrease the strong ion difference an d increase the hydrogen ion concentration 
contributing to metabolic acidosis.

  Recently, a prospective, open -label, before -after study of over 1400 patients in a 
single intensive care unit transitioning from use of higher to lower chloride solutions 
demonstrated an association between higher chloride fluid  and the development of 
acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy7.  Observational studies are 
examining the relationship between chloride content and mortality in ICU patients 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) and randomized trials are comparing the incidence of acute kidney 
injury with chloride -rich ver sus chloride -poor fluids during cardiac surgery 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) but to date no randomized study examining the impact of chloride 
content on renal outcomes  or mortality  in critically ill patients has been conducted.   
 
3.[ADDRESS_1045738]  of physiologically -balanced isotonic fluid versus 0.9% 
saline on clinical outcomes of critically ill patients, a randomized controlled trial is 
needed.  
 
 Primary Aim: To compare the effect of 0.9% saline versus physiologically -
balanced isotonic fluids on the development of major adverse kidney events by 
30 days (MAKE 30) in intensive care unit patients  
 
 Secondary Aim: To evaluate the effect of the same intervention in the same 
population on laboratory outcomes of change in creatinine and incidence of 
metabolic acidosis and alkalosis; and clinical outcomes including  in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77087], ICU -free days, and receipt of renal replacement therapy  
 
To complete these aims, we will enroll  patients from participating  ICUs at Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center for the study period of one year  in a cluster -randomized 
controlled trial of  0.9% saline versus physiologically -balanced isotonic fluid ( Lactated 
Ringer’s or Plasma -Lyte ©). 
 
4.0 Previous Human Studies  
 Increasing recognition of the potential  differences in “isotonic” intravenous 
fluids has led to several prior studies examining chloride concentration in IV fluid in 
humans.  As detailed above, prior studies have examined the role of fluid chloride 
content in healthy human volunteers, patients unde rgoing surgery, patients with septic 
shock, and critically ill patients generally.  There are ongoing observational studies in ICU 
patients and a randomized controlled trial in cardiac surgery of higher versus lower 
chloride fluid.  The above studies provi de the rationale for a large, prospective 
randomized controlled trial of fluids with higher versus lower chloride content in the 
critically ill.

  [ADDRESS_1045739] of physiologically -balanced isotonic fluids versus 
0.9% saline  on the development of acute kidney injury.  The participating ICUs will be 
randomized to utilization of 0.9% sodium chloride or physiologically -balance isotonic 
fluid (Lactated Ringers or Plasma -Lyte © A).  Every patient admitted to an ICU at 
Vanderbilt Medical Center during the study period who meets no exclusion criteria will 
be enrolled and will receive the assigned study fluid if isotonic fluid is ordered by [CONTACT_763216].  All other  
decision s regarding fluid administration including indication, timing, rate, volume, and 
endpoint will remain at the discretion of the treati ng provider .  The study wi ll not 
impact the use of oral fluids or non -isotonic IV fluids.  Every month each ICU will 
undergo a cross -over in assigned fluid group such that each ICU will experience each 
fluid group assignment for equal time periods during the  study . 
 For logistical purposes, the study will be conducted as two, independent, 
parallel , randomized, multiple -crossover trials – one for patients enrolled from the 
medical ICU ( SMART -MED ) and one for patients enrolled from the other ICUs ( SMART -
SURG ).  Success of the ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (SALT) in the MICU of establishing the 
infrastructure needed to deliver the study intervention will allow enrollment  in SMART -
MED  to begin immediately in the MICU and run continuously for a one-year  study 
duration.  The initiation of enrollment  in the other ICUs ( SMART -SURG ) will be 
dependent on successfully transferring the infrastructure for delivery of the assigned 
intervention to these ICUs and is anticipated to be delayed 6 months from the start of 
the SMART -MED  trial.  The two, parallel tr ials ( SMART -MED  and SMART -SURG ) will be 
‘harmonized’ with identical design, intervention, and data collection to allow for analysis 
of all patients concurrently  in accordance with a pre -specified data -analysis plan .  In the 
event that  logistical difficulti es prevent the safe and effective conduct of the study in 
the ICUs in which it has not yet been pi[INVESTIGATOR_169354] ( SMART -SURG ), the patients enrolled 
in SMART -MED  will be analyzed independently,  adhering to a pre -specified data analysis 
plan.

 7.1 Study Sites:   Patients for this st udy will be enroll ed upon admission to the 
participating  intensive care unit (ICU) or adjacent ICU -“step down” units at Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center .  Participating ICUs within Vanderbilt University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763138]:  
 
SMART -MED : Medical ICU  (8T3)  
SMART -SURG : Surgical ICU  (9T3) , Cardiovascular ICU  (5N) , Trauma ICU  (10N) , 
Neurological and Neurosurgical ICU  (6T3) .  
 
7.2  Study Population:   All patients admitted to an ICU at Vanderbilt Medical Center 
during the study  period will be enrolled unless meeting exclusion  criteria.  Patients will 
be enrolled prior to receiving their first administration of isotonic IV fluid  in the ICU .  
Based on the admission rates to the participating ICUs in recent years, at least 3,000 
patients will be admitted to the MICU ( SMART -MED ) and 5,000  patients to the surgical 
ICUs ( SMART -SURG ) for a total of at least 8,000  patients admitted to all study ICUs 
(SMART)  during the one year  study period.  
 
7.3  Enrollment:  All patients will be enrolled in thi s cluster -randomized controlled, 
multiple crossover trial at the time of admission to the participating  ICU prior to the 
administration of any isotonic IV fluid  in the ICU . 
 
7.4  Consent:   
 
 “Normal Saline”  (0.9% sodium chloride ), Lactated Ringer’s, and Plasma -Lyte © 
are all non -prescription isoto nic intravenous fluids currently used in the routine care  of 
patients  admitted to the ICUs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center .  Currently, choice 
of isotonic fluid is based on provider  preference  as there are no  large randomized trials,  
evidence -based guidelines , or expert  recommendations to support the choice of one 
isotonic crystalloid over another.   In current practice, isotonic fluids are frequently used 
as carrier s for medications mixed by [CONTACT_763217] e choice of isotonic fluid being administered .  Additionally, recent national 
shortages of 0.9% saline and lactated ringers have dictated which  isotoni c fluids are 
administered to  critically ill patients at Vanderbilt.  Furthermore, we have discussed this 
randomization with the ICU directors of the participating ICUs who agree that equipoise 
exists on choice of isotonic intravenous fluid for their specific ICU patients and have 
agreed to allow their ICUs to be randomized and participate in the study.  
 Becau se all of the isotonic fluids examined in this study are currently in routine 
use in the study ICUs and there is no known difference in risk or benefit among them, a 
waiver of informed consent will be requested.  
 In addition to the minimal risk posed by t he study, obtaining informed consent 
prior to part icipation would not be feasible  or practicable .  Patients frequently receive

 fluid immediately after ICU admission and time delays in obtaining informed consent 
from the patient or surrogate prior to fluid administration might compromise  patient 
safety.  In addition, trying to consent every critical care admission at the time of their 
admission is not practicable.  Furthermore, the randomization is at the level of the ICU, 
meaning the “default” isotonic flui d for that ICU would be whatever they are 
randomized to, so obtaining a different isotonic iv fluid at a patient specific level would 
require considerable work on the clinical team.  The focus of the study on the choice of 
isotonic fluid by [CONTACT_763218] a hospit al-wide basis also precludes individual patient consent.  
With all ICUs at Vanderbilt randomized to a treatment arm, a patient who refused 
participation would have to be moved to an ICU at another institution, which might 
compromise patient safety.  
 
7.5  Randomization:    
 
 Participating ICUs will be randomized to an initial fluid group  (0.9% Saline or 
physiologically -balanced isotonic fluid)  using an a priori determined randomization 
scheme derived from a software program.  Following the  initial assignment , each ICU 
will crossover between fluid groups  every month  during the study period.  Individual 
patients will not be randomized for the purposes of this study.  Patients that are 
transferred between two participating ICUs will be treated according to the a ssignment 
for the unit in which they currently are cared for but will be analyzed by [CONTACT_763219] . 
 The effect of differing sodium, chloride, and potassium contents of Plasma -
Lyte ©, Lactated Ringer’s, and 0.9% So dium Chloride on patients ’ metabolic laboratory 
studies over the course of the ICU stay would make blinding of the treating provider s 
and nursing staff impossible.  Therefore, clinical personnel will not be blinded to the 
study intervention.  However, all on-study and outcome data will be collected by [CONTACT_763220].  
 
8.0 Study Procedures  
 
8.1  Treatment Arms  
 
Patients in an ICU randomized to 0.9% Saline will receive 0.9% sodium chloride 
whenever isotonic intravenous fluid adminis tration is ordered by [CONTACT_763221] .  
Patients in an ICU randomized to physiologically -balanced isotonic fluid will receive 
Plasma -Lyte © A or Lactated Ringer’s whenever isotonic intravenous fluid administration 
is ordered by [CONTACT_19203] .  The total volume, rate, initiation, cessation, and 
addition of electrolytes and glucose to the isotonic fluid assigned will be at the 
discretion of the ordering provider .  Adherence with the administration of assigned fluid

 in the study ICUs will be ensur ed by [CONTACT_763222].  
 
Pharmacy Supply:  
 For the duration of the study, each study ICU will be routinely stocked only with 
the isotonic fluid assigned for that block.  Upon request, the  alternative isotonic fluid 
will be available from the inpatient pharmacy.  
 
Order Entry:  
 For the duration of the study, when a provider begins an order for the 
administration of any isotonic fluid in the electronic order entry system an “Isotonic 
Fluid Wizard ” (Figure 8A) will: 1) Inform the provider of the stu dy, 2)  Solicit the presence 
of contraindications  to the assigned study fluid, and 3)  If contraindications are not 
present, guide the provider to order the assigned study fluid.  The manner in which fluid 
orders can be customized with regard to total volume, rate, electrolyte and dextrose 
content will not be affected by [CONTACT_729445].  
 There are no established contraindications to the choice of 0.9% saline once the 
decision has been made to administer i sotonic fluid.  Because of the marginally higher 
potassium content of Plasma -Lyte © and Lactated Ringer’s, patients being treated for 
hyperkalemia will be allowed to receive 0.9% saline regardless of study group .  
Because of the concern for the use of relat ively hypotonic solutions in patients with 
elevated intracranial pressure, these patients will also be allowed to receive 0.9% 
saline regardless of study group .  While there may be patients in whom treating 
provider s prefer no t to administer Ca2+ or lactat e (as in Lactated Ringer’s) or 
magnesium (as in Plasma -Lyte ©), because an alternative physiologically -balanced 
solution would be available without these electrolytes, 0.9% saline would not be 
allowed for these indications in those assigned to the physiolog ically -balanced isotonic 
fluid group.   Instead, the provider would have the option of choosing the other 
physiologically balanced solution (i.e. choose Plasma -Lyte© if worried about 
administering Ca2+ or lactate and choose Lactated Ringer’s if worried abou t 
administering magnesium or acetate).   Exception would be made only for the specific 
request of an identified attending provider.

Biomarkers/Specimens:  
 
In order to try to elucidate a potential mechanism of how 0.9% NaCl may cause renal 
failure and/or worse outcomes, biomarker analysis of biospecimens will be u ndertaken.  
From a select group of up to 1000 patients, urine and blood/plasma that is leftover and 
to be discarded from the laboratory after all ordered labs are performed will be 
collected.  Leftover specimens from the laboratory will be used to prevent direct 
interaction between any patients and the study team.  Specifically, urine will be 
collected from  up to 750 (375 in each group)  patients who develop acute renal failure 
while in the ICU.  In addition, a random sampling of leftover urine specimens fro m up to 
250 ICU patients will also be stored to ensure specimens are available from patients 
without kidney injury also.  Similarly, a random sampling of leftover plasma from up to

 500 patients will also be retrieved from the clinical laboratory prior to t hem discarding 
the specimens.  This leftover plasma will also be stored.  All specimens will be stored 
frozen at -800C in a locked freezer owned by [CONTACT_39548][INVESTIGATOR_2993]cipal [INVESTIGATOR_2993]vestigator [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a locked 
freezer room until analysis.   Collection and analysis of biospecimens  will be dependent 
on receipt of funding.   
 
9.0 Risks  and Benefits:  
 
 For patients in whom the treating provider  has ordered the administration of 
isotonic intravenous fluid, there are currently no established risks or benefits to the 
selection of 0.9% saline versus physiologically -balanced isotonic fluids .  Whether the 
differences in content of chloride, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and bases have 
clinical implications is unknown.  At this time there is no reason to believe that 
participation in this study w ould expose patient s to greater medical risks  or benefits  
than those experienced by [CONTACT_763224].  All of the isotonic 
intravenous fluids are used in routine care in all the Vanderbilt adult ICUs.  The greater 
benefit of t he study would be to society in the form of improved understanding of the 
relatively effects of these commonly used fluid solutions.    
 A potential risk to patients participating in this study involves the collection of 
personal health information.  In ord er to limit the associated risks, the minimum 
amount of health information necessary for study conduct will be collected.  After 
collection, the data will be stored in a secure online database (REDcap) and will be de -
identified to protect participant priva cy.  In addition, any biospecimens collected will be 
stored in a secure, locked freezer in a locked room of specimen freezers.  
 
 
 
10.0 Adverse Events : 
 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investiga tion partici pant administered an intervention that does not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event therefore can be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an interve ntion, whether or not the incident is considered to be related to the 
intervention . 
 
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
that meets any of the following criteria:  
a. Results in death  
Principal Investigator s: Matt Semler,  Todd Rice

  18 
 b. Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of 
death at the time of the event and NOT an event that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it would have been more severe)  
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
d. Prolongs an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
e. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
f. Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
g. Important medical event that requires an intervention to prevent any of a -f 
above.  
 
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_763142] a daily basis.  He will be available at any time for questions from the bedside 
nurses, who will also be monitoring the patients continuously for adverse events  and 
serious adverse events whic h will be recorded and reported to the IRB .  Adverse events 
will be recorded in a case report form in the study record and serious adverse events 
will be recorded in a case report form and reported to the IRB within 10 business days.  
   In addition, a  clinical investigator experienced in monitoring an d conducting 
clinical trials in critically ill patients will serve as the Data Safety Monitor  (DSM) and will 
be available to oversee the study.  In addition to  assisting the PI [INVESTIGATOR_763143] , the DSM will also perform the single inte rim analysis .  If the data meet 
the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_763144], the DSM will communicate a 
recommendation to stop the trial at that time.  In add ition, the DSM  will also be 
available to review serious adverse events in a timely man ner.  They will be asked to be 
available for rapid access by [CONTACT_763225].  Furthermore, 
in cases of serious adverse events, the DSM w ill have the ability to pause the trial to 
investigate possible safety issues and/or suggest changes to the design of the study to 
abrogate any safety issues.  
 
 
11.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
Patients can be withdrawn from study participation in the fol lowing circumstances:  
 The investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn  for safety 
considerations . 
 There is a significant protocol viol ation in the judgment of the PI.  
 
The reason and date of every withdrawal will be recorded in the patient stu dy records.  
Follow -up will be performed for all patients who discontinue due to an adverse event or 
any other safety parameter.  Follow -up will also be performed for all patients who end 
participation in the protocol for another reason, but who also have an adverse event or

  [ADDRESS_1045746] commonly described organ injury associated with the use of 
unbalanced fluids  (7).  Major Adverse Kidney Events  (MAKE 30) is a composite outcome 
defined or more of the following: death, new use of renal replacement therapy, or 
persistence of renal dysfunction at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_352745] 30 days (defined as an 
increase in serum crea tinine ≥ 200% from baseline)  (26,27).  This composite outcome 
focused on renal injury has been proposed as an meaningful endpoint for clinical trials 
as all of these outcomes are patient -centered, are well suited for an intervention that 
begins early in a patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779], and these outcomes have established 
criterion validity in their known association with other poor outcomes in patients with 
kidney disease such as cardiovascular disease and poor quality of life (27).      
 
Sample Size  
In clinica l practice, the use of balanced intravenous fluids instead of chloride -rich fluids 
is an intervention with no increased cost and both types of fluids are equally available to 
the practitioner.  Therefore any difference between treatment groups is clinicall y 
meaningful in regards to the MAKE 30 primary endpoint.  In previous studies using the 
MAKE 30 composite endpoint in critically ill patients (26), the development of this 
endpoint occurred at a rate of 22%.    
 
SMART -MED  is anticipated to enroll between 3,00 0 and 3,600 patients over the one 
year study period.  Barring logistical difficulties, SMART -SURG  is anticipated to enroll 
between 5,000 and 6,500 patients over the one year study period.  Enrollment of 8,000 
patients in the SMART study overall would allow  detection of a difference of 2.6% in the 
incidence of the primary endpoint with 80% power using a type I error of 0.05.  
Enrollment of 3,000 patients in the SMART -MED  study alone would allow detection of a 
difference of 4.2% in the primary endpoint with 8 0% power using a type I error rate of 
0.05 (Figure 12A).   We will use the Fisher’s exact test to compare the rates of the 
MAKE 30 composite outcome between treatment groups.

Data Analysis Plan  
All data from patients enrolled in the study will be analyzed in an intention -to-treat 
fashion.  If both SMART -MED  and SMART -SURG  are able to be completed, they will be 
analyzed together with baseline characteristics , on-study variables, and outcomes 
presented for the overall population  (SMART)  by [CONTACT_763227].  If SMART -
SURG  is unable to be conducted to due logistical issues, the SMART -MEDCICAL trial will 
be analyzed independently with no change to the data a nalysis plan ex cept exclusion of 
the subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_763228].  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will include age, gender, race, primary 
diagnosis thought to be causing critical illness, secondary active m edical problems, 
amount and type of intravenous fluid given prior to enrollment, presence of and stage 
of AKI, comorbidities, baseline vital signs and laboratories, baseline APACHE II and SOFA 
scores.  Descriptive statistics, including mean and standard de viation, median, 
interquartile ranges, minimum and maximum, and the number and percent of subjects 
in specified categories will be used to summarize the demographic and baseline 
variables for the three study arms separately.  These will be compared between  groups 
using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests  for continuous variables and Chi -square test (or Fisher’s 
exact Test) for categorical variables. All statistical analyses will be done using the 
statistical software  R, IBM SPSS, or Stata .

 0.9% saline only.  Blocks will be only one month in length to minimize the effect of 
seasonal variability .   
 Thirty days after the conclusion of the sixth month of the study , the DSMB will 
review  one interim analysis  to determine if further study is warranted .  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_763149] (1) the difference in the incidence of the primary 
outcome (MAKE30)  between groups is greater than or equal to 2.6% with a p value less 
than 0.001  AND (2) the p value is less than 0.[ADDRESS_1045749] modification.  The primary analysis of the composite MAKE 30 outcome will 
occur in all patients enrolled in the trial; howeve r as secondary analyses, the following 
subgroups will be analyzed separately in regards to the MAKE 30 and secondary clinical 
outcomes:  
1. Patients with any amount of AKI on enrollment  
2. Patients who received any amount of non -assigned intravenous fluids either 
prior to or after enrollment (for example, patients who receive 0.9% saline in 
the ER prior to ICU admission where they are then assigned to the balanced 
fluids group)  
3. Subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_763229] (medical, trauma, surgical, cardiovascular, 
neuro) ** 
4. Patients never requiring renal replacement therapy during the trial period  
5. Patients never requiring vasoactive infusions for hypotension  
6. Diabetic ketoacidosis present on ICU admission  
7. Head trauma

  [ADDRESS_1045750] of physiologically balanced isotonic fluids compared with 0.9% saline on the 
development of major adverse kidney events at 30 days.  Each ICU will be initially 
randomized to a fluid group (0.9% Saline versus physiologically -balanced isotonic f luid) 
and will then crossover  11 times between groups during the one year study period 
(Figure  12B).  This cluster randomized design will accomplish the following: 1 ) Fluids are 
randomly assigned in one month blocks regardless of season and ICU volume, 2 ) The 
one month block length will minimize any possible interaction between fluid type and 
seasonal variation in ICU diagnoses and, 3 ) Prevents any amount of selection bias by [CONTACT_763230].  The block assignments will be randomly generated for  each ICU, 
however the ICU staff, treating teams, and study staff will not be blinded to the 
randomization scheme and study group assignments once it is created.  This has the 
theoretical potential of introducing both a selection bias and observer bias int o this 
study; however we are protected against given that all ICU patients with fluid orders are 
automatically enrolled in the study and the MAKE [ADDRESS_1045751] to observer interpretation.

Statistical Considerations  
Continuous variables will be described as median and 95% confidence intervals (bootstrapped) 
and number and percentage for categorical variables.  All between group comparisons with 
continuous variables will be performed using Wilcoxon Rank -sum tests and Fisher’s exact test 
for categorical variables.   In regards to repeatedly measured variables, changes between groups 
will be compared using generalized estimating equations (GEE).  Kapla n-Meier curves and log -
rank tests will be used to analyze time -to-event comparisons between groups.  Prespecified 
subgroups as outlined above will be compared in regards to the type of fluids received and the 
MAKE [ADDRESS_1045752] for 
interaction using logistic regression will also be performed for that particular subgroup analysis

1.0 Study Summary  
 
Title: Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal  Events Trial (S MART) 
 
Study Aims:  
 Primary: To compare  the effect of saline  versus balanced crystalloid s on the 
development  of major adverse kidney  events within  30 days  (MAKE 30) in 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit  
 Secondary: To evaluate the effect s of th e same intervention in the same 
population on secondary outcomes.  
 
Study Hypotheses:  
 Primary : Use of balanced crystalloid s for intravenous  fluid administration among 
ICU patients will decrease the development  of MAKE 30 compared with use of 
saline  
 Secondary: Use of balanced crystalloid for intravenous fluid administration 
among ICU patients will d ecrease the incidence of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], decrease 
the incidence of acute kidney injury, decrease the incidence of new RRT, and 
decrease the incidence of persistent renal dysfunction.  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Admitted to an adult intensive care unit (ICU ) at Vanderbilt University Medical 
Center  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Age < 18 years  
 
Study Population:   All adult patients admitted to an adult ICU at VUMC  
 
Consent:  Given the current use of all isotonic solutions studied in routine clinical 
practice, the lack o f established risk or benefit with any solution, the impracticability of 
obtaining informed consent prior to recei pt of intravenous fluid in every critically ill 
patient admitted to VUMC , and randomization at the level of the intensive care unit , a 
waiver of informed consent will be requested.  
 
Randomization:   Each ICU  will be  initially  randomized to a fluid group ( saline vs 
balanced crystalloids ) and will then crossover between fluid groups every month during 
the study period.

 Study Interventions : 
 Saline Group:  Patients in an ICU randomized to saline for  whom a provider  
orders isotonic crystalloid will receive the ordered volume of 0.9% sodium 
chloride . 
 
 Balanced Crystalloid Group : Patients in an ICU randomized to balanced 
crystalloids for whom a provid er orders isotonic crystalloid  will receive the 
ordered volume of Plasma -Lyte A® or lactated Ringer’s  unless a pre -specified 
contraindication is present  (see below) . 
 
Primary Endpoint:    
 Develop ment of major adverse kidney event s by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_53767] d ay 30  
(MAKE 30).  A major adverse kidney  event is defined as at least one of the 
following: mortality, need for new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal 
dysfunction at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (defined as  final serum creatinine  ≥ 
200% of baseline ). 
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
1. In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763151], before [ADDRESS_1045759] serum creatinine value  
12. Final serum creatinine value  before  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 30 days  
13. Serum values for sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, 
and creatinine from enrollment through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 30 days  
14. Urinary biomarkers of pre -renal and intra -renal acute renal failure

 hypothesized to be explained by [CONTACT_763214]15 in which the 
hydrogen ion con centration in the plasma is  determined by [CONTACT_763215], weak acids (primarily protein), and the balance of 
sodium, potassium , magnesium, calcium, chloride, and lactate ions known as the strong 
ion difference.  In this understanding, increasing concentrations of chloride relative to 
sodium decrease the strong ion difference and increase the hydrogen ion concentration 
contributin g to metabolic acidosis.

higher chloride solutions to decreased urine output23 and increased urinary markers of 
kidney injury24.  A randomized  controlled trial of lactated Ringer’s versus saline  in

single intensive care unit transitioning from use of higher to lower chloride solutions

  [ADDRESS_1045763]  of isotonic crystalloid composition on  clinical 
outcomes of critically ill adults , a randomized controlled trial is needed.  
 
 Primary Aim: To compare the effect of balanced crystalloids  versus saline  on the 
development of major adverse kidney events by 30 days (MAKE 30) among  
inten sive care unit patients  
 
 Secondary Aim: To evaluate the effect of the same intervention in the same 
population on secondary outcomes.  
 
To complete these aims, we will enroll  patients from participating  ICUs at Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center in a clus ter-randomized , multiple -crossover trial of  balanced 
crystalloid (lactated Ringer’s or Plasma -Lyte A® ) versus saline . 
 
 
4.0 Previous Human Studies  
 Increasing recognition of the potential  differences in “isotonic” intravenous 
fluids has led to several prior st udies examining chloride concentration in IV fluid in 
humans.  As detailed above, prior studies have examined the role of fluid chloride 
content in healthy human volunteers, patients undergoing surgery, patients with septic 
shock, and critically ill patien ts generally.  The above studies provide the rationale for a 
large, prospective randomized controlled trial of isotonic crystalloids with higher versus 
lower chloride content in the critically ill.   
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1045764] to death, new RRT, or persistent renal 
dysfunction.  The participating ICUs will be randomized to utilization of 0.9% sodium 
chloride or balance d crystalloids (lactate d Ringers or Plasma -Lyte A® ).  Every patient 
admitted to an ICU at Vanderbilt Medical Center during the study period who meets no 
exclusion criteria will be enrolled and will receive the assigned study fluid if isotonic 
crystalloid is ordered by [CONTACT_763231] -specified 
contraindications are present.  All other  decision s regarding fluid administration

  [ADDRESS_1045765] the use of oral fluids or other  IV fluids.  
Every month each ICU will undergo a cross -over in assigned fluid group such that each 
ICU will experience each fluid group assignment for equal time periods during the  study . 
 For logistical purposes, th e study will be registered as two, independent, parallel , 
randomized, multiple -crossover trials – one for patients enrolled from the medical ICU 
(SMART -MED ) and one for patients enrolled from the other ICUs ( SMART -SURG ).  
Success of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (SALT) in the MICU of establishing the infrastructure needed 
to deliver the study intervention will allow enrollment  in SMART -MED  to begin 
immediately in the MICU .  The initiation of enrollment in the other ICUs ( SMART -SURG ) 
will be dependent on successfully tran sferring the infrastructure for delivery of the 
assigned intervention to these ICUs and is anticipated to be delayed [ADDRESS_1045766] an  identical 
design, intervention, and data collection to allow for analysis of all patients concurrently  
in accordance with a single, pre-specified data -analysis plan .   
 
 
6.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
6.1  Inclusion Criteria:   Admitted to an adult  intensive care unit (ICU) at Vanderbilt 
University Medica l Center  
 
6.2  Exclusion Criteria:   Age<18 years old  
 
 
7.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 
7.1 Study Sites:   Patients for this st udy will be enrolled upon admission to the

  9 
 7.3  Enrollment:  All adult patients will be enrolled in thi s cluster -randomized, 
multiple -crossover trial at the time of admission to the participating  ICU prior to the 
administration of any IV fluid  in the ICU . 
 
7.4  Consent:   
 
  Saline, l actated ringers, and Plasma -Lyte A®  are all intravenous cry stalloids 
currently used in the routine care of patients admitted to the ICUs at Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center.  Currently, no high quality data suggest that choice of 
crystalloid affects clinical outcomes among critically ill adults.  During the SM ART trial, 
each time a study crystalloid is ordered, the study will confirm  that the treating clinician 
does not feel that any study crystalloid is required for the safe treatment of that specific 
patient at that specific point in time.  The trial is felt to pose minimal risk because (1) 
exposure to the study crystalloids occurs only for patients whose treating clinician has 
already decided to administer an IV crystalloid, (2) all of the crystalloid solutions 
examined are already used in routine practice in  the study environment, (3) no 
definitive prior data suggest clinical outcomes are better with one crystalloid relative to 
the others, and (4) the study confirms with every crystalloid order that the treating 
clinician does not feel any one crystalloid typ e is required for safe treatment of the 
patient.  Given the minimal risk, the focus of the study on crystalloid use at an ICU level, 
and the impracticability of consenting each patient admitted to each ICU prior to the 
first administration of crystalloid, a waiver of informed consent was requested.  
 
7.5  Randomization:    
 
Each  month of the study, each ICU will be  assigned to either saline or balanced 
crysta lloids.  So that each ICU will experience an equal number of months assigned to 
saline and balanced cr ystalloids while minimizing monthly imbalances in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s 
overall use of each crystalloid, we will generate  two sequences of study group 
assignment ([1] saline during odd -numbered months and balanced crystalloid during 
even -numbered months; [2] bala nced crystalloid during odd -numbered months and 
saline during even -numbered months) .  We will plan for three ICUs to be assigned to 
one sequence and the remaining two ICUs to the opposite sequence.  To facilitate the 
early administration of the assigned cr ystalloid in the ED and operating room prior to 
the patient’s physical arrival in the ICU, a single computer -generated, simple 
randomization w ill be  performed in which the three ICUs that admit the majority of 
patients from the ED (medical ICU,  trauma ICU,  and surgical ICU) are  randomized ‘en 
bloc’ to one sequence of crystalloid group assignments and the two ICUs that admit the 
majority of patients from the operating room (neurological ICU and cardiac ICU)  are 
randomized ‘en bloc’ to the opposite sequence o f crystalloid group assignments.   
Individual patients will not be randomized for the purposes of this study.  Patients that

Version Date: 6/15/17  
Study Title: Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) 
Institution/Hosp ital: Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
 
  [ADDRESS_1045767] of differing sodium, chloride, and potassium contents of Plasma -Lyte 
A®, lactated Ringer’s, and 0.9% sodium chloride on patients ’ metabolic laboratory 
studies over the course of the ICU stay would make blinding of the treating provider s 
and nursing staff impossible.  Therefore, clinical personnel will not be blinded to the 
study intervention.  However, all on -study and outcome data will be collected by [CONTACT_763220].  
 
 
8.0 Study Procedures  
 
8.1  Treatment Arms  
 
Patients in an ICU randomized to saline  will receive 0.9% sodium chloride whenever 
isotonic intravenous crystalloid administration is ordered by [CONTACT_763221] .  
Patients in an ICU randomized to balanced crystalloid  will receive Plasma -Lyte A® or 
lactated Ringer’s whenever isotonic intravenous fluid administration is ordered by [CONTACT_295884] .  The total volume, rate, initiation, cessation, and addition of 
electrolytes and glucose to the isotonic fluid assigned will be at the discretion of the 
ordering provider .  Adherence with the administration of assigned fluid in the study ICUs 
will be ensured by [CONTACT_763232].  
 
Pharmacy Supply:  
 For the duration of the study, each study ICU will be routinely stocked primarily 
with the isotonic crystalloid assigned for that month .  Upon request, the alternative 
isotonic crystalloid will be available fro m the pharmacy.  
 
Order Entry:  
 For the duration of the study, when a provider begins an order for the 
administration of any isotonic crystalloid  in the electronic order entry system an 
“Isotonic Fluid Wizard ” will : 1) Inform the provider of the stu dy, 2)  Solicit the presence 
of contraindications  to the assigned study fluid, and 3)  If contraindications are not 
present, guide the provider to order the assigned study fluid.  The manner in which fluid 
orders can be customized with regard to total volume, rate,  electrolyte and dextrose 
content will not be affected by [CONTACT_729445].  
 There are no established contraindications to the choice of 0.9% saline once the 
decision has been made to administer an isotonic crystalloid .  Because of the marginally 
higher potassi um content of Plasma -Lyte A®  and lactated Ringer’s, patients being

  11 
 treated for hyperkalemia will be allowed to receive saline regardless of study group .  
Because of the concern for the use of relatively hypotonic solutions in patients with 
elevated intrac ranial pressure, these patients will also be allowed to receive saline 
regardless of study group .  While there may be patients in whom treating provider s 
prefer no t to administer Ca2+ or lactate  (as in lactated Ringer’s) or magnesium (as in 
Plasma -Lyte A® ), because an alternative balanced solution would be available without 
these electrolytes, saline would not be allowed for these indications in those assigned to 
the balanced crystalloid  group.   Instead, the provider would have the option of 
choosing the o ther balanced crystalloid (i.e. choose Plasma -Lyte A®  if worried about 
administering Ca2+ or lactate and choose lactated Ringer’s if worried about 
administering magnesium or acetate).    
The non -assigned crystalloid will  also be made available via the phar macy if a 
formal statement is submitted that the attending physician feels the non -assigned 
crystalloid is required for the safe treatment of a specific patient.

Biomarkers/Specimens:  
 
In order to try to elucidate a potential mechanism of how saline  may cause renal failure 
and/or worse outcomes, analysis of biospecimens will be undertaken.  From a select 
group of patients, urine and plasma that is leftover and to be discarded from the clinical 
laboratory after all ordered labs are performed will be collected  by [CONTACT_3462] .  All 
specimens will be stored frozen at -800C in a locked freezer in a locked freezer room 
until analysis.   Collection and analysis of biospecimens will be dependent on receipt of 
funding.   
 
 
9.0 Risks  and Benefits:  
 
 For patients for whom the treating provider  has ordered the administration of 
isotonic intravenous crystalloid , there are currently no established ris ks or benefits to 
the selection of saline versus balanced crystalloids .  Whether the differences in 
composition  have clinical implications is unknown.  At this time there is no reason to 
believe that participation in this study would expose patient s to gre ater medical risks  or 
benefits  than those experienced by [CONTACT_763233] .  All of the 
intravenous isotonic crystalloids  are used in routine care in all the Vanderbilt adult ICUs.  
The greater benefit of the study would be to so ciety in the form of improved 
understanding of the relative effects of these commonly used intravenous solutions.    
 A potential risk to patients participating in this study involves the collection of 
personal health information.  In order to limit the ass ociated risks, the minimum 
amount of health information necessary for study conduct will be collected.  After 
collection, the data will be stored in a secure online database and will be de -identified 
to protect participant privacy.   In addition, any biospe cimens collected will be stored in 
a secure, locked freezer in a locked room of specimen freezers.  
 
 
10.0 Adverse Events : 
 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investiga tion participant administered an interven tion that does not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event therefore can be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the

 use of an intervention, whether or not the inc ident is considered to be related to the 
intervention . 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that 
meets any of the following criteria:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant  was at risk of 
death at the time of the event and NOT an event that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it would have been more severe)  
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
d. Prolongs an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
e. Results in persistent or significant disa bility or incapacity  
f. Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
g. Important medical e vent that requires an intervention to prevent any of a -f 
above.  
 
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_456903] a daily basi s.  He will be available at any time for questions from the bedside 
nurses, who will also be monitoring the patients continuously for adverse events  and 
serious adverse events .  Serious and unexpected adverse events associated with study 
interventions will  be recorded in a case report form in the study record and reported to 
the IRB within [ADDRESS_1045771] (DSMB) will be  appointed to 
oversee the conduct of the trial .  The DSMB will be  comprised of two academic 
intensivists outside the study institution experienced in the conduct of clinical trials in 
critical illnes s.  The DSM B will be available to review serious adverse events  related to 
the study intervention  in a timely manner.  They will be asked to be available for rapid 
access by [CONTACT_763234].  Furthermore, in cases of serious 
adverse events  related to the study intervention , the DSM B will have the ability to 
pause the trial to investigate possible safety issues and/or suggest changes to the design 
of the study to abrogate any safety issues.

 11.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
Patients can be withdrawn from study participation in the following circumstances:  
 The investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn  for safety 
consideration s. 
 There is a significant protocol viol ation in the judgment of the PI.  
 
The reason and date of every withdrawal will be recorded in the study records.  Follow -
up will be performed for all patients who discontinue due to an adverse event or any 
other safet y parameter.  Follow -up will also be performed for all patients who end 
participation in the protocol for another reason, but who also have an adverse event or 
other safety parameter that could have led to discontinuation.  Follow -up will be 
conducted unti l the condition has resolved, until diagnosis of the adverse event or 
safety parameter is deemed chronic and stable, or as long as clinically appropriate.  This 
follow -up will be documented in the patient study record as well.  
 
 
12.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Although the artificial induction of a hyperchloremic and acidemic state by [CONTACT_763235] -rich intravenous fluids can be potentially injurious to all organ systems, kidney 
injury has bee n the primary focus of prior research comparing saline to bala nced 
crystalloids (7).  Major Adverse Kidney Events (MAKE 30) is a composite outcome defined 
by [CONTACT_10980]: death, new use of renal replacement therapy, or 
persistence of renal dysfunction at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_352745] 30 days (defined as a  final  
serum creatinine ≥ 200% the baseline  value ) (26,27).  This composite outcome focused 
on renal injury has been proposed as an meaningful endpoint for clinical trials as all of 
these outcomes are patient -centered, are well suited for an intervention th at begins 
early in a patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779], and these outcomes have established criterion 
validity in their known association with other poor outcomes in patients with kidney 
disease such as cardiovascular disease and poor quality of life (27).      
 
Final Sample Size Justification   
(Protocol Amendment 5/10/1 6; Published with Statistical Analysis Plan  3/16/17)  
As a cluster -randomized, multiple -crossover trial, SMART will enroll for a fixed 
duration to account for seasonal effects and ensure an equal num ber of study periods in 
which each study unit is assigned to each study arm.  The final planned study duration is  
82 unit -months over a calendar period of two years.  The total number of patients 
enrolled will depend on the rate of admission s to study ICUs  during the fixed time 
period of the trial.   
Principal Investigator s: Matt Semler,  Todd Rice    
Version Date: 6/15/17  
Study Title: Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) 
Institution/Hosp ital: Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
 
  18 
 Based on data from the study ICUs in the year prior to the trial, we anticip ated 
that the final  planned study duration  of 82 unit -months  would  result in enrollment of 
around 14,000 patients with an overall rate  of MAKE30 around 15%.  En rollment of 
14,000 patients  would provide 90% power at an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_1045772] an 
absolute difference between the saline and balanced crystalloid groups in MAKE30 of 
1.9%, a relative  risk reduction of 12%.   This relative risk reduction is similar to the 
relative risk reduction reported in prior research comparing balanced crystalloid to 
saline among critically ill adults.  
 
Final Anticipated Sample Size   
(Protocol Amendment 3/29/17)  
As a cluster -randomized, multiple -crossov er trial, SMART w ill enroll for a fixed 
duration, [ADDRESS_1045773] 15,000 
and no more than 16,500 patients will be enrolled d uring the planned study period.  
  
Final Data Analysis Plan  
(Published with Statistical Analysis Plan  3/16 /17) 
All analyses will be performed using R version 3.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria).  All analyses will be conducted at the level of the individual 
patient during an individual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763154] -to-treat fashion unless 
otherwise specified.  Continuous variables will be reported as mean ± standard 
deviation, mean and 95% confidence interval, or median and interquartile range; 
categorical variables as frequencies and proportions.  Between -group comparisons will 
be made with the Mann -Whitney rank sum test for continuous variables, chi -square test 
for categorical variables, generalized estimating equations for repeatedly measured 
variables, and generalized linear mixed -effects models  for analyses of the primary and 
secondary outcomes.  A two -sided P value < 0.05 will be considered to be statistically 
significant. As a large, pragmatic trial enrolling every adult admitted to the five 
participating intensive care units, the SMART study population will contain a wide 
spectrum of (1) exposure to the study intervention, (2) baseline risk of the primary 
outcome, and (3) physiologically -distinct patient subgroups.   The primary and 
secondary analyses evaluate the effect of the intervention ov erall and across the 
spectrum of exposure to crystalloid, baseline risk of MAKE30, and patient subgroups.  
 
Primary Analysis  
 To account for the cluster -level -allocation, cluster -level -crossover structure of 
the trial, the primary analysis will be an intent ion-to-treat comparison of the primary 
outcome of MAKE30 between the saline and balanced crystalloid groups using a 
Principal Investigator s: Matt Semler,  Todd Rice    
Version Date: 6/15/17  
Study Title: Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) 
Institution/Hosp ital: Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
 
  19 
 generalized linear mixed -effects model including fixed effects (group assignment, age, 
gender, race, source of admission, mechanical ventila tion, vasopressor receipt, 
diagnosis of sepsis, and diagnosis of traumatic brain injury) and random effects 
(intensive care unit).  
 
Main Secondary Analysis  
Anticipating (1) a wide range in the total volume of crystalloid received by [CONTACT_763236] (2) the potential for greater difference in outcomes between study 
groups among those patients who receive larger volumes of crystalloid, the main 
secondary analysis will compare the proportion of patients experiencing MAKE30 in the 
saline and balanced cry stalloid groups, accounting for patients’ overall volume of 
isotonic crystalloid received.  For this analysis, we will construct a logistic regression 
model with MAKE30 as the outcome and independent variables of study group, total 
isotonic crystalloid rec eived between enrollment and 30 days, and the interaction 
between the two (as a cross -product term).  This will allow us to determine whether any 
volume of crystalloid receipt exists at which use of balanced crystalloids decreases the 
risk of MAKE30 compar ed with saline.  
Given that total crystalloid receipt is a variable that emerges after enrollment, 
we will perform sensitivity analyses (1) using total crystalloid receipt in the 72 hours 
after enrollment (before incident acute kidney injury or death are li kely to have affected 
isotonic crystalloid administration), (2) replacing the actual total crystalloid receipt with 
predicted total crystalloid receipt based on a multivariable linear regression model using 
patient and ICU characteristics available at the time of enrollment derived from 
crystalloid administration in the study ICUs in the year prior to the trial, and (3) 
comparing outcomes between study groups among a “modified intention -to-treat” 
population of patients who received at least [ADDRESS_1045774] udy crystalloid in the 72 
hours after enrollment.  
 
Additional Secondary Analyses  
We will perform the following additional secondary analyses:  
(1) Comparison of secondary outcomes between study groups.  
(2) Effect modification by [CONTACT_763237] -specifi ed subgroups.   Using 
generalized linear mixed effects modeling, we will examine the interaction 
between crystalloid assignment and the following baseline variables with respect 
to the primary outcome of MAKE30 in the intention -to-treat population:  
a. Source of admission to the ICU (Emergency department, Operating room, 
Transfer from another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494], Other)  
b. Study ICU (Medical, Surgical, Cardiac, Neurological, Trauma).  [Because 
cluster cannot be treated as a random effect for this subgroup, we will use 
logistic regression modeling]  
c. Sepsis or septic shock (Yes, No)

  20 
 d. Traumatic brain injury (Yes, No)  
e. Receipt of mechanical ventilation (Yes, No)  
f. Receipt of vasopressors (Yes, No)  
g. Category of renal dysfunction at the time of enrollment (No renal 
dysfunc tion, Acute kidney injury, Chronic kidney disease, End -stage renal 
disease receiving RRT)  
h. Risk of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763155] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380] (continuous 
variable ranging 0.0 to 1.0)  
(3) Sens itivity analysis excluding patients admitted in the week prior to a crossover 
(‘washout’).   We will repeat the primary analysis comparing MAKE30 between 
study groups in the intention to treat population excluding those admitted in the 
7 days prior to a cro ssover in ICU crystalloid assignment (simulating a “washout” 
period).  Prior data from the study ICUs suggests that less than 10% of patients 
remain in the ICU for longer than 7 days.  Excluding those admitted within 7 days 
of a crossover in ICU crystalloi d assignment will allow use of a baseline factor to 
exclude the majority of patients who would go on to experience a crossover in 
crystalloid assignment due to the study design.   
(4) Sensitivity analysis excluding patients who were transferred between ICUs or  
remained in the ICU through a crossover (‘per protocol’).   We will repeat the 
primary analysis comparing MAKE30 between study groups in the intention to 
treat population excluding those who remained in the intensive care unit 
through a crossover in crysta lloid assignment or were transferred between study 
ICUs.  
(5) Sensitivity analysis including only each patient’s first admission to a participating 
intensive care unit during the study period.  We will repeat the primary analysis 
comparing MAKE30 between study g roups in the intention to treat population 
including only the first ICU admission in the study for each patient.  
 
Corrections for multiple testing  
 All of the additional secondary analyses will be considered hypothesis -generating 
and no corrections for mul tiple comparisons will be performed.   
 
Handling of Missing Data  
 Of the components of the MAKE30 primary outcome, data regarding in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763156].  In con trast, the persistent renal dysfunction component of 
MAKE30 may suffer from missing data for serum creatinine value at baseline or 
between enrollment and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 974 patients in the same 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 31 patients (3.2%) had no measured serum creatinine between enrollment and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Of these 31 patients, 6 (19.4%) died within hours of ICU admission

  21 
 and qualified for the MAKE30 outcome via the in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763157].  The 
remaining 25 (80.6%) were low acuity ICU patients with a normal creatinine value 
measured in the [ADDRESS_1045775] to missing data for baseline serum creatinine, in the same pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480] 595 of 974 patients (61.0%) had a measured serum creatinine value between 12 
months and 24 hours prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  Of those wi thout such a 
measurement, 259 of 379 (68.3%) had a value measured between 24 hours prior to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763158].  Only 120 of 974 patients (12.3%) did not have 
an available serum creatinine value prior to enrollment.  For the main analy sis, patients 
without a measured serum creatinine value between [ADDRESS_1045776] creatinine during the study.  
 
Final Plan for  Interim Analyses   
(Protocol Amendment 5/10/16 , Published with Statistical Analysis Plan  3/16 /17) 
 With the final study duration of [ADDRESS_1045777] interim analysis and the end 
of the trial.  Both interim analyses will use the same stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_763149] (1) the unadjusted difference in the incid ence of the 
primary outcome (MAKE30) between study groups is greater than or equal to 2.6% with 
a P value less than 0.001 AND (2) the P value is less than 0.001 for the difference 
between study groups in the incidence of either in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763159].  As even small differences between groups would be clinically meaningful, and 
given the importance of determining with as much certainty as possible whether 
balanced crystalloids are superior to saline, a futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_763160] t be 
employed.  Use of the conservative Haybittle -Peto boundary (P < 0.001) will allow the 
final analysis to be performed using an unchanged le vel of significance (P = 0.05).

 INTRODUCTION   
 The administration of intravenous  (IV) fluid is ubiquitous in the care of the 
critically ill [1].  Globally, 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) is the most common resuscitation 
fluid, but  recent data have associated saline  with hyperchloremia [2,3], metabolic 
acidosis and renal vasoco nstriction [4,5], acute kidney injury and renal replacement 
therapy  (RRT) [6], and increased mortality [7,8].  While several o bservational 
studies [7,9–11], a before -and-after trial [6], and meta -analyses [8,12]  suggested  
increased rate s of acute kidney injury, RRT receipt, and death  with saline compared to 
balanced crystalloids,  two recent randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_763162] [13,14] .  The number of patients enrolled in these 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_763163], but potentially clinically meaningful, 
differences in patient outcomes between saline a nd balanced crystalloids .  Thus , the 
optimal choice of isotonic crystalloid for the treatment of critically ill adults remains 
unknown [15,16] .  To determine the impact of balanced crystalloids compared with  
saline on clinical outcomes  among  critically ill adults , a large , prospective , controlled 
trial is needed [13,17] . 
 The current trial aims  to compare the effect of balanced crystalloids  versus saline  
on the development of major a dverse kidney events (the composite of death, new RRT, 
or persis tent renal dysfunction) among intensive care unit  (ICU) patients.  Secondary 
aims  are to evaluate the effect of balanced crystalloids  versus saline  on laboratory 
values (serum chloride, serum bicarbonate, serum creatinine), organ injury (acute 
kidney injur y, receipt of RRT), and additional clinical outcomes (ventilator -free days, 
ICU-free days, in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]).   We hypothesize that use of bala nced crystalloids 
among ICU patients will reduce the incidence of major adverse kidney events.

 METHODS  
 
Design  
 The Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) is a 
prospective,  unblinded,  pragmatic, cluster -level-allocation , cluster -level-crossover trial 
being conducted between June  1, 2015 and April 30, 2017  in five ICUs at Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center in Nashville, TN.  SMART  compares  saline  (0.9% sodium 
chloride)  to balanced crystalloids (Lactated ringers and Plasma -Lyte A® ) with regard to 
the primary outcome o f Major Adverse Kidney Events within  30 days (MAKE30) – the 
composite of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473], receipt of new RRT, or persistent renal dysfunction 
(discharge creatinine ≥ 200% of baseline creatinine) .  Consistent with the concept of a 
pragmatic clinical trial [18,19] , eligibility criteria are broad, the sample size is large, and 
study procedures  are embedded into routine care and executed by [CONTACT_261571].  
The trial was approved by [CONTACT_763239] (IRB) with waiver of informed consent (IRB#141349).  The trial was registered 
with ClinicalTr ials.gov prior to initiation of patient enrollment ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is 
monitoring the progress and safety of the trial. The trial is investigator -initiated with 
funding provided by [CONTACT_763240] a Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) from the National Center for 
Advancing Translational Sciences (UL1 TR000445).  
 
Study Sites  and Period  
 SMART is being conducted  in five  academic  ICUs at Vande rbilt University 
Medical Center:  a 34-bed medical ICU, a  22-bed neurological and neurosurgical ICU, a 
27-bed cardiovascular ICU, a 31-bed trauma ICU, and a 22-bed surgical ICU .  
Participating ICUs began  enrollment sequentially over t he first year of the study  (Figure 
1).  Each ICU will enroll patients for at least 12 months  and will enroll for an equal 
number of saline and balanced crystalloid months.  
   
6 
 Population  
 All adults (age ≥ 18 years) admitted to a participating ICU at Vanderbilt University 
Medical Center during the study period are enrolled at the time of ICU admission.  
Enrolled patients who are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763164] a participating ICU again during the study period.   
 
Consent  
 Saline, Lactated ringers, and Plasma -Lyte A® are a ll intravenous crystalloids 
currently used in the routine care of patients admitted to the ICUs at Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center .  Currently, no high quality data suggest that choice of 
crystalloid affects clinical outcomes among critically ill adults.  During the SMART trial, 
each time a study crystalloid is ordered, the study confirm s that the treating clinician 
does not feel that any study crystalloid is required for the safe treatment of that specific 
patient at that specific point in time (see Study Interventions ).  The trial is felt to pose 
minimal risk b ecause (1) exposure to the study crystalloids occur s only for patients 
whose treating clinician has already decided to administer an IV crystalloid, (2) all of the 
crystalloid solutions examined are already used in routine practice in the study 
environment, (3) no definitive prior d ata suggest clinical outcomes are better with one 
crystalloid relative to the other s, and (4) the study confirm s with every crystalloid order 
that the treating clinician does not feel any one  crystalloid type is required for safe 
treatment of the patient .  Given the minimal risk, the focus of the study on crystalloid 
use at an ICU level, and the impracticability of consenting each patient admitted to each 
ICU prior to the first administration of crystalloid,  a waiver of informed consent was 
granted by [CONTACT_941] V anderbilt institutional review board ( IRB# 141349).  
 
Randomization and Allocation  
 Each month of the study, each ICU is assigned to either saline or balanced 
crystalloids.   So that each ICU would experience an equal number of months assigned 
to saline and balanced crystalloids while minimizing monthly imbalances in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s overall use of each crystalloid, we generated two sequences of study group 
assignment ( [1] saline during odd -numbered months and balanced crystalloid during 
7 
 even -numbered months;  [2] balanced crystalloid during odd -numbered months and 
saline during even -numbered months) and planned for t hree ICUs to be assigned to one 
sequence and the remaining two ICUs to the opposite sequence.   To facilitate the early 
administration of the assigned crystalloid in the ED and operating room prior to the 
patient’s physical arrival in the ICU, a single computer -generated, simple randomization 
was performed in which the  three ICUs that admit the majority of patients from the ED 
(medical ICU, trauma ICU, and surgical ICU) were randomized ‘en bloc’ to one 
sequence of crystalloid group assignments and the two ICUs that admit the majority of 
patients from the operating room (neurological ICU and cardiac ICU) were randomized 
‘en bloc’ to the opposite sequence  of crystalloid group assignments (Figure s 1-2).  
 
Concealment and Blinding  
As available laboratory values overtly reflect the crystalloid being used and prior 
studies hav e shown high levels of provider awareness of crystalloid assignment despi[INVESTIGATOR_763165] [13], patients, clinicians, and  investigators are not  blinded to 
crystalloid assignment.  A ll study data , including the objective primary outcome , will be 
electronically extracted from the medical record  in an automated manner unaffected by 
[CONTACT_737333] . 
 
Study Interventions  
Study protocol determine s only the choice of intravenous isotonic crystalloid: 
0.9% sodium chloride (saline group) versus the treating clinician’s preference of 
Lactated Ringer’s solution or Plasma -Lyte A ® (balanced crystalloid group).  
Composition of each crystalloid solution is displayed in Table E1.  Lactated Ringer’s and 
Plasma -Lyte A® are the balanced crystalloids commonly available in the United 
States [20].  Lactated Ringer’s and Plasma -Lyte A®  both offer a significantly lower 
chloride content than saline , but other minor differences in composition lead some 
clinicians to prefer one balanced crys talloid or the other  for particular patients (e.g., 
some clinicians prefer Plasma -Lyte A® over Lactated Ringer’s for patients receiving 
blood transfusion) [21].  Allowing clinicians to select either Lactated Ringer ’s or Plasma -
Lyte A®  when a balanced crystalloid is assigned is anticipated to improve compliance 
8 
 with balanced crystalloid assignment and emulate  how balanced crystalloids are used in 
practice while maintaining relevant comparator groups consisting of crysta lloid with a 
higher chloride content  (saline) versus crystalloids with a lower chloride content 
(Lactated Ringer’s and Plasma -Lyte A® ).  Decisions regarding crystalloid rate, volume, 
and additive content are deferred to treating clinicians.  
Delivery of the  assigned crystalloid to patients occur s via interventions in 
pharmacy supply and clinician order entry.  Each month, the dispensing cabinets within 
the ICUs are stocked with 1000 -mL bags of the assigned crystalloid.  Additionally, any 
order for intravenou s crystalloid for a patient located in a study ICU trigger s an advisor 
application within the electronic order entry system.  The advisor application  inform s 
providers about the study, ask s about relative contraindications to the assigned 
crystalloid, and (if relative contraindi cations a re not present) guide s providers to order 
the assigned crystalloid.  Accepted relative contraindications for patients assigned to 
balanced crystalloid include (1) “hyperkale mia” and (2) “brain injury”.  The severity of 
“hyperkalemia ” and “brain injury” at which saline will be used in favor of balanced 
crystalloids is determined by [CONTACT_68071].   The non -assigned crystalloid is also 
made available via the pharmacy if a formal statement is submitted that the atten ding 
physician feels the non -assigned crystalloid is required for the safe treatment of a 
specific patient.   
Although the study focuses on crystalloid use in t he ICU, crystalloid 
administration  prior to ICU admission in the emergency department or operati ng room 
may introduce contamination and limit separation between  study arms.   Therefore, 
between January 1, 2016 and April 30, 2017, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center 
Emergency Department (ED) is coordinating  their crystalloid use with the medical, 
surgical, and trauma ICUs such that patients admitted to those units from the ED begin 
receiving the assigned crystalloid during evaluation and management in the ED 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   Clinical outcomes of patients treated with study crystalloids in the ED 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763166].   Similarly, to 
the extent that is logistically feasible, for patients identified in the operating room as 
coming from or being admitted to one of the participating ICUs , the request is made that 
they receive  the fluid assigned to the corresponding  ICU during their operative 
9 
 procedure .  Fluid administered prior to enrollment by [CONTACT_763241][INVESTIGATOR_600], and fluid administered after discharge from the ICU, is not 
controlled by [CONTACT_1758].  
Each day patients  receive  the crystalloid to which the ir ICU is currently assigned.  
The necessity  that an intravenous crystalloid be clinically available at all times  
precluded the use of  washout period s and patients who remain  in the ICU through a 
crossover (i.e., from one calendar month to another) may potentially be exposed  to both 
types of crystalloid.  Although this introduces the potential for contamination of study 
groups, in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_763167], the total  volume of non -assigned crystalloid 
administered due to the lack of a washout period was less than 125 mL per patient [14].  
As described  in the Statistical Analysis  section below, patients will be analyzed in the 
group to which they were assigned at the time of study enrollment  in an intention -to-
treat fashion (e.g., a patient admitted to an ICU during a month assigned to saline will 
be analyzed in the saline group even if that patient remains in the ICU after  the ICU 
switches assignment to balanced crystalloids).  
 
Data Collection  
This pragmatic trial use s data collected via routine clinical care and electronically 
extracted from the electronic health record (EHR) .  All data are stored confidentially in 
an institutional patient data management system.  Data collected include : pre-study 
renal function; demographic characteristics, admitting location and diagnosis, and 
severity of illness at enrollment; receipt of intravenous cryst alloids, other fluids, and 
blood products; serum electrolyte and creatinine values; receipt of RRT, mechanical 
ventilation, and vasopressors; and vital status and serum creatinine at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].  Electronic extraction of these  data from the EHR has  been previously 
validated against the reference standard of two -physician manual chart review [22].  For 
all patients who receive  new RRT, study personnel will perform  manual chart review to 
confirm the absence of prior RRT and identify  the indication  for RRT.  
 
10 
 Primary Outcome  
 The primary outcome  will be the proportion of patients meeting one or more 
criteri a for Major Adverse Kidney Events within the 30 days after enrollment (MAKE30): 
in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], receipt of new RRT, or persistent renal dysfunction defined as a 
final inpatient serum creatinine value ≥ 200% of baseline [22–24].  In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763168] [ADDRESS_1045786] received RRT prior to ICU admission .  Persistent renal 
dysfunction will be defined as a final serum creatinine value before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] 
(censored at 30 days after en rollment) ≥ 200% of the baseline creatinine value.  The 
value for baseline serum creatinine will be determined using a previously -described 
hierarchical approach [22].  The lowest serum creatinine between [ADDRESS_1045787] creatinine value between 24 h prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763169].  If no creatinine value is available between 12 
months prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763170], a baseline creatinine 
value will be estimated using a previously -described  formula [creatinine = 0.74 − 0.2 (if 
female) + 0.08 (if African American) + 0.003 × age (in years)] [25].  Patients known to 
have received  RRT prior to enrollment w ill be considered ineligible to meet criteria for 
new RRT or persistent renal dysfunction , but may quali fy for MAKE30 by [CONTACT_763242]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380] .  
 
Secondary Outcomes  
Secondary outcomes will include additional clinical outcomes, additional renal 
outcomes, and biochemical outcomes.  Additional clinical outcomes will include in-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763151], before 30 days, and before 60 days ; ICU-free 
days, ven tilator -free days, vasopressor -free days, and RRT -free days, all through  28 
days after enrollment .  Additional renal outcomes will include  new RRT receipt, 
persistent renal dysfunction, stage II or greater AKI by [CONTACT_763243] (K DIGO) creatinine criteria [26], highest serum creatinine value, change f rom 
[ADDRESS_1045788] creatinine,  final serum creatinine value  before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954] , and duration of new RRT.  Biochemical outcomes will include  serum values 
for sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate , blood urea nitrogen, and creatinin e from 
enrollment through day 30 . 
 
Power Calculation  
  Based on data from the study ICUs  in the year prior to the trial, we anticipate the 
planned study duration (Figure 1) will result in enrollment of around 14,000 patients with 
an overall rate of MAKE30 around 15%.   Enrollment of 14,000 patients will provide 90% 
power at an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_1045789] a n absolute  difference  between the saline and 
balanced crystalloid groups  in MAKE30 of 1.9% , a relative risk reduction of 12% , which 
is comparable to the 12% relative risk reduction for in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763171] a 
recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] [13] (additional details in the  Appendix 3 ). 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board and Interim Analysis  
 A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was appointed to oversee the 
conduct of the trial and review two interim analyses.  The DSMB is  comprised of two 
academic intensivists outside the study institution experienced in the conduct of clinical 
trials in critical illness.  The first interim analysis occurred  six months after study 
initiation , examining patients enrolled between June 1, [ADDRESS_1045790] interim analysis and the  
end of the trial, examining patients enrolled between June 1, 2015 and July 31, 2016  
(additional details in the Appendix 4 ).  Both interim ana lyses used  the same stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31732] :  “The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_763172] (1) the unadjusted difference 
in the incidence of the primary outcome (MAKE30) between study groups is greate r 
than or equal to 2.6% with a P  value less than 0.001 A ND (2) the P  value is less than 
0.001 for  the difference between study group s in the incidence of  either in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763173].   As even small differences between groups would be 
clinically meaningful , and given t he importance of determining  with as much certaint y as 
possible whether balanced crystalloids  are superior to saline , a futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_763174] .  Use of the conserv ative Haybittle -Peto boundary (P < 
12 
 0.001) will allow the final analysis to be perform ed using an un changed level of 
significance (P = 0.05). ”  At the time of this submission, both interim analyses have 
been completed and the DSMB has recommended continuing the trial to completion.  
In addition, the DSMB is available to evaluate adverse events or serious adverse 
events  during the conduct of the trial .  In cases of serious adverse events, the DSM B 
has the ability to pause the trial to investigate possible safety issues and suggest 
changes to the design of the study to abrogate any safety i ssues.  
 
Statistical Analysis Principles  
All analyses will be performed using R version 3.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria).  To maximize trans parency and reproducibility, a complete 
version of the R code that will be used to  analyze the  final study  data is avail able in 
Additional File 1 .  This ensures that (1) statistical reviewers or external investigators will 
be able to replicate the pre -specified analysis of the trial independently  and (2) any 
changes or additions to the statistical analysis introduced by [CONTACT_763244] -specified 
code  and the analysis code included with the  final publication.  
All analyses will be conducted at the leve l of the individual patient  during an 
individual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763175] -to-treat fashion unless otherwise specified.   
Continuous variables will be reported as mean ± standard deviation , mean and 95% 
confidence interval,  or median and interquartile  range; categorical variables as 
frequencies and proportions.  Between -group comparisons will be made with the Mann -
Whitney rank sum t est for continuous variables, chi-square test for categorical variables, 
generalized estimating equations for rep eatedly m easured variables, and generalized 
linear mixed -effects models for analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes.   A 
two-sided P value < 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.  
 
Analytic Rationale  
 As a large, pragmatic trial enrolling  every adult admitted to the five participating 
intensive care units , the SMART study population will contain a wide spectrum of (1) 
exposure to the study intervention, (2) baseline risk of the primary outcome, and (3) 
[ADDRESS_1045791] of the intervention overall and across the spectrum of exposure to 
crystalloid, baseline risk of MAKE30,  and patient subgroups.  
 
Primary Analysis  
 To account for the cluster -level-allocation , cluster -level-crossover  structure of the 
trial, the primary analy sis will be an intention -to-treat comparison of the primary 
outcome of MAKE30 between the saline and balanced crystalloid groups using a 
generalized linear mixed -effects model including fixed  effects (group assignment, age, 
gender, race,  source of admission, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor receipt, 
diagnosis of sepsis,  and diagnosis of traumatic brain injury) and random effects 
(intensive care unit)[27,28] . 
In prepara tion for SMART, we electronically collected the same set of variables 
that would be used to analyze SMART from the records of all 11,582 patients admitted 
to the study ICUs between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014.  With the data on 
MAKE30 from the 11 ,582 patients admitted in the year before the trial, using 
generalized linear mixed -effects modeling treating the five ICUs as clusters and the 12 
months as periods, we calculated the intra -cluster correlation coefficient to be 0.142, the 
intra-period corr elation coefficient to be 0.026, and the intra -cluster intra -period 
correlation coefficient to be <0.001.  
Using the data from the 11,582 patients admitted in the year before the trial, we 
performed a series of simulated trials evaluating a variety of trial  conditions and 
potential results including: (1) outcome differences between groups ranging from no 
difference to a 50% relative risk reduction, (2) heterogeneity of treatment effect by 
[CONTACT_118137], (3) change in the incidence of the outcome in the control gro up over the course 
of the trial, (4) varying levels of intra -cluster correlation, and (5) varying levels of intra -
period correlation.  In each case the generalized linear mixed -effect model appeared to 
adequately account for the correlation between partici pants.  Analysis using generalized 
linear mixed -effects modeling and generalized estimating equations accounting for the 
same variables produced identical odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the 
difference between the simulated groups in the prima ry outcome.  
14 
  
Main Secondary Analysis  
Anticipating (1) a wide range in the total volume of crystalloid received by [CONTACT_763236] (2)  the potential for greater difference in outcomes between study 
groups among those patients who receive larger volum es of crystalloid , the main 
secondary analysis will compare the proportion of patients experiencing MAKE30 in the 
saline and balanced crystalloid groups, accounting for patients’ overall volume of 
isotonic crystalloid received.  For this analysis, we will construct  a logistic regression 
model with MAKE30 as the outcome and independent variables of study group, total 
isotonic crystalloid received between enrollment and 30 days, and the interaction 
between the two (as a cross -product term).  This will allow u s to determine whether any 
volume of crystalloid receipt  exists  at which use of balanced crystalloids decreases  the 
risk of MAKE30 compared with  saline.  
Given that total crystalloid receipt is a variable that emerges after enrollment, we 
will perform sensitivity analyses (1) using total crystalloid receipt in the 72 hours after 
enrollment (before incident acute kidney injury or death are likely to have affected 
isotonic crystalloid administration), (2) replacing the actual total crystalloid receipt wit h 
predicted total crystalloid receipt based on a multivariable linear regression model using 
patient and ICU characteristics available at the time of enrollment derived from 
crystalloid administration in the study ICUs in the year prior to the trial, and ( 3) 
comparing outcomes between study groups among a “modified intention -to-treat” 
population of patients who received at least 500 mL of any study crystalloid in the 72 
hours after enrollment.  
 
Additional Secondary Analyses  
We will perform the following additional  secondary analyses:  
(1) Comparison of secondary outcomes between study groups.  
(2) Effect modification by [CONTACT_763237] -specified subgroups.   Using 
generalized linear mixed effects modeling , we will examine the interaction 
between crystalloid assignment and the following baseline variables with respect 
to the primary outcome of MAKE30 in th e intention -to-treat population :  
15 
 a. Source of admission to the ICU  (Emergency department, Operating room,  
Transfer from another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494], Other) 
b. Study ICU (Medical, Surgical, Cardiac, Neurological, Trauma) .  [Because 
cluster cannot be treated as a random effect for this  subgroup , we will u se 
logistic regression modeling]  
c. Sepsis or septic shock (Yes, No)  
d. Traumatic brain injury (Yes, No)  
e. Receipt of mechanical ventilation  (Yes, No)  
f. Receipt of vasopressors  (Yes, No)  
g. Category of renal dysfunction at the time of enrollment ( No renal dysfunction , 
Acute kidney injury , Chronic kidney disease , End-stage r enal disease 
receiving RRT)  
h. Risk of  in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763176] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]  (continuous variable  
ranging 0.0 to 1.0 ) 
(3) Sensitivity analysi s excluding patients admitted in the week p rior to a crossover  
(‘washout’) .  We will repeat the primary analysis comparing MAKE30 between 
study groups in the intention to treat population excluding those admitted in the 7 
days prior to a crossover in ICU crystalloid assignment (simulating a “washout” 
period).  Prior data from the study ICUs suggests that less than 10% of patients 
remain in the ICU for longer than 7 days [14].  Excluding those admitted within 7 
days of a crossover in ICU crystalloid assignment will allow u se of a baseline 
factor to exclude the majority of  patients who w ould go on to experience a 
crossover in crystalloid assignment due to the study design.   
(4) Sensitivity analysis excluding patients who were transferred between ICUs or  
remained in the ICU through  a crossover (‘per protocol’).   We will repeat the 
primary analysis comparing MAKE30 between study groups in the intention to 
treat population excluding those who remain ed in the intensive care unit through 
a crossover in crystalloid assignment  or were transferred between study ICUs . 
(5) Sensitivity analysis including only each patient’s first admission to a participating 
intensive care unit during the study period.  We will repeat the primary analysis 
[ADDRESS_1045792] ICU admission in the study for each patient.  
 
Corrections for multiple testing  
 All of the additional secondary analyses will be considered hypothesis -generating 
and no corrections for multiple comparisons will be performed.   
 
Handling of Missing Data  
 Of the components of the MAKE30 primary outcome, data regarding in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763177] [14,22] .  In contrast, the persistent renal dysfunction component of 
MAKE3 0 may suffer from missing data for serum creatinine value  at baseline or 
between enrollment and  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] .  In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 974 patients in the same 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , 31 patients (3.2%) had no measured  serum creatinine between enrollment and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] [14].  Of these 31 patients, 6 (19.4%) died within hours of ICU 
admission and qualified for the MAKE30 outcome via the in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763157].  
The remainin g 25 (80.6%) were low acuity ICU patients with a normal creatinine value 
measured in the [ADDRESS_1045793] to missing data for baseline serum creatinine, in the same pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] 
595 of 974 patients (61.0%) had a measured serum creatinine value between 12 
months and 24 ho urs prior to hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_063] [14].  Of those without such a 
measurement, 259 of 379 (68.3%) had a value measured between  24 hours prior to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763158].  Only 120 of 974 patients (12.3%) did not have 
an availa ble serum creatinine value prior to enrollment.  For the main analysis, p atients 
without a measured serum creatinine value between [ADDRESS_1045794] a baseline creatinine value estimated using a 
previously -descr ibed three -variable formula [29].  Multiple alternative approaches to 
missing baseline creatinine data will be  explored in sensitivity analyses including use of 
complete cases, multivariable single imputation, and use of the first creatinine after 
enrollment or the highest or lowest creatinine during the study  (see Appendix 5 ). 
 
Post hoc analyses.   
In the event t hat investigators or reviewers introduce analyses in addition to 
those described above, these will be clearly delimitated as post hoc  and will be 
considered hypothesis -generating.  
 
PRESENTATION OF THE RESULTS  
 After completion of enrollment and data analysis, the results of the trial will be 
communicated to the public through manuscript publication and submission of the 
results to clinicaltrials.gov .  Submission for publication will include public access to the 
full study protocol and statistical code.  Authorship will be based on the International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines and professional writers will not be 
used.  
The flow of patients through the study will be presented in a flow diagram  (Figure 
2).  Baseline characteristics will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] , as shown in Table 1  
and Table E2 .  The volume of isotonic crystalloid administered , other fluids, and blood 
products administered  over time will b e presented by [CONTACT_1570] (Tab le E3).  
Serum values for sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, and 
creatinine will be presented in figures displaying serum values over time by [CONTACT_763245] ( Table E 4).  Clinical and renal 
outcomes will be reported by [CONTACT_1570], as shown in Table 2.   For the primary 
analysis of the primary outcome, we will present the unadjusted frequency and 
proportion of MAKE30 in each study group as well as the adjusted odds ratio, 95% 
confidence interval, and P value derived from the generalized linear mixed -effects 
model.  Indications for new renal replacement therapy will be displayed as in Table E 5.  
Heterogeneity of treatment effect analyses will be displayed as loess curves or partial  
[ADDRESS_1045795] acutely ill patients.   Better clinical outcomes with saline 
would cement 0.9% sodium chloride as the first line  isotonic intrav enous fluid and end 
the current debate about optimal crystalloid composition.  In this comparative 
effectiveness trial of thousands  of critically ill adults, a finding of no difference between  
groups would still have important implications for clinical car e and future research.  In a 
trial powered to detect absolute risk reductions as small as 2% in clinical outcomes, no 
difference between groups would imply that the effect of crystalloid choice for the 
majority of ICU patients is minimal and any future res earch would need to focus on 
select subpopulations.  
While designing SMART, we weighed the relative advantages and disadvantages 
of multiple study designs, including a blinded, patient -level randomized trial.  A major 
challenge to controlled studies of flui d administration in critical illness is the ability to 
enroll patients prior to the period of highest fluid exposure.  As the majority of fluid is 
administered as  part of resuscitation in the emergency department and first [ADDRESS_1045796] readily available in the study unit .  The enrollment of 
all adults admitted to the participating ICUs examines the effects of saline v ersus  
balanced crystalloids in a real -world, clinical environment improving the generalizability 
of the study fin dings.  Coupling group assignment at the level of the ICU with relatively 
short periods (one month) and frequent crossovers (at least eleven in each unit) 
balances baseline characteristics and co -interventions better than a simple cluster -
randomized trial or before -after trial with the same number of units , decreasing 
confounding by [CONTACT_763246].   Although blinding of 
treating clinicians and study personnel to the assigned intervention would be ideal, a 
prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_763178], perhaps due to the over t effect of the study crystalloids on 
clinically available laboratory values such as serum chloride and bicarbonate [13].  Use 
of an objective, patient -centered primary outcome abstracted automatically from the 
EHR  increases the pragmatic nature of the design and diminishes the risk of observ er 
bias. 
Several p otential threats to the validity of our trial  exist.  Including all patients 
admitte d to each study ICU may produce  a patient population with limited average 
exposure to the study interventions [13,14] .  Based on our preliminary data from the 
same units prior to this study, however, we anticipate that more than 90% of enrolled 
patients will receive isotonic crystalloid and at least 25% of  patients will receive more 
than 4 liters of isotonic crystalloid, which is comparable or greater than that received in 
prior positive ICU fluid trials [30].  Additionally, we have pre -specified analyses to 
evaluate for a ‘dose -response’ relationship between the volume o f isotonic crystalloid 
administered  and clinical outcomes with saline vs balanced crystalloid.   Similarly, the 
broad enrollment criteria may produce a study population at relatively low risk for 
adverse clinical outcomes.  The anticipated incidence of the primary outcome of 15%, 
however, is comparable to that of other large ICU fluid management trials [30,31] .  
Treating clinicians are aware of study group assignment which may permit  a treatment 
bias in which clinicians admini ster less isotonic crystalloid and/or more non -isotonic 
crystalloids when assigned to one  of the fluid groups.  For this reason, we will record 
[ADDRESS_1045797] of intra -cluster correlation to be minimized by [CONTACT_763247] -period correlation  and intra-cluster intra -
period correlation to be small.  Our primary analysis uses a generalized linear mixed -
effects model  to account for these aspects of the study structure.  In the absence of a  
washout per iod, there will be carryover of crystalloid administration from one group 
assignment into the other, but based on  pi[INVESTIGATOR_763179] -
assigned crystalloid received as a result of carryover will be low [14], and we pre -specify 
secondary analyses to address the effects of carryover.   Finally, although MAKE30 is a 
recommended outcome for clinical trials involving AKI [23,32] , use of a composite 
outcome presents potential challenges.   Unlike death and new receipt of renal 
replacement therapy, whether persistent renal dysfunction on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174157] a 
patient -centered outcome remains a point of discussion.   Persistent renal dysf unction 
also relies on the availability of serum creatinine measurements at baseline and before 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] – potentially requiring  imputation of missing data for one component  
of the composite primary outcome.  Perhaps most importantly, although de ath, new 
receipt of renal replacement therapy, and persistent renal dysfunction are weighted 
equally in the MAKE30 composite outcome, they a may not represent equivalent 
outcomes to patients or providers.   To address this we will provide data on the MAKE30  
outcome overall and each of its separate components.

 Appendix 2: Denifitions of Study Variables  
 
Fluids  
Intravenous fluid  – For the SMART study, intravenous fluid will be defined as the 
intravenous administration of any formulation of any volume at any rate of 0.9% sodium 
chloride, Lactated Ringer’s, Plasma -Lyte A®; 0.45% sodium chloride, 0.225% sodium 
chloride, dextrose in water, 20% or 5% human albumin solution, gelatins, dextrans, or 
hydroxyethyl starches.  This will include fluid given as a bolus, fluid given as 
maintenance infusions, fluid given as flushes, fluid given as ‘pi[INVESTIGATOR_74723] -back’ infusions for IV 
medications, fluid given through pressure -bag systems, fluid given as a part of 
thermodilution of pulmonary artery catheters, and fluid given to maintain the patency of 
peripheral venous access.  This will not include carrier fluid for medications and oral 
fluids.  
 
Isotonic crystalloid – For the SMART study, the term isotonic crystalloid will be used 
to refer to any of 0.9% sodium chloride, Lactated Ringer’s, or Plasma -Lyte A®.  Use of 
the term isotonic crystalloid is intended to distinguish these three fluids from colloid 
solutions and from significantly hypotonic (0.45% sodium chloride) or hypertonic (3% 
sodium chloride) crystalloid solutions, rather than to imply that the tonicities of 0.9% 
sodium chloride, Lactated Ringer’s, or Plasma -Lyte A® are precisely comparable to 
extracellular fluid.  
 
Saline  – Saline will refer to 0.9% sodium chloride.  
 
Balanced Crystalloid  – For the SMART study, Lactated Ringer’s or Plasma -Lyte A® 
will be referred to as balanced crystalloids.  
 
 
Renal Function  
Baseline serum creatinine  – The value fo r baseline serum creatinine will be 
determined in a hierarchical approach. The lowest serum creatinine between [ADDRESS_1045800] creatinine value  between 24 h prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763185].  If no creatinine value is available between 
12 months prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763170], a baseline 
creatinine value will be estimated using a pr eviously -described three -variable formula 
[creatinine = 0.74 − 0.2 (if female) + 0.08 (if African American) + 0.003 × age (in 
years)] [25]. 
 
Acute kidney injury, stage II or greater  – Stage II or greater acute kidney injury will be 
defined according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine 
criteria [26] as a creatinine value between enrollment and the first of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449007] [ADDRESS_1045801] 200% of the baseline value OR both (1) greater than 4.0 mg/dL and 
(2) increased at least 0.3 mg/dL from baseline.  Patients may have acute kidney injury 
present at the time of first creatinine measurement after enrollment (prevalent AKI) or 
acute kidney  injury developi[INVESTIGATOR_763186] (incident AKI).  Incident AKI will be 
defined as any creatinine value between enrollment and discharge or 30 days that is (1) 
increased at least 0.3 mg/dL from a preceding post -enrollment value AND (2) at least 
200% of t he baseline value, at least 200% of a preceding post -enrollment value, or at 
least 4.0 mg/dL.  
 
Chronic kidney disease stage III or greater  – Chronic kidney disease stage III or 
greater will be defined as a glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 as 
calculated by [CONTACT_345276][INVESTIGATOR_623] (CKD -EPI) Collaboration 
equation [33] using the patient’s baseline creatinine value.  
 
 
Outcomes  
Major Adverse Kidney Events within 30 days (MAKE30).   The MAKE30 composite 
outcome will be considered to have occurred when patients meet one or more of the 
following criteria in the 30 days after enrollment: (1) in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], (2) receipt of 
new renal replacement therapy (RRT), or (3) persistent re nal dysfunction.  Patients who 
[ADDRESS_1045802] received RRT prior to enrollment will be ineligible to meet the new RRT or 
persistent renal dysfunction criteria but will remain eligible to meet criteria for in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77087].  
 
In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380] – In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] m ortality will be defined as death from any cause 
prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763187] 30 days after ICU admission (30 -day in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77087]).  
 
Receipt of new renal replacement therapy – Receipt of new RRT will be defined as 
receipt of any modality o f RRT between ICU admission and the first of (1) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_456902] (2) [ADDRESS_1045803] received RRT prior to ICU 
admission.  
 
Persistent renal dysfunction  – Persistent renal dysfunction will be defined as a final 
serum creatinine  value before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (censored at 30 days after enrollment) 
that is ≥  
200% of the baseline creatinine value.  
 
ICU-free days – Intensive care unit -free days to day 28 (ICU -free days) will be defined 
as the number of days from the time of the pat ient’s physical transfer out of the ICU until 
day 28 after enrollment.  Patients who die prior to day 28 after enrollment will receive a 
value of 0 for ICU -free days.  Patients who are never transferred out of the ICU prior to 
day 28 after enrollment will receive a value of 0 for ICU -free days.  Patients who are 
transferred out of the ICU, return to the ICU, and are not subsequently transferred out of 
the ICU again before day 28 after enrollment will receive a value of 0 for ICU -free days.  
For patients who  are transferred out of the ICU, are readmitted to the ICU, and are 
subsequently transferred out of the ICU again prior to day 28 after enrollment, ICU -free 
days will be awarded based on the time of the final transfer out of the ICU prior to day 
28 after e nrollment.  
 
Ventilator -free days – Ventilator -free days to day 28 (VFDs) will be defined as the 
41 
 number of days from the time of initiating unassisted breathing until day 28 after 
enrollment.  Patients who die prior to day 28 after enrollment will receive a  value of 0 for 
VFDs.  Patients who never achieve unassisted breathing prior to day 28 after enrollment 
will receive a value of 0 for VFDs.  Patients who achieve unassisted breathing, return to 
assisted breathing, and do not again achieve unassisted breath ing before day 28 after 
enrollment will receive a value of 0 for VFDs.  For patients who achieve unassisted 
breathing, return to assisted breathing, and subsequently achieve unassisted breathing 
again prior to day 28 after enrollment, VFDs will be awarded based on the time of the 
final initiation of unassisted breathing prior to day 28 after enrollment.  Survivors who 
never experience assisted breathing will receive 28 VFDs.  
 
Vasopressor -free days – Vasopressor -free days to day 28 will be defined as the 
number of days from the time of vasopressor cessation until day 28 after enrollment.  
Patients who die prior to day 28 after enrollment will receive a value of 0 for 
vasopressor -free days.  Patients who never cease to receive vasopressors prior to day 
28 afte r enrollment will receive a value of 0 for vasopressor -free days.  Patients who 
achieve vasopressor cessation, return to receiving vasopressors, and do not again 
achieve vasopressor cessation before day 28 after enrollment will receive a value of 0 
for vas opressor -free days.  For patients who achieve vasopressor cessation, return to 
receiving vasopressors, and subsequently achieve cessation of vasopressors again 
prior to day 28 after enrollment, vasopressor -free days will be awarded based on the 
time of the  final cessation of vasopressors prior to day 28 after enrollment.  Survivors 
who never receive vasopressors will receive 28 vasopressor -free days.  
 
Renal replacement therapy -free days – Renal replacement therapy -free days to day 
28 (RRT -free days) will be  defined as the number of days from the time the final RRT 
treatment until day 28 after enrollment.  Patients who die prior to day 28 after enrollment 
will receive a value of 0 for RRT -free days.  Patients who continue to receive RRT 
through day 28 after e nrollment will receive a value of 0 for RRT -free days.  Patients 
who achieve RRT cessation, return to receiving RRT, and do not again achieve RRT 
cessation before day 28 after enrollment will receive a value of 0 for RRT -free days.  
42 
 For patients who achiev e RRT cessation, return to receiving RRT, and subsequently 
achieve cessation of RRT again prior to day 28 after enrollment, RRT -free days will be 
awarded based on the time of the final RRT treatment prior to day 28 after enrollment.  
Survivors who never re ceive RRT will receive 28 RRT -free days.

 Appendix 3: Sample Size Estimation and Re -estimation  
 
Initial Sample Size  Justification  (Initial Protocol)  
 In clinical practice, the use of balanced intravenous fluids instead of chloride -rich 
fluids is an intervention with no increased cost and both types of fluids are equally 
available to the practitioner.  Therefore any difference between treatment groups is 
clinically meaningful in regards to the MAKE30 primary endpoint.  In previous studies 
using the MAKE30 composite endpoi nt in critically ill patients, the development of this 
endpoint occurred at a rate of 22%.  SMART -MED is anticipated to enroll between 
3,000 and 3,600 patients over the one year study period.  Barring logistical difficulties, 
SMART -SURG is anticipated to e nroll between 5,000 and 6,500 patients over the one 
year study period.  Enrollment of 8,000 patients in the SMART study overall would allow 
detection of a difference of 2.6% in the incidence of the primary endpoint with 80% 
power using a type I error of 0. 05. 
 
Revised Sample Size Justification (Protocol Revision 5/10/16)  
 The initial protocol called for a study duration of 12 months in 5 units (60 unit -
months) based on an anticipated MAKE30 event rate of 22.0%.  This event rate was 
based on prior observatio nal data [24], but was no t specific to the study institution.   
We have subsequently conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_763188] a 
small amount of observational data regarding the incidence of MAKE30 in the non -
medical ICUs.  These data suggest (1) variation in the rate  of MAKE30 between ICUs 
and (2) an overall rate of MAKE30 in the range of 15 -17%, lower than anticipated in our 
initial power calculation.  In order to retain adequate power to detect a relative risk 
reduction in the initially specified range, we plan to i ncrease the duration of the study to 
include a total of 82 unit -months over a  calendar period of two years.  
Based on data fro m the year prior we anticipate the total enrollment in 
SMART to be around 14,000 and the overall rate of MAKE30 to be around 15%, 
resulting in a detectible absolute risk reduction of 1.9% or relative risk reduction 
of 12%.  The largest prior trial of salin e versus balanced crystalloids reported a point 
estimate for the relative risk reduction in favor of balanced crystalloids of 12% [13].  
44 
 Appendix 4: Interim Analyses   
 
Interim Analysis (Initial Protocol)  
Enrollment will occur over an expected one year period in which all Vanderbilt 
ICUs are randomly assigned to one month blocks of alternating balanced fluids only or 
0.9% saline only.  Blocks will be only one month in length to minimize the effect of 
seasonal variability.   
 Thirty days after the conclusion of the sixth month of the stu dy, the DSMB will 
review one interim analysis to determine if further study is warranted.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_763149] (1) the difference in the incidence of the primary 
outcome (MAKE30) between groups is greater than or equal to 2.6%  with a p value less 
than 0.001 AND (2) the p value is less than 0.001 for either death or new renal 
replacement therapy.  As even small differences between groups would be clinically 
meaningful and given the importance to determine with as much certainty as possible 
whether balanced fluids are superior to chloride -rich fluids, there will not be a futility 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106].   
 
Interim Analyses (Protocol Revision 5/10/16)  
 With the initial trial duration scheduled for 12 months in 5 ICUs (60 ICU -months), 
we planned for a single interim analysis by [CONTACT_4318] [ADDRESS_1045804] interim analysis.  Specifically, the stoppin g boundary 
for efficacy will be met if (1) the difference in the incidence of the primary outcome 
(MAKE30) between groups is greater than or equal to 2.6% with a p value less than 
0.001 AND (2) the p value is less than 0.001 for either death or new renal r eplacement 
therapy.  As even small differences between groups would be clinically meaningful and 
given the importance to determine with as much certainty as possible whether balanced 
fluids are superior to chloride -rich fluids, there will not be a futility  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106].

 Appendix 5: Handling of Missing Baseline Serum Creatinine Values  
 
For patients without a measured serum creatinine between 12 months prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763189], baseline creatinine value for the primary analysis will b e 
estimated using a previously -described three -variable formula [creatinine = 0.74 − 0.2 (if 
female) + 0.08 (if African American) + 0.003 × age (in years)] [25].  Multiple sensitivity 
analyses will employ alternative approaches to estimating missing baseline creatinine 
values:  
1) A ‘complete cases’ analysis will be performed in which patients without a 
measured creatinine value between 12 months prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763190].   
2) Missing baseline serum creatinine values will be imputed by [CONTACT_763251] s ingle 
imputation using the R function aregImpute in Hmisc package with 5 imputations. 
The imputation model will include age, gender, race, group assignment, source 
of admission, primary diagnosis, receipt of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor 
receipt, pri or hemodialysis, total fluids received in 30 days, UHC expected 
mortality, overall mortality, new RRT received, minimum creatinine value, 
maximum creatinine value, and final study creatinine value.  Continuous 
variables will be transformed via cubic spline s with 3 to 5 knots.  
3) Simple imputation will be performed in which first serum creatinine value after 
enrollment is used as the baseline creatinine.  
4) Simple imputation will be performed in which the highest serum creatinine value 
between enrollment and 30 da ys is used as the baseline creatinine.  
5) Simple imputation will be performed in which the lowest serum creatinine value 
between enrollment and [ADDRESS_1045805] hoc .  This Statistical Analysis Plan was:

Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) Investigators and the Pragmatic Critical Care Research Group
Abstract
Background: Saline, the intravenous fluid most commonly administered to critically ill adults, contains a high chloride
content, which may be associated with acute kidney injury and death. Whether using balanced crystalloids rather than
saline decreases the risk of acute kidney injury and death among critically ill adults remains unknown.
Methods: The Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) is a pragmatic, cluster-level allocation,
cluster-level crossover trial being conducted between 1 June 2015 and 30 April 2017 in five intensive care units
at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, TN, [LOCATION_003]. SMART compares saline (0.9% sodium chloride)
with balanced crystalloids (clinician ’s choice of lactated Ringer ’s solution or Plasma-Lyte A®). Each intensive care unit is
assigned to provide either saline or balanced crystalloids each month, with the assigned crystalloid alternating monthly
over the course of the trial. All adults admitted to participating intensive care units during the study period are enrolled
and followed until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 30 days after enrollment. The anticipated enrollment is approximately 14,000
patients. The primary outcome is Major Adverse Kidney Events within 30 days —the composite of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763191], receipt of new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (discharge creatinine ≥200%
of baseline creatinine). Secondary clinical outcomes include in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], intensive care unit-free days,
ventilator-free days, vasopressor-free days, and renal re placement therapy-free days. Secondary renal outcomes
include new renal replacement therapy receipt, persistent renal dysfunction, and incidence of stage 2 or higher acute
kidney injury.
Discussion: This ongoing pragmatic trial will provide the largest and most comprehensive comparison to date of
clinical outcomes with saline versus balanced crystalloids among critically ill adults.
Trial registration: For logistical reasons, SMART was prospectively registered separately for the medical ICU (SMART-
MED; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; registered on 11 May 2015; date of first patient enrollment: 1 June 2015)
and the nonmedical ICUs (SMART-SURG; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; registered on 9 September 2015;
date of first patient enrollment: 1 October 2015).

Background
The administration of intravenous (IV) fluid is ubi-
quitous in the care of the critically ill [1]. Globally,
0.9% sodium chloride (saline) is the most common
resuscitation fluid, but recent data have associated
saline with hyperchloremia [2, 3], metabolic acidosis
and renal vasoconstriction [4, 5], acute kidney injury
(AKI) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) [6], and
increased mortality [7, 8]. Although several observa-
tional studies [7, 9 –11], a before-and-after trial [6],
and meta-analyses [8, 12] suggested increased rates
of AKI, RRT receipt, and death with saline compared
with balanced crystalloids, researchers in two recent
randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_4250] f ound no difference between
crystalloids in any patient outcome [13, 14]. The
number of patients enrolled in these pi[INVESTIGATOR_763192]. Thus, the optimal
choice of isotonic crystalloid for the treatment of
critically ill adults remains unknown [15, 16]. To
determine the impact of balanced crystalloids com-
pared with saline on clinical outcomes among critic-
ally ill adults, a large, prospective, controlled trial is
needed [13, 17].
The aim of the present trial is to compare the effect
of balanced crystalloids with that of saline on the
development of major adverse kidney events (the
composite of death, new RRT, or persistent renal dys-
function) among intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
Secondary aims are to evaluate the effect of balanced
crystalloids with that of saline on laboratory values
(serum chloride, serum bicarbonate, serum creatinine),
organ injury (AKI, receipt of RRT), and additional
clinical outcomes (ventilator-free days, ICU-free days,
in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]). We hypothesize that use of
balanced crystalloids among ICU patients will reduce
the incidence of major adverse kidney events.

and study procedures are embedded into routine care
and executed by [CONTACT_261571]. The trial was
approved by [CONTACT_763252] (IRB) with waiver of
informed consent (IRB 141349). The trial was regis-
tered with ClinicalTrials.gov prior to initiation of patient
enrollment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02 444988,
NCT0 2547779). An independent data and safety monitor-
ing board (DSMB) is monitoring the progress and safety of
the trial. The trial is investigator-initiated with funding
provided by [CONTACT_763253]-
lational Research through a Clinical and Translational
Science Award from the National Center for Advancing
Translational Sciences (UL1 TR000445).
Study sites and period
SMART is being conducted in five academic ICUs at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center: a 34-bed medical
ICU, a 22-bed neurological and neurosurgical ICU, a 27-
bed cardiovascular ICU, a 31-bed trauma ICU, and a 22-
bed surgical ICU. Participating ICUs began enrollment
sequentially over the first year of the study (Fig. 2). Each
ICU will enroll patients for at least 12 months and will
enroll participants for an equal number of saline and
balanced crystalloid months.
Population
All adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to a participating
ICU at Vanderbilt University Medical Center during the
study period are enrolled at the time of ICU admission.
Enrolled patients who are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763194] a participating
ICU again during the study period.
Consent
Saline, lactated Ringer ’s solution, and Plasma-Lyte A® are
all IV crystalloids currently used in the routine care of
patients admitted to the ICUs at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center. Currently, no high-quality data suggest
that choice of crystalloid affects clinical outcomes
among critically ill adults. During the SMART trial, each
time a study crystalloid is ordered, the study confirms
that the treating clinician does not feel that a spe-
cific study crystalloid is required for the safe treatment
of that specific patient at that specific point in time (seeSemler et al. Trials  (2017) 18:129 Page 2 of 13
Study interventions section below). The trial is felt to pose
minimal risk because (1) expos ure to the study crystalloids
occurs only for patients whose treating clinician has already
decided to administer an IV crystalloid, (2) all of the crystal-
loid solutions examined are already used in routine practice
in the study environment, (3) no definitive prior data
suggest clinical outcomes are better with one crystalloid
relative to the others, and (4) the study confirms with every
crystalloid order that the treating clinician does not feel any
one crystalloid type is required for safe treatment of the
patient. Given the minimal risk, the focus of the study on
crystalloid use at an ICU level, as well as the impracticabil-
ity of consenting each patient admitted to each ICU prior
to the first administration of crystalloid, a waiver of
informed consent was granted by [CONTACT_763254] (IRB 141349).
Randomization and allocation
During each month of the study, each ICU is assigned to
either saline or balanced crystalloids. So that each ICU
would experience an equal number of months assigned
to saline and balanced crystalloids while minimizing
monthly imbalances in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ’s overall use of eachcrystalloid, we generated two sequences of study group
assignment: (1) saline during odd-numbered months
and balanced crystalloid during even-numbered months
or (2) balanced crystalloid during odd-numbered months
and saline during even-numbered months. We planned
for three ICUs to be assigned to one sequence and the
remaining two ICUs to the opposite sequence. To facili-
tate the early administration of the assigned crystalloid
in the ED and operating room prior to the patient ’s
physical arrival in the ICU, a single, computer-generated,
simple randomization was performed in which the three
ICUs that admit the majority of patients from the ED
(medical ICU, trauma ICU, and surgical ICU) were ran-
domized en bloc to one sequence of crystalloid group
assignments, and the two ICUs that admit the majority
of patients from the operating room (neurological ICU
and cardiac ICU) were randomized en bloc to the
opposite sequence of crystalloid group assignments
(Figs. 2 and 3).

Study interventions
Study protocol determines only the choice of IV isotonic
crystalloid: 0.9% sodium chloride (saline group) versus the
treating clinician ’s preference of lactated Ringer ’ss o l u t i o n
or Plasma-Lyte A® (balanced crystalloid group). The com-
position of each crystalloid solution is displayed in Add-
itional file 2: Table S1. Lactated Ringer ’ss o l u t i o na n d
Plasma-Lyte A® are the balanced crystalloids commonly
available in the [LOCATION_002] [21]. Lactated Ringer ’ss o l u -
tion and Plasma-Lyte A® both offer a significantly lower
chloride content than saline, but other minor differences
in composition lead some clinicians to prefer one bal-
anced crystalloid or the other for particular patients;
for example, some clinicians prefer Plasma-Lyte A® over
lactated Ringer ’s solution for patients receiving blood
transfusions [22]. Allowing clinicians to select either
lactated Ringer ’s solution or Plasma-Lyte A® when a
balanced crystalloid is assigned is anticipated to im-
prove compliance with balanced crystalloid assignment
and emulate how balanced crystalloids are used in prac-
tice while maintaining relevant comparator groups con-
sisting of crystalloid with a higher chloride content
(saline) versus crystalloids with a lower chloride con-
tent (lactated Ringer ’s solution and Plasma-Lyte A®).
Decisions regarding crystalloid rate, volume, and addi-
tive content are deferred to treating clinicians.
Delivery of the assigned crystalloid to patients occurs
via interventions in pharmacy supply and clinician order
entry. Each month, the dispensing cabinets within the
ICUs are stocked with 1000-ml bags of the assignedcrystalloid. Additionally, any order for IV crystalloid for
a patient located in a study ICU triggers an advisor
application within the electronic order entry system. The
advisor application informs providers about the study,
asks about relative contraindications to the assigned
crystalloid, and (if relative contraindications are not
present) guides providers to order the assigned crystal-
loid. Accepted relative contraindications for patients
assigned to balanced crystalloid include hyperkalemia
and brain injury. The severity of hyperkalemia and brain
injury at which saline will be used in favor of balanced
crystalloids is determined by [CONTACT_68071]. The
nonassigned crystalloid is also made available via the
pharmacy if a formal statement is submitted that the
attending physician feels the nonassigned crystalloid is
required for the safe treatment of a specific patient.
Although the study is focused on crystalloid use in the
ICU, crystalloid admi nistration prior to ICU admission in
the emergency department (ED) or operating room may
introduce contamination and limit separation between
study arms. Therefore, between 1 January 2016 and 30
April 2017, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center ED is
coordinating their crystalloid use with the medical, surgical,
and trauma ICUs such that patients admitted to those units
from the ED begin receiving the assigned crystalloid during
evaluation and management in the ED (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Clinical outcomes of patients
treated with study crystalloids in the ED and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763196].
Similarly, to the extent that it is logistically feasible, for
patients identified in the operating room as coming from
or being admitted to one of the participating ICUs, the
request is made that they receive the fluid assigned to the
corresponding ICU during th eir operative procedure.
Fluid administered prior to enrollment by [CONTACT_763255]-
gency medical system and outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], as well as
fluid administered after discharge from the ICU, is not
controlled by [CONTACT_1758].Fig. 2 Crystalloid assignment during the trial. During each month of the study, each intensive care unit is assigned to use either 0.9% saline (S) or
balanced crystalloids (B)Semler et al. Trials  (2017) 18:129 Page 4 of 13
Each day patients receive the crystalloid to which
their ICU is currently assigned. The necessity that an
IV crystalloid be clinically available at all times pre-
cluded the use of washout periods, and patients who
remain in the ICU through a crossover (i.e., from one
calendar month to another) may potentially be ex-
posed to both types of crystalloid. Although this in-
troduces the potential for contamination of study
groups, in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_763167], the
total volume of nonassigned crystalloid administered
because of the lack of a washout period was <125 ml
per patient [14]. As described in the Statistical ana-
lysis section below, patients will be analyzed in the
group to which they were assigned at the time of
study enrollment in an intention-to-treat fashion. For
example, a patient admitted to an ICU during a month
assigned to saline will be analyzed in the saline group even
if that patient remains in the ICU after the ICU switches
assignment to balanced crystalloids.Data collection
In this pragmatic trial, we are using data collected in
routine clinical care and electronically extracted from
the electronic health record (EHR) (see Additional
file 2). All data are stored confidentially in an institu-
tional patient data management system. Data collected
include prestudy renal functi on; demographic character-
istics, admitting location and diagnosis, and severity of
illness at enrollment; receipt of IV crystalloids, other
fluids, and blood products; serum electrolyte and cre-
atinine values; receipt of RRT, mechanical ventilation,
and vasopressors; and vital status and serum creatinine
at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Electronic extraction of these data
from the EHR has previously been validated against the
reference standard of two-physician manual chart
review [23]. For all patients who receive new RRT, study
personnel will perform manual chart review to confirm
the absence of prior RRT and identify the indication for
RRT.Fig. 3 Flow diagram of progress of patients through the trial. ICUIntensive care unitSemler et al. Trials  (2017) 18:129 Page 5 of 13
Primary outcome
The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients
meeting one or more criteria for MAKE30: in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763197], receipt of new RRT, or persistent renal dysfunc-
tion defined as a final inpatient serum creatinine value
≥200% of baseline [23 –25]. In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763198]-
charge censored at [ADDRESS_1045808] re-
ceived RRT prior to ICU admission. Persistent renal
dysfunction will be defined as a final serum creatinine
value before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (censored at 30 days after
enrollment) ≥200% of the baseline creatinine value. The
value for baseline serum creatinine will be determined
using a previously described hierarchical approach [23].
The lowest serum creatinine between [ADDRESS_1045809] creatinine
value between 24 h prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763199]. If no creatinine value
is available between 12 months prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763200], a baseline creatinine value
will be estimated using a previously described formula
[creatinine = 0.74 −0.2 (if female) + 0.08 (if African Ameri-
can) + 0.003 × age (in years)] [26]. Patients known to have
received RRT prior to enrollment will be considered ineli-
gible to meet criteria for new RRT or persistent renal dys-
function, but they may qualify for MAKE30 by
[CONTACT_763256]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380].
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes will include additional clinical out-
comes, additional renal out comes, and biochemical out-
comes. Additional clinical outcomes will include in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763201], before 30 days, and before
60 days, as well as ICU-free days, ventilator-free days,
vasopressor-free days, and RRT-free days, all through
28 days after enrollment. Additional renal outcomes will in-
clude new RRT receipt, persistent renal dysfunction, stage 2
or higher AKI according to Kidney Disease: Improving
Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria [27], highest
serum creatinine value, chang e from baseline creatinine to
highest creatinine, final serum creatinine value before
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and duration of new RRT. Biochemical
outcomes will include serum va lues for sodium, potassium,
chloride, bicarbonate, blood ur ea nitrogen, and creatinine
from enrollment through day 30.
Power calculation
On the basis of data from the study ICUs in the 1 year
prior to the trial, we anticipate the planned studyduration (Fig. 2) will result in enrollment of around
14,000 patients with an overall rate of MAKE30 around
15%. Enrollment of 14,000 patients will provide 90%
power at an αlevel of 0.[ADDRESS_1045810] an absolute differ-
ence between the saline and balanced crystalloid groups
in MAKE30 of 1.9%, as well as a relative risk reduction
of 12%, which is comparable to the 12% relative risk re-
duction for in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763171] a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_763202] [13] (additional details in Additional file 2).
Data and safety monitoring board and interim analysis
A DSMB was appointed to oversee the conduct of the
trial and review two interim analyses. The DSMB is
comprised of two academic intensivists outside the study
institution who are experienced in the conduct of
clinical trials in critical illness. The first interim analysis
occurred [ADDRESS_1045811] interim analysis and the end of the trial,
examining patients enrolled between 1 June 2015 and 31
July 2016 (additional details in Additional file 2). Both
interim analyses used the same stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]:
The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_763172] (1)
the unadjusted difference in the incidence of the
primary outcome (MAKE30) between study groups is
greater than or equal to 2.6% with a P value less than
0.001 and (2) the P value is less than 0.001 for the
difference between study groups in the incidence of
either in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763203].
Because even small differences between groups would
be clinically meaningful, and given the importance of
determining with as much certainty as possible
whether balanced crystalloids are superior to saline, a
futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_763204]. Use of
the conservative Haybittle-Peto boundary (P < 0.001)
will allow the final analysis to be performed using an
unchanged level of significance (P = 0.05).
At the time of submission of the manuscript of this
report, both interim analyses had been completed, and
the DSMB had recommended continuing the trial to
completion. In addition, the DSMB is available to evalu-
ate adverse events or serious adverse events during the
conduct of the trial. In cases of serious adverse events,
the DSMB has the ability to pause the trial to investigate
possible safety issues and suggest changes to the design
of the study to abrogate any safety issues.
Statistical analysis principles
All analyses will be performed using R version 3.2.0
software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria). To maximize transparency andSemler et al. Trials  (2017) 18:129 Page 6 of 13
reproducibility, a complete version of the R code that
will be used to analyze the final study data is avail-
able in Additional file 3. This ensures that (1) statis-
tical reviewers or external in vestigators will be able to
replicate the prespecified analysis of the trial inde-
pendently and (2) any changes or additions to the
statistical analysis introduced by [CONTACT_763257]-
viewers after completion of enrollment will be evident
as differences between the prespecified code and the
analysis code included with the final publication.
All analyses will be conducted at the level of the indi-
vidual patient during an individual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763205]-to-treat fashion unless otherwise specified.
Continuous variables will be reported as mean ± SD,
mean and 95% CI, or median and IQR; categorical vari-
ables will be reported as frequencies and proportions.
Between-group comparisons will be made with the
Mann-Whitney rank-sum test for continuous variables,
the chi-square test for categorical variables, generalized
estimating equations for repeatedly measured variables,
and generalized linear mixed-effects models for analyses
of the primary and secondary outcomes. A two-sided P
value <0.05 will be considered statistically significant.
Analytic rationale
In the setting of a large, pragmatic trial enrolling every
adult admitted to the five participating ICUs, the
SMART study population will contain a wide spectrum
of (1) exposure to the study intervention, (2) baseline
risk of the primary outcome, and (3) physiologically dis-
tinct patient subgroups. The primary and secondary ana-
lyses evaluate the effect of the intervention overall and
across the spectrum of exposure to crystalloid, baseline
risk of MAKE30, and patient subgroups.
Primary analysis
To account for the cluster-level allocation, cluster-level
crossover structure of the trial, the primary analysis will
be an intention-to-treat comparison of the primary out-
come of MAKE30 between the saline and balanced crys-
talloid groups using a generalized linear mixed-effects
model including fixed effects (group assignment, age,
sex, race, source of admission, mechanical ventilation,
vasopressor receipt, diagnosis of sepsis, and diagnosis of
traumatic brain injury) and random effects (ICU)
(additional details in Additional file 2) [28, 29].
Main secondary analysis
Anticipating (1) a wide range in the total volume of crys-
talloid received by [CONTACT_763258] (2) the potential
for greater difference in outcomes between study groups
among those patients who receive larger volumes of crys-
talloid, the main secondary analysis will compare the pro-
portion of patients experiencing MAKE30 in the salineand balanced crystalloid groups, accounting for patients ’
overall volume of isotonic crystalloid received. For this
analysis, we will construct a logistic regression model with
MAKE30 as the outcome and independent variables of
study group, total isotonic crystalloid received between
enrollment and 30 days, and the interaction between the
two (as a cross-product term). This will allow us to deter-
mine whether any volume of crystalloid receipt exists at
which use of balanced crystalloids decreases the risk of
MAKE30 compared with saline.
Given that total crystalloid receipt is a variable that
emerges after enrollment, we will perform sensitivity
analyses (1) using total crystalloid receipt in the 72 h
after enrollment (before incident AKI or death are
likely to have affected isotonic crystalloid administra-
tion), (2) replacing the actual total crystalloid receipt
with predicted total crystalloid receipt based on a
multivariable linear regression model using patient
and ICU characteristics available at the time of en-
rollment derived from crystalloid administration in
the study ICUs in the 1 year prior to the trial, and
(3) comparing outcomes between study groups among
a modified intention-to-treat population of patients
who received at least 500 ml of any study crystalloid
in the 72 h after enrollment.
Additional secondary analyses
We will perform the following additional secondary
analyses:
1.Comparison of secondary outcomes between study
groups.
2.Effect modification by [CONTACT_763259]. Using generalized linear
mixed-effects modeling, we will examine the
interaction between crystalloid assignment and the
following baseline variables with respect to the
primary outcome of MAKE30 in the intention-to-
treat population:
a. Source of admission to the ICU (ED, operating
room, transfer from another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763206], other)
b. Study ICU (medical, surgical, cardiac, neurological,
trauma) (Because cluster cannot be treated as a
random effect for this subgroup, we will use logistic
regression modeling.)
c. Sepsis or septic shock (yes, no)
d. Traumatic brain injury (yes, no)
e. Receipt of mechanical ventilation (yes, no)
f. Receipt of vasopressors (yes, no)
g. Category of renal dysfunction at the time of
enrollment (no renal dysfunction, AKI, chronic
kidney disease, end-stage renal disease receiving RRT)Semler et al. Trials  (2017) 18:129 Page 7 of 13
h. Risk of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763207]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380] (continuous variable ranging
from 0.0 to 1.0)
3.Sensitivity analysis excluding patients admitted in
the week prior to a crossover ( “washout ”).We will
repeat the primary analysis comparing MAKE30
between study groups in the intention-to-treat
population excluding those admitted in the 7 days
prior to a crossover in ICU crystalloid assignment
(simulating a washout period). Prior data from the
study ICUs suggest that less than 10% of patients
remain in the ICU for longer than 7 days [ 14].
Excluding those admitted within 7 days of a crossover
in ICU crystalloid assignment will allow use of a
baseline factor to exclude the majority of patients who
would go on to experience a crossover in crystalloid
assignment because of the study design.
4.Sensitivity analysis excluding patients who were
transferred between ICUs or remained in the ICU
through a crossover ( “per protocol ”).We will repeat
the primary analysis comparing MAKE30 between
study groups in the intention-to-treat population
excluding those who remained in the ICU through
a crossover in crystalloid assignment or who were
transferred between study ICUs.
5.Sensitivity analysis including only each patient ’s first
admission to a participating ICU during the study
period. We will repeat the primary analysis
comparing MAKE30 between study groups in the
intention-to-treat population including only the first
ICU admission in the study for each patient.
Corrections for multiple testing
All of the additional secondary analyses will be considered
hypothesis-generating, and no corrections for multiple
comparisons will be performed.
Handling of missing data
Of the components of the MAKE30 primary outcome,
data regarding in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763208]
[14, 23]. In contrast, the persistent renal dysfunction
component of MAKE30 may suffer from missing data
for serum creatinine value at baseline or between enroll-
ment and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 974 pa-
tients in the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 31 patients (3.2%) had no
measured serum creatinine between enrollment and hos-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] [14]. Of these 31 patients, 6 (19.4%) died
within hours of ICU admission and qualified for the
MAKE30 outcome via the in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763157].
The remaining 25 (80.6%) were low-acuity ICU patients
with a normal creatinine value measured in the [ADDRESS_1045812] to missing data for baseline serum
creatinine, in the same pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 595 (61.0%) of 974
patients had a measured serum creatinine value between
12 months and 24 h prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] [14]. Of
those without such a measurement, 259 (68.3%) of 379
had a value measured between 24 h prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763209]. Only 120 (12.3%) of
[ADDRESS_1045813] a baseline creatinine value estimated using a
previously described three-variable formula [26]. Mul-
tiple alternative approaches to missing baseline cre-
atinine data will be explored in sensitivity analyses,
including use of complete cases, multivariable single
imputation, and use of the first creatinine after en-
rollment or the highest or lowest creatinine during
the study (see Additional file 2).
Post hoc analyses
In the event that investigators or reviewers introduce
analyses in addition to those described above, these will
be clearly delimitated as post hoc and will be considered
hypothesis-generating.
Presentation of the results
After completion of enrollment and data analysis, the re-
sults of the trial will be communicated to the public
through manuscript publication and submission of the
results to the ClinicalTrials.gov database. Submission for
publication will include public access to the full study
protocol and statistical code. Authorship will be based
on the International Committee of Medical Journal
Editors guidelines, and professional writers will not be
used.
The flow of patients through the study will be pre-
sented in a flow diagram (Fig. 3). Baseline characteristics
will be presented by [CONTACT_1570], as shown in
Table 1 and Additional file 2: Table S2. The volume of
isotonic crystalloid administered, other fluids, and blood
products administered over time will be presented by
[CONTACT_1570] (Additional file 2: Table S3). Serum
values for sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate,
blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine will be presented in
figures displaying serum values over time by [CONTACT_763260]. Trials  (2017) 18:129 Page 8 of 13
in tables detailing the incidence of abnormal values
(Additional file 2: Table S4). Clinical and renal outcomes
will be reported by [CONTACT_1570], as shown in Table 2.
For the primary analysis of the primary outcome, we will
present the unadjusted frequency and proportion of
MAKE30 in each study group, as well as the adjusted
OR, 95% CI, and Pvalue derived from the generalizedlinear mixed-effects model. Indications for new RRT are
displayed as in Additional file 2: Table S5. Heterogeneity
of treatment effect analyses will be displayed as locally
weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) curves or par-
tial effect plots for continuous variables and forest plots
for categorical variables.
Discussion
Upon completion, SMART will provide the most com-
prehensive data to date on the comparative effects of
saline versus balanced crystalloids among critically ill
adults. Given that isotonic crystalloid administration
represents the most common intervention provided to
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], saline and balanced crystalloids are
the only available options for isotonic crystalloid adminis-
tration, and also that the relationship between saline and
AKI and death remains unclear, the results of SMART will
have immediate implications for the care of a broad popu-
lation of acutely ill patients. Results showing superior clin-
ical outcomes in the balanced crystalloids group would
provide compelling evidence that balanced solutions
should be considered the preferred isotonic crystalloid for
most acutely ill patients. Better clinical outcomes with sa-
line would cement 0.9% sodium chloride as the first-line
isotonic IV fluid and end the current debate about optimal
crystalloid composition. In this comparative effectiveness
trial of thousands of critically ill adults, a finding of no dif-
ference between groups would still have important impli-
cations for clinical care and future research. In a trial
powered to detect absolute risk reductions as small as 2%
in clinical outcomes, no difference between groups would
imply that the effect of crystalloid choice for the majority
of ICU patients is minimal, and any future research would
need to be focused on select subpopulations.
While designing SMART, we weighed the relative
advantages and disadvantages of multiple study designs,
including a blinded, patient-level randomized trial. A
major challenge to controlled studies of fluid administra-
tion in critical illness is the ability to enroll patients
prior to the period of highest fluid exposure. Because
the majority of fluid is administered as part of resuscita-
tion in the ED and during the first [ADDRESS_1045814] readily available in
the study unit. The enrollment of all adults admitted to
the participating ICUs examines the effects of salineTable 1 Patient characteristics at baseline

versus balanced crystalloids in a real-world clinical
environment, improving the generalizability of the study
findings. Coupling group assignment at the level of the
ICU with relatively short periods (1 month) and frequent
crossovers (at least 11 in each unit) balances baseline
characteristics and cointerventions better than a simple
cluster-randomized trial or before-and-after trial with
the same number of units, decreasing confounding by
[CONTACT_763246].
Although blinding of treating clinicians and study
personnel to the assigned intervention would be ideal,
researchers in a prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_763210]-
ment despi[INVESTIGATOR_589392], perhaps owing to the overt effect
of the study crystalloids on clinically available laboratory
values such as serum chloride and bicarbonate [13]. Useof an objective, patient-centered primary outcome
abstracted automatically from the EHR increases the
pragmatic nature of the design and diminishes the risk
of observer bias.
Several potential threats to the validity of our trial
exist. Including all patients admitted to each study ICU
may produce a patient population with limited average
exposure to the study interventions [13, 14]. On the
basis of our preliminary data from the same units prior
to this study, however, we anticipate that more than
90% of enrolled patients will receive isotonic crystalloid
and at least 25% of patients will receive more than 4 L
of isotonic crystalloid, which is comparable to or
greater than that received in prior positive ICU fluid
trials [30]. Additionally, we have prespecified analyses
to evaluate for a dose-response relationship betweenTable 2 Clinical outcomes

ICUIntensive care unit, RRT Renal replacement therapySemler et al. Trials  (2017) 18:[ADDRESS_1045815] enrollment criteria may pro-
duce a study population at relatively low risk for
adverse clinical outcomes. The anticipated incidence of
the primary outcome of 15%, however, is comparable to
that of other large ICU fluid management trials [30, 31].
Treating clinicians are aware of study group assignment,
which may permit a treatment bias in which clinicians ad-
minister less isotonic crystalloid and/or more nonisotonic
crystalloids when assigned to one of the fluid groups. For
this reason, we will record and report use of not only iso-
tonic crystalloid but also nonisotonic crystalloid, colloid,
and blood products during the trial. Group assignment at
the level of the cluster with multiple cluster-level cross-
overs introduces the possibility for intracluster correlation,
interperiod correlation, and intracluster intraperiod cor-
relation, which may confound the relationship between
group assignment and clinical outcome. In preparatory
analyses using data from more than 10,[ADDRESS_1045816] of
intracluster correlation to be minimized by [CONTACT_763261]-
riods and frequent crossovers and the effects of intraper-
iod correlation and intracluster intraperiod correlation to
be small (see Additional file 2: Supplemental methods).
Our primary analysis uses a generalized linear mixed-
effects model to account for these aspects of the study
structure. In the absence of a washout period, there will
be carryover of crystalloid administration from one group
assignment into the other; however, on the basis of pi[INVESTIGATOR_763211], we anticipate the volume of nonassigned crystalloid
received as a result of carryover will be low [14], and we
prespecify secondary analyses to address the effects of car-
ryover. Finally, although MAKE30 is a recommended out-
come for clinical trials involving AKI [24, 32], use of a
composite outcome presents potential challenges. Unlike
death and new receipt of RRT, whether persistent renal
dysfunction on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174157] a patient-centered
outcome remains a point of discussion. Persistent renal
dysfunction also relies on the availability of serum creatin-
ine measurements at baseline and before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_156827]-
charge, potentially requiring imputation of missing data
for one component of the composite primary outcome.
Perhaps most important, although death, new receipt of
RRT, and persistent renal dysfunction are weighted equally
in the MAKE30 composite outcome, they may not repre-
sent equivalent outcomes to patients or providers. To ad-
dress this, we will provide data on the MAKE30 outcome
overall and for each of its separate components.
Trial status
SMART is an ongoing, pragmatic, cluster-level alloca-
tion, cluster-level crossover trial that will compare salineto balanced crystalloids with regard to major adverse
kidney events among critically ill adults. Patient enroll-
ment began on 1 June 2015, and enrollment is scheduled
for completion on 30 April 2017.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which causes cognitive decline and 
brain atrophy associated with the pathologic accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins. 
Passive immunization with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains amyloid antibodies 
and has been investigated as a potential safe diseas e-modifying strategy for Aβ clearance in 
AD. 1,[ADDRESS_350104] study investigating early administration of IVIG given in the pre -
dementia stage, MCI (mild cognitive impairment), of AD. The details of this randomized, double- , placebo -controlled trial have been previously published. 
3 Patients with MCI were 
randomized to receive either 0.4 g/kg of IVIG or 0.9% saline solution every [ADDRESS_350105] been proposed. IVIG also contains tau antibodies  
and has other immunomodulating properties including regulating effects on microglia which may be beneficial in modulating neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD. 
4-7  
There has never been a published study in humans using amyloid imaging to demonstrate the 
treatment effects of IVIG in MCI. Here we propose use of both amyloid brain PET imaging and 
retinal amyloid imagin g (a novel surrogate scanner used to determine amyloid burden) to 
determine if IVIG treatment results in a measurable reduction in amyloid.  
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
     3.1   Primary Objective  
This is a proof of concept study is to determine if changes in brain amyloid levels as measured by [CONTACT_286933], as well as retinal amyloid levels in the retina are evident three months after 
infusion of 0.4 g/kg of IVIG every [ADDRESS_350106] uptake values (SURV)  as measured by [CONTACT_286934] 3 
months  and Retinal Amyloid Index  (RAI)  as measured by [CONTACT_286935].  
[ADDRESS_350107] retinal amyloid levels measured , receive an infusion of IVIG at 0.4 
g/kg every  [ADDRESS_350108]  of male  and female subjects  diagnosed with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer disease (AD).

     7.1   Description of study drug 
Octagam  is an FDA approved 10%  human normal  immunoglobulin solution ready  for 
intravenous  administration.  Adverse Drug Reactions  (ADRs)  reported for Octagam  are 
expected to be similar  in type and intensity  to those reported with other  IVIG preparations.  
The Octagam  manufacturing process achieves a significant viral reduction through a 
combination of two dedicated manufacturing process steps: solvent/detergent (S/D) 
treatment and nanofiltration (20 nm). Based on the combination of these two steps, Octagam  
complies wit h the latest international consensus on best practices for viral safety. The 
Source Q chromatography (ion- exchange chromatography) step in the Octagam  process 
also contributes significantly to the viral safety of Octagam . The efficacy of the virus 
inactivation procedures  has been extensively  validated according  to relevant  international  
guidelines  in place.  Further  information can be found in the current  Investigator’s  Brochure.

in the Pharmacy  Binder.  A temperature logger  showing  the transport  temperature will be read 
out by [CONTACT_286936] 
+2°C  to + 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  If there was a deviation from this temperature range,  an 
Octapharma Project  Manager  or Qualified Person must  assess the temperature log and 
approve release.  
The study  drug will be stored in a secure  area with access restricted only  to authorized 
personnel.  Octagam  may be stored for 15 months  at +2°C  to + 8°C (36°F to 46°F)  from the 
date of manufacture.  
 
     7.3   Special precautions for storage

     7.6   Study drug preparation and infusion  
• The pharmacist  will prepare the IVIG for each infusion.  
• The IVIG should be inspected visually  for particulate matter  and discoloration prior  
to administration,  whenever  solution and container  permit.  Do not  use if turbid 
and/or  discoloration is observed.  
• The IVIG must  not be mixed  with other  medicinal  products  or administered 
simultaneously  with other  intravenous  preparation in the same infusion set.  Do not 
mix with IVIG products  from other  manufacturers.  
• Do not freeze.  Solutions  that have  been frozen should not  be used.  
• IVIG bottle is for single use only. Octagam  contains  no preservative.  Any bottle  that 
has been entered should be used promptly.  Partially  used  bottles  should be 
discarded.  
• Content  of IVIG bottles  may be pooled under  aseptic  conditions  into sterile infusion 
bags  and infused within  8 hours  after pooling  (within 72 hours  if stored at 2-8°C [36-
46°F]).  
• Do not use after expi[INVESTIGATOR_78288].  
• IVIG should not be diluted.  
• IVIG must  be allowed to warm  to room  or body  temperature prior to infusion  if stored 
at 2-8°C (36-46°F).  
• 0.4 g/kg body  weight  of Octagam  10% is transferred into an EVA infusion  bag. 
 
     7.[ADDRESS_350118]  not be mixed  with other  medicinal  products  or administered simultaneously  
with other  intravenous  preparations  in the same infusion set. 
 
     7.8   Administration  
• Octagam  should be at room  or body  temperature during  administration.  Only 
administer  intravenously.  
• Any bottle that  has been opened should be used promptly.  Partially  used bottles  
should be discarded.  
• Octagam  is not supplied with an infusion  set. If an in-line filter is used  the pore 
size should be 0.2  – 200 microns.  
• Do not use a needle of larger  than 16 gauge  to prevent  the possibility  of coring.  Insert  
needle only  once,  within the stopper  area delineated (by [CONTACT_286939]).  The stopper  should be penetrated perpendicular  to the plane of the 
stopper  within  the ring. 
 
     7.9   Rate of administration  
The initial infusion  rate of IVIG (Octagam ) will be 0.01 mL/kg/min (60  mg/kg/hr)  for the first 30 
minutes;  if tolerated,  advanced to 0.02 mL/kg/min  (120 mg/kg/hr)  for the second 30 minutes;  
Sutter Institute for Medical Research   PI: [INVESTIGATOR_104460], MD  
Page  11                                                                                                                              v 
9.22.17 if tolerated,  advanced to 0.03 mL/kg/min  (180 mg/kg/hr)  for the third 30 minutes  and, if 
tolerated,  advanced to 0.04 mL/kg/min (240 mg/kg/hr)  for the remaining  time at the discretion 
of the treating Investigator . 
If adverse events  (AEs)  occur  during  infusion,  the rate should be reduced to half the rate at 
which  the event  occurred,  or the infusion interrupted until symptoms  subside.  The infusion 
may then be resumed at  a rate tolerated by [CONTACT_102].  
The batch number(s)  and number  of different  vial sizes  used will be recorded on the drug 
accountability  form.  
 
     7.1   Concomitant therapy

treatment  until the end of study  (visit 7 or ET visit).  The event  need not have a causal 
relationship with the study  drug or treatment.  Adverse events  include,  but are not limited  to 
clinically  significant  changes  in clinical status,  physical  or neurological examinations,  ECG,  
abnormal laboratory  findings,  exacerbations  of underlying  disease,  and drug interactions,  
dependency,  misuse  and abuse.  All AEs must  be documented on the Adverse  Event  page of 
the CRF and in the  subject’s  medical notes.  Each  AE is evaluated for duration,  severity,  
seriousness,  relatedness  to study  drug,  and action  taken.  The investigator  may be asked to 
provide follow -up information.  
 
     10.2 Serious adverse event (SAE) definition  
A serious  adverse event  is one that  at any dose  (including  overdose):  
• Results  in death 
• Is life-threatening1 
• Requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity2

Other  reactions  that should be reported in an expedited manner  although 
they did not immediately  result  in one of the above  seriousness  criteria  
     10.3 Other relevant drug safety information  
Any safety  information relating  to: 
• Pregnancies/breastfeeding,  
• Drug  abuse (persistent, sporadic  or intentional excessive use of a medicinal 
product  inconsistent  with the SPC or acceptable medical  practice),  
• Overdose (treatment  exceeding  the medically  recommended dose),  
• Medication errors  (prescribing  or dispensing  error),  
• Interactions  with other  medicinal products  or devices  
• Associated with Octagam  10%,  even if no adverse drug reaction occurred.  
 
1“Life-threatening”  means  that the subject  was at immediate risk of death  at the time of  the serious  adverse event;  it 
does  not refer to a serious  adverse event  that hypothetically  might  have  caused death if  it were more  severe.  
2“Persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity”  means  that there  is a substantial  disruption of a person’s  ability  to 
carry  out normal  life functions.  
 
     10.4 Adverse event severity  
Severity  of AEs will be assessed using the National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  Common 
Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events  (CTCAE)  Version 4.0 for toxicity  and adverse event  
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE  Version 4.0 can be downloaded  from the CTEP  homepage  
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov ). AEs not corresponding  to the CTCAE  term will be assessed  
according  to their impact on the subject’s  ability  to perform  daily activities  as follows:  
• Mild (grade 1) – the AE does  not interfere in a significant  manner  with 
the subject’s  normal  functioning  level.  It may be an annoyance.  
• Moderate (grade 2) – the AE produces  some impairment  of functioning,  
but is not hazardous  to health.  It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  
• Severe (grade 3) – the AE produces  significant  impairment  of functioning  
or incapacitation and is  a definite hazard to the subject’s  health.  
• Life threatening (grade 4) – Life threatening  or disabling.  
• Fatal  (grade 5)  Causes  death of the participant.  
The investigator  must  appraise all abnormal  laboratory  results  for their clinical significance.  If 
any abnormal  laboratory  result  is considered clinically  significant,  the investigator  must  
provide details  about  the action taken with respect  to the test drug and about  the patient’s  
outcome.

event,  and an assessment  of the causal relationship between the event  and the 
investigational  product(s).  Information not available at the time of the initial report  (e.g., an 
end date for the adverse event  or laboratory  values  received after the report)  must  be 
documented on a follow - up form.  A final report to document  resolution of the adverse event  
is required.  
 
     10.6 Investigator reporting to the FDA  
Adverse drug reactions  that are serious,  unlisted/unexpected,  and at least  possibly  
associated to the drug,  and that have  not previously  been reported in the Investigators  
brochure,  or reference safety  information document  should be reported promptly  to the FDA in

     13.3 Data monitoring committee  
The Data Monitoring  Committee  (DMC)  will be composed of independent  reviewers  who will 
meet  to review  the efficacy  and safety  data and determine a risk/benefit  analysis  in this 
subject  population.  The purpose of the DMC  is to advise  on serious  safety  considerations,  lack 
of efficacy,  and any  other  considerations  within the charge to the Committee. The DMC may 
request  additional meetings  or safety  reports  as deemed necessary  upon discussion  with the 
investigator  or Octapharma and its  representatives.  The DMC  may stop the study  following  
review  of results  from the interim  analysis.  
[ADDRESS_350140] uptake ratio values (SURV) of Florbetapir PET will be 
compared between baseline and 3 months. G raphs of individual changes in RAI values will  be 
compared between baseline and 3 months.  
15 SAMPLE SIZE 
Five subjects will be included. If it appears that IVIG shows changes in these two markers, a 
large trial will be considered.  
16 IMPLICATIONS AND DIRECTION FOR FUTURE STUDIES  
This study will help determine if the reason that IVIG treatment appears to reduce brain atrophy in patients with MCI is due to a reduction of CNS (central nervous system) amyloid levels.  
17 ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES  
The study  will be submitted to the SHIRB.  A data safety  monitoring committee will be 
convened to provide oversight  of subjects’ safety  before commencement  of the study.

wave  activity  
3. Evidence of  cerebral  atrophy  on CT with progression documented by 
[CONTACT_286946]  
20.0.2 Other  clinical features  consistent  with the diagnosis  of probable 
Alzheimer  disease,  after exclusion of causes  of dementia other  than 
Alzheimer  disease:  
• Plateaus  in the progression of the illness  
• Associated symptoms  of depression,  insomnia,  incontinence,  delusions,  illusions,  
hallucinations;  catastrophic  verbal,  emotional,  or physical outbursts,  sexual

9.22.17 20 APPENDIX C: INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORBETAPIR PET  
Imaging will be acquired on a Siemens Biograph mCT (Ultra High- Definition PET/[ADDRESS_350149]) scanner. Dosing will be 10 mCi Florbetapir in a peripheral vein with saline flush. A 10-
minute acquisition will be obtained 30 to 50 minutes after administration. Image data will be 
processed by [CONTACT_286947] (TOF, PSF modeling, scatter) [ADDRESS_350150]/nuclear 
medicine physician trained to read Florbetapir studies. Patients with positive studies 
(moderate to frequent beta amyloid neuritic plaques) will be included in the study and will 
undergo a repeat Florbetapir PET/CT brain imaging study 3 months later after treatment with 
either IVIG or placebo.   
 Analysis: Florbetapir is normally washed out of the cerebellar cortical gray matter in bot h 
healthy controls (HC) and in Alzheimer’s dementia patients (AD). As such, it is used as the reference region for SUVR calculation. Regions of interest will be drawn around areas of 
cerebral gray matter in the frontal, lateral temporal, parietal and parieto -occipi[INVESTIGATOR_286932]/CT images and SUVRs will be calculated using the ratio of these SUV values to the value in the cerebellar gray standard uptake value.

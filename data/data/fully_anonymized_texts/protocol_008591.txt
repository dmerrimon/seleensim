In Cohort 5 (birth to < 3 months) only the single -dose regimen of dalbavancin
(22.5 mg/kg ) will be evaluated. At the discretion of the invest igator , concomitant therapy  
based on l ocal standard of care m ay be added to the single- dose regimen of dalbavancin, as 
clinically indicated, in Cohort 5. Cohort 5 will be init iated based on review of init ial result s 
from patients > 28 day s to < 3 m onths in study  DAL -PK-02 (DUR001- 107).
Eligible patients from birth to 17 years of age (inclusive) with acute bacterial skin and skin

Additional, Non -Study Therapy Antibiotics:
For Clostridium difficile infect ions, m etroni dazole (IV or oral) or oral vanco mycin may be 
used in all treatm ent groups.
Other antibiot ics that do not achieve significant therapeutic concentr ations in the serum 
(e.g., ni trofurantoi n)may be considered for treatment of other concomitant infect ions. 
Close consul tation wi th the m edical  monitor is advised pri or to use of these ant ibiotics.
If a Gram -negat ive bacteremia develops during the study , or is subsequent ly found to have 
been present at Baseline, the patient should be removed fro m study  treatm ent and receive 
appropriate antibiot ic(s) to treat the Gram -negat ive bacteremia.
Statistical Methods: 
The proposed sample size is approximately 188 pati ents, such that 188 patients are 
included in the Safet y Populati on: 76in the single -dose arm of dalbavancin , 76in the 
two-dose armof dalbavancin , and 26in the comparator arm.   Theenrollment target of 
10patients for Cohort 5 (birth to < 3 months), includes at least 5 patients ≤ 28 days
(including pre -term neonates) bringing the total number of patients enrolled in the study to 
approximately  188 pati ents.

Confidential Page 15of 107General Statistical Considerations:
The study  is primarily  a safety  study . Safety resul ts and adverse events will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_153990], including those who did and did not receive addit ional agents 
(such as aztreonam and/or metronidazo le). Descriptive statist ics, including the numbers 
and percentages for categorical variable s, and the numbers, means, standard deviat ions, 
medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables will be provided.  
Summaries of efficacy variables will be done by [CONTACT_153991], who have values available at the 
appropriate visit s. Expl oratory  analyses may  also be performed.  List ings o f individual 
patient’s data will be produced. 
A comprehensive Statist ical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to closure of the 
database . 
Primary Analysis (Safety)
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_153992], collection of 
adverse events and clinical laboratory  tests.  Phy sical examinat ion will be performed at 
Baseline; vital signs will be collected at Baseline, and at Day 1, [ADDRESS_177653] 
rando mizat ion, Day 8 (± 1 day ), Day  14(± 2 days), Day  28 (± 2 day s), Day  54 (± 7 days), 
or at premature discont inuat ion.  Adverse events will be co llected at every visit, beginning 
from the signing o f Inform ed Cons ent.  Clinical laboratory  tests needed to determine 
eligibilit ywill be collected during screening , if not already  collected as standard of care .  
Data from clinical laboratory  tests performed as standard of care during the study  will be 
collected.
Audio logic testing will be conducted in at least 20 children < 12 years old (in selected 
centers), of which at least 9 children will be < 2 years ol d. Audio logic testing will be 
perform ed at Baseline and repeated at Day  28 (± 2 days) . Testing (as specified in the
protocol ) perform ed wi thin [ADDRESS_177654] of dalbavancin on the bowel flora will be determined in all patients from birth

Secondary Analys es:
The study  is desi gned to determine the safet y and descript ive efficacy o f a single -or a two-
dose regimen of IV dalbavancin administered one week apart ,relative to the comparator 
regimen (IV vanco mycin or IV oxacillin or fluclo xacillin with option to swi tch to oral  
cefadroxil or clindamycin, as noted ). Of note, all patients in Cohort 5 (birth to < 3 m onths) 
will receive the single -dose regimen of dalbavancin.

Cohort 5, rescue therapy  is defined as addit ional ant ibiotic therapy init iated after at least 
48 hours o f start of  study  treatment) .
Clinical response at remaining t ime-points will be based primarily on the global clinical 
assessment of the patient made by [CONTACT_153994]-point. 
Clinical response atthe End of Treatment ( EOT ) visit (14 ± 2 days) is defined as Cure, 
Improvem ent, Failure, or Unknown; 
Clinical response at the TOC visit (28 ± 2 days), and at the fo llow-up visi t (54 ± 7 day s) is 
defined as Cure, Failure or Unknown.
Cure: Resol ution of  the clinical signs and symptoms of infect ion, when co mpared to 
baseline. No addi tional antibact erial treatment is required for disease under study .
Improvement : Reduct ion in severit y oftwo or m ore, but not all, clinical signs and

as reduction in severit y of at least one abnorm al clinical and laboratory  param eter related 
to sepsis (see Inclusio n Cri teria f or Cohort 5) ,when co mpared with baseline . No addi tional 
antibacterial tr eatment is required for disease under study . This outcom e category  will only 
be used at the EOT evaluation. For Cohort 5, no rescue medication is required af ter at

Failure : Persi stence or progression of baseline clinical signs and symptoms of infect ion 
after at least 2 day s (48 hours) of treatment or development of new clinical findings 
consistent with active infection.
Unknown : Extenuating circumstances preclude classifica tion to one of the above.
When classifying the patient 's clinical response using the criteria listed above, "no 
additional antibacterial treatment is required for the disease under study" refers to: no 
additional treatm ent with an ant ibacterial agent with activity against the patient's isolate is 
requi red for the disease under study . The occurrence of any of the fo llowing condi tions 
will result in reassignment by  [CONTACT_153995]:
Patients previ ously  assessed as a clinical failure: the outcome will al ways be 
clinical failure at subsequent time-points.
For Cohorts 1 –4 (3 months to 17 y ears of age, inclusive): Patients who were given 
a concomitant antibiot ic with act ivity against the patient's isolate for the disease 
under study  prior to the evaluat iontime- points will be classified as a failure. For 
Cohort 5 (birth to < 3 months): Patients who are given rescue therapy (additional 
antibiotic therapy  initiated af ter at least 48 hours of  start of  study treat ment) will 
be classified as a failure.
If a patientundergoes an unplanned surgical procedure (e.g., incisio n and drainage

Dalbavancin is a lipoglycopeptide approved in the [LOCATION_002] and European Unio nfor the 
treatm ent of ABSSSI in adults.  Dalbavancin is highly active against Gram -positive bacteri a, 
including streptococci and S. aur eus, including MRSA; the MIC 90for S. aur eus is 
0.06 µg/mL.
In adults, dalbavancin (given intravenously  as 1000 m g on Day  1 followed by  500 mg on 
Day 8), has been shown to be non -inferior (NI) both to linezolid alone and to a comparator 
regimen including vanco mycin followed by  [CONTACT_153998] (ABSSSI )/complicated skin and skin structure infect ions

with ABSSSI has also been studied (DUR001 -303). This study  dem onstrated that a single 
1500 mg infusio n was no n-inferi or to the sam e total  dose delivered as 2 infusio ns 1 week

dose and a two -dose, once weekly dosing regimen. Dalbavancin was well tolerated in these 
studi es, wi th a higher proportion of pat ients in the comparator group reporting an adverse

audiogram s were wi thin norm al limi ts. There was no evidence of ototoxicit ydue to 
dalbavancin administration in a majorit y of patients; for the remainder, no determinat ion 
could be m ade.
Dose rationale for  dalbavancin: Upon com pletion of Study  DUR001- 106, a popul ation PK 
analysis was conducted to support just ification o f the dosing regimen in pediatric
patients[17].The populat ion PK analysis was based on a pooled pediatric PK dataset from
43 subjects aged 3monthsto 16 y ears. Incorporation of the covariates body  weight and 
serum  albumin were together able to account for the age -related differences in PK 
compartmental model parameters. Resul ts of Monte Carl o sim ulations of exposure, 
represented by [CONTACT_12265] 0
-120, over the age range of 3 months to 18 y ears are shown in Figure 1
for dosing regimens of 12 m g/kg and 15 m g/kg, respect ively . Based upon these results and 
the stated goal of attaining expected exposures equivalent to those attained in adults, the 
following two -dose regimen was chosen for equivalence to the 1000/500 mg adult regimen:
Age ≥ 3 months to <6 y ears: 15 m g/kg on day  1, 7.5 m g/kg on day  8 (m aximum  
1000 mg day 1; maximum 500 mg on day  8)
Age ≥ 6 years to <18 y ears: 12 m g/kg on day  1, 6 mg/kg on day  8 (maximum 
1000 mg day 1; maximum 500 mg on day  8)
In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_36652] h the observed dose -proporti onali ty of exposures over the range of doses tested 
in adults and pediatri c patients, the corresponding single -dose regimen would be a single -
dose equivalent to the sum of two -dose regimen, as has been proposed for adults. Therefore, 
the following regimen was chosen based on projected exposure equivalence to the 1500 mg 
adult regimen:
Age ≥ 3 months to < 6 years: 22.5 mg/kg on day  1 (m aximum 1500 mg)
Age ≥ 6 years to < 18 years: 18 m g/kg on day  1 (maximum  1500 mg)
Simulations were also performed to find a single dose regimen for children aged 
birth to3months thatwould provide exposures similar to those expected in adult patients
administered a single 1500 mg dose. The results of these simulat ionsindicated that the 
following dose regimen was appro priate for children younger than 3 m onths of age :
Age birth to < 3 months: 22.5 mg/kg on day  1(maximum 1500 mg)

5 S TUDY TREA TMENTS
5.1 Allocation to T reatment
This is a rando mized open -label study  evaluat ing dalbavancin wit h a comparator regimen in 
the treatment of pediatric ABSSSI.
The study is planned to enroll approximately  188patients, such that 1 88patients will be 
included in the Safet y Populati on. After a patient signs the ICF at the baseline visit, study 
personnel will register the patient in the IWRS, and the system will assign the p atient a 
sequent ia
l Patient Identificat ion (PID) number . The first patient to sign the ICF at each study 
center will be assigned the first number in the sequence by [CONTACT_1190].
Patients ≥ 3 months will then be rando mized to receive dalbavancin (single -dose or two- dose 
regimen) or a comparator, in a 3 :3:1 randomization scheme: 76patients will be randomized 
to dalbavancin ( single -dose IV), 76patients will be randomized to dalbavancin (2 IVdoses 
one week apart ), and 26patients will be rando mized to comparator (IV vanco mycin or IV 
oxacillin or fluclo xacillin ),based on an IWRS -generated randomization schedule .  The 
rando mizat ion scheme will not include the y oungest age cohort (birth to < 3months of age), 
as all 10 patients in this cohort will receive the singl e-dose regimen of dalbavancin , bringing 
the total number of patients enro lled in the study  to approximately 188 patients .
There will be 5 age cohorts: 12 years to 17 years old, inclusive (Cohort 1) ; 6 years to 
< 12 years ol d(Cohort 2) , 2 years t o < 6 years o ld(Cohort 3) , 3 m onths to < 2 y ears ol d
(Cohort 4), and fro m birth to < 3 months (Cohort 5) . Wit hthe except ion of Cohort5, 
patients will be rando mized 3:3:1 to each of the three treat ment groups .
In Cohorts 3 and 4 (enrolling patients aged 2 years to < 6years ol d and 3 m onths to 
< 2years ol d, respectively ), there will be approximately 15 patients in each dalbavancin 
arm. In Cohorts 1 and 2 (12years to 17 years old, inclusive and 6 years to < 12 years ol d, 
respectively ),there will be appr oximately 23patients in each dalbavancin arm, and [ADDRESS_177710]

Admissio n exclusively for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeut ic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , shoul d not 
be reported as an AE.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
perform ed shoul d be reported if it meets the definit ion of an AE.  For example, an acute 
appendicit is that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the 
resul ting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.7 Important Medical Event
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an event is an 
important medical event.  An important medica l event may  not be immediately life-
threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094].  However, if it is determined that the 
event m ay jeopardi ze the pat ient and/or may require intervent ion to prevent one of the other 
adverse event outcomes, the impor tant m edical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]; 
or development of drug depen dency  or drug abuse.

defined as fo llows:
MILD:  Does not interfere with the pati ent’s usual funct ion.
MODERA TE:  Interferes to some extent with the patient ’s usual funct ion.
SEVERE:  Interferes significant ly wit h the patient ’s usual funct ion.
8.[ADDRESS_177742] igator ’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all A Es (seri ous and non -
serious); the invest igator must record the causal relationship in the CRF , as appropri ate, and 
report such an assessment in accordance wit h the serious adverse reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An invest igator ’s causalit yassessment is the determinat ion of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibilit y that the study  drug caused or contributed to an AE.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not study drug caused the event, then the event will be 
handled as “related to study drug ” for reporting purposes, as defined by [CONTACT_1034] ( see 
Secti on8.13 on Reporting Requi rements).  If the investigator ’s causalit y assessment is 
“unknown but not related to study  drug ”, this should be clearly documented on study  records.  
Specifically , the inve stigator will choose whether the AE is unrelated, unlikely related, 
possibly  related or probably  related to dalbavancin or any of the comparators used by [CONTACT_4677].
In addit ion, if the invest igator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, t he 
investigator must record this causal relat ionship in the source documents and CRF , as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance wit h the SAE reporting 
requi rements, if applicable.
The Investigator will assess causalit y of the event in rel ation to dalbavancin based on the 
following defined criteria: 
UNRELA TED: No rel ationship between the event and medicinal product
UNLIKEL Y, Event or laboratory  test abnorm ality, with a time to drug intake that 
makes a rel ationship improbable (but not impos sible); Disease or other drugs provide

investigat ional product, or the female beco mes, or is found to be, pregnant after 
discontinuing and/or being direct ly exposed to the investigat ional product (m aternal  
exposure) .
If any study  patient becom es or is found to be pregnant during the study  patient’s treatment 
with the invest igational product, no further study  drug should be given and the invest igator 
must submit this informat ion to Sponsor on a Pregnancy Form .  In addi tion, the invest igator 
must submit information regarding environmental exposure to dalbavancin in a pregnant 
wom an (e.g., a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to dalbavancin by 
[CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the Pregnancy Form . This reporting must be done irrespect ive of whether an 
AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy .  The informat ion 
submitted should include the ant icipated date of delivery  (see bel ow for informat ion related 
to induced terminat ion of pregnancy).
Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome informat ion on all Pregnancy reports 
with an unknown outcom e.  The invest igator will follow the pregnancy until co mpletion or 
until pregnancy terminat ion (i.e., induced aborti on) and then notify  the Sponsor of the 
outcom e.  The invest igator will provide this informat ion as a fo llow up to the init ial 
Pregnancy Form .  The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified.  A Pregnancy 
report i s not created when an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pr egnancy  is not 
usually viable.  Rather, an SAE case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy .
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classificat ion as an SAE 
(i.e.,spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congen ital anom aly [including that in 
an aborted fetus, stillbirth ,or neonatal death]), the investigator should fo llow the procedures

(e.g., follow-up on preterm  infants to ident ify developmental delays).
8.11 Discontinuation from Study Drug Due to AEs (See also Patient 
Withdrawal, Section 6.3)
Patients will  be advised they are free to withdraw from study  drug administrati on and/or from  
the study  at any  time.  Over the course of the study , the Invest igator(s) and/or the Sponsor 
may discont inue administration of study drug to a patient in the case of unnecessary risk, 
adverse drug events, or noncompliance.  When a patient withdraws or is withdrawn fro m the 
study  medication, all safet y data norm ally requi red at the end of the study  will be obtained, if 
possible.
Discontinuati on from study  drug due to an AE should be dist inguished from discont inuat ion

The study will enroll approximately 188 patients from  birth (inclusive) old (such that 
188patients will be included in the Safety Populati on).Patients 3 months and ol der will be 
rando mized to receive dalbavancin or comparator, in a 3 :3:1 randomizat ion scheme: 
76patients will be rando mized to dalbavancin ( singl e -dose IV), 76patients will be 
rando mized to dalbavancin (2 doses once weekly IV therapy), and 26 patients will be 
rando mized to comparator (IV vanco mycin or IV  oxacillin or fluclo xacillin ).The 
rando mizat ion scheme will not include the y oungest age cohort (birth to < 3 months of age), 
as all 10 patients in this cohort will receive the singl e
-dose regimen of dalbavancin , bringing 
the total number of patients enro lled in the study  to approximately 188 patients .  No pati ent 
in Cohort 5 (bi rth to < 3months) will be randomized to the comparator arm.
The enrollment target for Cohort 5includes at least 5 patients ≤ 28 days (including pre -term 
neonates) .  
There will be 5 age cohorts:
Cohort 1 –12 years to 17 years old, inclusive ,
Cohort 2 – 6 years to <12 years o ld,
Cohort 3 –2 years to < 6 years o ld, 
Cohort 4 – 3months to < 2 years old , and
Cohort 5 –birth to < 3 months of age (including pre -term neonates with gestati onal 
age ≥ 32 weeks ).
Withthe exception o f Cohort 5, patients will be rando mized 3:3:1 to each of the three 
treatm ent groups .  In Cohorts 3 and 4 (enrolled patients aged 2 years to <6 years ol d and

kIf an exudate/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/pus sample can be obtained per Appen dix3, it should be cultured by [CONTACT_12082], which 
should also conduct organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing. In all patients who are considered 
treatment failures, direct demonstration of eradication or persistence of the causative organism must be done.
lAudiologic testing will be conducted in at least 20 children < 12 years old (in selected centers), of which at least 9 
children will be less than 2 years old. Audiologic testing to be conducted on infants (<12 months old) will include: 
evoked otoacoustic emissions testing, acoustic immittance measures (tympanom etry and contra and ipsilateral acoustic 
reflex thresholds) and (optional) threshold auditory brainstem responses. For the older children, testing will include 
evoked otoacoustic emissions, acoustic immittance measures (tympanometry and contra ipsilateral acoustic reflex 
thresholds) , and age appropriate behavioral audiologic threshold assessment. Testing will be performed at Baseline and

absence of orga nisms and as well as squamous and polymorphonuclear cells.
A Gram -stain of material obtained from the site of a skin infect ion provi des supportive

Gram -stain could st ill be considered microbio logic evidence of infection and a Gram -stain 
ident ifying a target organism and inflammat ion may not necessarily  provide evidence of 
infect ion without addi tional posi tive results obtained through culture.

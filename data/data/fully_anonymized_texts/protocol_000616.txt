Induction Phase (Berger and Bowman1 Scale)  
Numeric Scores  
0 = No evidence of irritation  
1 = Minimal erythema, barely perceptible  
2 = Moderate erythema, readily visible; or minimal edema; or minimal papular  
response 
3 = Strong erythema; or erythema and papules  
4 = Definite edema 
5 = Erythema, edema and papules  
6 = Vesicular eruption  
7 = Strong reaction spreading beyond test site  
 
Letter Grades (always upper case)  
A = Slight glazed appearance  
B = Marked glazing  
C = Glazing with peeling and cracking  
F = Glazing with fissures  
G = Film of dried serous exudate covering all or a portion of the patch site  
H = Small petechial erosions and/or scabs  
 
Challenge Phase  
Inflammatory Responses  
0 = No visible reaction  
+ = Slight, confluent or patchy erythema  
1 = Mild erythema (pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745])  
2 = Moderate erythema (definite redness)  
3 = Strong erythema (very intense redness) 
 
Definition of letter grades appended to a numerical grade:  
 
E = Edema - swelling, spongy feeling when palpated  
P = Papule - red, solid, pi[INVESTIGATOR_623648]  
V = Vesicle - small elevation containing fluid  
B = Bulla reaction - fluid-filled lesion (blister)

h = Hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (loss of visible pi[INVESTIGATOR_89328])  
f = Fissuring - grooves in the superficial layers of the skin  
 
Each of the scores represents the presence of a clinically significant effect that is localized in a  
representative portion of the patch area, defined as 25% or more of the patch site. Questionable  
(barely perceptible, minimal or involving less than 25% of the patch site) reactions as well as the  
+ designation are inconclusive and are not included in calculation.  
 
9. P
ROCEDURE  
 
9.1 Consent 
 Subje
cts will be given an informed consent form (ICF) to read and sign.  They will have all of their study related 
questions answered by [CONTACT_623650]. Subjects who qualify based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enroll ed into the study.   
 
9.2 Method of Application:  
 Occl
usive – Test products to be studied under occlusive conditions will be applied on a 25- millimeter Hill Top 
Chamber®, consisting of an outer ring and an inner, flexible flange.  Within the chamber is a non-woven Webril ® pad.  The chamber is surrounded by a Durapore® semi -occlusive, hypoallergenic adhesive tape.  
 
 9.[ADDRESS_830417] Products:  
 
The test product will be applied on the 25- millimeter Hill Top Chamber®, which will be applied directly to the test 
site. Enough product will be used to cover the chamber.   
 Positive Control:  
0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, Missouri) in distilled water will be applied as a positive control.  Positive control is applied on the same type of occlusive patch as the test product and is applied to the intrascapular region of the subjects’ back.  Positive control remains on the subjects’ skin for 48 hours.  The patch is 
removed, and the positive control site will be evaluated according to the Berger and Bowman
6 Scale  by a trained  
ALS staff member.  Positive reactions are notated  and reported in final report.  Positive Control will only be applied 
for Induction 1.  
 Negative Control:  
Distilled water will be applied as a negative control. Negative control is applied on the same type of occlusive patch 
as the test product and is applied intrascapular regions of the subjects’ back.  Negative control remains on the 
subject skin for 48-[ADDRESS_830418] Preparation will be performed as noted below unless otherwise requested by [CONTACT_2728].  
Prepare ColActive Plus Collagen Matrix Dressing samples using the following method:  
 
Step 1:  ColActive Plus Collagen Matrix Dressing: cut with sterile scissors to fit the chamber of the patch (25-
millimeter diameter).  Step 2:  Place the test article directly on the Hill Top Chamber®.  
   Step 3:  0.8mL of distilled water will be dispensed to saturate the test product. *

    Step 4:  Place a Hill Top Chamber® on the test site.  
 *Visual inspection will be done to confirm the entire test article has come in contact [CONTACT_623651] a gel.  
  
9.[ADDRESS_830419] Sites / Procedure :  
 
The pa
tches will be applied directly to the skin of the intrascapular regions of the back, to the right and/or left of the 
midline, and/or upper arms.  
 
Subjects will be given a Panelist Instructions for  the Safety Patch Test. Subjects  will be dismissed with instructions 
to keep the test area dry while the patches are in place and to not expose the test area to direct sunlight.  Subjects 
will be instructed to notify clinical staff during the course of the study should they begin using a ny new medications, 
cease taking any medications or have any change in their medical condition.  
 Patches will remain in place for a minimum of [ADDRESS_830420] patches remain on until the following Monday (72 hours). 
 The procedure will be repeated until a series of [ADDRESS_830421] will be evaluated according to the Berger and Bowman6 Scale  (Section 8. 
Experimental Techniques and Methods).  
 
The Sponsor will be notified within 1-[ADDRESS_830422] who:  
•exhibits an erythema score of 2 or greater  
•exhibits papules, vesicles, bullae and/or spreading beyond the patch site, regardless of the degree of erythema  
•requires follow -up 
 If any subject exhibits a grade [ADDRESS_830423] -
removal evaluation during the challenge phase (Grade 1, 2, and 3 only), the Investigator may decide to schedule a 
re-challenge patch test for confirmatory purposes.  This follow -up investigation will be conducted approximately 4-[ADDRESS_830424] substance should be applied under the same testing conditions 
(concentration and patch type) to confirm delayed contact [CONTACT_376787]-reactivity. Related substances (product reformulations, individual ingredie nts, ingredient groups, etc.) can also be applied to aid in determining the 
causative relationship but must be pre -approved prior to application.  
 
 
10. SUBJECT DISCONTINUATION  
 The removal of a study subject by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_623649]:  
1. Adve rs 
e Event  
2. Concomitant treatments or illnesses incompatible with the study  
ALS                                         Page [ADDRESS_830425] that they may, of their own free will, withdraw 
their consent to participate in the study, if they so wish.  
4. Loss of follow -up 
5. Emergence of a non-inclusion criterion  
6. Researchers' decision  
7. Protocol violation  
 
Those subjects who, for some reason, are discontinued from the study will not be replaced. Data from these subjects 
will not be analyzed unless the reason for their discontinuation was related to the investigational product.  
The Investigator should carefully  track and  document all premature discontinuations and their reasons on study 
documentation  and also, when necessary, on the "adverse event" form, as well as on the study documentation. 
 
11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 The most commonly observed reactions in this study are:  
1.  Itching, redness, rash, peeling, swelling and in rare cases blistering.  
2.  There is also a possibility of getting a reaction from the tape possible resulting in hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371].  
There also may be risks and discomforts, which are not yet known.  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable medical occurrence experienced by [CONTACT_423], whether or not the event 
may be related to the test article.  
 Each adverse event must be promptly recorded and sufficiently documented by [CONTACT_623652]. Adverse events are graded on a scale of severity (mild, moderate, severe, or lift threatening) and on a scale of relationship to the product (unknown, unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). All adverse events will be reported to the Sponsor within five  business days.  All adverse events will be followed up until 
resolved, stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up or the event is otherwise explained.  All follow -up information 
should be reported to the Sponsor.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) as defined in the CFR 312.32 is "any experience that is fatal or life threatening, is 
permanently disabling, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or is a congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose". All 
serious adverse events will  be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of ALS Beauty & Personal Care notification.   
 If, according to the Investigator, medical care is warranted, appropriate referrals will be made. ALS Beauty & Personal Care will follow adverse events until resolution.  
 12. PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
 
Any changes to the study protocol will be approved in writing by [CONTACT_623653] , unless immediate change is necessary to eliminate hazard to the 
subject(s).   Any violations in the study conduct will be documented as protocol deviations.  Protocol amendments will 
be signed by [CONTACT_397076].   
 13. ST
UDY REPORT  
 A final report will be issued to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_830426] reporting for skin sensitization (contact [CONTACT_190032]) will be based on scores after the 72hour patch removal of challenge phase.  
 15. RECORDS RETENTION  
 All original samples, raw data sheets, technician’s notebooks, correspondence files, a copy of final report and 
remaining specimens will be maintained on the premises of the clinic in limited access marked storage files. A 
duplicate copy of the final report will be separately archived at ALS.  All records pertaining to this study will be 
retained by [CONTACT_367867], for a period of not less than six (6) years  following the submission of the final report.

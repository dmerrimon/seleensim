RV-FOL -GELARC -0683C Amendment 5
Date : 08 Jan 2024 6OVERALL RATIONALE FO R PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 5.0:
The rationale for thisprotocol  amendment is to include an additional criterion,which is time 
driven ,tothe existing criterion,which is event sdriven ,to trigger the final progressi onfree survival 
(PFS;co-primary endpo int) analysis and therefore the endof the study .
Based on preliminary assumpt ions in t he init ial versio n of the protocol, a median PFS of 83months 
(6.9 years) was expected with standard treatm ent (rituximab plus chem otherapy ),and the object ive 
was to increase themedian PFS by 30% with the experimental treatm ent (rituximab plus 
lenolidomide ), ie, an expected median PFS of 108 mo nths (9 years). To detect this difference wit h 
a power of 80% and a bilateral alpha risk of 5%, 456 PFS events (assessed by [CONTACT_151798] [IRC] ) were required .
A decrease in the number of PFS events (progression/relapse) , asassessed by [CONTACT_26732], over the 
past 4years has been noted, decre asing from [ADDRESS_250873] noprogression /relapse events to be detected .As 
follicular lympho ma is an indolent lympho ma and yearly computed tomography  (CT)scans are 
not recommended ,a significant number of pati ents who are f ollowed for an extended peri odwill
not have CT scans at the di screti on of  the invest igator. Of note, the recent PFS curve assessed by 
[CONTACT_209996] a plateau.
Taking into account published data for this study (Mor schhauser, 2022) and the uncertainty  of 
reach
ingthe expected 456 PFS events in 9 years , using a median foll ow-up period of  9.5 y ears to 
trigger the final PFS analysis (with anestimated study  end date of30Apr2024) is not anticipated
toimpact the overall results of the study .
Addit ional minor changes have 
been made related to administrative informat ion. This protocol
amendment represents cumulat ive changes to the original protocol.

Design of the trial This multi-center, ope n-label study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of
rituximab plus lenalido mide versus rituximab plus chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_209998] b .
The study i s divided into the Screening Period, Treatment Period, and F ollow-up Peri od.
Once a patient gives written consent, the patient may enter the Screening Period, which 
is permitted to last up to [ADDRESS_250886]-of-care regimen (“investigator’s choice”) for the patient from a list 
of permitted choices of rituximab -containing chemotherapy regimens. In addition, during 
the Screening Period, the subject will undergo safety and other assessments to determine 
eligibility for the study and undergo randomization to either experimental arm (rituximab 
plus lenalidomide) versus control arm (“investigator’s choice” of rituximab -
chemotherapy).  
Thepatientwill enter the Treatment Period once the patient has fu lfilled the required 
assessment in the Screening Period and has been randomized. Treatment must start as 
soon as possible after randomiza tion but no later than 2 weeks after randomiza tion. 
Treat mentPeriod for eachpatientstarts with firstintake of study drug,which is defined 
as Study Day 1 of Cycle 1. The patients willreceiveprotoco l-specified treatments until
(1)inabili tyto achieve a 25% reduction in the sum of the products of the diameters 
(SPD) by 12 weeks (first CT assessment), (2) inabili ty to achieve a response by 24weeks 
(second CT assessment), (3) relapse or progression ofdisease, (4)withdrawal ofconsent 
or (5) unacceptable toxici ty.
Allrandomize d patients will
be fo llowed for progr essionfreesurviva land overall 
survival using the same schedule. This includes all pa tients who discontinu ethe study
early foranyreaso n withou tdocu mented evidence of diseaseprogress ion.
Uponcompletion of the required treatments, the subject will enter the F ollow- Up Period. 
In the f oll
ow-up period,thepatientswill be followe d for di sease progression and overall 
surviva l.

Patients exhibiting a PR after six cycles receive an additional 3 or 6 cycles of the 20 mg 
lenalidomide dose until they achieve a CR/CRu at which time they receive the 10 mg 
lenalidomide dosing for 9 or 6 cycles respectively for a total of 18 cycles. Patients who 
remain in PR after the additional 6 cycles will receive 10 mg lenalidomide dosing for a 
total of 18 cycles.
All patients randomized to receive rituximab -lenalidomide receive rituximab, 375 mg/m2
on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycle 1, day 1 of cycles 2 to 6; and 8 weeks later responding 
patients continue with 375 mg/m2rituximab every 8 weeks for 12 cycles . 
Lenalidomide treatment is continued for 18 cycles or until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary withdrawal. 
The lenalidomide dose for each patient will be interrupted and modified following 
toxicity as described in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4. If a dose is reduced, re - escalation 
is not permitted.

reductio n in the sum of the products of the diameters (SPD) by 12 weeks (first CT 
assessment), or 2) a response of at least PR by 24 weeks (s econd CT assessment) will be 
withdrawn from the study treatment and followed for survival and PFS using the same 
schedule of assessments as patients continuing treatment as described in Table 1.
Screening and 
RandomizationOnce apatient gives written consent, the patientmay enter the Screening Period,which 
is permitted to last up to 4 weeks. During the Screening Period, theinves tigator will 
choose one standar d-of- care regimen (“inves tigator’s choice”)fo rthepatientfrom the
listofpermitted choices of rituxima b-containing chemotherapy regimens.
Inaddition, during the Screening Period, the patientwillunderg osafety and other 
assessments to determine eligibili ty for the study andundergo randomization to either 
experimental arm (rituximab plus lenalidomide) versus contro larm (Inves tigato rsChoice
of R-CH OP,R-CVP, orR-B).
Screening and rand omization will be performed via IVRS/IWRS.
Statistical Analysis Sampl esize:
Sample size calcula tionis based on providing adequate power to evaluate treatment 
effect on the co -primaryefficacy endp oints. 
Theco-primar yefficac yendp ointsarecomplete response (CR/CRu) rate at [ADDRESS_250887] be shown that the 
experimental arm is super ior to thecontro larmat=0.05 level based onCR/CRu rate at 
120 weeks which could be the basis for an early  approval or based on PFS to obtain full 
approval (Shih, 2003 ).
It is hypothesized that the complete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120week sis 60% in the 
control arm and 72% in the experimental arm. For 90% power to detect this difference 
with tw o-sided =0.05, atotalof 644patients(32 2 ineacharm)will berequired.
Considering the sample size requirements for both co -primary  endpoints, it is planned to 
enroll a total of approximately [ADDRESS_250888] the difference of 12% of complete response (CR/CRu) rate between arms 
will be 98%.
It ishypothesized that the median PFS is 83 months in the control a rm, and there is a 
30% increase in the median PFS in the experimental arm (corresponding hazard ratio of 
0.7692). For 80% power to detect this difference with tw o-sided = 0 .05, atotalof 456 
progression/relapse/death events will be required. It is planned to randomize a total of 
approximately 1000 patients in 1:1 ratio to the two treatmentarms (about 500 in each 
arm).
Analysis Plan:
Theco-primar yefficac yendp oints are the complete resp onse(CR/ CRu)rateat120 
weeks and the PFS. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITTpopula t
ion. 
Analy sis based on the mITT population is supportive.
The number and percent of patients with complete response (CR/CRu) at the [ADDRESS_250889] is ≤ 0.05 in favor of the 
experimental arm. The primary analy sis will be performed using a stratified Cochra n-
Mante l
-Haenszel (CMH) test to adjust for possible confounding effects of the 
stratifica tionfactors: FLIPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] (0-1 vs 2 vs 3-5), Age (>60 vs <60),longes t diamete r
ofthe l argest node (>6 v < 6 cm).Theun-stratified test will be a supportive analysis.
The Kapla n-Meier estimates of PFS func tion will be provided. If a patient has a missing 
or incomplete CT scan, all other available CT scans or MRIs of the patientwill stillbe
used for the analy sis. The experimental arm will be declared su perior if the tw o-sided p-
valuefro
ma stratified log -ranktest is ≤ 0.05 in favor of the experimental arm.

The secondary efficacy endpoints are CR rate at [ADDRESS_250891] oyed to interpret the analysis results of these

Time of analysis :
Interim analysis for futility
For the co -primaryendp oint ofthe complete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks, two 
interim analyses for futili tyare pre-planned:
The first interim analysis will be performed when the first [ADDRESS_250892] had disease 
progression or died prior to this timep oint. 
The se cond interim analysis will be perfor med when the first [ADDRESS_250893] had disease progression 
or died prio r to this timep oint.
Theinten tion of these two interim fut ility analy ses is to assess ris k-benefit and ensure 
patient safe t
y. The proposed fu tilityboundar ies are no n-binding.  The resu lts of these
twofutility analy ses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_210005] m ake recommendation 
ofgo/no go.  There is no plan to claim efficacy super iority b ased on the se interim results, 
therefore, no T ype I error rateadjus t mentisneeded.
Interim analysis for efficacy
The co -primar yendpointPFS will be analyzed as an interim analysis at the 
timepoint when the co -
primary  endpoint CR/CRu rate at [ADDRESS_250894] had disease progression or died p rior to the 120 week assessment. 
In order to control the overall alpha for PFS, an alpha spending function of Gamma 
Family with parameter -2.5 will be applied. It is estimated that around 228 PFS events 
(ie, 0.50 information) would occur at the first inte rim PFS analysis, and 342 PFS events 
(ie, 0.75 information) are required at the second interim PFS analysis. The final PFS 
analy sis will be performed based on a total of [ADDRESS_250895] on PFS will be reached if the two -sided p-value is  ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_250896] interim PFS analysis, or ≤ 0.019 at the second interim PFS analysis, or ≤ 0.039 at 
the final PFS analysis . 
Final analysis
The final analysis will be performed:
for the co -primary  endpoint CR/CRu rate at 120 weeks: when all randomized 
patients have their response assessments done at [ADDRESS_250897] had disease 
progression or died prior to the 120 -week assessment ,
for the co -primary  endpoint PFS: when the required 
456progr ession/relapse/death events have occurred among all randomized 
patients or,at the latest ,when 9.[ADDRESS_250898] .
The alpha level for the final analysis may be adjusted based on the total number of PFS 
events if the study is terminated prior to accumulating the originally planned 456 events.

4.1 Follicular lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymph oma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoprolifera tive malignancies 
with differing patterns of behavior and responses to treatm ent (Armita ge, 1993). Most of the NHLs 
are of 
B-cellorigin. The prognosis depends on the histol ogic type, stage ,age, and treatm ent. 
Follicular lymph oma (FL) is the most frequent low grade NHL accounting for approximately 20%
ofallNHL. FListypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y indolent with a median overall survival of 7-10 years. Although FL 
responds well to trea tment it is characteri
zed by [CONTACT_210012] (Salles , 2007) . Transfor m ation to diffuse large B-celllympho mais relatively common in
patients with FL occurring at a rate of approximately  2-3% per yearforat least 15 years ( Bast ion,
1997 ).Eventually m ost FL patients dieoflymph oma regardless of the treatmentinitiated.
Both clinical and biolo gical(immune signature) prognosti c factors have been reported (Solal -
Celigny , 2004; Federico , 2009 ;Dave , 200 4).  The high incidence (~90%) of BC L-2deregulat ion 
involving a t(14;18) transl ocation in FL forms the basis for PCR assessment ofminimal residual 
disease (MRD) in FL (Rambaldi , 2002). The substan t ialspontaneous remissio n rate (Horning ,
1984 ),prognost ic value of the l ocal immune response (Dave, 200 4) and immune suppressi on 
(Ramsay, 2009 )com mon in FL all pointto the importance of the host immune response in this 
disease.
4.[ADDRESS_250924] ofCare Therapy inPreviously Untreated Follicular
Lymphoma
Localized stages (Stage I and II) of FL are typi[INVESTIGATOR_209952] d with l oco-regiona lradiotherapy . Watch 
and wait is a strategy that has been empl oyed by[CONTACT_210013], low tumor 
burden FL and in some cases even for advanced stage disease FL patient s. There is, however, 
consensus that previously untreated FL patients with advanced stage symptoma tic or bulky diseas e
(Stag e IIbulky disease, Stage III and IV) are in need of systemic therapy (Salles , 2007).
H
istorically FL lymph oma ha s been treated wi th single agent or combinat ion chemotherapy ( Van 
Hend e, 2007 ).The addi tion of ri tuximab, a monocl onal antibody with specific ity for the B-cell 
CD2 0antigen, to combination chem otherapy  has consisten tlydemonstratedincreased overall 
response rates, response durations and in some studi es an overall survival benefit (Salles , 2007) 
establishing rituxima b
-chemotherapy regimens as standard therapy forpreviously untreated FL 
patients in need oftreatment. The National LymphoCare study which studiedtreatments 
administered to 2,[ADDRESS_250925] oftenused rituxima b-chemotherapy regimens 
(Friedberg, 2009). R- CVP is also approved as first line therapy for FL in the US.
I
n late 2009 ,theStiL group reported results from a Phase 3 study tocompare the efficacy  and 
safety of ri tuxima b-bendamus tine (R- B)versus R-CHOP as first l inetherap y for patients with FL,
indolent and mantlecelllymph omas (Rummel ,2009 ). Five hundred forty nine pa tients in nee d of
treatment were randomized to treatment with 2 doses of bendamus tine(90mg/m2) and1dose of
rituxim ab (375 mg/m2) every [ADDRESS_250926] R-CHOP regimen every 21 days, for a
maximum of 6 cy cles. Pati entcharacteris tics were well balanced and a median number of6 cycles

months. Overall response rate for patients treated wit
h R-B was similar to the CHO P-R group 
(93,8% vs 93,5%, respectively). The CR rate was significan tly higher with40.1% for R-B 
compared to 30.8% for R-CHOP (p=0.0323). Medi anPFS was significan tly longer after R-B 
compared to R-CHOP: 54.8 versus 34.8 months (p=0.0002), hazard ratio (HR) 0.5765 (95%

Theapproval of rituximab by [CONTACT_210014] a maintenance agent in previously 
untreated FL patients responding to rituxima b-chemotherapy  further anticipates the apparent 
evolution of the rituxima b-bendamus tine combina tion.
In 2010 the GELA (Salles , 2010) reported results from the PRIMA Phase II Istudythat invest igated
2 years of ri tuxima b(R) maintenance infollicular lymph oma (FL) patient s responding to firs t-line 
immunochemotherapy  consis tingofeither8cycles ofR-CVP , or 6 cy cles of R- CHO P or R- FCM
(plus 2 addit io nal rituximab infusio ns).1,217 patients were enrolled and75% received R-CHOP 
induction, 22% R- CVP and 3% R-FCM. 1,018 eligible patient s responding to induc tion therapy
were randomized (stratified by[CONTACT_210015])toobserva tion orR-
maintenance , 375 mg/m 2 i. v. every 8 weeks for 2 years. The primar yendpo int of PFS was met at 
the planned interim analysis (ITT: 513 observa tion, 505 rituximab maintenance). Medi an follow-
up was 25 months from randomization (31monthsfrom studyentry).Ther ewas a si gnificant 
(stratified log-rank, P<.0001) improvement in the primary endp ointPFS,for R-ma intenance 
(hazard ratio [HR]=0.50; 95% CI [0.39-0.64]; 2-yearPFS 82%; 95% CI [78-86%] vs 66% [61-
70%
]forobservatio n). Time to next ant i-lymphoma treatment, as well  as response rate at the end 
of maintenance or observat ion, were significan tly improved in the R-ma intenance arm.Themost 
common AEs were infec tions (22% observatio n,37% R-ma intenance) .Grad e 3-4 AEs were
reported in16% (observa tion) and 22% (R-maintenance) of patients (neutropeni a 1% vs 4%; 
infec tions 1% vs 4%, respect ively). The authors concluded that the study demonstrate s [ADDRESS_250928] 
of care for FL patients in need of treatment. Based upon the resul ts of the PRIMA study (Salles ,
2011), both the European (October 2010) and [LOCATION_002] (February 2011 )regulatoryagencie s

4.3 Lenalidomide
Lenalid omide (REVLIMID®Celgene Corp., NJ, [LOCATION_003]) is a member of a class of pharmaceu tical 
compounds known as immun omodul atorydrugs (IMiD®);and has potent immun o-modul atory, 
anti-angiogenic and pro- apoptot icactivi ties invitro.
It offers potenti al benefi t over the first commer ciallya
vailabl eIMiD®compound, thalidomide, in 
termsofboth safet yandefficac y inhuman patient s (Galustian, 2004 ).The key to i ts therapeutic 
potent iallies inthefactthat ithas multi ple m echanisms ofaction,which acttoproduce both anti-
inflammatory and an ti-tumor effects. These effects are thought to be contextual in that theydepend 
on both the cell typeandthetriggering stimulus. To date, l enalido mide has been assoc iated with
TNF-αinhibitor y, T- cellcostimulatory,andantiangiogenic activities (Galustian, 2004).
Lenalid omid
e is marketed in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatm ent of patients with transfusi on-
dependent anemia due to low- or intermediat e -1-ris k Myel odysplas ticSyndrome(MDS) 
associated with a deletion 5q cy togenet i cabnor mality with or with outadditional cy togenet ic 
abnor malities and in c ombina tion with dexamethasone for patients with previously treated multiple
myel oma. Lenalid omide is also approved and marketed in the US, EU, and Australia, in 
combination with dexamethasone, for the treatm ent of patients with multiple myeloma who had 
been treated with at least one prior therap y.
Lenalid omide is being inves tigated as treatm ent for various hematol ogical and onco logic 
indica tions. Studies have also been conducted in non-onco logic cond itions including complex 
regionalpainsyndro me.

Date : [ADDRESS_250931] that lenalid omide maypromoterestoration of anti-tumor 
immun ological  effects in patients with certain hematol ogical malignancies. Ramsay, 2008 reported 
that impaired T cell immun ological synapse formation was seen in both CD4 and CD8 Tcells
from fol licular lymph oma (FL) patients compared to age-matchedhealthy donors. It wasfurthe r
demonstrated that the immune synapse defects were repaired in part by [CONTACT_210017]. Treatment of both FL B cells and autol ogous T cells with le nalid omide (1μM for 
24h) was requi red to enhance formation of the F-actin synapse. Lenalid omide treatment induced 
actin cytoskeleton reorganiza tion andpolariza tion of MCL cells as early as30 min, a process 
termed “cappi[INVESTIGATOR_007],” which is considered an important subcellular componen t ofthe immune synapse
formation ( Gaidarova, 2009).  Addi t io nally ithasbeen shown thatthe combined use of 
lenalid omide and rituximab enhances NK cell-mediated immune synapse formatio n and the 
resultant cytotoxic ity, versus each agent alone.It was recent ly demonstrated that lenalido mide 
induces CD2 0-localizatio nwithin the “cap,” and that the addition of ri tuximab can enhance 
immune synapse formation (Gaidarova , 2009) .   Thecappi[INVESTIGATOR_209953]20 is accompanied by

rituximab, potentially further enhancing its ac tivity,whic hwould support the clinical c ombina tion 
of these agents.
Gandhi, et al (2009) reported that in FL celllines andprimary cells the lenalido mide-rituximab 
combination produced synergistic anti-proliferative effects, cytotox icity m ediated via non-
immune mechanisms, up regulated expressi on of the p21 gene, maintenance of elevated Egr1 
expressi on and that le nalidomide can potentiate rituxima b-induced cell death through a mechanis m

lenalid omide combinat ion described in the clinical trial protocol.

Three recent clinical studi es have reported that the combina tion of ri tuxima b-lenalido mide yields 
high response rates and high c omplete response rates in patients with FL.
In 2011, Fowler et al reported the resul ts of an ongoing Phase 2 study evalua tingtheefficacy and 
safety of ri tuxima b-lenalid omide in patients with untreated, stage III/IV, indolent NHL. Patients 
with m easurable (>1.5 cm) disease untreated indolent NHL received 20 mg/day of lenalid omide 
on day s 1-21and ri tuxima b 375 mg/m2on day 1 of each 28daycyclefor up to 6 cy cles. Response 
was assessed after every 3 cycles using the IWG (Cheson, 1999 )criteria. At the time ofthis report ,

ollow up of 14.4 (7- 32.5) m onths, 4 patients experienced progressi on of disease. Grade 3/4 
adverse events were rash (7 pts), neutropenia (20 pts), muscle pain (7 pts), thromboc ytopen ia (4
patients)infect ion (3 pts), and thrombosis (3 pts).  Five patientswereremoved fromtreatment due 
to adverse events but were eligible for toxici tyassessment, including [ADDRESS_250933] 2 c ycles. The authors concluded that the bi ologic combina tion of lenalido mide and 
rituximab used as front line therapyproduces excellent overall and complete response rates with 
mana geabl etoxi city i n patients with indolent B cell NHL.
Dutia et a
l(2009)reported the results of a  clinical trial of the combina tion of ri tuximab and 
lenalid omide in 16 patients with relapsed/refractory  indolent l ympho ma.  Patients received 
lenalid omide 20 mg daily for three weeks in 4-week cy cles and also rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly 
x 4 doses starting on day 15.Lenalidom idewascontinued to diseaseprogress ion. The median age 
was 60 years old, m edian lines of prior therapy was 3, and 7 patients were refractory to rituximab. 
Of the 16 patients, 13 had FL. In this subset of FL patients, the response rate was 85%. A CR/CRu 
was achieved in 5 patients (38%).
Ahmadi et al (2009) are conducting a phase II trial of lenalid omide-dexamethason e-rituximab in 
patients with i ndolent B- cell or m antle cell lymphom as refractory  to ri tuximab, defined as failure 
to respond to or progression within 6 months, of rituximab monotherap y,prior ri tuximab 
containing chemothera py, or ri tuximab maintenance. Patients receive two 28 -day treatment cycles 
of lenalido mide 10 mg daily anddexamethason e 8 m g once weekly  (Part 1). Af terassessment of 
response, all patient s receive rituximab 375 mg/m2weekly for 4 doses during cycle 3(Part2).
Lenalid omide-dexamethasone therapy continues during and after rituximab. Of the first 9patients
with FL comp leting both parts of the treatm ent regimen, the response rate was56% and the CR 
rate was 44%.

Lenalid omide pharmacokinetics (PK) hasbeen studi edinhealthy volunteers, patients with renal 
impairment, andpatients withmul
tiplemyel oma (MM) or myelodysplas ticsyndr omes(MDS) 
(Revlimid package insert , 2009 ). Please see the Investigator Brochure for further details.
Renal function is the most important i ntrinsic factor affec tingpharmacokinetic s of lenalido mide. 
With diminishing renal function, totaland renal clearance of lenalid omide decreased while total 
drug exposure AUC and the t1/2increased. Dose adjustment s are recommended for patients with 
CLcr<60 mL/min.
Inpatients with MM (baseline serum crea tininelevel ≤ 1.5 m g/dL) , Cmaxoccurred between 0.5 to
6 hours pos t-dose. Plasma exposure (AUC and Cmax)increases proportionally with dose following
single andmultiple doses (up to 50 mg/da y). In patients with MDS (baseline serum creati ninelevel
≤ upper limit of normal range), the drug was also absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (median tmax=1 h), with 
approximately  65% of the administered dose excre ted unchanged in urine over 24 hours postdose. 
Lenalid omidehalf-life in plasma ranged from 3 to 5 hours i n these MM or MDS patients. As a 
resul t, the drug did not accumulate in plasma upon multiple daily doses. However, exposure 
(AUC) in these patient s was approximately 50-60% higher compared to healthy v olunt eers.This 
is consistent with their compromisedrenalfunction, possibly as a consequence oftheir age and 
their disease.
Thepharmacokine ticsoflenalid omide has not been studied in pa tients with lym phoma, including
f
ollicula rlymph oma, except that PK data is available in adult T -cell leukemia/lympho ma (ATLL ) 
patients .

6.1 Study Design Rationale
Follicula rlymph oma (FL) is a distincthistologi ctypewithin B- cellNHL further divided by[CONTACT_210022] (2007) into three different grades. Within grade 3, grade 3a is differen tiated 
histopathologically fr om3b. FL grade 3b is treated in a manner similar to DLBCL. Thus, FL grade 
3b is excluded fr omthisstudy.
Rituxima b has beco me the backbone of first line treatment for follicular lymph oma patient s who 
are in need of therap y. Recent studi es have established several  standard -of-care immun o-
chemotherapy regimens in previously untreated FL. In most phase [ADDRESS_250935] iontherapy based upon theresul tsofthePRIMA study (Salles , 2011 ).
The current study is designed to i nvestigate theefficacy andsafety of l enalid omidetherapy in 
patients with previouslyuntreate dFL.The multi center nature ofthestudy prov ides assurance that 
the results are likely to have gener alapplicabil ity. The inclusi on of a control arm, and the fact that 
the Inves tigator must select the Invest igator’s choice option of a standar d-of- care for thepatient
before rando mizat ion, is intended to provide a realis tic co mpar ison to current standar d- of- care in 
this pat ient populat ion. Pat
ienteligibili tycriteria are consistent wi th those used in other studi es of 
this popul ation.
Patients are requi red to have measurable disease to facilitate the accurate assessment of CR/CRu, 
which is a direct measure of the co-primary efficac y endpoint CR/CRu rateat120week s. The 
International Working Group (IWG) response criteria were selected to provide an internationa l 
standard for the assessment of lymph oma ( Cheson, 1999). The use of this tool will ensure that data 
across centers are evaluated consisten tly and also allow for direct comparison to historical data.  
Safetywill be assessed by [CONTACT_210023]. AE and abnormal laboratory value
sever i
tywill be graded using versi on 4.03 of the National Cancer Ins titute Comm onTermin ology
Criteria forAEs (NCI CTCAE).
Know ntoxicitiesoflenalid omide,given alone orin combinatio nwith ri tuximab have been 
reported. In addi tion, in the clinical database and safe tydatabase of the sponsor, tumor flare, tumor 
lysis and venous thromboemb olus have been reported, as described further in Section 9.1.
Mon itoring fortumor flare and venous thromboemb olicevents (VTE –includin gpulm onary 
embolism and deep vein thrombosi s)will beperformedalong withsafety me asures that are 
routinely assessed in inves tigationalstudi es of hematologic malignancies. VTE prophylaxis is 
recommended for patients in the lenalid omide arm who are at high risk for a thromboemb olic 
event. VTE, TFR and TLS will be recorde d as AEs.

8.3 Dose Modifications
8.3.1 Lenalidomide Dose Modifications
The lenalid omide dose foreach patient will be interrupted and/or m odified by [CONTACT_210035] 2,Table 3,and Table 4.
Basically, if a significant toxi city, defined as dos e
-limitingtoxicity in Table 2, occurs on or af ter 
da
y 15 of the cy cle,treatment will be held (interrupted) until the end o f the cycle and the dose will 
then be reduced by [CONTACT_210036] (dose level -1)inthesubsequent cycle.
Iftoxicity occurs befor eday [ADDRESS_250959] of the cycle(continue unt il day 21; missed doses will not be 
made up).
Thenext cyclewillresume atreduced dose (dose level -1)insubsequent cycles. In those instances
where intheopi[INVESTIGATOR_209957]-challenge at the same dose level poses an unacceptable 
risk to the pati ent, treatm ent will  be held (interrupted) until the end of  the cycle and thedose will
bereduced by  a step in the subsequent c ycle
In case of recurrence of an event during the same cycle, lenalid omide willbeheld untilthenext 
cycle.
Doses that were missed, due to toxi city or anyother reasons, will not be rescheduled. If a dose i s 
reduced, re-escala tion is not permitted.
There will be no dose adjus tment for ri tuximab. In case of cycle delay due to lenalido mide induce d
toxicity, ri tuximab ofthenext cycle will  also be postponed unt il AEhas reso lvedand recycling is 
allowed.
If dosing is interrupted for toxicit yor cy cle delayed , it can only be restarted if :

9.1.1 TFR Treatmen t-Lenalidomide Arm
Treatment of TFR is up to the discretion of the investigator depending upon the severi tyand 
clinical situation. It i s suggested that Grades 1 and 2 TFR be treated with no n-stero idal anti-
inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs ) [i.e. ibupr ofen 400-600 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed], 
corticostero ids, and/or narcotic analgesics for pain management. Refer toTable 2for f urther 
instruct ions and dose modifica tions fo r Grade 3 and 4 TFR.
Inmild to m oderat ecases , it is suggested that lenalid omide be continue dalongwithsymptom atic 
treatment as above . In more severe cases, lenalidomide should be interrupted, as indicated Table 2.
During the Treatment Phase, emergency use ofcorticostero ids at anydose totreatTFR symptoms 
for a pati ent in the l enalid omide arm is allowed at the Inves tigator’s discret ion.
9.1.2 Thrombo embolism Prophylaxi s-Lenalidomide Arm
It is reco mmended that patients in the lenalido mide arm who are at high risk for a thromboemb olic 
event (high riskincludes but not limited tobulkydisease ,histor y ofa thromboemb olic event and/or 
taking a concomita nt medication associ ated with an increased risk for a thromboemb olic event

10.3.5 Assessments for tumor flare
Tumor flare assessments are conducted in Cycle 1: Days 1, 8, and 15, and when clinically indicated 
thereafter for patients in the experimental arm and suggested for patients in the control arm.
Tumor flare reaction (TFR) is defined in the National Cancer Institute-Co mmonTermin ology 
Criteria f or Adverse Even ts (NC I-CTCAE) versio n [ADDRESS_251000] relation toinitiation of therapy  (NationalCancer Ins titute, 2003 ).
TFR is an adverse effect of lenalid omide previously reported in pa tients with CLL (Chana n-Khan ,
2008a ). TFR hasalso been reported at a  lower rate in clinical studi es of lenalid omidein patients
with non-Hodgkin lymph oma (NHL ) (Witzig, 2009). The characteris t icfindin g of TFR seen in
lymph oma patients treated wi th lenalid omide, is consist ent with f indings in patients wi th CLL; a 
sudden and tender increase in the size of the disease bearing sites, including the lymph nodes, 
spleen and/or the liver, t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_209967] d by [CONTACT_6398]- grade 
fever and non-pruritic di ffuse rash, typi[INVESTIGATOR_209968] (Chana n-Khan ,2008a; 
Witzig 2009). The increase in lymphadenopathy m ay be l ocalized or generalized . The onset of 
TFR has been as early as within a few hours after the first dose withthevast majori tyof TFR 
having occurred within the first [ADDRESS_251001] cycle
oftreatment but can recur to a lesser extent if the dose is increased (Celgene Corporat ion, 2009a ). 
Based on experience in Celgen e
-sponsored clinical studi es, TFR subsides over time and usually
resolves in 1- 2 weeks wit h or without interven tion ( Celgene Corporati on, 2009a ).
The experi ence with tumor flare in Celgen e-sponso red studi es of single agent lenalidomide in 
NHL is now summarized . Over 300 patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive or ind olent non-

Date : 08 Jan 2024 72(NHL-001, NHL -002, and NHL -003) were phase 2 multicenter, singl e-arm,open-label studies 
which evaluated lenalido mide 25 mg/day for 21days of a 28-day cycle in43previously  treate d
patients with i ndolentnon-Hodgkin lympho ma, 49 patients with relapsed/refractory  aggressive 
NHL, and 217 patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive NHL, respectively . These protoco ls
suggested thatany pat ient who experi enced TFR during the first 1 to 2 weeks of  Cycle1may be 
treated symptomat ically wi thnon-stero idalanti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDS) . TFR occu rred in 
4 patients (grade 1 (n=1) and grade 2 (n=3)) in the NHL-001 study, none in theNHL-002 study; 
and 7 of 217 patients in the NHL-003 study(Grade 1 (n=2), Grade 2 (n=2) and Grade 3 (n=3).

n an inves tigato rinitiated study, Ahmadi et al in a single -center ,open-label PhaseIIstudy 
evaluated the use of lenalid omide, dexamethasone and rituximab in patients with relapsedor 
refractory indolent B- cell or MCL resistant to rituximab (Ahmadi  et al ., 2009 ). Am ong 24 patients,
Grade 1 TFR occurred in 1 patient with fo llicular lymph oma.
It is important to note that the increased lymphadenopathy seen inTFRmay mimic disease 
progression (PD). Therefore, careful monitoring andevaluation todifferen tiateTFR from PD is 
necessary foraddressin gtreatment of individual  patients including making decisi ons to 
discontinuetreatment (Chana n-Khan et al. 2008b ). There are currently n olaborator yor 
radiologicalteststhat dist inguis hTFR from PD. The dis tinction may be made on clinical grounds, 
incorporating observa tions such as timing of the event relativeto th estart of lenalid omide, 
associ ated physical findings, laboratory findings, and pace of disease before and afterinstitution
of len alidomid etreatment. Also, in case of TFR, inflamma tionandedema may reduce or disappear 
after short term  treatment wi th NSAID and/or corti costeroids .
Management of TFR is described in Sec tion9.1.1 .
10.3.6 Assessments for tumor lysis
Tumorlysis syndro me assessments are conducted in Cycle 1: Days 1, 8, and 15, and when 
clinically indicated thereafter for patients in the experimental arm and su ggested for pat ientsin the
controlarm.It is recommended that the patient be monitored for TLS during the first week of cycle 
1.Also, the site should make every effortto contact [CONTACT_210057] 5(±1 day) of the first cycle 
to inquire about the patient’s cond itionandtomake sure that he/she is continuin gwith TLS 
prophylaxis measures by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_209969]. Any
patient contact [CONTACT_210049] 5 (± 1 day )shoul d be documented inpatient’s medical record 
and any  AEs th at are di scovered should be captured on the CRF.
Tumorlysis syndro me(TLS) is awell-known constella tion ofmetabolic abnormali tiesresul ting 
fromspontaneous or treatm ent-related tumor necrosis or fulminant apoptosi s. The metabo lic 
abnor malities include: hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia and hyperphosphatemia with secondar y 
hypocalcaemia with risk of renal failure. TLS has been reported in patients receiving rituximab 
plus lenalido mide and rituximab plus chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_210001].
The presence of known
risk factors such as bulky  disease, preexis ting(moderate )renal 
insufficiency, high ALC and high uric acid levels (> 8 mg/dL) prior to therapy are known to 
increase the likelihood of TLS. Early identification of patients at ri sk andthe preven tion of TLS

The experience with tumor lysis syndr o
me in Celgene -sponsore dstudies of single agent 
lenalid omide in NHL is summarized below. Three phase 2 multicenter, singl e-arm,open-label 
studiesevaluate d lenalid omide 25 mg/day for 21 days of a 28-day cycle in 43 previously treated 
patients
with i ndolent non-Hodgkin lympho ma (NHL-001), 49 patients with relapsed/refractory 
aggressive NHL (NHL-002), and 217 patients with relapsed/refractor yaggressive NHL (NHL-
003). All three studi es suggested that patients receive tumor lysis prophylaxis (allopurin olor 
equivalent) and be well hydrated during the first [ADDRESS_251002] 
cycle or as clinically indicated. Grade 1 TLS occurred in 1 of the 309 (0.3%) patients receiving 
lenalid omide.
In an inves tigato rinitiated study,Dutia et al ., in a singl e-center, open-labelPhase IIstudy evaluated 
the use of lenalid omide and rituximab in patients with relapsed orrefractory indolent B-cellNHL
(Dutia, 2009). [ADDRESS_251003] 4 patients treated using the lenalid omidedose of 25 mg developed 
tumor lysis
. Thus, the lenalido mide dose was reduced to 20 mg and allopuri nol prophylaxis was 
used in all subsequent patients with no further TLS events recorded. Inthe current study, it i s 
recommended that patients rando mized to the rituxima b-lenalid omidereceive allopurin ol
prophylaxis (see Section 9.3.1 for m ore inform ation).

Deep vein thrombosis in Multiple Myeloma
In a number of randomized studi es lenalido mide has demonstrated a significan tly increased risk 
ofdeep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulm onary embo lism(PE) in patientswithmultiple 
myel oma who were treated with REVLIMID ® (lenalid omide )combina tion therapy (Revlimid®
Prescribing Informa tion, January 2009). In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_209970] (lenalido mide) in
patients w
ith multi plemyel oma receiving lenalido mide plus dexamethasone, deep venous 
thrombosis and pulmo nary embo lismwere reported in 7.8% and 3.2% of patients, respectively 
compared to 3.2% and 0.9% of patients receiving placebo and dexamethasone. The Eastern 
Cooperative OncologyGroup (ECOG) trial (E4A03) evaluated lenalid omide 25 mg on Days 1 -21
p
lushigh - dose dexamet hasone 40 mg on Days 1-4, 9- 12 and 17- 20 of a 28 day  cycle (RD) versus
lenalid omide plus low-dose dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 (Rd) in patients with
newl y-diagnosed MM.  Overall venous thromboemb olism(VTE) including DVT and PE occurred 
in 25% in the RD arm and 9% in the Rd arm (Rajkumar, 2007) . DVT prophylaxis was to be used 
in both arms. In two Phase III studi es (MM
-009) and (MM-010) of lenalid omide plus 
dexamethasone in pat ients with relapsed or refractory MM, thenumber of patients experiencing a 
thrombotic event in the lenalido mide/dexamethasone arm was 12% versus 4% in the 
dexamethasone alone arm (Revlimid Prescribing Informa t

13.1 Monitoring, Recording andReporting ofAdverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medicaloccurrence thatmay 
appear or worsen in a pati ent during the course of a stud y
. It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening conc omitantillness, aninjur y, or anyconcom itant impairment of the patient’s health, 
including laboratory test values (as specified by [CONTACT_65801]), regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (i.e., anyclinically significant adverse change in the frequency orintensity of a pre-
existingcondi tion) shoul d be consi dered an AE. A di agnosis or syndrom e shoul d be recorded on 
the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or sympto m s ofthe diagnosi sor syndr ome.
An overdose, accidental  or intentional, whether or not it is associ ated with an AE, or abuse, 
withdrawa l,sensitivity or toxicity toaninves tigational product should be reported as an AE. If an 
overdose is associated with an AE, the overdose and adverse event should be reported as separate
terms.
Signs, symptoms or physical findings indica tiveoflymphoma or progression oflymph oma should 
not be reported asan adverse event or serious adverse event. However, if a finding cannot be 
attributed with certain tyto lympho ma or progression oflymph oma,thisfindin g mu stbe reported 
as an adverse event or seriousadvers eevent , as applicable . For examples, 1)a findin g ofdyspnea
or pleuraleffusi o nin apatientexper iencing disease progression outside of the medias tinum or lung 
must be collected as an AE or SAE as applicabl ewhiledyspnea or pleura leffusi on in a patient
experiencing diseaseprogress ion in t he medias tinum or l ungmay be j udge d to be results of d isease
progression and therefore not reported as anAE or SAE; 2) a finding of bowel  obstruction in a 
patient experiencing disease progression outside of the bowel must be collected as an AE or SAE 
as applicable whilebowe lobstruct ion in a patient experiencing disease progressi on in the bowel 
may be judged to be results of disease progressio n.
All pat ients will  be monitored f or AEs during the study.Assessment s may i nclud e monitoring of 
any or all of the follo wing parameters: the patient’s clinical symptom s, laborator y,patho logica l, 
radiological orsurgica lfindings, physical examinat ion findings, or other appropriate tests and 
procedures.
AllAEs will be recorded by[CONTACT_210070]
28 days afterthe lastdose ofstudydrug(s) .AEs andserious adverse events (SAEs) willbe recorded 
on the AE page of  the CRF and in the patient’ssourc edocu ments.AllSAE smustbe reported to

Aqualified Inves tigator will evaluate all adverse events as to:
13.2.1 Seriousness
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dosethat:
Results in death;
Islife-threatenin g (i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_209972], the patient is at immediate risk of 
death fr om the AE);
Requ ires inpa tient hosp italiza tion or prolonga tion of existinghosp italizat ion
(hosp italiza tionisdefined as an inpatient admissi on,regard less of l ength ofstay);
Results in persistent or significant disabili ty/incapaci ty(a substan tial disruption ofthe patient’s
ability to conduct normal l ifefunct
ions);
Isacongenital anomaly/birth defect;
Cons titutes an important medical event.
Importan tmedical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or resul t in death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_12191], or disabili ty, but may jeopard izethepatientor 
requi
re medica l orsurgical interven tion to prevent one of the ot her outcom es listed above. Medical 
and scient ific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should b e considered
serious.
SPM will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as serious adverse events 
regard less of thetreatmentarmthepatient is in (see Section 13.5). This includes any SPM, 
regard less of causal relationship to studydrug[s], occurring atanytime for the durati on of the 
study, fromthe time of signing the ICD up to and including the fo llow- up period of up to [ADDRESS_251024] be considered an “Important 
Medical Event” even if no other serious criteria apply; these events must also be docu mented in 
the appropriate page(s) of theCRF and patient’s source documents. Docu mentation on the
diagnosis of the second primary malignancy  must be provi ded at the time ofreport ing as a serious
adverse event (e.g., anyconfi
rmatoryhisto logy or cy tologyresults, X-rays,CTscans, etc.).
Events notconsidere dto be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209973] r:
A standard procedure for protocol therapy administrat ion.  However, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_209974] a complica tion of therapy  administrati on will be reported as an 
SAE.
Routine treatme nt or m onitoring of thestudi edindicationnotassoc iated with any deter ioration
incondi tion.
The administration of blood or platelet transfusi on as routine treatm ent of  studied indica tion. 
However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209975] a complication of such transfusio n 
remains a reportable SAE.
A procedure for protocol/diseas e-related inves tigations (e.g., surger y, scans, endoscop y,

must be completed.
For each SAE, the Inves tigator will provide inform ation on severi ty,start and stop dates, 
relationship to study drug(s) ,actiontaken regarding study drug(s), and outcome.
13.2.2 Severity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Inves tigator mustassess theseveri ty of theevent.
Theseveri ty/intensity of AEswill be graded based upon the pati ent’s symptom s according to the 
current active minor version ofNationalCancer Institute (NCI) Comm onTermin ology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE, Versi on 4.03); http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/
electroni c_applica tions/ctc.htm#ctc_40
AEs that are not defined in the NCI CTCAE should be evaluated forseveri ty/intensityaccording 
to the following scale:
Grade 1 = Mild –trans ient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no m edica l 
interven tion/therapy required
Grade 2 = Moderate –mild tomoderate limita tion in activity,some assistance m aybe needed ; no 
or minimal medical interven tion/therapy required
Grade 3 = Severe –marke dlimita tion in activity,some assistance usually requi red; medica l 
interven tion/therapy required,hosp italizat ion is possible
Grade 4 = Life threatening –extre melimitationinactivi ty,significant assistance requi red;
significant m edical  interven tion/therapy required,hosp italizat ion or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_209978] 5 = Death - the event results in death]
Specific NCI Working Group or other criteria pertinent to the indicat ion may also be used as 
applicable.
Theterm “severe” is often used to describe the intensi ty of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial  infarc tion) ; the event itself, however, may be of relativelymino rmedical 
significance (such as severe headache). This criteri on is notthe same as “serious” which is based

Theco-primar yefficac yendp ointsarecomplete response (CR/CRu) rate at [ADDRESS_251037] be shown that the experimental arm is super ior
tothecontrolarmat=0.05 level based onCR/CRu rate at 120 weeks which could be the basis 
for an early approval or based on PFS to obtain full approval (Shih, 2003) .
I
t ishypothe sizedthatthe comp lete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks is 60% in the control 
armand 72% in the experimental  arm.  For 90% power to detect this difference wi th two-sided
= 0.05, a total of 644patients (322 in each arm) will be requi red. The power calculat ion for the
response rates is perform ed using EAST v5.[ADDRESS_251038] with 
unspooled variance estimate.
It ishypothes izedthatthe medianPFS is 83 m onths in thecontro larm,andthere is a 30% increase
in the median PFS in the experimental arm (corresponding hazard ratio of 0.7692).  For80% power 
to de tect thi s difference with two-sided α= 0.05, a total of 456 progressi on/rel apse/death events 
will be required.
Considering the sample size requi rements for both co -primary endpoints, it is planned to enroll a 
total of approximately [ADDRESS_251039] the 
difference of 12% of co mplete response (CR/CRu) rate betwe en arms will be 98%.
Therefore, for an enrollment rate of [ADDRESS_251040] six months, 25 patients per 
month in the next 11 months, and 30 patients per m onths thereafter with 6% dropout rate per year, 
a total of 1000 patients in 1:1 ratio to the two treatm ent arms (500 in each arm) will be needed,
with a 40-mont h accrual period and up to 10 years f ollow-up. The analysis ofPFS will occu r in
abou t 142 m onths when the required 456 progressio n/relapse/death events are expected to be 
observed or,at the latest,when 9.[ADDRESS_251041].
Theassump tions used in sample size calcula tionsarederiv ed fromavailable literature, especially 
from th e published results of PRIMA and STiL studies. For the proposed sample size of N = [ADDRESS_251042]. For example, ifthe comp lete response (CR/CRu) rate at 120 weeks is down 
to50% in the control  arm instead of 60%, the proposed sample size of [ADDRESS_251043] 
roughly  97%power to detect a 12% rate difference. If the median PFS reduces to [ADDRESS_251044] a 30% increase in 
the median PFS, and the only impact is that the study durat ion will be reduced to 113 months if
1000 patients are to be rand omized .
A recent meta-analysis has demonstrated that the CR rate at 30 months is well correl ated with 
PFS. The point estimate and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the trial -level  surrogacy 
measures R2WLSand R2Copula were 0.88 [0.77 to 0.96] and 0.86 [0.72 to 1.00], respectively. The

14.5.1 Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints
Complete Response   (CR/CRu) Rate at 120 weeks
The tumor response data will be assessed by [CONTACT_210029] ( Cheson, 1999 ) criteria. Based 
on the CT/MRI schedule, any assessments in a time window of 120 weeks ± [ADDRESS_251048]/MRI assessments should continue as 
scheduled until disease progression. If a patient whose disease was not progressed prior to this 
time window does not have any tumor assessments in this time window, that patient is also 
considered as a non-responder for this primary endpoint.
Progression Free    Survival (PFS)
PFS is an accepted endpoint of clinical benefit for previously untreated FL patient and was the 
basis for the recent approval of rituximab maintenance in this population ( Salles, 2011 ). The 
disease progression statu s will be assessed by [CONTACT_210075] ( Cheson, 1999 ) criteria. PFS is 
defined as the time from randomization into the study to the first observation of documented

mITTpopu lation is supportive.
For the co -primary endpo int CR/CRu rate at 120 weeks, the number and percent of patients with
CR/CRu at120 weeks willbe tabulated by [CONTACT_210077]. The experimental  arm will be decl ared 
superi or if the tw o
-sidedp-valuefroma chi-squar etest is ≤ 0.05 in favor of the experimental arm. 
The primary analysis will be performed using a stratified Cochra n-Mante l-Haenszel (C MH)testto
adjust for possible confounding effects of the stratifica tion factors: FLIPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] (0 -1vs2vs3-5),
Age (>60 vs<60),l
ongest d iameter of the largest node (> 6 v < 6 cm ). The u n-stratified test will 
be a supportive analysis.
For the co-primary endpo int PFS, theKapla n-Meier estimates of PFS function will be prov ided. 
If apatienthas amissin g orincomplete CT scan, all other available CT scans or MRIs of the patient
will st ill be used for the analysis. The experimental arm will be declared superior if the two-sided

14.7 Interim Analysis
14.7.1 Interim Analysis for futility
For the co-primar yendp oint ofthe complete response (CR/CRu) rate at [ADDRESS_251053] anned :
The first interim analysis will be performed when the first [ADDRESS_251054] had disease progressi on or died prior to 
this timep oint.
The second interim analysis will be performed when the first [ADDRESS_251055] had disease progression or died prior to this timep oint.
Theintention of these two interim futility analyses is to assess risk-benefit and ensure patient 
safet
y. Thepropose d futilityboundar iesarenon-binding.  The results of these two futility analyses 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_210080]/no go.
Ther e is no pl antoclaim efficacy super ioritybased on these interim resul ts, therefore, no T ype I
error rate adjustment is needed.
As similarly define dfortheprimar yefficac yendpoint ,anyassessments in a time window of 24 
week s ± [ADDRESS_251056]/MRI assessments should con tinueas schedule d

does not have any tumor assessments in this time window, thatpatientisalso considered as a no n-

Based on the PRIMA study results,thefollowingassumpt ionsare made for simula tions:
1.For the first 100 patients in the control arm when their response data at 6 months are observed, 
their observed CR/CRu rate at 6 m onths is estimated approximately 58% to62%, and their 
observed ORR is approximately 88% to 92%.

EQ-5D
EQ-5D i s a standardized measure of health status developed by[CONTACT_210102] p inorderto 
provide a simple, generic measure of health fo r clinical and econ omicappraisal (EuroQo lGroup,
1990). Applicable toawiderange ofhealthcondi tions and treatm ents, it provides a simple 
descrip tive profile and produces a single index value for health status that can be used in the 
clinical andecon omicevalua tion of healthcare aswell asinpopulati onhealthsurveys.
EQ-5D essen tiallyconsists of 2 pages - the EQ-5D descrip tive system (page 2) and the EQ visual 
analogue scale (EQ VAS) (page 3). The EQ-5D descrip tivesystem comprisesthe following 5 
dimensi ons: m obility,self-care, usual activities, pain/disc omfortandanxie ty/depress ion. Each 
dimensi onhas 3 levels: no problems, some problems, severe problems. The respondent is asked to 
indicate his/her healt h state by [CONTACT_13158] (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate 
statement in each of the 5 dime nsion s. This decisi on resul ts in a 1-digit number expressing the 
level selected for that dimensi on. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5 -digit number 
describing the responden t’shealthstate. Atotal of [ADDRESS_251099] no arithmet ic

Date : 08 Jan 2024 116EORTC QLQ -C30
The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be used as a measure of health-relatedquali ty of life. 
TheQLQ -C30 iscomposed of both multi-it em scales and single item measures. These include five
functionalscales (physical , role, em otional, cogni tive and soci al), three symptom  scales (fatigue,
nausea/v omiting, and pain), a global healthstatus/QOL scale, and six single items (dyspnoea, 
insomnia, appet iteloss,constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficul ties). Each of the multi-item 
scales includes a different set of items – no i temoccurs in more than one scale.
TheQLQ -C30employs a week recall peri od for all items and a 4 -point scale for the func tional and 
symptom  scales/i tems with response categori es "Not at all, ""A little," "Qui te a bit"and "Ver y
much."Thetwo items assessing global health status/QOL utilize a 7-point scale ranging fro m 1
(“Very Poor”) to7(“Excellent”).
All of th e scales and single item measures range in score from 0- 100. A high score represents a 
higher response level. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a high/heal t
hylevelof 
functioning, a high score for t he gl obalhealthstatus/QOL represents a high/good QOL, but a high 
score for a symptom  scale/i tem represents a high level ofsympto matology/problems. (Aaronson 
et al., 1993 )

Birth Control  Methods docum ent (Secti on 2)provides the fo llowing informat ion:
Potenti al risks to the fetus associated with lenalidomide exposure
Definit ion of female of childbearing potential (FCBP)/female not of childbearing potential 
(FNCBP)
Requi rements for counseling of all subjects receiving lenalido mide about pregnanc y 
precauti ons and the potential risks of fetal exposure to lenalido mide
Acceptable birth control  methods for both female subjects of childbearing potenti al and 
male subjects receiving lenalido mide in the study
Pregnancy testing requirements for subjects receiving lenalidomide who are FCBP
2.The Lenalido mide Educat ion and Counseling Guidance Docum ent for each gender (female 
and male; Secti on 3and Secti on4respect ively) must be completed and signed by a trained 
counselor at the part icipating clinical center pri or to each di spensing of lenalido mide. A copy 
of this docum ent m ust be m aintained in the subject’s records for each dispense.
3.The Lenalido mide Inform ation Sheet (Section 5) will be given to each subject receiving 
lenalido mide. The subject must read this docum ent pri
or to starting lenalido mide and each time 
the subject receives a new supply o f lenalido mide.

Date : [ADDRESS_251134] important information I should know about lenalidomide?
1.Lenalidomide may cause birth defects (def ormed babies) or death of an unborn baby.
Lenalido mide is similar to the medicine thalido mide. It is known that thalidomide causes 
life-threatening bi rth defects.
If you are a female who is able to become pregnant:
Do not take lenalidomide if you are pregn ant or plan to become pregnant
You must practice complete abstinence from sexual contact [CONTACT_4490] a male or use two 
reliable, separate forms of effective birth control at the same time: 
for 28 days before starting lenalido mide
while taking lenalido mide 
durin g breaks (dose interruptions) of lenalidomide 
for at least [ADDRESS_251135] dose of lenalidomide 
You must have pregnancy testing done at the following times:
within [ADDRESS_251136] dose of lenalidomide
[ADDRESS_251137] d ose of lenalido mide

if you miss y our peri od or have unusual menstrual bleeding
[ADDRESS_251140] dose of lenalido mide ([ADDRESS_251141] dose if 
menstrual periods are irregular)
Stop taking lenalidomide if you become pregnant while taking lenalidomide
If you suspect you are pregnant at any time during the study, you must stop 
lenalido mide immediately and immediately inform  your study  doctor. Your study 
doctor will report all cases of pregnancy to Celgene Corporation.
Do not breastfeed while taking lenalidomide and for at least [ADDRESS_251142] 
dose of l enalidomide
The study  doctor will be able to advise you where to get addit ional advice on 
contraception.

General principles:
The RELEVANCE studyrequires ahisto logical review of all patients included in the trial at 
diagnosis. The aims of th e centralized histopathol ogystudywill be to confirm the diagnosis of 
follicular lymphoma , according to the criteria of the updated WHO classifica tion 2008 (S. 
Swerd low et al.) f or each included patient. Histological criteria of inclusi onandexclusi onhave 
been detailed in the protocol.
The review process will be co-ordinatedby [CONTACT_210108]. Expert pathologists will meet in LYS A-P, , on a regular 
basis depending on the number of samples received and analyzed.
Therefore for each randomize d patient, tumor ti ssue blocks and bone marrow biops y- or only when 
not possible -unstained slides will have to be sent for analysis and confirma tionof diagno sis to
LYSA-P, , [LOCATION_009] following the process described below. To 
optimize the number of sam ples reviewed, it isadvised to desi gnate a coordinator patho logist per

Summary  of Changes RV-FOL-GELARC -0683C Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 3 RV-FOL-GELARC -0683C Amend 1 Final : 8 June [ZIP_CODE]. JUSTIFICATION FOR AM ENDMENT
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below :
1.The secondary  efficacy object ives in the protocol areupdated to allow adjustment for 
multiplicit y. The number of secondary efficacy endpoints is reduced to  three: EFS, 
TTNLT, and OS.  The other secondary object ives (TTF, TTNCT, ORR and healt h related 
qualit y of life quest ionnaire EORTC QLQ C30) are moved to the exploratory  endpo ints.  
Justification : The secondary  endpoints are revised i n accordance wi th  
regarding multiplicit y.In addit ion, TTF i s not an efficacy endpo ints clearly stated in the 
; TTNCT is very  similar to TTNLT and it will not add value but consume 
alpha; Similar ly,ORR is also moved to exploratory since CR rate is being assessed as co -
primary  endpoint .
2.The overall survival ( OS)will be calculated fro m the time o f rando mizat ion.
Justification :  the statist ical p lan was updated for 
calculat ion of OS f rom the time o f rando mizat ion.
3.Lenalido mide dose adaptati on rul es are am ended. In addit ion, dose adapti on for thyroid 
stimulat ing hormone (TSH) abnormalit y and guidance on m anagement of rash havebeen 
added .
Justification : To improve patient compliance with dosing and study visit schedule, mid-
cycle dose reducti ons are not allowed.  During a cycle, only dose interru ption and restart  
at the sam e dose level are all owed depending upon when the AE occurred and at the 
discreti on of  the treating physician. Based upon the two coordinat ing invest igators 
recommendat ion dose adaptation for TSH and guidance on management of ra sh have 
been added.
4.The PK substudy  is removed from the protocol .
Justification : The sparse PK is removed from the study for  the following reasons:
a. A preliminary  analysis wi th PK data from  multiple disease indications indicate that 
type of cancer does not affect PK of lenalido mide.
b.Drug -drug i nteracti ons between l enalido mide and rituximab is not anticipated, as they 
do not share the same clearance p athway. 
c.Sparse PK data without intensive PK data are difficult to analyze.
dThe drug exposure at one dose level o f lenalidomide plus high exposure variabilit y 
with the sparse PK is not wide enough for a meaningful exposure -response analysis in 
this study.
e.An integrated PK/PD report utilizing historical data in MM/MDS and newly  collected 
data in MCL/CLL is planned to be generated.  This report will show that PK of 
lenalido mide is not sensit ive to the ty pe of cancer, and thus it may  be used to support the 
future filling for FL.

Confident ial and Propri etary 4 RV-FOL-GELARC -0683C Amend 1 Final : 8 June [ZIP_CODE].Modified visit schedule to reduce the number of visits in Cycle 1 ;Day [ADDRESS_251156] cy cle. 
Justification : Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is characterized by  [CONTACT_210113] -cancer treatment. TLS is 
commo n in pat ients with NHL or acute l eukem ia (Howard et al, 2011, NEJM 364: 1844), 
but it is unco mmo n amo ng the patients with fo llicular lympho ma unless the patient has 
high WBC counts or receives ant i-CD20 treatm ent.
Although rare, TLS has been reported in NHL patients treated with lenalido mide, either 
as monotherapy  or in combinat ion with rituximab. One case of grade 1 TLS was reported 
in the 309 relapsed/refractory  NHL pat ients receiving lenalidomide mo notherapy  in three 
Celgene sponsored phase 2 studies.  In a single -center, open -label Phase II investigator 
study , Duti a et al . (2009), evaluat ing the use of lenalido mide plus rituximab in patients 
with relapsed or refractory  indolent B-cell NHL, two of the first four patients (with no 
TLS prophylaxis) receiving lenalido mide dose of 25 mg developed tumor lysis.  After 
initiating TLS prophylaxis wit h allopurino l, no further TLS events were recorded in 12 
additional patients receiving 20 mg lenalidomide dose (Total N=16) (Dutia et al., 2009, 
ASH abstract #1679). 
TLS and tumor flare reaction (TFR) hav e comm only been observed in pat ients with CLL, 
who were treated with lenalido mide.  In some CLL patients, tumor flare and tumor lysis 
have been life -threatening and fatal.  Based on early  CLL resul ts from CC-5013- CLL-
001, frequent monitoring visits were in cluded during the first cy cle in protocol s 
evaluat ing lenalido mide in CLL and lympho ma patients, including the current study . 
Since then, more experience wit h lenalido mide in CLL populat ions has been gained with 
the current CLL -[ADDRESS_251157] 55 subjects (26 received lenalidomide) enrolled into the CLL -008 study . No 
clinical TLS was reported. One case of laboratory  TLS was reported however it could not 
be confirmed according to the Cairo -Bishop definition and didn’t result in any dose 
modificati on. 
Results to date, demonstrate that with implementatio n of TLS prophylaxis, TLS risk 
(which was the basis for the very  frequent visits) could be mit igated.
In the current FL study , the pati ents randomized to the rituximab
-lenalido mide:
receive allopurino l prophylaxis and are strongly recommended to be well 
hydrated especially during the first week of lenalidomide administration.  
have 6 visits during the 28 day s of Cycle 1 on Days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 22 with blood 
draws on Day s 1, 2, 4, 8, 15 
The am endment proposes to reduce the cy cle 1 m onitoring visi ts from 6 to 4 as follows: 
have 4 visits during the 28 day s of Cycle 1 on Day 1, Day  8, Day  15, Day  22 of

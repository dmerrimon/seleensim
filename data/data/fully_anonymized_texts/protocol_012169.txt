Dosing regimen:  Approximately 2.5 mg/kg/day (maximum: 150 mg per day) for 28 days.  
Dose:  The daily dosage for subject s of body weight 30 -45 kg is 100 mg miltefosine (2 capsules 
Impavido 50 mg). Subjec ts with a body weight higher than 45 kg receive 150 mg miltefosine 
daily (3 capsules Impavido 50 mg). The dose is administered orally, with meals.  
 
STUDY PROCEDURES  
Subjects with ML or CL from which Leishmania  have already been  identified are potentially 
eligible to be treated with miltefosine via this protocol. Treating Physicians with potentially 
eligible subject s will contact [CONTACT_360491] (PI), and receive the case report 
forms ( CRF ) from the PI. The Treating Physician will complet e the  screening CRF pages for  
demographics, medical history, leishmaniasis history, clinical laboratory results  that are 
available , and identification of Leishmania  in the lesion, and send the  completed CRF pages  to 
the PI. If after PI [INVESTIGATOR_345], the subject  is potentially eligible for the protocol, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_360455], the miltefosine package insert,  the informed consent form , and a blank copy of FDA 
form [ADDRESS_449421] already been approved by 
a “central” I nstitutional Review Board (IRB) , if there is an additional need to have the Treating 
Physician’s local IRB approve the protocol, the Treating Physician will obtain the approval, and 
obtain informed consent from the subject . The rest of the laborat ory tests must be accomplished 
so that a ll screening laboratory tests are completed prior to enrolling a potential subject . If in the 
physician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_360456], the Treating Physician will send 
to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_360457] (if needed ), protocol signature [CONTACT_3264] , informed consent 
signed by [CONTACT_360492] d the Treating Physician, the rest of the completed CRF  pages for 
screening , and the form 1572 completed with the Treating Physician’s information plus the 
Treating Physician’s curriculum vitae . After the PI’s review of the se forms , the investigational 
product will be sent from the drug repository to the Treating P hysician for that subject ’s use.  
 
Treatment will be daily for [ADDRESS_449422] s.

nasal septu m perforation and destructive inflammatory lesions. The latter can obstruct the 
pharynx or larynx and produce remarkable disfigurement. Mucosal disease is occasionally 
reported outside of Latin America, and can be acquired by [CONTACT_360493].  
4.1.2 Diagnosis  
Diagnosi s is routinely made microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_360462], 
scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], or impression smears. Combination of microscopy and culture increases diagnostic 
sensitivity to more than 85%, and culture (or DNA analysis) allows species identif ication. 
Detection of parasite DNA in lesion material by [CONTACT_940] ( PCR ), although 
generally only performed in research settings, is usually most sensitive in the diagnosis of both 
cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis.

3 months is rapid in L. mexicana  (~75%), but slow in L. braziliensis  (about 10%) and L. 
panamensis  infections (about 35%).  
Protocol No.PLB -MILT -201:  Treatment of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with Miltefosine  11 
Version 1, March 6 , 2010   
CL is treated to accelerate cure, reduce scarring especially at cosmetic sites, and to attempt to 
prevent dissemination (eg, mucosal disease) or relapse. Treatment is especially likely to be given 
for persistent lesions (>6 months) or lesions that are located over joints, multiple (5 –10 or more), 
or large (4 –5 cm or more). Classic treatment with parenteral antimony would probably be 
successful in CL in all regions; however, up to [ADDRESS_449427] regimen, 28 days of parenteral antimony, induces cure in  around 75% of cases of mild 
disease (nares only), but advanced disease responds less well. Amphotericin B can be used as 
rescue therapy.  
4.2 Miltefosine  
Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine ) is a phosphatidylcholine analogue. The s tructural 
formula  of milte fosine is :  
 
  
The drug was registered in India  in [ADDRESS_449428] of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]:  Collodial anhydrous silica, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, 
talc, magnesium stearate, gelatin, titanium dioxide, ferric oxide, pu rified water.  
 
Recommended dosage:  Approximately 2.5 mg/kg/day orally for [ADDRESS_449429] s of body weight 30 -45 kg is 100 mg miltefosine (2 capsules Impavido 50 mg). Subject s 
with a body weight greater  than 45 kg receive 150 mg miltef osine daily (3 capsules Impavido 50 
mg).  
 
The capsules should be taken with meals. Subject s taking [ADDRESS_449430] s taking 3 capsules per day 
should take one capsule with the morning meal, the noon meal, and the evening meal.

possibility of interactions with commonly used medicinal products cannot entirely be excluded.  
4.2.6 Use in Specific Population s 
Pregnancy:  There are not adequate data on the use of miltefosine in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Impavido is contraindicated in pregnancy. Women of 
childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and up to 3 -6 months after 
treatment. Vomiting/diarrhea are very common/common side effects of therapy with Impavido 
and can compromise the efficacy of oral contraception. The subject  must be informed by [CONTACT_360495].PLB -MILT -201:  Treatment of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with Miltefosine  [ADDRESS_449434] discu ss the risks associated with this pregnancy.  
 
Nursing mothers:  It is not known whether miltefosine is excreted in the milk. Impavido must not 
be used during lactation; otherwise breast feeding must be stopped.  
 
Geriatric use:  Few subject s of age [ADDRESS_449435] been included in investigations.  
 
Renal impairment:  Subject s with kidney function tests (serum creatinine, BUN) 1.[ADDRESS_449436] s with mild/moderate/se vere abnormalities of kidney function are not available.  
 
Hepatic impairment:  Subject s with liver function tests (AST) 1.[ADDRESS_449437] s with 
mild/moderate/severe a bnormalities of hepatic function are not available.  
4.2.7 Clinical and Non -clinical Pharmacology  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamic Properties  
Miltefosine has a marked direct antileishmanial activity in vitro  and in animal models. However, 
the relevance of specific values (ED50, E D90) to clinical efficacy is unknown. The specific 
mode of action of miltefosine in leishmaniasis is unknown. Among other possible mechanisms, 
miltefosine can inhibit the metabolism of phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_360463].  
 
Nonclinical Pharmacokine tic Studies  
Distribution studies in rats, using radioactively labeled miltefosine, showed highest uptake of 
radioactivity in kidney, liver and spleen. Slow elimination of radioactivity from tissues (half 
lives 8 -16 days) is partially explained by [CONTACT_360496] m of miltefosine and incorporation of the 
labeled choline fragment into physiological lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  
 
No oxidative metabolism by [ADDRESS_449438] that only a very minor part of the administered dose will be excreted as 
the unchanged drug substance. Instead, choline and choline -containing metabolites are the mos t 
likely excretion products.  
 
 
 
 
Protocol No.PLB -MILT -201:  Treatment of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with Miltefosine  [ADDRESS_449439] s with cutaneous leishmaniasis (Dorlo et al., 2008)  
Subject s were administered miltefosine at an average dosage of 1.8 mg/kg/day. Pharmacokinetic 
analysis in this CL subject  population resulted in calculation of two half lives: a first half -life of 
7.[ADDRESS_449440] been performed in mice, rats, dogs and ra bbits. 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar 
to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinic al use are described in the section 
below.  
 
Acute and Chronic Toxicity  
The oral admin istration of miltefosine in rats was associated with regressive and/or progressive 
lesions especially affecting the eyes (retinal degeneration), kidneys (acute resp. chronic 
nephropathy) and organs with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_360464] (atrophy/hyperplasia), as well as 
reproductive organs (atrophy). These alterations were observed after 8 weeks treatment at doses 
of 10 mg/kg/day which led to plasma drug levels of about 52 μg/ml. Juvenile rats were more 
sensitive than adult rats to the miltefosine induced effec ts, especially on eyes and kidneys.  
 
Reproducti ve Toxicity  
Testicular atrophy and impaired fertility were observed in rats following daily oral doses of 8.25 
mg/kg. These findings were reversible within a recovery period of 10 weeks. Reproductive 
toxicity studies in rats during the early embryonic development (up to day 7 of pregnancy) 
indicate an embryotoxic, fetotoxic and teratogenic risk following miltefosine dosages of 1.2 
mg/kg/day and higher. Embryo - and fetotoxic findings were also observed in rabbit s after oral 
administration of miltefosine during the phase of organogenesis (2.4 mg/kg/day and higher).  
 
Mutagenicity/ Carcinogenicity  
Miltefosine tested negative in 6 of 7 of mutagenicity tests (AMES -Salmonella test, DNA -
amplification test, chromosomal ab erration test in vitro , UDS -test in vivo /in vitro , oral mouse -
micronucleus test in vivo ). The V [ADDRESS_449441] s treated with 2.5 mg/kg/day dose for 3 -4 weeks, the same regimen previously used for 
visceral leishmaniasis. The regimen of 2.5 mg/kg/day x [ADDRESS_449442] L. 
braziliensis/L . mexicana . Success in this placebo -controlled study led to continent -wide and 
world -wide use of miltefosine for all forms of leishmaniasis.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose -finding S tudy in L. panamensis  Region in Colombia  (Soto et al. , 2001)  
The cure rate for evaluable subject s in group 1 (50 mg miltefosine/day) was 9/14 (64%). The 
cure rate in group 2 (100 mg miltefosine/day) was 12/18 (67%). The cure rate in subject s given 
150 mg miltefosine/day [2.5 mg/kg/day for these subjects of average weight of 67 kg] was 14/14 
(100%) for subject s treated for 20 days in group 3 and 16/18 (89%) for subject s treated for 28 
days in group 4. Because a larger total dose of drug should be more effective in the general 
population, the dose of a pproximately 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days was adopted based on this 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Placebo C ontrolled Study in L. panamensis  Region in Colombia and in L. 
braziliensis/L . mexicana Region in Guatemala (Soto et al., 2004)  
The obj ective of this study was to demonstrate that miltefosi ne, 2.5 mg/kg/day for [ADDRESS_449444] s >[ADDRESS_449445] L. panamensis  in Colombia 
was 91% ( Table 1 below), in conformity to the results from groups 3 and 4 of the dose -ranging 
study #3092, and statistically higher than the cure rate for placebo (38%).

Version 1, March 6 , 2010  The cure rate was comparable to that historically achieved for pentavalent antimony in 
Colombia. Although the per protocol cure rate in Guatemala (53%) was statis tically higher than 
placebo cure rate (21%), the cure rate against L. braziliensis  in this locale was less than that 
historically achieved for penta valent antimony in Guatemala (> 90%).  
 
Because this study was placebo -controlled, the rate of subjective and laboratory AEs specifically 
due to miltefosine can be determined. The percent of subject s with noteworthy subjective AEs, 
and with abnormal laboratory findings, is shown in Table 2  below:

Protocol No.PLB -MILT -201:  Treatment of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with Miltefosine  18 
Version 1, March 6 , 2010  The final cure rate for miltefo sine (88%) was insignificantly less than the value for pentavalent 
antimony (94%), although antimony was more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_360467] 1 month 
after therapy was higher for antimony (10 0%) than for miltefosine (70%). This comparator -
controlle d study vs. L. braziliensis  in Bolivia shows that the relative lack of efficacy of 
miltefosine for L. braziliensis  in Guatemala may be an outlier.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Single -arm Study on Diffuse C utaneous Leishmaniasis (DCL) in Venezuela (Zerpa 
et al., 2007)  
DCL is essentially untreatable because of an inappropriate immunological response by [CONTACT_360497]. Sixteen subject s with DCL refractory to multiple previous treatments were 
treated with miltefosine, 2.0 –2.5 mg/kg da ily, for long periods of time (75 –218 days).  
 
AEs were very mild. Side -effects were observed in four subject s; two complained of nausea and 
vomiting and reduced the dose without consultation, with improvement in symptoms. One 
subject  presented with dizzin ess on the second day of treatment. On day [ADDRESS_449462] s showed 80 –90% clinical improvement. Nevertheless, suspension of treatment was 
followed by [CONTACT_66867] n ew lesions between [ADDRESS_449463] .  
This study shows that miltefosine treatment can be tolerated for months beyond the normally 
recommended period of 4 weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mucosal Leishmaniasis (Soto  et al., 2007)   
The initial study design was a randomized equivalency study of oral miltefosine ([ADDRESS_449464] s) 
versus standard therapy with pentavalent antimony ([ADDRESS_449465] s).  Due to changes in regional 
standard of care to amphotericin B (45 mg/kg as 1mg/ kg doses for 45 consecutive days), and due 
to initial positive response rates in the miltefosine group, subject s refused to be treated with 
antimony or to be randomized to the amphotericin B arm of the study. Therefore, the final study 
design became an eva luation of one cohort of [ADDRESS_449466] s who received miltefosine (2.5 
mg/kg/day for 28 days). An almost contemporary group of [ADDRESS_449467] s who received 
amphotericin B (45 mg/kg) as miltefosine treatment was getting organized was evaluated as a 
post hoc compari son group.  
 
Miltefosine was well tolerated. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were each reported by 8 –[ADDRESS_449468] epi[INVESTIGATOR_360468] 1; one epi[INVESTIGATOR_360469] 3. Most epi[INVESTIGATOR_360470] 1 –2 
days and a few lasted 3 –4 days. Mean values of liver function tests and kidney function tests did 
not change; a few subject s had values that were slightly above the upper limit of normal after 
treatment.  
 
Of the [ADDRESS_449469] s in the 
amphotericin B gro up were evaluable. Fifty -one (71%) of the [ADDRESS_449470] s 
were “cured” by [CONTACT_360498] >90% diminution in the mucosal severity score with [ADDRESS_449471] all (49 [96%]) of these subject s demonstrated complete resolutio n of their 
Protocol No.PLB -MILT -201:  Treatment of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with Miltefosine  [ADDRESS_449472] s who had “mild” disease (i.e., affecting only the 
nasal skin and nasal mucosa) was 83%. The cure rate for the [ADDRESS_449473] s who had more extensive 
disease (involving the palate, pharynx, and larynx)  was 58%.  
 
The cure rate for the amphotericin B group (45 mg/kg over 90 days) was 7 (50%) of 14.  
Since the historic cure rate for treatment of ML in neighboring Peru varies between 10% and 
75%, this study suggests that miltefosine is approximately as effe ctive as standard treatment with 
antimony, and with amphotericin B, for Andean mucosal disease.  Before -and-after photographs 
of one subject  from this study with involvement of the external nares ( Figure 1 ), illustrates the 
clinical improvement in skin and mucosa consequent to successful miltefosine therapy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Summary  
The cure rate for CL treated with miltefosine (2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days) is superior to placebo 
and, except in one region, comparable to standard therapy with antimony. This regimen of 
miltefosine also gives cure rates for ML comparable to historic values for antimony, and 
provides remarkable clinical improvement for DCL subject s. 
   
Subject s with CL or ML are systemically normal. For these hosts, laboratory abnormalities due 
to milte fosine treatment consist of the common occurrence of low grade elevations in serum 
creatinine, and the uncommon occurrence of higher -grade elevations, both of which are 
reversible. The symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and perhaps motion sickness /headache  are also 
common.  
  
Miltefosine has a favorable therapeutic index for CL and ML, with the additional advantage of 
being orally administrable. No other accepted antileishmanial agent, whether an investigational 
agent in the [LOCATION_002] or registered agent else where, is orally administrable.

Compliance with drug administration will be assessed by [CONTACT_360503][INVESTIGATOR_692].  
8.6 Treatment M odifications and Study Discontinuation  
Dose reduction due to AEs: A subject  who does not tolerate the planne d dosage will go off -
treatment. N o dose reduction is planned.  
 
Discontinuation of study treatment and withdrawal from protocol for other reasons:   A subject 
may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without penalty, if he or she wishes 
to do so.  The Treating Physician may withdraw a subject if continuing participation is believed 
to be harmful to the subject’s well -being or in the event of protocol violations, non -compliance, 
positive pregnancy test during active treatment, serious intercurrent illness, or app arent failure of 
efficacy. The sponsor, PI, and IRB have the right to discontinue the investigation at any time.  
 
In the event that the subject withdraws from the study before the completion of the 28 days of 
treatment, s/he will be asked to come to the cl inic for a final assessment including AEs, lesion 
measurements, vital signs, blood creatinine, and concomitant medication use.  
 
If the subject withdraws during the follow -up period, s/he will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], if possible, and 
requested to come to the clinic for lesion measurements.  
 
If possible, positive pregnancy should be followed to the end of the pregnancy.  
8.7 Concomitant Therapy  
All concomitant medications and any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (prescribed and non -prescribed) must be recorded 
on the CRF . Any change during the  study should be documented as well. Symptomatic treatment 
of side effects and treatment of concomitant diseases not associated with leishmaniasis is 
permitted.  Treatment with other agents known or likely to be active against Leishmania 
(pentavalent antimo ny, amphotericin B, paromomycin,  imidazoles, local heat or cold therapy)  is 
not permitted .

is removed fr om the protocol for any reason ( decision that the subject  has failed treatment, 
inability of the subject  to comply with the protocol conditions, or desire of the subject , physician, 
Sponsor, or IRB) , the subject  may be treated with another antileishmanial agent off -protocol at 
the discreti on of the treating physician.

Treating Physician will complete the screening CRF pages for demographics, medical history, 
leishmaniasis history, clinical laboratory results that are availabl e, and identification of 
Leishmania  in the lesion, and send  (mail or fax)  these CRF pages  to the PI. If after PI [INVESTIGATOR_345], the 
subject is potentially eligible for the protocol, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_360472], the miltefosine 
package insert, the informed conse nt form , and the FDA form [ADDRESS_449490] already been approved by a “central” IRB, if there is an 
additional need to have the Treating Physician’s local IRB approve the protocol, the Treating 
Physician will  obtain the approval, and obtain informed consent from the subject. The rest of the 
laboratory tests must be accomplished so that all screening laboratory tests are completed prior to 
enrolling a potential subject. If in the physician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_360473], the Treating Physician will send  the local IRB signature [CONTACT_3264] (if needed), protocol 
signature [CONTACT_3264], informed consent signed by [CONTACT_360504], the rest 
completed CRF pages for screening data to  the PI , and the form 1572 completed with the 
Treating Physician’s information plus his/her curriculum vitae . After the PI’s review of the se 
documents , the investigational product will be sent from the drug repository to the Treating 
Physician for that sub ject’s use.  
 
Note that because the tests needed to satisfy the entrance criteria of medical history, 
leishmaniasis history, and identification of Leishmania in the lesion are standard of care for this 
disease, the tests can be performed prior to signing th e consent form for this protocol. This 
procedural order [evaluate certain entrance criteria, then achieve local IRB approval if needed 
and signing of consent, then evaluate the rest of the entrance criteria] is chosen so that subject s 
do not undergo excess  procedures and expectations  if the subject  ultimately is unlikely to be 
able to enroll in the protocol.

this protocol.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Examination of Cutaneous L esions  
Ulcerated CL lesions will be measured in mm for the longest diameter and perpendicular width 
of ulceration. Non -ulcerated lesions will be measured for length and width of the raised area of 
the lesion. Lesion area = Length x Width. Lymph nodes in the drainage path of the cutan eous 
lesion will be noted and measured.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Examination of M ucosa  
For CL subject s, the Treating Physician will examine the nasal and oral mucosa of each subject.  
10.1.2  Definitions of Lesion Response  
Healed:   100% reduction in lesion area [lesion size = 0x0 mm2] 
Improved:   50% - 99% reduction in lesion area  
No change:  49% enlargement to 49% reduction in lesion area  
Worse:   >50% enlargement of lesion area at or after the end of therapy.  
Relapsed:  Substantial enlargement of lesion after initial improvement or healing.  
 
10.1.3  Definition of Clinical Responses  
Lesion Cure:   Lesion is healed at the M onth 7  visit.  
Lesion Failure:  Each lesion will be considered a failure if it does not meet the criteria for cure 
(missing data will be considered failures). The intended response to t herapy is a progressive 
diminution in lesion size and no relaps e. Lesion failure therefore is defined as clinically worse at 
the end of ther apy or thereafter, OR does not i mprove at the Week 6  or Month 3 visit, OR is not 
healed at the  Month 7  visit, OR rel apses.  
 
NOTE: Parasitological responses can assist the clinician in evaluating the clinical response of the 
lesion. If the Treating Physician has parasitologically re -investigated a slowly responding lesion 
Protocol No.PLB -MILT -201:  Treatment of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with Miltefosine  [ADDRESS_449504]  Cure:  All lesions cured  by [CONTACT_360506] [ADDRESS_449505]  Failure:   Not all lesions clinically cure d, or a new lesion due to Leishmania . 
 
Primary endpoint(s) :  The co -primary endpoints are the subject  cure rate for the  modified 
intent ion-to-treat ( mITT ) and evaluable populations .  
10.[ADDRESS_449506] will examine the nasal and oral mucosa. Each 
of 5 possible sites (nasal skin, nasal mucosa, palate, pharynx, and larynx) will be evaluated for 4 
possible signs of disease (erythema, edema, infiltration, and erosion) and graded on a 0 -3 scale: 0 
= no disease, 1 = mild disease, 2 = moderate disease, 3 = severe disease.  If possible, the ENT 
specialist who first examined the subject  will re -evaluate the or al-nasal mucosa at each follow -up 
visit for the subject  
10.2.2  Clinical Parameter and D efini tion of C linical Responses  
Clinical response will be measured will be a composite score, the mucosal severity score (MSS). 
The MSS is the sum of the severity scores for ea ch clinical sign at each clinical site  of disease . 
The Maximum MSS is 60: grade 3 severity for each of 4 possible signs at each of the 5 possible 
sites.  
 
Healed:   MSS that is 0 in absolute value [equals 0% of the entrance MSS score].  
Improved:   MSS that i s 1% -25% of the entrance MSS score.  
Non-substantial Change:   MSS that is 26% -99% of the entrance MSS score.  
Worse:   MSS >100% of the entrance MSS score.  
Relapse:   MSS substantially increases after initially improving or becoming 0.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_449507]  cure:   Clinical cure is lesion is healed.  
Subject  failure:   Leasion did not heal. NOTE: The intended response to therapy is a progressive 
diminution in signs and symptoms and no relapse. Subject  failure is  defined as clinically worse at 
the Week 6 visit or thereafter, OR does not improve at the Month 3 or month 7  visits, OR is not 
healed at the Month 13 visit, OR relapses.   
 
Primary endpoint(s) :   The primary endpoints are the clinical cure rates for the mITT and 
evaluable population.  
Protocol No.PLB -MILT -201:  Treatment of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with Miltefosine  [ADDRESS_449508] from the protocol for lack of 
efficacy and to initiate rescue (alternative) therapy for ML or CL.  
 
For CL, the basis for lack of efficacy will generally be failure of at least one lesion:  lesion has  
worse ned at the end of therapy or thereafter, OR does not Improve at the Week 6 or Month 3 
visit, OR is not healed at the Month 7 visit, OR relapses, or a new lesion.  
 
For ML, the basis for lack of efficacy will generally be failure:  clinically worse (by [CONTACT_360507]) 
at the Week 6 visit of or thereafter, OR does not improve at the Month 3 or Month 6 visit, OR is 
not healed at the Month 13 visit, OR relapses.

Version 1, March 6 , 2010  11 SAFETY/ADVERSE EVENT S 
11.1 Assessment Methods  
11.1.1  Symptoms  
Medic al history:  At screening, during treatment, and during follow up, subjects will be asked 
general questions about their well being and specific questions about gastrointestinal distress 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). If a medically substantial problem is rep orted, it should be reported 
to the Treating Physician immediately.   
11.1.2  Signs  
At screening, a physical exam of the head, eyes, ears, cardiovascular system, lungs, abdomen 
(liver/spleen), extremities, skin, lymphatic system, neuropsychiatric mental status and  
sensory/motor status, musculoskeletal system and general appearance will be performed. Height 
and weight will be recorded. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature) will be 
recorded. During treatment and follow up, a targeted physical exam wil l be performed if 
prompted by [CONTACT_120937] ’s appearance. Vital signs will be recorded.  
11.1.3  Laboratory Assessments  
Venous blood will be collected during screening for measurement of hematology parameters to 
be reported [white blood cells (WBC), n eutrophil count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet 
count] and chemistry parameters including glucose, sodium, potassium, creatinine, ALT , and 
bilirubin.  These baseline values will be used to determine if the subject  has a concomitant 
medical condition.  
 
On nominal days [ADDRESS_449509] and creatinine only. On 
follow up visits at Month 3, Month 7, and Month 13 , blood will again be collected for ALT  and 
creatinine if on the previous sample the ALT  value was above the upp er limit of normal , or if the 
creatinine clearance was abnormal. Serum creatinine levels will be used to calculate creatinine 
clearance (CrCl) according to the Cockroft -Gault formula as follows:  
 
Males   CrCl (mL/min) =    [140 – age (years) x body weight (k g)]   
      (72) x (serum creatinine [mg/dL])  
 
Females  CrCl (mL/min) =   0.85 x [140 – age (years) x body weight (kg)]  
(72) x (serum creatinine [mg/dL])  
11.1.[ADDRESS_449510] that  
measures human β -chorionic gonadotropin will be used during screening, at the end of treatment, 
and during follow up.  
11.1.5  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
An ECG  will be taken during screening  to evaluate if the subject  has a baseline medical 
condition.  
Protocol No.PLB -MILT -201:  Treatment of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with Miltefosine  [ADDRESS_449511], as well as 
clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examination or laboratory evaluation.   
 
A new illness, symptom, sign , or clinically significant clinical laboratory abnormality  is 
considered an AE. A  worsening of a  pre-existing condition  or abnormality is also considered an 
AE. The appearance of scars at healed lesion sites will not be reported as an AE.  Stable chronic 
conditions which are present prior to clinical trial entry and do not worsen are not considered 
AEs.  
11.3 Severity Definitions  
Subjective AEs will be graded according to the definitions provided below:  
 
Grade 1:    Mild symptoms invoking a minimum degree of discomfort that are easily tolerated.  
 
Grade 2:    Moderate symptoms that result in a reduction in nor mal daily activity, but is not 
totally incapacitating. This may or may not require medical intervention.  
 
Grade 3:    Severe symptoms that may be totally incapacitating or result in marked reduction in 
normal daily activity. Medical intervention is usually required.  
 
Grade 4:    Potentially life -threatening event that requires emergency intervention or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
  
Physical examination AEs and laboratory AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer 
Institute ’s CTC  for AEs. For the expected AEs of  vomiting, diarrhea, ALT  elevation, and 
creatinine elevation, the Common Terminology Criteria are:  
 
Analyte  Grade 1  Grade 2  Grade 3  Grade 4  
ALT  elevated  >ULN – 2.[ADDRESS_449512]  >2.5 – 5.[ADDRESS_449513]  >5.0 – 20.[ADDRESS_449514]  >20.[ADDRESS_449515]  
Creatinine  >ULN - 1.[ADDRESS_449516]  >1.[ADDRESS_449517]  >3.[ADDRESS_449518]  >6.[ADDRESS_449519] ools 
per day  
 
The Common Terminology Criteria for unanticipated AEs will be accessed if needed.  
 
Protocol No.PLB -MILT -201:  Treatment of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with Miltefosine  [ADDRESS_449520]  and an AE at the time of reporting. Causality 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_360508].  
 
Definitions are:  
  
Unrelated:    There is no temporal relationship between the event and the administration 
of the investigational  product  or the event is clearly due to the subject’s 
medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.  
 
Unlikely:   There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product  but there is 
another more likely cause of the event.  
 
Possibly Related:    There is some temporal relationship between the event and the 
administration of the investigational product  and the event is unlikely to 
be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Probably Related:    The temporal relationship between th e event and the administration of the 
investigational product  is compelling, and the subject’s medical condition 
and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_360474].  
 
Definitely Related:    The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the medication or follows a known or suspected response pattern to the 
medication.  
 
The categories of Definitely Related, P robably Related, and Possibly Re lated will be considered 
investigational product related with regards to summary statistics.  
11.[ADDRESS_449521]  can be:  
1. none  
2. permanently discontinued  
 
Also, outcomes will be recorded  as:  
1. resolved  
2. resolved with sequelae  
3. ongoing  
4. required treatment  
5. unknown  
11.[ADDRESS_449522]  is taken  on Day 1 through t he end of follow up at Month 7 for CL  or 
Month 13 for ML. For the period betwee n Study Day 1 and Study Week 6 (2 weeks after the end 
of therapy), all AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to the investigational product  are to 
Protocol No.PLB -MILT -201:  Treatment of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with Miltefosine  36 
Version 1, March 6 , 2010  be recorded on the CRF.  For the period Week 6 to Month 7 for CL, or Month 13 for ML, only 
AEs requir ing medical attention are to be recorded on the CRF.  
 
Whenever possible, symptoms should be grouped as a single syndrome or diagnosis. The 
Treating Physician should specify the date of onset, maximum severity grade, his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_360475] n the AE and the administration of the investigational product  (causality), 
outcomes including corrective therapy given (if applicable). Clinically significant AEs ongoing 
at the last follow up visit will be followed to resolution or stabilized including t he administration 
of any concomitant medications.  
11.7 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Each AE or reaction will be classified by [CONTACT_360509] -serious. Based 
on the seriousness of the AE or reaction appropriate reporting procedures will b e followed.  
An SAE is defined as:  
 
 results in death;  
 is life -threatening;  (NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" 
refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to an eve nt which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.)  
 requires in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
In addition, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug reaction, when based on appropriate 
medical judgment that may jeopardize the subject and may require  medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. For this protocol, 
becoming pregnant between Study Day [ADDRESS_449523] be submitted by [CONTACT_360510] . 
  
The Data Management Center will prepare a na rrative or a MedWatch (FDA Form 3500 A) if the 
SAE meets the criteria for expedited reporting for an SAE.

Version 1, March 6 , 2010  12  ANALYTICAL PLAN  
12.1 Sample Size  
As the s tudy is not designed to compare the efficacy of the two treatments, there is no formal 
sample size calculation.  
12.2 Analytic al Populations  
mITT Population:   The mITT population includes all subjects who received any administration 
of an investigational produ ct.   
 
Evaluable Population:   The evaluable population will include all subjects who received daily 
doses of investigational product for at least [ADDRESS_449524] s with CL and ML.  
 
Safety Population:   The safety population includes all subjects who received any adminis tration 
of investigational product.  
12.3 General A nalytical Procedures  
Descriptive statistics will be used to present study data. Continuous variables will be presented 
as number of observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum 
values. Categorical variables will be presented as counts and percentages.  
12.[ADDRESS_449525] a nd summaries of compliance with scheduled treatments will be provided,  including 
total exposure (number of days and total dose) to investigational product .  
12.[ADDRESS_449526] s who cure or fail will be calculated. This data will be presented for the mITT and 
evaluable pop ulations.  
Protocol No.PLB -MILT -201:  Treatment of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with Miltefosine  [ADDRESS_449527] ’s estimate of his/her  lesion response may be obtained from the subject  by [CONTACT_756], 
and will be noted as obtained in that manner. Such data is not defined as missing. For such data, 
the Treating Physician and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_360476] ’s estimate is likely to b e 
reliable. In a single -group non -comparative study such as this one, errors in interpretation will 
only apply to miltefosine subject s and will not be corrected by [CONTACT_360511] a 
comparator group. Therefore, it is important for subject , physici an, and Investigator to avoid two 
potential errors:  1) erroneously viewing a lesion as healed when in fact it is still present, 2) 
erroneously viewing a lesion as failed because a subject  does not show up for clinic, when in fact 
the lesion has healed and  the subject  does not want to spend time coming to clinic.

Dictionary of Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) by [CONTACT_20526] a preferred term and will be grouped 
by [CONTACT_57501], organ, and class (SOC) designation. Listings of each individual AE including start 
date, stop date, severity, relationship, duration, and outcome will be provided.

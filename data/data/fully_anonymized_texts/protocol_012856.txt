1.0 Objectives
 
Primary Objective(s) / Endpoint(s)
In this study, we will explore the safety and clinical efficacy of caboz antinib combined 
with androgen ablation in men with newl y diagnosed androgen-dependent pr ostate cancer 
based on progression free survival. The primary end points are:
1.To assess the tolerance and safety of cabozantinib in combination with a ndrogen 
ablation in this patient group.
2.To estimate the time to castrate-resistant progression defined by [CONTACT_31617] o f the following: 
(a) radiographic progression (using RECIST 1.1 for visceral disease a nd PCWG2 for 
Bone Scans), (b) receipt of additional anti-cancer therapy, or (c) cl inical progression 
warranting discontinuation from the study as judged by [CONTACT_74079].
3.To collect and bank blood and tissue specimens for future hypothesis-gen erating 
studies.
 
Secondary Objective(s) / Endpoint(s)Secondary endpoints will include:
1.   Overall Survival
2.   Radiologic responses3.   Biomarker modulation (for example PSA, CTC, serum cytokine profi les, bone specific 
alkaline phosphatase, uri ne n-telopeptides)
4.   Tumor pharmacodynamic measures (molecular-pathologic analysis o f c-Met/VEGFR
signaling pathways using metastatic tissue samples).
 
 
2.0 Background
Cabozantinib (XL184) is a novel small molecule inhibitor of multiple re ceptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) that promote tumor cell proliferation and/or angiogenes is including RET, 
MET, VEGFR2/KDR, and KIT. In a recently reported phase II randomized d iscontinuation 
study of cabozantinib in patients with advanced solid tumors, a high prop ortion of patients 
with mCRPC achieved clinically sign ificant responses while on therapy characterized by 
[CONTACT_798752], reduc tions in lymphadenopathy, reductions in pain, a nd improvement in 
bone scans(1). These results are attributed to the fact that overexpress ion of MET (and/or its
ligand HGF) correlates with prosta te cancer progression and the develo pment of metastasis
(2-4). Based on these encouraging results, a multi-center, non-random ized expansion (NRE)
cohort for patients with m CRPC has been initiated. We now propose to study the potential
safety and benefit of cabozantinib in patients with metastatic andro gen-dependent
prostate cancer.
 
The front-line paradigm for the treatment of metastatic androgen-depe ndent prostate cancer 
remains disruption of androgen receptor signaling (5). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_798738], 
however, all patients eventually dev elop castrate-resistant progressi on, a disease state 
responsible for 32,[ADDRESS_1101746] ye ar in the [LOCATION_002] (6, 7). Re cent advances in
tumor biology have elucidated growth-promoting pathways that contribut e to the 
development of castrate-resistant disease. Importantly, these oncoge nic pathways provide 
crosstalk between the “epi[INVESTIGATOR_752402]” and the “stromal compart ment” (8). For

example, stromal elements within bone – the most frequent organ site for p rostate cancer 
metastases - promote the evolution of castrate-resistant disease. The r ationale to disrupt this 
crosstalk has led to the discovery of drugs that target tumor stromal el ements in additional to
the cancer epi[INVESTIGATOR_1231] (9).
 
There is increasing evidence from data derived from primary human tumors a ndpre- clinical
models that Met is a critical oncogenic pathway that contributes to the evo lution of castrate-
resistant disease. For example, Met is upregulated by [CONTACT_798753]-
proliferative effect of Met inhibitors is greater in castrate-resistant versus androgen-
dependent cell lines (10, 11). Further more, the anti-tumor effect of Me t inhibitors is greatly 
enhanced when combined with androgen ablation therapy in pre-clinical mo dels (11). These
results suggest the hypothesis that c ombining Met inhibition with andro gen ablation will
prevent (or delay) the development of castrate-resistant disease.
 
In the present study, we will explore this hypothesis by [CONTACT_798754], androgen-depend ent metastatic 
disease. Data from our own institution suggest that the median time to pr ogression (as 
defined by [CONTACT_798755]-resistant disease) in unselect ed patients treated with 
androgen ablation alone is approxima tely 24 months. However, in a subset  of patients with 
“high-volume” disease (>3 bone lesions and/or visceral metastases), the median time to 
progression is 11.2 months (12).

4.0 Drug Information
 
4.1 Cabozantinib
 
Cabozantinib (XL184) is a new chemical entity that inhibits multiple RT Ks with 
growth-promoting and angiogenic properties. The primary targets of cab ozantinib
are RET, MET, VEGFR2/KDR, and KIT (Table 1).

RET 3.8
MET 1.8
VEGFR2/KDR 0.035

ICSO, concentration required for 50 %target inhibition.
Treatment with cabozantinib shows rapid effects on the tumor endotheli um,
resulting in breakdown of the vasculature beginning 24 hours after ad ministration
of cabozantinib, thus suggesting potent anti-angiogenic effects of ca bozantinib.
These effects translate into significant tumor growth inhibition afte r cabozantinib
treatment in multiple tumor models including human medullary thyroid ca ncer
(MTC), human breast cancer, human lung carcinoma, and rat glioblastoma. Overall,
the data generated in vivo demonstrate that the target profile of cabozan tinib
translates to potent anti-angiogenic activity and potent anti-tumor ef ficacy.

from Study XL184-203 as of the cutoff date of 01 March 2011 for the  open-label l2-week Lead-In 
Stage; for Study XL184-203 only, an updated safety analysis based  on data from 490 subjects 
(Lead-In Stage) as of the cutoff date of 09 May 2011 was also co nducted for the RDT Cohorts of 
the study (see Section 5.1.7 for description of cohorts), and the  safety profile was not significantly 
changed from the [ADDRESS_1101755] bee n
studied in open-label clinical trials with cabozantinib, including tre atment with
cabozantinib as a single agent, as well as cabozantinib in combinatio n with
temozolomide and radiation therapy , and cabozantinib in combination wi th
erlotinib.
 
4.1.3 Adverse Events
The general adverse event profile of  cabozantinib includes GI symptoms (such as 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), fatigue, anorexia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, skin rash, elevated ALT and AST, i ncreased
pancreatic enzymes with rare cases of  pancreatitis, as well as side e ffects
associated with inhibition of VEGF signaling such as thrombotic event s( e g ,
pulmonary embolism [PE] and deep vein thrombosis [DVT]), hypertension,proteinuria, hemorrhagic events, and rare cases of gastrointestinal [G I]
perforation and rectal/perirectal abscess. Arterial thromboembolism (transient
ischemic attack [TIA], myocardial infarction [MI]) have been reported rarely.
 
4.1.4 Serious Adverse Events
Out of all 561 subjects enrolled in open-label clinical trials with cab ozantinib 
(XL184), 224 subjects (40%) experienced one or more SAEs, and 96 sub jects 
experienced one or more SAE that was assessed to be related to treatment with
cabozantinib. This total includes two late-breaking cases (one case of abdominal
distension and failure to thrive in Study XL184-201 and one fatal respir atory
failure in Study XL184-203) that were reported after the data cut- off. A cross 
all open-label studies, the most comm only reported events, regardless o f 
relationship to cabozantinib, we re PE (in 21 subjects), convulsion (in 1 7
subjects), DVT (in 13 subjects), pneumonia (in 13 subjects), vomitin g( i n1 2  
subjects), abdominal pain (in 11 subjects), diarrhea (in 11 subjects), nausea (in
11 subjects), dehydration (in 10 subjects), and dyspnea (in eight subje cts). The
most commonly reported events across all open-label studies that were a ssessed
as drug-related were PE (in 14 subjects), diarrhea (in nine subjects), DVT (in
seven subjects), nausea (in seven subj ects), hypertension (in five subj ects),
thrombocytopenia (in five subjects), dehydration (in four subjects), vomiting (in
four subjects), abdominal pain (in thr ee subjects), and perirectal abs cess (in

4.1.6 Clinical Pharmacokinetics
In Exelixis study XL184-001, in which doses are expressed in terms of t heir L-
malate salt weight (see Appendix J f or freebase weight equivalents), a
preliminary PK analysis has been performed for 74 subjects. The cut-o ff date for 
the data used for this PK analys is is 02 September 2008. Pharmacokine tic 
results from Cohorts 1-9 (0.08-11.52 mg/kg, Intermittent 5&9, PIB) sho w that 
systemic exposure (Cmax and area under the plasma drug concentration tim e
curve from time [ADDRESS_1101757] quantifiable concentration following dosin g 
[AUC0-last]) values increased gene rally dose-proportionally with inc reasing 
cabozantinib dose. Terminal phase ha lf-life (t1/2, z) values were long ( range:
59.1 to 136 hours). Data from Cohorts 10-13 (175 mg qd PIB; 265 mg qd P IB;
175 mg qd capsule; 250 mg qd capsule) and Cohort 99 (175 mg qd capsule)  
show that drug accumulation (base d on Cmax and AUC0-24 values) at stea dy-
state after daily dosing is approximately 4- to 6-fold.
 
In addition, exposure values from PIB (Cohorts 10) or Capsule (Cohort s 12 
and 99) are compared in Table 2. The data show that cabozantinib exposure  
(AUC) values from capsule cohorts are about 2.0 fold greater than those 
observed in the respective PIB cohort.

Data from 18 subjects in XL184-201 (GB M) are available as of 26 Janua ry 2009.
The data show that pre-dose concentration values at C1D15 are consiste nt with
those reported in the Phase 1 s etting: 1800 ± 868 ng/mL (n =18) versus  1920 ±
751 ng/mL (n = 16). In addition, the p eak to trough concentration ratio s at steady-

state are moderate, with a value approximately equal to unity.
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib has not been studied in subje cts 
receiving a capsule dose of 125 mg (salt weight) qd, but simulated expo sure 
values are expected to be about 70% of those from 175 mg (salt weight). Based on the simulated data, exposure values from the 125-mg (salt weight ) 
cohort or the 175-mg (salt weight) cohort are statistically different: 9 5% 
confidence interval for AUC values are [ZIP_CODE] ± 1022 vs. [ZIP_CODE] ± 1730ng×h/mL, respectively. In addition, the simulated steady-state averag e 
concentration from cabozantinib at 125 mg (salt weight) is 1100 ng/mL.
4.1.7 Comparative Bioavailability Stu dy of Cabozantinib Tablet and Cap sule
Formulations in Healthy Adult Subjects (Study XL184-005)
 
Study XL184-[ADDRESS_1101758] (100 mg cabozantinib, do sed as one
100-mg tablet) or Reference (100 m g cabozantinib, dosed as two 50-m g
capsules), according to a randomization scheme. Each dosing was admini stered
under fasting conditions, and blood samples were collected up to [ADDRESS_1101759] after each treatment to assess plasma cabozanti nib PK.
Based on the preliminary PK data from 23 subjects who completed both treatments, after a single oral dose of cabozantinib at 100 mg, the termin al- phase
half-life (t
1/2, z) of cabozantinib appeared to be s imilar for both tablet and capsule
formulations, with approximately mean values of 110 hours. The media nt i m et o
the maximum plasma concentration (tmax)was [ADDRESS_1101760] variabi lity for the
maximum plasma concentration (C max) and the area under the plasma drug 
concentration time curve (AUC) va lues were observed for both formulatio ns
(coefficient of variation [CV]% C max: 51% for the tablet f ormulation, 61% for 
the capsule formulation; CV% for the AUC from time zero to the last
quantifiable timepoi nt or to infinity [AUC 0-lastor AUC 0-inf]: 40-43% for the tablet
formulation, 43% for the capsule fo rmulation.) The geometric mean C maxof the
tablet formulation was approximate ly 39% higher than the value observ ed for the
capsule formulation. The geometric mean AUC 0-lastand AUC 0-infvalues for the
tablet formulation were also higher (15% and 19%, respectively) than th ose
observed for the capsule formulation. However, due to the high within-formulation variability observed, no
statistical difference in exposure between the
two formulations was apparent.
4.1.[ADDRESS_1101761] of Food on the Bioavailab ility of Cabozantinib in Health y Adult Subjects
(Study XL184-004)
 
Study XL184-[ADDRESS_1101762] ([ADDRESS_1101763]) or 
Reference (175 mg cabozantinib, dosed as one 100-mg capsule and three 25 -
mg capsules under fasting conditions). Blood samples were collected up t o [ADDRESS_1101764] afte r each treatment to assess plasm a
cabozantinib pharmacokinetics.
 
Based on the preliminary PK data from 46 subjects who completed both treatments, a high-fat meal did not appear to alter the terminal t
1/2, zof 
cabozantinib [mean t 1/2, z: 131 hours (fed) vs 128 hours (fasted)]. The high-fat 
meal significantly increased the median t maxto 6 hours from 4 hours (fasted). The
high-fat meal also significantly increased both the cabozantinib C maxand AUC 
values by 39% and 56%, respectivel y. The geometric mean ratio of C max 
fed/fasted was 1.39 (90% CI: 1.16-1.67) , and the geometric mean ratio of AUC 0-
lastfed/fasted was 1.56 (90% CI: 1.34-1.80). Based on this result, cabo zantinib
should be taken on an empty stomach (fasting is required 2 hours before a nd 1
hour after each cabozantinib dose).

7.0     Dose Modifications/Toxicity Management
 
Patients will be treated until development of castration-resistant dis ease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal of consent.
 
Subjects will be monitored closely for AEs and instructed to notify thei r physician and/or 
study nurse immediately for any and all toxicities. Subjects experienc ing one or more AEs 
due to the study treatment may require a dosing delay, or reduction(s), in their dose in
order to continue with study treatment. Assessment of causality (chron ology, confounding
factors such as disease, concomitant medications, diagnostic tests, and previous
experience with the study treatment) should be conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a s ub-investigator,
before a decision is made to modify the dose or to hold dosing temporaril y.
 
Permissible dose reductions are outlined in Table 3. Patients who cann ot tolerate [ADDRESS_1101772] 
effective dose will require brie f interruptions (e.g. 1 to 3 da ys per week) in the daily 
dosing of cabozantinib rather than a dose reduction. These inte rruptions are permissible at 
the discretion of the treating  physician and will be recorded f or data monitoring, reporting, 
and publication.
 
 
7.1 Warnings, Precautions, and Ma nagement of Anticipated Events
The general adverse event profile of  cabozantinib includes GI symptoms (such as nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea), fatigue, anorexia, palmar-plantar erythrodys esthesia (PPE) 
syndrome, skin rash, elevated ALT and AST, increased pancreatic enzyme s with rare
cases of  pancreatitis, as well as side effects associated with inhibi tion of VEGF signaling
such as thrombotic events (eg, pulmonary embolism [PE] and deep vein t hrombosis
[DVT]), hypertension, proteinuria, hemorrhagic events, and rare cases of gastrointestinal
Protocol 2012-0252

Page 18
[GI] perforation and rectal/perirectal abscess. Arterial thromboem bolism (transient
ischemic attack [TIA], myocardial infarction [MI]) have been reporte dr a r e l y .
 
 
7.1.1 Management of Adverse Events
 
 
In the absence of an unacceptable cabozantinib-related toxicity and/o r clinical signs of 
disease progression, subjects may con tinue treatment at the discretion of the 
investigator. Subjects must be instructed to notify their physician imme diately for any
and all toxicities.
 
Guidelines for the management of AEs (i.e. dose interruptions and dos e reductions) are
presented in the next sections. Each dose reduction of cabozantinib sho uld be to one
dose level lower that the current dose. If study treatment of cabozanti nib is restarted
after being withheld or interrupted, t he subject should be instructed not to make up the
missed doses of cabozantinib.
 
The reason for treatment delay and reduced dose must be recorded in the me dical 
record.  Any dose interruption and/or treatment delay of > 4 weeks  will result in the
removal from study treatment.
Dosing may need to be interrupted for AEs considered not related to cabo zantinib if
this is clinically indicated or if causality is initially uncertain. Stu dy treatment may be
resumed at the same dose (or a lower dose per investigator judgment) if th eA E
is determined not to be related to cabozantinib once the investigator dete rmines that 
retreatment is clinically appropria te and the subject meets the protocol re-treatment 
criteria.

7.1.3 Diarrhea, Nausea, Vomiting, Stomatitis, and Mucositis
Diarrhea
Subjects should be instructed to notif y their physician and/or study nurs e 
immediately at the first signs of poorly formed or loose stool or an inc reased 
frequency of bowel movements. Administration of antidiarrheal agents is 
recommended at the first sign of diarrhea as initial management. Lopera mide is 
recommended as standard first line therapy. Alternatively, diphenoxyl ate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_342844]. Additional agents to consider in subjects with diarrhea that is refractory
to the above include deodorized tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_342845]. Some su bjects
may require concomitant therapy with loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropi [INVESTIGATOR_050], and
deodorized tincture of opi[INVESTIGATOR_342846]. When combination ther apy with
antidiarrheal agents does not control the diarrhea to tolerable levels, a dose reduction
and/or dose interruption of cabozantinib should be implemented as des cribed in
Table 3. In addition, general supportive measures should be implement ed including
continuous oral hydration, correction of fluid and electrolyte abnorm alities, small
frequent meals, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151947]- containing products, high fat mea ls and
alcohol.
 
Nausea and Vomiting
Anti-emetic agents along with supportiv e care are recommended as clinic ally 
appropriate at the first sign of naus ea and vomiting. A dose reductions and/or dose 
interruption of cabozantinib may be required as described in Table 3 if a ntiemetic 
treatment and/or prophylaxis alone is not adequate.
 
Agents classified as having a high therapeutic index (such as 5-HT3 re ceptor 
antagonists, or NK-1 receptor anta gonists) per ASCO or MASCC/ESMO g uidelines 
for anti-emetics in oncology or dexamethasone are recommended. Cautio ni s  
recommended with the use of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_798742] a s cabozantinib
exposure may be affected by [CONTACT_798763] [INVESTIGATOR_798743] 2012-[ADDRESS_1101778] local treatments such as non- traumatic clean sing, and oral
rinses (eg, with a weak solution of salt and baking soda) should be maint ained. The
oral cavity should be rinsed and wipe d after meals, and dentures should be c leaned
and brushed often to remove plaque . Local treatment should be institute da tt h e
earliest onset of symptoms. When stomatitis interferes with adequate n utrition and
local therapy is not adequately effective, dose reduction or temporar y withholding of 
cabozantinib should be considered.
 
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1101779] also been observed during treatment wi th 
cabozantinib. In general, it is recommended that subjects with elevatio no f  A L T ,  A S T ,  
and/or bilirubin have more frequent laboratory monitoring of these parameters. If
possible, hepatotoxic concomitant medications and alcohol should be discontinued in
subjects who develop elevated transaminases.
 
Since subjects may enter the study with elevations of AST/ALT at baseline , the 
following guideline should be used for dose modifications (Table 6):

Cabozantinib treatment should also be i nterrupted when transaminase in creases are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_408251], and/or elev ations of 
coagulation tests (eg, International Normalized Ratio [INR]). Monitor ing of 
transaminases should be intensified (2–3 times per week) and cabozantin ibshould be
held until the etiology of the abnor malities is determined and these abno rmalities are
corrected or stabilize at clinically acceptable levels (INR < 1.[ADDRESS_1101789], total bilirubin
< 1.5uULN, aminotransferases < 2.[ADDRESS_1101790] or baseline).
 
Subjects must have cabozantini b permanently discontinued if tran saminase elevations 
are accompanied by [CONTACT_528930] (bilir ubin elevation
>2xULN), in the absence of evidenc e of biliary obstruction (i.e., significant elevation 
of alkaline phosphatase [ALP] ) or some other explanation of the  injury (e.g., viral
hepatitis, alcohol hepatitis), a s the combined finding (i.e., Hy ’s Law cases) represents 
a signal of a potential for the drug to cause severe liver injur y.

7.1.6 Skin Disorders
 
Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthes ia syndrome (PPE; also known as hand- foot 
syndrome), skin rash (including blister, erythematous rash, macular r ash, skin 
exfoliation, dermatitis acneiform, a nd papular rash), pruritus, dry s kin, erythema, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491], and alopecia have been reported with cabozantinib. A ll 
subjects on study should be advised on prophylactic measures including the use of 
emollients, removal of calluses, avoidance of exposure of hands and f eet to hot 
water leading to vasodilatation, protection of pressure-sensitive are as of hands and 
feet, and use of cotton gloves and socks to prevent injury and keep the pa lms and 
soles dry.
 
The onset of PPE is variable with pa resthesia (tingling, numbness) bei ng the 
characteristic initial manifestation, which can be accompanied by [CONTACT_798765]. PPE advances with symmetrical painful erythema and swollen 
areas (edema) on the palms and soles . The lateral sides of the fingers o r periungual 
zones may also be affected. Adequate in terventions are required to preven t
worsening of skin symptoms such a s blisters, desquamations, ulcerat ions, or 
necrosis of affected areas.
 
Aggressive management of symptoms is recommended, including early 
dermatology referral (Table 9). Subj ects with skin disorders should be carefully 
monitored for signs of infection (eg, abscess, cellulitis, or impeti go). In the case of 
study treatment-related skin chang es (eg, rash, hand-foot syndrome), t he 
investigator may request that add itional assessments be conducted with t he 
subject’s consent. These assessments may include digital photographs of  the skin 
changes and/or a biopsy of the affected skin and may be repeated until the s kin 
changes resolve.

7.1.7 Embolism and Thrombosis
In clinical studies with cabozantinib, venous thrombotic events (DVT a nd PE) have 
been observed in less than 10% of subjects, and arterial thromboemboli c events (MI 
and TIA) have been reported rarely. In addition, subjects with cancer ha ve a
significantly increased likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_798744].
 
Subjects who develop a PE and/or DVT should have study treatment interru pted 
until full anticoagulation is established with low molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH) or Coumadin. Anticoagu lation with LMWH is preferred over 
Coumadin if possible and feasib le. Venous filters (e.g. vena cava f ilters) are not
recommended due to the high incidence of complications associated with their use.
Once a subject is fully anticoagulated, treatment can be restarted per inv estigator
judgment at one dose lower. Subject s should permanently discontinue af ter a
second thrombotic event. Although r outine prophylactic  anticoagulati on is not
necessary for all subjects, prophylactic anticoagulation is allowed f or individual
subjects at the discretion of the investigator.
 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects who develop an acute MI or any 
other clinically significant arterial thromboembolic complication.

7.1.9 Proteinuria
 
Proteinuria has been reported with a pproved drugs that inhibit VEGF pa thways as 
well as with cabozantinib. Development and worsening of proteinuria s hould be 
monitored by [CONTACT_716138] (qualitative/semiquantitative assessment by [CONTACT_5230]; 
quantitative assessment by [CONTACT_39701]/urine creatinine ratio [UPCR ], or 24-hour 
urine protein excretion). When a UPCR exceeds 1 (mg/dL protein / mg/dL creatinine), a repeat UPCR or a 24-hour  urine protein and creatinine sh ould be 
performed to confirm the result. Caboz antinib should be discontinued in s ubjects
who develop nephrotic syndrome (prot einuria > 3.5 grams per day in combi nation

include (but may not be limited to) the following:
 
 
xTumor lesions of the lung with cavita tions or tumor lesions which invade,  
encase, or abut any major blood vessels; non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL C) 
with squamous cell differentiatio n is known for significant lung cavi tations and 
centrally located tumors that may invade major blood vessels. The anatom ic 
location and characteristics of tumor as well as the medical history sho uld be 
carefully reviewed in the selection of subjects for treatment with caboz antinib.

in clotting factors and/or platelet function, or thrombocytopenia)
xConcomitant medication with anticoagu lants or other drugs which affect normal 
hemostasis
 
Based on the described predisposing risk factors for hemoptysis, many studies with 
antiangiogenic drugs exclude subjects with NSCLC and squamous cell differentiation. Although enrollment of subjects with NSCLC with squa mous cell 
differentiation has been allowed on cabozantinib studies, cabozantin ib studies 
exclude NSCLC subjects with any of the following: tumors abutting, enca sing, or 
invading a major blood vessel; cavitating lesions; history of clinicall y significant 
hemoptysis; or recent (within 3 months) radiation therapy to the thoraci cc a v i t y  
including brachytherapy unless radiation therapy targets bone metasta sis.
 
Cabozantinib should be discontinue d in subjects with serious and life-t hreatening 
bleeding events or recent hemoptysis WHDVSRRQ (2.5ml) of red blood). 
Treatment with cabozantinib should be interrupted if less severe forms o f clinically 
significant hemorrhage occur and may be restarted after the cause of hemo rrhage 
has been identified and the risk of  bleeding has subsided. Therapy of  bleeding 
events should include supportive care and standard medical intervention s.
 
Furthermore, subjects who develop tumors abutting, encasing, or invad ing a major 
blood vessel or who develop cavitation of their pulmonary tumors while on study 
treatment must be discontinued from cabozantinib treatment.

GI-perforation/fistula:
xIntra-abdominal tumor/metastases invading GI mucosa
xActive peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative col itis,

Additional risk factors include conc urrent chronic use of steroid tre atment or

7.1.14  Endocrine Disorders
 
Prospective studies of markers of t hyroid functions are currently ongo ing in two 
single-agent studies to characterize the effects of cabozantinib on th yroid function. 
Preliminary data indicate that cabozantinib affects thyroid function te sts (TFTs) in a
high number of subjects. In Study XL184-203, 17 of 34 (50%) euthyro id subjects 
with castration-resistant prostat e cancer (CRPC) developed abnormal t hyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH) levels 6 weeks after initiation of cabozanti nib treatment 
(6% showed TSH levels between 5 and 7 mU/L, 44% had TSH > 7 mU/L). The median TSH level at week 6 was 5.2 mU/L (range, 0.02-29.7 mU/L). In a P hase 1 
combination study of rosiglitazone and cabozantinib (XL184-008) to de termine the 
potential for a clinically significant drug-drug interaction of cabo zantinib on
the 
CYP isozyme CYP2C8, subjects with advanced solid tumors (particularly renal cell 
carcinoma [RCC] and differentiated thyroid cancer [DTC]) are enrolled. Among 11 
evaluable subjects, the AE of hypothy roidism was reported in 55% of su bjects. 
Currently available data are insufficient to determine the cause of TFT alterations 
andits clinical relevance. Routine monitoring of thyroid function and asse ssments 
for signs and symptoms associated with thyroid dysfunction is recommen ded for 
subjects treated with cabozantinib. Management of thyroid dysfunction (eg,
symptomatic hypothyroidism) should follow accepted clinical practice guidelines.
 
Other endocrine disorders such as hypocalcemia and hyperglycemia, an d associated 
laboratory changes, have been observed in less than 10% of subjects. Mo nitoring 
with standard laboratory tests for endocrine disorders and clinical exa mination prior 
to initiation and during treatment with cabozantinib is recommended. Cab ozantinib 
should be discontinued in subjects with severe or life-threatening endo crine 
dysfunction.
 
 
7.1.15  Guidelines for Prevention of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has  been reported with use of antiangio genic
drugs and bisphosphonates and denosum ab in cancer patients. Additional risk 
factors for ONJ have been identifie d such as use of corticosteroids , chemotherapy,
local radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, smoking, dental or orofacial su rgery 
procedures, and cancer disease itself. Three cases of osteonecrosis hav eb e e n
reported in subjects treated with cabozantinib, the details of which are provided in
the current version of IB. As a preventive measure, invasive dental pr ocedures
should be avoided if possible in subj ects who have previously been treat ed with or 
concomitantly receive bisphosphonates or denosumab. In cases where de ntal 
procedures are unavoidable, the risks  and benefits of a dental procedur ea n dt h e  
extent of the procedure as well as t he risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_798746] f  t h ej a w  
need to be considered when deciding on the duration of a temporary treatm ent 
interruption of cabozantinib. If clinically possible, treatment with c abozantinib 
should be held for at least [ADDRESS_1101805] be discusse d with and approved by [CONTACT_17190] a case by

7.2 Potential Drug Interactions
Cytochrome P450: Preliminary data from a clinical drug interaction stud y( S t u d y  
XL184-008) show that clinically relevant steady-state concentration so f  
cabozantinib appear to have no marked effect on the AUC of co-administ ered
rosiglitazone, a CYP2C8 substrate. Therefore, cabozantinib is not ant icipated to
markedly inhibit CYP2C8 in the clinic, and by [CONTACT_151998], is not anticip ated to
markedly inhibit other CYP450 isozy mes that have lower [I]/Ki values co mpared to
CYP2C8 (ie, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP 2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4). In vitro
data indicate that cabozantinib is unlikely to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes,
except for possible induction of CYP1A1 at high cabozantinib concent rations (30
ȝ0
 
Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate (but not a CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 substra te),
based on data from in vitro studies usin g CYP-isozyme specific neutrali zing
antibodies. Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL 184-006,
showed that concurrent administ ration of cabozantinib with the stron g CYP3A4 
inducer, rifampin, resulted in an appr oximately 80% reduction in caboz antinib
exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy vo lunteers. Co-
administration of cabozantinib with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 fa mily (eg,
dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamaze pi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifap entin,
phenobarbital, and St.John’s Wort) may significantly decrease cabozantinib
concentrations. The chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avo ided.
Other drugs that induce CYP3A4 should be used with caution because thes ed r u g s  
have the potential to decrease exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib. Selecti on of 
alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme i nduction
potential is recommended. In addition, caution must be used when disco ntinuing
treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer in asubject who has been concurrently
receiving a stable dose of cabozantinib, as this could significantly i ncrease the
exposure to cabozantinib.
 
Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-007, sho wed that 
concurrent administration of caboz antinib with the strong CYP3A4 inh ibitor, 
ketoconazole, resulted in a 33-39% i ncrease in the cabozantinib exposur e( A U C  
values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Co-ad ministration
of cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (eg, ketoc onazole, 
itraconazole, clarithromycin, indi navir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir) may 
increase cabozantinib concentrations. Grapefruit / grapefruit juice an d Seville
oranges may also increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib. Stron g CYP3A4 
inhibitors and other drugs that i nhibit CYP3A4 should be used with cau tion because
these drugs have the potential to increase exposure (AUC) to cabozantin ib. Selection
of alternate concomitant medicati ons with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzy me
inhibition potential is recommended.
 
Protocol 2012-0252
November 11, 2016
Page 33
Because in vitro studies only assessed the metabolizing capacity of theCYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 pathwa ys, the potential for drugs that
inhibit/induce other CYP450 pathways (eg, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, CYP1A2) to alter cabozantinib expos ure is not known. Therefore, these drugs 
should be used with caution when given with cabozantinib.
As warfarin is metabolized thr ough the CYP450 system, therapeut ic anticoagulation 
with warfarin (eg, Coumadin) is not recommended. As an alternat ive, therapeutic 
anticoagulation may be accomplishe d using low-molecular weight heparin (eg, 
Lovenox) or heparin. 
 However, Cabozantinib und ergoes only minor CYP2C9 
metabolism and does not inhibit CYP2C9. Thus, there is no speci fic drug-drug 
contraindication and Coumadin can be utilized in select patient s if LMWH is not 
feasible.  
Please refer to the Flockhart drug interaction tables for lists of subs trates,
inducers, and inhibitors of select ed CYP450 isozyme pathways (Flockh art 2007; 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/ clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx ).
 
Protein Binding: Cabozantinib is highly protein bound (approximately 9 9.9%) to 
human plasma proteins. Therefore, highly protein bound drugs should be used with 
caution with cabozantinib because there is a potential displacement inte raction that 
could increase free concentrations of cabozantinib and/or a co-administ ered highly 
protein-bound drug (and a corresponding increase in pharmacologic effe ct). Factors 
that influence plasma protein binding may affect individual tolerance tocabozantinib. Therefore, concomitant medications that are highly prot ein bound (eg,
diazepam, furosemide, dicloxacillin, and propranolol) should be used with caution.
Because warfarin is a highly protein bound drug with a low therapeutic i ndex,
administration of warfarin at ther apeutic doses should be avoided in su bjects
receiving cabozantinib due to the poten tial for a protein binding displ acement
interaction.
 
Other Interactions: In a relative bioavailability study in dogs cabozantinib exposure
was not significantly affected by d rugs that alter gastric pH. Never theless, drugs such 
as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H 2-antagonists produce profound suppression of 
gastric acid secretion and significant increases in gastric pH. By [CONTACT_798766], 
PPIs and H 2-antagonists may decrease cabozantin ib plasma exposure levels and its 
effectiveness in vivo, resulting in clinically significant drug intera ctions. The use of 
PPIs (eg, omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and es omeprazole) 
and/or H 2-antagonists (eg, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine) is discourag ed 
during this study. If antacids are not adequate, the use of H 2blockers is preferred over 
PPIs (Note: Cimetidine should be avoi ded because of its potential to int erfere with 
CYP3A4 mediated metabolism of cabozantinib). Antacids, H 2blockers, or PPIs 
should be taken at least 2 hours (preferably 4 hours) after taking cabozantin ib but at 
least [ADDRESS_1101806] that cabozantinib is unlikely to be a substrate for  P 
glycoprotein (P-gp), but it does a ppear to have the potential to inhibi t the P-gp 
transport activity. Additional details related to these overall conclu sions are
provided in the Investigators Brochure.

9.0 Statistical Methods
 
Objectives and Sample Size: This is a phase II study of cabozantinib in pa tients with 
previously untreated androgen-dep endent disease. The primary objectiv e is to assess 
progression-free survival (PFS). W e will assess response and overall s urvival as 
secondary endpoints. A maximum of 60 pa tients will be entered into this trial, at an
expected accrual rate of 2-3 patient s per month. The trial will require approximately 24
months for patient accrual and an a dditional 9 months for patient follo w-up. If the trial
continues to maximum accrual and maintains sufficient follow-up to obse rve 49
progression events with a median P FS of 11.2 months, then a 95% credi ble interval for 
median PFS would extend from 8.5 t o 14.9 months. Based on historical m ean survival
time 11.2 months, a mean progression-free survival time on average > 13 m onths would 
be considered promising evidence of anti- disease activity.
 
Design and Interim Analysis: This is phase II study and a Bayesian model wi ll be used to 
monitor the trial with a recommendation to stop the trial if the PFS is wors e than historical 
data. In particular, we assume that time to progression T follows an ex ponential
distribution with mean μ and μ* = median (T) = μlog(2). The trial will be stopped if Pr (μ* 
<μ H* | data) > 0.95, where μ H* is the median PFS with an inverse gamma distribution
IG(22.07, 235.99), which corresponds to a 95%CI of  (7.3, 17.0) based on the historical
data (Millikan, et al., 2008). The prior for μ* is assumed to be IG(a, b ), where the
parameters a =3.25 and b = 25.25 is determined based on PFS with the sam e mean (11.2 
months) and a larger standard deviation of 10.  Assuming an accrual rat e of 2.5 per month,

The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verifying an d providing 
source documentation for all adverse e vents and assigning the attributi on for each 
event for all subjects enrolled on the trial.
 
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)
 
An adverse event or suspected advers e reaction is considered “serious” i f ,i nt h e  
view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes:
 
xDeath
xA life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that 
places the patient, in the view of the initia l reporter, at immediate risk of de ath 
from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an advers e 
experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.
xInpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_798748] t he ability to 
conduct normal life functions.
xA congenital anomaly/birth defect.
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatenin g, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience whe n, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, the y may jeopardize the patient or s ubject and 
may require medical or surgical inter vention to prevent one of the outcom es listed in
this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bron chospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dysc rasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatie nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the dev elopment of drug 
dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).
 
xImportant medical events as defined above, may also be considered seriou s 
adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as  an 
SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_798770], 
IND Office.
xAll events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the 
definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the 
timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. 
Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for Investig ators 
on Reporting Serious Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Dev ices”. 
Unless stated otherwise in the prot ocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpec ted, 
must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5
working days of knowledge of the event).
Protocol 2012-[ADDRESS_1101811] a written report submitted within 24 hours (nextworking day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in t he 
IND Office.
xUnless otherwise noted, the electr onic SAE application (eSAE) will be  
utilized for safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.
xSerious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protoco l-
specific intervention, until [ADDRESS_1101812] be reported to the INDOffice. This may include the development of a secondary malignancy.
 
Reporting to FDA:
 
xSerious adverse events will be forwar ded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Sa fety
Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_798749] g to the Code of Federal Regulat ions, 
Good Clinical Practices, the protoc ol guidelines, the sponsor’s guid elines, and 
Institutional Review Board policy.
 
Investigator Communication  with Supporting Companies:
 
As soon as an investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the defini tion of
‘serious,’ this should be documented to the extent that information is av ailable.
 
xThis report must be submitted by [CONTACT_798771], even if it is not felt to be drug related. Email:  
[EMAIL_131] ;Fax [PHONE_154]
xThe investigator agrees to provide supplementary information requested by [CONTACT_798772].
xPregnancy, although not itself an SAE , should also be reported on an SAE form
or pregnancy form and be followed up to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary terminati on, details of birth, and the presen ce or 
absence of any birth defects or congenital abnormalities.
 
Regulatory Reporting:
 
All serious unexpected adverse drug reactions (unexpected related SAE s) must be 
reported to the Food and Drug Adminis tration (FDA) by [CONTACT_798773] 21 CFR 312.32.
 
xThese reports are to be filed utilizing the Form FDA 3500A (MedWatch Form )o r  
the MDACC SAE form.
The final MedWatch or MDACC Form must be submitted by [CONTACT_798774] 2012-0252

11.2  Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events
 
The results of all laboratory tests required by [CONTACT_798775]’s medical record. All clinically important abnormal laboratory tests occurring 
during the study will be repeated at appropriate intervals until they retu rn either to 
baseline or to a level deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_798776].
 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal laboratory test result should be 
reported as an adverse event are as follows:
 
1.   Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or2.   Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/su rgical intervention, 
and/or
3.   Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation fro m the study, 
significant additional concomitant dr ug treatment or other therapy, an d/or
4.   Test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of  a SAE, 
and/or
5.   Test result is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_093].
 
*Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above con ditions, 
does not meet Condition [ADDRESS_1101813] result that is determined to be an error does not requir e reporting 
as an adverse event, even if it did meet one of the above conditions except for 
Condition 4.
 
 
11.3  Management of Persistent and Refractory Toxicity
 
Utilizing the NCI CTCAE (version 4.0) , events which are moderate and int erfere with 
function that are not consistent with a patient’s medical history, and are refractory to 
medical treatment, should be investig ated carefully to ensure that no ot her etiology is 
present. Study drug will be held for any toxicity events deemed definite ly,probably, 
or possibly drug-related (such as diarrhea, hypertension, vomiting, diarrhea, and 
dizziness) and that are greater than grade 2.  Drug will be held until sev erity is reduced
to Grade 1 or less and then resumed daily dosing with a dose reduction as  outlined in
Section 6.0.
 
 
11.4  Management of All Other Toxicities
 
Other toxicities may occur. Supportive care should be prescribed as need ed. They 
may also be prescribed prophylactically to prevent toxicity from develop ing or

recurring. The examples include anti-emetics for nausea/vomiting, ana lgesics for 
pain, antipyretics for fever and antidiarrheals for diarrhea
 
Abnormal laboratory values will be onl y be captured as adverse events if t hey are
Grade [ADDRESS_1101814] management (eg, dose reduction or delay or requirement for additional
medication or 
monitoring) or that is considered to be of clinical significance by [CONTACT_798777].
 
11.5.2  Medication Errors/ Overdose
Any study drug administration error or overdose that results in an AE, even if it
does not meet the definition of serious, requires reporting within [ADDRESS_1101815] be
followed until either resolution of the event or determination by [CONTACT_798778]. This follow-up guidance als o applies to 
related SAEs that occur > [ADDRESS_1101816] dose of study treatment. The status 
of all other continuing AEs will be documented as of 30 days after the las t dose of 
study treatment.
 
12.0  PUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS
 
The Principal Investigator (Protocol Chair) holds the primary responsib ility for 
publication of the study results; pr ovided that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_798750], Inc. for review at least sixty (60) days prior to submission and also comply
with any provisions regarding publication as are agreed to between the P I’s institution

Amendment 1 17 January 2017 Protocol title page – added the European Clinical 
Trials Database (EudraCT) Number.
Schedule of activities footnote: clarified that blood 
pressure and other vital signs are to be collected with the subject in the sitting position.
Schedule of activities: added an electrocardiogram 
(ECG) assessment at study Day 1, pre-dose. This addition was made to ensure a baseline ECG is collected just prior to initial study administration. Decreased the resting time required prior to vital sign and ECG collection, from [ADDRESS_177432]. 
Section 4.2: Added psoriasis medications 
Secukinumab (Cosentyx), and Ixekizumab (Taltz) 
as exclusionary and prohibited during the study.  Added Apremilast (Otezla) as exclusionary if taken within [ADDRESS_177433] 2016 and 3 Nov 2016.
Appendix 4, Prohibited Concomitant Medications: 
are P-gp (MDRI) substrates (eg, digoxin), P-gp inhibitor eg, quinidine or OCT2/ MATE substrate (eg, dofetilide). Subjects receiving drugs with narrow therapeutic index that are P-gp (MDRI) substrates (eg, digoxin) and drugs that are substrates of OCT2/ MATE (eg, dofetilide) and potent inhibitors of P-gp eg, quinidine are excluded from participation in the study to limit any potential interactions with the investigational product.

This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter 
study in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  During the first 4 week treatment period, 2 oral daily dose levels (30 mg and 60 mg) of PF-06700841, plus matching placebo, will be investigated.  During the 8 week maintenance treatment period (Weeks 5 through 12), subjects will receive either [ADDRESS_177448] participation will be approximately 26 weeks, including screening, 12 week treatment period, and 8 week follow up period. 
Statistical Methods: 
The analysis of the primary endpoint will be change from baseline in PASI score at Week 12, 
with treatment effect in each of the active treatment groups defined as the placebo adjusted change from baseline in PASI score at Week 12 (mean change from baseline at Week 12 in the active treatment group minus the mean change from baseline at Week 12 in the placebo group).CCI

Page 181. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Mechanism of Action/ Indication
PF-06700841 is a potent TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor with an excellent selectivity profile over the 
other human kinases.  Thus, PF -[ADDRESS_177454] epi[INVESTIGATOR_153806] d by 
[CONTACT_153836].1,3,4  
Chronic plaque psoriasis is a common skin disorder with a worldwide prevalence of 2% and 
afflicts an estimated 5.[ADDRESS_177455] the quality  of life resulting 
in impairment akin to other major diseases such as ty pe2 diabetes, m yocardial infarction, 
and arthritis.6
1.2.Background and Rationale
The Janus kinase (JAK) family , including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, is a group of 
cytoplasmic t yrosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via interactions with Type 1 
and Ty pe2 cytokine receptors critical for immune cell function, survival, activation, and 
proliferation.7,8  JAK2 homodimers are critical for the signaling of hematopoietic cy tokines 
and hormones including erythropoietin (EPO), IL -3, granulocy te-macrophage 
colony -stimulating factor (GM -CSF) and prolactin.
JAK1 -dependent cy tokines include IFN-alpha, IFN -gamma, IL -6, IL -21, and IL -22.  IL -[ADDRESS_177456]  in the treatment of psoriasis.
PF-06700841 is a dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor with good selectivity  profile over oth er human 
kinases .  Based on its cy tokine inhibition profile, PF -[ADDRESS_177457] in human clinical trial of 
PF-06700841 (S tudy B7931001), psoriasis subjects receiving active treatment with 
PF-06700841 (30 mg or 100 mg once dail y for 28 days) had clinically  meaningful decreases 
in disease activit y as measured b y PASI .  Preliminary  safety ,efficacy  and pharmacod ynamic 
results from Study B7931001 support further development of PF -06700841 in plaque 
psoriasis.
The current trialB7931004 is a Phase 2 study  that will assess the safet y and efficacy of 
several dose levels of PF -06700841, and will include daily  and weekl y dosing regimens in 
subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
1.3.Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Me tabolism
The pharmacokinetics ( PK)of PF -
[ADDRESS_177458] been studied in rat where the compound 
has shown a plasma clearance of 31 mL/min/kg, a volume of distribution of 2.0 L/kg, and 
oral bioavailability  of approximately  80-100%.  The high oral bioavailability  indicated high 
absorption from the gut, consistent with its high in -vitro passive permeability  properties.  Rat 
in vivo clearance was predicted within approximately 2- fold b y both in vitro rat liver 
microsomes and hepatocy te intrinsic clearance highlig hting the importance of CYP450 
metabolism.  Sy stemic exposures of PF -06700841 as measured b y
Cmaxand area under the 
curve at 24 hours ( AUC 24)in repeat oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_153807] (up to 55 mg/kg/day ) and monkey s(up to 45 mg/kg/day ).  Renal and biliary  
elimination of parent PF -06700841 was limited in rat.
Plasma protein binding of PF -06700841 was consistent across rat, monkey , and human with 
a fraction unbound (fu) of approximatel y 0.6 -0.7.  Values of fu were low er in mouse 
(fu=0.51) and rabbit (fu = 0.36).
Oxidative metabolites of PF -06700841 accounted for the primary  routes of biotransformation 
in rat, monkey, and human consistent with CYP450 as the primary  clearance route.  No 
unique human metabolites of PF -06700841 were evident compared to the safet y species of 
rat and monkey .
Clearance phenot
ypi[INVESTIGATOR_153808] -06700841 indicated that CYP3A4 will be the predominant 
mediator of human metabolism with minor contributions from CYP1A2, 2C19, and 2D6.

Page 20PF-06700841 showed a low risk of CYP450 inhibition and induction, uridine glucuron yl 
transferase ( UGT )inhibition, OATP1B1/1B3 inhibition, and MDR1 inhibition.  
PF-06700841 showed some potential to inhibit metformin mediated transport by [CONTACT_63396]2 
(IC50=1.1M), MATE1 (I C50=7.7M) and MATE2K (IC 50=17M) in vitro.  The respective 
unbound I max/IC50ratios are 0.65, 0.09, and 0.04 for a predicted 60 mg clinical dose of 
PF-06700841 (unbound C max=0.72M).  SimCYP modeling indicated a low risk of 
drug-drug interactions (DDI) perpetrat ed by a 60 mg once dail y (QD) dose of PF -06700841 
(Cmax/AUC ratios 1.19/1.20 ).
1.4.Non-Clinical Safety Studies
PF-06700841 was evaluated in single- dose and repeat -dose toxicity studies up to 6 months 
(rats) and 9 months (monkey s) in duration.  Dose range -findi ng and pi[INVESTIGATOR_88779] o-fetal 
development studies (EFD) were conducted with PF -06700841 in rats and rabbits.  Target 
organs identified with PF -06700841 administration in rats and cy nomolgus monkey s include 
the immune and hemolymphatic sy stems (thy mus, spleen, ly mph nodes, and bone marrow) , 
gastrointestinal tract (body weight and weight gain effects ), and adrenal gland (vacuolation).  
The findings in the thy mus, spleen, ly mph nodes, and bone marrow are consistent with the 
pharmacological activity  of PF -[ADDRESS_177459] article -related infections in these animals.   Gastrointestinal and 
adrenal effects were not a dverse because they  were either transient, of small magnitude 
and/or severit y, and/or lacked associated tissue injury or inflammation, or changes in clinical 
pathology  parameters. In addition, there were inconsistent findings in the bone, liver, lung 
and prostate where the relationship to PF -06700841 is less clear.  Adverse findings in the 
central nervous s ystem ( decreased activity , mortality , prostration, convulsions) were 
observed at high exposures in pregnant rabbits, and emesis was observed in monkey s at high

-06700841- related effects were observed in the cardiovascular s ystem (blood pressure, 
heart rate, QTc interval) and central nervous s ystem (decreased locomotor activity ).Based 
on the lack of adverse findings at any  dose, t he no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) 
in the 6- month rat and 9 -month monkey  studies were 45 mg/kg/day  in rats and 20 mg/kg in 
cynomolgus monkey s.  Exposures at these doses were 6.2x to 40x the predicted efficacious 
human exposure (C max= 218 ng/mL  and AUC 24=
1730 ng•h/mL )from a 50 mg dose .
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_153809] y in rats, there were no PF -06700841- related maternal effects.  
However, higher incidences of fetal skeletal malformations (in long bones , scapulae, 
sternebrae or palatine bones) and variations (in the ribs, cervical vertebrae or sternebrae) 
occurred at 
2mg/kg/day , and delay s in the ossification of the axial and appendicular 
skeleton occurred at 15 mg/kg/day .  In addition, lower embry o-fetal viability ; lower mean 
fetal bod y weights, external malformations (cleft palate) and variations (whole body 
subcutaneous edema or edematous neck) occurred at 15 mg/kg/day .  The maternal NOAEL 
in rats was 15 mg/kg/day (13x and 11x the predicted efficacio us human C maxand AUC 24
exposure from a 50 mg dose ) and the developmental NOAEL was not determined but was 
<2mg/kg/day , the lowest dose tested (2.2x and 1.3x the predicted efficacious human Cmax
and AUC 24exposure from a 50 mg dose ).  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_153810] s tudy in rabbits, there were no 

PF-[ADDRESS_177460] -
implantation loss occurred at 3mg/kg/day  and lower mean numbers of 
viable fetuses occurred at 7 mg/kg/day . Test article -related skeletal variations were observed 
at 3mg/kg/day , but were not adverse because most of these findings represent delay s in 
ossification that would resolve with further growth and development.  The maternal NOAEL 
in rabbits was 7 mg/kg /day, the highest dose tested, (6.6x and 3.2x the predicted efficacious 
human C maxand AUC 24exposure from a 50 mg dose ) and the developmental NOAEL was 
1mg/kg/day  (0.8x and 0.4x the predicted efficacious human C maxand AUC 24exposure from 
a 50 mg dose ).
PF-06700841 was negative for mutagenicity in the bacterial reverse mutation assay s.  
Although PF -06700841 was positive in the in vitro micronucleus 
assay s in both CHO and 
TK6 cells, and was aneugenic in vitro (at 72,100 nM), it did not induce micronuclei, in vivo, 
in reticulocy tes in the 1 -month study  in rats (at exposures 35x to 51x the predicted human 
efficacious exposure (unbound C max= 218 ng/mL and AUC 24= 1730 ng•h/mL )from a 50 mg 
dose.
Although PF -06700841 absorbs in the 
ultraviolet A (UVA) andultraviolet B (UVB )range,
PF-06700841 ( 100mg/kg/day  [unbound C maxand AUC 24were 46x and 82x the predicted

1.5.1. Summary of Clinical Safety Experience with PF-06700841
PF-06700841 was generally  safe and well tolerate d in the Phase 1 clinical study  B7931001, 
which included both heal thy subjects (n=66 randomized) and subjects with plaque psoriasis 
(n=30 randomized).  There were no deaths in the study , no serious adverse events, and no 
severe adverse events. Subjects re ported 11 treatment emergent adverse events TEAEs in the 
SAD phase, 22 TEAEs in the MAD phase, 39 TEAEs in the psoriasis phase, and 3 TEAEs in 
the BA phase.  All adverse events ( AEs)were mild or moderate in severit y.  Dose escalation

The most commonly  reported all causality  TEAEs across active subjects in both SAD and 
MAD cohorts were blood creatinine increased (reported in 2 subjects during the SAD period 
and 11 subjects during the MAD period), and neut ropenia/neutrophil count decreased 
(reported in 4 subjects during the MAD period), which belong to the Sy stem Organ Class 
(SOC) categories of Investigations and Blood and Ly mphatic S ystem Disorders , respectivel y.
During the SAD/MAD, the AEs of blood creati nine increased were reported across dose 
levels from [ADDRESS_177465] frequency in the 
175mg QD and 50 mg BID MAD cohorts.  Common terminology  criteria for adverse events 
(CTCAE ) Grade 3 neutropenia occurred at the 175 mg QD and 50 mg BID dose levels during 
the MAD period.  All laboratory  abnormalities reported as AEs were mild in severit y, except 
for one case of neutropenia which was reported as moderate in severity  (Grade 3 
neutropenia).  No neutrophil counts reached, or fell below 500 cells/mm3 during the study.
Other commonly  reported all causality  TEAEs during the SAD/MAD by  [CONTACT_153837] ( 2events of headache and 1 event each of dizziness and pres yncope during 
the SAD period, and 1 event each of headache, presy ncope, and s yncope reported during the 
MAD period), and Infections and I nfestations (upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_153813]

The most commonly  reported all causality  TEAEs across active subjects in the psoriasis 
cohorts treated with either 30 mg or 100 mg PF -06700841 were blood creatinine increased 
(reported in 7 subjects in the 30 mg dose group and 6 subjects in the 100 mg dose group),

Other commonly  reported AEs by  [CONTACT_153838] ( headache reported in [ADDRESS_177468] in the 100 mg dose group), 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (constipation reported in 3 subjects in the 30 mg dose group), and 
Infections and Infestations ([ADDRESS_177469] infection and 1 report of herpes 
zoster infection, both in the 100 mg dose group).
The AE of herpes zoster occurred in a single subject after completing [ADDRESS_177470] presented on Study  Day 30 
(2days after the last dose of PF -06700841).  The AE was mild in severit y and was treated 
with acy clovir and Vicodin by  [CONTACT_737].
In the BA cohort, the SOCs with subjects reporting AEs were Gastrointestinal Disorders, 
Injury , Poisoning, and Procedural Complications, and Nervous S ystem Disorders, each 
reported b y 1subject. The reported AEs were nausea, contusion, and headache, each of 
which was experienced by [ADDRESS_177471].  Subjects in the PF -06700841 100 mg oral 
solution/suspension fasted group reported 1 treatment -related TEAE each of nausea and 
headache.  All TEAEs were mild in severit y.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_153815] (n=13 in the 
SAD/MAD cohorts) and psoriasis patients (n=13), review of clinical laboratory  parameters 
from Study B7931001 confirmed there have been no noted clinically  meaningf ul changes in 
the blood urea nitrogen, serum electroly tes, urinaly sis, or cy statin -c based estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the subjects with elevated serum creatinine. Serum 
creatinine is primarily  filtered by  [CONTACT_153839]; approximat ely 10-20% is activel y 
secreted into the renal proximal tubules.  The active tubular secretion is mediated b y 
transporters such as OCT2, OAT2 and MATEs.  The proposed mechanism for the observed 
serum creatinine increases observed in Study B7931001 is inhib ition of creatinine transport 
(ie, transporter -mediated rather than direct nephrotoxicity ), and is based on PF -06700841 
potential to inhibit OCT2 creatinine transporter (IC 50=1.1M; unbound I max/IC50ratio=0.25).  
To differentiate from direct nephrotoxicity , the B7931001 protocol was amended (Protocol 
Amendment 2) to include collection of serum cy statin C.  Serum cystatin C was used to 
calculate eGFR in order to monitor for nephrotoxicity  during the trial.  Elevated serum 
creatinine in the absence of clini cally  meaningful changes in serum cy statin C based 
estimated GFR during S tudy B7931001 supports the transporter inhibition hy pothesis.
Following the implementation of cy statin C based safet y monitoring, no subjects were 
discontinued from treatment/study  due to renal concerns.
Proof of mechanism for JAK -1 inhibition was demonstrated in Study B7931001 by [CONTACT_153840] (PD )biomarkers hs -CRP and I P-10. Safet y data generated in Study 
B7931001 support PF -06700841’s further clinical development in patients with 
moderate -severe plaque psoriasis.

1.6.Study Rationale
This multicenter, placebo controll ed study  is being conducted to provide additional 
PF-06700841 safety  and tolerability  data, and to further explore the clinical efficacy  of 
PF-06700841 in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis following clinical 
results from the B7931001 Pha se1 study .Additionally , the study  is intended to enable 
selection of oral dose and dosing regimen (dail y vs. weekl y chronic administration) for the 
future clinical development of PF -
06700841. The current nonclinical toxicology  package 
supports the plan ned treatment duration of up to 12 weeks.
The completed B7931001 Phase 1 study  included Single Ascending Dosing (SAD) and 
Multiple Ascending Dosing (MAD) in healthy volunteers, Proof of Mechanism (PoM) and 
small efficacy  investigations in patients with pso riasis. The study  demonstrated acceptable 
safet y and PK profile at single PF -06700841 doses from 1 to 200 mg, and once dail y doses 
(QD) from 10 to 175 mg, and 50 mg twice dail y (BI D)for ten day s.Dose escalation 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_153812] y dose level during the SAD/MAD investigations.
Additionally , clinical benefit was seen in subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis as measured 
by [CONTACT_153842] 28 day treatment period.   In subjects 
completing through study  
Day28, the mean placebo adjusted change from baseline in PASI  
score at W eek4 was -9.6 for the 30mg cohort (n=7), and -14.2 for the 100 mg cohort (n=5).  
Sustained efficacy  was observed at approximatel y 1month after last dose of [ADDRESS_177477] both daily  and weekl y 
dosing regimens ( Figure 1).
The total treatment duration of 12 weeks in B7931004 will allow further exploration of the 
clinical efficacy  observed in the 4 week small efficacy  study completed in the Phase 1 study  
B7931001. Continuo us change from baseline in PASI  score at Week 12 will be used as the 
primary  endpoint to gain sensitivity  and efficiency regarding statistical power.  The o nce 
daily  PF-06700841 induction doses to be explored in the current study  will be below the 
100mg d ose level ,(eg,30mg and 60 mg) in order to adequatel y evaluate clinical efficacy 
while minimizing safety  risk. To further improve the risk/benefit, the stud y will explore a 
step down maintenance daily  dosing with PF -06700841 10 mg and 30 mg for 8 weeks after 
the initial 4 week dosing with 30 mgor 60 mg QD. PF-06700841 100 mg once weekl y 
(QW) will also be investigated in order to evaluate the clinical utility  of a weekl y 
maintenance dosing in subjects with plaque psoriasis.
Given the assumed PF -06700841 mediated inhibition of creatinine transport in the kidney , 
the inclusion of serum cystatin –C collection at baseline, end of treatment, and as indicated 
during the trial ( see Section 7.1.3) willfacilitate calculation of eGFR at these time points to 
provide a reliable assess ment of renal function .
1.7.Dose Rationale
The dose selection strategy  was designed to balance pharmacolog y and safety. A global PK 
model was developed using the data from the first-in-human study  (Protocol B7931001). PK 
was assumed to be similar between health y subjects and psoriasis subjects. The activity  of 
the JAK inhibitors was assessed by  [CONTACT_153843] y that were collected in the FIH study  and analy zed using indirect response modeling.
The magnitude of change in these markers required for efficacy  and/ or safety  is poorl y 
understood.
The predicted PK parameters for PF -06700841 based on simulations using the global PK 
model and pre dicted PD during the induction period (4 weeks) are provided in 
Table 4.

Page 30The 100 mg once weekly (QW) regimen during the chronic dosing period (8 weeks) was 
used to provide guidance as to the minimum projected safety margins during this period. The projected safety margins for C
max and AUC tauare approximately 4.3- and 2.4-fold, 
respectively.
During the chronic dosing period the 30 mg QD induction and maintenance dose or the 
60 mg QD induction dose followed by 30 mg QD are projected to reduce hsCRP and IP-10 by [CONTACT_3450] 82% and 47%, respectively. These doses are projected to reduce neutrophils by [CONTACT_3450] 30% and reticulocytes by 36%.  The regimens that included 100 mg QW in the chronic dosing period are projected to reduce hsCRP and IP-10 by [CONTACT_3450] 58% and 27%, respectively.  The associated changes for neutrophils and reticulocytes are expected to be minimal (~14%). Overall, the doses selected for this study are expected to demonstrate clinically relevant efficacy in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis.
1.8. Summary of Benefits and Risks
Overall, the safety profile observed during the Phase [ADDRESS_177479] treated with 100 mg PF-6700841 for 4 weeks.  As with other immunomodulators, the risk of infection is potential concern due to the immunosuppressive effects of PF-06700841.  To limit this risk, a maximum daily dose below 100 mg (the dose associated with infection in the Phase 1 study B7931001) will be used in this Phase 2 trial.  In addition, a variety of step down approaches including a weekly dosing will be tested in this study in order to identify a dose(s) and dosing regimen(s) with an acceptable risk /benefit profile.
Additional information for this compound may be found in the single reference safety 
document (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure.

the study will receive PF-06700841, which has been associated with
demonstrat ed teratogenicity /fetotoxicity in animals . Subjects who are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the 
investigator, sexually  active and at risk for pregnancy  with their partner(s) must agree to use
2methods of highly  effective contraception throughout the study  and for at least [ADDRESS_177499] and his /herpartner (s)from the list of permitted 
contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has been instructed in 
their consistent and correct use.  At time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities, t he 
investigator or designee will inform the subject of the need to use 2highl y effective methods 
of contraception consistently  and correctly and document the conversation, and the subject’s 
affirmation, in the subject’s chart.   In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the 
subject to call immediately  if1 or both of the selected contraception method sis discontinued 
or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the subject or partner .
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% pe r year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie,perfect use) and 
include
the following:
1.Established use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg, oral, inse rted, injected, implanted, transdermal), provided the subje ct or 
male subject’s female partner plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the 
entire study  and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of 
time to ensure effectiveness .
2.Correctl y placed copper -containing intrauterine dev ice (IUD ).
3.Male condom or female con dom used WI TH a separate spermicide product (ie,foam, 
gel, film, cream, or suppository ).For countries where spermicide is not available or 
condom plus spermicide is not accepted as highly  effective contraception, this option 
is not appropriate.
4.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the postvasectomy  ejaculate .
5.Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure 
(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accord ance with the device’s label).

5.STUDY TREA TMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmoni s ation ( ICH)
guidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference /comparator in a cl inical trial, 
including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or 
packaged) in a way  different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about an approve d use (ICH E6 1.33).
For this study , the investigational product is PF -06700841. The designation PF -0670841-15 
indicates a salt of the drug substance.  References to either PF -
06700841 or PF-0670841-15 
indicate the same biological entity .
5.1.
Allocation to Treatment
Allocation of subjects to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an interactive 
response technology  (IRT) system ( interactive Web- based response [IWR]).  The site 
personnel (stud y coordinator or specified designee) will be required to ent er or select 
information including but not limited to the user’s identification ( ID)and password, 
the 
protocol number ,andthe subject number. The site personnel will then be provided with a 
treatment assignment ,randomization number, and dispensable uni t (DU) or container number 
when investigational product is being supplied via the I RTsystem .  The IRT sy stem will 
provide a confirmation report containing the subject number , randomization number ,and DU 
or container number assigned.
  The confirmation rep ort must be stored in the site’s files.
The study -specific I RT reference manual will provide the contact [CONTACT_110275] .

food; however, for study visit days , subjects are to be instructed to refrain from dosing at 
home, and are to take the dose in the clinic from their previous blister card and dose from the 
newly  dispensed blister card on the next day  at home .
If a dose is missed and the interval to the next dose is less than [ADDRESS_177504] be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room- temperature product s).  This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they  are maintained in working order.
Any excursions from the product la bel storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery .  The site should actively  pursue options for returning the product to the storage 
conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, incl uding any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to [COMPANY_007].
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until [COMPANY_007] provides permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be considere d a 
protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the use of the investigational product after the 
temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to [COMPANY_007] approval will be 
considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report 
for each excursion will be provided to the site.
Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where 
the products are briefl y out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not 
considered excursions.

about the reason for withdrawal, reque st that the subject return all unused investigational 
product(s), request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with 
the subject regarding an y unresolved adverse e vents ( AEs).
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ens ure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However ,it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessar y to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the subject. When a protocol -required test cannot be performed ,the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
heor she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner .

PF-[ADDRESS_177510] safety assessments include physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead

In the absence of regular menstrual bleeding, the study candidate should have used [ADDRESS_177516] has not become pregnant during the study.  Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period and when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected, and may be repeated if requested by [CONTACT_110453] (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by [CONTACT_427].  In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the subject will be withdrawn from administration of investigational product and from the study.
7.1.3. Serum Creatinine and Serum Cystatin-C
Serum creatinine is the best known standard test for monitoring renal function. However, 
serum creatinine based estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may be affected by [CONTACT_153848], including chronic and acute illness.  Cystatin C is a test that can be used either as an adjunct to or a replacement for serum creatinine.  The most reliable estimates of GFR use both test results.
16
Cystatin C is a low molecular weight protein that is used as an alternative to serum creatinine for monitoring of renal function.  It seems to correlate more closely with GFR than does serum creatinine concentration and may be a more sensitive detector of early renal dysfunction.
17,18While use of cystatin C has been limited, its independence of demographic 
factors (eg, race) has made it an interesting means of determining changes in renal function C

Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.   Estimated GFR may  be calculated via the 2012 CKD -EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_10426], cy statin C, or creatinine -Cystatin C equations
.19
Serum creatinine will be measure d as part of serum chemistry  at times specified in the 
Schedule of Activities section of the protocol. Serum creatinine based eGFR will be 
calculated.  Serum cy statin C and cy statin C based eGFR will be measured a t baseline and 
end of treatment ( EOT) .  An increase in serum creatinine above the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) as defined b y the laboratory  reference range should trigger a reflex test for serum 
cystatin -C in order to facilitate both cy statin C based and se rum creatinine based eGFR 
calculations.
7.1.4. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate
Serum creatinine and serum cy statin -C based estimated GFR (eGFR) will be calculated at 
baseline and end of study treatment period for all subjects , in order to facilitate calculation of 
eGFR at these time points .  When cy statin -C reflex testing is performed, corresponding 
serum creatinine and cy statin -C based eGFR will be determined to assess renal function.
The estimated GFR (eGFR) will be calculated using the 2sets of equations developed b y the 
Chronic Kidney  Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8849] (CKD -EPI), which utilize serum 
creatinine (SCr) and serum Cy statinC (S Cy statin C) respectivel y.[ADDRESS_177517]
Subjects may  be screened for TB using an IGRA per local guidelines.  Interferon gamma 
release assay  will be tested during screening or within 12 weeks prior to Day 1.  The 
following are acceptable IGRA assay s: QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT- G), 
QuantiF ERON-TB Gold I n-Tube test (QFT -GIT) and T -SPOTTB test.  Site personnel 
should follow the processing and anal yses steps based on the assay  chosen.  Ensure 
incubation steps are followed as appropriate.
An IGRA is preferred for subjects with a prior Bacillus Calmette -Guerin ( BCG ) vaccination, 
but may  be used for any  subject.  Documentation of IGRA product used and the test result 
must be in the subject’s source documentation.
If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may  be repeated, and if a negative result 
is obtained, enrollment may  proceed. A positive test on repeat is exclusionary .
Subjects with repeat indeterminate IGRA results may  be enrolled after consultation with 
pulmonary  or infectious disease specialist that determines low risk of i nfection (ie, subject 
would be acceptable for immunosuppressant (eg, anti- TNF) treatment without additional 
action).
Subjects who test positive for QFT -G/ QFT -GIT test, but in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_153829]. Subjects will be eligible if the repeat test 
is negative before the randomization.

additional specimens for viral DNA analysis will be obtained for confirmation.  
 
 
Details for these collections will be 
provided in the laboratory manual.
7.1.7. Medical History, Physical Examination, Height and Weight
Medical history will be collected at the Screening visit and will include history of drug, 
alcohol and tobacco use.  Medical history also includes collection of details on (i) Family history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and premature coronary heart disease (CHD), where premature CHD is defined as (a) CHD in a male first degree relative <55 years of age, or (b) CHD in a female first degree relative <65 years of age, (ii) Any prior rheumatologist confirmed diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, (iii) Any prior diagnosis of dry eye disease/syndrome, and (iv) Any previous history of liver biopsy.  Smoking status and average weekly alcohol consumption (units/week) will also be collected, where a unit contains 12 g of pure alcohol, an amount equivalent to that contained in 5 oz (a glass) of wine, [ADDRESS_177518] be performed by [CONTACT_093], sub-investigator, or 
a qualified healthcare professional per local guidelines.  A complete physical examination will include general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat (HEENT), heart, lungs, breast (optional), abdomen, external genitalia (optional), extremities, neurologic function, back, and lymph nodes.
Targeted physical examinations must be performed by [CONTACT_093], sub-investigator, or a 
qualified healthcare professional per local guidelines. Targeted physical examination consists of skin, heart, lungs, abdomen, and examination of body systems where there are symptom complaints by [CONTACT_423].
Complete and Targeted physical examinations are performed at specified time points (see 
Schedule of Activities ).
Height and weight will be measured without the subject wearing shoes.  Height (inches or 
centimeters) will be measured and recorded at the Screening visit only and weight (lbs or kg) will be measured and recorded at various time points (see Schedule of Activities ).
7.1.8. Vital Sign Measurements (Blood pressure, pulse rate, and temperature)
Single sitting blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, and temperature will be measured at times 
specified in the Schedule of Activities .  Additional collection times or changes to collection 
times will be permitted, as necessary to ensure appropriate collection of safety data.CC
I
PF-[ADDRESS_177519]’s arm supported at the level of the 
heart, and recorded to the nearest mm Hg.  It is preferred that the same arm (preferabl y the 
dominant arm) be used throughout the study .
The same size BP cuff, which has been properl y sized and calibrated, will be used to measure 
BP each time.  The use of automated devices for measuring BP and pulse rate is acceptable, 
although, when done manually, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at 
least 30 seconds.  When the timing of these measurements coincides with a blood collection, 
it is preferred that vital signs be obtained prior to the nominal time of blood collection.
It is preferred that bod y temperature be collected using ty mpanic , oral, or axillary  methods 
and that the same method be used consistently  throughout the study .
7.1.9. Electrocardiogram
Twelve (12) lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the Schedule of Activities .
ECGs s hould be performed before laboratory  blood collection.
All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly  for at least 
5minutes ina supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  When the timing of these measurements coincides with a 
blood collection, the EC
G should be obtained prior to the nominal time of the blood 
collection, BP, and pulse rate.
To ensure safet y of the subjects, a qualified individual (eg, sub -investigator) at the 
investigator site will make comparisons to baseline measurements taken at scr eening.  A 
copy  of the ECG should be available as source documents for review.  ECGs will be read 
locally  during the dosing period. 
In some cases, it may  be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  If a machine -read QTc 
value is prolonged, repeat measurements may  not be necessary  if a qualified phy sician’s 
interpretation d etermines that the QTc values are in the acceptable range.
7.1.10. Chest Radiograph
Chest x- ray (posterior -anterior and lateral views are recommended however local guidelines 
should be followed) or other appropriate diagnostic image (ie, computed t omograph y[CT] o r 
magnetic 
resonance imaging [MRI ]) with no current evidence of untreated latent or active 
TB infection or evidence of currently  active TB, general infections, heart failure or 
malignancy  taken at screening or within the [ADDRESS_177520], or qualified medical professional.  Detailed descriptions for the Physician Global Assessment, , and are provided in the Appendices.
7.2.1. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)
The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index quantifies the severity of a subject’s psoriasis based 
on both lesion severity and the percentage of body surface area affected.
Lesion severity: the basic characteristics of psoriatic lesions – erythema, induration and 
scaling – provide a means for assessing the severity of lesions.  Assessment of these three main signs is performed separately for four areas of the body: head, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs.  Average erythema, induration and scaling are rated for each body area according to a 5-point scale: 0, no involvement; 1, slight; 2, moderate; 3, marked; 4, very marked.
Body surface area (BSA) involvement: the extent (%) to which each of the four areas of the 
body is affected by [CONTACT_153849] a numerical score according to the following area scoring criteria: 0, no involvement; 1, >0 to 9%; 2, 10 to 29%; 3, 30 to 49%; 4, 50 to 69%; 5, 70 to 89%; 6, 90 to 100%.
Calculating PASI
In each area, the sum of the severity rating scores for erythema, induration and scaling is 
multiplied by [CONTACT_153850], multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4).  The sum of the numbers obtained for each of the four body areas is the PASI.
21
PASI = 0.1Ah(Eh + Ih + Sh) + 0.2Au(Eu + Iu + Su) +
0.3At(Et + It + St) + 0.4Al(El + Il + Sl)
where A = area of involvement score; E = erythema; I =induration; S = scaling; h = head; u = upper limbs; 
t = trunk; l = lower limbs
The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 units from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores 
representing increasing severity of psoriasis.  The PASI score will be used for the primary analysis.
Calculation of PASI will be done centrally by [CONTACT_153851].CCI

Final Protocol Amendment 1, 13 February 2017
Page 567.2.2. Linear Method Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (L PASI)
A second method of calculating PASI  will also be performed.  A linear scaling method will 
be applied to the Psoriasis Area and Severit y Index calculation, adapting the classic 
calculation b y using the actual percentage bod y surface area involved in psoriasis rather than 
categorizing the percentage involvement on a 7 point scale. 
The linear scaling method will be calculated from the study database; investigator sites will 
only perform the classic PASI  calculation during the study .  The L PASI  score will be used 
for a sensitivity anal ysis.
L-PASI Calculation
L-PASI = 0.1(6xBh)x(Eh + Ih + Sh) + 0.2(6Bu)x(Eu + I u + Su) +
0.3(6xBt)x(Et + It + St) + 0.4(6xBl)x(El + Il + Sl)
where B = percentage area of involvement; E = erythema; I =induration; S = scaling; h =head; u = upper 
limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs
7.2.3. Physician Global Assessment (PGA)
The Phy sician Global Assessment of psoriasis is scored on a 5 -point scale, reflecting a global 
consideration of the ery thema, induration and scaling across all psoriatic lesions.  Average 
erythema, induration and scaling are rated separately  over the whole bod y according to a
5-point severity  scale, scored from 0 to 4, with appropriate morphologic descriptors.  The 
severit y rating scores are summed and the average taken –
the total average is rounded to the 
nearest whole number score to determine the PGA (See Appendix 8).
The 5 -
point scale for PGA is: 0, “clear”; 1, “almost clear”; 2, “mild”; 3, “moderate”; 
4“severe”.
7.2.4. Body Surface Area (BSA)
Assessment of bod y surface area involved in psoriasis is performed separately for four areas 
of the bod y: head, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs.  The percentage surface area affected 
by [CONTACT_153852] “handprint method”, where the full hand of the 
subject (ie, the subject’s flat hand, thumb and fingers) represents approximately  1% of the 
total BSA22and a set percentage of each of the four areas of the bod y:
1handprint corresponds to approximatel y 10% of the head/neck.
1handprint corresponds to approximatel y 5% of the arm/upper limbs .
1 handprint corresponds to approximatel y 3.3% of the trunk.
1handprint corresponds to approximatel y 2.5% of the lower limbs.

Page 57The extent (%) to which each of the four areas of the body is affected is captured on the CRF 
(to 2 decimal places, as necessary).  A weighting factor is applied to each of the four areas in calculation of the total body surface area affected: head x0.1; upper limbs x0.2; trunk x0.3; lower limbs x0.4, as the four areas correspond to approximately 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of the total BSA, respectively.
22  The sum of the weighted percent involvement obtained for 
each of the four body areas is the overall psoriatic BSA.
7.2.5. Target Lesion and Regional Photography (at select study centers)
Standardized digital photographs of target lesions and surrounding region photography will 
be taken at selected study sites using a professional quality digital camera.  These photographs are for illustrative purposes only.
Regional Photography : Regional photographs of each target lesion and surrounding area 
will also be taken at select study centers.  Once the camera/lens is set at the appropriate magnification, proper focusing technique will help ensure that photographs are all taken from the same set distance from the camera.  Photographs will be taken in duplicate with lighting, framing, and exposure held constant.
Digital study images will be captured on memory cards.  The contents of those cards will be 
uploaded to Canfield Scientific, Inc. using Canfield’s secure, compliant website.  All study images received will be monitored and archived in a fully validated, 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) compliant system.  A copy of each subject's Week [ADDRESS_177521] file in order to confirm the location/field of view to be photographed at the end of treatment.  Photography will be performed at Week 0, Week 4, Week 12/Early Termination, and follow-up visit Week 16/ Early Termination.  Additional instructions related to target lesion and Regional Photography can be located in the study manual.
7.3. Patient Reported Outcomes
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) data will be collected using the

8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety  events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; 
(2)non-serious ad verse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under 
study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure.
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report 
Form  to [COMPANY_007] Safety Within 
24Hours of Awareness
SAE All All
Non-serious AE All None
Exposure to the investigational 
product under study during 
pregnancy or breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether 
associated with an AE), except 
occupational exposureExposure during pregnanc y, 
exposure via breastfeeding, 
occupational exposure (regardless 
of whether associated with an AE)
All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as desc ribed in the following 
paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report 
Form within [ADDRESS_177525] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available 
event information.  T his time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for class ification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may  be 
requested b y [COMPANY_007] Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is more detai led than that recorded on the CRF .  In general, this will include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of 
the case and independent determination of possible causalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the e vent, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  An y pertinent additional information must be reported o n the CT SAE 

PF-06700841
B7931004
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 13 February 2017
Page 64Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is 
determined b y the sp onsor to be serious will be reported by  [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the A E page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the stud y subject/legally acceptable representative.  In addition, each stud y 
subject/le gally  acceptable representative will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a 
non-leading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject 
Withdrawal /Early Termination section)
Withdrawal due to AEs sh ould be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF.
When a subject withdraws from the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.
8.1.4.
Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_177526].
For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.

PF-06700841
B7931004
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 13 February 2017
Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active c ollection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investigator, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the 
CRF.
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_47610] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determin ation of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whet her or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality
 assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to i nvestigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records.
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.

PF-[ADDRESS_177527] or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal re lationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to:
Abnormal test findings.
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms .
Changes in physical examination findings.
Hypersensitivity .
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease .
Drug abuse .
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose .
Drug withdrawal .
Drug misuse.
Drug interactions.
Extravasation.
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP) .
Exposure via breastfeeding.
Medication error .
Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following 
conditions are met:
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or

PF-06700841
B7931004
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 13 February 2017
Page 67Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing (outside of any  protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not requ ire 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death.
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death) .
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153830] .
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions).
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical a nd scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event m ay jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchosp asm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4589] (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153831] e facility , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a

however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit is assessed for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation f acilities.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593].
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief) .
Skilled nursing facilities.
Nursing homes.
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi [INVESTIGATOR_74039].  Examples include:
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality ).
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep).
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination) .
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  [CONTACT_8896]) .
Optional admiss ion not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery ).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE .
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject .
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it mee ts the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.

PF-06700841
B7931004
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 13 February 2017
Page 698.3.Severity Assessment
If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes of 
consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with sub ject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necess arily an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  by [CONTACT_74096], and will be handled as SAEs in 
the safet y database.
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors” .  In some subjects, transaminase elevatio ns are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outcome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly  referred to as drug
-induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible”.
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample).  
In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteri a outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury 
have been excluded.

PF-[ADDRESS_177528]’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available.
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baselin e:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value by [CONTACT_8895] 1 × ULN orif the value reaches 
>3×ULN (whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to wh
ether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_177529] and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl 
transfe rase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
antic oagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetamin ophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, s urgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted.

PF-[ADDRESS_177530]/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 
cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all resul ts of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.3. Potential Cases of Decreased eGFR
In FIH stud y B7931001, blood creatinine elevation was reported across dose levels in health y 
volunteer and psoriasis patients ( Section 1.5.1).
Abnormal values in serum creatinine concurrent with absence of increase in blood urea 
nitrogen ( BUN )that meet the below criteria, in the absence of other causes of kidney  injur y, 
are considered potential cases of acute kidney  injury  and should be considered important 
medical events.
An increase in serum creatinine above the upper limit of normal (ULN) as defined b y the 
laboratory  reference range should trigger a reflex testing f or serum cy statin -C in order to 
facilitate both cy statin C based and serum creatinine based eGFR calculations.
Based on these measurements, estimated GFR using serum creatinine and serum cy statin C 
will be determined at the time of elevation in serum creat inine above ULN.  All subjects will 
also have serum creatinine based and serum cy statin -C based eGFR calculated at baseline 
upon entry  into the study.
If an individual subject demonstrates a CONCOMITANT serum creatinine based AND 
serum cy statin C based eGF R decline of 
30% compared to the subject’s baseline eGFR, 
then the subject should not be further dosed and adequate, immediate, supportive measures 
including immediate evaluation by a nephrologist (preferably within 24 hours) with 
appropriate management and treatment as clinically  indicated. Results should be repeated 
as indicated b y the nephrologist or weekly at a minimum until the eGFR returns to baseline 
15% or the renal parameters are deemed to be stable b y the nephrologist and/or PI.
If the subject cannot be seen by a nephrologist within 24 hours (as described above), 
then the subject should be sent to a local emergency room for evaluation and treatment 
as clinically indicated.
Subjects should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as s oon as possible, 
preferably within 24-48 hours from awareness of the abnormal eGFR result for a safety  
follow -up visit .  This evaluation should include laboratory  tests, detailed history , and 
physical assessment.  In addition to repeating serum creatinine and serum cy statin C, 
laboratory  tests should also include: serum BUN, serum CK, serum electroly tes (including at 
a minimum potassium, sodium, phosphate/phosphorus, calcium), in addition to urine 
dipstick, urine microscopic examination, and urinary  indices.  All cases confirmed on repeat 

PF-06700841
B7931004
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 13 February 2017
Page 72testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria for acute kidney  injury , with no other cause(s) of 
laboratory  abnormalities identified should be considered as potential cases of drug -induced 
kidney  injury  irrespective of availab ility of all the results of the investigations performed to 
determine etiolog y of the abnormal serum creatinine.
All relevant test results will be forwarded to [COMPANY_007] for review immediatel y upon receipt by 
[CONTACT_978] .
This requirement applies to all subjects, all cohorts.
8.4.4. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product.
An example of environmental e xposure would be a case involving direct contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental expo sure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the investigational pr oduct, the investigator must report this information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an AE h as occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).

PF-06700841
B7931004
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 13 February 2017
Page 73Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplementa l form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrity  of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrity  of the terminated fetus should be assessed by  [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnan cy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Addi tional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows:
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion .
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_177531].
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requ
ested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the subject with the Pr egnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeedi ng
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is n ot created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported to gether with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.

PF-06700841
B7931004

Page 74An occupational exposure is reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the informatio n does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.5. Medication Errors
Other exposures to the investigational produ ct under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors.

Report Form  to [COMPANY_007] Safety 
Within 24 Hours of Awareness
Medication errors All (regardless of whether 
associated with an AE)Only if associated with an SAE
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.
Medication errors inclu de:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product .
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if 
applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and non -serious, are recorded on an AE page of the 
CRF.
Medication errors should be repo rted to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within [ADDRESS_177532] SAE Report 
Form only when associated with an SAE .
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
is outlined here and further detailed in a s tatistical analysis plan(SAP) , which will be 
maintained by  [CONTACT_456].  The SAP may modify  what is outlined in the protocol where 
appropriate ; however, any  major modifications of the primary  endpoint definition s or their 
analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.

PF-[ADDRESS_177533] deviation of 10, a total of 200 randomized 
subjects in the 8 treatment groups will provide approximately  95% power to detect a 
-11.8 placebo adjusted PASI  change from baseline at Week 12 (difference between 
PF-06700841 and placebo) at significance level of 0.05 (one-sided) using Dunnet test for 
multiplicity  adjustment. Approximately  160 completers (20 completers per treatment group) 
can be achieved with an assumption of 20% dropout rate.
9.2.Efficacy Analysis
The primary  anal ysis is based on the classic PASI scores described in the sample size
determination section.
Analy sis of efficacy  endpoints will be performed for the modified intent- to-treat (mITT)
population, defined as all randomized subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_177534].
All analy ses will be detailed in the Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) .
9.2.1. A nalysis of the Primary Endpoint 
The primary  endpoint is the change from baseline in PASI  score at Week 12.Thetreatment 
effect in each of the active treatment groups is defined as the placebo adjusted change from 
baseline of the PASI score at Week 12 (mean change from baseline at Week 12 in the active 
treatment group minus the mean change from baseline at Week 12 in the placebo group).   
The estimates for treatment effect will be obtained by [CONTACT_153853] -effect models
repeated measures (MMRM) assumin g missing at random to the PASI  change from baseline 
score. The model will include treatment (active doses and placebo), visit, treatment by  [CONTACT_153854] a covariate. We will allow an unstructured 
variance -cova riance matrix. Covariance matrices with other structure will be considered in 
sensitivity  anal ysis.Estimates and the appropriate confidence intervals will be presented.
All [ADDRESS_177535] will b e used 
for multiplicity  adjustment.
Analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be implemented as sensitivity  analy sis. This 
additional estimate of the treatment effect relies on the subset of observations (Week 12 and 
baseline). It is potentially less efficien t than the estimate based on the MMRM but eliminates 
the complexity  of modeling the covariance between the repeated measures of outcome 
observed at different visits. Estimates and the appropriate confidence intervals will be 
presented for each of these me thods.
The linear PASI (L -PASI) score will be anal yzed as additional sensitivity  analy sis using 
MMRM and ANCOVA.
In addition to the primary  analy sis based on the evaluating contrasts of the treatment effects, 
data permitting, dose- response relationship for the primary  endpoint may  be explored.

Page 769.2.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Binary endpoints (ie, proportions of subjects achieving 50%,75% and 90% reduction from
baseline PASI response rates and proportions of subjects with Physician Global Assessmentof ‘clear’ or “almost clear”) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_34055] a proportion of subjects with theevent of interest in each of the treatment groups at each visit. Estimate and 90% confidence interval for the difference of proportions (each of the active doses against placebo) will be calculated, using normal approximation to the distribution of the observed difference inproportions.
Logistic regression/odds ratio modeling approach will be employed as a sensitivity analysis
unless the proportion of the events in one of the groups is too small for the applicability ofthis method.

Nominal p-values (Tier 1 events only) and 95% confidence intervals (Tier 1 and Tier 2
events) will be provided for between treatment differences in the percentage of subjects withevents. Reporting p-values and confidence intervals will follow [COMPANY_007] standard practice inthe 3-tier approach.
 
9.8. Data Monitoring Committee
This study will use an internal review committee (IRC).
The IRC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the  and safety of 
subjects in the study according to the Charter. The recommendations made by [CONTACT_153857]. [COMPANY_007] will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate.
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
[COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This verification may also occur after study completion.CCI

PF-[ADDRESS_177537] and/or after study  completion, the investigator site may  be subject to 
review b y the IRB/EC ,and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or companies 
working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_8901].
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspec tion 
notification in relation to the study .Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its 
agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspecti on.  The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and the subject's medical records.  The investigator will promptly  provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_153832].  Before response submission to the regulatory  
authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity  to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant perso nnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should b
e understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole pr opert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y
,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring th at they  are accurate, authentic /original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timel y (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_110292]. Any correcti ons to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153833].  In these 
cases , data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may  also serve as 
the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at [COMPANY_007] that clearl y identifies those data that 
will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF wil l stand as the source document.

PF-[ADDRESS_177538] Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/ audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg,CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent [/assent] documents , copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety reporting forms, source 
documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of 
relevant corr espondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The 
records should be retained by  [CONTACT_52248] I CH guidelines, according to 
local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618].
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_177539] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator f ile.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory  
requirements, and the general pri nciples set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for 
Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of 
Medical Sciences 2002), ICH Guideline for G ood Clinical Practice , and the Declaration of 
Helsinki .

maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of subjects’ personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document sand an y subject recruitment materials must be in 
compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements, including 
applicable privacy  laws .
The i nformed consent document s used during the informed consent process and an y subject 
recruitment materials 
must be reviewed and approved by  [CONTACT_4618] , approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC

The investigator must ensure that each study  subject ,or his or her legall y acceptable 
representative is fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible 
risks associated with participation.
Whenever consent is obtained from a subject’s legally  acceptable representative, the 
subject’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the subject has 
the capacity
 to provide assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  If the investigator determines 
that a subject’s decisional capacit y is so limited he/she cannot reasona bly be cons ulted, then, 
as permitted b y the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory  and legal requirements, the 
subject’s assent may  be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not 
obtained.  If the stud y subject does not provide hisor herown consent, the source documents
must record why the sub ject did not provide consent (eg
, minor, decisionally  impaired adult), 
how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the subject’s legal ly 
acceptable representative, t he consent signer’s relationship to the study  subject (eg, parent, 
spouse) ,
and that the subject’s assent was obtained or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y,
it must be documented in the source documents.
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject or the subject's legall y acceptable representative before an y 
study -specific activity  is performe d. The investigator will retain the original of each subject's 
signed consent document .

Appendix 3.1.Safety Monitoring
Subjects with the following laboratory  abnormalities require prompt retesting within one 
week (preferabl y within 48 hours) from awareness of the abnormal results:
Absolu
te neutrophil count <2000/mm3;
Hemoglobin <11.0 g/dL ;
Platelet count below <100,000/mm3.
Subjects with the following laboratory abnormalities require prompt retesting within 
72hours (but preferabl y within 48 hours) from awareness of the abnormal results:
Serum creatinine >upper limit of normal (UL N).
If serum creatinine > ULN (see protocol Section 7.1.3 and Section 8.4.3), 
measure ment of serum cy statin C (reflex testing) will occur along with eGFR 
calculation.  Decision to discontinue dosing will be based on eGFR, as described 
below in Appendix 3.2.
For women of childbearing potential (an y female subjec t who does not meet at least 
one of the criteria of non -childbearing potential listed in Section 4.1) with any  
positive or indeterminate point -of-service urine -hCG test or with a missed 
mens trual period, the subject will have study  drug interrupted and a serum sample 
submitted to the central laboratory  for -hCG testing. A subject may  not progress 
further in the stud y unless pregnancy is ruled -out.
Additional individual subject safet y monito ring not specified in these guidelines is at the 
discretion of the investigator and dependent on any  perceived safety  concerns. Unscheduled 
laboratory  testing through the central laboratory  may  be obtained at any  time during the study  
to assess such conce rns, and a subject may  be withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the 
investigator.

PF-[ADDRESS_177547] withdrawn from this 
study for:
Adverse Events:
Serious infections, defined as an y infecti on (viral, bacterial, and fungal) requiring 
parenteral antimicrobial therap y or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476], or meeting other 
criteria that require the infection to be classified as a serious adverse event.
Other serious or severe AEs, after consultation with the [COMPANY_007] clinician.
Potential Cases of Decreased eGFR :
If an individual subject demonstrates CONCOMITANT serum creatinine -based AND serum 
Cystatin C -based eGFR decline of 30% compared to the subject’s baseline eGFR, then the 
subject should not be further dosed and adequate, immediate, supportive measures including

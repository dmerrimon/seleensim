Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1IV. SYNOPSIS
Title of Study A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo- Controlled, Phase 3 Trial to Evaluate 
the Protective Efficacy and Safety of a Therapeutic Vaccine, ASP0113, in 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) -Seropositive Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190808], 
Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT)
Planned Study 
Period: Primary Study Period: From 3Q2013 to 3Q2017
Long- Term  Follow -up Period: until 1Q2022
Study O bjective s To evaluate the efficacy of ASP0113 compared with placebo as measured 
by a primary composite endpoint of overall mortality and CMV end organ 
disease (EOD) through [ADDRESS_226863] -transplant.
To evaluate the safety of ASP0113 in subjects undergoing allogeneic HCT. 
Planned T otal 
Number of S tudy 
Centers and 
LocationApproximately 90 sites globally 
Countries may include, but are not limited to, Australia, Belgium, Canada, 
[LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and United 
States
Design and 
MethodologyThis is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of approximately 
500 c ytomegalovirus (CMV) -seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190811], 
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_226864] 30% of subjects enrolled will be donor
CMV -seronegative.
The test compound will be a vaccine (ASP0113) which contains 2 plasmids 
encoding glycoprotein B (gB) and phosphoprotein 65 (pp65), each at 
2.5mg/mL, formulated with CRL1005 poloxam er and benzalkonium chloride 
(BAK).  The placebo control will be phosphate -buffered saline (PBS). 
Subjects will receive either 5 doses of ASP0113 or placebo on days -14 to -3, 
14-40, 60 ±5, 90 ±10 and 180 ±10 in relation to the day of transplant (donor cell 
infusion). 
The first injection must be given within [ADDRESS_226865] be ≥ [ZIP_CODE] mm3(spontaneously or after platelet 
transfusion) performed by [CONTACT_190887] 3days prior to all study 
drug injections. Prior to all study drug injections, confirmation must be made 
that there is no medical contraindication to an IMinjection. Results received in 
an equivalent local unit of measure must be converted to SI units.   Syringes will 
be masked prior to dosing to blind the subjects and all other per sonnel who need 
to remain blinded to the treatment assignment (i.e., site staff other than 
pharmacy personnel and staff designated to administer study drug injections). 
CMV plasma viral load will be monitored per the following schedule during the 
primary study period (through day 365/ V14): weekly ( ±2 days) during days 
0-100, every other week (± 5 days) during days 101-180, every 30 days
(±5 days) during days 181 -365. The CMV plasma viral loads will be performed 
by [CONTACT_2237]. CMV plasma viral load will also be performed by [CONTACT_190888] -specific antiviral therapy ( AVT ). 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_226866] weekly until the CMV -specific AVT is discontinued, at
which point, the regularly scheduled viral load assessments will resume. 
Note: CMV plasma viral loads may be performed at a local laboratory approved 
by [CONTACT_190889] . However, every time a 
viral load sample is sen t to the local laboratory a sample will also be sent to the 
central laboratory for confirmatory testing . Pre-emptive therapy may be started 
based on the central or local laboratory assessment and the subject’s clinical 
condition.
Adjudicated CMV -specific AVT will be assessed for subjects up to 1year 
following transplant through the primary study period (through day 365/ V14).
Immunologic response will be assessed in all subjects at V2, V5, V8, V9, V11 
and V14. If the visit coincides with a study drug adminis tration, the sample will 
be drawn prior to injection. 
In addition, if a CMV seropositive donor has consented and is participating in 
the optional donor cell sub -study, a [ADDRESS_226867] for CMV -specific T -cells.   For those donating peripheral 
stem cells, the donor blood sample is to be collected prior to the initiation of 
mobilization therapy (e .g., G- CSF).   This process is not applicable to sites in 
Japan.
Subjects will be evaluated for local reactogenicity and systemic signs 
for60minutes after each injection. Subjects will be directly observed for 
15minutes following the injection for any injection -related side effects, then 
remain in a designated area at the study site for 45 minutes so that side effects 
can be noted and treated, if necessary. Local reactogenicity will also be 
evaluated for each of the 7consecutive days following each injection beginning 
approximately 24 hours after the dose (day [ADDRESS_226868] dose). The assessments for 
each of the 7consecutive days following an injection will be done by [CONTACT_190890]. Wh en reactogenicity is reported as an AE, it 
must be followed until resolution or medically stable. All local reactions 
≥grade 3 [Appendix 7] require co nfirmation by a health care professional.
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_190891] 5.[ADDRESS_226869]-transplant for long -term safety related to the DNA vaccine.  Items to be 
assessed include mortality, development of any new/ rec urrent cancer, 
development of infection requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190812]/or induration at the injection sites [Appendix 20].  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from signing o f the informed consent 
through [ADDRESS_226870] 
dose of study drug is to be reported as an AE or SAE, as appropriate . 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be chartered to 
oversee safet y issues and futility  anal ysis.
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_226871] been 
randomized, and every 3 months thereafter until t he total enrollment reaches 
400subjects. Futility analyse s are based on the rate of CMV viremia defined as 
CMV plasma load ≥1000 IU/mL as assessed by [CONTACT_2237]. At each 
futility analysis, a Bayesian posterior probability that t he hazard ratio for 
viremia of the ASP0113 treatment group to the placebo treatment group will be 
less than 0.75 will be calculated. The study may stop for futility if this posterior 
probability is less than 0.15.
An Adjudication Committee (AC) will be cha rtered to adjudicate all cases of 
CMV EOD, initiation of CMV -specific AVT, and cause of death.

Statistical 
MethodsThis is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of approximately 
[ADDRESS_226887] sdied and 2 additional subjects experienced CMV 
EOD out of 40 treated with ASP0113, for an overall failure rate of 22.5%, 
while among the placebo subjects [ADDRESS_226888]
experienced CMV EOD out of 34, for an overall failure rate of 35.3%. 
To detect the estimated difference in mortality and CMV EOD from the phase 2 
study (35.3% vs. 22.5%), the study needs a sample size of at least 424 (212 per 
arm) to have 80% power at the 2-sided significance level of 0.050. A trial of 
size 500 (250 per arm) is expected to have 86% power for the composite 
endpoint.
The full analysis set (FAS) consists of all randomized subjects who receive at 
least 1dose of randomized study drug.
Efficacy analyses will be limited to the data obtained from time first of dose of 
study drug through the 1year post -transplant follow -up period. Data collected 
after the 1year post -transplant follow -up period for the long -term follow -up 
will not be included for the primary analysis of efficacy variables. 
Comparison be tween ASP0113 and placebo with respect to the primary 
endpoint will be performed using the Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel test stratified 
by [CONTACT_190893] (donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190817]). 
In a supportive analysis, time to first occur rence of aprimary endpoint event 
will be analyzed in a Cox proportional hazards model where the time-to-event 
will be calculated in days from transplant to the earliest of death or CMV EOD . 
Subjects not experiencing the primary endpoint event will be censored at the 
time of their last follow -up visit. The Cox model will include treatment and the 
stratification factors for randomization.
Key secondary endpoints of t imetofirst protocol defined CMV viremia 
through [ADDRESS_226889] adjudicated CMV -specific AVT 
through 1 year will each be compared between treatments using a Cox 
proportional hazards model with factors for treatment, donor- recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190818] ,and donor CMV serostatus.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 11 INTRODUCTION
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the Herpesviridae family that establishes latency  in host 
cells after acute infection. I mmunocompromised patients, including patients undergoing 
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), are particularly  vulnerable to CMV infection and 
reactivation. CMV infecti on is a risk factor for CMV end organ disease (EOD) , as well as a risk 
factor for acute graft- versus -host disease ( aGVHD ), chronic graft -versus -host disease ( cGVHD ), 
bacterial and fungal infections, and increased mortality . ASP0113 is a DNA vaccine designed to 
prevent CMV infection in immunocompromised hosts. I t contains [ADDRESS_226912]-transplant in the ASP0113 group as compared to the placebo group.
1.1 Back ground
Members of the Herpesviridae family  are a group o f viruses that includes the CMV, 
Epstein -Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex viruses and varicella zoster virus. Herpesviridae 
viruses are double -stranded DNA viruses that become latent in host cells after acute infection. 
CMV infection is ubiquitous and evid ence of seroconversion has been found in all populations. 
CMV infection is usually harmless, except in the fetus and immunocompromised hosts. I n the 
immunocompromised host, primary  infection, re -infection, and reactivation can cause 
significant morbidit y and mortality .
Persons undergoing HCT are particularl y susceptible to both primary infection and 
reactivation of CMV as a result of the interventions and drugs that ablate and suppress their 
immune sy stems. Patients with viremia that results from primary  infection or reactivation of 
CMV are at greatl y increased risk of CMV tissue -invasive disease and may also be at risk for 
mortality  not resulting from direct tissue invasion of CMV, aGVHD, cGVHD and non -CMV 
infections due to the immunomodulatory  effects of C MV [Cantoni et al, 2010; Boeckh & 
Ljungman, 2009] .
CMV tissue -invasive disease was the leading cause of death due to infectious disease among 
CMV -seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190823]  
(AVT) in the 1990s.  S ince the introduction of effective AVT, the mortality from CMV 
disease during the first [ADDRESS_226913] has been reduced from 20 -30% to less than 5% in 
most studies [Boeckh and Nichols, 2004].  However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_190824] -invasive disease related mortality , man y studies indicate that survival continues to be 
decreased in CMV -seropositive patients, suggesting an indirect effect of subclinical CMV 
infection on mortality  [Craddock et al, 2011; Yakoub -Agha et al, 2006; Boeckh & Ni chols, 
2004]. Mortality  related to CMV seropositivity  may  partially  result from an increase in 
aGVHD, cGVHD and infections other than CMV as these outcomes result in decreased 
survival and are associated with CMV infection and CMV seropositivity  in the rec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_190825] [Srinivasin et al, 2012; Cantoni et al, 2010; Larsson et al, 2004; Nichols et al, 2002]. 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_226914] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190826] -mediated immune responses. I t contains 2 plasmids which encode CMV 
glycoprotein B (gB) and tegument phosphoprotein 65 (pp65). gB is the major neutralizing 
target for antibodies stimulated by  [CONTACT_190901] [Britt et al, 1990]; pp65 is 1of 
the proteins most frequently  recognized by  [CONTACT_398]8+and CD4+cells in healthy  humans [Kern et 
al, 2002; Gy ulai et al, 2000; Wills et al, 1996]. ASP0113 appears to be both effective and 
safe and therefore warrants further stud y.
1.[ADDRESS_226915] Composition
Plasmid DNA (pDNA) is covalentl y closed, circular, double -stranded DNA molecules that 
are engineered to encode protective antigens from infectious disease pathogens. This 
platform technology  provides an ideal approach for treating immunocompromised subjects 
because it eliminates the safet y concerns engendered by [CONTACT_190902]. In addition, a pDNA 
vaccine is delivered without other viral genes that may  be involved in evasion of the immune 
system; ASP0113 does not include CMV -encoded genes involved in the downregulation of 
major histo -compatibility  complex (MHC) molecules, production of chemokine receptors, or 
mimics of cy tokines [Mocarski, 2002].
ASP0113 is a bivalent product that consists of 2 separate pDNAs each containing a 
codon -optimized CMV gene. Phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) is included to induce CD4+ and 
CD8+ T -cell responses; gB is included to induce antibodies. The plasmids are formulated 
with CRL [ADDRESS_226916] injection, plasmid was present at the bone marrow and the injection site, howev er, 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_226917] 2016 Astellas Page 36of 136
Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1their cop y numbers were reduced b y approximately  596-fold and 76- fold, respectivel y, 
compared to day  3. No genomic integration of the pDNA was observed 2 months after 
vaccination.   
Administration of ASP0113 as a single dose is well -tolerated and results in no demonstrable 
clinical signs of toxicity  due to injection of vaccine. Repeat dose administration of ASP0113 in 
rabbits is well-tolerated, with no drug-related changes in clinical signs. However, vaccination 
with ASP0113 did lead to a significant, but reversible, increase in creatine phosphokinase 
(CPK ) and minimal to moderate inflammation of the muscle, skin and subcutis, that persisted 
to a slight degree in the recovery period. Based on these nonclinical a nimal studies, ASP0113 
is considered safe and well -tolerated, is not anticipated to present a toxicity  risk in humans 
when delive red by  [CONTACT_52596] , and immunogenicity  data suggest that vaccination can induce 
immune responses to human CMV. For a detailed summary  of the nonclinical studies please 
refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
1.3.2 Clinical Data
To date, ASP0113 has been evaluated in a phase 1 study in health y volunteers and a phase 2 
study  of matched related donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190827].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1 (VCL -CB01- 101) Results
The first clinical stud y of ASP0113 was a multicenter, randomized, ope n-label phase 1 clinical 
study  (VCL -CB01 -101) designed to evaluate the safet y and i mmunogenicity  of ASP0113 in 44
healthy  adult CMV -seropositive and CMV -seronegative volunteers at doses of either 1 mg or 
5mg IMadministered on weeks 0, 2, and 8 in a dose escalation format and at a dose of 5 mg 
IMadministere d on day s 0, 3, 7 and 28 (accelerated schedule)[Wloch et al, 2008].
Overall ASP0113 was safe and well -tolerated. Volunteers receiving the higher dose or 
accelerated vaccine schedule tended to experience more local reactogenicity , but the severity  
of the treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs )did not increase with increasing dose an d 
a more compressed schedule. The incidence of local reactogenicit y, predominantly  injection 
site pain, was 62.5% for the lowest weekly  dose group , 87.5% for the highest weekly  dose 
group, and 100% forthe acc elerated schedule group . Several cutaneous TEAEs were 
considered related to ASP0113 by  [CONTACT_190903], rash and pruritus. 
One volunteer did experience a transient incre ase in CPK value greater than 5 x the upper 
limit of nor mal (UL N), but less than [ADDRESS_226918] ex -vivo interferon γ (IFN -γ)enzy me-linked 
immunosorbent spot assay  for T -cell responses to pp65. At 16 weeks, antibody  and/orcell 
responses were elicited in 38% and 50% of the CMV- seronegative volunteers adm inistered 
1mg and 5 mg ASP0113, respectivel y. CMV -seropositive volunteers had increases in pp65 
T-cell responses of 12.5% and 37.5% across all groups, but no increase in gB antibod y levels 
were detected for CMV -seropositive volunteers.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment [IP_ADDRESS] Phase 2 (CB01- 202) Results
The second clinical study of ASP0113 was a mult icenter, randomized, double -blind phase [ADDRESS_226920] for the treatment of he matologic disorders [Kharfan- Dabaja, 2012] . A total 
of 108 subjects were enrolled in the study , including 14 donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_91582], and received at 
least 1 dose of stud y drug [5 mg/mL (1 mL dose)] or placebo. Recruitment of donor/
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190828] y in the study so that arm was dis continued; 
theresults are not discussed here. The intent -to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) populations 
comprise 80 and 74 trans plant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], respectively .Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190829] -5 to -3, 21 to 42 (1 injection in this window, health permitting), on day

therap y was i nitiated for a lower percentage of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190830]0113 group 
(47%) than in the placebo group (61.8%), but the difference was not statistically  significant 
(P = 0.145 , Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel [CMH] test stratified by [CONTACT_3725] ). The PP population was 
modified for this anal ysis to exclude 2subjects who received CMV -specific AVT because of 
false positive results from the local viral load assay ).  
When t he occurrence of CMV viremia, as defined as ≥500 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  bya laboratory  
developed test (LDT) based upon the LightC ycler®polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) , was 
evaluated in a central laboratory , the rate was lower in the ASP0113 group (33%) than in the 
placebo group (62%) and was statistically  significant ( P = 0.008, CMH test stratified by  [CONTACT_3725]). 
Post-hoc anal yses of the phase [ADDRESS_226922] been 
reported to be associated with CMV infection may be reduced as a result of vaccination with 
ASP0113, including mortality , aGVHD and cGVHD. For the clinical endpoints of aGVHD, 
cGVHD, and mortality  and a composite of CMV EOD, aGVHD, cGVHD and mortality , the 
observed rate for ASP0113 was lower than the corresponding obser ved rate for placebo, 
although the differences were not statisticall y significant [ Table 3].

Immune responses to the 2 immunogens, gB and pp65, encoded in the vaccine were assessed 
by 2immunoassay s: 1) a gB-specific IgG -binding ELISA; and 2) an ex vivo pp65- specific 
IFN-γ ELISPOT [Kharfan- Dabaja, 2012]. T -cell responses to CMV pp65 and gB as well as 
gB-specific serum antibody  levels were similar in the ASP0113 and placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190832] y and transplant. The CMV pp65 T- cell responses were numerically  
enhanced in the ASP0113 group relative to the placebo grou p at all post -transplant times

between the longitu dinal gB antibody  responses (P = 0.749).
Overall the vaccine appears to be safe and well -tolerated. The incidence of local reactogenicit y 
was higher in the ASP0113 group than in the placebo group (22.9% and 10.9%, respectively ), 
primarily  due to injection site pain. Fatalities were reported for 20.8% recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190836]0113 group and 32.6% recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190837] [ADDRESS_226927]’s genome is negligible 
per FDA regulatory  guidance and induction of autoimmunity  is unlikely . No sy stemic organ 
toxicity  was noted. There was no local reactogenicity  reported, but in the highest dose groups 
in a repeated- dose toxicity  study  in rabbits, there was histologic evidence of inflammation in 
the muscles injected with vaccine and concurrent elevati ons in CPK.  
In the phase 1 and phase 2 clinical studies the vaccine was safe and well -tolerated. One healthy  
volunteer had a transient elevation in CPK (> 5x normal but < 10x normal). L ocal (injection 
site) reactions including pain, induration, ery thema, pruritus, discomfort and swelling were 
reported more frequently in the higher dosing group and more accelerated schedule with

through 1year post -transplant. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_190840]- invasive 
disease related mortality , many  studies indicate that survival continues to be decreased in 
CMV -seropositive patients, suggesting an indirect effect of subclinical CMV infection on

Some publications have suggested that mortality  related to CMV seropositivity  may  partiall y 
result from an increase in aGVHD, cGVHD and infections other than CMV as these outcomes 
result in decreased survival and are associated with CMV infection and CMV seropositivity  in 
the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55060] [Srinivasin et al, 2012; Cantoni et al, 2010; Larsson et al, 2004; Nichols 
et al, 2002] .
A key  secondary  endpoint is CMV viremia. CMV viremia will be protocol -defined as CMV 
plasma viral load of ≥ 1000 IU/mL as assessed b y the central laboratory through [ADDRESS_226935] -transplant .
CMV plasma viral load will be monitored per the following schedule during the primary  
study period (th rough day  365/V14): weekl y (±2 day s) during day s 0-100, every  other week
(± 5 days) during day s 101 -180, every  30 day s (±5 day s) during day s 181-[ADDRESS_226936] weekl y
until the CMV -specific AVT is discontinued, at which point, t he regularly scheduled plasma 
viral load assessments will resume.
Note: CMV plasma viral loads may  be performed at a local laboratory  approved b y the 
Sponso r and at the discretion of the Investigator. However, every  time a viral load sample is 
sent to the local laboratory a sample will also be sent to the central laboratory for 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_226937]’s clinical condition.
As [ADDRESS_226938] adhere to the procedures defined below as a condition of participation in 
the trial.
●The local pp65 antigenemia results must be e ntered i nto the eCRF database within 
72hours (or next business day ) of receipt to facilitate in -time monitoring of results.
●The Medical Monitor must be called within 48 hours (or next business day) if the pp65 
antigenemia test is positive and the central laboratory  PCR viral load result is negative .
●Both the pp65 antigenemia and the central laboratory test must be repeated within 
48hours if the local pp65 antigenemia result is positive, the central laboratory  PCR viral 
load result is negative and the subject is treated with CMV -specific AVT.
The plasmids in the study  vaccine may  interfere with certain PCR assay s.If a PCR assay  is 
used that amplifies the genes UL55/gB or UL83/pp65, this could result in either a false 
positive viral load or unblinding of the stud y subject.
Sites that aredetermined to have unacceptable PCR assay  in their local laboratory but were 
able to determine a Sponsor deemed acceptable work practice flow for utilizing another 
acceptable local assay  or methodology  will be allowed to pa rticipate in the trial .
Note:   Local CMV plasma viral load testing may be performed onl y at a local laboratory 
approved b y the Sponsor.
Adjudicated CMV -specific AVT will be assessed for subjects up to 1 year following transplant 
through the primary  study  period (through day  365/ V14).
Immunologic response will be assessed in all subjects atV2, V5 , V8, V9, V11 and V14. If the 
visit coincides with a study  drug administration, the sample will be drawn prior to injection. 
In addition, if a CMV seropositive donor has consented and is participating in the optional 
donor cell sub- study , a 20mL peripheral blood sample from the donor will be obtained prior 
to the stem cell donation for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190843] -specific 
T-cells. For those donating peripheral stem cells, the donor blood sample is to be collected 
prior to the initiation of mobilization therapy  (e.g. ,granulocy te colon y stimulating factor 
[G-CSF]).
Subjects will be evaluated for local reactogeni city and sy stemic signs and sy mptoms for 
60minutes (±10 minutes) after each injection. Subjects will be directl y observed for 
15minutes following the injection for an y injection -related side effects, then remain in a 
designated area at the study  site for 45 minutes so that side effects can be noted and treated, if 
necessary . Local reactogenicity  will also be evaluated for each of the 7consecutive day s 
following each injection beginning approximately 24 hours after the dose (day  1-[ADDRESS_226939] dose). 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_226940] be 
followed until resolution or medicall y stable. All local reactions ≥ Grade 3 [ Appendix 7] 
require confirmation b y a h ealth c are professional.
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_190891] 5.[ADDRESS_226941] -transplant

and available patient records include mortality , development of an y new/recurrent cancer, 
development of infection requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190844], a nd ery thema and/or 
induration at the injection sites [ Appendix 20].  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from signing of the informed consent through [ADDRESS_226942] dose of study  drug is to be reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate . 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be chartered to oversee safet y 
issues and futility  anal ysis. 
An Adjudication Committee (AC) will be chartered to adjudicate all cases of CMV EOD, 
initiation of CMV -specific AVT, and cause of death.

schedule prepared b y the Sponsor or designee prior to the start of the study . (Refer to 
[Section 4.5]).
Only  the pharmacist and designated staff, including the person(s) injecting the vaccine will 
be unblinded to treatment. All other study  site staff will remain blinded to subjects’ treatment 
assignment. The s yringes will be masked prior to dosing to maintain the bli nd for subjects 
and all other personnel . Details regarding stud y blinding will be described in the Pharmacy

when critical therapeutic decisions are contingent on knowing the assigned study  drug ( refer 
to [Section 4.4.3] ). 
Withdrawal of a subject from the study  [Section 3.5] is not a sufficient reason to break the 
study  blind. The onl y reason to break the blind is whether the information gained materiall y 
alters the subsequent care of the subject. The reason to break the blind must be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind. After receiving authorization for 
unblinding from the Sponsor , the Investigator will uti lize the I RT to unblind the subject’s 
treatment assignment.  Unblinding through the interactive s ystem may  only be done b y 
designated individuals at the site (ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_190847] b y the 
Sponsor ).As treatment assignment infor mation for each subject will be kept in the site’s 
pharmacy  records, if for some reason access to the I RT is not available the Investigator may 
obtain this information from the Pharmacist or designee. If the clinician breaking the blind is 
unable to reach the Medical Monitor and an urgent safet y issue with direct impact on patient 
care decisions warrants this action, the blind may  be broken, but the Medical Monitor must 
be informed as soon as possible after the blind is broken.
If the blind is broken for a subject, the reason is to be documented as a written entry  in the 
source document. Key  information will be recorde d at the time the blind is broken and 
entered in the subject’s e lectro nic case report form (eCRF ). This includes the subject number, 
date the blind was broken, the reason, the person who requested the breaking of the blind, the 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_226968]’s treatment assignment, 
may be done onl y for reasons relating to subject safet y or when critical therapeutic decisions 
are contingent upon knowing the blinded stud y drug assignment. As noted in [Section 4.4.2],
the only  reason to break the blind is whether the information gained materially  alters the 
subsequent care of the subject. The reason to break the blind must be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind. If the clinician breaking the blind is unable to 
reach the Medical Monitor and an urgent safety issue with direct impact on patient care 
decisions warrants this action, the blind may  be broken, but the Medical Monitor must be 
informed as soon as possible after the blind is broken.   
If it bec omes necessary  to break the code during the study , the date, time and reason will be 
collected in the subject’s eCRF and the appropriate source documents at the site .

provided to the limited staff w ho are empowered to break the codes for all S[LOCATION_003]R cases for
regulatory  reporting purpo ses.
4.5 Assignment and Allocation
At the screening visit, after the Informed Consent Form (ICF) has been signed, the subject 
will receive a subject number assignment through the IRT for use throughout the study . 
Subjects who subsequently  meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomly  assigned to receive either ASP0113 or placebo . The randomization to treatment
will be equally allocated (i.e., 1:1) and stratified by  [CONTACT_48919]- recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190848]. At least 30% of subjects enrolled will be donor- seronegative.
The IRT vendor will generate the randomization schedule. To obtain the ran domized 
treatment assignment for a subject , the pharmacist or designee will utilize an I RT, which is 
available [ADDRESS_226969] -14to-3 day sprior to the anticipated transplant day  (day  0). The first injection must be 
given within [ADDRESS_226970] and

5.5.3 Definition of SAEs
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any  of the following outcomes:
●Results in death.
●Is life threatening ( an AEis considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AEthat, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death).
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions. 
●Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect.
●Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28939] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476]/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious).
●Results in drug exposur e during pregnancy . 
●Other medicall y important events.
In this stud y, the day [ADDRESS_227009] or may  
require intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These 
events, including those that may result in disability /incapacit y, are also usually  considered 
serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an ER or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Safety  events of interest on the medicinal products administered to the subject as part of the 
study  (e.g., stud y drug, comparator, background therap y) that may  require expedited 
reporting and/or safet y evaluation include , but are not limited to:

pregnancy, last menstruation, estimated fertility  date, pregnancy  result, neonatal data, and 
any other clinicall y relevant information must be included, if available and if the mother has 
granted release of medical information.
The Investigator will follow the medical status of the mother ,as well as the fetus ,as if the 
pregnancy is an SAE and will report the outcome to the Sponsor /delegated CRO .
When the outcome of the pregnancy  falls under the criteria for SAE s (spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomal y [including anomaly in a 
miscarried fetus)], the Investigator must respond in accordance with the report procedure for 
SAE s.  Additional information regarding the ou tcome of a pregnancy  (which is categorized 
as an SAE ) is mentioned below.
●“Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion.
●Death of an infant within 1 month (30 day s) after birth must be reported as an SAE
regardless of its relati onship with the study  drug. 
●If an infant dies more than 1 month (30 day s) after the birth, it must be reported if a 
relationship between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as 
“possible” b y the Investigator .
●In the case of a de livery  of a living newborn, the “normality” of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth.

7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of approximately  500 subjects.
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum) for continuous endpoints, and 
frequency  and percentage for categorical endpoints. Statistical tests will be conducted using a 
significance level of 0.05. Con fidence intervals will be 95%, except were otherwise indicated.

died and 2 additional subjects experienced CMV EOD out of 40 treated with ASP0113, for 
an overall failure rate of 22.5 %.while among the placebo subjects [ADDRESS_227030] experienced CMV EOD out of 34, for an overall failure rate of 35.3%. 
To detect the estimated difference in mortalit y and CMV EOD from the phase 2 study 
(35.3% vs. 22.5%), the study  needs a sample size of at least 424 (212 per arm) to have 80% 
power at the 2- sided significance level of 0.050. A trial of size 500 (250 per arm) is expected 
to have 86% power for the composite endpoint.
All calculations are based on 1:1 randomization and used nQuery  Advisor 7.0.
7.2 Analysis Set
Prior to database lock, a Final Review of Data and TLFs Meeting will be held to allow a 
review of the clin ical trial data and to verify  the data that will be used for analy sis set 
classification. If required, consequences for the statistical anal ysis will be discussed and 
documented.  A meeting to determine anal ysis set classifications will also be held prior to 
database lock.
7.2.1 Safety Analysis Set 
The safet y analysis set ( SAF) consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose 
of randomized study  drug. Subjects will be included in anal yses using the SAF based on 
treatment actually  received.
The SAF will be used for summaries of demographic and baseline characteristics and 
analysis for all safet y and tolerability related variables .
7.2.2 Full Analysis Set 
The full anal ysis set (FAS) consists of all randomized subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_227031] treatment were given. The FAS

analysis of the efficacy  variables.
7.2.3 Per Protocol Set 
The per p rotocol set (PPS) includes all subjects of the FAS who have no major protocol 
violations. Criteria will be defined in the SAP.
Final judgments on exclusion of subjects from the PPS, based on protocol violations, are to 
be made at the Blind Data Review Meeting held prior to unblinding. 
The PPS will be used for secondary  analyses of efficacy  variables. Also, selected 
demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the PPS.

7.4 Analysis of Efficacy
7.4.1 Analysis of Primary Variable
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis
In order to compare the effect on the primary  composite endpoint between ASP0113 and 
placebo, the following null hy pothesis will be constructed:
H0: Odds Ratio = 1.
The accompan ying alternative hy pothesis is:
H1: Odds Ratio ≠ 1.
The [ADDRESS_227034] 
stratified by  [CONTACT_941] 2stratification factors for randomization ( donor- recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190861]). The effect of ASP0113 will be considered statistically  significant if 
the CMH rejects the null hy pothesis at the significance level of 0.050.   
Every  effort will be made to collect each subject’s stat us that will define the outcome of the 
primary  endpoint. For the primary  anal ysis, subjects with unknown survival status will be 
considered as having the primary  endpoint event.   
In addition, t he Breslow -Day test will be used to assess the consistency  of the odds ratio 
across the strata. In the event that the Breslow- Day test is significant at the 0.[ADDRESS_227035] w ill be provided for each stratum to assess the strength of 
possible treatment -by-strata interactions.

model.  The corresponding 95% CI for the effect will be presented. 
Efficacy  anal yses will be limited to the data obtained from time of first dos eof study  drug 
through the [ADDRESS_227037]-transplant follow -up period for the long -term follow -up will not be included for the 
primary  anal ysis of the primary  endpoint .
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Analysis for the Primary Endpoint
An anal ysis of the pr imary  endpoint will be repeated on the PPS . The method used for this 
analysis will be identical to the primary  anal ysisdescribed in [Section [IP_ADDRESS] ].Additional 
sensitivity  anal yses for the primary  endpoint will be conducted using onl y the subjects having 
complete follow -up through [ADDRESS_227038] -transplant and using alternative imputations of 
outcomes.
[IP_ADDRESS] Subgroup Analysis
The impact on treatment effect will be assessed b y a Breslow -Day test for each of the 
following factors:  a ge(less than study  median, greater than or equal to study  median) , race
(white, non- white), gender (male, female), subjects who had ATG as part of their 
conditioning regimen vs. those who did not, and myeloablative vs. non -myeloablati ve 
conditioning regimen. If the P value of Breslow -Day test is ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_227039] will be 
estimated for each strata of the subgroup.  
If enough donors are enrolled in the optional donor substudy  then subgroup anal yses by 
[CONTACT_48919] T -cell mediated immunity  will also be performed.
7.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Key Secondary Variables
A Cox proportional hazards model will be used to assess the effect on the time -to-first 
protocol -defined CMV viremia through [ADDRESS_227040] -transplant. Protocol- defined CMV 
viremia is defined as a CMV plasma load ≥1000 IU/mL  as assessed b y the central laboratory.  
The Cox model will contain the same terms as the 1 described above. Vaccine efficacy  will 
be estimated as:
VE = 1 –hazard ratio, and 95 % CI  will be provided.
To compare the treatment effect on protocol -defined CMV viremia between ASP0113 and 
placebo, the following null hy pothesis will be constructed:
H0: VE ≤ 20%.

The P value for the above hy pothesis tests will use a Wald statistic using the Cox model 
parameter estimate for the treatment effect, θ t:
Z = ( θt–ln(1- 20%))/S.E.( θt)
The 95% CI for VE will be calculated b y taking 1 minus the 95% CI  for the hazard ratio. 
Alternative h ypothesis will be accepted if the 95% CI  for VE excludes 20%.
The hazard rate of first adjudicated CMV- specific AVT through [ADDRESS_227042] for simple superiority  (0% efficacy  
margin) rather than use a 20% efficacy  margin.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 112.2 Appendix 2:  Definition of CMV Disease
Disease type Definition
CMV p neumonia Signs and/or symptoms of pulmonary disease combined with the detection of 
cytomegalovirus (inBAL fluid *)or lung tissue samples performed by [CONTACT_140175], histopathologic testing, immunohistochemical analysis, o r in situ 
hybridization   
(The presence of fungal copathogens such as Aspergillus species, together w ith 
radiologic signs typi[INVESTIGATOR_190871] [e.g.,a halo sign or a crescent 
sign]indicates fungal pneumonia rather than CMV pneumonia )
CMV g astrointestinal 
diseaseCom bination of clinical symptoms from the upper o r low er gastrointestinal tract, 
findings of macroscopic m ucosal lesions on endoscopy, and demonstration of
CMV infection (by [CONTACT_921], histopathologic testing, immunohistochemical 
analysis, or in situ hybridizations) in a gastrointestinal tract biopsy specimen. If 
CMV is detected in normal mucosa near a lesion consistent with thos e typi[INVESTIGATOR_190872], this can be accepted as CMV gastrointestinal disease.
CMV h epatitis Elevated bilirubin and/or enzyme levels during liver function testing, absence 
of other documented cause of hepatitis , and detection of CMV infection (by 
[CONTACT_921], histopathologic testing, immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ 
hybridization) in a liver biopsy specimen. Other pathogens, such as hepatitis C 
virus, may be present without excluding the diagnosis of CMV hepatitis.
CMV CNS disease CNS sym ptoms tog ether with the detection of CMV in cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_190873] , by [CONTACT_190951] , or in brain biopsy specimens, by [CONTACT_921], 
histopathologic testing, immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ hybridization.
CMV r etinitis Lesions typi[INVESTIGATOR_190874].
CMV nephritis CMV infection (by [CONTACT_921], immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ 
hybridization) together with the identification of histologi c features of CMV 
infection in a kidney biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with renal 
dysfunction.  Detection of CMV in the urine of a patient with kidney dysfunction 
does not fulfill the definition of CMV nephritis.
CMV cystitis CMV infection (by [CONTACT_921], immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ 
hybridization) together with the identification of conventional histologic features 
of CMV infection in a bladder biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with 
cystitis. Detection of CMV in urine combined with identification of symptoms 
does not fulfill the definition of CMV cystitis.
CMV myocarditis CMV infection (by [CONTACT_921], immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ 
hybridization) together with the identification of conventional histologic features 
of CMV inf ection in a heart biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with 
myocarditis.  
CMV pancreatitis CMV infection (by [CONTACT_921], immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ 
hybridization) together with the identification of conventional histologic features 
of CMV i nfection in a pancreatic biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with 
pancreatitis.  
Other CMV disease 
categoriesDefinitions for additional disease categories include the presence of compatible 
symptoms and signs and documentation of CMV by [CONTACT_190952].

Prior m alignancy (score 3): The presence of a prior diagnosis of any malignancy that required receiving a 
specific treatment  at any point in the patient’s past medical history except for the malignancy for which the 
patient is receiving the hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).  Patients with a prior malignancy from the same 
lineage of cells of the current malignancy should not be assigned a score for this c omorbidity (e.g. ,if a subject 
had a diagnosis of non -Hodgkin lymphoma that was preceded by [CONTACT_190958] a patient had a

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1Organ scoring of chronic GVHD. *AP may be elevated in growing children, and not reﬂective of liver dysfunction. 
†Pulmonary scoring is to be performed using both the symptom and PFT scale whenever possible, if performed based on 
symptoms.  When discrepancy exists between pulmonary symptom or PFT scores the higher value should be used for ﬁnal 
scoring. Scoring using the LFS is preferred, but if DLCO is not available, grading using FEV 1should be used. The LFS is a 
global assessment of lung function after the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans has already been established.  The percent
predicted FEV1 and DLCO (adjusted for hematocrit but not alveolar volume) should be converted to a numeric score as 
follows: >80% = 1; 70% -79% = 2; 60% -69% = 3; 50% -59% = 4; 40% -49% = 5; < 40% = 6. The LFS = FEV1 score + 
DLCO score, with a possible range of 2-12.

Drug -induced liver injury  (DILI) has been the most frequent single cause of safet y-related 
marketing withdrawals for the past [ADDRESS_227131] monitoring and expedited regulatory 
reporting of DILI during clinical trials are therefore required by  [CONTACT_1622] ( FDA Guidance,

The site is to complete the L iver Abnormality  Case Report Form (LA -CRF) or an appropriate 
document . Information collected will include the following:
●Diagnosis of condition causing the elevated LFTs
●Central and local laboratory  measurement of elevated LFTs (including AST, AL T, TBL ,

In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with marked hepatic laboratory  tests is not 
possible, drug must be discontinued.
DMC Monitoring
In addition to the above, the DMC will assess unblinded events between the ASP0113 and 
placebo groups to determine if there appears to be a signal that the frequency  or severit y of 
liver events is greater in ASP0113 than placebo or/and than that reported in the literature.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 112.19 Appendix 19:  Pharmacogenomics (PGx) Sub -Study
INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND
PGx research aims to provide information regarding how naturall y occurring changes in a 
subject’s gene and/or expression based on genetic variation may  impact what treatment options 
are best suited for the subject. Through investigation of PGx by  [CONTACT_190965][INVESTIGATOR_007], gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide Association Studies 
(GWAS), the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy  or toxicity  may  
be better understood. PGx research may  identify  which genes are involved in determining the 
way a subject may  or may  not respond to a drug.
STUDY OBJECTIVES
The PGx research that may  be conducted in the future with acquired saliva samples is 
exploratory . The objective of this research will be to analy zeor determine gene s of relevance 
to clinical response, and toxicity /safety  issues.
By [CONTACT_77816], it may  be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to ASP0113 in terms of efficacy  and/or toxicity .
STUDY POPULATION
Subjects who have consented t o participate in this study  may  also participate in the optional 
pharmacogenomics sub-study . As part of this sub- study , subjects must provide separate written 
informed consent prior to providing an y saliva samples that will be used at a later time for the 
pharmacogenomic analysis.
STUDY DESIGN
Site Sample Collection and Storage
Subjects who consent to participate in the PGx sub- study  will provide 1 saliva sample at
baseline (V2) prior to dosing. Each sample will be identified with a unique identifier. Samples
will be collected and shipped to the Sponsor designated central laboratory for prolonged 
storage. Detailed collection, storage, and shipment procedures will be included in the 
Laboratory  Manual for the study .
Central Laboratory and Research Laborat ory Processing and Storage / Sample Coding
Once received at the banking CRO, the samples will be assigned a unique sample code (second 
code) and stored frozen. A table linking the subject number (first code) with the newl y-
assigned sample code (second code ) will be kept by  [CONTACT_190966]. PGx anal ysis will be 
conducted using the second code onl y.
PHARMACOGENOMIC ANALYSIS
Details on the potential PGx analysis cannot be established y et. Astellas may  initiate the PGx 
analysis incase evidence suggests that ge netic variants may  be influencing the drug’s kinetics,

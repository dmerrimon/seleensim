 1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Title: A Prospective, Multi-Center, Single-Arm, Real-World Study Assessing 
the Clinical Use of the Bard® UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA Balloon 
Sponsor: Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc. 
[ADDRESS_1116680] Tempe, AZ [ZIP_CODE] 
Objectives: The objective of this study is to assess the clinical use of the Bard® 
UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon in a heterogeneous patient 
population in a real world, on-la bel clinical application. 
Design & 
Overview: This is a prospective, multi-center,  single-arm, real-world study to 
assess the clinical use of the Bard® UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA 
balloon for the treatment of stenotic lesions of the superficial femoral 
artery (SFA), popliteal artery, and in fra-popliteal arte ries (posterior 
tibial, anterior tibial and peroneal arteries). Follow-up for all treated subjects will be performed at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], [ADDRESS_1116681]-index procedure. 
Study Device: The UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon is a flexible, over the wire 
(OTW) catheter shaft with a semi-com pliant balloon fixed at the distal 
end. There are radiopaque markers to aid in visualization of the working 
length of the balloon during fluorosc opy. Two scoring wires, oriented 
180° apart provide focused force upon dilatation. 
The UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon is  compatible with .014” 
or .035” guidewires. Shaft sizes are either 130cm (.035”) or 150cm (.014”) and include the GeoAlign
® Marking System. 
Enrollment: A maximum of 350 subjects will be tr eated in the study. This will allow 
for approximately 175 subjects in an above the knee (ATK) cohort and 175 subjects in a below the knee (BTK ) cohort. Endpoint analysis will 
occur when all subjects have comp leted the [ADDRESS_1116682] index-procedure. 
Study Sites: Up to 35 investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US) will participate. 
Study 
Population: Male or non-pregnant female ≥ [ADDRESS_1116683] a lesion in the infra-popliteal arteries ( posterior tibial, anterior tibial or 
peroneal arteries).

 [ADDRESS_1116704]® UltraScore Study is a prospective, mu lti-center, single-arm, real-world study 
assessing the clinical use of the Bard® UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon for the 
treatment of stenotic lesions of the superficial femoral artery (SFA), popliteal artery, and infra-popliteal arteries.   This study will be conducted in conformance w ith the Declaration of Helsinki, Health 
Insurance Portability and A ccountability Act (HIPAA) requi rements, and Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) including 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, and 56. 
2.1 Background and Rationale 
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) occurs when  a narrowing, or blockage, develops in the 
arteries; PAD most commonly affects the legs. The primary cause of lower extremity PAD is 
atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis of the lower extremity arteries results in symptoms ranging from intermittent claudication (pain in the buttocks, thighs , or calf which occurs with 
exercise and relieves with rest) to pain at rest, and can ultimately progress to ulceration, 
gangrene and amputation. Percutaneous translum inal angioplasty (PTA) has long been the 
first step of treating a stenos ed artery. Other treatments ava ilable include atherectomy and 
other vessel preparation, and more recently, tr eatment with a drug coated balloon with or 
without stenting. 
2.2 Study Rationale 
This study is being done to provide physicians wi th real world data on the outcomes of use of 
the UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon, in cluding optimal PTA re sults and long-term 
freedom from clinical target lesion revascularization (TLR),  major amputation, and patency. 
For this study, optimal PTA results are those where ≤30% residual stenosis remains after use 
of the UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon. 
2.3 Device Description 
2.3.1 UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA Balloon
 
The UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon is  a flexible, over the wire (OTW) catheter 
shaft with a semi-compliant balloon fixed at th e distal end. There are radiopaque markers to 
aid in visualization of the working length of the balloon during fluoroscopy. Two scoring 
wires, oriented 180° apart provide  focused force upon dilatation. 
The UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon is compatible with .014” or .035” guidewires. 
Shaft sizes are either 130cm (.035”) or  150cm (.014”) and include the GeoAlign® Marking 
System.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
 
This study is a prospective, multi-center, sing le-arm, real-world study in the [LOCATION_002] 
assessing the clinical use of the UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon. 
 A maximum of 350 subjects will be treated in  the study. This will allow for approximately 
175 subjects in an above the knee (ATK) cohor t and 175 subjects in a below the knee (BTK) 
cohort. ATK subjects will be those that have a target lesion of the SFA or popliteal artery. 
BTK subjects will be those that ha ve a target lesion in infra-pop liteal arteries (posterior tibial, 
anterior tibial, and peroneal arteries). For this study, ATK ar teries (SFA and popliteal) will 
end at the takeoff of the first tibial artery.
 
 
Treated subjects will be followed for [ADDRESS_1116706] completed the 12 month follow up. No site will be allowed to 
enroll more than 20% of the overall number of  subjects to ensure the study be reasonably 
well–balanced.  The UltraScore device has been cleared for use by [CONTACT_941] F.D.A. The use of UltraScore will be 
done within the indications for use found in the product IFU. A duplex ultrasound (DUS) will 
be done at [ADDRESS_1116707] of care procedures, including:

(posterior tibial, anterior tibia l, and peroneal arteries). Fo r this study, ATK arteries (SFA 
and popliteal) will end at the ta keoff of the first tibial artery. 
Lesions that cross from ATK to BTK may not be treated as the study target lesion. 
Diffuse lesions will be considered separate lesions if there is [ADDRESS_1116722]. 
If an angiographically acceptable result cannot  be obtained after two inflations of the 
UltraScore™ balloon (>30% residual stenosis ), the subject should be considered a 
treatment failure. Subjects will continue to be  seen at the protocol specified follow-up 
time points. 
6.2.1 Adjunctive Treatment of the Target Lesion 
Adjunctive treatment of the target lesion befo re or after use of th e UltraScore™ balloon 
as part of standard of care pr ocedures is allowed. All adjunctive treatments of the target 
lesion will be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Care should be taken to limit stent usage in the study lesion. Bail out stenting a nd stenting of non-study lesions is acceptable 
at any time.

 Final run (after adjunctive treatment), with 1 vessel run-off 
All angiography shall be performed using the identical angles , magnification and 
angiographic technique as described in the “Angiography Guidelines” supplied by [CONTACT_807988].  It is important to use a calibrated measurement ruler so that the 
Angiographic Core Lab may properly assess  the target lesion characteristics (e.g., 
location, reference vessel diameter, lesion diameter and length).  Properly labeled 
angiographic-recorded media are to be uploaded or sent to the Angiographic Core Lab for 
evaluation.   
6.2.3 Flow Limiting Dissections 
Major flow limiting dissections are being co llected for this study and reporting is 
restricted to grades D, E, and F per the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 
(NHLBI)1. See below.

Medication therapy and medical  treatment will be conducted at the discretion of the 
Investigator per the investigational site’s st andard of care. Subject s will be treated and 
discharged according to the site’s standard of care.  
 Documentation of Adverse Events (AEs):  Documentation of o ccurrence of AEs since 
the index procedure (see Section 8). 
6.[ADDRESS_1116727] Follow-Up 
All study subjects are to be followed according to  the investigational site’s standard of 
care practices. In addition to the standard of  care visits, study participants will either 
return to the site or be reached by [CONTACT_807989]: 
 Follow-up Contact 1:  30 ± [ADDRESS_1116728]-procedure;  
 Follow-up Contact 2:  6 months ± [ADDRESS_1116729]-procedure;  
 Follow-up Contact 3:  12 months ± [ADDRESS_1116730]-procedure. 
Subjects with a treated ATK target lesion will  return to the site to undergo a Duplex 
Ultrasound (DUS) performed at [ADDRESS_1116731]-index procedure. DUS 
imaging of the target lesion employing the “Ultrasound Guidelines” shall be uploaded or sent to the core laboratory for analysis. 
Subjects with a treated BTK target lesion will re turn to the site for a standard of care 
clinical evaluation at [ADDRESS_1116732]’s 
medical record at the site: 
 
 Documentation of Status:  Determine and document whether the subject has 
undergone a TLR or target vessel re vascularization (TVR), amputation 
procedure since last contact, and an tiplatelet/anticoagulation medications. 
Angiographic imaging of any TLR/TVR must  be sent to the angiographic core 
lab for analysis. Measurement of target limb ABI and Rutherford Classification.  
 Documentation of AEs:  Documentation of occurren ce of AEs since last follow-
up (see Section 8).   
6.[ADDRESS_1116733] Discontinuation

 However, a subject’s participation may be discontinued. Pote ntial reasons for 
discontinuation may include, but are not limited to the following: 
 Lost to Follow-Up (LTF):  A subject may be considered LTF if the site personnel are 
unable to locate the subject despi[INVESTIGATOR_807978] a third attempt by [CONTACT_667]. This does not apply to missed visits, 
where the subject misses one of the follo w up contact [CONTACT_150746], but completed a 
subsequent one (when a subject misses two consecutive follow-ups with failure of 
contact [CONTACT_103904], the subject may be consider ed LTF and withdrawn from the study).    
Before the site considers a subject LTF,  written agreement should be obtained from 
the Sponsor.   
 Withdrawn Consent:  The subject requests to terminate his/her participation in the 
study (the Investigator must attempt to  identify and document the reasons for 
termination).  
 Death:   The subject becomes deceased. If known, the cause of death must be 
documented (see Section 8.5).  
 Withdrawal by [CONTACT_10670]:  Participation may be immediately terminated by [CONTACT_269730], in the opin ion of the Investig ator, the subject would be exposed to 
inappropriate risk by [CONTACT_116680]. Additionally, the Investigator may 
terminate a subject’s particip ation with prior written appr oval from the Sponsor if the 
subject is repeated ly noncompliant with study procedures. 
 Study Termination:  The study is terminated by [CONTACT_3433] e Sponsor (see Section 11.9).  
Additional subjects will not be enrolled to replace those who withdraw from the study.

 7.2 Sample Size Considerations 
 
This study will enroll up to a maximum 350 subjects at approximately 35 sites. The sample size is based on potential adequacy of data to meet the study objectives; it is not 
based on any statisti cal consideration. 
7.[ADDRESS_1116736] deviati on, minimum, median and maximum. 
Primary endpoints will be reported by [CONTACT_807990] a 95% confidence interval. The 
calculation of rates will be ba sed on available data. Missing da ta will not be imputed.   
 
7.4 Evaluation of Primary Endpoints 
 
Primary endpoints are:  
 Achieve optimal PTA results ( ≤30% residual stenosis, without flow limiting 
dissection)  
 Achieve technical success of use wher e the UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA 
balloon is delivered to th e target lesion and inflated without movement 
7.5 Evaluation of Secondary Endpoints  
The following secondary endpoints will be report ed at the index procedure or through 12 
months at these time points: 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months. 
After UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon: 
 Rate of bail-out stenting due to dissection 
Through follow-up (30 days, 6 and 12 months): 
 Freedom from TLR 
 Freedom from major amputat ion (above the ankle) 
 Improved clinical measures from baseline (ABI, Rutherford) 
 Primary patency for ATK subjects only (as measured by [CONTACT_807987]; a PSVR 
≥2.5 suggests 50% restenosis)

8 ADVERSE EVENTS AND DEVICE DEFICIENCIES 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_807980], documen tation and reporting to the Sponsor of events 
meeting the criteria and definiti ons set forth in this Section.   Collection and reporting of 
AEs/SAEs will be limited to those events that are device and/or procedure related as outlined 
below and reporting will begin immediately following subject enrollment, during the index 
procedure. 
8.1 Definitions of Events 
8.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs) 
Collection of AEs will be limited to those th at are associated with a localized or 
systemic clinical manifestation that r easonably suggests the involvement of the 
UltraScore device and/or procedure. 
 Device-Related: This category should be re stricted to AEs directly attributable 
to the UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon device used as part of the 
procedure. 
 Procedure-Related: This category should be restri cted to AEs directly 
attributable to the portion of the pr ocedure when the UltraScore™ Focused 
Force PTA balloon is used, including inse rtion, inflation, deflation and removal 
of the balloon. AEs that arise from arterial access and adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (pre- and post-UltraScore use) should not be reported in this study.

 8.1.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Each AE will be assessed to determine whet her it is serious or non-serious. (NOTE: 
The term serious is not synonymous with se verity, which may be used to describe 
the intensity of an event experienced by [CONTACT_423]). A SAE is an AE that: 
1)  Led to a death; or 2)  Led to serious deterioration in the hea lth of the subject, that either resulted in: 
a)  A life-threatening illness or injury; b)  A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function;  
c)  In-patient or prolonged existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
d)  Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function 
3)  Led to fetal distress, fetal death or  a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-ex isting conditions or procedures required 
by [CONTACT_15365] (including subsequent re-i nterventions assessed in study endpoints), 
without serious deterioration in health, are not considered SAEs. 
To report an SAE, an event must first m eet the protocol definition of an AE as 
described in section 8.1. 
8.[ADDRESS_1116739] according to the criteria below. 
 
 Mild:  Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere w ith the subject’s 
activity or is transient and is resolved without treatment or additional sequelae. 
 Moderate:  Interferes with the subject’s usual activity and/or requires additional 
intervention and/or treatment, a nd may have additional sequelae. 
 Severe:  Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort  to the subject and/or significant 
impact on the subject’s usual activity. Additional intervention and or treatment are 
necessary. Additional sequelae occur.

 8.3 Relationship of Adverse Event to Device(s)/Procedure 
Investigators will assess each AE for its rela tionship to the device or procedure. The 
following categories should be used for a ssigning the certainty of the relatedness: 
 
 Definitely Related:  An AE is definitely related if it is obvious, certain or 
there is little doubt rega rding the relationship. 
 Possibly Related:  An AE is possibly related if it is capable of being related 
but relatively unlikely. 
 Not Related: An AE is not related if it is determined that there is no 
plausible association.  
Potential adverse events which may be associat ed with peripheral balloon dilatation with 
the UltraScore balloon are found in the IFU. 
8.4 Reporting of Events 
All AEs determined to be related to the device/procedure, should be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to notify the IRB of  applicable AEs in 
accordance with the governing IRB requirements.  
See section 11.[ADDRESS_1116741] be reported to the Sponsor within 
one (1) working day of the investigational si te becoming aware of the event. Notification 
of a subject death should be done by [CONTACT_6968], telephone call, or fax.  
Notification of death must incl ude a brief statement of the pertinent details. All available 
medical records related to the subj ect’s death must be maintained.

 Study devices in which the catheter packag e was opened, but the device was not used 
for catheterizing the subject; or  
 Study devices with which insertion attempts  were made, but the study device was not 
used in the subject. 
All mechanical failures, malfunctions, and defe cts of the study devices will be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF page and will be promptly reported to the Sponsor. The 
device(s) should be returned to the Sponsor  as outlined in the sites regulatory 
binder.  
If the device deficiency was associated with an AE, the reporting provisions for AEs 
apply. 
Any device deficiency that did not lead to an AE but could have led to one, if suitable 
action had not been taken, if intervention had no t been made or if circumstances had been 
less fortunate must be reported to the Sponsor  within one (1) working day of the event 
per Section 8.4.

Study Design
Description of Study
This study is an open -label, non -randomized study to evaluate rate and severity of 
infusion -related reactions (IRRs) of ocrelizumab infused over a shorter time period than the 
approved administration rate in patients with PPMS or RMS in the U.S.  The study will have 
2cohorts:  
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
9/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1Cohort [ADDRESS_1200063] of administering ocrelizumab per a shorter infusion protocol
for Dose 2 or Dose 3 (W eek 24 or 48 from the initial infusion).  This cohort will consist of 
patients who have already received one or two doses of ocrelizumab according to the 
approved infusion protocol (i.e., per the currently U.S. label) and have repor ted no serious 
IRRs and who will then receive the next infusion of ocrelizumab at a higher rate in order to 
deliver 600 mg over the course of approximately 2 hours.
Cohort [ADDRESS_1200064] of ocrelizumab -naïve patients 
who, after receiving Infusion 1/Dose 1 of ocrelizumab at the approved rate (300 mg over 
approximately 2.5 hours or longer) have no reported serious IRRs ,will the n receive the 
second [ADDRESS_1200065] two safety  follow -up telephone call s:  the first within [ADDRESS_1200066] meet the following cr iteria for study entry:
Signed Informed Consent Form
Eligible to receive ocrelizumab per the [LOCATION_002] Package Insert (USPI)
Able to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator’s judgment
Age 18 55 years, inclusive
Have a diagnosis of PPMS or RMS, confirmed per the revised 2017 McDonald criteria 
(Thompson et al. 2017 ) 
Expanded Disability Status Sc ale(EDSS )score of 0 to 6.5, inclusive
EDSS does not need to be performed if results within 6 months are available.
For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of 1% 
per year during the treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_1200067] dose of study 
treatment (per the USP I)
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not 
reached a postmenopausal state ( 12continuous months of amenorrhea with no 
identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization 
(removal of ovaries and/or uterus).
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% per year include bilateral 
tubal ligation, male sterilization, established hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.The 
reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.
Exclusion Criteria

13/Protocol ML40638 , Version 11. BACKGROUND
1.1 BACKGROUND ON MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating , and degenerative 
disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects approximately 400,000 people 
in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.) and 2. 3million worldwide ( National Multiple Sclerosis 
Society ).  MS primarily affects young adults, with 70% 80% of patients having an age of 
onset (i.e., initial clinical presentation to a physician) between 20 and 40 years , with 
approximately 64% 70% of diagnosed patients being women (Goodin 2014 ).  MS is 
subcategorized into three main phenotypic disease patterns including relapsing -remitting 
MS ( RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), and secondary progressive MS (SPMS).  
The term “RMS” (i.e., relapsing multiple sclerosis) applies to those patients with either 
RRMS or SPMS who continue to suffer relapses.   
1.2 BACKGROUND ON OCRELIZUMA B
Ocrelizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets 
CD20 -expressing B cells ( Klein et al. 2013 ), which are believed to play a critical role 
inMS.    
CD20 is a cell surface antigen found on pre -B cells, mature B cells, and memory B cells,
but it is not expressed on lymphoid stem cells and plasma cells (Stashenko et al. 1980 ; 
Loken et al. 1987; Tedder and Engel 1994 ).  W hile ocrelizumab selectively depletes 
CD20 -expressing B cells ( Kappos et al. 2011 ), the capacity of B -cell reconstitution and 
pre-existing humoral immunity are preserved ( Martin and Chan 2006 ;DiLillo et al. 2008 ).  
In addition, innate immunity and total T -cell numbers are not affected ( WA21493 Clinical 
Study Report ).
Ocrelizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patien ts with relapsing or primary 
progressive forms of MS ( [LOCATION_002] Package Insert [ USPI ]).See the Ocrelizumab 
Investigator's Brochure for additional details on nonclinical and clinical studies.
1.3 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT -RISK A SSESSMENT
This is an exploratory, open -label investigation to evaluate the rate and severity of 
infusion- related reactions (IRRs) of the ocrelizumab 600- mg infusion from the second 
treatment course onward, over the course of [ADDRESS_1200070] be administered at a 
600-mg dose through slow intravenous (IV)infusion. The first dose is given as two 
doses, separated by 14 days, and administered as two 300-mg infusions over the course 
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
14/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1of 2.5hours ,while subsequent doses are given as a si ngle [ADDRESS_1200071] dose .  The majority of IRRs ( 90% of 
patients reporting IRRs) were of mild to moderate intensity ,and the intensity of IRRs 
decreased with subsequent dosing.   The most frequently reported IRR symptoms during 
infusion in the ocrelizumab group were pruritus, rash, throat irritation, and flushing 
(33.0%, 29.2%, 29.8%, and 16.8% of patients with IRR, respectively) (see the 
Ocrelizumab Investigator’s Brochure) .  
A Phase II, parallel -group, dose -finding trial (WA21493 ) evaluated ocrelizumab 
compared with placebo and Avonex(interferon -β1a) in patients with RRMS for up to 
96weeks. In this study, both the [ADDRESS_1200072] cycle, during which only the 600-mg dose was divided in half and
given over a 15 -day interval, subsequent cycles involved administration as a single ,
undivided dose.  Doses were administered over approximately 240 minutes.  The 
infusion schedule in this study shows that ,both for the 600 -and 1000 -mg dose,
approximately 400 mg of ocrelizumab were infused within 2 to 2.5 hours.  However ,in 
the remaining 1.5 to 2 hours of the infusion, only 200 mg remained to be infused for the 
lower dose, while in the 1000 -mg dose, 600 mg were given within the same timefram e.  
Based on this infusion schedule, a dose/infusion rate/IRR relationship was not clearly 
observed.
The lack of dose/infusion rate/IRR relationship based on the current clinical data is 
supportive of the hypothesis that administration of ocrelizumab over a shorter infusion 
time should not pose a potential additional risk to patients in terms of increased risk of 
IRRs, but would help convenience of use and compliance for both patients and 
healthcare practices. In addition, procedures are in place to furthe r mitigate risk of IRR ,
such as a pre-treatment schedule and guidance around infusion adjustment ,if required.

 For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate 
of 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_1200079] 
dose of study treatment (per the USPI) 
 A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, 
has not reached a postmenopausal state ( 12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). 
 Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper 
intrauterine devices.The reliability of  sexual abstinence should be evaluated in 
relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.

approved for the treatment of PPMS and RMS.
4.3.1 Study Treatment Formulation, Packaging, and Handling
[IP_ADDRESS] Ocrelizumab
Ocrelizumab isa liquid formulation containing 30 -mg/mL ocrelizumab in 20 mM sodium 
acetate at pH 5.3, with 4% trehalose dihydrate and 0.02% polysorbate 20.  The drug 
product is a single -use liquid formulation in a 15- cc, type I USP, glass vial fitted with a 
20-mm, fluoro- resin, laminated stopper and an aluminum seal with a flip-off plastic cap
and contains a nominal [ADDRESS_1200082] into an 
infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride to a final drug concentration of 1 to 
2mg/mL.
Ocrelizumab may contain fine translucent and/or reflective particles associated with 
enhanced opalesc ence.  Do not use the solution if discolored or if the solution contains 
discrete foreign particulate matter.
Administer t he diluted infusion solution through a dedicated line using an infusion set 
with a 0.[ADDRESS_1200083] be administered using an infusion set with an in -line, sterile, 
non-pyrogenic, low -protein- binding filter (pore size of up to 0.2 micrometer).
The prepared infusion solution of ocrelizumab is physically and chemically stable for 
24hours at 2 8C and subsequently 8 hours at room temperature.  The prepared 
infusion solution should be used immediately.  If not used immediately, it can be stored 
up to 24 hours at 2 8C.  Infusion solution must be completely administered to the 
patient within 32 h ours of preparation (not exceeding 24 hours at 28C and 8 hours at 
room temperature). In the event an IV infusion cannot be completed the same day, the 
remaining solution should be discarded.
For information on the formulation and handling of ocrelizumab , see the Ocrelizumab
Investigator's Brochure .

concentration of approximately 1.2 mg/mL.
Although ocrelizumab may be administered on an outpatient basis, patients may be 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_860813] r.  Ocrelizumab infusions 
should always be administered in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25643] a medically qualified staff member.  
To reduce potential IRRs, all patients will receive prophylactic treatment with 100mg of 
methylprednisolone (or equivalent steroid), to be completed approximately 30 minutes 
before the start of each ocrelizumab infusion, and with an antihistaminic drug (e.g., 
diphenhydramine) approximately 30 60 minutes before each ocrelizumab infusion.
Refer to Section 5.1.1 and Section 5.1.2 for the risks associated with these mandatory 
premedications.
It is also strongly recommended that the infusion is accompanied by [CONTACT_25727]/antipyretic such as acetaminophen /paracetamol (1 g) 
3060minutes prior to the start of an infusion to reduce potential IRRs.  
Since transient hypotension may occur during ocrelizumab infusion, the investigator may 
wish to withhold anti -hypertensive medications [ADDRESS_1200088] not be administered as an IV push or bolus.  Well-adjusted infusion 
pumps should be used to control the infusion rate, and ocrelizumab should be infused 
through a dedicated line.  It is important not to use evacuated glass c ontainers, which 
require vented administration sets, to prepare the infusion because this causes foaming 
as air bubbles pass through the solution. 
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
23/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1After completion of the infusion, the IV cannula should remain in situ for at least 1 hour 
to allow for admi nistration of drugs intravenously, if necessary, in the event of a delayed 
reaction.  If no adverse events occur during this period of time, the IV cannula may be 
removed and the patient may be discharged.
See the Ocrelizumab Investigator’s Brochure for detailed instructions on drug 
preparation, storage, and approved administration.
Because of possible need to vary infusion rates depending on tolerance of the infusion,
the total infusion time may exceed the time stated. Unless an IRRoccurs 
necessita ting discontinuation, the entire contents of the infusion bag must be 
administered to the patient.
Guidelines for treatment discontinuation are provided in Section 4.6.[ADDRESS_1200089] administration of ocreliuzmab should be noted on the 
Study Drug Administration electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) .  Adverse events 
associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of any of the study treatments 
should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation for 
patients who experience adverse events are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
4.3.3 Mandatory  Premedication:  Methy lprednisolone and 
Antihistaminic Drug
Premedicate with slow IV infusion of 100 -mg methylp rednisolone (or equivalent) 
completed approximately 30 minutes prior to each ocrelizumab infusion and with an 
antihistaminic drug (e.g., diphenhydramine) approximately 30 60minutes before each 
infusion of ocrelizumab to reduce the frequency and severity o f IRRs.
Any overdose or incorrect administration of methylprednisolone should be reported as 
adverse events on the A dverse Event eCRF page .  Adverse events associated with an 
overdose or incorrect administration of methylprednisolone or antihistamine should be 
recorded as “Overdose or Incorrect Administration of Methylprednisolone or 
Antihistamine” on the Adverse Event eCRF as the primary adverse event without the 
signs and symptoms associated with it .
4.3.4 Other Prophy lactic Treatment
The addition of an antipyretic (e.g., acetaminophen/paracetamol) may also be 
considered 3060 minutes before ocrelizumab infusion to further reduce the frequency 
and severity of IRRs .

4.4 CONCOMITA NT THERA PY
Concomitant therapy consists of any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-
counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used 
by a patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 4 weeks prior to initiation of 
study drug to the study completion/discontinuation visit .  All such medications should be 
reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Patients are permitted to use the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_226]:
Oral contraceptives
Hormone -replacement therapy
Maintenance therapy
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
25/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1Anti-hypertensive medications  
Since transient hypotension may occur during ocrelizumab infusion, the 
investigator may wish to withhold anti -hypertensive medications 12 hours prior 
to ocrelizumab infusion.
Corticosteroids
–Patients who experience a relapse may receive treatment with IV or oral 
corticosteroids , if judged to be clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator. Such 
patients should not discontinue study treatment solely based on the occurrence 
of a relapse, unless the patient or investigator feels he or she has met the 
criteria for withdrawal ( Section 4.6.2 ).
In general, investigators should manage a patient’s care with supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_40801], per local standard practice.  Patients who experience infusion -
associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, 
diphenhydramine, and/or H 2-receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, cimetidine), or 
equivalent medications per local standard practice.  Serious infusion -associated events

5. ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY
5.1 SAFETY PLA N
Ocrelizumab is not approved at the shorter infusion rate.  The safety plan for patients in 
this study is based on clinical experience with ocrelizumab in completed and ongoing 
studies.  The anticipated important safety risks for ocrelizumab are outlined below.  
Please refer to the Ocrelizumab Investigator's Bro chure for a complete summary of 
safety information.
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study .  
Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at higher risk for toxicities.  
Patients will und ergo safety monitoring during the study, including assessment of the 
nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events .  In addition, guidelines for managing 
adverse events, including criteria for dosage modification and treatment interruption or 
discontinuation, are provided below .
5.1.1 Risks A ssociated with Corticosteroids
The adverse reactions of corticosteroids may result from unwanted glucocorticoid 
actions, or from inhibition of the hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal axis.  Please refer to 
local prescribing in formation.
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
29/Protocol ML40638 , Version 15.1.2 Risks A ssociated with A ntihistamines
The adverse reactions depend on the sedating properties of the antihistamine and 
include, but are not limited to, nausea, drowsiness, headaches, dry mouth, and allergic 
reactions such as rash.  Please refer t o local prescribing information .
5.1.3 Risks A ssociated with Ocrelizumab
[IP_ADDRESS] Identified Risks and A dverse Drug Reactions
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Infusion -Related Reactions
All CD20 depleting agents administered via the intravenous route, including 
ocrelizumab, have been associated with ac ute IRRs.  Symptoms of IRRs may occur 
during any ocrelizumab infusion, but have been more frequently reported during the first 
infusion.  Physicians should alert patients that IRRs can occur within [ADDRESS_1200097] their study physician if they develop such symptoms.
Hypotension, as a symptom of IRR, may o ccur during ocrelizumab infusions.  Therefore, 
withholding of antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours prior to 
and throughout each ocrelizumab infusion. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1200098] infections.  Non -disseminated herpes 
virus -associated infections, mostly mild to moderate, were also reported more frequently 
with ocrelizumab (approximately 5% to 6%, simplex and zoster) than w ith comparators 
(approximately 3%). 
During the controlled period of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518], the proportion of RMS patients with 
serious infections was lower in the ocrelizumab group (1.3%) than in the interferon beta -
1a group (2.9%); in PPMS, the proportion o f patients with serious infections was similar 
in both groups:  6.7% in the placebo group compared with 6.2% in the ocrelizumab 
group.
Serious, opportunistic, and fatal infections have occurred in patients with lupus and 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated w ith ocrelizumab in Phase III clinical trials.  Data from 
completed studies regarding infection risks with ocrelizumab treatment in these patient 
populations are provided in the Ocrelizumab Investigator’s Brochure. 
No opportunistic infections were reported by [CONTACT_860823][INVESTIGATOR_6518] . 
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
30/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1There were no reports of hepatitis B reactivation in MS patients treated with ocrelizumab, 
but it had been reported in one RA patient treated with ocrelizumab.  HBV screening 
should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with ocrelizumab as per 
local guidelines.  Patients with active hepatitis B virus should not be treated with 
ocrelizumab.  Patients with positive s erology should consult liver disease experts before 
the start of treatment and should be monitored and managed following local medical 
standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. 
Delay ocrelizumab administration in patients with an active infection unt il the infection is 
resolved.  
For PML, see Potential Risks (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Decrease in Immunoglobulins
Treatment with ocrelizumab resulted in a decrease in total immunoglobulins (Igs) over 
the controlled period of the studies , mainly driven by [CONTACT_860824], with no observed 
association with serious infections.  The proportion of patients with decrease in Igs 
below the lower limit of normal ( LLN)increased over time and with successive dosing.  
Based on additional patient exposure, in cases of conti nuous decrease over time, a 
higher risk of serious infection cannot be ruled out (see Potential Risks, Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Delay ed Return of Peripheral B Cells
Treatment with ocrelizumab leads to rapid depletion of CD19 B cells in blood by 
14days post -treatment (first timepoint of assessment) as an expected pharmacologic 
effect.  This was sustained throughout the treatment period.  The longest follow -up time 
after the last ocrelizumab infusion from Phase II Study W A21493 in 51 patients indicates 
that the m edian time to repletion (returned to baseline/LLN, whichever occurred first) of 
B cells was 72 weeks (range:  27 175 weeks). 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1200099] S. pneumoniae , mumps, rubella, varicella were generally similar 
to the proportions at baseline.
In a randomized ,open -label study, RMS patients treated with ocrelizumab were able to 
mount humoral responses, albeit decreased, to tetanus toxoid, 23 -valent pneum ococcal 
polysaccharide, keyhol e limpet hemocyanin neoantigen, and seasonal influenza 
vaccines. It is still recommended to vaccinate patients treated with ocrelizumab with 
seasonal influenza vaccines that are inactivated.
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
31/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1Physicians should review the immunization status of patients before starting treatment 
with ocrelizumab.  Patients who require vaccination should complete their immunizations
at least 6 weeks prior to initiation of ocrelizumab.  Please see the Ocrelizumab

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
PML is an important potential risk for ocrelizumab and it has only been reported with 
ocrelizumab where the risk for PML was preexisting, specifically because of prior 
natalizumab treatment.  Refer to Appendix 5for guidance for diagnosis of PML.  Please 
see the Ocrelizumab Investigator's Brochure for more details.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious Infections Related to Decrease in Immunoglobulins
(particularly  in patients previously exposed to 
immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory  drugs or with 
pre
-existing hy pogammaglobulinemia)
Based on additional patient exposure an apparent association between sustained 
decrease in immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM) and serious infections with ocrelizumab 
treatment was observed.  However, no pattern (e.g., type of infections, safety laboratory 
abnormalities beyond the decrease in Ig, latency, duration) was found that could identify 
a subset of patients at higher risk of serious infections.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1200100] not be treated.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1200101] cancer occurred in 6 of 781 females treated with 
ocrelizumab and none of 668 females treated with Rebifor placebo.  Patients should 
follow standard breast cancer screening as per local guidelines.  Please see the 
Ocrelizumab Investigator's Brochure for more details. 
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Neutropenia
In the controlled treatment period, decreased neutrophils were observed in 12% and 15% 
of MS patients treated with ocrelizumab in PPMS and RMS, respectively.  Most were 
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
32/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1mild to moderate in severity, and approximately 1% of the patients had Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia; and no temporal association with infections was identified.  
Detailed information for all risks can be found in the current Ocrelizumab Investigator’s 
Brochure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Patients Who Experience Adverse Events
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 4.  
Additional guidelines ar e provided in the subsections below.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modifications
Slowing of the infusion rate or interruption of the infusion may be necessary in the event 
of an infusion reaction.  In rare patients, ocrelizumab treatment may need to be 
discontinued. Guidance is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Management Guidelines
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 4.  
Table 4Guidelines for Management of Specific A dverse Ev ents
Event Action to Be Taken
Mild to moderate IRR If the event that a patient experiences is a mild to moderate IRR 
(e.g. headache), the infusion rate should be reduced to half the 
rate at the time of the event.
This reduced rate should be maintained for at least 30 minutes.  
If tolerated, the infusion rate may  then be increased according to 
the patient’s initial infusion schedule.
Severe IRR (or complex of 
flushing, fever, and throat 
pain)If a patient experiences a severe IRR or a complex of flushing, 
fever, and throat pain sy mptoms, the infusion should be 
interrupted immediately and the patient should receive 
symptomatic treatment.
The infusion should be restarted only after all sy mptoms have 
resolved.
The initial infusion rate at restart should be half of the infusion 
rate at the time of onset of the reaction.
Life-threatening or 
disabling IRR (e.g., 
anaphylaxis)Immediately stop ocrelizumab if there are signs of a 
life-threatening or disabling IRR during an infusion, such as 
acute hypersensitivity or acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y distress syndrome.
The patient should receive appropriate treatment.
Permanently discontinue ocrelizumab in these patients.
IRRinfusion -related reaction.
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
33/Protocol ML40638 , Version 15.[ADDRESS_1200102], regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for more information)
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated w ith symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)
This does not include any adverse event that ,had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death.
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
34/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug
Is a sig nificant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)
The terms "severe "and "serious "are notsynonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event ( e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [ NCI CTCAE ]; see 
Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as 
severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each advers e event 
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).
5.2.[ADDRESS_1200103] (Immediately  Reportable to 
the Sponsor)
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_33473] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_1200104] ructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study 
are as follows :
Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s 
Law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257] , as defined below
–Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected.
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
35/Protocol ML40638 , Version 15.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4Section 5.6.
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will ma ke 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).  
5.3.[ADDRESS_1200105].  All 
adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743], will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see
Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).
After initiation of study d rug, alladverse events will be reported until [ADDRESS_1200106] dose of study drug.
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting 
period are provided in Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consi stent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following:
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit? "
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here? "
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of A dverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v 4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 5 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes"or"no"
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also 
Table 6 ):
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discont inuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug ( asapplicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
37/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1Table 6Causal A ttribution Guidance
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, a nd the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]'s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re- challenge.
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
orconcomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
firstdose of study drug).
For patie nts receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.
5.3.[ADDRESS_1200108] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Advers e Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion -Related Reactions
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and 
are judged to be related to study drug infusion should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., 
"infusion- related reaction" or "anaphylactic reaction" ) on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If 
possible, avoid ambiguous terms such as "systemic reaction." Associated signs and 
symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF.  If a 
patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, 
each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs 
and symptoms also recor ded separately on the dedicated Infusion- Related Reaction
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
For adverse events other than infusion -related reactions (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), a
diagnosis (if known) should be re corded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
38/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and symptoms s hould be nullified and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events That A reSecondary  to Other Events
In gener al, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that i s separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on t he eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall a nd consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recor ded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on t he Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
by[CONTACT_25748] "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event 
became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.
A recurrent a dverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
39/Protocol ML40638 , Version [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormal ity qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 upper limit of normal [ULN]associated with 
chole stasis ), only the diagnosis (i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.
If a clinically significant laborator y abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above o r below the normal range 
(e.g., "elevated potassium, "as opposed to "abnormal potassium ").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L shou ld be recorded as "hyperkalemia. "
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
40/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1It is the investigator’s responsibi lity to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once o n the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as 
defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s Law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the follo wing:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
2ULN
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or a nadverse event of special intere st (see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  This 
includes death attributed to progression of MS.
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death "should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death "should 
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].   The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
41/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1If the death is attributed to progression of MS, "Multiple Sclerosis Progression "should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.   
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section 5.6.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., "more frequent headaches ").
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of Multiple Sclerosis
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should notbe recorded as adverse events.  I f there is any uncertainty 
as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an 
adverse event , per standard of care .

below.  
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_860815] f ollowing circumstances should not be 
reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event :
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria

Adverse events of special interest (defined in Section 5.2.3; see Section 5.4.2 for 
details on reporting requirements )
Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for details on reporting requirements )
Accidental overdoses or medication errors (see Section 5.4.4 for details on reporting 
requirements)
The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information).  New significant information includes the following:
New signs or symptoms or a change in the di agnosis
Significant new diagnostic test results
Change in causality based on new information
Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery
Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event
Investigators must also comply with local r equirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Ethics 
Committee ( EC).

Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of adrug in aquantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose
Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug 
–In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to ad ministration of 
the drug.
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse 
events.  All special situations associated with ocrelizumab, regardless of whether they 
result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the Adve rse Event eCRF andreported 
to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24 hours after learning of the event).   
Special situations should be recorded as described below:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name [CONTACT_26865] a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong

45/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded separately 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, 
the event should be reported to th e Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24 hours 
after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  Adverse events associated with special 
situations should be recorded as described below for each situation:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental 
overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Ent er the adverse event term.  
Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require the 
completion of two Adverse Event eCRF pages, one to report the accidental overdose
and one to report the headache.  The "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" 
boxes would need to be checked on both eCRF pages.

follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all 
serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures 
until a final outcome can be reported.
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate sou rce data 
verification.

Sponsor or a designee may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit 
to obtain additional case details and outc ome information (e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_123444], consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent 
medical assessment of the reported case.
5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE ADVERSE 
EVENT REPORTING PERI OD
The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 
[ADDRESS_1200118] dose of study drug), if the event is believed to be related to prior 
study drug t reatment.  These events should be reported through use of the Adverse 
Event eCRF.  H owever, if the EDC system is not available, t he investigator should report 
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
46/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by [CONTACT_860826] g the paper Clinical Trial Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special

communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable 
health authorities based on applicable legislation.
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference document:
Ocrelizumab Investigator's Brochure
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753].

7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data review and to confirm that critical 
protocol data (i.e. , source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_26831], complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They i nclude, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_26671], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, 
patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
Ocrelizumab —Genentech, Inc.
50/Protocol ML40638 , Version 1entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic recor d of the data) and 
considered source data.
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5.

jAll patients must receive prophylactic treatment with 100 mg methylprednisolone (or equivalent), to be completed approximately 30 minutes 
before the start of each ocrelizumab infusion , and with an antihistaminic drug (e.g., diphenhydramine) approximately 30 60minutes before 
each infusio n of ocrelizumab .  Prophylactic treatment with an analgesic/antipyretic (e.g., 1 g acetaminophen) is strongly recommended 30 60 
minutes prior to the start of ocrelizumab infusion to reduce the risk of IRRs.
kOcrelizumab will be administered as a split infusion for Dose 1:  [ADDRESS_1200135] of care for Infusion 1 and 300- mg IV over the course of 
approximately 1.5 hours (shorter infusion) for Infusion 2.

Functional Cardiac Capacity
Class Description
I No limitation:  Ordinar y physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, 
dyspnea, or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332].
II Slight limitation of phy sical activity:  Such patients are comfortable at rest.  
Ordinar y physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dyspnea, 
orangina.
III Marked limitation of physical activity:  Although patients are comfortable at 
rest, less than ordinary physical activity will lead to symptoms.
IV Inability to carr y on ph ysical activity without discomfort:  Sy mptoms of 
congestive heart fa ilure are present even at rest.  W ith any physical 
activity, increased discomfort is experienced.

Guidance for Diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy (PML)
ACTION STEPS IF PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCA L 
LE[LOCATION_006]OENCEPHA LOPA THY (PML) IS SUSPECTED: 
If the clinical presentation is suggestive of PML, further investigations should include 
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation as soon as possible.  If MRI 
evaluation reveals lesions suspi[INVESTIGATOR_25691] (see Figure 1), a lumbar puncture 
with evaluation of the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) for the detection of JC virus (JCV) 
DNA using a validated assay should be undertaken.  A diagnosis of PML can 
potentially be made by [CONTACT_699033]. 
There is no known treatment or cure for PML.  Treatment considerations are 
discussed in the medical literature (Calabrese et al. 2007).
MRI A SSESSMENT 
Although there are no pathognomonic findings that differentiate PML from MS, a 
brain MRI scan that includes fluid -attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and 
T2-weighted and T1 -weighted sequences, with and without gadolinium, should be 
performed to assess patients with neurological changes suggestive of PML (see 
Figure 1). 
Comparison with a baseline scan may assist with interpretation of the findings on 
the newly acquired MRI (see Table 2 for differences in lesion characteristics that 
may help differentiate between PML and multiple sclerosis [MS]). 
CSF A SSESSMENT 
The detection of JCV DNA in the CSF of a patient with clinical and MRI features 
suggestive of PML establishes the diagnosis of PML. 
If JCV DNA is not detected in CSF and if clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_21367], a 
repeat lumbar puncture should be perform ed. 
If diagnosis remains uncertain and suspi[INVESTIGATOR_21367], a brain biopsy 
may be considered to establish a definitive diagnosis.

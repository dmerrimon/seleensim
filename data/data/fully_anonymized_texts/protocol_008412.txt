Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/[ADDRESS_1175534] 50% of patients with advanced lung cancer experience debilitating dyspnea that is associated 
with worse medical and psychosocial outcomes. The purpose of the present investigation is to test a 
brief behavioral intervention for dyspnea, delivered by [CONTACT_845846].  Through  this study,  we seek to increase  access  to 
much needed symptom management for those diagnosed with advanced lung cancers and ideally 
improve patients’ overall quality of life.  
 
The proposed  project  is being  funded  by [CONTACT_154108]/National  Institute  of Nursing 
Research.

impairments in physical functioning and emotional wellbeing.9-11,27 
 
Dyspnea  is Associated  with  Significant  Symptom  Burden  and Psychological  Distress  
In addition to poor quality of life, dyspnea is linked to increased pain, anxiety, and mood disturbance 
among patients with cancer. In a cohort of 120 patients with early and late -stage lung cancers, 
approximately 87% reported experiencing dyspnea, and those with more severe symptoms also had 
worse pain and anxiety.[ADDRESS_1175536] number of emergency department (ED) visits in patients with lung cancer (32% of visits) 
in one study  of cancer -related  ED utilization.  Many  of these  patients  were  subsequently  admitted  to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845807].[ADDRESS_1175537]  that the median  survival  for patients  with lung cancer  who present  to the ED with dyspnea 
is only four weeks.30 In the ambulatory care setting, one study showed that over half of patients with 
lung cancer (57%) utilized many services across disciplines, such as pulmonary rehabilitation and 
physical  therapy,  given  their high symptom  burden.31 Thus,  the Quality  Oncology  Practice  Initiative  of 
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/[ADDRESS_1175538], 
the National Health Service in the [LOCATION_008] has recently developed an approach for managing 
dyspnea across multiple disease states that includes diverse caregivers: physicians, clinical nurse 
specialists, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175], occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845808].36 
Although a well -designed randomized controlled trial of the comprehensive program yielded 
significant improvements in breathlessness mastery and survival, the approach involved numerous 
clinic visits with multiple specialists.37 In the U.S., the lack of professionals trained in behavioral and 
palliative medicine severely limits the dissemination of such complex, comprehensive services.38,39  
Novel models of care that address the medical and psychosocial aspects of dyspnea in a feasible, 
acceptable, and seamless manner within outpatient settings may prove more beneficial and scalable.  
 
MGH Cancer Center Sites/DFCI Are Ideal Clinical Settings for Collaborative and Cross - 
Disciplinary Research  
At the [LOCATION_005]  General  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (MGH)  Cancer  Center,  we have  gained  considerable  experience 
in multidisciplinary  research  in the oncology  setting.  Our Cancer  Outcomes  Research  Program  consists 
of oncologists, nurses, palliative care physicians, psychiatrists, and psychologists who share their 
respective expertise to inform the development of state -of-the-art clinical interventions to improve 
comprehensive cancer care, symptom management, and quality of life for patients with cancer. In 
addition to establishing highly successful  methods for recruiting and retaining patient participants, we 
have capi[INVESTIGATOR_845809] -disciplinary collaborations to overcome barriers in communication, 
coordination, and integration of supportive care services into the outpatient oncology setting. With 
external funding from federal and nonprofit organizations, we have conducted numerous studies 
demonstrating  improved  patient  and provider  outcomes  with interventions  such as: early  palliative  care 
services;19 clinician -directed prompts for discussing end -of-life care preferences;40 the adaptation of 
cognitive -behavioral therapy to treat anxiety related to advanced cancer;[ADDRESS_1175539] 
partnered  with the Dana -Farber  Cancer  Institute  (DFCI)  and their leading  nurse  researcher  in symptom 
management  ([CONTACT_845878])  to test our proposed  dyspnea  intervention.  We will train oncology  nurses  at 
both sites to deliver behavioral techniques shown to be effective for breathing retraining and reducing 
distress.  Nurses  are well-qualified  for administering  this type of intervention  as they are integrated  in 
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/[ADDRESS_1175540] the efficacy  of a brief  behavioral  intervention  to reinforce  adaptive  copi[INVESTIGATOR_845810].  Leading  investigators  of cognitive -behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  have  posited  that a 
combination of biological factors and stressful  
life events can result in maladaptive distress 
through an interactive cycle of physiological, 
cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. The 
primary  features  of this cycle  include  increased 
autonomic arousal, negative biases in 
perception, and avoidance of threatening 
stimuli.[ADDRESS_1175541]  to having  cancer.  They  argue 
that cancer and its symptoms (e.g., dyspnea) 
represent a legitimate sense of danger to one’s 
physical and social well -being, triggering 
vulnerability in one’s beliefs about being able 
to  cope   with  this  threat.   Noting   the  bi- 
directional relationships among physiology, cognition and behavior, the theorists suggest in their 
Cognitive  Model  of Adjustment  to Cancer  that schemas  related  to the self (i.e., view  of the self) and to 
survival  (i.e., view  of the disease,  degree  of control  over cancer  and its symptoms)  play central  roles  in 
the maintenance of distress. Given the legitimate threat to survival and changes in self -schema due to 
the symptoms of advanced lung cancer, the dyspnea intervention has been tailored to incorporate 
strategies for managing the complex interplay between the medical and psychological concerns. 
Targeting each domain, the intervention includes 1) psychoeducation to enhance cognitive 
understanding of dyspnea, 2) relaxation practice to reduce physiological stress, and 3) behavioral 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_845811].  
 
Summary of Significance  
The proposed  study  is significant  in that it targets  the markedly  prevalent  and burdensome  symptom  of 
dyspnea with a brief nurse -administered behavioral intervention that has potential for cost -effective 
scalability and broad dissemination across cancer care settings. Furthermore, the intervention 
techniques are evidence -based and derived from sound theory, providing significant clinical benefit 
with minimal burden of care to patients.  
 
Preliminary  Studies  
Rate of Dyspnea is High in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer and Associated with 
Distress.28 
Our team explored the frequency of dyspnea and the risk of panic disorder and depression symptoms 
among patients with newly diagnosed non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Consecutive patients 
presenting for initial consultation at the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845812]  a survey  of current  symptoms,  including  dyspnea,  panic  disorder,  and depression  symptoms. 
Among 624 patients (mean age=63.7; SD=12.1; 52.6% female), 48.1% reported at least moderate 
dyspnea. Dyspnea was independently associated with higher risk of panic disorder symptoms (odds 
ratio=2.19, 95% CI=1.11 -4.31, P=0.02). Younger age and major depression symptoms were also 
associated  with higher  risk (P<0.01).  In conclusion,  almost  half of the patients  with newly  diagnosed

Version 1.19, 11/15/2021  
6  non-small  cell lung cancer  reported  dyspnea,  and patients  with dyspnea  were  more  than twice  as likely 
to endorse panic disorder symptoms relative to patients without dyspnea.  
 
A Tailored Cognitive -Behavioral Intervention Alleviates Anxiety in Patients with Terminal 
Cancer.48 
For this NCI-funded  randomized  trial (R03CA128478,  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_406597]),  we used mixed  methods  to examine 
the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) to reduce anxiety in 
patients with terminal cancers. Based on qualitative feedback from patients, we adapted the CBT 
intervention  by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_845813],  copi[INVESTIGATOR_845814],  and activity - 
pacing. Adults with incurable malignancies and elevated anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; 
HAM -A>14) were then randomized to individual CBT or a wait -list control group. Primary outcomes 
included:  1) the number  of completed  CBT  visits,  and 2) change  in HAM -A scores  from  baseline  to 8- 
week  follow  up per a treatment -blind  evaluator.  Forty  patients  with terminal  cancers  were  randomized 
(CBT n=20, Wait -list Control n=20), and 80% of CBT patients completed at least 5 of the 6 sessions. 
Of the total 109 completed  CBT  sessions,  45 (41.3%)  occurred  either  on the same  day as other  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845815] (n=25, 22.9%) or during chemotherapy infusions (n=20, 18.3%). Linear regression 
analyses,  adjusted  for baseline  scores,  showed  that those  assigned  to CBT  had greater  improvements  in 
HAM -A scores  compared  to the control  group  (Adjusted  Mean  Difference= -5.42;  95% CI=-10.84,  - 
.001; p=.05), with a large effect size for the intervention (Cohen’s d=.80). Providing CBT tailored to 
the concerns of patients with terminal cancer was not only feasible but also led to significant 
improvements in anxiety.  
 
Nursing Interventions Are Feasible for Symptom Management in Patients Receiving 
Chemotherapy.[ADDRESS_1175542] and 
colon  cancer.  We enrolled  and randomized  120 of 137 eligible  patients  (88%).  Those  in the intervention 
group (n=60) received twice weekly phone calls from an oncology nurse after the patients’ first two 
chemotherapy infusions. Only two patients withdrew from the study and did not complete post -study 
assessments. Although the study showed no differences between groups in the primary outcomes, it 
nonetheless demonstrates the feasibility of enrollment, retention, and collection of patient -reported 
measures within the context of nursing intervention trials.  
 
A Brief Nurse -Administered Intervention Reduces Dyspnea in Patients with Advanced Lung 
Cancer.23 
We examined  the feasibility,  acceptability,  and utility 
of delivering a brief behavioral intervention for 
dyspnea in patients with lung cancer at the point of 
care.  For this single -group  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], eligible  patients 
included those with advanced lung cancer (stage III 
or IV non -small cell [NSCLC] or extensive stage 
small cell [SCLC]) from the ambulatory care clinic 
who reported at least moderate breathlessness. The 
manualized  intervention  consisted  of two sessions  in 
which nurse practitioners taught participants 
breathing and relaxation techniques within the 
infusion clinic and encouraged home practice. 
Participants completed measures of dyspnea 
(Modified  Medical  Research  Council  Dyspnea  Scale 
[MMRCDS]), QOL (Functional Assessment of  Illustrative  Patient  Quotations  
• “It was convenient because it was during 
the appointments, and it wasn’t too long. I 
thought  it was an excellent  use of time,  and 
it was integrated very nicely with what was 
going on.”  
• “The [breathing  exercises]  helped  me when 
if I started to lose my breath, to really slow 
myself down, instead of taking shallow 
breath to my lungs, I learned to hold all the 
air in and then let it back out and fill my 
lungs faster than taking short little breaths, 
and I found that was the most helpful part 
of the program.”  
• “The nurse was engaging and very good at 
responding  to and expanding  on any kind of 
question I had.”

(Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] [HADS]) at baseline  and six weeks  post enrollment.  Of the 
32 patients  enrolled  in the study  (56.3%  Female;  Mean Age=63.34, SD=7.96 years), 84.4% (N=27) 
completed all study procedures. Comparing the baseline to  post-assessments,  we found  significant  
improvements  in MMRCDS  (p<.001),  FACT -L TOI (p=.01), and  HADS -Depression  Subscale  
(p<.001)  scores,  with corresponding  moderate  to large  effect  sizes.  In this sample of patients with 
advanced lung cancer, we observed a high completion rate for the two - session intervention. Patients 
also reported improvements in dyspnea, QOL, and distress. Based on participant exit interviews (see 
illustrative quotes), 95.5% of patients rated the intervention favorably for  its convenient location  of 
delivery,  low burden,  effective  copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110],  and positive  social support.  
 
Measuring Performance Status with Actigraphs Correlates with Dyspnea in Patients with 
NSCLC.[ADDRESS_1175543] actigraphs 
for three days prior to completing questionnaires assessing symptoms, including dyspnea, and their 
activity level. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) has a clinically 
meaningful  difference  in scores  based  on whether  a patient  is inactive  for at least half the time they are 
awake. Actigraphy objectively captures the percentage of time a person is immobile but awake. 
Actigraph reports of participants’ percent time spent immobile but awake ranged from 4 -50% 
(Mean=18%, SD=11%). Percent of time awake and spent immobile was correlated with physician 
report of ECOG PS (r=0.44, p=.004). Patient -reported dyspnea on the FACT -L was associated with 
three assessments of physical functioning: physician report of ECOG PS (r= -0.52, p<.001); patient - 
reported walking speed (r= -0.51, p=.001); and percent of time awake and spent immobile (r= -0.36, 
p=.02). Based on our findings, we will use actigraphy as an objective measure of physical activity in 
the current study.  
 
Summary of Preliminary Studies: For the past decade, our team has successfully collaborated on 
numerous  supportive  care studies  for patients  with lung and other  cancers.  The above  studies  highlight 
our accomplishments in demonstrating the need to treat dyspnea; developi[INVESTIGATOR_845816]; implementing nurse -administered symptom management trials; and using 
novel technologies for assessment.  
 
Innovation  of Proposed  Study  
The proposed  study is  innovative with  respect to  the 1)  novel model  of delivering  the intervention 
at the point  of care within  outpatient  oncology  setting,  and 2) multimethod  assessment  of patient 
outcomes . Given that patients with advanced lung cancers can be quite ill, the burden of additional 
appointments for behavioral treatment of symptoms represents a significant barrier to accessing 
services. Thus, we propose to address this concern by [CONTACT_17801] a point -of-care intervention that 
involves cross -disciplinary training and delivery within the flow of oncology care. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_845817] h a program. Drs. Greer, Temel, and Cooley possess expertise in 
behavioral medicine/cognitive -behavioral therapy, thoracic oncology/palliative care, and nursing 
practice/cancer symptom management, respectively. This team will train and supervise the oncology 
nurses in delivering the evidence -based dyspnea management intervention. We elected to develop a 
minimally intensive behavioral intervention that can be easily implemented, involves home -based 
practice,  and avoids  barriers  to scheduling  multiple  outpati ent visits,  especially  for those  suffering  from 
considerable symptom burden. Specifically, we are proposing a streamlined dyspnea management 
intervention, to be completed over two [ADDRESS_1175544] shown 
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/[ADDRESS_1175545] pi[INVESTIGATOR_845818] (see Preliminary Studies), observing strong 
correlations  between  self-reported  dyspnea  and objective  activity  levels  in patients  with metastatic  lung 
cancer.  To our knowledge,  no prior  studies  have  incorporated  this multimethod  approach  to evaluating 
dyspnea intervention outcomes, which could serve as a new, state -of-the-art methodology for 
measuring performance status in patients with cancer.  
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary  Aim 
To demonstrate the efficacy of the brief behavioral intervention for improving self -reported dyspnea 
(primary outcome) in patients with advanced lung cancer  
Hypothesis: Participants with advanced lung cancer who are randomly assigned to receive the  brief 
behavioral intervention will report statistically and clinically significant improvements in dyspnea 
compared to those assigned to usual care.  
 
2.2 Secondary Aim 
To demonstrate the efficacy of the brief behavioral intervention for improving patient quality of life, 
mood symptoms, and activity level (secondary outcomes) in patients with advanced lung cancer 
Hypothesis: Participants with advanced lung cancer who are randomly assigned to receive the brief 
behavioral intervention will experience statistically and clinically significant improvements in quality 
of life, mood symptoms, and activity level compared to those assigned to usual care.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1175546] of the brief behavioral intervention on patient - 
reported outcomes  
Hypothesis:  Intervention  effects  on patient -reported  dyspnea  will be mediated  by [CONTACT_845847]  (e.g., 
gender, age, performance status, and disease comorbidity).

4.[ADDRESS_1175549] knowledge of 
patients’  dyspnea.  However,  oncology  clinicians  often  fail to recognize  or underestimate  dyspnea.50 
Thus, relying on clinician awareness of patients’ symptoms is unlikely to identify all eligible 
patients for study participation. Therefore, in the current proposal, we will identify patients for 
study participation based upon their self -report of dyspnea using a validated standard screening 
measure (i.e., MMRCDS). We will institute the same patient screening procedures in the 
participating thoracic oncology clinics at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Dana -Farber Cancer 
Institute, Mass General Cancer Center at Newton -Wellesley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and Mass General/North 
Shore Cancer Center -Danvers as we share the same scheduling and health record systems. As a 
point -of-care intervention, we will screen all patients with lung cancer receiving care in the 
outpatient clinics and approach them in person or via telephone. By [CONTACT_845848],  we will identify  all patients 
with advanced lung cancer who are scheduled for visits in the subsequent week.  
 
A partial  HIPAA  Authorization  will be obtained  for the collection  of protected  health  information 
(PHI) prior to consent. The waiver will allow the study staff to identify potential eligible patients 
to recruit and contact. It will also prevent ineligible patients from being contact[CONTACT_845849] -person or telephone screen for a study for which he or she would be ineligible. 
Additionally,  the waiver  would  allow  patients  to be screened  with the MMRCDS  prior  to consent, 
reducing  any emotional  distress  associated  with consenting  to a study  for which  they are potentially 
ineligible. Having access to PHI will both optimize patient recruitment opportunities, while 
decreasing burden on ineligible patients. The use and disclosure of this information does not 
involve more than a minimal risk to privacy.  
 
The study  staff will review  and collect  information  on the cancer  diagnosis,  stage,  date of outpatient 
oncology  clinic  appointments,  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  Performance  Status, 
age, language, phone number and patients’ self -reported MMRCDS score before administering 
consent. Information collected from screened patients will be stored in a password -protected 
computer file that is stored on a secure, HIPAA -compliant Partners network drive.  Only

Version 1.19, 11/15/2021  
10  information relevant for contact[CONTACT_845850]. 
This secure procedure will prevent any improper use and disclosure of PHI.  
 
For patients who screen eligible on the MMRCDS (shortness of breath ≥ 2 on MMRCDS), their 
data will be scanned  and securely  stored  in a secure,  HIPAA -compliant  Partners  network  drive.  For 
patients  who do not screen  eligible  on the MMRCDS,  their data on this measure  will be destroyed 
immediately. For more information on the protection of patient data, see section 5.5.3.  
 
Before  approaching  the patients  meeting  the above  criteria,  the study  staff will inform  the oncology 
health  care team  (i.e., oncologist,  advanced  practice  nurse,  palliative  care specialist  as appropriate) 
of their patient’s potential eligibility for study participation via email or in person. The study staff 
will also notify the cancer care team of their plan to approach the patient regarding study 
participation at the next scheduled visit or via telephone should the team not respond with any 
reservations. Clinicians who express that they do not wish to receive these emails will be 
approached  in clinic  for permission  to discuss  study  participation  with patients.  All other  clinicians 
will be sent an email  containing  the patient’s  name  [CONTACT_845876].  A member  of the cancer  care team  will be informed  at least two 
business  days prior  to approaching  the patient  for the first time.  If a clinician  prefers  that we do not 
approach her or his patient for study participation, we will collect the reason for this request. 
Finally, we will state in the email or in person that study participation does not preclude the 
clinicians from medically treating the dyspnea per their clinical judgment.  
 
Once  the oncology  health  care team  has been  informed  and has not refused  study  staff to approach 
their patient, a study staff member will approach the patient in the infusion unit outpatient clinic, 
or via telephone to inquire about their experience with dyspnea. If the patient reports having 
dyspnea, the trained study staff member will explain the study. If the patient indicates interest in 
the study, they will be asked to complete a brief single -item screen to determine if they meet 
eligibility criteria (i.e., shortness of breath ≥ 2 on MMRCDS) for participation. To decrease 
participant  burden,  this brief  screening  measure  will be given  prior  to consent.  For patients  who are 
approached  via telephone,  the MMRCDS  will be administered  verbally,  via mail,  or electronically. 
If the patient screens ineligible, the patient will not be consented and their MMRCDS will be 
appropriately discarded by [CONTACT_845851] -compliant procedures immediately. 
Patients who report shortness of breath score of ≥[ADDRESS_1175550] care.  
 
Otherwise, given that patients with advanced lung cancer develop new symptoms over time,

to explain  the study  and offer  a brief  screen  to confirm  whether  the patient  is eligible  to participate. 
If an oncology clinician reports that the patient is being treated with curative intent or otherwise 
does not meet eligibility criteria, study staff will document the reason. If eligible, the informed 
consent process may be completed through either modality as detailed in this section. Both the

the reason why they prefer to not participate in the study. All willing participants that provide 
consent will then be registered by [CONTACT_464] (see below).  
 
4.2.1 In-Person  Informed  Consent  Process  
Participants will be asked to complete the MMRCDS scale evaluating shortness of breath 
to confirm  that their breathlessness  is sufficient  to participate  (as discussed  in section  4.1). 
All patients  who screen  positive  on the MMRCDS  shortness  of breath  measure  (i.e., a score 
of ≥ 2 on the MMRCDS) will be considered eligible for the study.  
 
After confirming eligibility based on the MMRCDS, the study staff will then perform 
consent procedures by [CONTACT_845852] a detailed, HIPAA -compliant consent 
form to be signed by [CONTACT_845853].

script provided within the HIPAA -compliant verbal consent form. All patients who 
provide  verbal  consent  will receive  an unsigned  copy  of the written  informed  consent.  If 
the patient does not answer the phone, the clinician or study staff member may leave a

Using  data from  our electronic  billing  systems,  we estimate  that approximately  480 patients 
with advanced lung cancer receive treatment at the MGH Cancer Center and DFCI per 
year. Although studies show that approximately 50% of patients with metastatic cancer 
endorse some degree of shortness of breath, we conservatively anticipate 30% -40% of 
patients  will report  shortness  of breath  ≥2 using  the MMRCDS  (resulting  in approximately 
140-190 eligible patients per year). Based on the high accrual rates observed in our 
previous  supportive  care studies,  and low patient  burden  for the proposed  trial, we estimate 
60% accrual to this study. Thus, we will be able to achieve successfully our recruitment 
goal of 220 patients during the 4 -year enrollment period.  
 
4.3 Randomization  and Registration  
MGH Biostatistical Core will be responsible for generating one randomization scheme. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_105975] (NSCLC versus SCLC versus mesothelioma) and 
study site ([LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845819] -Farber Cancer Institute).  
 
The registration  and randomization  procedures  are as follows:  
• Obtain  written  informed  consent  or verbal  consent  from  the participant  prior  to the performance 
of any protocol specific procedures or assessments.  
• Complete the protocol -specific eligibility checklist using the eligibility assessment documented 
in the participant’s medical record and/or research chart. To be eligible for registration to the 
protocol, the participant must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria as described in the 
protocol and reflected on the eligibility checklist.  
• The DFCI  study  staff will confirm  eligibility  criteria  and fax or email  the following  documents 
to the study staff at MGH: deidentified signed consent form/s and a completed eligibility 
checklist.  
• A member of the MGH study staff (independent from study staff who recruit, enroll and 
administer  assessments  to participants)  will perform  randomization  procedures  using  a 
randomization  schema  stratified by  [CONTACT_845854]. 
• The MGH study staff will fax or email the information about randomization to the study staff 
at DFCI. The MGH study staff may also call the study staff at DFCI to verbally confirm 
registration and randomization.  
• Both MGH and DFCI will register eligible participants from all sites in the Clinical Trials 
Management  System  (CTMS)  Oncore,  as required  by [CONTACT_102927]/HCC  Standard  Operating  Procedure 
for Human  Subject  Research  Titled  Subject  Protocol  Registration  (SOP  #: REGIST -101).  This 
must occur prior to the initiation of protocol -specific procedures or assessments.  
 
 
5.0 STUDY  DESIGN  & METHODS  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1175555]  a randomized  controlled  trial (RCT)  of a brief  two-session  behavioral  intervention 
for dyspnea management in patients with advanced lung cancer.  
 
5.2 Selection  of Instruments.  
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/2021  
13  We selected instruments based on our theoretical framework of the intervention, which seeks to 
reduce dyspnea sensations (physiological), improve understanding and perceptions of mastery in 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_845820]  (cognitive),  as well as enhance  activity/performance  status  (behavioral).  
 
Outcome  Measures:  
Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (MMRCDS): The MMRCDS is a one -item 
scale with a 5 -point grading system to evaluate patients’ degree of dyspnea.59,60 
 
Cancer Dyspnea Scale (CDS): The CDS is a twelve -item scale that assesses the multidimensional 
nature of dyspnea in cancer patients. 72 
 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Lung (FACT -L): The FACT -L quality of life tools 
assess physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well -being (27 items) and lung cancer 
specific symptoms (8 items) over the past 7 days.61 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS): The HADS assesses symptoms of anxiety (7 
items) and depression (7 items) over the previous week.[ADDRESS_1175556]  Leisure  Time  Physical  Activity  Questionnaire  (GSLTPAQ):  The GSLTPAQ  is a 
brief  assessment  of the frequency  and the extent  of typi[INVESTIGATOR_845821] (4 items).[ADDRESS_1175557]  
Chronic Respi[INVESTIGATOR_578419] (CRQ): The CRQ is a validated 20 -item measure that 
assesses  physical  and psychological  aspects  of chronic  respi[INVESTIGATOR_845822]  “mastery,”  or 
perceptions of control over the disease, and its effects on quality of life and functioning.64,65 
 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS): Study participants will be 
asked to choose the functional rating which best describes their performance status in the past 
week.66 
 
Demographic Questionnaire: Participants will self -report their age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital 
status,  religion,  education  level,  and tobacco  use (both  prior  and current  use) at baseline.   On 
8/20/2017, we amended this questionnaire to include two questions about tobacco use.  For all 
patients  who completed  baseline  prior  to this date,  we will administer  the two tobacco  use questions 
at the next assessment point (week 8, week 16, or week 24).  
 
Objective  Performance  Status  Measure  
Wrist Actigraphs: An actigraph is a portable, wristwatch -sized accelerometer device that detects 
and logs wrist movement over time in the form of activity counts. We will use Spectrum Plus 
(Philips  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_845823]),  which  is a watch -sized  device  that can be worn  
comfortably during activities of daily living, including sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], bathing, and 
exercise.  Spectrum  Plus detects  and logs wrist  movement  to measure  physical 
activity  and has a light sensor  to determine  day and night  time hours.  Spectrum 
Plus has a rechargeable battery and is fully waterproof. Data from Spectrum 
Plus are retrieved using specialized software. Study participants will also 
receive a 3 -day activity log to complete while wearing the actigraph to 
supplement the recording of their activity level and confirm their sleep/wake 
schedule. Patients will record  the times they  woke up, got  out of bed,  napped,  
went  to bed, and turned  out the lights  each day while  wearing  the actigraph.  All study  participants 

Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/[ADDRESS_1175558] participants via telephone to remind them when to begin 
using the actigraph and activity log. In our previous study assessing the feasibility of using the 
actigraph in patients with metastatic lung cancer, all study participants wore the actigraph for the 
full 3 -day period and completed the activity log.47 
 
5.3 Description  of Intervention  
 
5.3.1 Clinician  Training  and Supervision  
In our prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we created a clinician manual that includes step -by-step 
instructions  for teaching  the behavioral  strategies  for managing  dyspnea.  This manual  was 
developed and partially adapted from an evidence -based cognitive -behavioral treatment 
for anxiety  in patients  with advanced  cancer.48,51  Given  that a primary  aim of the proposed 
study  is to improve  access  to care for patients,  we will train oncology  nurses  (at each study 
site) in the administration of the brief intervention for delivery in the outpatient and 
infusion clinics or virtually via telephone or secure video visit. We will use HIPAA - 
compliant,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -approved  Zoom  videoconferencing.  The study  nurses  will first review 
the manual and then participate in a comprehensive didactic training session with the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_19316] (i.e., Drs. Greer, Temel, and Cooley) to reinforce learning of the intervention 
components as well as to clarify the process for administering the intervention within the 
outpatient  setting  or virtually  via telephone  or secure  video  visit.  The training  sessions  will 
include practicing and role playing the delivery of the intervention with [CONTACT_42164], who is 
a licensed clinical health psychologist with expertise in developi[INVESTIGATOR_845824] - 
behavioral interventions for patients with cancer. Once the randomized trial begins, the 
study nurses will be asked to complete an intervention guide/checklist detailing the 
exercises  for use in session  and to document  administration  of the intervention  components 
with each participant. Drs. Greer, Temel, and Cooley will also hold regular, ongoing 
teleconference calls with the nurse interventionists to provide supervision, address any 
participant concerns that arise, and reinforce protocol adherence. At least 80% of the 
intervention  sessions  will be audio -recorded  to allow  for circumstances  with unexpected  
technological difficulties. We will randomly select 10% for [CONTACT_42164] (or trained study 
staff member) to review to ensure fidelity  
 
5.3.2 Delivering  the Dyspnea  Management Intervention  
Patients assigned to the brief behavioral intervention for dyspnea will participate in two 
sessions. Sessions one and two will be administered in -person, via telephone, or via 
institution approved secure videoconferencing technology.  
 
Session One: The first session of the brief behavioral intervention consists of having the 
patients learn evidence -based approaches for dyspnea management including: 1) 
psychoeducation,  2) relaxation  training  for reducing  physiological  stress,  and 3) behavioral 
techniques for managing acute breathlessness.20 For the psychoeducation component, the 
study nurses will provide participants with a brief overview of the cognitive -behavioral 
model and describe how breathlessness activates the physiologic stress res ponse. 
Specifically,  the nurse  will explore  with the patient  the types  of thoughts  that breathlessness 
triggers (e.g., “I can’t get enough air; my cancer must be getting worse”) and associated 
physiologic (e.g., chest tightness, heart racing) and behavioral responses (e.g., avoiding 
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/2021  
15  strenuous activity or physically demanding tasks) that perpetuate stress, deconditioning 
and worsening dyspnea. The nurses will discuss in detail the nature of the stress response 
to help the patients understand the physiologic changes in their body as a result of 
breathlessness and to empower them to use copi[INVESTIGATOR_845825]. Next, 
patients  will learn  to manage  acute  breathlessness  with several  evidence -based  techniques 
including pursed -lips breathing,52 use of a battery -operated handheld fan (blowing air 
toward  the face),53 and postural  techniques  to minimize  work  of breathing.54,55  Commonly 
used for chronic obstructive lung disease,56 pursed -lips breathing provides natural 
resistance to lengthen the exhalation phase, strengthen respi[INVESTIGATOR_109458], and release 
“trapped” air from the lungs. Finally, as a daily practice to reduce overall physiological 
stress, participants will receive training in relaxation exercises, including diaphragmatic 
breathing and guided breathing meditation.57,[ADDRESS_1175559] patients to practice these relaxation exercises 
every day at times when not experiencing acute dyspnea. Participants will receive 
instructional pamphlets, handheld fans, and audio -recordings of the guided breathing 
exercise  for daily  practice.  Participants  will receive  study  intervention  materials  in-person, 
via mail or email.  Participants with smart phones will be able to download the recorded 
exercises to their phones, while those without this technology will receive MP3 players 
with recordings of the exercises.  
 
Session Two: The second session of the dyspnea intervention will focus on patients’ 
adherence to the study protocol, review of home -based practice of techniques for acute 
dyspnea and breathing exercises, identification and problem -solving of any obstacles to 
practicing the intervention techniques, and reinforcement of information and behavioral 
skills covered in session one. Sessions one and two will take place approximately [ADDRESS_1175560] use of 
these modalities. We do not anticipate the study groups to differ significantly in their use 
of medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], though these factors will serve as control variables in the final 
analyses as necessary.  
 
After completion of the final study follow -up, patients randomized to receive usual care 
will be offered the study intervention materials to be delivered either in person,  via mail 
or email.  They  will also be offered  the opportunity  to meet  with a study  clinician  in person, 
by [CONTACT_648], or via secure video  to review the materials and ask questions. At the time of

Clinical information regarding tumor type (NSCLC, SCLC, mesothelioma), date of 
diagnosis  of advanced  disease,  previous  cancer  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  current  treatment  regimen,  and 
performance status will be collected at baseline. The post study review of the electronic 
health record (EHR) will include information on disease progression, any changes in 
cancer treatment, and number of emergency department (ED) visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845826].  
 
Medical comorbidity will be assessed at the time of baseline data collection with the 
Charlson  Comorbidity  Index  (CCI).67 We will review  health  records  for the presence  of 
(1) pulmonary,  cardiac,  hepatic,  and renal  disease,  (2) current  and other  malignancies, 
and (3) other morbidities (diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and rheumatologic 
conditions) and assign the appropriate CCI score.  
 
Medical  orders:  We will collect  data on medications  to alleviate  dyspnea  (e.g.,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_238652]), supplemental oxygen, and procedures for managing pleural effusions or 
bronchial obstruction.  
 
[CONTACT_254716]  (Co-I), a thoracic  oncologist,  will oversee  the collection  of clinical  information 
from the EHR as well as the review of medical scans to determine whether participants’ 
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/[ADDRESS_1175563] access to them.  
 
Study staff will scan completed source documents, which may include identifiers such as 
participant names, upon their completion. Location, time, and date of the scanning of the 
document will be recorded. After the source document is scanned and the corresponding 
electronic document is confirmed to be legible, it will be collected and destroyed 
immediately. Study staff will destroy the original copy of the source document by 
[CONTACT_406663] 
(PHI).  
 
If a patient  requests  to view  his or her data collected  by [CONTACT_845855]  (activity,  mobility 
and sleep  statistics),  study  staff can provide  patients  with this data.  Identifiers  such as name 
[CONTACT_845877]. Data abstracted from the 
electronic health record in Section 5.4.2 will be maintained in REDCap. REDCap 
(Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free, secure, HIPAA -compliant web -based 
application hosted by [CONTACT_242582], Enterprise Research 
Infrastructure & Services (ERIS) group. Vanderbilt University, with collaboration from a 
consortium of academic and non -profit institutional partners, has developed this software 
toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research 
and clinical study data. Data collection projects rely on a study -specific data dictionary 
defined by [CONTACT_845856] | 
The Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center EDC Support Staff. The iterative 
development and testing process results in a well -planned data collection strategy for 
individual  studies.  REDCap  provides  flexible  features  that can be used for a variety  of 
research  projects  and provides  an intuitive  interface  to enter  data with real time validation 
(automated data type and range checks). The system offers easy data manipulation with 
audit trails, reports for monitoring and querying participant records, and an automated 
export mechanism to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus).

5.5.1 Instrument Administration  
A study staff member blind to group assignment will administer study assessments at 
baseline and multiple follow -up time points (at weeks 8, 16, and 24) with a +/ - 2 week 
window to accommodate patient schedules. The assessment battery takes approximately 
30 minutes to complete. The baseline and follow up assessments (at 8, 16, and 24 weeks) 
will occur either in clinic, by [CONTACT_2319], telephone or online via REDCap. We selected the six - 
month time frame for follow -up assessment to evaluate the long -term impact of the 
intervention  on patient  outcomes  while  recognizing  the limited  life expectancy  of patients 
with advanced  lung cancer.  The self-report  measures  have  strong  psychometric  properties 
and been well validated in previous studies.  
 
If a participant expresses that he or she is not willing or able to complete the self -report 
packet in full, the study staff will offer an abbreviated version containing the primary 
outcome assessments (MMRCDS, CDS, HADS, and FACT -L). This short form will only 
be offered if a patient initially refuses to complete the entire questionnaire packet.  Each 
participant  will receive  the actigraph  at enrollment  and will be instructed  to wear  the 
watch  for the [ADDRESS_1175565] actigraph either in person in clinic or by [CONTACT_2319]. 
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/[ADDRESS_1175566] the actigraph in the envelope, seal it, and send the envelope 
back to us  in the mail (USPS). If we cannot reach the patient’s  contact  [INVESTIGATOR_5774], we will 
send the prepaid  envelope  along  with a note offering  our condolences  and instructions  on 
how to return the actigraph.  
 
We will call the patient’s contact [CONTACT_845860], allowing for at least three 
business  days between each phone call  if we cannot reach the contact [CONTACT_9702]. At the time 
of enrollment, we inform the patient that the contact [CONTACT_845861]. The participant typi[INVESTIGATOR_845827]/her designated primary 
caregiver or spouse, who usually lives with the patient. On the rare occasion that this 
person does not live with the patient, we will work with the contact [CONTACT_845862] - 
solve how to reach out to someone who lived with the patient or has access to the 
residence in order to retrieve the actigraph and mail it back to the study staff in the 
prepaid  envelope.  If it is not possible,  then we will consider  the data to be lost. We do not 
anticipate this to be a frequent occurrence.  
 
5.5.[ADDRESS_1175567] session will occur at the patients’ next scheduled clinic visit (either in 
the infusion suite or the outpatient clinic) via telephone, or via secure video following 
baseline  data collection.  The first session  must  occur  within  six weeks  of the baseline  data 
collection. Chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced lung cancer are typi[INVESTIGATOR_845828].  Thus,  the six-week  window  will allow  all enrolled 
patients to have a scheduled appointment, with additional time should their treatment be 
delayed for any reason (e.g., holidays or low blood counts). In the unlikely event that the 
patient is unable to come to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845829] - 
week window closes, the patient will be mailed the necessary study materials and receive 
the first session over the telephone or via secure video to remain in window. In the rare 
cases  that the patient  is still unable  to complete  the first session  before  the six-week  window 
closes, the patient will be re -administered their baseline assessments either at their next 
appointment  or by [CONTACT_2319],  telephone,  or online  via REDCap.  Study  procedures  will reset  from 
the new baseline assessment.  
 
The second session will occur at the patient’s subsequent clinic visit, over the telephone, 
or via secure video, within eight weeks of the baseline data collection.  
 
Participants in both arms of the study will receive usual care for their dyspnea under the 
care of their clinicians.  
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/2021  
21  5.5.3 Special Concerns  
 
Breach of confidentiality is a concern in all studies with human subjects.  Patient 
participants  will be completing  self-report  assessments;  thus safeguards  will be put in place 
to ensure that participant information is kept private and confidential. All electronic data 
will be stored in password -protected computer files and online databases (i.e. REDCap), 
accessible  only to trained  study  staff.  Participants’  data will be identified  by [CONTACT_845863], and a link between names and ID numbers will be kept in a separate password - 
protected computer file.  Data will not be shared with individuals other than study staff.  
 
5.5.[ADDRESS_1175568].  In such circumstances, 
the PIs and investigative team will follow the following procedures:  
a. Serious Adverse Events . Given that this study is a randomized trial comparing a brief 
behavioral intervention compared to a usual care control group, we do not anticipate any 
study -related events meeting the FDA definition of a SAE (i.e., any fatal event, 
immediately life -threatening event, permanently or substantially disabling event, event 
requiring or prolonging inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any congenital anomaly). The 
proposed study population is comprised of individuals diagnosed with advanced lung 
cancer who frequently experience disease worsening, high rate of symptoms, and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845830]/or  side effects  of treatment.  Therefore,  as 
advanced lung cancer is a chronic -type terminal illness, regular fluctuations in cancer - 
related symptoms, disease worsening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency department visits, and 
deaths are to be expected throughout the study, and we will not consider or report such 
events as SAEs in this trial.  
b. Non-Serious  Adverse  Events . The IRB will be provided  with unblinded  summaries  of study 
related non -serious adverse events by [CONTACT_102952]. These 
reports  will include  types  of events,  severity,  and treatment  phase.  To date,  the majority  of 
non-serious adverse events in our prior supportive care studies have been due to patient 
discomfort with the study questionnaires.  
 
5.6.2 Anticipated  Reactions  
As this is a behavioral study, there are no ingested medications, and no biomedical 
procedures.  It is unlikely that participants will be at any risk for physical harm as a result 
of study participation.  
 
Participants may find some of the questions asked in the questionnaire to be emotionally 
upsetting,  and may experience  some  fatigue  from  the length  of the assessment  battery.  As 
this is a study targeting symptoms that are debilitating and interfere with quality of life, it 
is possible that some participants will experience depression and one of the major 
symptoms of depression, suicidality.  
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/[ADDRESS_1175569] aspects of the study.  
 
The need  for further  intervention  and referral  regarding  anxiety  and depression  symptoms 
will be determined by [CONTACT_845864][INVESTIGATOR_198442] & 
Depression  Scale  (HADS)  and by [CONTACT_845865]/or suicidality. Both the anxiety and 
depression  subscales  scores  of the HADS  range  from  0 to 21, with a score  of 11 or greater 
indicating  definitive  anxiety  or depression.  A score  of less than 7 is considered  normal,  and 
a score  of 8-10 on each subscale  suggests  probable  anxiety  and depression.  Study  patients 
whose scores increase from the normal or probably range to the more severe range for 
depression (i.e., > 11) will be called by [CONTACT_114007] (e.g., [CONTACT_42164], a licensed 
clinical psychologist, or similarly trained designee) to determine if the patient requires 
further intervention for his or her mood symptoms. Study staff will also assess for any 
suicidal ideation and ensure that the patient is not at any risk for self -harm. If the patient 
needs further outpatient services for depression, including pharmacotherapy, or is at risk 
for self -harm requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], study staff will make the necessary referrals for 
treatment. For example, for patients who are distressed but in no danger to self or others, 
study staff will refer either to the MGH Oncology Social Work Service or to the MGH 
Ambulatory Psychiatric Services (617 -724-5600), including the Cognitive -Behavioral 
Therapy Program. If suicidality or risk of harm to others is otherwise discovered at any 
study  visit,  the participant  will be referred  to appropriate  services.  Specifically,  in the case 
that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59029], study staff will contact [CONTACT_845866] (617 -726-2995), with the aid of the MGH Police & Security if 
necessary (617 -726-2121). Study staff assessments of patient distress and/or risk will be 
documented in the electronic medical record so that the clinical team is notified of any 
potential need for increased support.  
 
If participants find the dyspnea intervention uncomfortable and/or upsetting during 
intervention  sessions  or during  home  practice,  the participants  or the study  interventionists 
delivering  the intervention  may page  the PI ([CONTACT_42164])  at any time.  [CONTACT_42164]  is a licensed 
clinical  psychologist  with extensive  experience  delivering  cognitive  behavioral  treatments 
for individuals with advanced lung cancer (see previous clinical studies).  
 
The PI, co-investigator  team,  and the nurse  study  interventionists  will meet  at least monthly 
to review  study  progress,  ensure  proper  implementation  of the intervention,  and review  any 
adverse  reactions  that occur.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_845831].  
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer

assessment  (8-week)  FACT -L scores  between  study  arms,  controlling  for baseline  values. 
To evaluate anxiety and depression symptoms, we will similarly compare the continuous 
scores as well  as rates of depression and  anxiety  symptoms reported per  HADS  score at [ADDRESS_1175571] size for the brief behavioral intervention on patient -reported 
dyspnea  in our previous  trial (Cohen’s  d=1.0),  we chose  to be conservative  in estimating  the sample 
size to power the proposed RCT given the inclusion of usual care control group, proposed tests of 
mediation  and moderation,  and rate of attrition  observed  in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (i.e., 16%).  Therefore,  if 
a total of 2 00 study participants complete this two -treatment parallel -design study, the probability 
is 80% that the study will detect a treatment difference in the primary and secondary outcomes at 
a two -sided 0.05 significance level (if the true difference between treatments is 0.[ADDRESS_1175572] deviation (i.e., the lower bound of a medium effect size).  
 
6.3 Analysis  Plan 
 
6.3.1 Aim 1 
Aim 1: To demonstrate the efficacy of the brief behavioral intervention for improving 
dyspnea (primary outcome) in patients with advanced lung cancer.  
Hypothesis 1: Participants with advanced lung cancer who are randomly assigned to 
receive the brief behavioral intervention will report statistically and clinically significant 
improvements in dyspnea (per self -report MMRCDS and CDS) compared to those 
assigned to usual care.  
Analysis:  Analyses  will begin  with descriptive  and graphical  summaries  of the endpoints. 
As the MMRCDS is an ordinal measure, the statistical significance of between -group 
differences  in the primary  outcome  will be assessed  first with the Wilcoxon -Rank  Sum test 
and then with generalized estimating equations (GEE), with appropriate covariates. The 
CDS is a continuous interval measure, and we will assess between -group differences in 
these  scores  using  general  linear  models  (GLM).  All statistical  tests will be two-sided  with 
an alpha level of .05. For these primary outcomes, we will examine between -group 
differences (i.e., intervention versus control) in MMRCDS and CDS scores at the [ADDRESS_1175573] of the 
intervention  differs  by [CONTACT_845867],  use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_845832], 
we will examine these variables as interaction terms in the GEE and GLM analyses. We 
will also evaluate generalized  linear mixed  models of  the longitudinal  data, allowing  us to 
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/2021  
24  account for dependency among MMRCDS and CDS scores over time and to control for 
demographic and clinical factors, such as disease progression, (as necessary for any 
imbalances in baseline variables) when examining between -group differences in the 
MMRCDS and CDS scores across the multiple study time points (i.e., baseline, 8, 16, 24 
weeks).  Finally,  we will compute  the effect  sizes  and Reliability  Change  Index68 to assess 
practical and clinical significance of the differences in the primary and secondary 
outcomes. The GLM model will generate an effect size estimate, which can also be 
calculated  by [CONTACT_35681]  (d=Mean  change  score  CBT  group  - Mean  change  score  control  group/SD pooled). Cohen69 
utilizes cutoffs of 0.[ADDRESS_1175574].  
 
6.3.2 Aim 2 
Aim 2: To demonstrate the efficacy of the brief behavioral intervention for improving 
quality  of life, anxiety,  depression,  and activity  level  (secondary  outcomes)  in patients  with 
advanced lung cancer.  
Hypothesis 2: Participants with advanced lung cancer who are randomly assigned to 
receive the brief behavioral intervention will experience statistically and clinically 
significant  improvements  in quality  of life (FACT -L), anxiety  and depression  (HADS),  as 
well as activity level (per self -report Godin -Shephard Leisure -Time Physical Activity 
Questionnaire and the percentage of time spent immobile but awake on actigraphy) 
compared to those assigned to usual care.  
Analyses: The statistical significance of between -group differences for the continuous 
secondary outcomes will be assessed with general linear models (GLM) and linear mixed 
models, with appropriate covariates and an alpha level of .05. We will examine the 
between -group  differences  (i.e., intervention  versus  control)  at 8-week  post-assessment  for 
each specific secondary outcome (all are continuous variables), controlling for baseline 
values. In the event that the effect of the intervention differs by [CONTACT_105975], use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_845833], we will examine these variables as interaction 
terms  in the GLM  analysis.  We will explore  independent  improvements  in these  secondary 
outcomes  by [CONTACT_845868] a covariate.  Finally, 
we will also again estimate practical and clinical significance of these outcomes (using 
Cohen’s  d and Reliability  Change  Index)  and conduct  linear  mixed  models  to examine  the 
trajectory of between -group differences in these variables across all study time points.  
 
6.3.3 Aim 3 
Aim 3: To explore  mediators  and moderators  of the effect  of the brief  behavioral 
intervention on patient -reported outcomes.  
Hypothesis 3: Intervention effects on patient -reported dyspnea will be mediated by 
[CONTACT_845869]  (e.g.,  gender,  age, opi[INVESTIGATOR_20856], performance  status,  and 
disease comorbidity).  
Analyses: We will conduct bootstrapped tests of mediation to determine whether group 
differences in self -reported dyspnea (outcomes: MMRCDS and CDS) are mediated by 
[CONTACT_845870] (mediator: CRQ). Finally, we will create 
interaction terms for the GEE analyses and linear mixed models to examine whether 
differences  in reported  dyspnea  are moderated  by [CONTACT_845871]  (e.g.,  gender,  age, opi[INVESTIGATOR_173942], etc.).  
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_1175575]  sufficient  power  to examine  statistically  the intervention 
effects on service utilization, we will at a minimum calculate descriptive statistics on  
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/[ADDRESS_1175576]  Fisher’s  exact  tests and logistic  regression  to explore  differences  in rates  of ED 
visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193253], controlling for any confounders as needed.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1175577]  the 
estimated outcomes. If data appear to be missing at random, we will employ multiple imputation 
methods.  However,  if we find that patients  do not complete  the study  because  of disease  worsening, 
suggesting missing data are not random, we will employ maximum likelihood estimation from 
incomplete data, under the direction of our biostatistician, [CONTACT_845879].  
 
6.5 Potential  Problems,  Alternative  Strategies  and Benchmarks  for Success  
The potential problems and alternative strategies that we considered in developi[INVESTIGATOR_845834], length of treatment, and nature of the control 
group. Specifically, we recognize that patients with advanced lung cancer may benefit from 
meeting with clinical psychologists and/or social workers with trained expertise in behavioral 
medicine. Although increasing contact [CONTACT_845872],  we are responding  to the present  challenges  that exist  in meeting  the psychosocial  and 
symptom management needs of patients with cancer. Access to supportive care for oncology 
patients  is limited  not only by [CONTACT_845873], 
but also by [CONTACT_845874][INVESTIGATOR_3675] -supported 
techniques, such as cognitive -behavioral approaches.[ADDRESS_1175578] crossover or staggered treatment design, because of the shortened life expectancy of the 
study  population.  We also considered,  but ultimately  did not include,  an attention -matched  control 
group  given  the lack of an alternative,  evidence -based  psychosocial  comparator  as well as potential 
ethical considerations of asking patients with advanced disease to meet with a clinician for some 
sort of “sham”  treatment.  Moreover,  no data suggest  that attention  alone  would  influence  dyspnea. 
Otherwise, we will not limit access to usual care but rather examine the effects of the behavioral 
intervention above and beyond usual care.  
 
Benchmarks for success in the proposed study will not simply include a replication of our 
successful pi[INVESTIGATOR_845835].  We also aim to increase  the generalizability  and reach  of the intervention  by [CONTACT_845875]  a second  study  site. Also,  we will consider  clinically  meaningful  
Brief  Behavioral  Intervention for  Dyspnea in  Patients  with Advanced  Lung Cancer  
Version 1.19, 11/15/2021  
26  improvements in quality of life (i.e., >[ADDRESS_1175579] -L) and a Reliability Change 
Index >1.96 for the outcomes  as other  markers  for success.  If we do not achieve  these  benchmarks, 
we will utilize  qualitative  methods  to gather  feedback  from  the relevant  stakeholders  (i.e., patients, 
nurse  interventionists,  etc.) to ascertain  ways  to modify  the intervention  content  and/or  delivery  in 
order to maximize its effectiveness and adoption in multiple cancer care settings.

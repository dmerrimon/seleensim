1.0 Research Aims:  
Aim 1 : To evaluate the association between bolus rate and duration of adequate 
labor analgesia.  
 
Hypothesis:  Patients whose labor analgesia is maintained using timed 
intermittent boluses with a high -rate bolus (300 mL/h) will have a longer duration 
of adequate analgesia (time to first manual redose request) than patients whose 
timed bolus is delivered with a low er-rate bolus (100 mL/h).  
 
 
2.0 Research significance:  
 
Background:   
Neuraxial labor analgesia is usually maintained by [CONTACT_196623][INVESTIGATOR_196604] a catheter sited in the 
lumbar epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814]. Pai n from the first stage of labor is primarily due to lower 
uterine segment and cervical stretching. The pain signals enter the spi[INVESTIGATOR_196605] T10 through L1 dermatomes. Pain signals from the 
late first state and second stage of la bor also arise from the vaginal and 
perineum. These signals travel with the pudendal nerve and enter the spi[INVESTIGATOR_196606] S2 -S4. Thus, the anesthetic solution administered through the lumbar epi[INVESTIGATOR_196607] T10 nerve 
roots and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and must spread caudad to reach the caudal nerve roots in 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814].  
 
Administration of anesthetic solution into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_196608] a combination of continuous infusion, provider -administered 
boluses and patient -administered boluses (patient controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187] 
[PCEA]). The optimal method for maintaining labor analgesia is unknown. 
Several studies have demonstrated that timed -intermittent boluses, in 
combination with patie nt-controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187] (PCEA), provide superior

STU00100819  maintenance of labor analgesia (less need and longer latency for provider 
intervention, lower local anesthetic consumption, less motor block) than 
maintenance with a continuous infusion with PCEA.1-4 The mechanism for this 
difference is not known; however, one suggested mechanism is improved spread 
of the local anesthetic within the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814]. Kaynar et al. injected  methyle ne 
blue dye through a multi -orifice catheter using either a continuous infusion or 
intermittent bolus and the area of diffusion was measured on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_196609].[ADDRESS_233493] ed into the lumbar epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814], and c ryomicrotome 
sections were taken.6 Dye flowed in rivulets through small channels in the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814], as opposed to moving as a unified front. The authors found dye 
injected at high pressures had more uniform spread through the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814], 
supporting the concept of intermittent epi[INVESTIGATOR_196610].   
 
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_196611]. Several infusion rates are 
available for delivering the timed bolus, and the o ptimal bolus rate is unknown. 
We hypothesize that patients whose labor analgesia is maintained using timed 
intermittent boluses with a high -rate bolus (300 mL/h) will have a longer duration 
of adequate analgesia (time to first manual redose request) than p atients whose 
timed bolus is delivered with a lower -rate bolus (100 mL/h).  
  
 
 
.1 Significance:  The findings from this study will help us better understand 
whether there is an association between bolus rate and adequacy of labor 
analgesia. This is important f or guiding future clinical practice.  
 
3.0 Investigational Plan  
 
.1 Study design:   
 
Randomized controlled double -blinded study  
 
.2 Methods:  
 
Size of study groups(s):    
 
The primary outcome is the proportion of subjects in each group that have 
breakthrough pain requiring a manual bolus (redose) by [CONTACT_101034]. In 
previous studies that have used timed -intermittent boluses for maintenance of

E. Lange, M.D.    v 2.5  12/01/[ADDRESS_233494] required supplemental 
manual boluses of local anesthetic has r anged between 30 -50%. We hypothesize 
that patients randomized to the rate of 300 mL/h will be less likely to require a 
supplemental manual bolus than those in the 100 mL/h group.1,7 Assuming that 
50% of the patients in the 100 mL/h group will require supplemental manual 
boluses and 30% of patients in the 300 mL/hr group will required supplemental 
manual boluses, using a power of 0.8, and an alpha of 0.05 Due to the dynamic 
nature of the labor and delivery floor in patients’ clinical course and resultant 
decisions regarding their choices on pain control during labor there is a greater 
degree of unpredictability of enrolled patients being excluded from this study for 
both clinical and personal reasons. As a result 300 patients meeting inclusion 
criteria will be recruited to account for dropout and still maintain the ability to 
recruit the estimated 106 patients per study group.  
Secondary outcomes are the total number of requested and delivered PCEA 
boluses, and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_196612].  
  
 
.2.1 Participant entr y, exclusion and dropout criteria:    
 
Inclusion criteria : 
Nulliparous parturients who presents to the labor and delivery unit for an 
induction of labor or who are in spontaneous labor, and request neuraxial labor 
analgesia at    < or = to 5 cm cervical dilation are eligible to participate.   
 
Exclusion criteria:  
Patients who are not eligible to receive a combined spi[INVESTIGATOR_196613] (CSE) 
technique with [ADDRESS_233495] the epi[INVESTIGATOR_196614], or who deliver within 90 minutes of initiation of labor analgesia will 
be excluded from the study.   
 
  
.2.2 Protocol specific methods:    
Parturients who meet the inclusion criteria will be approached by [INVESTIGATOR_2394] e of the 
investigators, or one of the anesthesiology research nurses, for study 
participation. Parturients who are willing to participate in the study will provide 
written consent. Patient demographics will be collected at study enrollment.  
 
Cervical dila tion will be confirmed by a member of the obstetric team prior to 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_196615]. A baseline pain 
visual analog scale (VAS) score will be obtained using a 100 -mm unmarked line 
with the end points labeled  “no pain” and “worst pain imaginable.”

E. Lange, M.D.    v 2.5  12/01/[ADDRESS_233496] dose will be performed as routine (1.5% lidocaine with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:200, 3 mL).  
 
Labor analgesia will be  maintained using timed -intermittent boluses of local 
anesthetic with PCEA using the CADD -Solis pump (Smiths Medical). An 
unblinded anesthesia research nurse will program the epi[INVESTIGATOR_196616].  
 
The maintenance epi[INVESTIGATOR_196617] 0.625 
mg/mL with fentanyl 1.95 mcg/mL. The intermittent bolus volume will be [ADDRESS_233497] bolus will be given 30 minutes after 
intrathecal injection, as has been done i n previous studies at our institution.7 
The bolus rate will be 300 mL/h ( 2 minute 10 ml bolus infusion) in the high -rate 
bolus group, and 100 mL/h ( 6 minute 10 ml bolus infusion).  In addition to the 
programmed boluses patients will be able to administer  patient -controlled 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187] (PCEA) boluses of 5 mL every 10 minutes to a maximum of 
15 mL (three PCEA boluses in a one hour period).  
The patient, anesthesiologist, and research nurse recording clinical data will be 
blinded to group assignment.  
 
Fifteen minutes following the intrathecal dose, a VAS score and a sensory level 
of analgesia will be obtained. The following information will be obtained hourly 
until complete cervical dilation (10 cm): VAS pain score, sensory level, a modified 
Bromage sc ore (0 - no motor paralysis; 1 - inability to raise extended leg, but able 
to move knee and foot; 2 - inability to raise extended leg and to move knee, but 
able to move foot; 3 - inability to raise extended leg or to move knee and foot).  
 
The time to the f irst request for supplemental analgesia will be recorded on the 
study data sheet. The time, type and volume of local anesthetic used, and VAS 
scores before and 15 minutes after the redose will be recorded.  
 
All other clinical management will be as per rou tine, and study participation will 
not interfere with anesthetic or obstetric care. Anesthesiologists will manage 
breakthrough pain in the usual manner (assessment of stage of labor and 
extend/density of neuraxial blockade, followed by [CONTACT_196624]).  
 
Following delivery, the patient will be asked to give one final VAS score and her 
overall satisfaction with labor using a 100 mm unmarked line (the left end labeled 
“not satisfied at all” and the right end labeled  “extremely satisfied”). Mode of 
delivery, as well as the duration of the 1st and 2nd stage of labor will be recorded 
by [CONTACT_3462].

STU00100819  Patient Controlled Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13904] (PCEA) pump utilization data will be 
downloaded from epi[INVESTIGATOR_196618].  This will include the time to first 
PCEA request, the number of PCEA demands, the number of times that PCEA 
boluses were delivered, the total amount of local anesthetic consumed.  
  
 
 
4.0 Risks/Benefits:   
Risks:  
There is no risk of physical harm in this study.  The study will not result in any 
change in management of the patient’s pain other than the infusion rate of the 
timed -bolus epi[INVESTIGATOR_196619], nor in any delay in diagnosis and treatment of 
pain.  
 
 Participants are at risk for loss of confidentiality . Strict measures will be in 
place to ensure that no loss of confidentiality occurs. All participants will be 
assigned a participant study number that will be used to identify them. One 
document will link the participant name [CONTACT_196627], a nd this 
will be kept in a password -protected computer in a locked office in the 
Prentice Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Only study investigators will have access to the 
study data.   
 
 Benefits:  
  Participants will derive no specific benefit from participation in this study; 
however, participation in this study will help us better understand the optimal 
rate for delivery of bolus doses of local anesthetic during maintenance of 
labor analgesia using timed -boluses.  
 
Confidentiality:  
The subjects’ identity will be guarded by [CONTACT_20526] a numerical code which is 
only known by [CONTACT_458].  Data is stored in a department 
computer which is password protected.  Each study subject will be assigned a 
study code number. The code  will be used to link study data to patient 
identification (name) in a separate database.  Subject data will be stored on 
secured computers at Northwestern University.  Data access will be password 
protected and only available to study investigators. The d ata forms will be de -
identified after the chart review prior to analysis. 5 years after manuscript the 
data both electronic and paper will be destroyed using the current 
departmental standards.

STU00100819  .2 Data evaluation:   The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients 
requiring supplemental manual boluses of local anesthetic. Secondary 
outcomes are the total number of requested and delivered PCEA boluses, 
and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_196612]. In addition, time 
to first PCEA request, time to first supplemental manual bolus, and motor 
block at 10 cm cervical dilation will be evaluated. Categorical data 
between gr oups will be compared using a chi -squared or Fisher’s exact 
test, and continuous data will be compared using a two -tailed t -test or 
Mann Whitney U test as appropriate. Time outcomes will be compared 
between groups using a Kaplan –Meier survival analysis  technique with log 
rank test. Patients undergo a cesarean delivery or do not request 
supplemental analgesia will be censored at the time of delivery. Labor pain 
will be calculated using the area under the VAS -time curve using the 
trapezium rule.

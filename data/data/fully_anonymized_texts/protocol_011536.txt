Evaluation of Objective Pain Measurement Device   
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
May 4, 2022 
 
1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
a. Brief Summary 
The aim of the study is to develop a device that can objectively measure pain. The study 
will attempt to objectively measure labor pain with an experimental device (CereVu 
ROPA). We will apply the device to determine if it is objectively able to measure patients 
reported pain due to uterine contractions before and after labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187]. A 
brain oxygenation device, Edwards Foresight, will be used to concurrently to monitor 
brain oxygenation and hemodynamics, so the relationship between the CereVu RO PA 
device objective measure of pain and brain oxygenation/hemodynamic changes and patient -reported pain can be determined.  
b. Objectives  
The investigators hope to learn: If the pain measurement device (CereVu ROPA) is capable of reflecting different levels of pain ratings in patients in labor having uterine 
contractions and then changes in pain after receiving different neuraxial techniques  for 
labor pain. Additionally determine the relationship between the CereVu ROPA device, brain oxygenation/hemodynamic changes and patient -reported pain scores.  
c. Rationale for Research in Humans  
The pain measurement device is intended to be used in humans. The study is using dynamic psychophysical testing, which necessitates the use of specific pain-related 
questions in order to get patients' feedback.  
2. STUDY PROCEDURES  
a. Procedures  
This study contains two phases. In phase 1 (device algorithm development) and phase 2 (validating the device compared to your reported pain scores). Both phase will follow 
identical methods, only the data analysis is different.  Qualified subjects will be identified 
and contact[CONTACT_552270]. Potential patients will be informed of the study, and if they choose to 
participate, all to investigate be answered and an informed consent form will be signed 
prior to any study related activities. When they request labor analgesia, the area where th e 
sensors of the pain measurement devices (CereVu ROPA and Edwards Foresight) will be applied to will be prepped with an alcohol swab. After allowing to dry, the sensors will 
be applied to the forehead on each side of the head and connected to the devices.  Data 
recording is then started.  CereVu ROPA: Patients brain activity "objective pain" data 
May 4, 2022   Page 2 of 7 will be obtained by [CONTACT_552271] a custom -built, radio shielded device 
that stores the data for further offline analysis along with patient -reported pain measures.  
Edwards Foresight device: Will be used to concurrently to monitor brain oxygenation and 
hemodynamics, so the relationship between the CereVu ROPA device objective measure 
of pain and brain oxygenation/hemodynamic changes and patient -reported pain can be 
determined.  After collection of baseline data for device algorithm devel opment of up to 
70 patients, we will be moving to clinical validation study in which patients will receive 
our institution's standard labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_552261] (either epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], 
dural puncture epi[INVESTIGATOR_20845]) to pro vide labor analgesia. Patients 
will undergo their standard medical and obstetric treatment at the discretion of the 
obstetrical and anesthesia team. There will be no delay in their treatment due to this 
study, and the device data will not be available of i nfluence care. During the time of 
preparation of block, we will be obtaining baseline data. The research staff will be 
recording pain scores with contractions at regular intervals until approximately [ADDRESS_725829] clinical care. There will be no online 
display for "pain" on the device so potentially no change in medical treatment.  
c. Use of Deception in the Study  
No 
d. Use of Audio and Video Recordings  
No 
e. Alternative Procedures or Courses of Treatment  
The medical treatment will be the same for those patients involved in the study as for those in the general patient population. The alternative to participating in the study is not 
to participate. No standard treatments will be withheld in either case.  
f. Will it be possible to continue the more (most) appropriate therapy for the 
participant(s) after the conclusion of the study?  
NA 
g. Study Endpoint (s) 
Study end-point will be the completion of sample size. We will complete the enrollment 
and then do the data analysis.  
May 4, [ADDRESS_725830] Experimental and/or Clinical Findings  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_552262], the gold standard for measuring pain is still a 
subjective verbal numeric rating scale rating (0 -10 or 0 -100) obtained from the individual 
reporting pain. This is by [CONTACT_552272], nor is it available wheneve r such a rating is 
warranted, for example from patients who are sedated or confused or anesthetized e.g. in 
intraoperative or intensive care settings. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_552263] "pain" measured by [CONTACT_552273]. We, therefore, want to investigate the 
possible use of these objective pain devices in a clinical setting.

m. Planned Duration of the Study  
The study is anticipated to take 1-1.5 years.  
The total time per participant will likely be:

in more detail to them and written informed consent will be obtained. This screening 
process will take 10 minutes.

epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892].  
iii) Individual data analysis will take approximately 4 weeks.  
5. RISKS 
a. Potential Risks  
i. Investigational devices  
Patients will be connected to two objective pain measurement devices (CereVu ROPA and Edwards Foresight) via a sensor that will be applied to their forehead (one sensor on 
each side of their forehead).  
ii. Investigational drugs 
NA 
iii. Commercially available drugs, biologics, reagents or chemicals  
NA 
iv. Procedures 
Non-investigational procedures include:  
1) Neuraxial blocks, risks of which may include (but are not limited to) injection pain, perivascular or inadvertent arterial injection with the risk of necrosis, postoperative 
nausea, and vomiting, nerve injury, post dural headache, rarely meningitis, compression 
of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_552266] y to clot formation or abscess, paresthesia, and weakness.  
Patients will receive neuraxial analgesia as part of standard care and unrelated to this study.  
 Study -related procedures include:  
1) Answering questions. This carries no risk.  
2) Applying a sensor with adhesive on the forehead of the patient. This carries a minimal 
risk of skin irritation.

c. Procedures to Minimize Risk  
Patients will be monitored closely in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552267].  
Analgesia will be provided by [CONTACT_552275][INVESTIGATOR_130645], using all of the 
guidelines required to minimize risk. Every effort will be made to make sure subjects are 
comfortable while they complete the questionnaires.  
d. Study Conclusion 
The experiment terminates after all data has been collected from the patients.  
Patients will be free to opt out of this study at any time. Patients will be able to contact 
[CONTACT_552276]. Patients can 
also opt out of the study by [CONTACT_425758] a member of the nursing staff. We wil l liaise with 
the nursing staff to ensure that the research team is informed if patients opt out by [CONTACT_425758] a member of the nursing staff. Once this is confirmed, no further patient or 
study data will be included in this study. A study investigator will confirm in writing that 
the patient has opted out of the study with relevant documentation in the patient's chart. 
We will ensure that our study does not detract from or interfere with any aspect of 
clinical management for each enrolled patient. If this occurs, study investigators will 
terminate the participation of individual participants in this study, and all data will be 
destroyed.

6. BENEFITS  
There are no potential direct medical benefits for subjects participating in this research. Indirect benefits subjects may gain are a feeling of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_552269], contributing to increased 
scientific knowledge, increased information about one’s own health or knowledge of resources, 
improvement in psychological well -being due to interacting wi th research staff or content of 
interviews/questionnaires. Potential benefits this research has to society is the ability to quantify pain objectively in subjects undergoing labor pains. It will also help to improve our knowledge of 
pain processing in patients undergoing different types of neuraxial blocks.

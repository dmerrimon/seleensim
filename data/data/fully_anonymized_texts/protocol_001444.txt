BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION FOR CONDUCTING THE TRIAL
Sodium pi[INVESTIGATOR_594776] a low -volume cleansing agent that was developed to 
provide an efficient and well tolerated method of clearing the bowel prior to X -ray examination, 
endoscop y,or surgery . The safet y, tolerability , and efficacy  of PREPOPIK®were demonstrated in two 
well-controlled clinical trials, and PREPOPIK®was approved in 2012 in the US for cleansing of the 
colon as a preparation for colonoscop y in adults.
PREPOPI K®is currentl y formulated as a powder for reconstitution with cold water immediatel y before 
use. A readyto drink oral solution ofSodium Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31320], Magnesium Oxid e and A nhydrous Citric 
Acid (NaP/MC ) has been developed that eliminates the need for the reconstituting and mixing steps by 
[CONTACT_423] . The new oral solution has the same active ingredients in the same quantities as 
PREPOPI K®. The dosage administered to the subject remains the same as that of PREPOPIK®. Thus, 
the Sodium Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31320], Magnesium Oxide ,Anhydrous Citric Acid ( NaP/MC) Oral Solution should be 
as effective as PREPOPIK®in colon cleansi ng, with a similar safet y and tolerability profile.
The current study  will be conducted to assess the non- inferiorit y of a split -dose regimen of NaP/MC
Oral Solution to a split -dose regimen of PREPOPIK®in adult subjects undergoing elective 
colonoscop y.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALSTATISTICAL METHODS
Sample Size Calculation
The primary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate non-inferiorit y (NI)of NaP/MC Oral Solution to
PREPOPI K®for overall colon cleansing prior to colonoscopy  using the Modified Aronchick Scale 
(see Appendix C )
,as assessed b y a blinded endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541] .1A subject is considered to be a “responder” if 
overall colon cleansing is either “excellent” or “good” on the Modified Aronchick Scale .
The assumed true responder rate for PREPOPIK®is 84% based on the Modified Aronchick Scale
(FE2009 -01 and FE2009-02). It is assum ed that the true responder ratesof subjects treated with 
PREPOPI K®orNaP/MC Oral Solution are the same . A non- inferiority  ( NI) margin of 8% was chosen, 
to ensure no more than a 10% relative decrease from the control. Four hundred fift y (450) randomized 
subjects per treatment group are required
,in a 1:1 randomization ,to maintain 90% power to 
demonstrate the NI of NaP/MC Oral Solution t
oPREPOPI K®for overall colon cleansing prior to 
colonoscop yat the one-sided 0.025 significance level .
Efficacy:
The primary  objective of the trial is to demonstrate the NIof NaP/MC Oral Solution to PREPOPI K®
for colon cleansing in preparation for colonoscop y. The NImargin for the difference between 
treatments ( NaP/MC Oral Solution minus PREPOPI K®) will be -8 % (absolute). The NIhypothesis to 
be tested for the primary  endpoint will be:
H0: π NaP/MC Oral Solut ion- π PREPOPIK®≤ -8% 
against the alternative 
H1: π NaP/MC Oral Solution -
πPREPOPIK®> -8%, 
where π NaP/MC Oral Solution and π PREPOPIK®denote the true percentage of subjects classified as responders 
(i.e., “excellent ”and “good” according to the Modified Aronchick Scale [see Appendix C ] )among
subjects treated with NaP/MC Oral Solution or PREPOPI K®, respectivel y, for colon cleansing in 
preparation for colonoscopy .
The null hy pothesis (H 0) will be tested against the alternative by  [CONTACT_2164] a 2 -sided 95% 
confidence interval for the difference in responder rates. The primary  analy sis will be adjusted for the 
stratification factor (site) by [CONTACT_594814] -Haenszel method to combine results across sites. In 
brief, this corresponds to deriving a weighted average across sites where the weight depends on the 
number of observations in each treatment group in each stratum.  Subjects who do no t have an 
excellent or good rating according to the Modified Aronchick Scale (see Appendix C )for any reason

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALwill be considered treatment failures ( i.e., not a responder). If the lower limit of the 95% confidence 
interval is greater than the NImargin (-8%), the null hy pothesis will be rejected and it will be claimed 
that 
NaP/MC Oral Solution is non -inferior to PREPOPI K®with respect to colon cleansing in 
preparation for colonoscopy . The primary  efficacy  analy sis will be conducted for the modified 
intent ion-to-treat population, defined as all randomized (as planned) subjects who received at least one 
dose of treatment. If the NIcriteria aresatisfied in both the primary  efficacy  analy sis and the secondary  
efficacy  anal ysis of the right colon, then a test for superiority  will be performed for the primary  
efficacy  anal ysisby [CONTACT_594815] 0.0%. If the lower 
bound of the confidence interval is above 0.0% ,then superiorit y will be declared.  
The NIanalysis will also be conducted for the per -
protocol (PP) population as a sensitivity  analy sis.  
For the three secondary responder endpoints that are based on BBPS (c leansing of right, left and 
transverse segment), using the mITT population and the anal ysis methodology  described for the 
primary  endpoint a 95% two
-sided confidence interval for responder rate difference of NaP/MC Oral 
Solution minus PREPOPIK®will be constructed. The NI of NaP/MC Oral Solution compared with 
split-dose PREPOPI K®in cleansing of the right colon will be assessed if and only  if non- inferiorit yis 
demonstrated for the primary  endpoint .The NI assessment for this endpoint will be similar to the NI 
assessment of primary endpoint and will be using the same NI margin of - 8%.
The responses toMayo Clinic Bowel Prep Tolerability  Questionnaire questions (see Appendix D )will 
be summarized by  [CONTACT_2939] .  All safet y data will be summarized descriptively .
PK Assessment :
For PK assessment, blood sample swill be collected on a subset of sixty  (60) subjects three times on 
the dayof colonoscop y. Sixty (60) subjects (approximately 30 per arm) are considered to be sufficient 
to chara cterize the PK population for sodium pi[INVESTIGATOR_594781] .In addition to this, all subjects 
enrolled in the study , including this PK subset, will have one (1) PK blood sample drawn for sodium 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_594782] (approximately  2  hours prior to the 
colonoscop y).

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
A colonoscop y is a minimally invasive endoscopic examination of the colon that is effective as a 
cancer prevention tool, diagnostic method, and therapeutic intervention. In the [LOCATION_002] (US), 
where colonoscop y has been the standard for colorectal cancer screening, there has been a 3% annual 
decrease in colorectal cancer incidence each year for the past three decades.4Regular screening, 
beginning at age 50 for average -risk individuals (age 45 for African Americans), is recommended to 
prevent colorectal cancer.5However, screen rates remain lower than the American Cancer Societ y’s 
target rate ,with only  63% of adults age 50 years or older having a colonoscopy  in 2015.6Getting 
subjects to participate in screening programs is difficult, and the overall experience —including the 
cleansing procedure —influences subjects ’ willingness to undergo sc reening colonoscopy  or repeat 
procedures.[ADDRESS_784668] discomfort or adverse reactions, require a large volume of 
fluid, and/or have an unpleasant taste can result in low compliance rates and unsatisfactory  cleansing, 
leading to a poor -quality  examination.8,10,11An agent that can be administered as a split dose is 
preferable due to superior bowel cleaning efficacy compared with single -dose administration and a 
better subject experience , asmeasured b y greater willingness b y the subject to undergo a future 
colonoscop y.8In addition, recent evidence confirms that a split- dose regimen results in higher 
adenoma detection rates.[ADDRESS_784669]. I t has been 
available as Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31326]®in the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]) since 1980, and in Canada as Pi[CONTACT_3252] -Salax®since

Oral Solution
Clinical Trial Protocol - Amendment 1
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALPowder for Ora l Solution (PREPOPIK®) was approved in 2012 and is currently  indicated for cleaning 
of the colon as a preparation for colonoscop y in adults. 
The current, approved formulation of PREPOPIK®is a powder, supplied as a two -packet treatment (20 
mg sodium pi[INVESTIGATOR_594784]) ,which is reconstituted by  [CONTACT_594816]. 
PREPOPI K®may be administered as either a split -dose regimen, with the second dose taken on the 
day of the colonoscopy ,or as a day -before regimen , in which both doses are taken the evening before 
the colonoscop y.
In the US ,
the colon cleansing efficacy  of PREPOPI K®was established in two randomized, 
Investigator -blinded, active -controlled, multicenter trials in subjects scheduled to have an elective 
colonoscop y. In all, 1195 adult subjects were evaluated in the primary efficacy analyses. Subjects 
ranged in age from 18 to 80 y ears (mean age 56 y ears); 61% were fem ale and 39% male. 
Subjects randomized to PREPOPI K®in the two studies were treated with one of two dosing regimens:
In the first study ,13PREPOPI K®was given by  “Split- Dose” (evening before and day  of) dosing, where 
the first dose was taken the evening before the colonoscopy  (between 5:00 and 9:00 PM), followed by  
5 eight -ounce glasses of clear liquid, and the second dose was taken the morning of the colonoscopy  (at 
least five hours prior to but no more than nine hours prior to colonoscop y), followed b y 3 eight -ounce 
glasses of clear liquid.
In the second stud y,6PREPOPI K®was given b y “Day -Before” (afternoon/evening before onl y) dosing, 
where both doses were taken separatel y on the day before the colonoscop y, with the first dose taken in 
the afternoon (between 4:00 and 6:00 PM), followed by  5 eight -ounce glasses of clear l iquid, and the 
second dose taken in the late evening (approximately  six hours later, between 10:00 PM and 12:00 
AM), followed b y 3 eight -ounce glasses of clear liquid.
The comparator in each study  was a preparation containing two liters of poly ethylene gly col plus 
electrol yte solution (PEG + E) and two 5- mg bisacody l tablets, administered the day  before the 
procedure. All subjects in both the PREPOPI K®and comparator groups were limited to a clear liquid 
diet on the day  (i.e.,24 hours) before the procedure .
The primary  efficacy  endpoint was the proportion of subjects with successful colon cleansing (“good” 
or “excellent”) , as assessed by  a blinded colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_594785].1With day -
before dosing, PREPOPIK®was non -inferior to the comparator cleansing regimen.6PREPOPI K®
administered in a split- dose regimen met the pre -specified criteria for superiority  to the comparator for 
colon cleansing.6

PREPOPI K®compared with the PEG +E and bisacody l tablet regimen in both studies. A greater 
proportion of subjects rated the PREPOPI K®regimen as “very  easy” or “easy ” to consume and as 
having an “excellent” or “good” taste compared with PEG and bisacody l tablets .6,13In addition, subject 
compliance was better with PREPOPI K®: a greater proportion of subjects who received PREPOPIK®
reported having consumed the entire preparation as instructed compared with subjects who received 
PEG and biscody l tablets.6,[ADDRESS_784671] common one s following PREPOPI K®administration.
Ferring Pharmaceuticals has developed a pre -mixed oral solution of Sodium Pi[INVESTIGATOR_31320], Magnesium 
Oxide and Anhy drous Citric Acid ( NaP/MC ) that eliminates the need for reconstituting and mixing 
steps. The dosage administered to the subject remains the same as that of PREPOPI K®. Thus, NaP/MC 
Oral Solution should be as effective as and have a similar safet y and tolerability  profile toPREPOPIK®
for colon cleansing in preparation for colonoscop y.
1.2 Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial
The current study  will be conducted to directly  compare the NaP/M C Oral Solution with PREPOPIK®
using a split dose regimen for colon cleansing in adult subjects undergoing colonoscopy . 
1.3 Benefit / Risk Aspects
Compared with other existing alternatives for bowel cleansing, PREPOPI K®has a relativel y small er
volume of liquid for the subjects to drink.11PREPOPI K®is also safe, effective and tolerable.  NaP/MC 
Oral Solution has the same active ingredients, in the same quantities as PREPOPI K®when dosed by  
[CONTACT_594817] a similar efficacy , safet y, and tolerability profile.
Subjects’ vital signs, ECG, laboratory  values, and any  AEs reported will be monitored throughout the 
two-day treatment period and during a four -week follow -up period.

Overall Design and Control Methods
This study  is a randomized, assessor -blinded, NI, multi -center study  that will be conducted in 
approximately  10-15 study  centers in the US and Canada , following approval by  [CONTACT_594818]. 
Following appropriate infor med consent procedures, subjects who fulfill eligibility  criteria and require 
a colonoscop y will be randomized to one of two treatment arms:
NaP/MC Oral Solution: Supplied as two 160- mL bottles per subject .The medication needs no 
further reconstitution before administration.
PREPOPI K®: Supplied as two packets per subject . Subjects will be instructed to reconstitute
the medication by [CONTACT_594811] ( 5) ounces of 
cold water and stirring 
for two to three minutes (in some cases the cup may  feel warm ,which is 
normal). 
Only  the subject and the site -designated, unblinded coordinator and pharmacist (if applicable) will 
know the treatment group in which the subjects will be participating. The designated unblin ded 
coordinator will instruct the subject on the use of the bowel preparation, and both will sign a 
nondisclosure affidavit form (Appendix A ),attesting to their agreement that they  will not disclose the 
treatment group to an yone . Treatment will be blinded to the designated endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_594786].
For each treatment arm, s ubjects will begin treatment (first dose) on the evening before the 
colonoscop y between 5:00 PM and 9:00 PM, and will complete the treatment (second dose) the 
following day  at least 5 hours, but no more than 9 hours ,prior to the colonoscopy .
Subjects randomized t o the NaP/MC Oral Solution:
After drinking the first dose, subjects should drink five (5) or more eight- ounce glasses of clear liquid 
within five (5) hours.  After drinking the seco nd dose, subjects should drink four (4) or more eight -
ounce glasses of clea r liquid within five (5) hours. Subjects should not take any thing by  [CONTACT_594819] (2) hours before the time of the colonoscop y.

[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding
Study treatment(s) will be allocated according to computer -generated randomization codes prepared for 
all study  sites and assigned via IVRS . The randomization assignment will be available onl y to the 
person dispensing the drug 
(unblinded coordinator or pharmacist (if applicable) ), but not to any  other 
personnel involved in the conduct and evaluation of the study  until the study
 database is lock ed. 
Treatment is blinded to the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_594788] y and assessing the efficacy of the 
tested preparations and his/her assistant(s) .
Prior to the start of the study , the investigator will assign a coordinator and a pharmacist (if applicable) 
to act as the site-designated unblinded coordinator. Th ese individuals will be the only  individuals 
unblinded to the subject’ s treatment groupand will be re sponsible for the distribution and 
accountability  of the study  drug. The un blinded coordinator will instruct each subject how and when to 
proper lyadminister the 
study  drug and will explain any dietary  restrictions . Th e unblinded coordinator
will be available to answer the subject’s questions regarding the stud y drug an d its administration.
The integrity  of blinding will be further preserved by  [CONTACT_594822] ,the unblinded coordinator ,
and the unblinded pharmacist (if applicable) to sign a nondisclosure affidavit form instructing subjects ,
the unblinded coordinator and the unblinded pharmacist (if applicable) not to disclose the assigned 
treatment group to the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_594788] y and his/her assistants.
[IP_ADDRESS]
Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment
In case of an emergency , emergency  decoding envelope will be available to the investigator and the 
sponsor's medical monitor . Breaking of the blind forindividual subjects is only  permitted in the case of 
a serious, unexpected or other important AE, when the knowledge of the invest igational product in 
question is required for therapeutic decisions for the management of the subject.
If it is necessary  to unblind an individual subject’s treatment for the purposes of expedited reporting to 
the authorities and/or IRBs, only  those indivi duals within Ferring Pharmaceuticals whose responsibility  
it is to report this information will know the identity  of the IMP. Every  effort will be made to maintain 
the blinding of site and sponsor personnel throughout the course of the study. Other personn el may  be 
unblinded for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, including trial site staff as well as staff 
acting on behalf of Ferring.
As far as the emergency permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed by  [CONTACT_31374] . It should be recorded in the CRF that the blind is broken, why , when, and by  [CONTACT_20898]. 
In case of accidental unblinding (e.g., the subject tells the assessor ), the same documentation as for 
emergency  unblinding must be obtained, i.e., the code envelope must be opened and wh y, when, and

3.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Trial
NaP/MC Oral Solution is a new liquid formulation that is provided as an oral solution with the same 
active ingredients, in the same quantities as PREPOPI K®when dosed by  [CONTACT_102] .The dosage 
administered to the subject remains the same as that of PREPOPI K®.
PREPOPI K®was chosen as the active comparator because when reconstituted it has the same active 
ingredients as the IMP and has been demo nstrated to be safe and effective as a colon cleansing 
preparation.

Adverse Event
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and s ymptoms 
should be recorded. One diagnosis/s ymptom should be entered per record.

duration of the event.a
Note the following: A procedure is not an adverse event; the reason for conducting the procedure is. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594796] (it is an outcome ); the reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270588]. Death is not 
an adverse event (it is an outcome); the cause of death is (an exception is sudden death of unknown 
cause, which is, itself, an adverse event).
Date and Time of Onset
The date of onset is the date when the first sign(s) or symptom(s) were first noted. If the adverse event 
is an abnormal ,clinicall y significant laboratory test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the 
date the sample was taken or the examination was per formed. 
Intensity
The intensity  of an adverse event must be classified using the following three -point scale:
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.
Moderate: Event sufficient to affect usual activity  (disturbing).
Severe: Inability  to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable).
Causal Relationship to IMP
The possibility  of whether the IMP caused the adverse event must be classified as one of the following:
Reasonable possibility : 
There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the adverse event. 
The adverse event may  occur as part of the pharmacological action of the IMP or may  be unpredictable 
in its occurrence.
Examples: 
Adverse events that are uncommon but are known to be strongl y associated with I MP exposure
                                                
aException: if an adverse event w ith onset before the first IMP administration (i.e., a pre -treatment adverse event) 
worsens in intensity, this must be recorded as tw o separate events. The initial adverse event should be recorded 
with outcome “not recovered ,” and the date and time of outcome is when the intensity changed. The second 
adverse event should be recorded with date and time of onset when the intensity changed.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALAdverse events that are not commonly  associated with I MP exposure, but the event occurs in 
association with other factors strongl y suggesting causation, such as a strong temporal 
association, or the event recurs on rec hallenge .
No reasonable possibility:
There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the 
adverse event.
Examples:
Known consequences of the underl ying disease or condition under investigation
Adverse events common in the trial population, which are also anticipated to occur with some 
frequency  during the course of the trial, regardless of IMP exposure
Action Taken to IMP
The action taken to the IMP in response to an adverse event must be classified as one of the following:
No change (medication schedule maintained or no action taken)
Withdrawn
Interrupted
Other Action Taken
Adverse events requiring therap y must be treated with recogni zed standards of medical care to protect 
the health and well- being of the subject. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines must be 
available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency  situation.
If medication is administered to treat the adverse event, this medication should be entered in the 
Concomitant Medica tion Log.
Date and Time of Outcome
The date and time the subject recovered or died.
Outcome
The outcome of an adverse event must be classified as one of the following:

The assumed true responder rate for PREPOPIK®is 84% w hen using the Modified Aronchick Scale
(FE2009 -01 and FE2009- 02). It is assum ed that the true responder rate of subjects treated with 
PREPOPI K®orNaP/MC Oral Solution are the same . A NI margin of 8% was chosen, to ensure no 
more than a 10% relative decrease from the control.  F our hundred and fift yrandomized subjects per

For PK assessment, blood samples will be collected on a subset of sixty  (60) subjects three times on 
the day of colonoscop y. Sixty  (60) subjects (approximately  30 per arm) are considered to be sufficie nt 
to characterize the PK population for sodium pi[INVESTIGATOR_594781]. In addition to this, all subjects 
enrolled in the study , including this PK subset, will have one (1) PK blood sample drawn for sodium

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALtreated with NaP/MC Oral Solution orPREPOPIK®, respectivel y, for colon cleansing in preparation 
for colonoscop y.
The null hy pothesis (H 0) will be tested against the altern ative b y constructing a 2 -sided 95% 
confidence interval for the difference in responder rates. The primary  analysis will be adjusted for the 
stratification factor (site) by  [CONTACT_594814] -Haenszel method to combine results across sites. In 
brief, this c orresponds to deriving a weighted average across sites where the weight depends on the 
number of observations in each treatment group in each stratum.  Subjects who do not have an 
excellent or good rating according to the Modified Aronchick Scale (see Appendix C )for any reason 
will be considered treatment failures (i.e., not a responder). If the lower limit of the 95% confidence 
interval is greater t han the margin (-8%), the null hy pothesis will be rejected and it will be claimed that 
NaP/MC Oral Solution is non -inferior to PREPOPIK®with respect to colon cleansing in preparation 
for colonoscop y. If NI is demonstrated for both the primary  efficacy  endpoint and the secondary  
efficacy  endpoint for the right colon
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) , and if the lower bound of the confidence 
interval is above 0%then, superiority  will be declared. 
The NIanalysis will also be conducted for the per -
protocol (PP) population as a sensitivity  analy sis.  
An additional sensitivity  anal ysis may  be performed, where a multiple imputation method will be 
applied to imput e for subjects with missing colonoscopy assessment for reasons other than drug 
tolerability  and for patients where water insufflation was used. Details of such anal ysis will be 
described in the anal ysis plan.
9.6.3 Secondary Endpoint(s)
[IP_ADDRESS] BBPS (Right Colon)
The difference between the responder rates in the right colon cleansing using NaP/MC Oral Solution or
PREPOPI K®will be assessed. A subject is considered to be a “responder” if the BBPS (Right Colon)
score is ≥2 .Using the mITT population and the analy sis meth odology  described for the primary  
endpoint a 95% two
-sided confidence interval for the responder rate difference of NaP/MC Oral 
Solution minus PREPOPIK®will be constructed. If the NI objective is met for the primary  endpoint, 
this CI s will be used to assess the NIof NaP/MC Oral Solution toPREPOPI K®in the cleansing of 
right colon 
as assesse d by [CONTACT_594834]. The NImargin for the testing the difference between treatments 
(NaP/MC Oral Solution minus PREPOPI K®) for cleansing of the right colon is again set to be -8%

Solution will be declared non -inferior to 
PREPOPIK®with respect to the cleansing of the right colon.

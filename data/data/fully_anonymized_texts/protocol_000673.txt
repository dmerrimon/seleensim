Healthcare Claims Data

Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
1.RCT Details
This section provides a high-level overview of a published RCT that the described real-world evidence study is trying to replicateas closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.
1.1 Title 
Oral Rivaroxaban for the Treatment of Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism  (EINSTEIN PE) 
1.2 Intended aim(s) 
To compare the risk of symptomatic, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with acute, symptomatic 
pulmonary embolism (PE) with or without deep vein thrombosis for rivaroxaban versus standard therapy of warfarin. 
1.3 Primary endpoint for replication  
The primary outcome of the study was symptomatic, recurrent VTE 
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable) 
Assuming a noninferiority margin of 2.0, it was determined that about 3,000 patients would be needed to achieve 90% 
power  to conclude noninferiority of rivaroxaban over standard therapy at two-sided alpha of 0.05.  
1.5 Secondary endpoint for replication (assay sensitivity) and RCT finding 
Major bleeding; RR = 0.90 (95% CI 0.76–1.07) 
1.6 Trial estimate 
RR = 1.12 (95% CI 0.75-1.58) comparing rivaroxaban vs standard therapy (Agnelli et al., 2012) 
2.Person responsible for implementation of replication in Aetion
Dureshahwar Jawaid, MPH implemented the study design in the Aetion Evidence Platform. She is not responsible for the validity of
the design and analytic choices. All implementation steps are recorded and the implementation history is archived in the platform.

5.Cohort Identification
5.[ADDRESS_994478] continuous enrollment during a baseline period of 180 days 
before initiation of rivaroxaban or warfarin (index date) . We will restrict the analyses to patients with a diagnosis of PE . 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation 
 New use of rivaroxaban, exposure, and warfarin, comparator, is defined as no use of either therapy in 180 days prior to index date .

•For Optum: July 01, 2011 – March 31, 2020 (end of available data)
5.2.2 Specify inclusion/exclusion  criteria for cohort entry and define the index date. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion

6.Variables
6.1 Exposure-related variables: 
Study drug:  
The study exposure of interest is initiation of rivaroxaban. New i nitiation will be defined by [CONTACT_126088] 6 months before treatment initiation (washout period). 
Comparator: 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
New initiators of warfarin, defined by [CONTACT_126089] 6 months. 
6.2 Covariates: 
•Age
•Sex
•Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days pr ior to
and including index date
Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and 
analysis. We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap between treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility analysis and the initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 (Appendix B).  
6.3 Outcome variables and study follow-up:  
6.3.[ADDRESS_994479]: (definitions provided in Appendix A): 
•Primary Outcome:  VTE
Safety outcomes of interest: 
1.Major bleeding
6.3.2 Study follow-up 
Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of cohort entry. Because adherence in the real-world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the primary analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
For the AT analyses, the follow-up will start the day after initiation of rivaroxaban and comparator and will continue until the earliest 
date of the following events: 
• The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, unless otherwise specified for selected outcomes,  
• The date of end of continuous registration in the database, 
• End of the study period, 
• Measured death event occurs, 
• Nursing home admission 
o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typi[INVESTIGATOR_126081] a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for 
cohorts for the same reason. 
• The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_8372] (rivaroxaban and comparator) plus a defined grace period (i.e., [ADDRESS_994480] prescription’s days’ supply in main analyses). 
• The date of augmentation or switching from exposure to comparator or vice versa or augmentation/switching to any other NOAC (e.g. switching from rivaroxaban to api[INVESTIGATOR_8373] a censoring event); 
o A dosage change on the index treatment does not fulfill this criterion 
o An added treatment that is not part of the exposure or comparator group does not fulfill this criterion  
 
 For the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the censoring based on the augmentation/switching and treatment discontinuation 
will be replaced with a maximum allowed follow-up time of 365 days.

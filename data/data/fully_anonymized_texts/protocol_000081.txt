Version 4/18/201 6 Strengthening Instrumental Extinction to Prevent Smoking Relapse  
 
PI: F. Joseph McClernon, Ph.D.  
Co-I: Zach Rosenthal, Ph.D.  
 Purpose of the Study  
The central objective  of the  project is to evaluate the effect of incorporating smoking  related  contexts 
into very low nicotine content ( VLNC ) cigarette  extinction trials on clinically relevant,  smoking -related 
outcomes. We will evaluate the effects of multiple context exposure (MCE)  on pre -quit nicotine 
dependence  and smoking be havior  and smoking cessation outcomes . It is postulated that g reater 
compliance with, and response to smoking VLNCs and greater decreases in craving across the course  of 
MCE and in the cue -reactivity assessment will be  associated with better smoking cessation outcomes.  
Background &  Significance  
Each year in the U.S., smoking leads to over 400,000  premature deaths and $[ADDRESS_143575] on  
knowledge of basic learning processes, treatment development, and policy.  
Smoking VLNCs has been shown to reduce nicotine dependence, decrease smoking behavior, and decrease brain reactivity to smoking cues. In clinical trials, smoking VLNCs with or without concomitant 
nicotine patch has shown some promise in improving cessation outcomes. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_127313], very little r esearch has sought to directly enhance or strengthen the effects of smoking VLNCs 
on clinically relevant smoking outcomes .  
MCE —in which participants smoke VLNCs while viewing contexts associated with smoking—can 
potentially increase the efficacy of smokin g VLNCs by [CONTACT_127338]. 
If MCE increases the effects of VLNC smoking, this would further support the hypothesis that 
instrumental extinction is responsible for the  observed effects. In regards to t reatment development, 
VLNCs have shown promise as a component of smoking cessation  intervention; to the degree that MCE 
can increase the effects of VLNCs, the proposed work will have significant  clinical impact. MCE -based

technology; this further increases the possible future impact of the study.  
Design & Procedures  
We propose to obtain consent from 3 00 a dult smokers interested in quitting smoking . Of those who give 
consent we expec t to identify 80 participants who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria with the aim 
of identifying 68 participants who provide useable data. During a phone screening interview, the study 
will be described in detail and preliminary participant characteristics (e.g. age, number of cigarettes per day) will be assessed. Those participants who meet criteria for participation will be invited to our o ffices 
for an informed consent and screening visit. Potential participants will be instructed to bring a valid 
government issued photo ID to the screening session to confirm age and identity. Identifying 
2 
Version 4/18/201 6 information from the phone screen for the participants who do not meet inclusion criteria will be kept 
until recruitment for this study is completed.  
Screening Session:  During the screening session all aspects of the study will be described to subjects and 
informed consent will be obtained. A standardized P owerPoint presentation will be used to discuss the 
procedures, risks and benefits with the participant as well as their rights as a research participant. If consent is given we will collect breath and saliva samples in order to verify smoking status and bl ood 
alcohol level (BAL). Questionnaires on smoking history, family smoking history, nicotine dependence, and m ood will be collected. Participants will also be asked about medical history and complete the Brief 
Medical History Questionnaire and the Patient Health Questionnaire. Indicating certain items , such as 
suicidal ideation, significant depression, significant anxiety, or eating disorder, on the Patient Health Questionnaire will trigger medical review by [CONTACT_127339]. Research staff will refer to the PrimeMD Evaluation Form when reviewing responses on the Patient Health Questionnaire.  Physiological measures such as heart rate, blood 
pressure,  weig ht, and height will also be measured to assess general health.  
Urine samples will be obtained in order to screen for illicit drug use and to assess pregnancy status. Use of illegal drugs will be exclusion criteria. Marijuana use will not be exclusionary, but participants must agree to not use marijuana 24 hours  prior to sessions and may not mix their marijuana with tobacco (i.e. 
blunts). Females who test positive for pregnancy will be excluded from the study  and be given options 
for smoking cessation programs . Participants will also be interviewe d regarding their smoking behavior 
including an assessment of contexts (places) in which they smoke .  
Among females, pregnancy at screening as measured by a urine test will be exclusionary. The QuickVue 
One-Step hCG Urine Test will be used and performed by  [CONTACT_127340]. Females of child bearing potential must agree to use 
appropriate contraception during the course of the study. They must further agree to notify the study 
staff if they become pregnant during the study.  
At the end of the screening session participants will complete a computer task where they will look at 
cigarette point of sale displays and indicate whether they would purchase an item in the display. We will collect eye tracking data using a Tobii X2 -60 eyetracker.  
Training Session :
 Participants have the opportunity  to complete the training session on the same day as 
the screening session or they may schedule the session for  a separate day.  Participants will be required 
to schedule the training session within [ADDRESS_143576] positive for alcohol will be excluded from participation 
that day.  Participants testing positive for alcohol on more than one occasion will be excluded from the 
experiment.  Blood pressure and weigh t will also be collected at this visit.   
3 
Version 4/18/201 6 Participants will complete a baseline assessment of cue -reactivity. Participants will view blocks of 
smoking and non -smoking environment and proximal cues and will complete craving assessments. 
During the task,  heart rate and  respi[INVESTIGATOR_127315] a BIOPAC system. Mood and 
withdrawal will be assessed at the end of the task.   
Participants will be introduced to the digital camera that they will use to  capture images of their 
personal environments  and will be given specific guidelines to follow while taking pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. All 
information regarding the recording of events, pi[INVESTIGATOR_127316], and camera operation (e.g. recharging, 
storage) will be reviewed. Any questions from participants regarding the use o f the camera will be 
discussed.  Participants will also be allowed to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_127317]. If participants choose to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_127318] a device other than the lab camera 
provided, the camera on the de vice must have a photo resolution of at least 72 dpi.  All participants will 
be given 2 disposable lighters with stickers attached reminding them to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_127319]. Participants will be asked to take the pi[INVESTIGATOR_127320] 1 -2 weeks in order to obtain 
enough useable photographs before returning to the lab for the camera return session.  
Camera Return Session/Randomization:
 Once participants have collected photographs of personal 
smoking environments  they  will return to the lab with the camera 1- 2 weeks  after the training session . 
The information from  the camera will be uploaded,  examined , and reviewed with the participant to 
ensure enough u seable pi[INVESTIGATOR_127321]. If the images are acceptable for use then they will continue 
with the visit. If the pi[INVESTIGATOR_127322].  
Once the camera is returned with acceptable pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], all participants will complete a brief task during 
which they will view a subset of the MCE - images  in order to increase the familiarity of the images . 
Craving will be assessed before and after the task. A fter dismissal from the  camera return session,  
participants will then be  randomized to the  EXT/MCE+ or EXT/MCE - group. Individuals in the MCE+ 
group will view smoking -related environments during the MCE sessions (see below); whereas individuals 
in the MCE - group will view control images.  
Group Assignment/Experimental Period: During the  three -week treatment period, half of the sample 
(n=40) will be randomly assigned to undergo six, 60 -minute sessions of multiple context extinction 
(MCE+) during wh ich they will view smoking -related environments and smoke their assigned cigarettes. 
The remaining 40 participants will undergo control MCE (MCE -) and smoke their assigned cigarettes . 
Participants will be provided with packs of VLNC cigarettes matching on menthol preference (SPECTRUM 
cigarettes NCR -200/NRC -201) and Nicoderm CQ ® nicotine patches (EXT) and we will obtain 
physiological measures. Nicotine patches will be obtained from local drugstores. Participants smoking ≥ 
10 cig/day and participants smoking < 10 cig/day will be provided with 21 mg/d and 14 mg/d nicotine 
patches, respectively. They will be instructed to smoke the same number of VLNCs as they smoked of 
their usual brand and to only smoke the VLNC cigarettes for the next three weeks. At the firs t MCE 
session, instructions regarding cigarette  and patch use will be discussed and participants will apply a 
nicotine patch prior to completing the MCE task.

Version 4/18/201 6 Women of child- bearing potential will undergo urine pregnancy testing again prior to applying the  
patch . 
MCE Sessions:  Participants will be asked to  smoke  the assigned cigarettes  for the next three weeks. 
During those three weeks they will come into the  lab for 2 visits per week  (at least 48 hours apart) to 
undergo MCE  and complete questionnaires . Participants will be instructed to return their remaining 
product , empty cigarette packs , and used patches  at each visit. Additional VLNC cigarettes and nicotine 
patches will be provided as needed at each visit . Smoking behavior  and patch use will be asses sed by 
[CONTACT_6270]- report using the Timeline Follow -Back procedure at each visit . CO, BAL, vitals , and weight will be 
measured  at the beginning of each MCE session . Following physiological measures, participants will be 
seated in front of a computer monitor. Participants will be video recorded during the session to gather 
data about their smoking behavior. Heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_127323] a BIOPAC system 
at the first and last MCE sessions. Participants will complete baseline craving and mood surve ys. 
Participants will view pi[INVESTIGATOR_127324]  (MCE+ condition) or nature environments  (MCE - condition)  and will be instructed to 
imagine they are in the location depi[INVESTIGATOR_127325]. There will be a total of [ADDRESS_143577] a 5 minute break and then resume the task. Partic ipants 
will be instructed to light and smoke a VLNC cigarette at  the beginning of the task and following block 2, 
the 5 minute break, and block 7  (4 cigarettes total) .  At the end of the session, CO, vitals, and withdrawal 
and mood will be assessed.  
At the end of the three week treatment period, participants will quit smoking while continuing to wear the nicotine patch.  
Post -Quit  Test Session :
 Participants will return to the lab following [ADDRESS_143578] ivity and withdrawal will be assessed  as done during baseline . Abstinence 
will be verified by [CONTACT_46761][INVESTIGATOR_127326] < 6 ppm . If the participant does not meet abstinence criteria, 
s/he will only receive compensation for completing the visit, not for maint aining abstinence .  
Abstinence Period Visits:  During a 10  week  abstinence period , participants will be followed  and will be 
provided with nicotine patches . Participants will return to the lab 1 week , 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 10 
weeks  following the quit day.  Participants wearing a 21 mg/d patch prior to quitting will step -down to a 
14 mg/d patch at [ADDRESS_143579]- quit and step -down again to a 7 mg/d patch at [ADDRESS_143580] -quit. 
Participants wearing a 14 mg/d patch prior to quitting will step -down to a 7 mg/d patc h at [ADDRESS_143581] changed their smoking behavior or thoughts about smoking. P articipants will be debriefed and referred 
to area resources if  additional cessation treatment is desired.

 Subject Recruitment & Compensation 
Potential participants will be recruited via community advertisements  and websites at Duke University 
Medical Center.  Participants will be recruited through flyers, direct mailings, television, radio, 
newspaper, bus, and on the i nternet (Craigslist advertisements, trianglesmokingstudies.com , 
ResearchMatch ). Potential subjects can complete an on -line Qualtrics screening survey accessed from 
our website, after which they will be called to either be told they were not eligible or to complete a phone screen.  During a phone screening interview, the study will be describe d in detail and participants 
will be asked questions over the phone to determine initial eligibility. If eligible and interested, they will be scheduled for an i nformed consent and  screening visit.  
Participants will receive no payment for the phone screening. Participants will receive  $[ADDRESS_143585] criter ia, and meet the minimum requirements for breath carbon monoxide levels  (or urinary 
cotinine levels). Individuals who do not pass these tests will be dismissed from the screening session 
without payment. Participants will receive  $25 each for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_127327], $30 for each MCE Session, $ [ADDRESS_143586] session , $50 for meeting criteria for 24 
hour abstinence , and $30 for each abstinence period visit. The total amount earned for completing all 
sessions of the study is $ 435. The only payments received in cash are the payments dispensed at the 
screening session ($10) and post -quit test session ($25 for session, $50 for meeting abstinence criteria). 
All other payment will be received by [CONTACT_127343] t he study. Participants will receive $10 
for completing the 6 month follow -up phone call. Total compensation for attending sessions and 
completing all phone calls is up to $ 445. 
Consent Process  
The PI,  Research Coordinator, or R esearch Assistant  will obtain consent from each participant. The 
person obtaining consent provides the participants with a written document explaining the procedures 
and risks, and  reviews the PowerPoint presentation and answers any questions. A signed copy of the 
informed consent form will be given to each participant.  Participants are informed that they may 
withdraw from participation in the study at any time without penalty.   
The consent process will occur at our lab during regular business hours. There will be one participan t in 
a room along with the study staff member obtaining consent. The door is kept closed for privacy. 
7 
Version 4/18/201 6 Participants are  given as much time as needed to fully understand what is involved in  the study as well 
as their rights as research participants.  Particip ants are encouraged to ask as many questions as 
necessary to gain a complete understanding of the study. No one is coerced into the study, we make it 
very clear that participation is voluntary and they can choose to withdraw at any time.  
Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Potenti al risks of participation include:  
1. Breach of Confidentiality: The risk of the interview is loss of privacy if other people find out the 
results.  
2. Smoking study cigarettes : Participants may experience some minor adverse health effects such 
as he adaches or experience withdrawal symptoms which are listed below. In addition, due to 
the altered nicotine levels, there could be a change in their cigarette use including the manner 
in which they inhale the smoke or increase the number of cigarettes smoke d per day. This 
increased rate of smoking may persist after completing the study . Smoking the study cigarettes 
does not provide any less risk than their usual brand cigarette and could pose increased health 
risks. Participants may also experience increases  in carbon monoxide, a gas from smoke.  
3. Nicotine patch: Insomnia and abnormal dreams are common and expected side effects 
associated with [ADDRESS_143587] complains of disturbed sleep, s/he will be 
instructed to remove th e patch at bed time and apply a new one the next day at the usual time. 
Skin irritation may occur, although this will be minimized by [CONTACT_127344]. If a subject develops itching or a rash at the patch site, s/he will be advised to 
use 1% h ydrocortisone cream on the affected area. Symptoms associated with nicotine toxicity 
include lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, fainting and vomiting. Symptoms considered 
moderate to severe in nature will be evaluated by [CONTACT_127345]. Upon evaluation, the 
participant may be given the choice of continuing in the study at a lower dose patch. I f it is 
thought that being in this study is putting the participant’s health at risk, they may be asked to 
stop participating in the study . 
4. Smoking Withdrawa l: Participants may experience smoking withdrawal symptoms during this 
study. The symptoms can be uncomfortable but are typi[INVESTIGATOR_127328]. At each visit, they will be asked how they feel, and if it is thought that being in this study is putting the ir health at 
risk, they may be asked to stop participating in the study. Smoking withdrawal symptoms include:  
(a) Anger, irritability, frustration 
(b) Anxiousness, nervousness  
(c) Depressed mood or sadness  
(d) Desire or craving to smoke  
(e) Difficulty concentrating  
(f) Increased  appetite, hunger or weight gain  
(g) Insomnia, problems sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_127329]  
(h) Restlessness 
(i) Impatience  
8 
Version 4/18/201 6 (j) Constipation  
(k) Dizziness  
(l) Coughing 
(m) Dreaming or nightmares  
(n) Nausea  
(o) Sore Throat  
5. Risk to Fetus: To avoid risks to a fetus, pregnant women will be excluded from this study. Risks 
include miscarriage, preterm delivery, stillbirth, low birth weight, problems with the placenta, 
birth defects such as cleft palate, sudden infant death syndro me (SIDS), and early childhood 
behavioral problems.  If a participant becomes pregnant during the study she will be withdrawn 
from the study  and referred to area quit resources . Approximately [ADDRESS_143588] t he participant to confirm her due date. The licensed 
medical professional will follow -up with the participant after delivery to ask questions about the 
baby’s health.  
6. Changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate: Smoking and nicotine can affect the cardiovascular system which may result in changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate.  These changes will be 
monitored and may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_127330] (resting heart rate persistently greater than 
100 beats per minute).  
7. Exacerbation of psychiatric symptom s: Smoking and nicotine can affect a person’s mood and 
emotions and are associated with psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder and eating disorders. Any changes in nicotine or 
cigarette consump tion could adversely affect psychiatric conditions.  
A possible benefit from participation in the study is quitting smoking.  
Costs to the Subject  
There are no costs to participants for taking part in this study.  All the study costs, including any 
procedure s related directly to the study, will be paid for by [CONTACT_1758].  Moreover,  there are no 
immediate benefits from participating in the study.     
Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations  
The primary aim of this study  will evaluate the effects of MCE+ (vs. M CE-) on pre -quit nicotine 
dependence  and smoking behavior,  and smoking cessation outcomes. The premise is  that the EXT/MCE+ 
will result in greater decreases in pre -quit nicotine dependence and smoking behavior and better 
cessation outcomes as  compared to t he EXT/MCE - group. Secondarily, we will examine reactivity 
(craving, physiology) in response to  a set of standard smoking cues following abstinence and 
hypothesize less reactivity in the MCE+ group.  
With the second aim of the study  we will investigate whether among participants in the EXT/MCE+ 
group, EXT engagement  (compliance with smoking VLNCs), EXT response (decrease in smoking 
behavior), MCE response (decreased  craving across MCE sessions), and post -quit cue -reactivity predict 
smoking cessation outcomes. The proposition is greater compliance with, and response to smoking 
9 
Version 4/18/201 6 VLNCs and greater decreases in craving across the course  of MCE and in the cue -reactivity assessment 
will be associated with better smoking cessation outcomes.  
Data & Safety Monitoring  
Data capture will occur in several ways. All source documents will be stored in the participant binders . 
Research materials include questionnaires, expi[INVESTIGATOR_127331],  and urine samples for  drug and pregnancy screens. Research data without 
identifiers will be maintained in a locked room  and on password -protected computers in the research 
staff workplace, with only numeric codes identifying subjects. Study consent forms and any PHI will be 
stored in a locked file cabinet in a separate location from the study data. T he link between the 
participants’ names and codes will be stored on a password protected spreadsheet on a secure server. 
All information collected as part of this study will be accessible only to research staff. The Subject 
Identifier will be a numeric code that will include information about study number and subject ID number.  
It will be made clear to participants that all information obtained during assessments is co nfidential and 
that no information will be shared with the participants’ clinicians unless the participant requests this in writing. All investigators and staff associated with this project have been trained, and new hires will be trained, on human researc h ethics in accordance with the requirements of the local institutions.  
To ensure minimal missing data, the first time that participants complete the questionnaires, the 
Research Assistants will go over the questionnaires to ensure that participants unders tand the 
questions. Questionnaires will be reviewed for completeness while the participant is present. Several 
biochemical measures (expi[INVESTIGATOR_113179], urine pregnancy and drug screens) will be analyzed 
immediately, while the participant is present. If necessary (e.g., if the sample volume is insufficient for 
analysis), the Research Assistant will try to obtain another sample.  
A study participant may be discontinued from the study if the medically responsible investigator determines it is the best decision in order to protect the safety of a participant . While participating in 
the trial, adverse events will be assessed at every study visit. All events will be documented and followed up.  Events attributed to study product will be reviewed  and followed until appropriate medical 
resolution.  The study physician will review and sign off on all adverse events and problems as they 
occur. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_127332]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_127333] s prior to a participant’s completion of the study. Monitoring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_127334].  
Privacy, Data Storage & Confidentiality  
Participants will be informed, in their consent forms, of the data storage and conf identiality safeguards, 
which are practiced according to current HIPAA regulations. Except when required by [CONTACT_2371], the 
participant will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], social security number, address, telephone number or any other direct personal identifiers in t he study records. [CONTACT_127348] at UPMC will be a collaborator 
for the study. She is listed as outside key personnel and will not have access to any study PHI or identifiable information.

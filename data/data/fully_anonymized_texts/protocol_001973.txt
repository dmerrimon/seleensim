Title : A Phase 1/2 Multi -Center Study  Evaluating the Safety  and Efficacy  of 
KTE- X19 in Adult Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory  B-precursor
Acute Ly mphoblastic Leukemia (r/r ALL) (ZUMA -3)
Indication : The indication is for the treatment of adult subjects with B-precursor r/r 
ALL .
Study Design : ZUMA -3 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open- label study  evaluating the 
safet y and efficacy of KTE -X19 in adult subjects with relapsed or 
refractory  B-precursor ALL.  In this study , relapsed or refractory  is 
defined as one of the following: primary  refractory ;first relapse 
following a remission lasting ≤ 12 months; relapsed or refractory  after 
second -line or higher therapy ;relapsed or refractory  after allogenic 
SCT (provided the transplant occurred ≥100 day s prior to enrollment 
and that no immunosuppressive medications were taken ≤ 4 weeks 
prior to enrollment). 
Phase 1 Study
During Phase 1, approximately  3-12 subjects with high burden [M3 
marrow (>25% leukemic blasts) or ≥1000 blasts/mm3in the peripheral 
circulation] r/r ALL disease who are evaluable for D LT will be 
assessed to evaluate the safet y of KTE -X19.  A safety  review team 
(SRT) that is internal to the study  sponsor, and in collaboration with at 
least 1 study  investigator, will review safety  data and make 
recommendations regarding further enrollment in Phase 1 or 
proceeding to Phase 2 based on the incidence of DLTs and overall 
safet y profile of KTE
-X19.  Up to approximately  40 additional subjects 
with high or low burden disease may  be enrolled to further assess 
safet y (see Figure 1, Section 3.1and Section 9.6).  
Phase 2  Study
During Phase 2, approximately  50 subjects in the modified- intention to 
treat (mITT) set will be assessed to evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of 
KTE- X19.   
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review 
safet y data through one interim anal ysis during the Phase [ADDRESS_1204583] will follow the same study  treatment schedule and procedural 
requirements, independent of the phase of the study , and proceed 
through the following study  periods:

Study Objectives : Phase 1 Study
The primary  objective of Phase 1 is to evaluate the safet y of KTE -X19.  
Phase 2 Study
The primary  objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate the efficacy  of 
KTE- X19, as measured by [CONTACT_863883] (CR) and complete remission with incomplete 
hematologic recovery  (CRi) in adult subjects with r/r ALL 
(Appendix 1).  Secondary objectives will include assessing the safet y 
and tolerability  of KTE -X19 and additional efficacy  endpoints.
Hypothesis: This study  is designed to differentiate between a treatment that has a 
true overall complete remission rate of 40% or less and a treatment 
with a true overall complete remission rate of 65 %or more. The 
hypothesis is that the overall complete remission ra te to KTE -X19 is 
significantl y greater than 40%.
Primary 
Endpoints :Phase 1: I ncidence of adverse events (AEs) defined as dose -
limiting toxicities (DL Ts) in the DLT evaluable set
Phase 2:  Overall complete remission rate (CR + CRi) per 
independent review (Appendix 1)
Secondary 
Endpoints :Overall complete remission rate (CR + CRi) per investigator 
assessment ( Appendix 1)
Duration of Remission (DOR)
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negative rate
Allogeneic stem cell transplant (Allogeneic SCT) rate
Overall survival (OS)
Relapse -free Survival (RFS)

with high or low burden disease may  be enrolled to further assess 
safet y (see Figure 1, Section 3.1and Section 9.6).  
During Phase 2, approximately  50 subjects in the modified -intention to 
treat (mITT) set will be assessed to evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of 
KTE
-X19.   
An independent Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review 
safet y data through one interim anal ysis during the Phase [ADDRESS_1204588] been treated with KT E-X19 and had the 
opportunity  to be followed for 30 day s after the KTE -X19 infusion.  
Statistical 
ConsiderationsThe primary  endpoint for the Phase 2 study  is the overall complete 
remission rate (CR and CRi) per independent review ( Appendix 1).  
This endpoint will be based on a mITT population consisting of 
all 
Phase 2 subjects who receive KTE -X19 dose (see Section 10.5).  
This study  uses a single-arm design to test for an improvement in 
overall complete remission rate.  For the test of efficacy  this study  has 
approximately  93% power to distinguish between an active therapy  
with a 65 %true overall complete remission rate from a therapy  with an 
overall complete remission rate of 40% or less with a 1
-sided alpha 
level of 0.025.  
During Phase 1, the SRT will review safety  data after 3 subjects in t he 
DLT evaluable set (see Section 10.5) have had the opportunity  to be 
followed for 28 day s after the KTE -X19 infusion (see Section 9.6).  
During Phase 2, one interim and one primary  analy sis will be 
performed.  The interim anal ysis is for safety  only and will be 
performed b y the DSMB after [ADDRESS_1204589] -negative rate of 30% if the testing of the prima ry endpoint is 
significant.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 16of 100 31October [ZIP_CODE]. OBJECTIVES
The primary  objective of Phase 1 is to evaluate the safet y of KTE -X19.  
The primary  objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate the efficacy  of KTE -X19, as measured by  [CONTACT_863886] (CR) and complete remission with 
incomplete hematologic rec overy  (CRi) in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory  B-precursor 
acute l ymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL) .  Secondary  objectives will include assessing the safet y 
and tolerability  of KTE- X19,additional efficacy  endpoints, and change in EQ -5D scores .
KTE- C19 Kite Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol KTE -C19-[ADDRESS_1204596] 20% l ymphoblasts in the bone man ow (Harris et al, 1999 ). 
ALL is then further classified into 1 of 3 m ajor subtypes by [CONTACT_863887]: B-precursor 
ALL (70%), mature B-cell ALL (Burki tt lymphoma; 5%), and T- cell ALL (25%) . B-cell ALLs 
are generally CDIO +, CD19+, and CD79a+, although precursor B-cell ALL s may be C D10 -. 
Mature B-cell ALLs additionally express surface immun oglobulin (lg). T-cell ALL s express 
T-cell markers such as CD3, C D4, and CD8. The 3 immun ophenotypic subtypes are assoc iated 
with no n-overlappin g prognoses and ti·eatments making the class ification clini cally rel evant 
(National Comp rehensi ve Cance r Netwo rk 2014). B-precursor ALL compri ses the m ajority of 
all adult ALL cases . 
2.3. Philadelphia Positive vs. Negative ALL 
Approximately 20-30% of adults and a sma ll percentage of childr en w ith ALL are Philadelphia 
chrom osome positive (Ph+), and the m ajority of Ph+ cases are of B-cell lineage (Lee et al, 2011). 
Ph+ status confers poor prognosis, with a 5- year event-free smv iv al (EFS) rate of 36% vs 16% 
and an OS rate of 41 % vs. 22% in Philadelphia chrom osome n egative (Ph-) vs. Ph+ patients 
(Moonnan et al, 2007 ). Ph+ status also allows for additional ti·eatment with Abl tyros ine kinase 
inhibitors (TKis) such as imatinib or dasat inib.

hematopoiesis, prevent emergence of resistant subclones, eliminate minimal residual disease, and
provide proph ylaxistosanctuary  sites.  Stem cell tra nsplant also play s a role in the management 
of ALL, and t yrosine kinase inhibitors are added to chemotherap y and transplant regimens in 
patients with Ph+disease.
2.4.1. First -line Treatment
Most first- line regimens are a variation of either the B erlin-Frankfurt -Münster /Children’s 
Oncology  Group (BFM/COG) regimens, which include a combination of vincristine, an 
anthracy cline, a corticosteroid, and L -asparaginase, or the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 
(CALGB )regimens, which include the 4 drug classes above plus cy clo phosphamide (Larson et 
al, 1995 ; Rowe et al, 2005).  A TKI such as imatinib is included in the treatment regimen for 
patients with Ph+disease.  Dexamethasone appears to decrease the risk of CNS relapse and 
improve EFS compared to prednisone, but at the risk of increased toxicity  and no OS advantage
(Mitchell C. D. et al, 2005 ; Pui 2006 ).  The hy per-CVAD regimen which has demonstrated 
efficacy  in ALL is a variation on the CAL GB regimen with alternating regimens of 
hyperfractionated cy clophosphamide, vincr istine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone with high-
dose methotrexate and cytarabine (Kantarjian et al, 2004 ).  First -line regimens y ield CR rates of 
80-90% in adults.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_863839] a median duration  of first remission of at least 
[ADDRESS_1204598] relapsed or refractory  ALL.  Second -line 
chemotherap y yields remissions in about 20-40% of patients, with the remission rate being lower 
in patients who relapse within 12 months of an ini tial response (Table 1).  
In the third line and bey ond setting, complete remissions with chemotherapy  are seen in at most 
20% of patients, and the majority  of remissions are short lived (Thomas et al, 1999 ; Kantarjian et 
al, 2003 ; Fielding et al, 2007
; Tavernier et al, 2007 ; Faderl et al, 2011 ; O'Brien et al, 2013).  
Although long -term disease free survival ( DFS)rates of autologous stem cell transplantation 
(ASCT)are superior to chemotherap y in the salvage setting (approximately 40% vs 20%), onl y 
30-40% of patients who achieve a second CR are eligible for SCT, and fewer than half of the 
patients who achieve a second CR have enough time prior to relapse to make it to transplant
(Herzig et al, 1987 ; Kolb et al, 2009 ; Terwey  et al, 2009 ), with rates as low as 5% in adults being 
reported in some series (Thomas et al, 1999 )
.  
In December 2014, the bispecific CD19 -directed CD3 T -cell engaging agent blinatumomab was 
granted accelerated approval in the US for the treatment of Ph-relapsed or refractory  B-cell 
precursor ALL (blinatumomab USPI ).  The approval was granted based primarily  on findings 
from a single -arm study  of 185 evaluable patients w ith r/rB-precurso r ALL (relapsed with first 
remission duration of ≤[ADDRESS_1204599]).  CR was achieved in 32% of patients, and an 
additional 9% had CR h.  The majority of responses (81%) occurred within cy cle 1 of treatment, 
75% of those with CR/CRh had an minimum residual disease ( MRD )
-negative response, and the 
SCT rate among those who achieved CR/CRh was 39%.  Duration of response/relapse -free 
survival in patients who had CR/CRh was 5.9 months.  Results from a second study  of

Several studies have shown that the achievement of a minimum residual disease ( MRD )-negative 
response (<0.01% l ymphoblasts in the bone marrow) with ALL treatment is associated with 
prolonged leukemia remission in both pediatric and adult ALL patients (Campana 2010; 
Cazzaniga et al, 2011 ).  However, not all subjects who achieve a morphological complete 
remission achieve a MRD -negative remission.  I n a large study  by [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology  
Group randomizing p atients to different induction and maintenance regimens, 1788 o f
2422 
(74%) of subjects who had a remission (<10% bone marrow blasts) achieved MRD -negative 
status 
(Borowitz et al, 2015 ).  Treatment with the bispecific T cell engager blinatumomab 
produces a similar proportion of MRD-negative responses, 8 of 14 (53%) pediatric patients with 
a CR had an MRD -negative response {von Stackelberg 2016}.  Minimum residual disease-
negative rates are similar in adults.  With blinatumomab, 60 o f73 (82%) adult patients who 
achieved a CR or CRh had an MRD
-negative response.
2.5. Study Rationale
Most advanced cancers eventually  become refractory  to conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_863840].  Immunotherap y, which is based on the enhan cement of an 
immune response against the tumor, is a promising approach to treating many  cancer t ypes.  
Tcells play  an important role in destroy ing diseased cells throughout the body .  Studies with 
immune checkpoint inhibitors and tumor infiltrating l ymphocy tes have demonstrated the 
potential of T cells to treat cancer.  T cells need to possess the appropriate specificit y for a tumor, 
be present in sufficient numbers, and overcome any  local immunosuppressive factors to be 
effective.  Engineered T cells are a promising approach for cancer therap y (Kershaw et al, 2013
).
Engineered Autologous Cell Therap y (eACT ™) is a process b y which a patient’s own T cells are 
collected and subsequently  genetically  altered to recognize and target antigens expressed on the 
cell surface of specific malignancies (Kochenderfer et al, 2013 )
. The ability to geneticall y 
engineer human T cells and use them to mediate cancer regression in patients has been 
demonstrated in a number of studies (Davila et al, 2014 ; Maude et al, 2014 ; Lee et al, 2015 )and 
has opened possibilities for the treatment of patients with a wide vari ety of cancer t ypes 
including B-cellmalignancies expressing the CD19 antigen.
Given the poor outcomes which have been achieved to date in adults with r/rALL (Table 1 ), this 
trial will enroll adult s ubjects with r/rB-precursor ALL as evidenced b y failure to achieve or 
maintain a response to prior sy stemic therapy , or by  [CONTACT_863888].Patients 
with T -cell lineage ALL will not be enrolled since their malignancies are CD19-and will likely
not resp
ond to a CD19 directed agent.  
2.5.1. CD19 and E xpression
CD19 is a [ADDRESS_1204602] plasma cells.  The pattern of CD19 
expression is maintained in B
-cellmalignanc ies including all subt ypes of B-cellnon-Hodgkin 
lymphoma ( NHL ), chronic ly mpho cytic leukemia (CLL), and non 
T-cellacute ly mpho blastic 
leukemia (ALL) (Blanc et al, 2011) with the exception of multiple my eloma.

3.1. General Study Design
ZUMA -3 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open- label study  evaluating the safet y and efficacy of 
KTE- X19 in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory  B-precursor ALL. In this study , relapsed 
or refractory  is defined as one of the following: primary  refractory ; first relapse following a 
remission lasting ≤ 12 months; relapsed or refractory  after second- line or higher 
therap y;relapsed or refractory  after allogenic SCT (provided the transplant occurred ≥ 100 day s 
prior to enrollment and that no immunosuppressive medications were taken ≤ 4 weeks prior to 
enrollment) . 
During Phase 1, approximately  3-12 subjects with high burden [M3 marrow (> 25% leukemic 
blasts) or 
≥1000 blasts/mm3in the peripheral circulation] r/r ALL disease who are evaluable for 
DLT will be assessed to evaluate the safet y of KTE -X19. A SRT that is internal to the study  
sponsor, and in collaboration with at least 1 study  investigator, will review safet y data and make 
recommendations regarding further enrollment in Phase 1 or proceeding to Phase 2 based on the 
incidence of DLTs and overall safety profile of KTE -X19.  Additional ly, approximately  
40
subjects with high or low b urden disease may  be enrolled to further assess safet y(see 
Figure 1and Section 9.6).  
During Phase 2, approximately  50 subjects in the mI TT set will be assessed to evaluate the 
efficacy  and safet y of KTE -X19.  
In total, up to approximately  100 subjects may  be enrolled and treated with KTE -X19 in the 
study  in Phase 1 and 2 combined (see Section 9.6and Section 10.5).  
During Phase 2, oneinterim and one primary  analy sis will be performed.  The i nterim anal ysis is 
for safety  only and will be performed b y an independent DSMB after 20 Phase 2 subjects hav e 
been treated with KTE- X19 andhad the opportunity  to be followed for 30 day s after the 
KTE- X19 infusion (see Section 10.7).  Additional interim a nalyses for safety  may  be requested 
by [CONTACT_4318].  
The primary  anal ysis will occur when the overall study  enrollment is complete and the last 
treated subject in the mITT set has had the opportunity  to complete the month 6 disease 
assessment (see Section 10.8).  
Each subject will provide consent and be evaluated for study participation. Once deemed 
eligible and enrolled into the study , each subject 
will follow the same study treatment schedule 
and procedural requirements, independent of the phase of the stud y, and proceed through the 
following stud y periods:

3.4. Replacement of Subjects
Subjects will continue to be enrolled until the specified numbers of subjects are attained in the 
DLT evaluable ( Phase 1) and mITT sets ( Phase 2).
Subjects who have not received the required dose of KTE- X19 in order to be included in DLT

6_ PROTOCOL TREATMENT 
6.1. Treatment Terminology 
The following te1ms will be used to describe and define protoco l treatment: 
• Bridging chem otherapy refers to treatment used to control a subject's disease prior to 
conditioning chemo therapy. 
• CSF prophylaxis will be admini stered prior to infusion of conditioning chem otherapy . 
• The Conditioning chem otherapy regimen used for this study will be fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide. 
• The investigational p roduct for this study is named KTE- X19. 
6.2. Leukapheresis (within approximately 5 days of eligibility confirmation) 
Before leukapher esis commences, the criteria out lined in Section [ADDRESS_1204614] be m et. 
Subjects will undergo leukapher esis to obtain leukocytes (white blood cells) for the manu facture 
of KTE- X19. Leukapheresed cells obtained from subj ects at paiiicipating centers will be 
shipped to th e Cell Process ing Facility (CPF) overnight as described in the 1PM. 
The leukapheresed cells ai· e then 
packaged for expe dited shipment to the C PF as described in the 1PM. 
See Section 6.8 for excluded medications prior to leukapheresis. 
6.3. Bridging Chemotherap y 
Bridging therap y may be admini stered after leukapheresis and prior to conditioning 
chemotherap y at the investigators discretion. Bridging chemo therapy is recollllllended for all 
subjects paii icul ai·ly those subjects with high di sease burden at baseline [M3 maITow (>25% 
leukemic blasts) or 1000 blasts/mm3 in the peripheral circulation]. If prescribed, bridging 
chemo therapy must be admini stered after leukapheresis and completed at least 7 days or 5 ha lf-
lives, whichever is sho1ier, prior to initiating conditioning chem otherapy .

6.4. CSF Prophylaxi s 
All subjects will receive CSF prophylaxis consisting of an intrathecal regime n according to 
institutio nal or national guidelines (eg, methoti·exate 12 to 15 mg, cytosine arabinoside 40 mg, or 
dexamethasone 4 mg or equivalent steroid dose). 
CSF prophylaxi s will be admin istered any time durin g screening ( eg, at time of screening lumbar 
punct ure) through [ADDRESS_1204615] (KTE -X19) must be available before initiation of 
conditioning chemotherapy.
See Sec tion [IP_ADDRESS] for conditioning chemotherapy procedures. 
6.5.1. Fludarabine
Fludarabine phosphate is a sy nthetic purine nucleoside that differs from phy siologic nucleosides 
in that the sugar moiety  is arabinose instead of ribose or deoxy ribose.  Fludarabine is a purine 
antagonist antimetabolite.
6.5.2. Cyclophosphamide
Cyclophosphamide is a nitroge n mustard -derivative alky lating agent.  Following conversion to 
active metabolites in the liver, cy clophosphamide functions as an alk ylating agent; the drug also 
possesses potent immunosuppressive activit y.  The serum half -life after IV administration rang es 
from 3-12 hours; the drug and/or its metabolites can be detected in the serum for up to 72 hours 
after administration.  
6.5.3. Mesna
Mesna is a detoxify ing agent used to inhibit the hemorrhagic cy stitis induced by  [CONTACT_11553] .  
The active ingredient in mesna
is a s ynthetic sulfhydryl compound designated as sodium-2-
mercaptoethane sulfonate with a molecular formula of C 2H5NaO 3S2.  Mesna will be administered 
around the cy clophosphamide dose according to institutional standards.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 34of 100 31October [ZIP_CODE].5.4. Rationale for Conditioning Chem otherapy Choice and Dose
The rationale for the conditioning chemotherap y regimen and dose selection is based on the 
Phase 1 study  conducted at the Pediatric Oncology Branch at the NCI (Lee et al, 2015 ).In this 
study , 21 subjects (20 with ALL) were treated and all received the same fluda rabine and 
cyclophosphamide schedule with a favorable benefit/risk profile. 
Consistent with the NCI  protocol (Lee et al, 2015 ), the KTE-X19- 103 study will use the same 
Conditioning chemotherapy  regimen consisting of fludarabine at a dose of 25 mg/m2/day IV over 
30 minutes on Day -4, Day  - 3, Day  -2 prior to KTE -X19 and cy clophosphamide at a dose of 
900mg/m2/day 
IV over [ADDRESS_1204616] day .  The 
3-day conditioning chemotherap y regimen may be administered in an outpatient setting in 
accordance with the daily  dosing instructions outline din Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Following completion of each subjects’ conditioning chemotherap y regimen, subjects will 
receive their respective KTE
-X19 infusion.  
6.6. KTE -X19
The IP for this study is KTE -X19.
Refer to the most current Investigator’s Brochure regarding KTE -X19 and clinical 
experience.   This section contains general information and is not intended to provide specific 
instructions.  Refer to the IPMfor details and instruction on storage and administration of 
KTE
-X19.  
KTE- X19 is supplied cr yopreserved in cry ostorage bags.   
  The cryostorage bags containing KTE -X19 arrive frozen in 
a liquid nitrogen dry  shipper.  The bags must be stored in vapor phase of liquid nitrogen and the 
product remains frozen until the subject is read y for treatment to assure viable live autologous 
cells are administered to the subject . Several inactive ingredients are added to the product to 
assure viability  and sta bility  of the live cells through the freezing, thawing, and infusion process.
KTE- X19 is a subject -specific product and the intended subject will be identified by  a unique 
subject ID number.  Upon receipt, verification that the product and subject -specific labels match 
the 
subject ’sinformation (eg, initials, subject ID number) is essential.  Do not infuse the product 
if the information on the subject- specific label does not match the intended subject.  The volume 
of 
KTE- X19 infused, the thaw start/stop time, and KTE- X19 infusion start /stop time, will be 
noted in the subject medical record. The product must not be thawed until the subject is ready  
for the infusion.  
To date , subjects have received doses of anti- CD19 CAR T cells ranging from 0.5 - 30 x 106
anti-CD19 
CAR T cells/kg.  There have been no instances of accidental overdose of subjects in 
this program.  In case of accidental overdose, treatment should be supportive.   Corticos teroid 
therap y ma y be considered if an y dose is associated with severe toxicity (see Section 6.8 for 
more information related to corticosteroid use).

6.6.1. Rationale for KTE-X19 Dose 
In the ZUMA -3 study , the initial 6 subjects were ti·eated at 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CART cell/kg , 
with a su bseq uent group of 14 subjects ti·eated at 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CART cell/kg . No DLTs 
were obse rved in the DLT evaluable set, no drop off was seen in efficacy betwee n the 2 x 106 
anti-CD19 CART cell/kg and 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cell/kg KTE-X19 doses and there was 
no clear diffe rence in the safe rofile Section 2.8· Shah et al [ADDRESS_1204617] of the 
study. 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 of 100 31 October 2018

See Section 6.9regarding d ocumentation of subsequent anti cancer therapy .
6.8. Excluded Medications
Corticosteroid therap y at a pharmacologic dose (> 5 mg/day  of prednisone or equivalent doses of 
other corticosteroids) and other immunosuppressive drugs must be avoided for7 day s prior to 
leukapheresis and [ADDRESS_1204621] are contraindicated (ie, subjects with contrast allergy  or impaired renal clearance).  
If possible, such subjects should undergo non -contrast CT scans or alternative imagine modality  
(such as MRI) instead. 
Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs should also be avoided for 3 months after 
KTE
-X19 infusion, unless used to manage KTE -X19 related toxicities ( Refer to the most 
current version of the IB; see Section 6.4).  Other medications which may  interfere with 
evaluation of KTE -X19, such as non -steroidal anti -inflammatory  agents should also be avoided 
for the same time period unless medically  necessary .  
Therapeutic doses of s ystemic anticoagulants, such as unfractionated heparin and low -molecular 
weight heparin, should be avoided anytimesubjects are at risk of bleeding due to 
thrombocy topenia when possible.  I f a subject requires the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulant 
doses prior to initiation of conditioning chemotherapy  or prior to KTE -X19 infusion, then 
conditioning chemotherapy /KTE- X19 infusion must be held and the case discussed with the Kite 
Medical Monitor.
Forsubjects with Ph+ALL, all TKIs must be stopped at least [ADDRESS_1204622]’s leukemia such as chemotherap y, immunotherapy, targeted agents, 
radiation, high dose corticosteroid, other than defined/allowed in this protocol, and other 
investigational agents are prohibited except as needed for treatment of dis ease progression after
KTE- X19 infusion. If permissibility  of a specific medication/treatment is in question, contact 
[CONTACT_863892].
Medications with sedative properties should be avoided if possible in the setting of neurologic 
events (refer to the KTE- X19 IB).
6.9. Subsequent Therapy 
Subsequent therap y administered after KTE- X19 infusion for a subject s’disease such as non-
study  specified chemotherap y, immunotherapy, targeted agents ,as well as stem cell transplant 
and radiation therap y will be recorded for all enrolled subjects until one of the following 
occur:   subject completes the long term follow up period, is considered lost to follow up, 
withdraws consent, or dies .  
For subjects who are enrolled, but do not receive KTE
-X19 infusion, an y additional anti -cancer 
therap y will also be collected until subject completes the long term follow up period, is 
considered lost to follow up, withdraws consent, or dies.

An overview of study  assessments/procedures is outlined below. A description for each period
of the study  is provided in Section 7.11. Refer to the CRF completion guidelines for data 
collection requirements and documentation of study procedures.
7.1. Informed Consent
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study , the investigator is responsible for obtaining 
written informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the study  design, 
anticipated benefits and the potential risks. Subjects should sign the most c urrent Institutional 
Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee ( IRB/IEC )approved Informed Consent form 
(ICF)prior to any  study  specific activity  or procedure is performed.
Theconsent process and the subject’s agreement or refusal to participate in the study  is to be 
documented in the subject’s medical records. If the subject agrees to participate ,the ICF is to be 
signed and personally  dated by  [CONTACT_863893] d 
consent discussion. The original signed ICF will be retained in accordance with institution 
policy  and IRB/IEC requirements with a cop y of the I CF provided to the subject.
All subjects who are enrolled into the study  should be re -consented with any upda ted version of 
the IRB/IEC approved ICF if relevant to their participation in the study .
7.2. Demographic Data
Demographic data will be collected per country and local regulations and guidelines.  Where 
applicable, demographic data will include sex,year of bir th, race, ethnicity and country  of 
enrollment to study  their possible association with subject saf ety and treatment effectiveness .
7.3. Medical and Treatment History
Relevant medical history prior to the start of adverse event reporting will be collected. Relevant 
medical history  is defined as data on the subject’s concurrent medical condition that would be

Physical exam
s will be performed during screening and a t times noted . Changes 
noted in subsequent exams when compared to the baseli ne exam will be reported as an adverse 
event. 
During KTE
-X19 infusion /hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, 
oxygen saturation, and temperature will be monitored before and after the KTE- X19 infusion and 
then routinely  (every  4-6 hours) while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] . If the subject has a fever (temperature
38.3oCor greater ) at any  time during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], vital signs will be monitored more 
frequentl y as clinically indicated.
Performance status 
as measured b y the ECOG scale will be performed to qu antify  the subject’s 
general well -being and ability  to perform 
activities of daily  life.
The EQ -5D will be completed only  for subjects participating in phase 2.  The EQ -5D will be 
completed at the timepoints outlined in the SOA prior to other study  related procedures or 
assessments .  Subjects who are blind or illiterate may  have the EQ- 5D questions read to them by  
[CONTACT_39802].  The study staff, however, cannot interpret any  of the questions for the subject.  A 
subject may be exempt from completing the questionnaire if he or she is unable to read the 
questionnaire in one of the country  languages available.
The EQ -5D is a [ADDRESS_1204624].  The EQ -5D consists of a 5 dimension descriptive sy stem including questions on 
mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/comfort, and anxiety /depression and a visual analogue 
scale (EQ VAS) which allows the respondent to record health on a vertical scale (eg ,best health 
to worst health) thus allowing a quantitative measure of health outcome.   
7.5. Neuro logical Assessment 
Subject’s neurological status should be evaluated at screening to establish a base line.  After 
enrollment, subjects should be evaluated for an y neu rological s ymptoms at each of the 
timepoints specified in the SOA.  During the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60521], evaluations of neurological 
status may  need to be increased.   Changes in neurological status should be reported as an adverse 
event per Section 9.
7.6. Cardiac Function 
Each subject’s cardiac function as measured b y ECHO will be assessed during the screening 
period to confirm stud y eligibility . No evidence of pericardial effusion, as required b y 
eligibility ,
will also be confirmed by  [CONTACT_18585].  
If the last chemotherap y regimen the subject received is not considered cardiotoxic , then an 
ECHO performed within [ADDRESS_1204625] es will be collected at the time points indicated in the SO A. Addit ional samples 
( eg, blood, urine, other bodily fluids, tissue) may be collected as neede d for further safety testing.

Administration of KTE -X19 cells to subjects with ongoing infection or inflammation, even 
if such processes are asymptomatic, increases the risk of high grade and fatal toxicity.  All 
efforts should be made to rule out such conditions prior to cell infusion .  
Signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory results attributed to the malignancy ( elevated 
C-reactive protein [CRP]) are diagnoses of exclusion that require a documented workup to 
establish.  Conditioning chemotherapy and KTE- X19 infusion should only be ini tiated after 
it is reasonably assured that cell infusion can safely proceed.  
The investigational medicinal product (KTE -X19) must be available before initiation of 
conditioning chemotherapy.
Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for Requirements to Work -up Potential Infectious and/or 
Inflammatory States.

1 Vital signs: Includes blood pressure , heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature . Height will be collected at screening. Vitals will be monitored before and after the KTE-X19 
infusion and then routinel y (every 4-6 hours) while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36515]. If the subjec t has a fever (temperature 38.3oC or greater) at any time during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , vital signs will be 
monitored more frequently as clinically indicated. 
2 Bone M arrow Evaluation (biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) for Disease Assess ment (Section 7.9): For screening bone marrow evaluat ion see sectio n 7.9. 1. A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_863869] (Subj ects that recei ve an SCT, bone m arrow evaluati ons are not required for the first [ADDRESS_1204654]). In addition to the 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] , a bone marrow biopsy is required at Screening , Day -[ADDRESS_1204655]; see the central laboratory manual for details. The optional day [ADDRESS_1204656] igator per Append ix 1. If bone marrow blasts are~ S% and circulating blasts are,:: 1 %, then additional studies (eg, flow cytometry) should be performed 
to quantify the blasts . 
3 Extra medullary Imagi ng (Section 7.9.2 ): For subjects with known baseline extramedullary disease detected through imaging , baseline images appropriate for the anatomical location 
and clinical scenario will be performed. For subjects receiving bridging cliemotherapy , images will be performed after bridging chemotherapy and before conditioning chemotherapy. 
For subjects not receiving bridging chemotherapy , images will be performed within [ADDRESS_1204657] 's disease has not 
progressed by [CONTACT_43380] 24, then images will be performed per standard of care until disease progression. For subjects with or without extramedullary disease , images should be performed 
per standard of care anytime the subject presents with symptoms suggestive of disease progression. 
Lumb ar Puncture (Section 7. 7): CSF samples will be analyzed locally for disease assessment and centrally for disease assessment and toxic ity evaluation at the following timepoints : 
1) Baseline - a CSF result obtained within 30 days before enrollment will be acceptable eligibility determination, 2) at the time ofCSF prophylaxis, 3) for subjects with baseline CNS-[ADDRESS_1204658] presumed response based on bone marrow (bone marrow <5%), 4) first onse t of grade 2 or greater neurological symptoms or as 
medically indicated S) for subj ects with a CR, collection and analysis of CSF is required to confir m CR and 6) per institutional standard of care. Should a subject have an Ommaya 
reservoir and there is no evidence of blockage of CSF flow from the spi[INVESTIGATOR_158470], withdrawal of the CSF sample though the reservoir is acceptable . CSF samples (ie, collected on or 
after informed consent) will be submitted to the central laboratory. 
Leukapheresis (Sections 6.2 and 7.11.3) : All leukapheresis criteria must be met before leukapheresis commences . Vitals, weight, and laboratory sample draws may be 
da of 01· before leuka heresis , exc t wei t must be collected on da of leuka heresis . All laborato sam les should be drawn before the leuka heresis rocedure . 
(Section 6.3) will be administered after leukaphe resis and completed at least 7 days or 5 half-lives , whichever is shorter , prior to initiating 
con tiorung c emo erapy . CSF prophylaxis (Section 6.4) will be administered any time during screening through [ADDRESS_1204659] an Ommaya reservoir and there is no evidence of blockage of CSF flow from the spi[INVESTIGATOR_28947] l canal , administration of CSF prophylaxis 
through the reservoir is acceptable . Conditioning ch emot herapy (Section 6.5) consisting offludarabine on Day-4, -3, -2 prior to KTE-X19 and cyclophosphamide on Day -2 prior to 
KTE-X19 will be administered. 
Vita ls, Chem panel, and CBC: collected each day prior to CSF prophylaxis and bridging chemotherapy (see Section 7.11.4 and 7.11.S ). CBC 5-part preferred, but 3-part will be 
acceptable. Pe1ipheral blood : Peripheral blood will be collected at screening , and if the subject did not have bridging the rapy than pe1ipheral blood will be collected during day 
-4 and submitted to the central lab. 
8 Neurological assess ment: Subjects neurological status should be evaluated at screening to establish a baseline. After enrollment , subjects should be evaluated for any neurological 
symptoms at each of the timepoints specified in the SOA. During the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60521] , evalua tions of neurological status may need to be increased . 
9 Scree ning proced ures (Sectio n 7.11.1): Procedures should be performed within 14 days of enrollment (unless otherwise specified). ECG: must be performed within 30 days prior to 
enrollment ; ECHO: If the last chemotherapy regimen the subject received is not considered cardiotoxic , then an ECHO perform ed within [ADDRESS_1204660] chemotherapy treatment and 
within 28 days prior to signing the consen t may be used for confirmation of eligibility . CD19: Local CD19 immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_863870] . Surface CD19 express ion should be measured by [CONTACT_4133]; IHC analysis is allowed if the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_331543] a dry tap, inadequate or there were

CONFIDENT IAL Page [ADDRESS_1204664] the right to withdraw from the stud yat an y time and for an y reason without 
prejudice to their future medical care b y the ph ysician or at the institution .
Subjects can decline to continue to receiv estudy  required treatment and/or other protocol 
required procedures at any time during the stud y but continue to participate in the st udy. This is 
referred to as partial withdrawal of consent.
If partial withdrawal of consent occurs, the investigator must discuss with the subject the 
appropriate process for discontinuation from investigational product , study  treatment or other 
protocol required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_234775], completion of 
procedures and the associated data collection as outlined in the SOA .The level of follow -up and 
method of communication should also be discussed between the research s taff and the subject 
anddocumented in the source documents.
Withdraw of full consent for a stud y means that the subject does not wish to receive further 
protocol required therap y or undergo procedures and the subject does not wish to continue 
further stud y follow -
up. Subject data collected up to withdraw of consen t will be retained and
included in the anal ysis of the study , and where permitted by [CONTACT_427], publically
available data (death records) can be included after withdraw alof consent. The investigator is to 
discuss with the subject appropriate proc edures for withdrawal from the study .
As part of the stud y sites may be asked to conduct searches of public records, such as those 
establishing survival status, if available, to obtain survival data for any  subject for whom the 
survival status is not know n.Sites may  be also asked to also retrieve autopsy  reports to confirm 
status of disease at the time of death. 
The investigator a nd/or sponsor can also decide to withdraw a subject from the investigational 
product and/or other protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], protocol procedures, or the study  as a whole or 
at an y time prior to study completion.
8.1. Reasons for Removal from Treatment
Reasons for removal from protocol required investigational products or procedures include an y 
of the following:
Adverse Event
Subjec t request
Product not available
Lost to Follow -up
Death
Decision b y sponsor
KTE- C19 Kite Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol KTE -C19-[ADDRESS_1204665] from the stud y are as follows:
Subject withdrawal of consent from further follow-up
Investigator decision
Lost to follow -up 
Death
KTE- C19 Kite Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol KTE -C19-[ADDRESS_1204666]’s medical record. 
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre -existing medical condition. 
Worsening indicates that t he pre -existing medical condition has increased in severit y, frequency, 
and/or duration or has an association with a worse outcome.  When recording such events, 
provide descriptions that the pre -existing condition has changed (eg, more frequent 
headaches f
or a subject with pre- existing headaches or blood pressure is now more 
increased in a subject with pre -existing hypertension) .  A pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a 
medical procedure while on study , is not considered an adverse event
.
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (such as elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before stud y participation are not considered adverse events.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_863873].
The term “disease progression” or an y relapse after a remission should not be reported as adverse 
events. Death due to disease progression in the absence of signs and s ymptoms of underlying 
disease should be reported as the primary tumor t ype (e g , B-cell ty pe acute leuke mia).
For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to the disease under 
investigation report the signs and s ymptoms. Worsening of signs and s ymptoms of the 
malignancy  under stud y should also be reported as adverse events in the appropriate section of 
the CRF. 
The investigators clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is t o be removed from 
treatment due to an adverse event. In the event a subject requests to withdraw from protocol 
required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_863874], the subject should undergo the 
procedures outlined in the Month 3 visit of the SOA. 
9.1.1. Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms
For adverse events, a diagnosis (if known) rather than individual signs and symptoms 
should be recorded on the AE form.  The exception is for CRS where both the diagnosis 
and signs and symptoms will be captured on the CRF AE form.  For signs and symptoms of 
the underlying cancer, the signs and symptoms should be captured.  However, on the AE 
form, the investigator should state that these signs and symptoms are due to the underlying 
disease.
KTE- C19 Kite Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol KTE -C19-[ADDRESS_1204667] be 
reported as an adverse event if it is a change from baseline and meets any of the following 
criteria:
Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding if an isolated vital sign abn ormality should be 
classified as an adverse event.  However, if a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a 
sign of a disease or syndrome (eg, high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (ie, 
hypertension) should be recorded on the CRF.
9.1.3. Reporting Abn ormal Laboratory Findings
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant 
change from the subject’s baseline values.  In gene ral, abnormal laboratory findings 
without clinical significance (based on the investigator’s judgment) are not to be recorded 
as AEs.  However, abnormal laboratory findings that result in new or worsening clinical 
sequelae or that require therapy or adjust ment in current therapy, are considered AEs.  
Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as 
the AE.
An abnormal laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it is a change 
from baseline and mee ts any of the following criteria:
Associated with clinical symptoms
Results in a medical intervention (eg, potassium supplementation for hypokalemia or 
iron replacement therapy for anemia) or a change in concomitant therapy
Clinically significant in the in vestigator’s judgment 
9.2. Reporting of Adverse Events
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs observed b y the investigator or reported b y 
the subject as follows in Table 5:

See Section 9.5for reporting requirements.  
See Section 6.7for targeted concomitant medications and Section 9.5for targeted SAEs reporting requirements.
See Section 9.5for reporting requirement for non-serious CRS events Grade ≥ 3.
The investigator must address the below AEs: 
Adverse event diagnosis or sy ndrome (if not known, signs or s ymptoms)
Dates of onset and resolution
Severity
Assessment of relatedness to investigational product, chemotherap y or study procedures
Action taken
Adverse event grading scale used will be the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. A cop y of the grading scale can be downloaded from the CTEP 
home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ).Cytokine Release S yndrome events will also be reported 
using the grading scale outlined in the KTE- X19 IB. 
In reviewing adverse events, investigators must ass ess whether the adverse event is possibly  
related to 1) leukapheresis, 2) bridging chemotherapy , 3) CSF prophy laxis, 4) Conditioning
chemotherap y, 5) the investigational product ( KTE -X19), or any  protocol required stud y 
procedure. The relationship is indi cated by  a yes or no response and entered into the CRF. A 
yes response should indicate that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study  treatment or procedure and the adverse event. Additional relevant data with respect to 
descri bing the adverse event will be collected in the CRFs.
KTE- C19 Kite Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol KTE -C19-[ADDRESS_1204670] 1 of the following serious criteria:
Fatal
Life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)
Requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
An AE would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” if the event necessitated an 
admission to a healthcare facility  (eg, overnight stay ). 
Events that require an escalation of care when the subject is a lread y hospi[INVESTIGATOR_863875].  Examples of such events include movement from routine care in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_234779] (ICU) or if that event resulted in a prolongation of 
the existing planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Congenital anomal y/birth defect
Other medicall y important serious event
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any  of 
the serious criteria, the event could be c lassified as an SAE with the criterion of “other 
medically  important serious event.” 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity 
of an adverse event according to NCI CTCAE criteria; the event itself may be of 
relatively minor medical significance and, therefore, may not meet the seriousness 
criteria.  Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse 
event recorded on the CRF.
Progression of the malignancy  during the study  should not be r eported as a AE.However, 
signs and sympotms of disease progression may be recorded as AEs or SAEs and 
indicated as being due to disease progression in the CRF.  If the malignancy has a fatal 
outcome before the end of the SAE reporting period, the the eve nt leading to the death 
must be recorded as an SAE with the outcome of being fatal.

9.4. Reporting Deaths
Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE rep orting period, irrespective of any 
intervening treatment.
Any death occurring after the first dose of chemotherapy, for the purpose of 
pre-conditioning, and within 3 months of KTE -X19 infusion , regardless of attribution to 
treatment, requires expedited rep orting within 24 hours.  Any death occurring after the 
SAE reporting period requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is considered 
related to treatment.  
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period that are attribute d by 
[CONTACT_863906] “chronic lymphocytic leukemia” and must be reported 
immediately to the sponsor.  
Death is an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded on the AE form.  Every effort should 
be made to capture the established cause of death, which may become available later on 
(eg, after autopsy).
9.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse E vents
The investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs observed b y the investigator or reported b y 
the subject.  Unless otherwise indicated in Table 6 below, all SAEs will be reported within 
24hours and recorded in the CRF.

All SAEs must be submitted to Kite via email to  within 24 hours 
following the investigator’s knowledge of the event and using a SA E report form.
Subsequently , all SAEs will be reported to the health authorities per local reporting guidelines.
9.6. Pregnancy and Lactation
There is no relevant clinical experience with KTE -X19 in pregnant or lactating women, and 
animal reproductive studies h ave not been performed.  Women of child bearing potential must 
have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment because of the potentially dangerous effects of 
the preparative chemotherap y on the fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should be 
monitore d according to local and country -specific regulations.   This experimental therap y 
should not be administered to pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.

9.7. Safety Review Team and Dose -limiting Toxicity
The SRT ,that is internal to the study  sponsor and in collaboration with at least one stud y 
investigator, will be specifically  chartered to review safet y data from the first 3-12subjects 
treated with KTE -X19 and make recommendations on further study  conduct and pr ogression of 
the study  based on the incidence of KTE- X19 DLT and review of serious adverse events.
Dose -limiting toxicity  is defined as the following KTE-X19- related events with onset within the 
first 28 days following KTE -X19 infusion:
Grade 4 hematologic toxicit y lasting more than 30 days (except ly mphopenia) if not 
attributable to underl ying disease
AllKTE-X19-related grade 3 non- hematologic toxicities lasting for > 7 days and all 
KTE-X19- related grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities regardless of duration are considered 
DLTs, with the exception of the following which are not considered DLTs:
Aphasia/d ysphasia or confusion/cognitive disturbance which resolves to at least grade [ADDRESS_1204676] baseline within 4 weeks.  
Fever gra de 3 or 4
Immediate h ypersensitivity  reactions occurring within 2 hours of KTE -X19 infusion 
(related to KTE -X19 infusion) that are reversible to a grade [ADDRESS_1204677] therap y
Renal toxicity  which requires dialy sis for≤7 days
Intubation for airway  protection if ≤ 7 day s

CRS will be graded according to a revised grading s ystem ( Lee et al, 2014 ).  Adverse events 
attributed to CRS w ill be mapped to the overall CRS grading assessment for the determination of 
DLT.  Consistent with non- CRS toxicities, all occurrences of grade 3 CRS of duration > [ADDRESS_1204679] 28 days following the completion of the KTE- X19
infusion.  The anal ysis of D LTs will be based on the DLT evaluable set as defined in 
Section 10.5.  The SRT will make recommendations based on the incidence of DLT and overall 
safet y profile of the 
KTE -X19 regimen as outlined below :
If the subject incidence of DLT is 0 of 3 subjects, the SRT may  recommend either
proceeding to Phase 2at 2 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg ; or 
accrual of additional subjects in Phase 1 to further characterize risk/benefit prior to 
Phase 2
If the subject incidence of DLT is 1 of 3 subjects, the SRT may  recommend either
accrual of an additional [ADDRESS_1204680] been assessed 
for DLT
.  In this case, the SRT may  recommend accrual to Phase 2 if the cumulative 
incidence of DLT in the 6 subjects is ≤1 of 6 subjects; or 
evaluation of a lower dose of 1 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg in an additional set of 
3-6subjects .  In this case, the SRT may  recommend accrual to Phase 2 if the cumulative 
incidence of DLT is < 33%.
If the subject incidence of DLT is ≥ 2 of 3 subjects, a lower dose of 1 x 106anti-CD19 CAR
T cells/kg in an additional set of 3-6 subjects will be explored .  In this case, the SRT may  
recommend accrual to Phase 2 if the cumulative incidence of DLT is < 33%.

Phase 2. The data from these additional subjects will be reviewed b y the SRT who will provide 
recommendations for dose for Phase 2.  Further details to be outlined in the SRT Charter.
Based on the review of all available safety and efficacy data, the benefit/risk  ratio was 
considered most favorable  at the dose of 1 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg, therefore the 
dose of 1 x 106anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg was considered the recommended Phase [ADDRESS_1204681] (DSMB) will be chartered to review safet y data

10.1. Hypothesis
This study  is designed to differentiate between a treatment that has a true overall complete 
remission rate of 40% or less and a tr eatment with a true overall complete remission rate of 65% 
or more. The h ypothesis is that the overall complete remission rate to KTE- X19 is significantl y 
greater than 40%.
A secondary  endpoint, Minimum Residual Disease (MRD) Negative Rate, will be tested against 
a MRD- negative rate of 30% if the testing of the overall complete remission rate is significant.
The hy pothesis is that the MR D-negative rate to KTE -X19 is significantly  greater than 30%.

anti-CD19 CAR T cells /kgmay be administered.  Full Anal ysis Set:  the full analy sis set will 
consist of all enrolled subjects and will be used for summaries of subject disposition.
Modified Intent ion-to-treat Set (mI TT):  the modified intent ion-to-treat set will consist of all 
subjects enrolled in Phase 2and treated with KTE -X19.  ThemITT analysis set will be used for 
all efficacy  analy sesunless otherwise specified
.
DLT-evaluable set: All Phase [ADDRESS_1204688] infusion period, up to the time at which a dose level has been 
evaluated for DLT and deemed safe.  Additional Phase 1 subjects enrolled and treated 
subsequently  for the purpose of assessment of the overall safety  in the same dose level or a lower 
dose level will not be considered as part of the DLT evaluable set, and DLT will not be a ssessed 
for such subjects.
Safety  analysis set:  the safet y set is defined as all subjects treated with any dose of KTE- X19.
10.6. Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments
This is a single arm, open -label study  and subjects and investigators will be aware of treatment 
received. Data handling procedures will be devised to reduce potential sources of bias and 
maintain the validity  and credibility  of the study .These procedures will be outlined in the study  
statistical analy sis plan, DSMB c harter, and Trial I ntegrity  Document.
10.7. Interim Analysis
During Phase 1, t he SRT will review safety  data after [ADDRESS_1204689] 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals will be generated.  An 
exact binomial test will be used to compare the observed response rate to a response rate of 40%.
10.8.2. Duration of Re mission
Durati on of Remission (DOR): for subjects who experience CR or CRi per independent review, 
DOR is defined as the time between their first complete response per independent review to 
relapse or an y death in the absence of documented relapse.  Relapse is defined inAppendix 1.  
Subjects who do not meet the criteria for relapse and who have 
not died will be censored at the 
last evaluable disease assessment or di sease status follow up assessment. Disease assessments 
obtained after new anti- cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including allogeneic SCT) will not contribute to the 
derivation of duration of remission. The DOR for subjects that undergo allogeneic SCT while in 
remission i s censored at the date of the allogeneic SCT; the DOR for subjects that undergo other 
new anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_863879] -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Kaplan -
Meier estimates and 2 -sided 95% 
confidence intervals will be generated for DOR.  Estimates of the proportion of subjects 
remained as in complete remission at 3 -month intervals will be provided.
A sensitivity  anal ysis of DOR will be conducted in which non- disease mortality will be 
considered a competing risk. A competing -risk analy sis method (Klein and Moeschberger 2005 ; 
Putter et al, 2007 ) will be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse.  The cumulative 
incidence of relapse in the presence non -disease related mortality  (the competing risk) will be 
estimated along with 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals at [ADDRESS_1204690] 2- sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
generated.  If the statistical testing of the primary  endpoint (overall complete remission rate) is 
significant, an exact binomial test will be used to compare the observed MRD -negative rate to a

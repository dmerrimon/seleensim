Study Title: Duration of action and peak effect of high dose U -500 regular insulin in severely insulin resistant 
subjects with type 2 diabetes  
 
Version:  September 23, 2015 
 
• Introduction  
 With the epi[INVESTIGATOR_296547] 2 diabetes,  patients today frequently require large doses of insulin to 
achieve optimal glycemic control because of their severe insulin resistance. Such patients often require multiple injections exceeding 100 units at a time, which can cause discomfort and reduced adherence to therapy. Additionally, a large depot of subcutaneous insulin may delay its absorption (1). Because of the higher concentration of U -500 insulin compared to U100 insulin, patients are able to deliver the same amount of insulin 
in a much smaller volume, increasing patient satisfaction, adherence and improving glycemic control (2).  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_296548] U -[ADDRESS_362149] not been well 
studied, particularly in subjects with diabetes at clinically meaningful doses. De La Pena et al examined the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 50 and 100 unit doses of U -500 and U -100 insulin in healthy, non -
diabetic obese volunteers (3). They found that the peaks of the concentration and action profiles for U- [ADDRESS_362150] diabetes, and were excluded if they had a BMI >40 (a group that would be more likely to require high dose insulin).  
 Davidson et al. measured glucose, insulin and C -peptide levels in 9 severely insulin resistant subjects with  type 2 
diabetes after administration of 100 units of U- 500 insulin subcutaneously (4). Insulin concentrations rose by [ADDRESS_362151] is not known.  
 This paucity of data makes it difficult for clinicians to dose U- 500 safely and effectively. A prospective study 
lasting 24 hours or more is needed to better understand the duration of action of U -500 insulin. In this study,  we 
propose a double blind, crossover euglycemic clamp study in subjects with type 2 diabetes and severe insulin resistance using clinically relevant dosing to determine duration of action and peaks of U- 500 insulin. Such 
information would be of great bene fit to clinicians who wish to prescribe U- 500 insulin.  
 
• Objectives  
 
Primary Objective: To determine the duration of action of a single injection of 100 vs. 200 units U- 500 insulin in 
severely insulin resistant patients with type 2 diabetes.  
 Secondary Objective : To determine peak effect of a single injection of 100 vs. 200 units U -500 insulin in  severely 
insulin resistant patients with type 2 diabetes  
 • Research design  
 
What do we intend to do?  
This will be a single center double blind, crossover study in which subjects will be randomly assigned to 
receive [ADDRESS_362152] udy 
design is shown in Figure 1.  
  
How will we do the work?  
Following ascertainment of eligibility, potential participants will be sent a letter inviting them to learn more 
about the study. Individuals who contact [CONTACT_296566]. At that time the study will be reviewed in detail and informed consent will be obtained. 
If an HgbA1c has not been measured in the previous month, a sample will be collected for this measure during the screening visit. Subjects will then be scheduled for their first study day and instructed to avoid exercise 48 hours before the study. Directions for how to mana ge their diabetes medications will be given to 
the participant. These will be individualized based on the participant’s current regimen with the intention to discontinue all medications so none are present at the start of the study.  
 
Subjects will be admitted to Masonic Clinical Research Unit (MCRU) after dinner on the night (between 8 -10 
PM) before the study. Two catheters will be placed in the arms to establish intravenous access. One will be used for subsequent blood sampling and the other will be used for infusion. Blood glucose will be measured 
four hours after their dinner and intravenous insulin will be given as necessary to maintain blood glucose 
between 100 -150 mg/dL. Blood sugars will be obtained every 15 -60 minutes overnight to ensure the 
participant remains at target. At 7 AM (time 0) subjects will be given a blinded dose of either 100 or 200 units 
of U- 500 regular insulin subcutaneously. The randomization to dose and the preparation of the injection will 
be managed by [CONTACT_296567]. Blood glucose will be measured starting at time 0 and every 15 -
60 minutes and variable infusion of 20% dextrose (D20) will be used to maintain euglycemia (100 mg/dl target) according to pre calibrated algorithm. Samples for subsequent measurement of total insulin and c -
peptide by [CONTACT_296568] [ADDRESS_362153] ex periences hyperglycemia (BG > 150 mg/dl) for two hours after discontinuation of the 
glucose infusion irrespective of total duration of glucose infusion. At that point, the catheters will be removed and the subject will be discharged to home. In case of unusual circumstances including high requirements of glucose beyond 24 hours etc, we will assess for recent insulin dosing (< 15 hours as oppose to > 15 hours required per protocol), sulfonylurea screen etc. Carbohydrate free meals will be provided to the participant starting at noon and continued at traditional mealtimes thereafter for the duration of the glucose infusion. Non -caloric decaffeinated beverages will be available as needed. Subjects will be given their home dose of 
insulin prior to discharge.   
 
Two to four weeks later, the participant will return to complete the second half of the study in which they are given the dose of U500 they did not get at the time of their previous visit. Between visits, subjects will be 
instructed to go back on their usu al diabetes regimen. They will again be instructed to avoid exercise 48 hours 
before the study and provided with directions for how to manage their diabetes medications in the days 
immediately before the second visit. These will again be individualized bas ed on the participant’s current 
regimen with the intention to discontinue all medications so none are present at the start of the study. They will again report to the research center after dinner between 8 -10 pm and maintained on an insulin drip as 
necessary to maintain blood glucose between 100 -150 mg/dl. At [ADDRESS_362154] visit. A glucose infusion will again be given to maintain eyglycemia (100 mg/dl) and discontinued using t he same plan as for the first visit.  
 What is our study population?  
We will study adults with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. Criteria for participation are listed below.  
 
• Inclusion Criteria  
• Type 2 diabetes

Potential participants will be recruited from the Diabetes Clinics at the University of Minnesota. They will initially be ascertained for eligibility by [CONTACT_296569] t heir 
personal health care provider.  
 What are your treatment groups?  
Each individual will be studied twice, once after the administration of 100 units of U 500 and once after the administration of 200 units of U500. Dosage administration will be in random order.  
 What is our assignment strategy?  
The investigational pharmacy at the University of Minnesota will dispense the doses of U [ADDRESS_362155].  
 How many subjects per treatment group?  
We have powered the primary research question using [ADDRESS_362156] dose study but does not return for the second dose study will be replaced.  
 
With 15 subjects (N = 15) completing this cross over study design, we have 85% power using a paired t -
test to detect at least a 2 hour difference in the mean duration of action of the 100 vs 200 unit dose of U500 conservatively  assuming a within -person correlation of 0.30 (Figure 2). Power will be higher (the 
detectable difference will be smaller) if the within -person correlation is larger.  
 
What is the schedule of events?  
Please see figure 1. In random order subjects will be assigned to receive 100 or 200 units of U- 500 insulin on 
two separate occasions separated by a minimum of two weeks. Following U500 administration, euglycemia will be maintained by [CONTACT_296570].  
 • Concomitant medications  
 
Subjects will be continued on their non -diabetic medications. Medications used to treat diabetes will be 
discontinued before the study day. How medications will be discontinued will be individualized based on the participant’s current regimen with the intention to discontinue all medications so none are present at the start of 
the study. For example, individuals on metformin, sulfonylureas, DPP4Is, GLP -1 agonists will be instructed to not 
take this drug on the day th ey will be admitted to the research center.  
 
• Outcome measures  
 
Primary outcome measure: Duration (in hours) of 20 % dextrose infusion requirement.  
 
Secondary outcome measure: 1) Peak 20 % dextrose requirement. 2) Area under the curve (AUC) of  20 % 
dextrose.  
 • Safety measures  
 
Investigator related measures: Our research group has had extensive experience in subject recruitment of 
patients with diabetes in research studies including GRADE, ACCORD and REWIND. We have performed hundreds 
of precise clamp  studies including euglycemic, hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic. We have a dedicated staff and 
are well equipped to handle these experiments.  
 
Subject related measures: Subjects will be under constant supervision by [CONTACT_296571]. U -500 insulin will be handled by [CONTACT_138131] (IDS) 
pharmacy according to institutional policies regarding U- 500 regular insulin (attached document: U 500 Insulin 
Safety Plan, U 500 insulin formulary committee meeting). Pre specified dose of U 500 regular insulin will be 
calculated, drawn and verified in U- 100 insulin syringe at IDS pharmacy according to a conversion chart (attached 
document: U -500 regular insulin conversion chart). After the administration of insulin, the D20 infusion will be 
titrated by [CONTACT_296572]. Subject will remain in the research unit until the subject can 
maintain euglycemia without a glucose infusion for at least [ADDRESS_362157] experienc es 
hyperglycemia (BG > 150 mg/dl) for two hours after discontinuation of the glucose infusion.  
 
• Sample size computation and power analysis  
 We have powered the primary research question using [ADDRESS_362158] dose study but does not return for the second dose study will be replaced. With 15 subjects (N = 15) completing this cross over study design, we have 85% power using a paired t -test to 
detect at least a 2 hour difference  in the mean duration of action of the 100 vs 200 unit dose of U500 
conservatively assuming a within- person correlation of 0.30 (Figure 2).  
 • Statistical analysis plan  
 The duration (in hours) of 20 % dextrose infusion requirement, peak 20 % dextrose requirement , and the AUC of 20 % dextrose will be calculated for each subject after the administration of each of the [ADDRESS_362159].

U-500 Regular Insulin  
 
Situation:   
On occasion, a patient requiring very high doses of regular insulin will be prescribed U -500 
regular insulin.  
 
Background:   
Regular insulin comes in two concentrations U -100 (100 units/mL) and U -500 (500 units/mL). 
Historically, Fairview has elected to not use the U -[ADDRESS_362166] had a few patients that warranted the use of U -500 due to doses in excess of 
100 units..  
 
To prevent accidental selection of this medication in both FCIS and WORx, the U -500 insulin 
was not included in the programming. Because of this a miscellaneous medication entry is 
required into the electronic system. When this feature is used, no alerts and safety features 
are built into the prog ramming.  
 
Assessment:   
Because of the need to use this concentration on rare occasion, safety plans should be put into 
place to prevent errors.  
 
Recommendation:   
0. • Restrict prescribing of U -500 insulin to endocrinology   
0. • Require the medication be stored in a separate location in central pharmacy 
(Whenever possible in the C -II safe fridge)   
0. • Require all doses be drawn- to-dose (in an insulin syringe, with no overfill) in 
central pharmacy  
1. • Add an alert in WORx stating the above   
0. • On the insulin product page in FCIS, add this U -500 insulin to the non- formulary 
section with a note that it is restricted to endocrinology. If possible to create an MLM if U -
500 insulin is ordered and the dose is <100 units/dose prohibiting use of U -500.   
0. • Add teaching aid for nursing to FCIS in background

Contraindications   
0. • Humulin® R U-500 is contraindicated during epi[INVESTIGATOR_296553] R U -500 or any of its excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].   
Warnings   
0. • Starting or changing insulin therapy should be done cautiously and only under medical supervision.   
0. • Humulin R U -500 contains 500 units of insulin in each milliliter (5 times more concentrated than 
Humulin R U -100). For Humulin R U -500, extreme caution must be observed in the measurement of 
dosage because inadvertent overdose may result in serious adverse reaction or life -threatening 
hypoglycemia.   
0. • Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR -gamma Agonists:  
Thiazolidinediones  (TZDs), which are PPAR -gamma agonists, can cause dose- related fluid retention, 
particularly when used in combination with insulin, including Humulin R U -500. Fluid retention may lead to or 
exacerbate heart failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure and consider 
discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR -gamma agonist.   
Precautions   
• • Dosing Confusion/Dosing Errors : Medication errors associated with Humulin R U -[ADDRESS_362169] occurred  
and resulted in hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or death. The majority of errors occurred due to errors in 
dispensing, prescribing, or administration.   
• − The Humulin R U -500 vial, which contains 20 mL, versus the Humulin R U- 100 vial, which contains 
10 mL, is marked with a band of diagonal brown stripes to distinguish it from the U -100 vial, which has 
no stripes. “U -500” is also highlighted in red on the label.   
• − The prescribed dose of Humulin R U -500 should always be expressed in actual units of Humulin R 
U-500 along with corresponding markings on the syringe the patient is using (ie, a U -100 insulin syringe 
or volumetric [tuberculin or allergy] syringe).   
• − A majority of administration errors occurred due to dosing confusion when the Humulin R U -500 dose 
was prescribed in units or volume corresponding to a U -100 insulin syringe or volumetric syringe 
markings, respectively, or the prescribed dose was administered without recognizing that the markings on 
the syringe used do not directly correspond to U -500 dose. Instructions for use should always be read 
and followed before use.   
• − Instruct the patient to inform hospi[INVESTIGATOR_296554] R U -500 prescribed.   
• − A conversion chart should always be used when administering Humulin R U -500 doses with U -100 
insulin syringes or volumetric syringes.   
• • Hypoglycemia : Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulin therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including 
Humulin R U -500. Hypoglycemia may occur suddenly. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness, 
convulsions, temporary or permanent impairment of brain function, or death. As with all insulin preparations, the 
time course of Humulin R U -500 action may vary in different individuals   
or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, 
temperature, and physical activity.   
• − Adjustment of dosage of any insulin may be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or  
if patients change their physical activity or their usual meal plan, or during times of illness, emotional 
disturbances, or other stresses. Concomitant oral antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted; however concomitant use is not recommended.   
• − Any patient who requires Humulin R U -500 for control of diabetes should be under close observation 
until appropriate dosage is established. Insulin resistance may be transitory, and dosage requirements 
may change over time. Use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may 
be predisposed to hypoglycemia. The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a 
result of hypoglycemia. These abilities are especially important in driving or operating other machinery.

Important Safety Information for Humulin R U -500, continued  
 
Precautions, continued   
0. • Hyperglycemia, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, and Hyperosmolar Non -Ketotic Syndrome : 
Hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar coma may develop if the patient takes less 
Humulin  R U-500 than needed to control blood glucose levels. Severe sustained hyperglycemia may 
result in hyperosmolar coma or death.   
0. • Hypokalemia: Insulin use can lead to hypokalemia, that left untreated may cause respi[INVESTIGATOR_4939],  
ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (eg, patients 
using potassium -lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium 
concentrations).   
0. • Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions : Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, 
including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including Humulin R U -500. Localized reactions 
and generalized myalgias have been reported.   
0. • Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Frequent glucose monitoring and insulin dose reduction may be required.    
0. • Drug Interactions : Some medications may alter insulin requirements and the risk for hypoglycemia 
and hyperglycemia. Some medications may mask the signs of hypoglycemia in some patients. Therefore, 
insulin dose adjust ment and particularly close monitoring may be required.   
0. • Pregnancy Category B : There are no adequate and well- controlled clinical studies of the use of  
Humulin R U -500 in pregnant or nursing women or during labor and delivery.  
1. • Pediatric Use: There are no well- controlled studies of use of Humulin R U -500 in children.   
 
Adverse Reactions   
• • Hypoglycemia : Hypoglycemia is one of the most frequent adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_296573].    
• − Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain 
conditions, such as long duration of diabetes, autonomic diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such 
as beta- adrenergic blockers, changing insulin preparations, or intensified control (3 or more insulin 
injections per day) of diabetes.   
• − Hypoglycemia when using Humulin R U -500 can be prolonged and severe.   
• • Additional adverse reactions include hypokalemia, lipodystrophy, local and systemic 
allergy, weight gain, and  peripheral edema.   
Dosage and Administration   
0. • The injection of Humulin R U -500 should be followed by a meal within approximately 30 minutes 
of administration.   
0. • Humulin R U -500 should only be administered subcutaneously. Do not administer Humulin R U-500 
intravenously or intramuscularly.   
0. • Do not mix Humulin R U -500 with other insulins in the same syringe .

INFORMATION FOR  THE PHYSICIAN  
HUMULIN® R 
REGULAR  
U-500 (CONCENTRATED)  
INSULIN HUMAN INJECTION, USP  
(rDNA ORIGIN)   
DESCRIPTION   
Humulin R® U-500 is a polypeptide hormone structurally identical to human insulin synthesized through rDNA technology in a special non-disease- producing laboratory strain of Escherichia 
coli bacteria.   
Humulin R U -500 has the empi[INVESTIGATOR_62497] C 257H383N65O77S6 and a molecular weight of 5808.   
Humulin R U- 500 is a sterile, clear, aqueous and colorless solution that contains human insulin (rDNA origin) 500 units/mL, glycerin 16 mg/mL, metacresol 2.5 mg/mL and zinc oxide to supplement the 
endogenous zinc to obtain a total zinc content of 0.017 mg/100 units, and water for injection. The pH is 7.0 to 7.8. Sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid may be added during manufacture to adjust the pH.   
Humulin R U- 500 is for subcutaneous injection only. It should not be used intravenously or intramuscularly.   
Humulin R U -500 contains 500 units of insulin in each milliliter (5-times more concentrated than Humulin R U-100 [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]). It also contains 16 
mg glycerin, 2.5 mg metacresol as a preservative, and zinc -oxide calculated to supplement endogenous zinc to obtain a total zinc content of 0.017 mg/100 units and water for 
injection. Sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid may be added during manufacture to adjust the pH.   
Adequate insulin dosage permits patients with diabetes to effectively utilize carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Regardless of  dose strength, insulin enables carbohydrate metabolism to occur and thus to 
prevent the production of  ketone bodies by [CONTACT_4852]. Some patients might develop severe insulin resistance such that daily doses of several hundred units of insulin or more are required.  
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY   
Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulin. Insulin lowers blood glucose by [CONTACT_296574], and by 
[CONTACT_296575]. Insulins inhibit lipolysis, proteolysis, and gluconeogenesis, and enhance protein synthesis and conversion of ex cess glucose into fat.   
Administered insulin, including Humulin R U -500, substitutes for inadequate endogenous insulin secretion and partially corrects the disordered metabolism and inappropriate hyperglycemia of diabetes 
mellitus, which are caused by [CONTACT_5640] a deficiency or a reduction in the biologic effectiveness of insulin. When administered in appropriate doses at prescribed intervals to patients with diabetes mellitus, Humulin 
R U-[ADDRESS_362170] within 30 minutes, has a peak similar to that observed with U -100 regular human insulin and has a relatively long duration of activity following a single dose (up to 24 hours) as compared with U -[ADDRESS_362171] to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and children with type 1 and type 2  
diabetes mellitus.   
Humulin  R U- 500 is useful for the treatment of insulin -resistant patients with diabetes requiring daily doses of more than 200 units, since a large dose may be administered subcutaneously in a reasonable 
volume. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS   
Humulin R U- 500 is contraindicat ed during epi[INVESTIGATOR_296555] R U -500 or any of its 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].   
WARNINGS   
Any change of insulin should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer , type (e .g., regular, NPH, analog, 
etc.), species, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in dosage.   
Humulin R U -500 contains 500 units of insulin in each milliliter (5 -times more concentrated than Humulin R U -100). For Humulin  R U-500, extreme 
caution must be observed in the measurement of dosage because inadvertent overdose may result in serious adverse reaction or life-threatening 
hypoglycemia.   
Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR -gamma agonists: Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor (PPAR) -gamma agonists, can cause dose-
related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patien ts treated with insulin, including Humulin R U -500, and a PPAR -gamma 
agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR -
gamma agonist must be considered.  
 
PRECAUTIONS  
Dosing Confusion/Dosing Errors   
Medication errors associated with Humulin R U- [ADDRESS_362172] occurred and resulted in patients experiencing hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia or death. The majority of er rors 
occurred due to errors in dispensing, prescribing or administration. Attention to the following details may prevent:  
• Dispensing errors   
The Humulin R U -500 vial, which contains 20 mL, versus the Humulin R U- 100 vial, which contains 10 mL – is marked with a band of diagonal brown stripes to 
distinguish it from the U -100 vial, which has no stripes. “U -500” is also highlighted in red on the label.  
• Prescribing errors (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)   
The prescribed dose of Humulin R U -500 should always be expressed in actual units of Humulin R U -500 along with corresponding markings on the syringe the patient is using 
(i.e., a U-100 insulin syringe or tuberculin syringe [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]).  
• Administration errors (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)   
A majority of these errors occurred due to dosing confusion when the Humulin R U -500 dose was prescribed in units or volume corresponding to a U -100 syringe or tuberculin syringe markings, respecti vely, 
or the prescribed dose was administered without recognizing that the markings on the syringe used do not directly correspond to U -500 dose. Instructions for use should always be read and followed before use.   
HUMULIN® R REGULAR U- 500 (CONCENTRATED)  
INSULIN HUMAN INJECTION, USP (rDNA ORIGIN)  PA [ADDRESS_362173] common adverse reaction of all insulin therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including Humulin  R U-500. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or 
convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the  assistance of another person and/or parenteral 
glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with Humulin R U -500.  
As with all insulin preparations, the time course of Humulin R U -[ADDRESS_362174] patients will require 2 or 3 injections per day.   
Insulin resistance, in some patients is transitory; after several weeks or months during which high dosage is required, responsiveness to the 
pharmacologic effect of insulin may be regained and dosage can be reduced.   
The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time- action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., 
amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug 
Interactions).   
As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric 
population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may 
prevent a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery.   
Severe hypoglycemia may develop [ADDRESS_362175] glucose metabolism or insulin sensi tivity. Early signs of diabetic 
ketoacidosis include glycosuria and ketonuria. Polydipsia, polyuria, loss of appetite, fatigue, dry  skin, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and compensatory tachypnea come on gradually, usually over a period 
of some hours or days, in conjunction with hyperglycemia and ketonemia. Severe sustained hyperglycemia may result in hyperosmolar coma or death.  
 
Hypokalemia   
Insulin stimulates potassium movement into the cells, possibly leading to hypokalemia, that left untreated may cause respi[INVESTIGATOR_4939], ventricular arrhythmia, and death. 
Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium -lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium 
concentrations).   
Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions   
Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin p roducts, including Humulin R U -500 (see ADVERSE 
REACTIONS).   
Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of metacresol as an injectable excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].   
Renal or Hepatic Impairment   
Frequent glucose monitoring and insulin dose reduction may be required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.   
Drug Interactions   
Some medications may alter insulin requirements and the risk for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Drug Interactions).   
Use in Pregnancy   
Pregn ancy Category B — All pregnancies have background risk of birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. This background risk is increased in pregnancies 
complicated by [CONTACT_296576]. It is important for patients to maintain good control of diabetes before conception and during pregnancy. Special attention should be 
paid to diet, exercise and insulin regimens. Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester, usually increase during the second and third trimesters and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_296556]. Careful glucose 
monitoring is essential in these patients. Female patients should be advised to tell their physician if they intend to become, or if they become pregnant.  
 
Studies show that endogenous insulin only crosses the placenta in minimal amounts. While there are no adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women, an extensive body of published literature 
demonstrates the maternal and fetal benefits of insulin treatment in patients with diabetes during pregnancy. Humulin R U -500 is a recombinant human insulin that is identical to the endogenous hormone; 
therefore, reproduction and fertility studies were not performed in animals.  
Labor and Delivery   
Careful glucose monitoring and management of patients with diabetes during labor and delivery are required.   
Nursing Mothers   
Endogenous insulin is present in human milk. Insulin orally ingested is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. In lactating infants, no adverse reactions have been associated with maternal use of insulin. In a 
study of eight preterm infants between 26 to 30 weeks gestation, enteral administration of Humulin R did not result in hypoglycemia. Good glucose control supports lactation in patients with diabetes. Patients 
with diabetes who are lactating may require adjustments in insulin dose and/or diet.  
Pediatric Use  
There are no well -controlled studies of use of Humulin R U -500 in children.   
HUMULIN® R REGULAR U- 500 (CONCENTRATED)  
INSULIN HUMAN INJECTION, USP (rDNA ORIGIN)  PA [ADDRESS_362176] frequent adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_296573]. Symptoms of mild to moderate hypoglycemia may occur suddenly and can include:  
• sweating  • drowsiness  
• dizziness  • sleep disturbances  
• palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332]  • anxiety 
• tremor  • blurred vision  
• hunger  • slurred speech  
• restlessness  • depressed mood  
• tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue  • irritability  
• lightheadedness  • abnormal behavior  
• inability to concentrate  • unsteady movement  
• headache  • personality changes  
Signs of severe hypoglycemia can include:  
• disorientation  • seizures 
• unconsciousness  • coma 
• death   
Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced  under certain conditions, such as long duration of diabetes, autonomic 
diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta -adrenergic blockers, changing insulin preparations, or intensified control (3 or more insulin injections 
per day) of diabetes.   
Without recognition of early warning symptoms, the patient may not be able to take steps to avoid more serious hypoglycemia. Patients who experience 
hypoglycemia without early warning symptoms should monitor their blood glucose more frequently, especially prior to activities such as driving. Mild to moderate 
hypoglycemia may be treated by [CONTACT_296577]. Patients should always carry a quick source of sugar, such as hard candy, non -diet 
carbohydrate- containing drinks or gluc ose tablets.  
Hypoglycemia when using Humulin R U- 500 can be prolonged and severe.   
Hypokalemia  
See Precautions   
Lipodystrophy   
Administration of insulin subcutaneously can result in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or th ickening of 
tissue).   
Allergy  
Local Allergy — Patients occasionally experience erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. This condition usually is self -limiting. In some instances, this condition may be related to factors 
other than insulin, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique.   
Systemic Allergy — Less common, but potentially more serious, is generalized allergy to insulin, which may cause rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, r eduction in blood pressure, fast 
pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) may be life threatening.  
Weight gain   
Weight gain can occur with some insulin therapi[INVESTIGATOR_296557].   
Peripheral Edema   
Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by [CONTACT_296578].   
Drug Interactions   
The concurrent use of oral antihyperglycemic diabetes agents with Humulin R U- [ADDRESS_362177] of Humulin R U -500 and susceptibility to hypoglycemia:   
0. • Oral  antihyperglycemic  diabetes  agents, salicylates, sulfa  antibiotics, certain  antidepressants   
(monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), pramlintide, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, propox yphene, pentoxifylline, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor   blocking agents, beta- adrenergic blockers, inhibitors of pancreatic function (e.g., octreotide), and alcohol.  
Drugs that may reduce the blood- glucose- lowering effect:   
• Corticosteroids, isoniazid, certain lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., niacin), estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents, somatropin, 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709], glucagon, protease inhibitors and thyroid replacement therapy.  
Drugs that may increase or decrease blood- glucose- lowering effect:  
0. • Beta- adrenergic blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol.   
0. • Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by [CONTACT_157710].   
Drugs that may mask the signs of hypoglycemia:  
0. • Beta- adrenergic blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpi[INVESTIGATOR_050].   
OVERDOSAGE   
Excess insulin may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. Hypoglycemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin relative to food intake, energy expenditure, or both. Mild epi[INVESTIGATOR_296558]. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise, may be needed. More severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_296559], seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with 
intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. 
Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately.  
 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION   
Humulin R U -500 is usually given two or three times daily before meals. The dosage and time of Humulin R U -500 should be individualized  and determined, based 
on the physician’s advice, in accordance with the needs of the patient. The injection of Humulin R U -500 should be followed by a meal within approximately 30 
minutes of administration.   
The average range of total daily insulin requirement for maintenance therapy in insulin- treated patients without severe insulin resistance lies between 0.5 and 1.0 unit/kg/day. However, in pre- pubertal children 
it  
HUMULIN® R REGULAR U- 500 (CONCENTRATED)  
INSULIN HUMAN INJECTION, USP (rDNA ORIGIN)  PA 3055 AMP   
usually varies from 0.7 to 1.0 unit/kg/day, but can be much lower during the period of partial remission. In situations of insulin resistance, e.g., during puberty or due to obesity, the daily insulin requirement may 
be substantially higher. Init ial dosages for type 2 diabetes patients are often lower, e.g., 0.2 to 0.4 units/kg/day.   
Humulin R U -500 is useful for the treatment of insulin resistant patients with diabetes requiring daily doses of more than 200 units, sin ce a 
large dose may be administered subcutaneously in a reasonable volume.   
Humulin R U- 500 may be administered by [CONTACT_296579], the thigh, the gluteal region or in the upper arm. S ubcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster 
absorptio n than from other injection sites. Injection into a lifted skin fold minimizes the risk of intramuscular injection. Injection  sites should be rotated within the same region. As with all insulin, the duration of 
action will vary according to the dose, injec tion site, blood flow, temperature, and level of physical activity.   Humulin R U -500 should only be administered subcutaneously. Do not administer Humulin R U -500 intravenously or intramuscularly.   
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 
Never use Humulin R U -500 if it has become viscous (thickened) or cloudy; use it only if it is clear and colorless. Humulin R U -500 should not be used after the 
printed expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].   
Do not mix Humulin R U -500 with other insulins, as there are no data to support such use.   
When administering Humulin R U -500  
If U-100 insulin syringes are used, since their markings are in units and are designed and intended for use with the less concentrated U -100 insulin products, it is 
extremely important to explain the amount of Humulin R U -500 insulin to be administered in both actual dose and with specification of “unit markings” on the U -100 
syringe.  
If tuberculin syringes are used, since their markings are in volume (mL), the actual amount of Humulin R U -500 should be explained in both actual dose and with specification of volume (mL). Table 1 contains 
conversion information using both U -100 insulin and tuberculin syringes to help avoid dose confusion.

Read the Patient Information that comes with Humulin® R U-[ADDRESS_362178] important information I should know about Humulin R U -500?  
Humulin  R U- 500 (500 units/mL) contains [ADDRESS_362179] U -100 (100 units/mL) 
insulin. This means that it is more concentrated than standard U -100 insulin.   
Know your insulin. Make sure you know the strength, dose and type of insulin that is prescribed for you. Do not change the strength, 
dose or type of insulin you use unless told to do so by [CONTACT_296581].   
It is important that you take the right dose of Humulin R U -500. Taking too much Humulin R U -500 can cause life-
threate ning low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or death. Taking too little Humulin R U -500 can cause high blood sugar 
(hyperglycemia).   
There are no special syringes to measure Humulin R U -500. It is important that you use only the syringes that your healthcare provi der 
tells you to use. Your healthcare provider should tell you how much Humulin R U -[ADDRESS_362180] 
U-100 insulin which would be drawn up into the syringe. See the section, “How should I take Humulin R U -500?”  
What is Humulin R U -500?  
Humulin R U -500 is a prescription medicine used to treat high blood sugar in people with diabetes mellitus. Humulin R U -500 is a man- made 
insulin that is similar to the insulin produced by [CONTACT_296582]. Humulin R U -500 is used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar 
in people with:   
0. • type 1 diabetes.   
0. • type 2 diabetes whose blood sugars are not controlled well with diabetes medicine taken by [CONTACT_1966].   
Humulin R U -500 is useful for the treatment of insulin -resistant patients with diabetes who need more than 200 units of insulin a 
day.  
It is not known if Humulin R U -500 is safe and effective in children.   
Who should not take Humulin R U -500? Do not take Humulin R U -500 if:  
0. • your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycemia). See the section, “What are the possible side effects of Humulin R U -500?” for more information on low blood 
sugar.  
 
0.• you are allergic to any of the ingredients in Humulin R U -500. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in 
Humulin R U -500.   
What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking Humulin  R U-500? Before you take Humulin R U -500, tell your healthcare provider if 
you:  
0. • have liver or kidney problems or any other medical conditions. Certain medical conditions can affect your insulin needs and your dose of Humulin R U -
500.  
 
0. • take any other  medicines, especially ones commonly called TZDs (thiazolidinediones).  
 
0. • have heart failure or other heart problems. If you have heart failure, it may get worse while you take TZDs with 
Humulin R U -500.   
0. • are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast -feeding. It is not known if Humulin R U -[ADDRESS_362181] your blood sugar levels and your insulin needs. Your Humulin R U -500 dose may need to change if you take other medicines. Especially tell

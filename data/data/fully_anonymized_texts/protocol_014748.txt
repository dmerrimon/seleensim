I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
  
Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are a major cause of morbidity 
and mortality  for patients undergoing the estimated 51 million annual inpatient 
surgeries in the US1–3. National estimates suggest 1,062,[ADDRESS_1153460] 
a crucial role of  perioperative interventions such as ventilatory strategies7–10, and 
administration and reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents11,12 in reducing PPCs, 
consistent  with the beneficial effects of lung protective ventilation in the acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS)13. Surgical patients differ substantially from 
ARDS patients as most have no or limited lung injury at the onset of surgery. Yet, during 
and after abdominal surgery, systemic inflammation due to surgical trauma14 and 
translocation of endotoxin15 and bacteria16 predispose to indirect lung injury; while 
resorptive and compression atelectasis from limited diaphragmatic excursion, surgical 
retractors, muscle paralysis, high inspi[INVESTIGATOR_830885], prolonged supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], 
and pain17–[ADDRESS_1153461] of intraoperative constant high vs. low positive end-expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP) on 
PPCs. While the first trial highlighted the relevance of ventilatory strategies to 
postoperative outcomes, the second led to the controversial recommendation that low 
PEEP should be the standard of care in abdominal surgery23,[ADDRESS_1153462] a large prospective multicenter randomized controlled pragmatic 
trial with a blinded assessor to compare PPCs in patients undergoing major open 
abdominal surgery receiving an individualized management bundle versus  usual care. 
We hypothesize  that this anesthesia-centered bundle, based on our recent findings 
and focused on perioperative lung protection, will minimize multiple and synergistic 
factors responsible for the multiple-hit perioperative pulmonary dysfunction and result in 
decreased incidence and severity of PPCs .  
  
II. SPECIFIC AIMS  
We will leverage the experience achieved in a successful pi[INVESTIGATOR_830886]26 to study this hypothesis by [CONTACT_830970]:  
Specific Aim 1: To compare the number and severity of PPCs in patients 
receiving an individualized perioperative anesthesia-centered bundle to those in 
patients receiving usual anesthetic care during open abdominal surgery. The 
anesthesia-centered bundle will consist of: (a) mechanical ventilation utilizing 
individualized PEEP with recruitment maneuvers to maximize respi[INVESTIGATOR_830887]; (b) individualized use of neuromuscular 
blocking agents and their reversal; and (c) postoperative lung expansion to maintain 
lung recruitment following surgery. We will use the patient classification of PPC severity 
during the first [ADDRESS_1153463] of our intervention not only on PPC incidence but also on severity 
distribution.  
Specific Aim 2:  To assess the effect of the proposed bundle on plasma levels 
of lung injury biomarkers. We hypothesize that our intervention will minimize lung 
mechanical injury and systemic inflammation by [CONTACT_830971]. 
Thus, we anticipate that plasma levels of biomarkers of inflammation, epi[INVESTIGATOR_018], and 
endothelial cell injury will be lower in the intervention arm as previously described with 
lung protective ventilation for ARDS27,28, and in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]29 and others30 data for PPCs.  
The mechanistic insights from this aim will facilitate bundle dissemination and support 
adoption as it has for lung protective ventilation for ARDS.28,31,32, In the process, we will 
create a novel biobank uniquely focused on PPCs, and gain mechanistic insights on 
early perioperative lung protection.   
  
At the end of this project, we expect that this novel and clinically feasible anesthesia-
centered bundle will change clinical practice and reduce pulmonary morbidity in the 
large population of patients undergoing open abdominal surgery.

IV. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Identification, screening and consent: Participant identification and screening will be 
done in all sites from pre-admission/anesthesia clinic schedules (manua l or electronic), 
surgeons9 office schedules, operating room schedules and by [CONTACT_830974]. Patient advocacy groups are not currently engaged 
because this study does not focus on a patient population with a known disease. 
Instead, our study population is defined by [CONTACT_830975]-defined risk level for 
postoperative pulmonary complications that are scheduled to undergo abdominal 
surgery. Thus, the anesthesiologists and surgeons performing these procedures and 
their offices9 personnel are the clinical communities critical for successful recruitment 
and retention for this study. We have shown successful recruitment in similar patients 
for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] R34 study, with no objection by [CONTACT_830976]9 clinical care in having any patient enrolled in the study.  
  
Once subjects are identified as meeting inclusion criteria, they will be contact[CONTACT_830977]9s procedures including approaches such as in person during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830889] a site-specific approved 
HIPAAcompliant telemedicine videoconferencing platform. Besides regular signature [CONTACT_831086], we will also offer the option for electronic consent signature 
(eConsent).   
  
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH):  Once subjects are identified as meeting 
inclusion criteria, the study will be first introduced to them  by a member of the treatment 
team known to the subject. Such introduction will be done through one of the following 
manners: in person, teleconference, phone, IRB approved letter, secure email, 
reproducing the IRB approved letter, distributed flier, or Patient Gateway.  
Provided patients express agreement to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], they will be further approached 
through one of the following methods: (i) in person during a clinic visit, (ii) by [CONTACT_830978], or (iii) by [CONTACT_89205] (a likely case at the MGH as 
several patients are referred from and assessed in other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830890]). Direct contact 
[CONTACT_830979] (RODY) program  question. If contact [CONTACT_830980] a clinic 
visit, consent will be directly obtained after all questions and concerns are addressed 
 
[ADDRESS_1153465] then agrees to participate, consent will be obtained in person on 
the day of their surgery or through eConsent utilizing the MGH approved system.  
Pregnant women and children are not being enrolled in this study. No class of subjects, 
including institutionalized individuals, minorities, or other potentially vulnerable 
populations, will be excluded or preferentially targeted. Documentation of reasons for 
ineligibility and for non-participation of eligible candidates will be performed with a 
screening log.   
The subset of patients only physically present in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830891] a practical issue as per protocol the 
anesthesia team caring for the patient is assigned according to the group the patient is 
randomized to and the assignment of anesthesiologists to cases is done in the day 
before surgery. To address this, patients in that subset expressing preliminary 
agreement with their participation and not able to sign an eConsent will be 
prerandomized. If assigned to the intervention group, their anesthesia team will be 
assigned accordingly. They will also receive by [CONTACT_830981]9s brochure and a link to 
a YouTube explanatory video (provided below). Such material provides brief information 
on postoperative pulmonary complications and methods to reduce them. Consequently, 
it will increase patients9 education on their perioperative care. In fact, similar types of 
materials are commonly used in other institutions for routine clinical care.  
Randomization will be confirmed, and patients considered enrolled in the study only 
when they ultimately sign the informed consent before surgery.  
Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH):  Participant identification and screening will 
be done at BWH from pre-admission/anesthesia clinic schedules (manual or electronic), 
surgeons9 office schedules, operating room schedules and by [CONTACT_830974]. Patient advocacy groups are not currently engaged 
because this study does not focus on a patient population with a known disease. 
Instead, our study population is defined by [CONTACT_830975]-defined risk level for 
postoperative pulmonary complications that are scheduled to undergo abdominal 
surgery. Thus, the anesthesiologists and surgeons performing these procedures and 
their offices9 personnel are the clinical communities critical for successful recruitment 
and retention for this study. We have shown successful recruitment for our past 
interventional trials, with no objection by [CONTACT_830976]9 clinical care in having any patient enrolled in the study.

  Once subjects are identified as meeting our inclusion criteria, th ey will be contact[CONTACT_830982][INVESTIGATOR_830892] (preferably in the 
preoperative anesthesia test center (PATC) at BWH. Pregnant women and children are 
not being enrolled in this study. No class of subjects, including institutionalized 
individuals, minorities, or other potentially vulnerable populations, will be excluded or 
preferentially targeted. Signed informed consent for participating in the study will be 
obtained prior to randomization and performance of any study procedures either 
inperson or through eConsent utilizing the BWH approved system. Documentation of 
reasons for ineligibility and for non-participation of eligible candidates will be performed 
with a screening log.   
Individuals responsible for screening, and approaching potential participants will be 
members of the research team: attending physicians, certified or in-training 
anesthesiologists, and research nurses, coordinators and assistants. All will have 
appropriate human subjects research training per institutional requirements (e.g., CITI 
training or equivalent). The sites9 research coordinators and assistants are experienced 
in screening and approaching participants and will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_830983]-PI ([CONTACT_831090]).   
University of Colorado:  Participant identification and screening will be done at 
University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830893]-admission/anesthesia clinic schedules (manual 
or electronic), surgeons9 office schedules, operating room schedules and by 
[CONTACT_830984]. Patient advocacy groups are 
not currently engaged because this study does not focus on a patient population with a 
known disease. Instead, our study population is defined by [CONTACT_830975]-defined risk

successful recruitment and retention for this study. We have shown successful 
recruitment for our past interventional trials, with no objection by [CONTACT_830985]9 clinical care in having any patient enrolled in the 
study.  
Once subjects are identified as meeting our inclusion criteria, they will be contact[CONTACT_830982][INVESTIGATOR_830892] (preferably in the 
preoperative center at University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). Pregnant women and children 
are not being enrolled in this study. No class of subjects, including institutionalized 
individuals, minorities, or other potentially vulnerable populations, will be excluded or 
preferentially targeted. Signed informed consent for participating in the study will be 
obtained prior to randomization and performance of any study procedures either 
inperson or through eConsent utilizing the University of Colorado approved system. 
Documentation of reasons for ineligibility and for non-participation of eligible candidates 
will be performed with a screening log.   
Individuals responsible for screening, and approaching potential participants will be 
members of the research team: attending physicians, certified or in-training 
anesthesiologists, and research nurses, coordinators and assistants. All will have 
appropriate human subjects research training per institutional requirements (e.g., CITI 
 
7  
  training or equivalent). The sites9 research coordinators and assista nts are experienced 
in screening and approaching participants and will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_830986]-PI ([CONTACT_70920]-Bustamante).   
  
  
Duke University Health System:   After obtaining permission from the operating 
surgeon, surgical subjects will be screened for eligibility by [CONTACT_830987]. If the patient meets eligibility criteria, the study team 
member will first check the Duke office of Clinical Research (DOCR) Opt Out list, to 
ensure that the patient has not opted out of research.  If it is shown that the patient has 
not opted out of research, then they will be contact[CONTACT_830988] a clinic visit or videoconference visit.   An IRB approved phone script will 
be used during phone communication. If the subject is in agreement, the coordinator will 
present the research protocol in its entirety to the prospective participant and will 
answer any and all questions as they arise. If the patient decides during the phone call 
that they would like to opt out of research, the study team member will direct the patient 
to contact [CONTACT_830989] [PHONE_17314].  If the 
patient agrees to participate, the coordinator will ask the subject to sign and date the 
appropriate consent form at their first visit if being contact[CONTACT_830990]. A copy of this consent form will be given to the subject and a copy of 
the consent form will be added to the patient9s medical record.   
  
Northwestern University/ Northwestern Medicine (NM):  Subjects will be identified by 
[CONTACT_830991] a preoperative visit or during their visit to the NM 
preoperative clinic or videoconference visit. If they have been identified as meeting the 
inclusion criteria they will be contact[CONTACT_830992]. For subjects contact[CONTACT_5143], study team 
members will use a prepared script to introduce the study including study parameters as 
well as the consent document and the requirements to participate. If the subject 
requests the consent document it will then be e-Mailed via Northwestern Encrypted 
eMail for their perusal or through eConsent utilizing the Northwestern University 
approved system. This will allow additional time for the subject to consult with family 
and personal physicians. A study team member will conduct a follow up telephone call 
to address whether the subject has additional questions regarding the study. The study 
team member will inquire whether the subject would like to participate in the study. On 
the day of surgery the study team member will meet with the subject in the preoperative 
area and will review the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The research study team 
member will also inquire whether the subject has any additional questions regarding the 
study. The study team members will provide ample time to answer any questions posed 
during the questioning. After this review the research study team will obtain written 
informed consent.  Pregnant women and children are not being enrolled in this study. 
No class of subjects, including institutionalized individuals, minorities, or other 
potentially vulnerable populations, will be excluded or preferentially targeted.

Participant identification and screening will be done at URMC from 
preadmission/anesthesia clinic schedules (manual or electronic), surgeons9 office 
schedules, and by [CONTACT_830984].  
Once subjects are identified as meeting inclusion criteria, they will be contact[CONTACT_831004]-operative visit (preferably in the Center for Perioperative 
Medicine (CPM) or at the surgical clinic visit either in-person or through  
videoconference. Pregnant women and children are not being enrolled in this study. No 
class of subjects, including institutionalized individuals, minorities, or other potentially 
vulnerable populations, will be excluded or preferentially targeted.  Signed informed 
consent for participating in the study will be obtained prior to randomization and 
performance of any study procedures. A URMC approved eConsent platform can be 
used.   
The potential subject will determine whether they prefer to review the consent in person 
or prefer the option of an eConsent at a later time.    
If potential subject prefers to use eConsent, the study team will request verbal 
permission to send the link to the URMC REDCap eConsent via email or text. The 
request will state: <Because URMC can9t control the security of email or text messages 
once we send them, we need your permission to text or email you. Do you want to 
receive the link to the eConsent via text or email?= The permission will be documented. 
The email/text will not include PHI and only includes a link to the URMC REDCap 
 
[ADDRESS_1153467] will receive an email/text 
with a link to the REDCap eConsent and a verbal passcode the user enters on the 
website to initiate and sign the eConsent at home on their computer, phone or electronic 
device.    
The subject will use the link to access the Redcap eConsent system. Once the subject 
completes 2-step verification entering the passcode on the RedCap website, they can 
then initiate the eConsent process. The study team will coordinate a time to review the 
eConsent with subject electronically over the phone and answer any questions the 
subject may have. The subject will then answer comprehension questions to be certain 
the subject understands the clinical study. (If there is any discrepancy in these answers 
the research staff will be notified and they will contact [CONTACT_831005].)  
Once comprehension questions are answered correctly, the subject can sign the 
eConsent to acknowledge that they have read and are interested in participating in this 
clinical study.  Subject9s signature [CONTACT_831087]. Once the consent form is signed and submitted, subjects will be able to 
receive a print out of the paper copy, download a pdf, and/or receive an email with a 
PDF attachment of the signed consent form.  
Documentation of reasons for ineligibility and for non-participation of eligible candidates 
will be performed with a screening log.   
Individuals responsible for screening, and approaching potential participants will be

eligibility and exclusion criteria do not discriminate either explicitly or implicitly against 
gender, race or ethnicity.  Pregnant women and children f18 will not be enrolled onto 
the study. 
Once subjects are identified as meeting the inclusion criteria, they will be approached 
during their Pre-Surgical Testing visit at MSKCC by a member of the research team. 
Details pertinent to the trial, expected outcomes, potential risks and adverse outcomes 
will be discussed in detail before enrollment. During the initial conversation between the 
investigator/research staff and the patients, the patient may be asked to provide certain 
health information that is necessary to the recruitment and enrollment process. They will 
use the information provided by [CONTACT_5363]/or medical record to confirm that the 
patient is eligible. 
Signed informed consent for participating in the study will be obtained prior to 
randomization and performance of any study procedures and documented in the 
patient9s chart.  Documentation of reasons for ineligibility and for non -participation of 
eligible candidates will be performed in a screening log and a note to file that will be

members of the research team: attending physicians, certified or in-training 
anesthesiologists, and surgeon, research nurses, coordinators and/or assistants. All will 
have appropriate human subjects research training per institutional requirements (e.g., 
CITI training or equivalent).  
Columbia University Irving Medical Center:  Participant identification and screening 
will be done at Columbia University Irving Medical Center from pre-
admission/anesthesia clinic schedules, surgeons9 office schedules, operating room 
schedules and by [CONTACT_830984]. Patient 
advocacy groups are not currently engaged because this study does not focus on a 
patient population with a known disease. Instead, our study population is defined by 
[CONTACT_830975]-defined risk level for postoperative pulmonary complications that are 
scheduled to undergo abdominal surgery. Thus, the anesthesiologists and surgeons 
performing these procedures and their offices9 personnel are the clinical communities 
critical for successful recruitment and retention for this study. We have shown 
successful recruitment for our past interventional trials, with no objection by [CONTACT_831010]9 clinical care in having any patient enrolled in 
the study. 
Once subjects are identified as meeting our inclusion criteria, they will be contact[CONTACT_831011] (POE) appointment at Columbia University Irving 
Medical Center. Pregnant women and children are not being enrolled in this study. No

  class of subjects, including institutionalized individuals, minori ties, or other potentially 
vulnerable populations, will be excluded or preferentially targeted. Signed informed 
consent for participating in the study will be obtained prior to randomization and 
performance of any study procedures. Documentation of reasons for ineligibility and for 
non-participation of eligible candidates will be performed with a screening log.  
Individuals responsible for screening and approaching potential participants will be 
members of the research team: attending physicians, certified or in-training 
anesthesiologists, and research nurses, coordinators and assistants. All will have 
appropriate human subjects research training per institutional requirements (e.g., CITI 
training or equivalent). The sites9 research coordinators are experienced in screening 
and approaching participants and will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_831012], and the site PI, [CONTACT_84469]. 
 
Cleveland Clinic Foundation:  Subjects will be identified using EMR system EPIC, 
searching in the pre-OP visit schedule. Only patients that meet the inclusion criteria will 
be approached in person during the pre-OP visit. Surgeons' agreement was obtained to 
contact [CONTACT_75054]. After presentation of the study protocol to the patient and all 
questions and concerns are addressed and answered consent will be directly obtained 
from those patients that agree to participate. All subjects will be given the opportunity to 
speak with a doctor during the consent process. In the case the patients decide to 
review the protocol and/or consent form at home or consult with their family or personal 
doctors, the patients will contact [CONTACT_779]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_830895]/she will be 
approached again on day of the surgery to inquire their willingness to participate.  If the 
subject then agrees to participate, consent will be obtained in person either during the 
pre-OP visit or the day of their surgery. Pregnant women and children are not being 
enrolled in this study. No class of subjects, including institutionalized individuals, 
minorities, or other potentially vulnerable populations, will be excluded or preferentially 
targeted. Documentation of reasons for ineligibility and for non-participation of eligible 
candidates will be performed with a screening log.  
Study coordinators, Research fellows and research assistants will be responsible for 
screening, and approaching potential participants. All will have appropriate human 
subjects research training per institutional requirements (e.g., CITI training or 
equiva lent). The sites9 research coordinator and assistants are experienced in screening 
and approaching participants and will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_831013]-PI ([CONTACT_831093] de Abreu). 
University of Nebraska Medical Center: Subject identification and screening will be 
completed at Nebraska Medicine using surgeons9 clinic schedules, pre -anesthesia clinic 
schedules, operating room schedules and by [CONTACT_831014].  Once subjects are screened and identified as meeting inclusion criteria, the 
research team will introduce the study by [CONTACT_54465]: in person, 
teleconference, phone, or OneChart patient portal.   
 
14  
  Should the potential research candidate express agreement to be  contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], they will 
be approached by [CONTACT_5051] (all of whom are trained per institutional 
requirements and have CITI training or equivalent) via the following means: in person 
during a clinic visit, by [CONTACT_831015], or by [CONTACT_89205].  If 
contact [CONTACT_831016], the potential subject will be allowed time 
to consult with their family or seek medical consultation.  Consent will be obtained only 
after allowed ample time to develop an informed decision.  If contact [CONTACT_831017] a 
videoconference or by [CONTACT_648], the research study team will then ask permission to send 
the potential subject the consent form via email or mail for their review.  A follow up call 
will then be made to address questions and concerns, and the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_830896], either in person or via 
videoconference/phone.  If the potential subject is agreeable to participation, consent 
will be obtained in person prior to surgery, as eConsent cannot be utilized in the state of 
Nebraska for this study. No vulnerable populations, including but not limited to 
minorities, will be preferentially excluded or targeted.  Documentation of potential 
candidate ineligibility or non-participation of eligible candidates will be performed with a 
screening log kept on a secure server. 
There exists a logistical concern for those patients who remotely pre-consent and are 
only available to be physically present in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8557]. There also 
exists the issue of Anesthesia staff at UNMC not being assigned to cases until the day 
prior to surgery.  In these instances, it will be properly documented and written into the 
IRB application to allow for study staff to pre-randomize the subject prior to obtaining 
written consent on day of surgery so that randomized anesthesia staff can be properly 
assigned to the subject9s case and if subject might randomize to the intervention arm, 
the subject would be able to receive educational materials pertaining to the clinical trial 
prior to the date of surgery.  Subject will specifically receive the study brochure and a 
link to a YouTube explanatory video via email.  The verbal consent would be properly 
documented per IRB requirements and endorsed by a witness.  Although randomization 
may occur prior to a wet signature [CONTACT_831088], the subject 
will only be considered enrolled in the study once the informed consent is ultimately 
signed with a wet signature [INVESTIGATOR_776088].   
 
Most of the research teams involved in this study have successfully implemented 
previous clinical studies within and outside our network3,10,33 –37.   
 
Recruitment sites and Recruitment rate: We currently have 17 sites for enrollment. To 
achieve our goal of 750 studied patients within the period  of approximately 36 months, 
an average of 1.5 patients recruited/site/month are required. We have agreed on a 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_830897]/month per participating center 
as recommended by [CONTACT_4318].   
  
Randomization: Two types of randomization are planned in the study: (1) randomization 
of individual patients and (2) randomization of attending ane sthesiologists to give either 
the intervention bundle or usual care. Randomization will use a centralized web-based 
system in the Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC), with stratification by [CONTACT_3725].  
 
[ADDRESS_1153469] of an 
individualized perioperative anesthesia-centered bundle on  
the number and severity of postoperative pulmonary  
complications (PPCs). Eligible patients will be adults   
undergoing major open abdominal surgery with intermediate 
or high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_830898]. These represent a large 
population of abdominal surgery patients sustaining the 
relevance and generalizability of the study. We plan to study 
a total of 750 adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery 
with general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation.  
 
Patients will receive the intervention perioperatively and will be followed by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_97893] (in-person or videoconference) and a daily phone call until discharged home or 
until 7 days after surgery. Phone calls or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042] (in-person or videoconference) 
will also be done immediately after postoperative days 7, 30 and 90 to determine 
additional complications. 
 
 
Strategy and Experimental Design : We hypothesize that an anesthesia-centered 
bundle, focused on perioperative lung expansion, will minimize the synergistic factors 
responsible for the multiple-hit perioperative pulmonary dysfunction and injury, and will 
result in decreased incidence and severity of PPCs.   
   
We will recruit adult patients with moderate or high risk for PPCs scheduled for major 
open abdominal surgery during 36 months and randomize them 1:[ADDRESS_1153470] of pre-, intra- 
and postoperative interventions aimed at optimizing perioperative lung expansion.

  The bundle is summarized in the mnemonic PRIME -AIR: PEEP (positive end-expi[INVESTIGATOR_22325]), Recruitment, Incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], Muscle relaxant optimization, preoperative 
Education, postoperative early Ambulation, Individualized, and Reinforced.  Specifically, 
the intervention bundle consists of: (1) individualized PEEP with recruitment maneuvers 
to maximize respi[INVESTIGATOR_830899]; (2) 
protocolized neuromuscular blockade agents administration and reversal based on 
neuromuscular monitoring; (3) postoperative lung expansion interventions (incentive 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_830900]) with adherence enhanced by [CONTACT_831018]. This 
is summarized in Fig. 1.  
  
Overview of Patient Flow in the Trial   
(Fig. 2): Trial activities for each 
participant will commence with 
enrollment. This will involve personal or 
phone contact [CONTACT_4007] a member of the study 
team with patients before surgery. After 
signing informed consent (or, for 
participants recruited by [CONTACT_831019], after 
agreeing to participate; please, see 
section IV. Subject Enrollment - MGH), 
patients will be randomized to receive 
the intervention (intervention group) or 
usual perioperative care (control group) 
using a web-based system in the 
SDCC.  The most intense interventional 
phase will occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830901]. Participants will 
receive three daily follow-up visits (in 
person or videoconference) by [CONTACT_831020] 7 days after surgery 
(whichever is longer). Recognizing that 
three visits per day may be difficult for 
specific participants and clinical 
situations, we will consider at least 2 
visits per day as adequate for the 
purposes of the study. Besides the visits by [CONTACT_514510],  a daily phone 
call, videoconference, or in-person visit will be done by a blinded investigator until 
discharge or 8 days after surgery. This period will allow for primary and secondary 
outcomes assessment.  
Outcomes will be collected through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], videoconference or phone calls (if the 
patient is discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) immediately after postoperative days (POD) 7, 30

  and 90. The visit (in-person or videoconference) or phone call f or POD7 (with medical 
record review if required) will provide primary and secondary outcomes, and the follow-
ups after POD 30 and 90 will correspond to secondary outcomes. Participation will be 
concluded after the POD 90 follow-up visit (in-person or videoconference) or phone call. 
Windows will be allowed for each postoperative assessment: postoperative days 7 to 14 
for the assessment of POD 7, postoperative days 30 to 45 for POD 30, and 
postoperative days 90 to 120 for POD 90.

patients in the Intervention group will receive study-specific preoperative education 
consisting of:  
  
  
A. Educational printed material and video: These materials will be provided to 
patients before their surgery. The materials will contain written  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_830903]. 
The effects of anesthesia and surgery on lung volumes and its consequences for lung 
dysfunction and infection will be explained. The educational materials have been 
designed to encourage patients to adhere to interventions by [CONTACT_831021]. The written information is included in 
Appendix II and the educational video is available at https://youtu.be/ZcNRZSqjgRw.  
  
B. 
In-person or videoconference education: Reinforcement of these concepts, 
answers to questions and practice with an incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830904]/surgery preoperative clinic, as videoconference, or on the day 
of surgery before transport to the operating room and administration of any sedatives. 
Members of the research team will implement this education intervention to maximize 
patient adherence. Family members and caregivers, if present, will be involved in the 
instruction to enhance involvement and further encourage adherence to therapy.   
 
 
Intraoperative Phase:  
  
 
[ADDRESS_1153471] of two components (Fig. 1):  
  
A. PEEP and Lung Recruitment - Mechanical Ventilation with Individualized PEEP:   
  
Perio
perative lung expansion will be accomplished by [CONTACT_831022]9s respi[INVESTIGATOR_77157] (C RS). This corresponds to 
the minimization of driving pressures, i.e., the difference between plateau pressure and 
PEEP during mechanical ventilation. This maximal compliance strategy will be started 
immediately after induction and repeated at least hourly throughout the surgery (see 
Appendix III for additional details) .  
   
PEEP individualization will be determined by a recruitment maneuver followed by a 
decremental PEEP titration (Fig. 3). The stepwise recruitment maneuver  will consist of 
the increase of PEEP from 5 to 20 cmH 2O in 5 cmH 2O steps of 30-sec each, as long as 
the patient9s plateau pressure (P plat) 
=30-32 cmH 2O (PEEP can be 
increased by 2-3 cmH 2O instead of 
by 5 cmH 2O to achieve P plat =30-32 
cmH 2O). Starting at this maximally 
achieved PEEP, PEEP will be 
decreased in 3 cmH 2O steps of 45-
75 sec until a maximum C RS is 
identified by a reduction in C RS at a 
lower PEEP following a larger C RS 
at a higher PEEP (Fig. 3). The 
minimum PEEP along the 
decremental steps will be [ADDRESS_1153472] PEEP level 
achieved during the recruitment 
maneuver will be used for 30-sec 
(in order to reinforce lung 
recruitment), followed by [CONTACT_831023]. The procedure will be repeated 
on an hourly basis, and  
following any significant event producing a g15% reduction in C RS (e.g., significant 
change in surgical table position, application of surgical retractors, endotracheal tube 
disconnection, endotracheal tube suction). Similar adjustments will be performed in   
Fig. 3. Decremental PEEP titration protocol

llowing a stepwise recruitment maneuver. 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_77157] (C RS) is measured 
at each step  
(●) and the PEEP corresponding to the maximum  
compliance is set as the individualized PEEP. In 
this example, titration would be stopped at 8 
cmH 2O and the final PEEP set at 11 cmH 2O.

  case of 
 15% C RS increases (i.e. removal of retractors) in order to avoid overinflation if 
t
riggers of lung derecruitment are removed.  
  
Other mechanical ventilation settings will be: volume controlled ventilation, tidal volume  
(VT)=6-8mL/kg of predicted body weight, F IO2 titrated for the target SpO 2g96% (F IO2 
increased only to maintain that target while avoiding hyperoxia), I:E ratio 1:2 and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_830905] (P ETCO 2=32-42 mmHg and/or P aCO 2=35-45 
mmHg, if available).   
  
  
B. Muscle relaxant optimization – Individualized 
Administration and Reversal of Neuromuscular 
Blocking Agents:   
  
Onl
y intermediate-acting neuromuscular  
blocking agents will be used (Table 2). Induction 
doses of muscle relaxants will be routine: 
Cisatracurium ( f0.2 mg/kg), rocuronium ( f1.2 
mg/kg), vecuronium ( f0.1 mg/kg).  Given the 
difficulty of precise dosing due to 
the presentation of the medications, 
doses 25% higher (or to the next 
round mL, e.g., 10 mg for 
rocuronium, 2 mg for cisatracurium, 
1 mg for vecuronium with usual 
presentations) will be considered as 
consistent with the intent of the 
protocol. Succinylcholine can be 
used and dosed at the anethesia 
team9s discretion . Mai ntenance 
doses will be administered as 
requ
ired by [CONTACT_831024]- 
of-four (TOF) stimulation. 
Readministration of muscle relaxants will be avoided as possible when <2 twitches are 
present unless specific clinical conditions such as diaphragmatic contraction indicate 
otherwise. Maintenance doses will be limited to (Table 2): Cisatracurium ( f0.03 mg/kg), 
rocuronium ( f0.2  mg/kg) and vecuronium ( f0.015 mg/kg). As described for the induction 
dose, we will consider doses f25%  higher than the target dose or to the next round 
dose in mililiters as consistent with the intent of the protoco l.

  (series of four electric stimuli delivered at 2 Hz). Ulnar nerve stimul ation with 
assessment of adductor pollicis response will be preferred. If not achievable, stimulation 
of the temporal branch of the facial nerve with orbicularis oculi response will be 
monitored38. We will encourage use of acceleromyography-guided quantitative TOF 
monitoring. Yet, given current practice, we designed this intervention to allow for use of 
either qualitative (based on visual or tactile assessment of the TOF response) or 
quantitative neuromuscular blockade monitoring. The following principles will be 
followed for neuromuscular blockade reversal management according to type of 
monitoring:   
  
B.1. Quantitative monitor (e.g., acceleromyography): In this case, at least 90% recovery 
of the ratio between the fourth and first twitches (T4/T1>0.9) of the TOF stimulation will 
be ensured before extubation. If this is present before administration of reversal agents, 
no neuromuscular blockade reversal is required. However, up to 1 mg/kg of 
sugammadex is allowed. If it is not present (i.e., T4/T1f0.9), reversal agents will be 
administered based on the TOF quantitative response according t o Table 3. As for the 
doses of neuromuscular blockers, we consider doses not more t han 25% above the target dose, 
or the next higher dosing interval (50 mg for total dose of sugammadex; 1 mg for total dose of 
neostigmine) as consistent with the protocol. Extub ation will only be performed once a 
T4/T1>0.9 is achieved.   
  
B.2
. Qualitative monitor (visual or tactile assessment of the TOF response): (i)  
Neostigmine users: administered only when at least two twitches are present in the TOF 
stimulation and based on the doses presented in Table 3; (ii) Sugammadex users: dose 
based on TOF count as recommended following rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced 
neuromuscular blockade (Table 3). As d escribed above for quantitative monitoring, higher 
doses will be considered consistent with the intent of the protocol if not more than 25% above 
the recommended dose or the total dose is not more than  the next highest dosing interval.  
 
Hig
h-dose neostigmine (g60 mcg/kg) will be systematically avoided since it can increase 
the risk for muscle weakness and postoperative complications12,39.  
 
Additional signs of patient responsiveness, such as ability to follow commands, and 
appropriate hemodynamic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_830906].  
  
Postoperative Phase:  
  
A. 
Incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]: Our protocol has been designed to address concerns that 
incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830907]32, 5. To maximize adherence and benefit, intervention patients will receive:(1) 
specific preoperative education as described above, (2) clear expectations of [ADDRESS_1153473] 10 hours along the day (i.e., 10 
sessions total with 100 incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830908]); and (3) direct supervision 
of performance targeted to [ADDRESS_1153474]
ructions will be based on the Guidelines of the American Association for Respi[INVESTIGATOR_189739]  (AARC)40. The patient will be instructed to hold the spi[INVESTIGATOR_830909], exhale normally, and then place the lips tightly around the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. This 
will be followed by a slow inhalation to raise the ball (flow-oriented) or the pi[INVESTIGATOR_55274]/plate 
(volume-oriented) in the chamber to the set target. At maximum inhalation, the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_830910], followed by [CONTACT_418226] 5-sec breath-hold and normal 
exhalation. Instruction of relatives, guardians, and other health caregivers in the 
technique will be provided to facilitate the patient9s appropriate use of the technique and 
assist with encouraging adherence to therapy.  
  
A member of the research team will be the supervisor aiming to maximize patient9s 
performance through education, reinforcement of expectations, and resolution of 
compliance barriers. Supervision will be started within [ADDRESS_1153475] 6 
hours/day and walk at least 75 meters 3 times/day41,42. Postoperative supervision visits 
can also be performed by [CONTACT_2329] a site-specific HIPAA-compliant telehealth 
videoconferencing platform.   
  
Preliminary studies from our group and previous investigations with targeted 
motivational education have shown improved adherence to therapy in respi[INVESTIGATOR_830911]43,44.    
                                                   
B. Postoperative Ambulation:   
 
As wi
th incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], early ambulation is routinely pursued after surgery but not 
always systematically implemented or reported (although it is more frequently 
systematically used than incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830912]). Early 
mobilization and ambulation of intervention patients will be done by [CONTACT_831025]9s routine care. The same member of the research 
team supervising incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830913], reinforcement, systematic monitoring (3x/day), and facilitation of barriers 
(e.g., pain) by [CONTACT_831026]. Ambulation after surgery is part of usual care in more than 50% of the 
planned sites (Table 4) and we will encourage early ambulation depending on 
resources routinely available at each individual site (e.g. nursing, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]). 
As tolerated, the following specific expectations for mobilization will be expressed to the 
patient and pursued: postoperative day (POD) 0 (starting from end of surgery until 
midnight) - up in chair with assistance; POD 1 - up in chair 3 times/day for meals, 
ambulation in room or hallway 2 times/day with assistance; POD 2 - out of bed for all 
meals and >[ADDRESS_1153476] more than 15 meters 3 times/day 
with assistance; POD 3 - increase ambulation (desirably beyond 75 meters) 3 –5 
times/day.   
 
22  
    
Proto
cols to guide the basic requirements for patient care and safety during mobilization 
and ambulation are available in all sites, and followed by [CONTACT_831027]. In the rare circumstances that a contraindication for early mobility is present, 
the intervention will only be implemented when that contraindication is resolved. 
Contraindications include: vasopressor requirement, acute neurologic event, femoral 
catheters, open abdominal wounds, and excessive sedation.  
  
Performance on postoperative incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830914] (in-person or videoconference) by [CONTACT_656105].  Although 
the target is for the unblinded investigator to visit the participant 3 times a day, we will 
consider 2 in-person visits with incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830915]. 
  
Concomitant Interventions:   
    
If 
pain or other barriers are 
identified that prevent/limit 
adequate performance of 
incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830916], the investigator 
will advise the subject to  
report this to their care 
team. Subsequent execution 
of incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]/ 
ambulation will be pursued 
as soon as feasible.  
  
The following perioperative 
management goals will be 
flexibly defined for 
participants in the 
intervention group to avoid both extremes of clinical practice and practice 
misalignment: (a) anesthesiologists will be advised to use continuous positive airway 
pressure of at least 5 cmH 2O during preoxygenation for induction of anesthesia, and 
during the period of spontaneous ventilation preceding removal of the endotracheal 
tube; (b) F IO2 should target normoxia (SpO 2g96%). Hyperoxia should be avoided (i.e., 
the lowest range of F IO2 required to achieve that target should be used, and increases 
in F IO2 done only to maintain that target SpO 2); (c) fluid administration will be aimed at 
neutral intraoperative fluid balance, and total recommended limit f6 mL/kg/h including 
pre-operative (correction of dehydration) and intraoperative administration.  
Hemodynamic management based on goal directed fluid therapy to guide vasoactive 
medications and avoid excessive fluid administration will be suggested to the primary 
care team as a consideration in high-risk cases if patients present no response after two 
fluid boluses. The primary care team will also be advised to maintain neutral fluid Table 4.  Usual care for interventions in 14 US academic

Postoperative Mechanical Ventilation (if applicable): The pre- or intraoperative decision 
to transfer a patient to the critical care unit will be made by [CONTACT_831028]. 
To maintain the basic tenet of a recruited lung into the postoperative period, patients 
requiring mechanical ventilation postoperatively will receive at least one PEEP titration 
maneuver per day as described above and in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_830918]45. This is consistent with the evidence on the beneficial effect of low driving 
pressures to outcomes of surgical8,[ADDRESS_1153477] once a day. In general, this or alternative methods based on 
principles of lung expansion should be attempted if considered feasible by [CONTACT_831029]. Mechanical ventilation in the ICU will be done at the discretion of the 
critical care team. Recruitment maneuvers and PEEP titration are part of the usual care 
of mechanically ventilated ICU patients, and not expected to constitute a significant 
challenge to care providers.

 control group will consist of a usual care  group, managed in a manner consistent 
with routine perioperative medical practice at the participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830919]. This will increase the pragmatic character of the trial, as 
well as generalizability of our results. This design improves safety monitoring by 
[CONTACT_831030]. It also strengthens 
the findings of the trial by [CONTACT_831031]. Details of usual care in 
participating sites are described in Table 4. This survey of practices in our 14 
participating sites indicated that usual care corresponded to minimal individualization of 
intraoperative PEEP, infrequent use of any systematic management of neuromuscular 
blockade, unusual enforcement of incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830920].  
  
Participants in the control group will also be visited (in-person or videoconference) or 
called in the preoperative settings, post-anesthesia care unit, and postoperatively at a 
frequency equivalent to that of the intervention group to reduce the likelihood of bias 
related to less personal attention. At those points, patients will be greeted, and a 
generic conversation held.  
  
  
Study Design Aspects Relevant To All Participants:  
  
Wit
h the exception of the specific intervention elements, anesthetic and postoperative 
management will follow each participating site9s routine clinical practice, according to 
 
24  
  the choices of the primary clinical team caring for the patients. F luid therapy and 
intraoperative fluid balance (crystalloids, colloids, and volume loss) will be recorded for 
analysis. Participants will receive standard local measures to maintain oxygenation, 
hemoglobin, core temperature, blood pressure and heart rate. Postoperative analgesia 
will be typi[INVESTIGATOR_830921] (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] ± opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]) or intravenous 
patient controlled opi[INVESTIGATOR_388583]. Oxygen supplementation postoperatively is 
recommended to be administered if SpO 2<94%  (measured at rest in room air).   
  
Blood Biomarker Analysis and Biobank:   
We will collect blood samples perioperatively at three specific time points (before 
surgical incision, at extubation ±30min at the end of surgery, and 24±12h after 
extubation). Blood collection (10mL at each time point for a total of maximum 30 mL per 
patient) will be synchronized with routine blood draws whenever possible to prevent 
extra needle sticks for the patient. All samples will be sent to the University of Colorado 
for storage as the PRIME-AIR biorepository and they will be analyzed for biomarkers of 
lung injury under the supervision of the study co-PI, [CONTACT_70920]-Bustamante. The 
10mL blood samples will be distributed in EDTA tubes (7.5mL) for plasma collection and  
PAXgene tubes (2.5mL) for RNA collection. The EDTA samples will be centrifuged at  
1,000-2,000 rpm for 10 min, plasma volume aliquoted (0.5 mL aliquots), and frozen at 
80°C until analysis. Following conclusion of the study and unless patients have opted 
out, samples of the PRIME-AIR biorepository will be submitted to the NHLBI Biologic 
Specimen and Data Repository (BioLINCC) ) for the creation of a biobank for future 
studies on PPCs.  
  
  
Study Outcomes  
  
Prim
ary Outcome: The primary outcome is the participant9s PPC severity during the 
first 7 days after surgery. PPC severity will be classified from none to Grade 4 (Table 5) 
based on the most serious PPC occurring during those [ADDRESS_1153478] on the severity of occurring PPCs. We will utilize an 
established scale of PPC severity7,51,52 (Table 5) that has been slightly modified to 
include PPCs defined in recent large trials4,49,50. These modifications aim to maximize 
event detection by [CONTACT_831032]: (a) Mild hypoxemia (Grade 1),  a usual 
clinical trigger for oxygen therapy in acute patients26,49,49,53, associated by [CONTACT_831033]; and (b) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977] (Grade 2), included as an important complication in recent large studies on 
PPCs with a broad definition4,23,54. Accordingly, the proposed modifications will enhance 
PPC detection. Indeed, a recent study by [CONTACT_831034] 
 
25  
  of 48% in the control arm (N=244) in a similar population49. The 7-day postoperative 
period was chosen because it includes the majority of PPCs occurring within the first 
month after surgery7, known to substantially prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]55; and it was 
used in previous large trials7,23.

Seco
ndary Outcomes  (further defined in Appendices I) : We will study Grade 3 and 4 
PPCs (more reliably determined at unsupervised timepoints) at 30 and 90 days to verify 
if short term (7-day) effects persist at meaningful mid-term periods. We will assess a 
sub-set of individual PPCs to identify specific effects, relevant for analysis and clinical 
 
[ADDRESS_1153479] different measures of health care resource 
utilization. Hypoxemia and hypotension are related to the proposed interventions and 
important intraoperative events requiring quantification. Specifically, the following 13 
secondary outcomes will be assessed:   
  
▪ Proportion of participants with highest grade being Grade 1 or 2 through POD 7  
▪ Proportion of participants with highest grade being Grade 3 or 4 through POD 7, 
30, 90  
▪ Proportion of participants with Hypoxemia by [CONTACT_234945] 7 (as defined in PPCs Grade 
1 and 2),   
▪ Proportion of participants with Atelectasis by [CONTACT_234945] 7;   
▪ Proportion of participants with Pneumonia (suspected and proved) by [CONTACT_234945] 7;

bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmias, new ST-segment changes and cardiac 
arrest);    
▪ Length of postoperative oxygen therapy/other respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413];   
▪ Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408];   
▪ Proportion of participants with any major extrapulmonary complications (as 
defined in Appendix I by [CONTACT_831035]59–61);   
  
Exploratory Outcomes  (further defined in Appendices I and IV) : These include [ADDRESS_1153480] those addressing dyspnea and fatigue. Specifically, the following 
exploratory outcomes will be assessed:    
▪ All cause mortality at postoperative days 7, 30 and 90;   
▪ Each of the individual components of the list of pulmonary complications in the 
primary endpoint not included in the secondary outcomes (Table 5);   
▪ Rate of intraoperative muscle weakness;   
▪ Dose of intraoperative vasoactive medications, crystalloids and colloids;  
▪ Length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit;   
▪ Unexpected admission to ICU;   
▪ Length of ICU stay;   
 
27  
  ▪ Rate of each of the major extrapulmonary complications (defined in Appendix I 
by 
[CONTACT_831035]59–61);   
▪ Rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715](s) after initial discharge;   
▪ Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurements (PROMIS®) short forms (Appendix 
IV) addressing: Dyspnea Characteristics, Severity and Functional Limitations; 
and Fatigue, before surgery and 7, 30 and 90 days after surgery.62,63.  
  
Clinically important differences for primary and secondary outcomes: Because a large 
number of patients are affected by [CONTACT_831036], even small 
percent differences in the outcomes to be studied represent a large absolute number of 
patients that could be affected by [CONTACT_831037]. Accordingly, we will consider 
clinically significant: (a) a 10% difference in the primary outcome of the study (the row 
mean score test of a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel, which incorporates both the frequency 
and highest grade of severity of PPCs during the first 7 days after surgery;  (b) 5% 
difference in the rate of composite or isolated PPCs; (c) 5% difference in the rate of 
intraoperative and major extrapulmonary complications; (d) a difference of 12h in the 
length of postoperative oxygen therapy/other respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]; (e) a difference of 
half-day in the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].   
  
Plasma biomarkers.  We hypothesize that the PRIME-AIR bundle will minimize lung 
mechanical injury and inflammation by [CONTACT_830971]. 
Accordingly, it will reduce plasma levels of biomarkers of inflammatory, epi[INVESTIGATOR_830923]. Plasma will be collected from all patients for analysis of a focused 
panel of plasma biomarkers of inflammation (cytokines IL-6, IL-8); epi[INVESTIGATOR_196648] (the 
soluble form of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products, RAGE, and club cell 
protein 16, CC16), and endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2, Ang-2). We will compare 
biomarker levels in the PRIME-AIR bundle vs. control groups before, at the end of and 
24h after surgery. Blood collection in this aim will not only allow for the biomarkers 
analysis, but also for the creation of a biobank for future studies on PPCs.  
  
Blinding: Because the intraoperative and postoperative interventions cannot be 
blinded, each site will have at least 2 members of the research team: one to perform the 
randomization, education, and implementation of the protocol in the operating room and 
postoperative incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]/mobilization during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042] (in-person or 
videoconference); and another, blinded to patient allocation, to assess PPCs and all 
other outcomes . with information obtained from the participant9s medical chart and 
phone calls to the participant (phone script in Attachments/Insight ).  Investigators 
performing biomarker assays will also be blinded to study group.  
  
  
VI. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
  
A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and approved by [CONTACT_831038]. The material below provides an 
 
28  
  overview of the key features of the SAP.  Should there be any discrep ancy between the 
final SAP and material in the protocol, the final SAP will be the definitive version.  
  
Justification of Sample Size. Sample size was estimated using simulations of the 
primary analysis of the primary outcome. Based on these simulations, our sample size 
is 375/group (750 total) being studied. We have formulated the treatment effect in this 
project as a relative percent reduction in PPC rate between groups, not an absolute 
difference between the two groups. With a PPC event rate of 40%, and a treatment 
effect (relative reduction of PPC rate) of 35.29% (so an absolute PPC event rate of 
25.88% in the group receiving the intervention bundle), and no change in the distribution 
of the severity of PPCs, we would have 93% power (α= 0.05, two -sided) for the primary 
analysis. The 35.29% treatment effect was estimated from a Bayesian analysis as the 
lower 10% bound (one-sided) of the highest posterior region based on previous studies 
of aspects of the intervention; this means that we have a 90% expectation that the true 
treatment effect of the entire bundle would be greater than 35.29%. Power increases if 
the PPC event rate is higher than 40%.  
  
Analytic approach - primary endpoints: The primary outcome is the participant's PPC 
severity using a previously published five-point scale7,51,52. Participants are graded from 
0 (no PPC at all) to 4 (most severe PPC) based on the most serious PPC occurring 
during the first seven days after surgery. The analysis will use a Cochran-
MantelHaenszel test (specifically the row mean score test), stratifying by [CONTACT_3725]. This tests 
the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two treatment groups in the 
distribution of the most severe PPC grade during the first seven days of the study. The 
alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between the two treatment groups in 
the distribution of the most severe PPC grade during the first seven days of the study. 
The results of this test will determine whether the study can claim that the intervention 
bundle reduced the average level of PPC severity  
  
We will also compare biological measures of lung function and injury between the 
interventions: (1) lung mechanics and gas exchange; and (2) plasma biomarkers of lung 
injury at baseline, end of and 24±4h after surgery (see secondary outcomes).   
  
Minimizing bias in outcome assessment:  Study of each subject will involve at least 2 
investigators per center: one to perform the randomization and implementation of the 
protocol in the operating room, and another, blinded to patient allocation, to assess for 
postoperative complications.   
  
Analytic approach - secondary endpoints: The type of variable of the secondary 
outcome determines the approach used, as listed in Table 6 below:

Type of Variable  Approach for Primary Analysis

  Binary  For rare events (f 5%): Fisher's Exact  
test
   
For more common events (>5%): Logistic 
regression (to allow for stratification by 
[CONTACT_3725])  
Categorical (> 2 categories)  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test

Wil
coxon Rank Sum test to allow for  
stratification by [CONTACT_3725])  
Time to death   Cox Proportional Hazards Model  
Repeated continuous outcomes (e.g. 
PROMI
S® measures)  Mixed model Analysis of Variance  
  
Addi
tional analyses to fully explore the data will be specified in the SAP.  
  
Interim analyses: We will perform two interim analyses after approximately 1/3 and 2/[ADDRESS_1153481] completed the 7-day follow up. Efficacy will be assessed using a 
Haybittle-Peto boundary of 0.001 at each analysis.  We will be doing a futility analysis at 
the second interim analyses as well.  
  
  
VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
The estimated risks and discomforts involved with participation in this study include:  
  
I. Risks of recruitment maneuvers and PEEP titration: The potential main serious 
risks of the proposed bundle are hemodynamic instability, respi[INVESTIGATOR_830924]. The PEEP values and protocol for 
recruitment maneuvers to be applied in the intervention arm of this study are 
comparable to those from previous studies and intensive care practice in early or 
established lung injury64,65. PEEP levels have been adjusted to lower maximal 
values in the current proposal given that lungs of surgical patients have better 
mechanical properties including recruitability as compared to those of intensive 
care patients. We are also excluding patients with conditions with the potential to 
increase the susceptibility to complications. In addition, ventilator parameters will 
be changed in a manner aimed at minimizing the likelihood of complications, e.g., 
Pplat to be kept under 30-[ADDRESS_1153482] successfully used intraoperative PEEP 
titration in patients comparable to those to be enrolled in the proposed trial during 
our R34 grant, without any serious adverse event. Such expectation of safety is 
reinforced because the intervention will be administered in an intensely 
monitored environment, i.e., operating room.   
 
30  
  Hemodynamic instability can be triggered by [CONTACT_831039] a recruitment maneuver or multiple other reasons during surgery.  
Hemodynamic mild/moderate changes (possible risk) include different degrees of 
hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg or mean blood pressure <60 
mmHg), tachycardia (heart rate >100 bpm) or bradycardia (heart rate <60 bpm) 
and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Hemodynamic instability will be defined as systolic 
blood pressure >160 or <80 mmHg, heart rate >140 or <50 bpm, or deviations by 
[CONTACT_726] 20% in any of those parameters from patient9s baseline for >3 minutes 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391] (rare risks) or cardiac events (extremely rare) (e.g. significant 
arrhythmias, electrocardiogram ST segment changes). These risks are present 
during recruitment maneuvers and mechanical ventilation performed as standard 
of care during surgery. Our intervention is not expected to significantly increase 
these risks, as we include the assessment of hemodynamic stability before the 
initiation of recruitment maneuvers and careful titration of PEEP level. The 
alternative treatment includes maintaining low levels of PEEP, which can 
contribute to insufficient lung expansion, low oxygenation, and increased risk of 
pneumonia after surgery. Of note, stepwise recruitment as proposed in the 
current protocol is associated with less hemodynamic instability.   
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1428], including: Inadequate oxygenation or desaturation, 
defined as a SpO 2<90%  or a need to increase F IO2 by 
 0.2 to maintain the 
targ
eted SpO 2 
96%, hypercapnia (P ETCO 2>4 5 mmHg, PaCO 2>50 mmHg or 
increase by 2mmHg in either parameter compared to before intervention), and 
increase in plateau pressure (P plat >30-32cmH 2O) (possible risks). These risks 
are present during standard of care during surgery and can be related to 
recruitment maneuvers and mechanical ventilation performed but can also be 
due to other factors, e.g., hypotension, and bronchial secretions. Our intervention 
is not anticipated to significantly increase this risk. There are no alternative 
treatments that reliably prevent intraoperative respi[INVESTIGATOR_1428], and we 
have designed the appropriate responses in our protocol to respond in the event 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_830925].   
Sudden hypoxemia followed by [CONTACT_831040] a 
possible trauma to the airways and pneumothorax (rare risk). The PEEP values 
and protocol for recruitment maneuvers to be used in this study are within ranges 
compatible with those used in previous studies and in clinical practice.  
Specifically, recruitment maneuvers to values of [ADDRESS_1153483] been published, 
whereas in this study values of plateau pressure of 30-32 cmH 2O (considered a 
safe limit in patients with acute lung injury) will be used for only 30 seconds. 
PEEP values in the range of 0-20 cmH 2O are used in clinical practice. Recent 
studies actually indicated that values of 8-12 cmH 2O may be necessary to 
prevent injurious alveolar derecruitment due to abdominal pressure. Such 
pressures are expected to be important in cases of abdominal surgery with 
necessary muscle paralysis for surgery, when pressure applied by [CONTACT_831041], surgical retractors and/or operative field manipulation leads to 
compression and derecruitment of the neighboring lung. The alternative 
treatment includes maintaining low levels of PEEP without recruitment 
 
31  
  maneuvers, which can contribute to lung derecruitment, low oxygena tion, and 
increased risk of pneumonia after surgery. Of note, our proposed values for 
recruitment maneuvers are substantially different (lower) from those used in the 
recently published ART trial48.  
II. Risks of neuromuscular blockade monitoring and reversal: insufficient use of 
neuromuscular blockade agents can lead to inadequate surgical cond itions, and 
their excessive use and/or insufficient (or excessive) reversal are associated with 
postoperative muscle weakness. Muscle weakness can lead to atelectasis, 
hypoxemia, swallowing problems, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_830926], 
coughing, pneumonia and need for ventilatory support. These are precisely the 
issues the proposed intervention attempts to address and the risk is 
hypothesized to be reduced in the intervention group. Any sign of muscle 
weakness will be notified to the primary team and recorded. Given that the 
control group will follow usual care practices, any safety issues should be 
detectable during interim analysis. There is no alternative of care since muscle 
paralysis is required for this type of surgery.  
III. Risks of incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830900]: pain and lightheadedness 
related to hyperventilation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_245034]. Other possibl e adverse 
effects are fatigue and exacerbation of bronchospasm. Most frequently these 
either do not occur or are mild and resolved by [CONTACT_831042]. If 
patients develop these symptoms during the study interventions, the intervention 
will be stopped temporarily and symptoms addressed. This may include advising 
the patient to requestpain medication from the primary team or resting 
temporarily. Interventions will be re-attempted when the symptoms resolve and 
patients are agreeable to them. The alternative of not performing or substantial 
delay in those interventions can contribute to insufficient lung expansion, low 
oxygenation, and increased risk of pneumonia after surgery.  
IV. Discomfort and hematoma due to blood sampling: Three blood samples will be 
obtained for the study for the analysis of levels of biomarkers of l ung injury. 
These risks are possible if a new vascular access is required but should be a 
minor temporary inconvenience. We will attempt to obtain these blood samples 
from existing vascular lines and/or simultaneous to the collection of other blood 
sample needed for clinical analyses. This risk is also present for routine medical 
care.  
V. Risk to patient privacy: Patient information and blood samples are collected for 
this study. Patient information will be de-identified and assi gned a study ID but 
there is a possible risk to the patient9s privacy. A list linking patient names to their 
study ID will be kept separate from the data in secure storage. Deidentified data, 
after review by [CONTACT_831043], will be available 
through the NHLBI BioLINCC biorepository. The plan to redact or convert all PHI 
data (e.g. date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830927]; 
rare events will be grouped to minimize the risk of participant identification; site 
will not be identifiable from published or internal data) will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_831044]. Patients will be 
allowed to opt-out of providing the biorepository of blood samples if they do not 
 
32  
  desire to participate in the availability of their blood samp les for future research 
on pulmonary conditions or other research.  
VI. Risk of anxiety: Potential subjects present a possible psychosocial risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_830928] a research stud y. We will 
minimize the risk of anxiety by [CONTACT_831045]: the study is based on 
sound medical reasoning and data, the study is entirely voluntary, they may 
withdraw and have usual care at any time, their doctors have the last say in the 
manner their care will be provided, and that their decision of whether or not to 
participate will in no way affect their care.  
VII. Risk of distress: Participants are at risk of being distressed by [CONTACT_831046]. We will minimize the risk of distress by [CONTACT_831047].  
  
We do not know the risk of fetal harm with the study protocol, thus, pregnant patients 
are excluded.

Cleveland Clinic Foundation:  
 
We are requesting approval for virtual consent for this study as well as approval of a 
phone script to use in the consenting process. 
Please see below for a summary of the remote consent process: 
The main way we plan to consent will be remotely via DocuSign and this process is 
described here. There will be a focus on obtaining patient consent remotely. We are 
proposing to use the new DocuSign (Part 11 Compliant) platform that will allow a patient 
to provide consent remotely via electronic signature. The process of obtaining consent 
will be as follows: 
 
- Once the patient has been determined as potentially eligible, they will be contact[CONTACT_831069] (telephone or video platform) for a discussion regarding this study using 
an IRB  approved phone script. A member of the study team will verify the patient's 
identity, present the consent via email with IRB approved cover letter language (with the 
patients approval to receive e-mail and verifying their email address) along with 
instructions for using DocuSign and answer any initial questions the patient may have. 
 
[ADDRESS_1153490] in the trial, one of the clinical team members will 
again review the consent via remote platform (telephone or video platform), answer any 
remaining questions, and ensure the patient9s understanding. That clinical team 
member will then provide instructions on how the patient will sign the consent via the 
DocuSign platform. The patient will sign the consent electronically. The clinical team 
member will then provide their signature [CONTACT_831089]. 
The clinical team member will document the entire process, including whether the 
patient consented to the trial, in the patient9s electronic medical record. The pa tient will 
be provided a copy of the signed informed consent form. 
 
Any patient not signing consent via DocuSign will follow this procedure for in-person 
consenting: 
- Once a patient has been determined to be potentially eligible for this study, a member 
of the study team will present the study as a potential treatment option to the patient 
during an in-person visit in a private room and answer any initial questions the patient 
may have. After the patient has had sufficient time to review the informed consent, the 
clinical research coordinator will again review the study with the patient, ensure the 
patient9s understanding of the study and answer all of the patient9s questions.  
 
The study team member will then witness the patient signing the informed consent and 
will also sign the informed consent. The patient will be given a copy of the signed 
consent. The study team member will document the entire interview process per IRB 
Policy, including whether the patient consented to the trial, in the patient9s electronic 
medical record. 
 
Protections Against Risk  
The study design implies a high degree of individual attention to each patient during the 
performance of the study. Consequently, safety is evaluated in a continuous basis 
during execution of the study. At least one physician or research coordinator of the 
study team will be available throughout the entire study.   
As an overarching principle, the primary clinical team caring for the patients along the 
study (anesthesiologists, surgeons, and nurses) can intervene at any time if it is 
believed that patients are at risk.   
The planned strategies for protecting participants from identified potential risks related 
to this study include:  
I. Hemodynamic instability: The recruitment maneuver and PEEP adjustment will 
be interrupted if the patient becomes bradycardic or tachycardic, de velops a new 
arrhythmia, or becomes severely hypotensive (systolic blood pressure < 80 
mmHg or mean blood pressure <50 mmHg). The patient will be managed by [CONTACT_831070]. PEEP levels will be 
decreased for any urgent clinical reasons at the discretion of the managing 
anesthesia team. In the absence of an emergency need for change, the 
 
40  
  anesthesia team caring for the patient will consider addressing any reasons of 
hemodynamic changes with intravenous fluids, vasoactive medications, and/or a 
stepwise adjustment of PEEP consisting of reducing PEEP by 2-5 cmH 2O. The 
anesthesia team will reassess repeating the recruitment maneuvers and  
PEEP optimization once the patient is stable (heart rate <100 beats/minute, 
SBP>100 mmHg). Anesthesiologists are experienced at reducing or responding 
to these events during usual care for surgery.   
II. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1428]: It is at the primary anesthesiologist9s discretion to 
change the protocol ventilator settings if any emergent respi[INVESTIGATOR_830932]. In the absence of an emergency need for change, a new PEEP 
optimization will be performed. If it fails to improve SpO 2, FIO2 will be increased 
by 0.1-0.2 until a SpO 2
96% is obtained. If plateau pressures are beyond 30 
cmH 2O, 
we will follow the guidelines provided by [CONTACT_831071]17: if P plat >30 cmH 2O: decrease V T by 
1mL/kg PBW steps (minimum = 4 mL/kg PBW); if later P plat <25 cmH 2O and V T 
<6 mL/kg PBW, increase V T by 1 mL/kg PBW until P plat >25 cmH 2O or V T=6 
mL/kg PBW; if P plat <30 cmH 2O and breath stacking or dyssynchrony occurs, V T 
may be increased in 1mL/kg PBW increments to 7 or 8 mL/kg PBW as long as 
Pplat remains f30 cmH 2O.  
III. Pneumothorax: Before and during any recruitment maneuver, signs of excessive 
airway pressure will be searched for to prevent barotrauma and pneu mothorax. 
During recruitment maneuvers, sufficient depth of anesthesia will be ensured to 
minimize the risk of barotrauma cau sed by [CONTACT_1962]9 gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_830933]. Also, as mentioned before, plateau pressure f30 cmH 2O during 
ongoing ventilation will always be targeted. Anesthesiologists are experienced at 
reducing or responding to these events during usual care for surgery.  
IV. Amongst the potential adverse effects, development of hemodynamic instability 
or worsened oxygenation to increases in PEEP to values g10 cmH 2O during [ADDRESS_1153491]'s discretion if considered clinically needed for any reason, 
including but not limited to: (i) Systolic arterial pressure lower than 90 mmHg for 
more than 3 min not responding to fluids and/or vasoactive drugs; (ii) New 
arrhythmias not responding to the treatment suggested by [CONTACT_831072]; (iii) Need for a dosage of vasoactive drugs at the highest 
level tolerated, upon the attending physician9s evaluation; (iv) Need of massive 
transfusion to maintain hematocrit > 21% (hemoglobin > 7 mg/dl); (v) Life-
threatening surgical complication. The welfare of the patient will always be 
prioritized over their participation in the study. In such circumstances, the 
interventions will be stopped as appropriate.   
V. Risk of muscle weakness due to inadequate muscle paralysis management. Our 
intervention bundle has been designed to reduce residual muscle weakness after 
surgery by [CONTACT_831073]. Thus, our 
 
[ADDRESS_1153492] it and notify the patient9s primary care team. 
Anesthesiologists are experienced at reducing or responding to these risks that 
sometimes occur during usual care for surgery.  
VI. Risk of pain and lightheadedness from incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830934]: Pain will be assessed before starting incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830935]/or ambulation, and these interventions may be delayed  until pain 
is better controlled. Should a participant complain about pain during these 
postoperative interventions to the research coordinator, the interventions will be 
interrupted, and the research coordinator will instruct the participant to inform his 
/her care team about the pain and inability to perform incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_10230]/or 
ambulation. Pain management through oral, intravenous or epi[INVESTIGATOR_830936].  If incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830937], or if standing up is performed too quickly, they can cause a slight temporary 
lightheadedness. The research coordinator will instruct the patient to do the 
incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830938]/or pause until the 
lightheadedness resolves. These two interventions are considered standard of 
care, as are the precautions to minimize their risks. In any case, patient safety 
will be prioritized. The alternative of not performing or delaying those 
interventions can contribute to insufficient lung expansion, low oxygenation, and 
increased risk of pneumonia after surgery.   
VII. Discomfort and hematoma due to blood sampling: In order to minimize patient 
discomfort, we will attempt to synchronize routine blood test sample s for clinical 
care with the collection of blood samples for the study whenever possible. Local 
pressure will be applied to minimize the risk of hematoma. Only experienced 
personnel in venipuncture will attempt to obtain these blood samples.  
VIII. Risk to patient privacy: Patient information will be de-identified and assigned a 
study ID that will be used for all data records and blood sampl es. A list linking 
patient names to their study ID will be kept separate from the data in secure 
storage. Deidentified data, after review by [CONTACT_831074], will be available through the NHLBI BioLINCC biorepository.  The plan to 
redact or convert all PHI data (e.g. date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830939]; rare events will be grouped to minimize the risk of 
participant identification; site will not be identifiable from published or internal 
data) will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_831075]. Patients will be allowed to opt-out the biorepository of blood 
samples if they do not desire to participate in the availability of their blood 
samples for future research on pulmonary conditions or other research. All 
individually identifiable information (signed consent forms, data collection sheets) 
will be stored in a secure, locked, location in the site PI's office. 
 
42  
  Passwordprotected computer databases will be used with limited access t o the 
study data. An electronic data capture (EDC) system at the SDCC will be used to 
store all study data. Participants will be identified only by [CONTACT_831076].  This system, which is both HIPAA and 21CFR11 compliant, is 
secured from unauthorized use within the Partners IT infrastructure used to 
project the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s own hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139245].   
IX. Risk of anxiety: We will minimize the risk of anxiety by [CONTACT_831045]: the 
study is based on sound medical reasoning and data, the study is e ntirely 
voluntary, they may withdraw and have usual care at any time, their doctors have 
the last say in the manner their care will be provided, and that their decision of 
whether or not to participate will in no way affect their care.   
X. Risk of distress: We will minimize the risk of distress by [CONTACT_831077].  
If any incidental findings  are discovered from participants9 interactions with the 
research team, they will be communicated to the patient9s primary medical team as 
appropriate for further handling.   
  
VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
  
In this study, we will determine whether an anesthesia-centered bundle involving 
individualization of PEEP level during abdominal surgery, optimized neuromuscular 
blockade administration and reversal, and supervision of incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]/early 
mobilization after surgery after preoperative patient education will reduce the 
occurrence of pulmonary complications after surgery. Each one of these interventions 
have been suggested in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_830940]. Accordingly, we presume that 
patients receiving the intervention could benefit from it by [CONTACT_7661] a reduced incidence 
and severity of postoperative pulmonary complications.  
Because patients with a large range of intraoperative surgical requirements and 
characteristics related to restriction of lung expansion as well as anthropometric 
characteristics undergo abdominal surgery, use of fixed PEEP values is not likely to be 
an optimal strategy to achieve a protective ventilatory strategy in clinical practice. For 
instance, the PEEP level for optimal lung recruitment in a thin small female patient is 
expected to be substantially different from that required in a large muscular male 
patient. Use of a fixed large PEEP in a higher PEEP interventional arm could lead to 
lung overexpansion in some cases, and insufficient expansion in others, ultimately 
increasing the risk for ventilator associated lung injury. Similarly, in the same patient the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_830941], and the optimum PEEP during 
periods with the surgical retractors constraining the lung expansion, for example, will 
likely be very different than periods without them. Accordingly, we presume that enrolled 
subjects who receive individualization of PEEP settings to achieve optimal individual 
ventilation would have optimal intraoperative mechanical ventilation during abdominal 
surgery and their risk of experiencing pulmonary complications after their surgery may 
 
[ADDRESS_1153493] 
that PPCs add $[ADDRESS_1153494] of each elective surgery, 92,200 additional 
intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, 584,300 additional ICU days, and $3.[ADDRESS_1153495] established by [CONTACT_137656]/NHLBI and a Medical Monitor. The SDCC will perform checks on accuracy and 
completeness of case report forms in StudyTRAX and other electronic data capture 
systems.    
 
The SDCC will generate performance reports for individual sites monthly. The CCC will 
approach sites with performance issues to resolve them in a timely manner.  
  
Because no new medication, new medical interventions, or new device is used in this 
study, except for the risks under the standard medical procedures, no additional 
adverse events are expected. The study design implies a high degree of individual 
attention to each patient during the performance of the study. Consequently, safety is 
evaluated in a continuous basis during execution of the study. The principal investigator 
 
[ADDRESS_1153496] one physician investigator will be immediately available throughout the entire 
study. Adverse events will be discussed with all research staff.   
  
We will comply with all policies and requirements for data safety and monitoring 
specified by [CONTACT_831078] (sIRB), the DSMB, or NHLBI. Consistent with 
NHLBI reporting guidelines, PRIME-AIR investigators will notify the SDCC as soon as 
possible, but no later than seven calendar days after becoming aware of all SAEs, and 
within 15 calendar days of becoming aware of all other AEs. In addition, we propose 
that specific events (listed below) occurring during surgery that might be related to study 
procedures be reported as soon as possible, but not later than seven calendar days 
after the investigator becomes aware of their occurrence, whether serious or not.  
  
AE reporting: There is a high complication rate after major abdominal surgery. Virtually 
any complication could increase duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689158] d, thus, be defined as a 
SAE. For this reason, we propose to follow the approach defined on Table 7 to define 
the subset of AEs that needs to be reported with AE forms, AEs that will be reported as 
outcomes in the daily/discharge forms, or both. A subset of AEs will have expedited 
reporting  to the sIRB and DSMB within 24 hours or 7 days of receipt by [CONTACT_80938], and 
these are described in detail below.

AEs with Expedited Reporting: Only a subset of SAEs will have expedited reporting to 
the sIRB and the DSMB. We propose that only the following categ ories of events have 
expedited reporting (within 7 days of receipt by [CONTACT_80938]):  
• Any unanticipated problem (defined in the Detailed Protocol);  
• Any AE that is serious, unexpected and suspected of being related (probably or 
possibly related) to the study procedures;   
• Any occurrence of hemodynamic or respi[INVESTIGATOR_34300], or pneumothorax, 
occurring during surgery and potentially arising from participation in the study.  
• All adverse events that are serious, unexpected and occurring intraoperatively 
and immediately postoperatively (Day 0-1).   
  
Definition of severe intraoperative respi[INVESTIGATOR_830942]. We 
define the intraoperative adverse events related to severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_830943] (severe 
hypoxemia, pneumothorax) or severe hemodynamic instability as follows:  
• Severe hypoxemia: SpO2 f92% or 2% below the participant's preoperative room 
air value (if that value is f92%) for at least 10 minutes; OR increase in FiO2 to 
1.0 preceded by a SpO2 f95% in the previous 5 minutes (excluding in 
preparation for extubation); AND requiring treatment in intensity or duration 
 
[ADDRESS_1153497].  
• Pneumothorax: presence of air in the pleural cavity occurring during surgery and 
requiring intervention  
• Hemodynamic instability: SBP>160 or <80 mmHg, MAP>120 or <50 mmHg, 
HR>140 or <50 bpm, or deviations by [CONTACT_726] 20% in any of those 
parameters from patient9s baseline for >3 minutes despi[INVESTIGATOR_830944] (e.g. significant arrhythmias, ST segment changes or cardiac arrest); 
AND requiring treatment in intensity or duration beyond the usual intraoperative 
requirements according to the participant9s anesthesiologist  
  
Relatedness is determined by [CONTACT_7880], recognizing that the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_830945]. The reports are also assessed by [CONTACT_831079]. 
 
  
Site-PIs will be instructed to report fatal AEs as soon as possible, latest within 24 h after 
becoming aware of the event. The sIRB, NHLBI, DSMB and CCC PIs will be notified as 
soon as the information is confirmed. The report to the DSMB will be blinded.  
  
Events assessed as unrelated to participation in the study (including hemodynamic 
instability, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1428], and pneumothorax that occur during surgery 
because of causes unrelated to participation in the study or occur after the end of 
surgery and anesthesia) will be reported within [ADDRESS_1153498] the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_830946]. Unanticipated 
problems and AEs that are serious, unexpected and suspected of being related (or 
possibly related) to the study procedures will be discussed at the next weekly Study 
Management Committee meeting. Any occurrence of hemodynamic instability, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1428], or pneumothorax occurring during surgery and potentially 
arising from participation in the study will be discussed at the next weekly Study 
Management Committee meeting.  
 
Because of the importance of these events, this topic will be a standing item on the 
meeting agenda after the first patient is enrolled on the study, and the SDCC notifies the 
 
[ADDRESS_1153499] 
retraining on the intervention bundle if appropriate. All sites will be trained in the 
consistent assessment and reporting of adverse events.   
  
The DSMB letter resulting from its review of AEs and SAEs will be submitted to the sIRB 
within 7 calendar days of receipt.

  Appendix I – De finitions of Outcomes 
 
 
 
List and definitions of secondary and exploratory outcomes:  
 
− All-cause mortality at 7, 30 and 90 days: mortality for any cause within 7, 30, 
and 90 days after the day of surgery; 
 
− Grade 3 and 4 PPCs at 30 and 90 days: individual grade 3 and 4 PPCs within 
30 and 90 days after the day of surgery; 
 
− Presence of each of the individual components of the list of pulmonary 
complications in the primary endpoint (Table 5) within 7, 30 an d 90 days after 
the day of surgery; 
 
− Rate of intraoperative adverse events (hypoxemia, hypotension during lung 
recruitment, need for vasoactive medications and volume replacement, 
muscle weakness.  This will be assessed as TOF<0.9 after extubation, or, in 
the absence of quantitative assessment, clinical assessments such as 
inability to generate a tidal volume above 4ml/kg of predicte d body weight, 
PBW,  at time of extubation or to maintain sustained hand grip or 5-s head lift, 
presence of diplopia or ventilatory failure after extubation); 
 
− Rate of major extrapulmonary complications, defined based on existing 
diagnosis in the medical chart following usual accepted definit ions61 unless 
otherwise specified: 
 
• Cardiovascular: 
o myocardial ischemia or infarction: Increase in serum cardiac 
biomarker values (preferably cardiac troponin) with at least one 
value above the 99th p ercentile upper reference limit and at least 
one of the following criteria65: 
- Symptoms of myocardial ischemia; 
- New ischemic ECG changes; 
- Development of pathological Q waves; 
- Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new 
regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent 
with an ischemic etiology; 
- Identification of a coronary thrombus by [CONTACT_592548]. 
o cardiogenic pulmonary edema: Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is 
defined as evidence of fluid accumulation in the alveoli due  to poor 
cardiac function. 
 
56  
  o arrhythmia: electrocardiograph (ECG) evidence of cardiac rhythm 
disturbance. 
o cardiac arrest: The International Liaison Committee on 
Resuscitation defines cardiac arrest as the cessation of cardiac 
mechanical activity, as confirmed by [CONTACT_831080]68.   
o stroke: defined as an embolic, thrombotic or hemorrhagic cerebral 
event with persistent residual motor, sensory or cognitive 
dysfunction (e.g. hemiplegia, hemiparesis, aphasia, sensory 
deficit, impaired memory).                                                           
 
• Gastrointestinal:  
o bleeding: Gastrointestinal bleed is defined as unambiguous clinical 
or endoscopic evidence of blood in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (or hemorrhage) is that originati ng 
proximal to the ligament of Treitz, in practice from the esophagus,  
stomach and duodenum. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is that 
originating from the small bowel or colon.  
o anastomotic breakdown: Leak of luminal contents from a surgical 
connection between two hollow viscera. The luminal contents may 
emerge either through the wound or at the drain site, or they ma y 
collect near the anastomosis, causing fever, abscess, septicemia, 
metabolic disturbance and/or multiple organ failure. The escape o f 
luminal contents from the site of the anastomosis into an adjace nt 
localized area, detected by [CONTACT_9661], in the absence of clinica l 
symptoms and signs should be recorded as a subclinical leak69. 
o paralytic ileus; Failure to tolerate solid food or defecate for three or 
more days after surgery70. 
 
• Liver Disease:  
Liver failure: serum bilirubin level>34 μmol/L with elevation of  the 
transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase levels above twice normal 
values. 
 
• Acute renal failure: Stage 1 or higher Kidney Disease Improving Global 
Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines71  (Table A1).

(well filled with air) may improve the amount of oxygen in your bl ood, reduce the risk of 
lung infection and other respi[INVESTIGATOR_830964] n eed for breathing 
treatments.  
What we will do:  
• Before  surgery:  We will teach you breathing exercises (incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]).  
• During surgery:  We will use the ventilator (the machine that helps you breath e 
during surgery) to keep your lungs well inflated during your surgery. W e will also 
make sure that your muscles are not weak at the end of surgery. You wi ll be under 
anesthesia for this part and not aware of it. 
• After surgery:  We will work with you so that you do your breathing exercises well 
after surgery. We will also check that you are getting out of be d and starting to walk 
as expected. We will check on you and your medical chart to record your respi[INVESTIGATOR_037], complications and treatments. We will do this several times e very day 
after your surgery until you leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830965] [ADDRESS_1153518] passed after your surgery.  
What we would like you to do:  Follow current recommendations for patients 
after surgery like yours. These include bre athing exercises (incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]) 
and ambulation to keep your lungs open after surgery.  
• Keep the head of your bed elevated (higher than 30°), if possible. 
• Do your breathing exercises ( in centive spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] ). For these:  
o Keep the incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_830966]. 
o Sit up as straight as possible and cough to clear your lungs if needed.  
− Su
pport your incision with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_830967] 
o Place your lips around the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_830968].  
o Breathe in slowly  and as deeply as possible by [CONTACT_831085][INVESTIGATOR_55274]/plate in the chamber of your device to the set target; hol d your breath 
for at least [ADDRESS_1153519] 100 deep breaths/day. 
• As soon as you can after surgery, get out of bed and walk ( am bulation ) 
o Check with your nurses and doctors if it is safe to move, and get assistance. 

 
62  
  o Please ask your nurse or doctor for pain medication if you need it for controlling 
your pain. 
o We hope that you can achieve these goals:  
− Day-of-surgery ( Da y 0): sit up in a chair with assistance.  
− Day after surgery ( Da y 1): sit up in a chair 3 times/day for meals; walk in 
room or hallway 2 times/day with assistance.  
− Day 2 : get out of bed for all meals and for at least 6 hours during the day; 
walk in hallway more than 15 meters (about 50 feet) or approx. 20  steps) 3 
times/day with assistance.  
− Day 3 and on: increase ambulation, ideally walking beyond 75 m (about 
250 feet or approx. 100 steps) 3 –5 t imes/day.

  Appendix III -   Maximal compliance strategy for PEEP titration 
 
Ventilatory 
Settings • Volume-controlled ventilation, square flow-waveform  
• VT=7 mL/kgPBW, adjustment to 6-8 ml/kg PBW if required 
• RR=12 bpm titrated to PetCO 2=35 -45 mmHg  
• FIO2 g0.4 to SpO 2g96 % 
• I:E  ratio started at 1:2 and adjusted if necessary to the pa tient9s 
physiology 
• Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_109907] 20% 
• Maximum acceptable plateau pressure 30 cmH 2O,  VT will be reduced if 
needed to achieve that value 
 Decremental PEEP titration 
When • Immediately following intubation;  
• After any intervention potentially associated with lung collapse such as 
application of surgical retractors, pneumoperitoneum 
insufflation/deflation, disconnection of the endotracheal tu be, tracheal 
suctioning, Trendelenburg position, or if the static respi[INVESTIGATOR_830969] g15%;  
• Otherwise, hourly trials will be done counted from the last trial. 
Recruitment 
maneuver  • Assure adequate muscle paralysis, volemia and hemodynamics 
• Recruitment maneuver: This will consist of a ste pwise incremental 
PEEP maneuver : 
In volume-controlled ventilation, starting from a PEEP=[ADDRESS_1153520]=30-32 cmH 2O cmH 2O (i.e., 
PEEP= 5, 10, 15 and 20 cmH 2O). Remain for at least [ADDRESS_1153521] range.  
Address hemodynamic issues if they occur before advancing to a higher 
PEEP step, and reduce PEEP if needed to prioritize hemodynamic 
management before proceeding. 
Recruitment maneuvers will be performed before the spontaneous 
breathing trial preceding extubation.  
The maneuver will be interrupted if the patient becomes bradycardi c or 
tachycardic (< 60 or > 140 beats per minute), develops a new arrhythmia,  
becomes hypotensive (systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg) or 
hypoxemic (SpO 2 < 8 5%). Incidence of out-of-protocol change of 
ventilatory settings to assure SpO 2>90% , Ppl30 cmH 2O, or at the 
discretion of the patient9s anesthesia providers will be recorded.  
Decremental 
PEEP 
Titration Performed in steps of 45-75 s each until a drop in the static Crs is 
observed. At this point the PEEP is set at the value which reached th e 
recruitment range of P pla teau =30-32 cmH 2O for 30 sec after which the 
chosen PEEP is set to continue ventilation. If a value lower than 20 
cmH 2O was used as the maximal level of recruitment, that will be the 
starting PEEP for the decremental titration.

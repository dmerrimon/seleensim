treatment of biliary cancers is the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin1. There is no clear

2. 
Angiogenesis has been shown to be a potential target for biliary cancers in a variety of small phase II studies
3-5. Ramucirumab  is a novel monoclonal antibody that targets the vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). It is FDA -approved for the treatment of 
advanced gastric canc er, and inhibits tumor-induced angiogenesis through high affinity binding 
to VEGFR26.  
  
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1048534] cancers is 
less than one year. These malignancies are characterized by [CONTACT_765002]
7.  
 Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common form of biliary tract cancers. Internationally, 
Israel has the highest incidence worldwide, with 7.5 cases per 100,000 men and 13.8 case s per 
100,000 women. Other countries with significant incidence rates include Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, and northern Japan
8. In the US, about five thousand new cases are reported every year. 
The incidence has been on the decline owing to the increase in the number of cholecystectomies for other reasons like acute or chronic symptomatic cholecystitis.  Less than 10 percent of patients with GBC live more than f ive years after diagnosis. The mortality is very high and is 
attributed to the late diagnosis and an advanced stage of the disease
9. 
 At the same time, cholangiocarcinoma is a highly fatal cancer of the biliary tree.  In the [LOCATION_002], approximately 5,000 new cases of cholangiocarcinoma are diagnosed annually; these cases are equally distributed between intra -hepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (ECC)
10. Data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_70299] (SEER) indicate that t he incidence of ICC is increasing11. The 
incidence of ICC in the US almost tripled between [ADDRESS_1048535] 29 , 2018

Chemotherapy for biliary cancers  
 
Gemcitabine has been the mainstay of  chemotherapy in biliary cancers . The ABC -01 study was 
a phase II trial that examined the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin in advanced biliary cancers. 86 patients were randomized to gemcitabine alone versus the doublet regimen. The primary endpoint of 6 -month progression-free survival was 45.5% vs. 57.1% in the two arms 
with median time to progression being 8 months with the gemcitabine and cisplatin combination
13. The benefit of the addition of cisplatin to gemcitabine was verified with the 
ABC -02 study, a randomized phase III trial of 410 patients with overall survival as the primary 
endpoint. The authors found that the combination of gemcitabine and cispla tin significantly 
improved median overall survival (11.7 months vs. 8.1 months) and progression- free survival 
(8.0 months vs. 5.0 months) compared to gemcitabine alone1. 
 
Therapy  in refractory biliary cancers  
There has  not been any randomized controlled phase II o r III trials of second or third -line 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_764993]. A recent review of second-line therapy that included 14 
phase II trials indicated a mean overall survival (OS) of 7.2 months, progression- free survival 
(PFS) of 3.2 months and response rate (RR) of 7.7% with second- line therapy14. Similarly, a 
large retrospective review of second line therapy for 300 BC patients from Italy also showed a median OS of 7.2 months
15. A retrospective review from MD Anderson Cancer Center 
indicated a median PFS of 2.7 months (95% CI 2.3-3.8 months) with a median OS of 13.8 
months (95% CI 12-19.3 months) in those receiving second- line chemotherapy for 
cholangiocarcinoma2. There is no “standard” second -line c hemotherapy af ter gemcitabine and 
cisplatin; FOLFOX, irinotecan, capecitabine and erlotinib are used in practice16-20. 
 
Rationale for targeting angiogenesis in biliary cancers  
Expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGFs and angiogenesis play an important role in biliary cancers . VEGF and VEGFR overexpression has been reported in 30-50% of biliary 
cancer  cases and are associated with worse prognosis
21-23. Estrogens interact with insulin -like 
growth factor (IGF1) and its receptor (IGF1 -R) to simulate the growth of cholangiocarcinoma. 
Estrogens also stimulate the expression an d secretion of VEGF- A, VEGF -C and VEGFRs in 
cholangiocarcinoma cell lines potentially altering cholangiocarcinoma proliferation and tumor neoangiogenesis
24. Conversely, inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma proliferation also inhibits 
VEGF expression. Endothelin 1 (ET-1) inhibited the proliferation of cholangiocarcinoma xenografts in nude mice, which was associated with a down-regulation of VEGF- A and VEGF -
C expression
25. 
 A phase II trial of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab  enrolled 35 patients with biliary 
cancers and  resulted in a RR of 40% and PFS/OS of 7.0/12.7 months, which compared 
favorably with historic controls
5. Lubner and colleagues reported a multicenter phase II trial of 
bevacizumab and erlotinib in patients with unresectable biliary cancer. The confirmed partial response rate in this study was 12%, median OS was 9.[ADDRESS_1048536] of bevacizumab in this disease
4. In the ABC-03 trial, Valle and colleagues 
examined the effects of adding cediranib, a pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to 
traditional treatment with cisplatin/gemcitabine. This group performed a randomized phase II 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center 
2015-[ADDRESS_1048537] 29 , 2018  
Page 5 
 
study that included 124 chemotherapy- naive biliary cancer  patients who received 
cisplatin/gemcitabine with or without cediranib.  Patients assigned to cediranib had a 
significantly improved RR compared with patients assigned to placebo. (44% vs. 19%, 
respectively (p = .0036). Patients receiving placebo were also more likely to progres s (28% 
progressive disease vs 10% for cediranib). However, this did not result in improved OS26. 
Modest anti- tumor efficacy against biliary cancers  was also demonstrated with multi- targeted 
anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors including sorafenib and sunitinib3,27-29. 
 
Ramucirumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is a specific and direct inhibitor 
of VEGFR -2, where it binds to the extracellular VEGF-binding domain with high degree of 
specificity and affinity, at pi[INVESTIGATOR_764994]. It thus prevents the binding of the VEGF ligand to the VEGF-R2 receptor. In the phase I trial for patients with advanced solid tumors, (n=37) ramucirumab demonstrated encouraging early evidence of efficacy at a range of dose levels including the one enrolled patient with biliary cancer who experienced stable disease lasting over 5 months
30. Ramucirumab was recently shown to improve survival compared with 
placebo in advanced gastric cancer, with a median overall survival of 5.2 months in the ramuciru mab arm, and 3.8 months in the placebo arm. The main toxicity seen was an increase 
in hypertension in the ramucirumab group
31. Additionally, a double- blind, randomi zed, phase 
III study of previously treated gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers included 665 
patients randomized to raumucirumab plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel32. In this 
study, the combination arm showed an improvement in overall survival (9.6 months vs. 7.4 mths, p=0.017), providing further rationale for the use of ramucirumab in refractory gastric 
cancer.  
 
Initial data with ramucirumab in biliary cancer  
In the initial 43 patient cohort that was enrolled in this phase II trial, 42 patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancers received treatment.  Ramucirumab was well tolerated with 9 grade 3 toxicities including anorexia, dehydration, hypertension, hyponatremia, proteinuria and vomiting.  There were no grade 4 toxicities.  The median PFS for all patients who received treatment was 2.73 months (95% CI 1.91-8.03 months) and median OS was 6.31 months (95% CI 4.7 months – not reached).   The overall response rate was 0% and disease 
control rate (SD + PR + CR) was 44%.  Importantly, 6 patients (13%) were on treatment for > [ADDRESS_1048538] 44 weeks.  In reviewing the genomic data on the 6 patients with prolonged periods of stable disease, we noted that 4 of the 6 harbored mutations in DNA repair pathways (BRCA, FANCA, ARID1A) and [ADDRESS_1048539] is a sterile, preservative-free solution for 
infusion oframucirumab formulated in an aqueous solution at a concentration of 10 mg/mL (500 mg/50-mL vial). The buffer contains 10 mM histidine, 75 mM sodium chloride, 133 
mM glycine, and 0.01% polysorbate 80. It is administered as an intravenous infusion at a 
dose of 8 mg/kg over [ADDRESS_1048540] 29 , 2018

2. Indication 
In the [LOCATION_002], ramucirumab is indicated for the treatme nt of advanced gastric and 
gastroesophageal cancers  either alone or in combination with paclitaxel after prior 
fluoropyrimidine- or platinum- containing chemotherapy .  
 
It is also indicated in combination with docetaxel for treatment of metastatic non -small cell 
lung cancer with disease progression after platinum- therapy.

3. Introduction 
Ramucirumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G subclass 1 that specifically binds to the extracellular domain of the VEGFR2. This prevents the binding of activating ligands (VEGF- A, VEGF -C, VEGF -D) to the receptor. This 
inhibition results in inactivation of downstream signaling pathways that promote migration and proliferation of human endothel ial cells.  
 
4. Preclinical Studies with Ramucirumab
  
Preclinical pharmacodynamic data demonstrated that ramucirumab binds        specifically and with high affinity to human VEGFR2 , and not to murine VEGFR2  or the related human 
VEGF receptors, VEGFR -[ADDRESS_1048541], colorectal, non-small cell lung , and pancreatic cancer models (Ramucirumab investigator’s brochure).    
 
5. Clinical Studies In Gastrointestinal malignancies with Ramucirumab
 
The REGARD trial randomized patients with advanced gastric or GE junction cancers in a 2:[ADDRESS_1048542] supportive care. These patients had previously 
received platinum or fluoropyrimidine therapy. Patients who received ramucirumab has an improvement in 12-week PFS from 15.8% to 40.1% with overall survival being significantly improved as well (5.2 vs. 3.8 months)
31. 
 The RAINBOW trial randomized 665 advanced, refractory gastric or GE junction patients 
to receive paclitaxel plus ramucirumab versus paclitaxel plus placebo. The addi tion of 
ramucirumab to paclitaxel significantly improved median PFS from 2.9 months to 4.4 months. Objective response rate was similarly improved from 16% to 28%. Further, the combination of paclitaxel with ramucirumab resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival from 7.[ADDRESS_1048543] common toxicities reported with Ramucirumab  as monothera py include 
hypertension (16%), diarrhea (14%), headache (9 %), and hyponatremia (6%). Class -related 
effects such as hemorrhage (3.4%), arterial thromboembolic events (1.7%), and gastrointestinal perforations (0.7%) were rarely noted. Infusion- related reactions were 
initially seen in 16% of patients prior to the institution of premedication recommendations.

This study will enroll up to [ADDRESS_1048553] 29 , 2018  
Page 10 
 
This will be an open- label, single arm study with each cycle being 14 days. Ramucirumab  will 
be administered at 8 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 of the cycle. Restaging will be done every 4 
cycles (+/ - 1week).  Treatment will be continued until progression unless other reasons for 
study discontinuation occur as listed in section 8 “ Criteria  for Removal from the Study .” 
Additionally, patients who have therapy interrupted for consolidative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including, but 
not limited to radiation therapy, radioembolization, and chemoembolization) or at the physician’s discretion, will remain on study  for survival analyses.

50 mL IV within 30 minutes prior to treatment  
o Ramucirumab  8 mg/kg in NS to final volume of [ADDRESS_1048555] medical practice.  
 
Specific ad verse events  of concern, whic h may or may not be assoc iated with ramucirumab  
therapy, includ e infusi on reactions, hypertension, arterial  or venous thrombotic events,  
bleeding (hemorrhagic) e vents, and proteinuria. These are specified in greater detail below.  
A cycle of therapy may be delayed up to 3 weeks  to all ow for weather events, patient’s personal 
emerg
encies, observation of holidays, or other unforeseen delays that the Investigator deems to 
be in the
 best interest of the patient. For any dose interruptions, re- initiation of therapy may be 
delayed for a maximum of 30 days to allow recovery from any toxicity. In exceptional cases where subjects are responding, re- initiation of therapy after missing >  30 consecutive days of 
treatment may be done on a case -by-case basis after confirmation with the Primary Investigator.  
 Toxici
ty will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0 (which is available at: 
http://ctep.info.nih.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm) . For any event 
which is apparent at baseline, the dose modification will apply according to the corresponding shift in toxicity grade if the investigator feels this is appropriate, (e.g. if a patient has grade 1 asthenia at baseline which increases to grade 2 during treatment, this will be considered as a shift of 1 grade and treated as a grade 1 toxicity for dose modification purposes).    Dose modifications of ramucirumab  will be done based on the specific toxicit y. Once a dose of

any study drug  has been reduced, it should not be increased at a later time.  Reasons for dose 
modifications or delays, the supportive measures taken, and the outcome will be documented in 
progress notes. Growth factors may be used to tre at hematologic toxicity and will not constitute 
a dose reduction. A maximum of a 3 -week treatment delay is permitted to allow recovery of 
toxicities.

6.3 Hypertension  
If a patien t develops hypertensi on during the study, he/she should be treated wi th 
antihypertensive medications accordin g to standar d medical prac tice. 
 
Grade<3  
• If the hypertensi on is not associated with symptoms, continue ramucirumab  and 
initiate anti-hypertensive therap y.

• If the hypertensi on is associate d wit h symptoms , hold ramucirumab  until 
symptoms resolv e and in itiate an ti-hypertensive therap y. 
• If ramucirumab  therapy is held more than onc e for hypertensi on (ie, symptomatic 
hypertension, m arkedly  elevated blood pressure unresponsive to anti- hypertensive 
therap y), the dose of ramucirumab  should be reduced upon re- treatment (refer to 
protocol for dose and frequency).  A second dose-reduction (refer t o protoco l for 
dose an d frequency) should be undertaken if an addi tional postponement of therapy is 
required. 
 
Grade 3 (systolic  BP ≥ 160 mmH g or di astoli c BP ≥ 100 mmHg; medica l interven tion 
indicated; more than one drug or more intensive therapy than previously used indicated) 
• For Grade 3 hype rtensi on not associ ated with sympto ms, continue 
ramucirumab  with more intensiv e anti-hypertensi ve therap y.  If systolic BP remains ≥ 
160 or di astolic BP  ≥ 100 mmH g > 2 week s after initiation of additional anti-
hypertensive therap y, hold ramucirumab  whil e cont inuin g appropriate anti-
hypertensive therap y. 
• If the hypertensi on is associate d wit h symptoms , hold ramucirumab  until symptom s 
resolv e and initiate anti-hypertensive therap y. 
• If ramucirumab  therapy is held more than onc e for hypertensi on (ie, symptomatic 
hypertension, m arkedly  elevated blood pressure unresponsiv e to anti-hypertensive 
therap y), the dose of ramucirumab  should be reduced upon re- treatment . A second 
dose- reductio n should be undertaken if an additional postponement of therapy is 
required. 
 
Grade 4 or refractory  
Patients with Grade  4 hy pertens ion (life-threatening consequences, e g, malignant 
hypertension, transient or permanent neurologic deficit, hy pertensive crisis; or urgent 
intervention indicated ) or patients whos e hypertensi on is poorly controlled (> 160 mmH g 
systoli c or > 100 mmH g diastoli c for > 4 weeks ) despit e appropriate ora l medicat ion (> 2 oral 
agent s at maximu m tolerate d dose) wil l be discont inued from study therap y. 
 
6.4 Thrombotic Events  
Inves tigator s shoul d perform all testin g required to fu lly character ize arterial  or venous 
thromboti c/vascular events . The incidence, t ype, and diagnostic tests used for the diagnost ic 
confirmation of thrombotic/vascular events will be collected and repo rted. Becaus e of the 
high rate of venous th romb otic events  in patients  with upper gastrointestinal malignancies , 
and becaus e therapy with anti angiogenic agents has been shown to be feasible in the settin g 
of ant icoagulation in patients with upper gastrointestina l maligna ncies, patients who 
develop Grad e 3-4 venous th romboti c events  (deep  vein thrombosis [DVT]  or pulm onary 
embolism [PE]) may continue study therapy  if the even t is not considered to be lif e-
threaten ing in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_41651] , the patient is asymptomatic,  and/or th e 
event can be adequately  treated with low m olecular  weigh t hepari n-based therap y. 
Grad e 3-4 arteria l thromboembo lic events,  or any PE/DVT  occurrin g or intensifyin g during 
anticoagulant therap y, will warrant  discontinuation of study therap y.

6.5 Hemorrhagic Events  
Ramuciru mab therapy should be discont inued in the even t of any Grad e 3-4 bleeding 
(hemorrhagic) event.  
 
6.6 Proteinuria  
If, while on th erapy, a patient h as proteinuria ≥ 2+ per a dipstick (equivalent to 
≥ 100- 300 mg/dl) or routine urinalysis, ramucirumab  therapy will cont inue as 
schedu led, and a 24-hour urine collection will be conducted prior to the subsequen t 
scheduled treatment cycle.   If the protein level is < 2g/24  hours, the pati ent will 
continue on study t herap y at the same dose without in terruption. I f the prot ein level is 2 to 
3 g/24 hours , study therapy  for the subsequent cy cle will be held for up to 2 week s and a 
24-hour urine collection will be repeated.  Treatment will resume at a reduced dose level (6  
mg/kg every other week) once the protein level returns to < 2g/[ADDRESS_1048569] ion (to 5 mg/k g every other week ) is perm itted if the protei n level > 2g/24 hours 
recurs.  The patient w ill be discontinued from the study if th e protein  level  is > 3g/[ADDRESS_1048570]  occurrence of proteinuria  > 2 g/24 hours, or if the protein level doe s 
not return to < 2g/[ADDRESS_1048571] specif ically in the context  of colo rectal  cancer 
(treated  with co mbina tion regimens  including anti-VEGF antibodie s and cytotoxic 
chemother apy)  and  in  advanced  ovarian  cancer .    Thes e  events  may be  associated  
with

extensive abdominal/peritoneal disease burden. Gastrointestinal perforation has 
been reported  from clinical  studies inves tigating ramucirumab . The incidences  of 
these events  to date and presence of s ignificant comorbidities and risk factors  
preclude any defini tive assoc iation with ramucirumab , although ongoing surveillance 
remains  essen tial. Three gastrointestinal perforations have been  reported  in Phase 2 
studi es inves tigating ramucirumab  (overall  incidence,  0.8% of patient s). Two of 
these events  occurred  on the ovarian cancer study (CP12 -0711) and one on the 
prostate cancer  study (CP18-0601). All three cases  were reported  as SAEs;  the events  
on the ovarian  cancer  study included a Grade 4 colo nic perforation (considered 
probably related by [CONTACT_093]) and a Grade 5 bowel perforation (consi dered  
unrelated);  the perforation occurring  on the prostate cancer study was a Grade 3 
rectal  perforation (possibly related) . Each of these events was character ized by 
[CONTACT_765007] l and/o r pelvic  tumor burden, including an obstructing lesion 
immediately  dista l to an area of d ilated  intestine and perf oration (Grade  5 event  on 
the ovari an cancer  study), a diffusely  infiltrated peritoneum (Gr ade 4 even t on the 
ovarian cancer study), and prior pelvic rad iation (Grade 3 event on the prostate cancer 
study ). Ramucirumab  shou ld be per manen tly discontinued in the event  of a 
gastro intestinal perforation. 
 
Concomitant Medications 
Supportive care, including but not limited to anti- emetic medications, may be 
administered at the discretion of the Investigator.  Erythropoietin and G- CSF may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator, consistent with institutional 
guidelines.

4.  Within 72 hours prior to start of the cycle (except for Cycle 1 as noted above). 5.  Imaging should be obtained every 4 cycles  (+/- 1week).  Evaluations earlier than 
every 4 cycles are allowed if, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], this evaluation is in the 
patient’s best interest.    
6. The end of treatment imaging does not have to be repeated if recent imaging has been completed wi thin 4 weeks.  For patients discontinued from the study for reasons other 
than progression, it is recommend to perform every 12 weeks (+/ - 5 week) after the 
End of Treatment Evaluation visit until documentation of progression or for [ADDRESS_1048580] secondary to patient's history of dye allergy, or if the tumor is not adequately seen on CT for the purposes of this study. 
8. Treatment -related adverse events occurring during study treatment or within 30 days 
(window of 28- 35 days allowed) after the last administration of study drug(s) will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization.  If the patient is unable or unwilling to return to M. D. Anderson for this assessment, the patient will be contact[CONTACT_510837].

7.1 End of treatment evaluations  
Within 10 days of decision to discontinue treatment 
• The investigator will evaluate the results of the following clinical and laboratory 
assessments to be conducted at the time the patient discontinues study treatment: 
• Physical examination with neuropathy assessment 
• ECOG Performance Status  
• Weight  
• Vital signs (blood pressure) 
• Hematology:  complete blood count with differential 
• Biochemistry:  glucose, creatinine, BUN, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline 
phosphatase albumin, LDH, total protein, and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, phosphorus, chloride, C02, magnesium, calcium).  Tumor markers (CA19 -9) as 
indicated.   In patients with known Gilbert’s syndrome, it is recommende d to 
perform a direct bilirubin  and indirect bilirubin. 
• Urinalysis  
• Concomitant medication notation  
• Toxicity (adverse events) assessment (including neurologic toxicities)  using NCT 
CTCAE Version 4.0 
• Tumor evaluations including CT scan or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (if recent imaging within 4 weeks, tumor evaluation does not need to be repeated) 
7.2 Follow- up (off -treatment)   
Follow-up/observation for all treatment related adverse events will be through Day 30 (Day 28 to Day 45 allowed) following the last dose of study drug or until resolution or stabilization of the toxicity or start of another treatment regimen. If it is not feasible for the patient to return to M. D. Anderson for the Day 30 toxicity assessment, the patient will be contact[CONTACT_426] p hone for this assessment.  
 Patients with documented (radiological) disease progression at any point during the study will discontinue treatment with study drugs under this protocol. Objective evidence of progressive disease will be recorded at the time of  progression.  Patients without evidence 
of progression while on study, regardless of the number of treatment cycles received, will be followed for progression until it is documented.  If a patient is off treatment with no documented disease progression and no subsequent anti- cancer treatment is received, 
he/she should be followed e very 12 weeks (+/ - 5 week s) after the End of Treatment 
Evaluation visit with tumor evaluations until disease progression is documented or for [ADDRESS_1048582] 29, 2018  
Page 22 
8.  CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM THE STUDY  
 
Subjects who meet the following criteria should be discontinued from study treatment:  
• Disease progression  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable ad verse event(s) as determined by [CONTACT_1963]  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.   
 
9. RESPO NSE EVALUATION 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1048583] criteria (version 1.1, 2009) proposed by [CONTACT_111700]
33.  All patients 
who have measurable disease according to the RECIST criteria and who have their disease re -evaluated will be evaluable for response.  For the purposes of this study, 
patients should be reevaluated for response approximately every 4 cycles.  Note:  Lesions 
are either measurable or non -measurable using the criteria provided below. The term 
“evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy . 
 
9.2 Definitions  
All sites of disease should be followed as either target or non- target lesions, as 
categorized at baseline.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
or 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions, while all other lesions (either additional measurable lesions or non- measurable 
lesions) should be classified as non- target lesions. In cases where a target lesion is 
believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small t o measure, a default value of 5 
mm should be assigned. To ensure comparability, the baseline radiology/scans and subsequent radiology/scans to assess response should be performed using identical techniques (eg, scans performed immediately following bolus c ontrast administration 
should be made with a standard volume of contrast, the identical contrast agent, and preferably the same scanner). The same method, radiological or physical, should be employed and assessed by [CONTACT_331053], when possible.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1048584] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_1048585] scan (with minimum slice thickness no greater than 5mm, or 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461], or 20mm by [CONTACT_13190] X- ray).  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or 
decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Pathological lymph nodes may also be considered as target or non-target lesions.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable (target lesion), a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_1048586] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). Lymph nodes with a short axis ≥ 10 mm but < [ADDRESS_1048587] a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered non-pathologic and should not be recorded. The short axis measurement of any lymph node that is considered a target lesion should continue to be recorded regardless if the node progresses to below 10 mm. This may prevent the sum of lesions from being zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm.  In rare circumstances, when a target lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned.  
 
9.4 Non- measurable disease 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15mm short axis) as well as truly non -
measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non- measurable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]).  For bone and cystic lesions, please refer to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1, 2009). 
 
9.5 Target lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_765009]).  A sum of the 
diameters for all target lesions (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) 
will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters (LD).  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218]. 
 
9.6 Non-target lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Non-target lesions include measurable lesions tha t exceed 
the maximum numbers per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non-measurable lesions. It is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”).   Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1048588] 29, 2018  
Page 24 
Clinical lesions .  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to est imate the size of the lesion, 
is recommended.  Chest x-ray .  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  Conventional CT and Magnetic Resonance Imagi ng.  Conventional CT and MRI should 
be performed to obtain images of [ADDRESS_1048589] normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Cytology, Histology .  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumor s, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to diff erentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
9.8 Response criteria  
Evaluation of target lesions  
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non -target lesions 
including normalization of elevated tumor marker level. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < [ADDRESS_1048590] be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). Complete response must be confirmed at a second tumor assessment not less than 4 weeks apart from the assessment at which CR was observed.  
 Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Partial response must be confirmed at a second tumor assessment not less than 4 weeks apart from the assessment at which PR was observed. 
 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase (and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the sum of LD of measured lesions ta king as references the smallest 
sum LD recorded since the treatment started. Appearance of new lesions will also constitute PD. In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression of non- target 
lesions may be accepted as evidence of disease progression.  
 Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
 Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions and/or maintenanc e of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.

2015-[ADDRESS_1048591] 29, 2018  
Page 25 
Evaluation of non- target lesions  
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level  
• Incomplete  Response/ Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or mo re non- target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
• Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions  
• Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, in such 
circumstances,  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13387], and the 
progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_180184]. 
• Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.

NE = inevaluable.   If a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time 
point, even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since 
disease must have reappeared after CR).  Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, somet imes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions 
were likely still present and in fact, the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these 
circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.  
 
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to docum ent the 
objective progression, even after discontinuation of treatment. In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status.

9.12 Duration of overall response 
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met 
for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.

objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy. The primary endpoint is the progression- free survival (PFS).  A maximum of [ADDRESS_1048599] follow -up date if patients are alive without disease progression. It is 
expected that the median PFS time will be 3 months or more under this study treatment. If the trial continues to accru al of 60 patients and maintains sufficient follow -up to 
observe 35 events (PD/death) with a median PFS of 3 months, then the 95% credible interval for the median PFS would extend from 2.1 to 4.2 months.  
10.3  Futility monitoring  
For futility monitoring, we will monitor PFS using the methods of Thall et al and we will 
stop enrolling patients to the study if the median PFS is not likely to be longer than that 
from the historical data, which is around 3 months.  Specifically, the trial will be stopped if Pr (lamda(E)  >  lamda(S) | data from the trial) < 0.05, where lamda(S) is the median PFS for historical patients under conventional care with an inverse gamma distribution IG(58.25,171.75), which corresponds to a mean of [ADDRESS_1048600] deviation of 0.4 month (variance = 0.16), the corresponding 95% CI of (2.32, 3.88) months. The prior for lamda(E) is assumed to be IG(2.5625, 4.6875),  corresponding to a mean of [ADDRESS_1048601] deviation of 4 (variance=16, the corresponding 95% CI is 0.72-10.67).   Futility monitoring will start once [ADDRESS_1048602] been enrolled. Assuming an accrual rate of 2 per month and an additional follow-up of 6 months, the operating characteristics for the futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_764997] 1 1 below, with results based on 5000 simulations.

 10.4 Toxicity monitoring 
Unacceptable toxicities will also be monitored closely for the study drug using the 
method of Thall et al (1995). Denote the probability of unacceptable toxic ity by T
E,  
Unacceptable toxicity will be defined as follows, using the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.0. For the purpose of toxicity monitoring, only unacceptable toxicities that occur in the first 28 days (i.e., 2 cycles) will be counted when assessing the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106]. That is, a patient will be classified as not having toxicity if the patient has been treated for 28 days and no unacceptable toxicity has been observed.  
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥ 5 days or Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever and/or infection

• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (or Grade 3 with bleeding) 
• Grade 4 anemia  
• Grade 3 or 4 non- hematological toxicity [excluding electrolyte 
abnormalities, alopecia or grade 3 nausea that is correctable with usual 
supportive medications] 
• Dosing delay greater than 14 days due to treatment- emergent AEs or 
related severe laboratory abnormalities  
• Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction with premedication (Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction without premedic ation is not considered a 
DLT)  
• Grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction with or without premedication  
• Drug -related fever ≤ Grade 3 will not be considered a DLT.   
We assume T
E ~ beta (0.3, 0.7).  We will stop the enrollment if at any point Pr(P E > 
0.30 | data)  >0.9. That is, we will stop the trial if, at any time during the study, we determine that there is more than 90% chance that the unacceptable toxicity rate is more than 30%. This toxicity monitoring rule will be applied after the first [ADDRESS_1048604] been enrolled and evaluated, and then in cohort size of 5. The corresponding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_30011] (number of patients with unacceptable toxicities / number of patients) ≥4/5, 6/10, 8/15, 9/20, 11/25, 13/30, 15/35, 16/40, 18/45.  The operating characteristics (OCs) are listed in Table 12.

 Multc Lean V2.1 and OneArmTTE Version 4.1.1 were used for the trial design.  
10.5 Futility monitoring in CTC website  
The Department of Biostatistics will provide and maintain a website (“Clinical Trial 
Conduct”:  https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct/
) for futility 
monitoring for this study. The Clinical Trial Conduct website resides on a secure server, and access is gained through usernames and passwords provided to personnel responsible for enrolling patients and updating patient data.  The website is accessed through a browser using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. Personnel responsible for enrolling patients on trials, which includes the principal investigator(s), research nurse(s), and data coordinator(s), will be trained by [CONTACT_765010] 
2015-[ADDRESS_1048605] 29, 2018  
Page 30 
of the trial website; the importance of timely updating of follow -up times and recording 
of events will be emphasized in training. 
 
10.6 Analysis method 
Data analysis will be performed using SAS or S-plus, as appropriate. The median PFS 
time will be estimated by [CONTACT_54893], along with the 95% credible interval.  Toxicity will be reported by [CONTACT_24975], frequency and severit y. Highest toxicity 
grades per patient per course will be tabulated for adverse events and laboratory measurements.  
 Demographic and baseline laboratory results will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including means with standard deviations, or medians with ranges, histograms and box-plot. Fisher’s exact test and Wilcoxon rank test will be used in the data analyses of categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Progression-free survival and overall survival functions will be estimated usin g the Kaplan -Meier method. The two -
sided log- rank test will be used to assess the differences of time to events between 
groups, and Cox proportional hazards model will also be fitted to evaluate the association between time -to-event outcomes and tumor gene expressions. The correlation between 
pre- and post- therapy CT imaging results will be assessed through Spearman correlation 
and Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to assess whether the change in CT imaging between pre- and post- therapy is statistically significant. In addition, logistic regression 
analyses will be performed to assess the association between CT imaging results or CA19 -9 response (defined as >50% decrease from baseline) and tumor response.  
 11. DATA AND PROTOCOL MANAGEMENT  
Designated r esearch personnel must enter the information required by [CONTACT_510842] (CRFs). The University of [LOCATION_007] MD Anderson Cancer Center’s Clinical Oncology Research (CORE) system, and the University of [LOCATION_007] MD 
Anderson Cancer Center’s Protocol Data Management System 
(PDMS) CRF system 
will be used for this study.  PDMS is a clinical research information management system. The PDMS CRF is an electronic document designed to record all the protocol-required information to be reported on each trial subject.  
PDMS provides data entry templates as defined in the protocol. Laboratory results are automatically transferred from MD Anderson Cancer Center Laboratory Medicine’s server to PDMS each morning. Users must have clearance through the MD Anderson 
Cancer Center Information Services Security Department in order to access PDMS. 
PDM S login is password protected.   The Investigator is responsible for verifying and 
providing source documentation for all adverse events and assigning attribution for each 
event for all subjects enrolled on the trial.   
12. CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
All patients who sign consent for this study will provide consent for the collection of 
previously collected paraffin embedded tissue.  Up to [ADDRESS_1048606] 29, 2018  
Page 31 
microns thick will be requested from the outside institution or prepared from the patient’s 
tumor block, if applicable.  Any residual tumor tissue above what is specified here will be returned to the sending institution.  Collected paraffin embedded tissue will be handled by [CONTACT_765011].  Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_764998].  All the samples extracted from the paraffin tissue used in this study will be code d and identifiers (name, 
medical record number) will not be present on any material that is undergoing analysis.  Patient information and relevant data will be stored on password –protected institution computers behind the institution firewall.  At the closure of this study all unused material will be either returned to the sending institution or destroyed. 
 
When patients are enrolled, we will collect their pre -existing tissue biopsies, if available, 
for testing . The Oligo GEArray® Human Angiogenesis Microa rray profiles the 
expression of [ADDRESS_1048607]’s that are triphasic or liver protocol will be utilized as 
standard of care imaging. This will consist of an arterial phase and  a portal venous phase 
which will be performed on the 64- slice dual -energy CT scanner. All patients will be 
scanned in the cranio- caudal direction from the dome of the liver to the iliac crest during 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_99807] -hold.  Iodinated contrast medium will be intravenously administered via 
an automated dual-syringe power injector according to a body weight. The timing for the arterial phase scan will be determined by [CONTACT_765012]. AP scanning will start after the attenuation coefficient of abdominal aortic blood reached [ADDRESS_1048608] response 
measurements . 
 
13. SAFETY REPORTING OF  ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1 Adverse Event Reporting and Definitions  
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, 
or medical condition occurring after starting the study  drug even  if the event is not 
considered to be related to study drug. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal laboratory values or test results co nstitute adverse events 
only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy.  
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center 
2015-[ADDRESS_1048609], or other assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (mild, moderate, severe or grade 1 -5) 
• Its relationsh ip to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected) 
• Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) 
• Action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse e vent; 
concomitant medication taken; non-drug therapy given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
• Whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE)  
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_058], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected,  it should be followed until its resolution, and assessment 
should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Information about common side effects already known about drug can be found in the Inv estigators’ Brochure  or will be communicated between IB updates in the 
form of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed.  
13.2 A dverse event attribution  
• Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.

The Investigator is responsible for verifying and providing source documentation for all adverse events and  assigning attribution for each event 
for all subjects enrolled on the trial.  
 
13.3 S erious adverse event (SAE) reporting  
A serious adverse event is one that at any dose (including overdose): 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening1 
• Requires inpatient hospit alization or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity2 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event3 
1“Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the serious adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 
3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692602].  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center 
2015-[ADDRESS_1048611] 29, 2018  
Page 34 
A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as 
medically important.   
 
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version  4.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting .  A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the C TEP 
homepage ( http://ctep.info.nih.gov).  All appropriate treatment areas should have access 
to a copy of the CTCAE Version [ADDRESS_1048612] drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for its relationship to the te st drug and for its seriousness. 
Pregnancies  
Pregnancies occurring while the subject (or female partner of a male subject) is on study 
or within [ADDRESS_1048613]’s last dose of ramucirumab  are considered expedited 
reportable events.  If t he subject is on ramucirumab , it is to be discontinued immediately.   
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for Expedited Reporting of SAEs to Lilly . 
Any suspected fetal exposure to ramucirumab  must be reported to Lilly  within 24 hours 
of being made aware of the event.   The patient should be referred to an 
obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.

Global Product Safety Fax Number: ([PHONE_15968] or ([PHONE_15969] 
Investigator Reporting Responsibilities 
The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.   
All adverse experience reports must include the patient number, age, sex, weight, severity 
of reaction (mild, moderate, severe), relationship to drug (probably related, unknown relationship, definitely not related), date and time of administration of test medications and all concomitant medications, and medical treatment provided.   The investigator is responsible for evaluati ng all adverse events to determine whether criteria for “serious” 
and as defined above are present.  The investigator is responsible for reporting adverse events to Lilly  as described below.

Expedited reporting by [CONTACT_765013] (SAE) are defined above.  The investigator must inform Lilly  in 
writing using a Lilly  SAE form of any SAE within [ADDRESS_1048616].  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or laboratory values received after the report) must be documented on a follow-up report.  A final report to document resolution of the SAE is required.  The Lilly  tracking number ( I4T-US-I004) 
and the institutional protocol number should be included on SAE repor ts (or on the fax 
cover letter) sent to Lilly .  A copy of the fax transmission confirmation of the SAE report 
to Lilly  should be attached to the SAE and retained with the patient records. Participating 
study sites must report SAEs to Lilly  as described and  within [ADDRESS_1048617] 
The principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_101400]/her Instituti onal Review Board (IRB) 
of a serious adverse event according to institutional policy.   
Investigator Reporting to the FDA 
Serious  adverse events (SAEs) that are unlisted/unexpected, and at least possibly 
associated to the drug, and that have not previously been reported in the Investigators 
brochure, or reference safety information document should be reported promptly to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by [CONTACT_56638].  Fatal or life threatening SAEs that meet the criteria for reporting to the  FDA must be reported to the FDA within 
[ADDRESS_1048618] be reported to the FDA within 15 calendar days after awareness of the event.  A clear description of the suspected reaction should be provided 
along with an assessment as to whether the event is drug or disease related.    
Adverse event updates/IND safety reports  
Lilly  shall notify the Investigator via an IND Safety Report of the following information: 
• Any AE associated with the use of drug in this study or in other studies that is 
both serious and unexpected. 
• Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center

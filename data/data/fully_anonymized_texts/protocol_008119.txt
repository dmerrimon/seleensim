Study Drug(s)Nintedanib Provided by [CONTACT_23347])
Capecitabine
ObjectivesPrimary: 
•Phase I: To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 
examine the dose-limiting toxicities of nintedanib when administered with capecitabine within the study population and, establish the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D).. 
•Phase II: To assess progression free survival at 18 weeks. This 
will be assessed via the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines after every 3 cycles (9 weeks) of therapy.
Secondary ( phase II ): 
•To assess median progression free survival (at 18 weeks). This 
will be assessed via the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines [after every 3 cycles (9 weeks) of therapy].
•To assess median overall survival from the date of enrollment 
to the time of death will be documented.
•To assess the objective response rate as measured by 
[CONTACT_393] v 1.1.
•To assess the toxicity of dose regimen using the CTEP NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 4.0).
Tertiary:
•Measurement of circulating angiogenic cytokines (CAFs): 
VEGF, sVEGFR 1/2, PlGF, GMCSF, Leptin, IL-1a, IL-8, IL-6, FGFb, Osteopontin, and Pentraxin-3.
•Measurement of drug levels and PK/PD modeling

02.16.16 Page 6 of 90Target Accrual and Study DurationBetween 9 and 18 patients will be treated in the phase I portion of 
this study. Phase I patients (n=6) treated at the recommended phase II dose will be included in the phase II portion of the study. Up to an additional 30 patients will be recruited to the phase II study, for a phase II sample size of 36. The study is expected to accrue 9 patients to the phase I portion for a total sample size of 39 patients (9 + 36 - 6). If 18 patients were necessary for enrollment to the Phase I study, a maximum of 48 patients might be required (18+36-6). Accrual is expected to take up to 2 years, with patients remaining on study for 18 weeks.

02.16.16 Page 7 of 90Statistical AnalysisSample Size Determination: Sample size determination for the 
phase I portion will depend upon the dose-toxicity profile, but is expected to be between 9-[ADDRESS_444791] a minimum difference of 17% in the PFS at 18 weeks, assuming a rate of 25% under standard of care.
Randomization: No randomization is required.
Efficacy Analysis: Primary interest is in the PFS at 18 weeks after 
enrollment. The PFS at 18 weeks will be described by [CONTACT_356684] 90% confidence intervals. All patients in the phase II study and those treated at the RP2D in the phase I study will be included for analysis.
Safety Analysis: Adverse events will be tabulated. AE rates will be 
described using binomial proportions and 90% confidence intervals.  
Correlative Data Analysis: Mechanistic PK/PD modeling will be 
employed , examining the relationship between nintedanib 
pharmacokinetics, modulation of CAFs and PFS.  APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016

have improved the median survival of patients from less than six months to nearly [ADDRESS_444804] or second line setting 
(2, 3). More recently, the data from the TML18147 trial 
demonstrated a modest survival benefit of 1.[ADDRESS_444805]-line setting 
(4). Interestingly, nearly identical survival advantages (approximately 
1.4 months) emerged with utilization of the VEGF-TRAP (aflibercept) with second-line chemotherapy, as well as with the multi-targeted small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), regorafenib, as a single agent in the refractory setting

1.2 Angiogenesis
Angiogenesis is involved in tumour growth and development of metastases. Vascular Endothelial 
Growth Factor (VEGF) and its high affinity receptor VEGFR-[ADDRESS_444806] growth factor (FGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and their associated receptor tyrosine kinases substantially contribute to tumour angiogenesis. The VEGF - VEGFR-[ADDRESS_444807] been explored in the refractory colorectal 
cancer setting to a lesser extent than traditional cytotoxic drugs, predominantly in small phase I and phase II studies. By [CONTACT_356687], very limited activity has been noted, though a sub-set of patients appear to achieve prolonged stab le disease; this may reflect selection bias 
for patients with more indolent disease or perhaps, a group of colorectal cancer patients with tumors persistently dependent upon pro-angiogenic signaling. The NCI TRC-[ADDRESS_444808]: 1 0/17/2016

based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Independent review demonstrated a response rate of only 1%, with a median PFS of 3.5 months and OS of 9 months 
(7). A slightly smaller study utilizing bevacizumab and 
infusional 5-FU in 48 patients with refractory disease showed nearly identical results: a response rate of 6.5%, median PFS of 3.5 months and median OS of 7.7 months 
(8). A third study which 
evaluated the duo of capecitabine and sunitinib, a small molecule TKI of VEGF, KIT, RET, CSF-1R, and FLT3, replicated these results - 47% of patients achieved stable disease, with a median PFS of 137 days (~4.6 months) and a median OS of 291 days (9.7 months), though increased toxicity, namely fatigue and hand-foot syndrome, was demonstrated
(9).
Trials of monotherapy with anti-angiogenic agents have seemingly conferred slightly shorter 
progression free survival advantages. In the refractory setting, aflibercept and sunitinib have separately demonstrated a median PFS of 2-2.4 and 2.2-2.5 months with a median OS of 8.5-10.4 and 7.1 – 10.2 months, respectively
 (10).These numbers are very similar to that achieved by [CONTACT_356688], comparing favorably refractory trials where best-supportive care has supported a progression-free survival of less than [ADDRESS_444809] 4.5-5 months
(6, 11). 
The lack of improvement by [CONTACT_356689] a general reluctance to pursue randomized trials to more definitively evaluate the benefit of continued anti-angiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_356667]. While regorafenib has recently been approved in the chemotherapy refractory setting, the perception of marked toxicity and provision of modest clinical benefit has significantly dampened the initial enthusiasm. Additional regimens which provide clinical benefit with improved tolerability are desperately needed. 
1.4 Nintedanib (BIBF1120)
Nintedanib (BIBF 1120) is a small molecule TKI of VEGFR 1/2/3 (IC
50 34/21/13 nM), FGFR 
1/2/3 (IC 50 69/37/109 nM), and PDGFR A/B (IC 50 59/65 nM), with additional activity against 
Flt-3, RET, Src, Lck, and Lyn. In preclinical colorectal cancer models, anti-tumor efficacy has been demonstrated, with a marked reduction in tumor vessel density. Maximum plasma concentrations occur 2-[ADDRESS_444810] common DLT in early phase trials and a common AE in later stage studies, though predominantly seen at higher doses (> 200 mg bid) and largely reversible with cessation of therapy.
1.5 Preclinical Development and Pharmacokinetics of Nintedanib
Nintedanib (BIBF 1120) is an oral small molecule triple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that 
potently blocks VEGFR 1-3 (vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor), FGFR 1 and 3 (fibroblast growth factor/receptor), as well as PDGFR α/β (platelet derived growth factor 
receptor) in low nanomolar concentrations ( Table 1 ). These receptors are expressed on 
perivascular cells, such as pericytes and smooth muscle cells, that are also involved in tumour angiogenesis and therefore their inhibition may contribute to the overall efficacy of nintedanib. In addition, Nintedanib also inhibits the kinase activity of Flt-3, one of the most frequently APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016

analyzed and showed no inhibition by [CONTACT_356690] (e.g. insulin receptor, HER2, and several cyclin dependent kinases) with the exception of the three members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases: Src, Lck, and Lyn ( Table 1 ). Src is one of the most intensively studied oncogenes and is 
functionally involved in the control of a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, motility, and adhesion. c-Src has been shown to be involved in the development and progression of human tumors 
(12). Lck is functionally required for T-cell activation through 
the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) (13) and possibly T-cell survival (14). Lyn is involved in B-cell 
antigen receptor (BCR) signalling both positively and negatively, i.e. in the initiation of the BCR 
signal and in B cell proliferation.

Nintedanib inhibits the signalling cascade mediating angiogenesis by [CONTACT_356691] (ATP) binding pocket of the receptor kinase domain, thus interfering with cross-activation via auto-phosphorylation of the receptor homodimers.
The specific and simultaneous abrogation of these pathways results in effective growth inhibition 
of both endothelial and, via PDGF- and FGF-receptors of perivascular cells which may be more effective than inhibition of endothelial cell grow th via the VEGF pathway alone. Furthermore, 
signalling by [CONTACT_9266]-receptors has been identified as a possible escape mechanism for tumour angiogenesis when the VEGF pathway is disrupted.
Besides inhibition of neo-angiogenesis, it may alter tumour maintenance by [CONTACT_356692]. Inhibition of receptor kinases may also interfere with 
autocrine and paracrine stimulation of tumour angiogenesis via activation loops involving VEGF, PDGF, and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) utilized by [CONTACT_356693].APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016

02.16.16 Page 21 of 90In addition preclinical models show that nintedanib (BIBF1120) may have a direct anti-tumour 
effect on those malignant cells which overexpress PDGFR and/or FGFR (e.g. H1703 NSCLC cells).
In vitro, the target receptors are all inhibited by [CONTACT_356694]. In 
in vivo nude mouse models, nintedanib showed good anti-tumour efficacy at doses of 50 – 100 mg/kg, leading to a substantial delay of tumour growth or even complete tumour-stasis in xenografts of a broad range of differing human tumour types. Histological examination of treated tumors showed a marked reduction of tumour vessel density by [CONTACT_3450] 80% 
(15).
The metabolism of nintedanib (BIBF1120) was predominantly characterized by [CONTACT_356695] 1202, which was further metabolized by [CONTACT_356696] 1-O-acylglucuronide.  Data collected in this study show that nintedanib (BIBF1120) has a favorable PK and excretion profile with almost no elimination via the urine, only 0.7% of total [14C] radioactivity was eliminated via the urine. The metabolic characteristics are predominantly independent of cytochrome P450-catalysed metabolic pathways 
(16).
A soft gelatin capsule formulation of nintedanib is used in man. After oral administration, 
nintedanib is absorbed quickly. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) generally occur [ADDRESS_444811] after one week of dosing. The 
terminal half-life of nintedanib is in the range of 7 to 19 hr. Nintedanib is mainly eliminated via faeces 
(16).
Nintedanib (BIBF1120) is non-mutagenic, even at high doses.Two exploratory studies in rats revealed a teratogenic effect of nintedanib (BIBF1120) with a 
steep dose/effect relationship and an early onset of embryofetal deaths at low dosages. This effect was observed at dose levels resulting in plasma drug concentrations comparable to or below those in humans. Because the concentration of nintedanib (BIBF1120) in semen is unknown, males receiving nintedanib (BIBF1120) and having sexual intercourse with females of childbearing potential should use latex condoms. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate contraception during and at least [ADDRESS_444812] dose of nintedanib.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of 
nintedanib (BIBF1102) can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.
1.6 Clinical Development of Nintedanib
Nintedanib is being evaluated in several cancers. Additionally, nintedanib has been FDA 
approved for the non-cancer indication idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). As of [ADDRESS_444813]: 1 0/17/2016

02.16.16 Page 22 of 901.6.1 Phase I
Phase I dose selection studies revealed that nintedanib (BIBF1120) is generally well tolerated 
with mild to moderate adverse effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain) and reversible elevati ons of liver enzymes. Initial signs of clinical 
activity including an encouraging rate of patients with stabilization of their tumour of 54% and 68%, respectively; have been observed in patients with various solid tumors 
(17).
Based on the Phase I dose escalation trials with nintedanib (BIBF1120) monotherapy, the 
maximum tolerated dose was defined to be 250 mg for twice daily dosing in Caucasians and 200 mg twice daily in Japanese patients with a manageable safety profile in advanced cancer patients. Based on the overall safety profile, the RP2D for nintedanib as monotherapy is 200 mg bid.
The maximum tolerated dose for combination therapy of nintedanib (BIBF1120) in combination 
with pemetrexed, docetaxel, paclitaxel/carboplatin and FOLFOX is 200 mg bid. Combination of nintedanib (BIBF1120) with other anti-cancer drugs revealed a similar adverse event profile as compared to nintedanib (BIBF1120) monotherapy  except for the chemotherapy related toxicities. 
There was no change of the pharmacokinetic parameters of nintedanib (BIBF1120) or of the cytotoxic compounds due to the combined treatment. Dose limiting toxicity consisted mostly of liver transaminase elevations as in the monotherapy phase I trials with the exception of the combination of nintedanib (BIBF1120) with pemetrexed, where fatigue was the most relevant dose limiting toxicity.
Available pharmacokinetic data indicate that the systemic exposure needed for biological activity 
can be achieved starting with doses of 100 mg nintedanib (BIBF1120) once daily.
The predominant adverse events were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fatigue 
of mostly low to moderate severity. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were mainly confined to reversible hepatic enzyme elevations (AST, ALT, GGT) which increased dose-dependently. Most cases occurring at doses of 250 mg and above, and a very low incidence at doses below 200 mg and were reversible after discontinuation of nintedanib treatment. All adverse events observed after single administration of single doses of nintedanib to healthy volunteers were only of CTCAE grade 1 severity and fully reversible 
(16).
1.6.2 NSCLC
In a phase II trial in NSCLC patients the safety profile of nintedanib (BIBF1120) observed in 
phase I trials could be confirmed. Most commonly reported drug-related AEs were nausea (57.5%), diarrhoea (47.9%), vomiting (42.5%), anorexia (28.8%), abdominal pain (13.7%) and reversible alanine transaminase (13.7%) and aspartate aminotransferase elevations (9.6%) In conclusion it was generally well tolerated and displayed single agent activity in advanced or recurrent NSCLC patients. Median overall s urvival (OS) was 21.9 weeks. Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) 0–1 patients (n = 56) had a median PFS of 11.6 weeks and a median OS of 37.7 weeks. Tumour stabilization was achieved in 46% of patients (ECOG 0–1 patients: 59%), with one confirmed partial response (250 mg bid.)

efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus nintedanib as second line therapy for non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC).  In total, 1314 patients with Stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC (all histologies) who had progressed after 1st line chemotherapy were randomized in 1:1 fashion to either receive Nintedanib 200 mg BID + Docetaxel (n=655) or Placebo BID + Docetaxel (n=659). 
LUME-Lung 1 met its primary endpoint by [CONTACT_30432] a statistically significant improvement of 
PFS for all patients regardless of histology (median PFS 3.4 versus 2.7 months; HR 0.79, p=0.0019) for Nintedanib in combination with docetaxel.
A significant improvement in OS was demonstrated in patients with adenocarcinoma (HR 0.83, 
p=0.0359, median 10.3 to 12.6 months).
Patients with a poor prognosis defined as time since start of 1st line therapy <9 months also 
experienced significant OS improvement from the addition of nintedanib to docetaxel (HR 0.75, p=0.0073, median OS 7.9 to 10.9 months).
The predominant adverse events were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fatigue 
of mostly low to moderate intensity after monotherapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120). Dose limiting toxicities were dose dependent hepatic enzyme elevations that were reversible after discontinuation of nintedanib (BIBF1120) treatment.

Based on a preplanned futility analysis of investigator-assessed PFS, enrolment was halted after 
713/1300 planned patients had been enrolled. The analysis (based on conditional power for PFS by [CONTACT_3138]) suggested that the study was futile and that the primary endpoint of centrally assessed PFS would likely not be met. The futility analysis was based on conditional power; there was no formal testing of null hypothesis as planned for primary analysis no safety issues were identified.
Even though the study was stopped prematurely, the primary endpoint of this Phase III trial was 
met; treatment with nintedanib plus pemetrexed resulted in a significant prolongation of centrally reviewed PFS compared with placebo plus pemetrexed (median PFS 4.4 vs. 3.6 months with a HR 0.83; p=0.0435). The disease control rate was also increased significantly in nintedanib-treated patients. There was no improvement in OS in  nintedanib-treated patients.

A randomized phase II maintenance trial in ovarian cancer in which the efficacy and safety of 
nine months of continuous twice daily doses of nintedanib (BIBF1120) following chemotherapy was investigated, has identified the potential activity of nintedanib (BIBF1120) with a 36-week PFS of 16.3 % compared to 5.0 % in the control group. The safety profile was consistent with findings previously reported for nintedanib (BIBF1120) administered as monotherapy as mentioned above 
(21).
Nintedanib was evaluated in a Phase III randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, 
multicentre ovarian study with 1366 patients.  Patients received nintedanib plus paclitaxel and 
carboplatin or placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin for six cycles. This was followed by [CONTACT_356697] 120 weeks. The trial met its primary endpoint by [CONTACT_5024] a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (HR 0.84; 95%CI 0.72 - 0.98; p=0.0239, median PFS 17.3 months for nintedanib and 16.6 months for placebo). Overall survival data are immature but currently show no trend in either direction. Main adverse events were GI side effects and increased hematological toxicity

1.6.4 Renal Cell Cancer
Nintedanib has been studied in a randomized phase II study in metastatic clear cell RCC with 
sunitinib as the control arm.  Similar efficacy was seen in both arms of this study. AEs observed more frequent in the nintedanib arm included di arrheal, nausea, fatigue and infection, whereas 
AEs more frequent in the sunitinib arm consisted of bleeding, anaemia, hypertension, hand-foot syndrome and stomatitis 
(23).
1.6.5 Hepatocellular Cancer
The efficacy and safety of nintedanib versus sorafenib in Asian Patients with Advanced 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma was investigated in a randomized phase II trial. Nintedanib showed similar efficacy to sorafenib, with a favorable and manageable AE profile. More patients in the sorafenib arm had severe AEs and drug-related AEs compared with patients in the nintedanib arm, and more patients in the sorafenib arm required dose reduction compared with the nintedanib arm. Nintedanib AEs were manageable; in the nintedanib arm there were fewer hypertension, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and transaminase elevation events

For more details please refer to the investigator drug brochure for nintedanib (BIBF1120).1.7 Correlative Studies
Rationale/justification:  A significant challenge in the development and clinical use of VEGF 
pathway inhibitors is the lack of reliable biom arkers that can predict for biological activity, 
patient response and benefit, and toxicity(27). However, results from several prospective and 
retrospective trials analyzing patient blood following the treatment of VEGF RTKIs suggest that consistent changes in the levels of circulating proteins following treatment may be tailored to a 
particular drug, and have the potential as a surrogate biomarker in guiding both dosing and patient outcome
(28-30). This study will evaluate several circulating angiogenic factors (CAFs) in 
patient plasma using ELISA methods. CAFs will include VEGF, sVEGFR 1/2, PlGF, GMCSF, Leptin, IL-1a, IL-8, IL-6, FGFb, Osteopontin, Pentraxin-3, which have been chosen because of previous studies demonstrating i) plasma changes which may correlate to patient response, ii) the potential involvement in resistance or comp ensatory pathways following VEGF pathway 
inhibition, and iii) the potential for disruption based on FGF pathway inhibition (including with Nintedanib) 
(31-34).
1.8 Risks and/or Benefits1.8.1 Nintedanib (BIBF1120)
The risks of therapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120) in adult patients are primarily related to:
•the gastro-intestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain)
•increases in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT)
•fatigue, asthenia and anorexia
Liver enzymes must be followed closely during treatment with nintedanib (BIBF1120).Therapy with the trial drugs must be interrupted in the event of relevant hepatic toxicity and 
further treatment is to be withheld until recovery of the abnormal laboratory parameters.
Impairment of immune and of kidney function, thromboembolic events and GI perforations are 
considered possible side effects of treatment with nintedanib (BIBF1120) as they have been reported for some other drugs in the class of angiogenesis inhibitors. Thus far these side effects have been observed in the trials conducted with nintedanib (BIBF1120), but not to a relevant degree. Hypertension is also supposed to be a possible side effect of VEGFR inhibitors and a slightly increased frequency of hypertension has b een observed in the trials with nintedanib 
(BIBF1120) to a mild to moderate degree and only few cases of CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_444817]: 1 0/17/2016
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study No.:                                                                                        I [ADDRESS_444818] to bleeding as one of the potentially serious side 
effects of antiangiogenesis agents in the LUME –Lung 1 trial involving 1314 patients more bleeding events were reported for nintedanib-treated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients (all grades: 17.1% vs. 10.9%; grade ≥3: 2.9% vs. 1.3%) than for those with adenocarcinoma (all 
grades: 10.9% vs. 11.1%; grade ≥3: 1.5% vs. 1.3%). Fatal bleeding events, serious skin 
reactions, thrombosis, and perforations occurred at  a low frequency and were balanced between 
both arms regardless of histology.
Based upon a non-clinical safety study in vitro , nintedanib (BIBF1120) may have a potential risk 
of phototoxicity (skin and eyes) in vivo . Few cases of photosensitivity reactions (less than 1 %) 
and of CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_444819] been reported from the clinical studies to date. If adequate precautions are taken (avoidance of prolonged ultraviolet (UV) exposure, use of broad spectrum sunscreen and sunglasses), treatment with nintedanib (BIBF1120) is considered safe.
1.8.2 Capecitabine
Common side effects associated with the use of capecitabine include:
•diarrhea, stomatitis, hand foot syndrome, fatigue, lymphopenia, neutropenia, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, alopecia, erythema, and rash
•hepatic insufficiency with hyperbilirubinemia has been observed
•dizziness, headaches, fatigue, anorexia, conjunctivitis, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_356668]
•Cardiovascular side effects have included myocardial infarction/ischemia, angina, 
dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, sudden death, electrocardiographic changes, and cardiomyopathy.
The major clinical side effects observed after therapy with capecitabine are distinct from  
nintedanib (BIBF1120) induced adverse events, yet some overlap may occur e.g. gastrointestinal toxicity or hepatotoxicity (please refer to the labels  included in the investigator site file for listed 
adverse events of capecitabine). In view of the low potential for drug-drug interactions of nintedanib (BIBF1120), it is not likely that enhanced toxicity due to pharmacokinetic interaction between the drug and the cytotoxic chemotherapy will occur. However, due to the partially overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_271179], the occurrence of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may be increased.

(35, 36). When capecitabine and 
infusional 5-FU are combined with additional agents, capecitabine demonstrates a comparatively greater incidence of hand-foot syndrome as well as slightly higher incidence of diarrhea, but lesser rates of stomatitis and cytopenia 
(37). In a US population, the approved dose of 1250 mg/m2 
BID is regarded as causing excess toxicity and 1000 mg/m2 is most commonly employed. In this 
study, we plan to combine nintedanib with capecitabine at the standard 1000 mg/m2 dose. 
Nintedanib will be administered at a dose 25% below the recommended Phase II dose due to concern for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_5171], namely diarrhea. This would represent a novel combinatorial oral chemotherapeutic regimen.
The primary objective will be to assess anti-tumor activity of nintedanib and capecitabine when 
given in combination. Secondary objectives will include assessment of the toxicity of the agents in combination, identification of biomarkers predi ctive of benefit, along with a development of a 
novel PK/PD biomarker driven approach to elucidate the optimal dosing regimen of nintedanib and capecitabine.
The combination of nintedanib and capecitabine would be relevant for treatment in the refractory 
setting and potentially in future investigations as maintenance therapy after initial bevacizumab-based chemotherapy. All patients in this study are expected to have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy with progression or intolerance. To date, there is no data on the efficacy of nintedanib in patients who have progressed on prior anti-angiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. A placebo controlled study of nintedanib in the refractory setting is being conducted, as described (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]). If the placebo controlled study demonstrates a clinical benefit, this current combination may be able to build upon those findings, if this combination demonstrates tolerability. Should the placebo controlled study fail to demonstrate benefit, this regimen may yet create an av enue for further investigation via potentiation of 
nintedanib monotherapy, as previously suggested.

4 METHODOLOGY4.1 Study Design
This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, Phase I/II study of nintedanib and 
capecitabine in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to irinotecan and oxaliplatin based therapy . The study will include a Phase I dose-finding portion, followed by a non-
randomized Phase II component. Nintedanib and capecitabine are both oral formulations, to be taken twice daily as prescribed in the present study. Nintedanib will be administered at a fixed dose as dictated in the protocol. The total daily dose of capecitabine will be calculated based upon actual body weight and split into two comparable portions, and doses of both drugs are to be self-administered approximately 12 hours apart (+/- 2 hours), within 30 minutes of a meal. For the purposes of this study, a cycle will be defined as 3 weeks (i.e., 21 days). Nintedanib is to be self-administered twice daily for 21 days (i.e., 1 complete cycle), while capecitabine will be dosed cyclically, in a 2 weeks on / 1 week off fashion. Disease assessment will occur after every three cycles of therapy (9 weeks). For the Phase I study, patients will be evaluated for toxicity on days [ADDRESS_444822]: 1 0/17/2016

02.16.16 Page 29 of 904.1.1 Phase I
A small initial Phase I lead-in will be conducte d, utilizing a 3+3 design to determine the 
recommended phase II dose (RP2D). The Phase 1 portion provides limited toxicity information about the combination therapy in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer patients. The maximum tolerated (or administered) dose level from the Phase 1 will be utilized as the recommended Phase 2 dose. Two dose levels are planned, with dose level 2 expected to be the RP2D. Full details including the initial dosing strategies and dose escalation schema are present in Section 6.
4.1.2 Phase II
The RP2D from the Phase I study has been determined to be dose level 2. There is no formal 
interim analysis planned or early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. However, toxicity and safety outcomes will be regularly reviewed.
4.1.3 Correlative Studies
For both the Phase I and Phase II study, correlative blood will be drawn at baseline, cycle 1 day 
15, and cycle 3 day 1 for analysis of a panel of cytokines and growth factors (see below), to be correlated to PK data, for a select biomarker pa nel and outcomes. This will be performed only on 
the 1
st 32 patients enrolled in the study only. Following administration of both nintedanib 
(BIBF1120) and capecitabine, PK samples for nintedanib will be collected on Day 1, Cycle [ADDRESS_444823] dose and Day 2 (trough level). In addition, PK samples will be collected on Day [ADDRESS_444824]-dose ( Section 8.10 ). Circulating angiogenic cytokines (CAFs) will additionally be analyzed via 
blood collection on Day 1, Cycle [ADDRESS_444825]-dose. Details of collection and timing are summarized in Section 8.11 .
All participants will sign an informed consent prior to study related tests. All participants will 
meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria summarized in Section 5.1  and Section 5.2 . Participants 
will be treated on an outpatient basis.
4.2 Target Accrual and Study Duration
It is expected that a total of 9 patients will be enrolled at two dose levels in the Phase I portion, 
with potential for a maximum of 18 patients. The number of participants required is a function of the unknown dose-toxicity relationship. Patients treated at the RP2D (n=6) will be included in the Phase II study analysis. Up to an additional 30 patients will be enrolled in the Phase II portion of the study, for a Phase II sample size of 36. Summarily, the study is expected to accrue 39 patients (9 + 36 - 6). However, if toxicity is greater than expected, a maximum of 48 patients 
might be required (18 + 36 - 6). Enrollment is expected to be split between the two sites involved
: Roswell Park Cancer Institute and City of Hope. Thus, in the case of 39 patients being 
enrolled, it is anticipated that approximately 20 patients would be enrolled at RPCI and 19 at City of Hope. Accrual is expected to take up to 2 years. Median PFS has historically stood at approximately 2 months and this study aims to provide a PFS rate at 18 weeks (~4 months) of 40%. It is anticipated that patients will be on study for approximately [ADDRESS_444826]: 1 0/17/2016

5.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities
Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this study.
6 TREATMENT PLAN6.1 Dosing and Administration
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Reported adverse events (AEs) and 
potential risks are described in Section 1.8 . Appropriate dose modifications are described in 
Section 6.5 .
In this study, a cycle will be defined as 21 days. Dosing for capecitabine will be established 
based upon actual body weight, with capecitabine being prescribed in oral (PO) tablet forms of 500 mg or 150 mg. The administration will be twice daily for two weeks (the first 2 weeks of each 21 day cycle), followed by a [ADDRESS_444834]. Capecitabine is to be taken with water, within 30 minutes following a meal. The total daily dose will be calculated with dosing split so that comparable doses are administered, approximately 12 hours apart. The PM dose will be 12 hours (+/- 2 hours) after the AM dose. Doses will be rounded to the nearest 150 or 500 mg tablet increment, but may be rounded down at investigators discretion.
Nintedanib is available in 100 mg and 150 mg capsules, which will be administered twice daily 
for 21 days (i.e., 1 complete 3-week cycle). Both capecitabine and nintedanib may be taken together, with water, within 30 minutes following a meal. Doses should be separated by [CONTACT_3450] 12 hours, with the PM dose being 12 hours (+/- 2 hours) after the AM dose.
Patients will be supplied with medication diaries to assess compliance. If a dose is missed, 
vomited or otherwise not ingested, it will not be replaced; rather, the patient will wait until the next scheduled dose to resume therapy. In the event that dosing is interrupted mid-cycle, the duration of the cycle will not be extended. Doses missed during the interruption will be captured as omitted rather than delayed.

6.5.2 Dose Reduction
As initial measure for the management of side effects, treatment with nintedanib and 
capecitabine should be temporarily interrupted until the specific adverse reaction has resolved to levels that allow continuation of therapy. Nintedanib and capecitabine treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose. Dose adjustments of nintedanib based on individual safety and tolerability are recommended as described in Table 7 and Table 8.
The following dose levels will be used in case dose adjustments are required for management of 
undue toxicity.

Of note, in many cases, it will be difficult to fi rmly establish one of the agents as being causative 
of the adverse event (i.e. fatigue, nausea or diarrhea). As suggested above, in these instances, temporary cessation and/or dose reductions of both nintedanib and capecitabine are to be carried out. In the circumstance that an adverse event, which is not otherwise described herein, is felt to be clearly attributed to one of the two agents, but not the other, the putative inciting agent should be held, with dose modification of that agent only, as appropriate.

•AEs requiring a delay in therapy of > 2 weeks (except as above, in the case that a patient 
is felt to be deriving clinical benefit and, this is first discussed and agreed upon between the individual investigator and the principal investigator.).
6.6 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care6.6.1 Additional precautions and supportive care.
•Diarrhea
Diarrhea was the most frequently reported gastro-intestinal event and appeared in close 
temporal relationship with the administration of docetaxel in the clinical trial LUME-Lung 1. The majority of patients had mild to moderate diarrhoea. 6.3 % of the patients had diarrhoea of grade ≥3 in combination treatment compared to 3.6 % treated with docetaxel alone. 
Diarrhea should be treated at first signs with adequate hydration and antidiarrheal medicinal products, e.g. loperamide, and may require interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy with nintedanib.
•Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting, mostly of mild to moderate severity, were frequently reported 
gastrointestinal adverse events in the clinical trial LUME-Lung 1. Interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120) may be required despi[INVESTIGATOR_182557]. Supportive care for nausea and vomiting may include medicinal products with anti-emetic properties, e.g. glucocorticoids, anti-histamines or 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and adequate hydration.
In the event of dehydration, administration of electrolytes and fluids is required. Plasma 
levels of electrolytes should be monitored, if relevant gastrointestinal adverse events occur.
•Neutropenia and Sepsis
A higher frequency of neutropenia of CTCAE grade  > 3 was observed in patients treated 
with nintedanib (BIBF1120) in combination with  docetaxel as compared to treatment with 
docetaxel alone in the clinical trial LUME-Lung 1. Subsequent complications such as sepsis or febrile neutropenia have been observed.
•Hepatic Function
The safety and efficacy of nintedanib has not been studied in patients with moderate (Child 
Pugh B) or severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Therefore treatment with nintedanib (BIBF1120) is not recommended in such patients. Administration of nintedanib was associated with an elevation of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALKP (alkaline phosphatase), and bilirubin, with a potentially higher risk for female patients.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study No.:                                                                                        I [ADDRESS_444863] liver disorders. Hepatic transaminases, ALKP and bilirubin levels are recommended to be closely monitored after start of therapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120) (periodically, i.e. in the combination phase with docetaxel at the beginning of each treatment cycle). If relevant liver enzyme elevations are measured, interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of the therapy with nintedanib may be required (see Appendix C for procedures for follow-up for 
potential drug-induced liver injury).

progressive disease.
Metabolism of nintedanib by [CONTACT_097]450 enzymes plays only a minor role (5%). Additionally, 
nintedanib did not show relevant induction or inhibition of the major drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes and specifically no irreversible CYP3A4 inhibition. However, if co-administered with nintedanib, strong P-gp inhibitors may increase exposure to nintedanib (e.g. ketoconazole or erythromycin). Thus, such medications are to be avoided unless deemed to be absolutely necessary. In such cases, patients should be monitored closely for tolerability of nintedanib. Management of side effects may require interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy with nintedanib.
Strong P-gp inducers, e.g. rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort, may 
decrease exposure to nintedanib. Co-administration with Nintedanib and potential alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_356673].
Because there is a potential for interaction of drug with other concomitantly administered drugs, 
the electronic case report form (eCRF) must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over-the-counter medications, or alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The Investigator should be alerted by [CONTACT_356698]450 isoenzymes, P-gp inducers or inhibitors.
Aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide containing products should be avoided while 
taking capecitabine. Investigation has documented increase plasma levels of capecitabine and one metabolite with the use of Maalox. Post marketing reports indicate that some patients taking both capecitabine and phenytoin experienced toxic ity with elevated phenytoin levels. The level 
of phenytoin should be carefully monitored in patients taking capecitabine and phenytoin doses 
may need to be reduced.
During cycle 1 of the phase I study, the use of myeloid growth factors (including Neupogen and 
Neulasta) is not permitted. After cycle [ADDRESS_444865]: 1 0/17/2016

Whole blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of nintedanib levels will be collected 
via venipuncture. This will only be performed on the first 32 patients enrolled in the study.
Samples for pharmacokinetic analysis (PK) of nintedanib levels will be collected using 1, 10 mL 
purple EDTA collection tube.
Pharmacokinetic sample (PK) collection will be obtained on:
•Cycle 1/Day 1 – Pre-dosing: PK
•Cycle 1/Day 1 – 0.5-[ADDRESS_444885]-dosing: PK
•Cycle 1/Day 1 – 2-[ADDRESS_444886]-dosing: PK

•Cycle 1/Day 15 – 2-[ADDRESS_444889]-dosing: PK
•Cycle 1/Day 15 – 5-[ADDRESS_444890]-dosing: PK
Note:  All dosing dates and times must be recorded on the study medication diary and in the 
eCRF for all doses taken from the first dose to the day of the last PK sample.
NOTE:  Any samples that have been hemolyzed should be re-drawn if possible.
Nintedanib is degraded by [CONTACT_356701]; therefore, whole blood samples should be 
immediately maintained in an ice bath until centrifuged. Centrifugation for separation of plasm should be done within 60 min  after sampling: 
•Centrifuge whole blood samples as soon as possible at 4°C using a refrigerated centrifuge 
at approximately 3000 rpm for about 10 min.
•Transfer at least 500 μL of the supernatant plasma into polypropylene vials (e.g., Nunc 
cryo-tubes, 1.8 mL).
NOTE: Strictly avoid contamination with erythrocytes: If this occurs, the specimen must be 
centrifuged again.
Plasma will be aliquoted into 2 cryovials per time-point. The screw cap polypropylene cryogenic 
tube will be labeled with the participant’s MR number,(for RPCI participants) participant’s initials, participant’s study number, clinical study number, protocol time point, dose, and protocol day. The samples will immediately be frozen at - 70ºC or below until analyzed.
Samples collected at RPCI will be processed and stored at RPCI’s Hematological Procurement Facility. Frozen samples will then be analyzed in RPCI’s Bioanalytics, Metabolomics & Pharmacokinetic Core Facility:APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016

1 Non-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since SD is used as endpoint for assessment of 
efficacy in trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of study treatment until patients are removed from the study for any reason (the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation). In general, the par ticipant’s best response assignment will depend 
on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria and will be determined by [CONTACT_356703]’s status of target lesions, non-target lesions, and new lesions.

•Symptomatic Deterioration: Participants with global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time, and not related to study treatment or other medical conditions should be reported as progressive disease due to “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration that may lead to discontinuation of treatment include, but is not limited to, symptoms such as:

Response will be confirmed within 9 weeks.
9.6 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline a nd during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].
•Clinical Lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.
•Chest x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.
•Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_444900] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans).
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe  specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.
•PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-
CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016

02.16.16 Page 58 of 90•Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, becau se they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and meas urements will be taken from one assessment to 
the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.
•Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation 
is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological 
response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.
•Tumor Markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be considered in complete clinical response.
•Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable  disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.
•FDG-PET: While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:
•Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.
•No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
•FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016

10 SAFETY EVALUATION10.1 Adverse Events10.1.1 Definition
An adverse event or adverse experience (AE) is  defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
(including an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition) associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related (i.e., the event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment). Therefore, an AE can be ANY unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of ‘unrelated’, ‘unlikely’, ‘possible’, ‘probable’, or ‘definite’). In addition, each study site will also be responsible for reporting causality of AEs to Boehringer Ingelheim as per Section 10.2.1 ).
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan in other study-related documents.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be clinically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF.
However, clinically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated 
in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the CRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number:                                                                                               I 265514
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
02.16.16 Page 60 of 90modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.).
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 x the upper limit of normal associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE  or SAE on the CRF. If the laboratory abnormality 
can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia”
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or etiology changes.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions (Baseline Conditions)
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on an Adverse Event CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs, ECG and Physical Examination Results
Changes in vital signs, ECG and physical examination test results will be recorded as an AE in 
the CRF, if they are judged clinically relevant by [CONTACT_093].
10.2 Adverse Events of Special Interests (AESI)
The following events are considered as Protocol-specified events of special interests:
•Any gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal perforation, leakage, fistula 
formation, or abscess.
In such cases the following additional information will need to be collected, documented in 
the respective comment field of the CRF page and the respective narratives of the SAE, and be forwarded to Boehringer Ingelheim:
oLocation of perforation, leakage, fistula, abscess
oLocation/extent of abdominal tumor manifestations

•Drug-induced liver injury.
Drug-induced liver injury is under constant surveillance by [CONTACT_356704] a protocol-specified adverse event of special interest (AESI). Timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to distinguish an effect of the investigational drug from other causes are important for patient safety and for the medical and scientific interpretation of the finding.
The following are considered as protocol-specified AESI:
oAn elevation of ALT and / or AST > 5x ULN without bilirubin elevation measured in 
the same blood draw sample
oAn elevation of AST and/or ALT > 2.[ADDRESS_444901] combined with an elevation of 
bilirubin to > 1.[ADDRESS_444902] been met and according to Appendix C

Protocol-specified AESI are to be reported to Boehringer Ingelheim an expedited manner similar 
to Serious Adverse Events ( Section 10.4 ), even if they do not meet any of the seriousness 
criteria.

other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the participant.
•Unlikely: The event is doubtfully related to investigational agent(s). The event was most 
likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.
•Possible: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.

Boehringer Ingelheim Reporting Requirements
•The severity of the AE should be judged based on the following:
•The severity of adverse events should be classified and recorded in the eCRF according 
to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) CTEP Version 4 of the NCI CTCAE located at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm Causal 
relationship of adverse event
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors, 
including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de-challenge or re-challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, conco mitant diseases and relevant history. Assessment 
of causal relationship must be recorded for each adverse event.
Causality will be reported as either “Yes” or “No”:
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE (“Yes” is equivalent to: Possible, Probable or, Definite).
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE (“No” is equivalent to Unrelated or Unlikely).

02.16.16 Page 67 of 90Phase II is a single arm – single stage study, where a total of n=36 (including 6 treated at the 
RP2D in Phase I) patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer will be enrolled and treated with a combination of nintedanib and capecitabine, as previously outlined. There is no formal interim analysis planned or early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. However, toxicity and safety outcomes will be regularly reviewed.
Endpoints
•Phase I 
oPrimary: Establishment of the recommended phase II dose.
•Phase II
oPrimary : The primary endpoint is the progression free survival (PFS) at 18 weeks. 
This will be assessed via the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines after every 3 cycles (9 weeks) of therapy.
oSecondary : Median progression free survival will be established. Median overall 
survival from the date of enrollment to the time of death will be documented. Aggregate rates of adverse events as measured by [CONTACT_3989] v 4.0 will be recorded to objectively measure toxicities of the two agents.
The primary objectives of this study are:
oPhase I: To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and examine the dose-
limiting toxicities of nintedanib when administered with capecitabine within the study population and, establish the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D).
oPhase II: To assess progression free survival at 18 weeks. This will be assessed via 
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines after every 3 cycles (9 weeks) of therapy.
12.1 Sample Size Determination
A maximum of 48 participants, 18 in Phase I and up to 30 additional patients for Phase II will be 
enrolled in this study. The number of participants required is a function of the unknown dose-limiting toxicity relationship and 18-week PFS rate. Accrual is expected to take 2 years.
Sample Size Justification: 
In Phase I, using the standard 3+3 design, there will be a minimum of 9 and maximum of 
18 patients enrolled.
In Phase II, the sample size calculations are based on the primary analysis of the 18-week PFS 
rate. Historically, the 18-week PFS rate is 5% and 25% for refractory metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with placebo and regorafenib, respectively. The combination of nintedanib and capecitabine is expected to provide an 18-week PFS of at least 40% in patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. The sample size calculation is based on testing hypotheses concerning the proportion of the treated population alive and progression free [ADDRESS_444912]: 1 0/17/2016
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number:                                                                                               I [ADDRESS_444913] at 18 weeks after start of treatment. A true PFS rate of less 
than p0 = 0.25 is considered unacceptable and evidence of such will deem the treatment not worthy of further study, as regorafenib has historically achieved this success rate. The null and alternative hypotheses to be tested are H
0: p = p 0 versus H1: p > p 0.
This single-stage design requires a total of 36 evaluable patients to achieve approximately  
power to detect a difference of at least Δ percentage points (p 0 versus p 0 + Δ). For calculations in 
this study, p 0 = 0.25, α = 0.10, 1 - β = 0.80 and Δ = 0.17. With these design parameters, the 
sample size was calculated using PASS v11 (38).
12.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Descriptive statistics (as appropriate: n, percent, mean, median, min and max) will be used to 
summarize demographic and baseline characteristics.
12.3 Efficacy Analysis
Objective tumor response will be tabulated overall (and by [CONTACT_230606]). Only 
participants who have completed at least 2 cycles will be evaluable for response.
Primary Analysis : 
The Phase I portion of the study begins by [CONTACT_79323] 3 patients at Dose Level 1 (see Table 2 ). 
Standard 3+3 rules will be followed until the maximum tolerated (or administered) dose is found. The recommended Phase 2 dose will be considered tolerable if DLT(s) are observed in at most [ADDRESS_444914] 2 treatment cycl es at that dose level. Available toxicity 
information about these drugs suggests that Dose Level 2 will be the recommended Phase 2 dose, and that 9 patients will be required for the Phase 1. The 6 Phase 1 patients treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose will be included in Stage 1 of the Phase 2 study.
The Phase 2 study’s primary endpoint is the PFS rate, defined as the proportion of patients who 
survive without disease progression (per RECIST criteria) for least 18-weeks after the start of treatment. Patients who progress or die (due to disease or any cause) prior to 18-weeks will be counted as failures.
The following hypothesis about the true 18-week PFS rate (p) will be evaluated using a one-
sided exact binomial test: 
H
0: p = 0.25 versus H 1: p > 0.25.
If  or fewer PFS responses are observed among the total  evaluable patients, the 	 

	
therapy will be deemed ineffective; otherwise, it will be concluded that the therapy is promising. 
The analysis will be conducted in SAS v9.4 (Cary, NC) at a nominal significance level of α=0.10.
Secondary Analysis : In Phase II the secondary outcomes include: overall (OS) and progression 
free (PFS) survival, and toxicities. A survival event is defined as a patient who experiences death from cancer or any cause, while a patient is considered censored if they are alive at the end of the APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016

Estimates of median OS and PFS will be obtained with corresponding 90% confidence intervals. If the true median OS or PFS with the new treatment is 10.2 or 3.0 months, a 60% improvement over historical controls (6.4 and 1.9 month median OS and PFS, respectively); then Phase II estimates of the median will have interval widths of approximately 9.9 or 3.2 months for OS and PFS, receptively. The observed toxicities and adverse events will be reported as frequencies and relative frequencies, with toxicity rates estimated by 90% Wilson confidence intervals. If the true  overall toxicity or adverse event rate is 
0.10 to 0.50; then Phase II estimates of these rates will have interval widths of approximately 0.[ADDRESS_444916] portion of this study is a Phase 1 study and as such will be monitored and discussed by 
[CONTACT_89504]’s Phase 1 Committee, which meets on a regular basis per the RPCI Data Safety Monitoring Plan. Drug safety will be monitored and evaluated continuously throughout the study including 30 day safety follow-up period by [CONTACT_19201], review ing and analyzing data on AEs, changes in 
laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examination findings. Potential early termination decisions are an inherent part of the Phase 1 study monitoring.
There is no formal interim analysis planned or early termination criteria for the Phase II study. 
However, toxicity and safety outcomes will be regularly reviewed.
12.6 Pharmacokinetic or Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis
PK/PD Modeling:A mechanistic PK/PD model will be developed to characterize the time course of nintedanib 
concentrations in relation to target decreases in sVEGFR-2 and FGF23. Subsequently, diagnostic plots will be created to ascertain whether a trend exists among sVEGFR-2 levels, FGF23, and progression free survival (PFS). If trends exist, these endpoints will also be included in the PK/PD model. A variety of compartmental population PK models will be evaluated using a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach. The PK models explored will be described by [CONTACT_356707]: 1 0/17/2016

The model for IIV will be assumed that the variance is proportional with respect to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_356679]. This analysis will include evaluation of the influence of a limited number of patient covariates, such as demographics along with other cofactors, on the variability in select PK/PD parameters. Based on our sparse sampling approach, prior information on PK parameters and variances can be used with a Bayesian estimation method.  For comparisons of hierarchical models, the change in the minimum value of the objective function (MVOF), a statistic that is proportional to minus twice the log likelihood of the data, will be examined. A change in the MVOF of greater than 7.88 between two hierarchical models represents a statistical difference at a p-level of 0.005 for the addition of one parameter (df = 1). The goodness-of-fit analyses will be additionally assessed by: (1) scatterplots of measured concentrations and weighted residuals versus population predicted concentrations, and weighted residuals versus time since first and last dose; (2) scatterplots of measured concentrations, individual weighted residuals, and absolute i ndividual weighted residuals versus individual 
predicted concentrations; (3) the precisions of the parameter estimates as measured by [CONTACT_356708] (%SEM = standard error/parameter estimate * 100% ); (4) changes in the estimates of IIV and RV; and (5) histograms, boxplots, and plots of quantiles of individual and population weighted residuals ve rsus quantiles of the normal distribution (QQ

Procedures for the follow-up of a potential DILI case 
(Hy`s Law case) in IIS with nintedanib (BIBF 1120)
______________________________________________________________________________
Introduction
Drug-induced liver injury
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) has been the most frequent single cause of safety-related drug 
marketing withdrawals for the past 50 years (e.g., iproniazid), continuing to the present (e.g., ticrynafen, benoxaprofen, bromfenac, troglitazone, nefazodone). Accordingly, detection of drug-induced liver injury of an investigational compound has become an important aspect of patient´s safety guarding in drug development.
The US-FDA has published a Guidance for Industry entitled, “Drug-Induced Liver Injury: 
Premarketing Clinical Evaluation” (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/UCM174090.pdf  ) which outlines the 
detection, evaluation, follow-up and reporting of drug-induced liver injury in clinical trials. 
Drugs that have the potential for inducing severe liver injury may be identified by [CONTACT_356714] (10x-, 15xULN), or the combination of hepatocellular injury (aminotransferase elevation ≥3xULN) and altered liver function (hyperbilirubinemia ≥2xULN) 
which is defined as potential “Hy´s law case” 
if not explained by [CONTACT_356715] (i.e., significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase, ALP, >2X ULN) or some 
other explanation of the injury (e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol hepatitis, concomitant use of other known 
hepatotoxic drugs) . This constellation predicts a poor outcome and although very rare, these 
potential cases have to be well characterized as soon as being identified as other confounding conditions may be the cause.
In further consideration of this FDA Guidance, any potential “Hy’s Law case” has to be reported 
in an expedited manner to the FDA (i.e., even be fore all other possible causes of liver injury have 
been excluded) and be followed-up appropriately. The follow-up includes a detailed clinical evaluation and identification of possible alternative etiologies for the “Hy´s Law case” constellation such as concomitant diseases (e.g. Hepatitis B) and/or other concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_356681].
Although rare, a potential for drug-induced liver injury is under constant surveillance by 
[CONTACT_23274]. Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure patients´ safety.
The concept below has been worked out by [CONTACT_356716] (BI) in order to guard patient´s 
safety and to respond to regulatory requirements. It  is the basis for all clinical studies and should 
be applied as appropriate.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016

The following changes in the laboratory values are considered to be a protocol-specific 
significant adverse event for all patients with normal values for ALT/AST at baseline:
•an elevation of ALT and / or AST > 5x ULN without bilirubin elevation measured in the 
same blood draw sample
•an elevation of AST and/or ALT >2.[ADDRESS_444931] combined with an elevation of bilirubin 
to >1.[ADDRESS_444932] been met.
For patients with elevated ALT/AST values at baseline special considerations apply, if they are 
eligible for inclusion into the trial, e.g. if liver metastasis are present and do not qualify as exclusion criterion. For those special cases the BI contact [CONTACT_356717].
Procedures
1. Protocol-specified significant events are to be reported in an expedited manner similar as 
Serious Adverse Events, even if they do not meet any of the seriousness criteria and documented in the eCRF.
2. Replication of the following laboratory tests for confirmation within 48 hours:
•AST, ALT
•Bilirubin measurement (total and direct bilirubin)
•Alkaline Phosphatase
•Haptoglobin
•Complete blood count and cell morphology
•Reticulocyte count
•CK
•LDH
The results of these repeated laboratory tests must be documented on the eCRF /CRF forms and 
reported immediately via the SAE form to BI.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016

1. Obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample (does not have to be a 24-hour urine)
2. Determine protein concentration (mg/dL)3. Determine creatinine concentration (mg/dL)4. Divide #2 by #3 above: urine protein / creatinine ratio = protein concentration (mg /dL) /
Creatinine concentration (mg/ dL)
The UPC directly correlates with the amount of protein excreted in the urine per 24 hr (i.e., a 
UPC of 1 should be equivalent to 1 g protein in a 24 hr urine collection)
Protein and creatinine concentrations should be available on standard reports of urinalyses, not 
dipsticks. If protein and creatinine concentrations are not routinely reported at an Institution, their measurements and reports may need to be requested.APPROVED RP CI Institutional Review Board: 1 0/17/2016

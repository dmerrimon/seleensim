BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common chronic 
lung diseases that are diagnosed in more than 30 million adults in the [LOCATION_002].1,2  
However, diagnostic error (DE), considered one of the most common and harmful of patient -safety problems by [CONTACT_120845],
3,4 occur frequently with asthma 
and/or COPD and disproportionately affect minorities and the underserved. DE leads to lost opportunities to identify other chronic conditions, avoidable morbidity and mortality, unnecessary costs to patients and health systems , and poor quality of care.
3-[ADDRESS_1268394] 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_903904].20-25  It has been estimated that 30- 50% 
of people with an exi sting diagnosis of asthma and COPD were found to be 
misdiagnosed.11,20,21,26-32  Many of these patients misdiagnose d with asthma and/or 
COPD receive unnecessary respi[INVESTIGATOR_903905], cardiovascular events, and mortality.33-[ADDRESS_1268395] at provider and health 
systems levels.  Previous studies show that primary care providers  (PCPs) lack 
knowledge in existing guidelines and in implementing spi[INVESTIGATOR_903906].11,18,61-[ADDRESS_1268396] had limited results.
32,63,66-68  
A new paradigm to improve guideline based care for asthma and COPD which 
includes spi[INVESTIGATOR_903907] a better understanding of DE and improved patient safety and patient -centered outcomes.  Health Promoters or 
Community health workers (CH Ws) have been supplementing medical care by 
[CONTACT_903953].   
However, studies which include diagnostic evaluations with spi[INVESTIGATOR_903908].   The REDE FINE program (Re ducing Diagnostic Error 
to Improve PatieN t SafEty in COPD and Asthma) will incorporate health promoters  
working collaboratively with PCPs to address identified barriers to guideline based care which includes spi[INVESTIGATOR_903909].  We propose a comparative effectiveness study to better understand the epi[INVESTIGATOR_903910], predominantly minority population with a 
diagnosis of asthma and/or COPD at risk for DE.  
  
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
1. RESEARCH DESIGN  
 This will be a  cluste r-randomized comparative effectiveness trial conducted of patient s 
with a primary care provider  (PCP) diagnosis of COPD  and/or asthma seen in outpatient 
primary care provider clinics (i.e. Family Medicine, Miles Square Health Center, and Academic Internal Medicine)  as well as the CRC (Clinical Research Center)  at the 
University of Illinois Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_903911] C linics

  3. SUBJECT SELECTION, RECRUITMENT, AND INFORMED CONSENT  
 
PCP Selection , Recruitment , and I nformed consent  
 
Primary care providers (PCPs) specializing in internal medicine or family medicine with at least one half day per week outpatient clinic will be included in the study.  We 
Page 4 of 13 
 estimate a total maximum recruitment of 80 eligible PCPs from all sites (approximately  
50 PCPs  from UI Health and MSHC  sites and approximately  30 PCPs  from CCHHS) .  
The recruitment will include a combination of paper letter and email invitations with 
endorsement from the clinic directors  and other supervisors. A list of eligible  PCPs  will 
be obtained from each site from the clinic directors .  A research introduction letter will 
be mailed to the qualifying practitioners as well as an email invitation sent to their email accounts .  The letter and email will be sent simultaneously to ensure contact [CONTACT_903955] a short introduction to why the research is being performed and a description of participants’ roles in the study.  Also included will be a contact [CONTACT_903956].  The letter will include a 
statement that there will be no penalty for not participating.  The letter will also contain a postcard with a stamp, where the eligible PCP checks to agree to participate or decline 
to participate.  The email will instruct them to reply by [CONTACT_903957].  If a 
response is not received in [ADDRESS_1268399] 2 weeks later . Once a PCP  agrees to participate, informed 
consent will be obtained prior  to initiation of any study procedures.  
 
Patient Selection, Recruitment, and I nformed consent  
 
Approximately  500 patients will be recruited for this study  from the FM, AIM, MSHC  and 
GIM sites (A total of 250 from UI Health and MSHC sites and a total of 250 from 
CCHHS  site).  All sites use the same electronic medical record (EMR) system which is 
Cerner Powerchart.  An Information Systems Specialists (ISS) from UI Health  (including 
MSHC)  and CCHHS  will search the administrative data of their respective sites to 
provide a list of  patients meeting the first three of the inclusion criteria listed above and 
are scheduled to be seen in PCP clinics  or the CRC (Clinical Research Center at UIC),  
two weeks in the future.  More specifically , using electronic health records,  within the 
past 12 months, the following patients will initially be identified:  age ≥ [ADDRESS_1268400] one  main tenance respi[INVESTIGATOR_335636] (e.g. long acting beta agonists 
(LABA) , long acting anticholinergics  (LAA) ,inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS), 
phosphodiesterase- 4 inhibitors  (PDE -4i), and at least one of the following 1) diagnosis 
of asthma (ICD -9 493.xx  or ICD 10 J45.xx ), 2) diagnosis of COPD, emphysema, or 
chronic bronchitis (ICD -9 491.xx, 492.xx, 496 or ICD 10 J41.xx, J42.xx, J43.xx, J44.xx) . 
.In addition, our ISS will also only include those who have not had a current procedural 
testing (CPT) codes for spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (CPT codes:  [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE])  or completed order for spi[INVESTIGATOR_903916] [ADDRESS_1268401] them by [CONTACT_250063] a phone screen approximately one week before the participants’ scheduled primary care visit.  The letter will be sent [ADDRESS_1268402] a phone number to call to opt out of the study.  A patient phone screen is conducted to confirm eligibility criteria and the participants’ verbal consent to participate 
in the study is obtained. During the call , we will confirm their scheduled appointment 
date, go over the study, answer any questions, and if the subject agrees , conduct the 
phone screen to verify eligibility criteria.  If eligible, they will be asked to participate in 
the study and if agreeable will be asked to come in [ADDRESS_1268403] agrees to participate, informed consent wi ll be obtained prior to initiation 
of any study procedures.

 4.  DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURES  
 
A) PCP Education and Randomization:  
After obtaining PCP informed consent and prior to patient recruitment, a one hour 
educational session will be held for PCPs participating in the study. The purpose 
of this session is to provide education to PCPs about COPD, asthma, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], 
and GOLD and GINA guidelines (GOLD=Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA=Global Initiative for Asthma). The educational session will 
provide continuing medical education credit to those who attend.  The learning 
objectives will be the following: 1) Review  COPD and asthma disease definition, 
presentation, diagnosis and testing including spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], 2) b e familiar with  the 
GOLD and GINA guidelines and recommendations for therapy.   
 
PCPs  who consented to participate in the study  and completed the education 
session  will be randomized to have their patients who meet the study criteria 
receive the intervention or usual care .

 5. STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
All data will be stored in a secure, locked location. Data will be entered and managed through the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). REDCap is a secure web-based application for building and managing online databases.  REDCap is provided by 
[CONTACT_3490] [ADDRESS_1268414] of the misdiagnosis over time (4 time points: 0, 3, 6, 9, 
12 months) on the quality of life and healthcare utilization, we will fit generalized linear mixed models with time, group, and their inte raction as the main predictors.  Two cluster 
levels, PCP and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], will be specified in the model to account for the dependence 
within clusters
72,73 and an appropriate link function will be used for each outcome. 
Clinical important confounders will also be adjusted in the models. Before these analyses we will use descriptive statistics to describe the sample, and any assumption behind each statistical method will be examined during the analysis. A two- sided p-
value less than 0.05 would be considered as statistical significance. All the analyses will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_4696] 9.2 (SAS Inst., Cary, NC).  
 
For Aim 3:  Costs:   The intervention costs for the study include the cost of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_328693], the time of the CHW/health promoter, and time of pulmonologist to provide periodic oversight of spi[INVESTIGATOR_903937].  In addition to estimating the costs associated with the intervention it will be important to measure the healthcare utilization for participants included in the study.  It is possible that the intervention leads to use of other healthcare resources, particularly if the patient is determined to be free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y disease.  Therefore, we will measure both respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -related and overall 
healthcare costs.  To measure these costs, we will determine overall healthcare utilization and apply unit costs to each of the events. Using chart reviews, we will examine healthc are utilization during the follow- up period.  We will categorize 
healthcare utilization into either respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -related or all other healthcare use.  We will 
apply standardized prices to each of the utilization components to estimate the overall and respir atory -related healthcare resource use during the study period. The 
standardize prices will be based on either the National Committee for Quality Assurance standardize price list for their relative resource use measure or Medicare reimbursement rates.  For medications, we will rely on average wholesale price of 
medications to assign an average price to each of the COPD and asthma- related 
medications.  
 Cost-Effectiveness:  The secondary outcome measures included in the study will be 
used to estimate the effectiveness to be used in the cost -utility analysis. We will use 
responses to the EQ5D to estimate patient utility and use that in calculation of quality -
adjusted life- years (QALY).  The area under the curve will be compared between the 
two groups and the di fference will be the incremental effect used in the cost -utility 
analysis.  
Cost-utility analyses:  We will evaluate the cost -utility of the intervention compared to 
usual care over the study period using recommended methods for cost -effectiveness 
analysis .[ADDRESS_1268415] -effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will represent the cost per gain in QALYs 
for the intervention compared to standard care.  As part of the cost -utility  analysis we 
will evaluate the uncertainty associated with the ICERs.  We will use bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_257363] [ADDRESS_1268416] might experience dizziness, 
cough, or light -headedness. A medication that can open subjects’ airways may be used 
during s pi[INVESTIGATOR_903938]. This medication, albuterol, is in a class of medications (i.e. 
short acting beta agonist) that  is often used to treat subjects suspected with COPD  
and/or asthma as part of usual care. A lbuterol may  sometimes cause tremors /shaking , 
nervousness, dizziness, difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], headache, irregular heartbeats, dryi ng or 
irritation of mouth, sore  throat, upset stomach, and coughing. These effects usually 
disappear within a short time and do not require treatment.  
 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_903939], consent, intervention activities, adverse events, and follow -up.  Although few, if any, intervention- related 
adverse events are anticipated in this study, the study population is at risk for poor outcomes, including life- threatening exacerbations and death  not caused by [CONTACT_903962].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_903940]   
  7. DATA MANAGEMENT  
 Confidentiality  
To help ensure that patients’ health information remains private, we will restrict access to data collected for our study to study personnel only (via use of password- protection 
and locked cabinets for study documents).  Study ID numbers will be generated and will be used when discussing and/or reviewi ng data at study meetings.  Also, study reports 
will report results in aggregate and not contain information that can be used to identify individual patients.  
 Storage of Data  
Data will be collected from participants in the form of questionnaires and will be 
documented in the secure, password protected,  web-based Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap) database available only to members of the research team.   The 
research data  will be stored securely using subject ID numbers and kept for 6 years 
after the end of the study .

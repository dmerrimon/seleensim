Protocol Title:   A Phase 4, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Randomized Withdrawal Study to 
Evaluate the Persistence of Effect and Safety of Valbenazine for the Treatment of Tardive Dyskinesia  
Study Site(s):  Approximately 50 study sites in North America . 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the persistence of effect of valbenazine in subjects with tardive dyskinesia (TD) 
who receive placebo in a double -blind , randomized withdrawal period following open -label 
treatment with valbenazine.  
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the relationship between subject clinical characteristics and persistence of effect  of 
valbenazine during the double -blind, placebo- controlled treatment period.  
• To evaluate the effect of valbenazine on measures of quality of life and disability when 
administer ed once daily for up to 16 weeks.  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of valbenazine administered once daily for up to 16 weeks.  
Study Design:   This is a Phase 4, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study to evaluate the 
persistence of effect of valbenazine 40 mg and 80 mg.  Approximately 120 medically stable male and 
female subjects with clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffec tive disorder with neuroleptic -
induced TD or mood disorder with neuroleptic -induced TD will be enrolled.  
The study includes an initial open -label treatment period for 8 weeks, followed by a double -blind, 
placebo -controlled treatment period for 8 weeks, for a total of up to 16 weeks of treatment.  A final 
study visit will be conducted at Week 20 or upon early termination.   
Before subjects can provide informed consent, the investigator (or designee) must determine whether the subject has the capacity to provide consent for study participation using the University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC).  Only subjects who are deemed to have the capacity to provide consent may sign the informed consent form (ICF).  All 
subjects must sign an ICF prior to the conduct of any study- related procedures.  Subjects will be 
screened for eligibility for up to 6 weeks prior to Day 1  (baseline visit).  
Eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study on Day 1.  Valbenazine will be self -admini stered (in the 
presence of the subject’s caregiver, if a pplicable) beginning on Day 1; the subject will be directed to 
take their dose at about the same time each day.  During the open -label treatment period, subjects will 
receive [ADDRESS_696551] week followed by 80 mg for 7 weeks.

14 May 2019  Page 6 At the end of Week 8, subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_696552] dose they received during the open -label 
treatment period.   Randomization will be stratified based on the use of concomitant antipsychotic 
medicati on; this will include up to 40 subjects who are not using antipsychotic medications (ie, have 
not used antipsychotic medication for at least [ADDRESS_696553] no plans for 
resuming antipsychotic treatment during the course of the study) a nd the remaining subjects will be 
using concomitant antipsychotic medications.  
At any time during treatment (open- label and placebo -controlled treatment periods), subjects who are 
unable to tolerate the [ADDRESS_696554] their dose decreased to 40 mg (d uring the double- blind , 
placebo -controlled treatment period, this will be done in a blinded manner; subjects receiving placebo 
will continue to receive placebo).  Subjects who are unable to tolerate the [ADDRESS_696555], safety, health -related quality of life, disability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) will be 
assessed at scheduled times throughout the study.  Visits during the open -label treatment period, the 
double -blind , placebo -controlled treatment period,  and the final study visit will have windows of 
±6 days.  
Study Population:   Approximately [ADDRESS_696556] be 18 to 85 years of age (inclusiv e) 
and have moderate or severe TD as assessed by [CONTACT_535425] 
(AIMS) Reviewer , based on the subject’s AIMS video recording conducted at screening.  Subjects 
must be psychiatrically stable as determined clinically by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator (or designee), including a 
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score of <50 at screening.  
Duration of Treatment and Study Participation:   The expected duration of study participation for 
each subject is approximately [ADDRESS_696557], Dosage and Mode of Administration:   Valbenazine will be supplied as 
capsules containing 20 and 40 mg of valbenazine (free base equivalent).  The doses that will be used in this study are:  40 mg (taken as two 20 mg capsules) and 80 mg (taken as two 40 mg capsules).  Subjects will swallow the capsules with at least 250 mL of water.  Study drug may be taken with or 
withou t food and should be taken at about the same time each day.
 
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration:   Matching placebo capsules identical in 
appearance will be taken orally once daily with at least 250 mL of water.  Study drug may be taken 
with or without food and should be taken at about the same time each day.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Persistence of effect: 
Persistence of effect after randomization to either placebo or valbenazine will be determined based on the AIMS, adverse events (AEs) of TD, and discontinuation from the study due to lack of efficacy 
during the double -blind, placebo- controlled treatment pe riod.  Persistence of effect after randomization 
to either placebo or valbenazine will be based primarily on the mean changes from the randomization visit (end of Week 8) in the AIMS dyskinesia total score to each visit during the double -blind, placebo-
controlled treatment period . 
The AIMS will be administered by [CONTACT_093] (or designee) at screening, on Day 1, end of 
Weeks 8 , 12, 16, and at the final study visit (end of Week 20 or early termination).  Each AIMS 
administration  will be video recorded following standardized guidelines.  A n External AIMS Reviewer 
will evaluate the subject’s global severity of TD at screening to determine eligibility.  Blinded, Central  
Neurocrine Biosciences , Inc., Study No. NB I-[ZIP_CODE]-TD4002 
Clinical Study Protocol  Amendment No. 2 Final Version  Confidential 
14 May 2019  Page 7 AIMS Video Raters  will score AIMS Items 1  through 7 of the AIMS  video recordings from Day  1, end 
of Weeks 8, 12, 16, and the final study visit (end of Week 20 or early termination).  
Health -related quality life and disability:  
The EuroQol  5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ -5D-5L) (to assess health -related quality of life) and the 
Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) (to assess disability) will be completed by [CONTACT_26259] 1, at 
Weeks 8 and 16, and at the final study visit ( end of Week 20 or early t ermination).  
Plasma drug exposure:  
Blood samples to evaluate plasma concentrations of valbenazine and the active metabolite NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 
(other metabolites may be evaluated) will be collected on Day 1 , and at the end of Weeks 8, 12, and 
16. 
Safety:  
Safety and  tolerability will be monitored throughout the study and will include the following 
assessments for all subjects:  
All subjects:  
• AEs 
• Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis)  
• Vital signs (including orthostatic blood pressures and pulse)  
• Physical examinations  
• 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
• Suicidal ideation and behavior – evaluated using the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
(C-SSRS)  
• BPRS  
Statistical Methods:  Descriptive statistics, including confidence intervals, will be used to evaluate the 
persistence of effect of valbenazine during the double -blind, placebo- controlled treatment period.  The 
primary measure of persistence of effect is the mean change from th e end of the open -label treatment 
period (Week 8) in the AIMS dyskinesia total score (based on AIMS scores provided by [CONTACT_11136], 
Central AIMS Video Raters) in subjects who receive placebo during the double -blind, placebo-
controlled treatment period.  The re lationship between subject clinical characteristics (including 
psychiatric diagnosis, age, gender, concomitant use of antipsychotic medications, and other parameters) and the persistence of effect of valbenazine during the double -blind, placebo- controlled 
treatment period will be evaluated using descriptive statistics and graphical methods.  Safety, PK, 
health -related quality of life, and disability data will be summarized with descriptive statistics.

• Good Clinical Practice:  Consolidated Guideline ( International Council for Harmonisation 
of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH; current version]). 
• [LOCATION_002] (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) dealing with clinical studies (21 CFR parts 50, 54, 56, 312, and 314). 
The ethical requirements of Institutional Review Boards/Ethics Committees (IRBs/ECs) and the informed consent forms (ICFs) are discussed in Section  14. 
5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background 
Valbenazine (valbenazine tosylate, NBI -[ZIP_CODE]) is a selective, orally active vesicular monoamine 
transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor developed by [CONTACT_11148].  Valbenazine was approved by [CONTACT_3133] ( FDA ) in April 2017 for the treatment of adul ts with tardive dyskinesia 
(TD), under the trade name [CONTACT_263853]
®.  Valbenazine is also under development for the 
treatment of Tourette syndrome (TS).   
TD is a neurological condition characterized by [CONTACT_535426] 
(ie, tongue , lips, jaw, face), the extremities, and trunk.  While isolated case reports of TD after 
short- term exposure exist, most often TD develops after long -term neuroleptic drug use and often 
persists after discontinuation of such medications.   The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (DSM) Fifth Edition defines chronic exposure to neuroleptics as a criterion for 
TD diagnosis.  In addition to duration and amount of neuroleptic exposure, other risk factors for 
TD appear to include older age, schizophrenia, and cognitive impairment  
(Margolese et  al., 2005).  TD can be disabling, lead to bodily harm (eg, lip or tongue lacerations, 
falls), interfere with activities of daily living, and result in social isolation.  
5.2. Valbenazine (NBI -[ZIP_CODE]) 
In nonclinical studies, valbenazine appears to cause little or no cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 
inhibition or induction at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.  Valbenazine is a moderate 
inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but only at concentrations that  could be achieved in the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is not an inhibitor of a panel of other drug transporters.  Metabolism of valbenazine is characterized by [CONTACT_535427] -[ZIP_CODE], and 
CYP3A4/5-dependent mono- oxidation to NBI-136110.  NBI-[ADDRESS_696565] been conducted in healthy subjects (including 
drug- drug interaction studies conducted with digoxin, ketoconazole, midazolam, and rifampin), 
Neurocrine Biosciences , Inc., Study No. NB I-[ZIP_CODE]-TD4002 
Clinical Study Protocol  Amendment No. [ADDRESS_696566] been exposed to valbenazine in clinical studies.  
Valbenazine appears to be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_19627] a time to maximum plasma concentration (t
max) 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_263798] 0.5  to 1.0 hours.  Valbenazine reaches steady state within 
1 week.  The active metabolite NBI -[ZIP_CODE] gradually forms with a t max of 4 to 8 hours and both 
valbenazine and NBI -[ZIP_CODE] are eliminated with a terminal half -life (t ½) of 15 to 22 hours.  
Coadministration of ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor) with valbenazine led to a 1.5 - 
and 1.6- fold increase in the maximum plasma concentration (C max) of valbenazine and 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE], respectively, and a 2.1- fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration  
versus time curve ( AUC ) from 0 hours extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞) of valbenazine and 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE].  Coadministration of valbenazine and rifampin (strong CYP3A4/5 inducer) led to an 
approximate 30% and 70% decrease in C max and AUC 0–∞, respectively, for valbenazine, and an 
approximate 50% and 80% decrease, respectively, for NBI-[ADDRESS_696567] of valbenazine on digoxin 
AUC 0–∞ was modest (1.4- fold increase) and the mean t ½ of digoxin was similar with and without 
valbenazine administration.  Midazolam C max and AUC 0–∞ were similar with and without 
valbenazine administration.  
Results from the completed 6 -week , placebo- controlled treatment period in the TD Phase 3 study 
(NBI-[ZIP_CODE]- 1304) indicated a statistically significant improvement in the Abnormal Involuntary 
Movement Scale (AIMS) dyskinesia total score mean change from baseline for valbenazine 80 mg compared with placebo. 
Valbenazine has been generally well tolerated in single doses up to 300  mg and in multiple doses 
of up to 100 mg.   During the TD 6- week , placebo -controlled period in 3 Phase 2 and 3 studies 
(NBI-[ZIP_CODE], -1202, and -1304), adverse reactions reported ≥3% and >placebo were  
somnolence ( somnolence, fatigue, and sedation; 10.9% valbenazine vs 4.2% placebo), 
anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, disturbance in attention, vision blurred, and 
urinary retention; 5.4% vs 4.9%), balance disorders /fall (fall, gait disturbance, dizziness, balance 
disorder; 4.1% vs 2.2%), and headache (3.4% vs 2.7%).  Other adverse reactions observed during premarketing evaluation of valbenazine (≥1% and >placebo), including long- term studies with 
up to 48 w eeks of treatment,  were blood glucose increased, weight increased, respi[INVESTIGATOR_58776], drooling, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal symptoms (non-akathisia), anxiety, and insomnia.   Overall, the incidence of adverse events ( AEs) leading to discontinuation during the 
TD 6 -week , placebo -controlled period in 3 Phase 2 and 3 studies was similar between 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-treated subjects (10 subjects, 4%) compared to those who received placebo (8 
subjects, 5%). 
Serious adverse events  (SAEs)  reported in >2 subjects across the clinical development program 
included schizophrenia (7 subjects); suicidal ideation (6  subjects); and schizoaffective disorder, 
abdominal pain, mental status change, syncope, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(3 su bjects each).  SAEs  considered possibly related to study drug were reported in 4 subjects: 
hepatitis acute, suicidal ideation, confusional state, and hypersensitivity; all in subjects taking valbenazine.  Valbenazine does not appear to increase suicidality .  Valbenazine may prolong the

expected with recommended dosing (40 and 80 mg).  A dose- related increase in prolactin,

6. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this clinical study are as follows:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the persistence of effect of valbenazine in subjects with TD who receive placebo in a double-blind, randomized withdrawal period following open- label treatment 
with valbenazine.  
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the relationship between subject clinical characteristics and persistence of 
effect of valbenazine during the double-blind, placebo-controll ed treatment period.  
• To evaluate the effect of valbenazine on measures of quality of life and disability when 
administered once daily for up to 16 weeks.  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of valbenazine administered once daily for up to [ADDRESS_696569] of valbenazine 40 mg and 80 mg.  Approximately 120 medically stable male and female subjects with clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with neuroleptic-induced TD or mood disorder with neuroleptic- induced TD will be enrolled.  
The study includes an initial open -label treatment period for 8 weeks, followed by a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period for 8 weeks, for a total of up to 16 weeks of treatment.  A final study visit will be conducted at Week 20 or upon early termination.   
Before subjects can provide informed consent, the investigator (or designee) must determine whether the subject has the capaci ty to provide consent for study participation using the 
University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC; Jeste et al., 2007).  Only subjects who are deemed to have the capacity to provide consent may

Clinical Study Protocol  Amendment No. [ADDRESS_696570] of any study-related procedures.  
Subjects will be screened for eligibility for up to 6 weeks prior to Day 1 (baseline visit).  
Eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study on Day 1.  Valbenazine will be self -administered 
(in the presence of the subject’s caregiver, i f applicable) beginning on Day 1; the subject will be 
directed to take their dose at about the same time each day.  During the open -label treatment 
period, subjects will receive [ADDRESS_696571] week followed by 80 mg for 7 weeks.   
At the end of Week 8, subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_696572] dose they received during the open- label treatment period.   Randomization will be stratified based on the use of 
concomitant antipsychotic medication; this will include up to 40 subjects who are not using antipsychotic medications (ie, have not used antipsychotic medication for at least [ADDRESS_696573] no plans for resuming antipsychotic treatment during the course of the study) and the remaining subjects will be using concomitant antipsychotic medications.  
At any time during treatment (open -label and placebo -controlled t reatment periods), subjects 
who are unable to tolerate the [ADDRESS_696574] their dose decreased to 40 mg (during the double-blind, placebo -controlled treatment period, this will be done in a blinded manner; 
subjects receiving placebo will continue to receive placebo).  Subjects who are unable to tolerate the [ADDRESS_696575], safety, health -related quality of life, disability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) 
will be assessed at scheduled times throughout t he study.  Visits during the open- label treatment 
period, the double-blind placebo- controlled treatment period, and the final study visit will have 
windows of ±6 days.

Clinical Study Protocol  Amendment No. 2 Final Version  Confidential 
14 May 2019  Page 25 9.2. Screening and Baseline Assessments  
9.2.1. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale  
The BPRS is a clinician -rated tool designed to assess the severity of psychopathology in patients 
with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (Overall and Gorham, 1962, 1988).  The BPRS 
includes [ADDRESS_696596], excitement, and disorientation.  
The severity of each of the 18 items of the BPRS is rated on a scale o f 1 (not present) to 7 
(extremely severe) (total score range:  18 to 126).  Higher scores represent greater symptom 
severity.  
The investigator or other qualified site personnel will administer and score the scale at screening,  
and subjects must have a BPRS  total score <50 to be eligible for study participation (see 
exclusion criterion # 4).  The  investigator or other qualified site personnel will also administer 
and score the scale on  Day 1, end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and the final study visit ( end of 
Week  20 or early termination ). 
9.2.2. Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
A blood sample will be collected from enrolled subjects for the analysis of CYP2D6 status (ie, normal, intermediate, poor, or ultrarapid metabolizers) on Day 1 .  Approximately 4 mL of blood 
will be collected in tubes containing dipotassium ethylenediaminet etraacetic acid (EDTA  K
2).  
After the sample is obtained, it should be thoroughly mixed.  The vials will be stoppered and labeled with the study barcode and subject number.  The collection and submission of medical information will be accomplished with str ict adherence to professional standards of 
confidentiality.  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_139532] a central laboratory for analysis. 
9.3. Persistence of Effect  
9.3.1. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale 
The severity of TD will be assessed using the AIMS rating scale.  This scale was developed by [CONTACT_11152] (Guy,  1976).  The AIMS rates a total of 10 items with 9 items rating involuntary movement from 
0 (no dyskinesia) t o 4 (severe dyskinesia).  Items 1 through 7 include facial and oral movements 
(Items  1 to 4), extremity movements (Items 5  to 6), and trunk movements (Item 7).  The AIMS 
dyskinesia total score for Items 1  to 7 ranges from 0 to 28; a higher score reflects i ncreased 
severity.  Items 8, [ADDRESS_696597]’s report of his/her awareness of abnormal movements from 0 (no awareness) to 4 (aware, severe distress).  Items 11 and 12 are yes/no questions concerning problems with teeth and/or 
dentures.

Clinical Study Protocol  Amendment No. 2 Final Version  Confidential 
14 May 2019  Page 26 The AIMS (with video recording) will be administered by [CONTACT_093] (or designee) at 
screening, Day 1 , end of Weeks 8, 12, 16, and at the final study visit ( end of Week 20 or early 
termination ).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. AIMS Administrator  
During the study, the AIMS will be administered at the study site by [CONTACT_093] (or 
designee) according to the AIMS administration procedure provided by [CONTACT_139559].  AIMS Items 11 to 12 will be completed by [CONTACT_093] (or designee) administering the AIMS; AIMS Items 8  to 10 will be scored by [CONTACT_093] (or designee) administering the AIMS .  If 
possible, the same person should administer the AIMS for an individual subject at all timepoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. AIMS Video Recording and External AIMS Review er 
Subjects will be video recorded for the duration of the AIMS administration (approximately 10 minutes) according to standardized guidelines provided by [CONTACT_11148] (or designee).  Video recordings of the AIMS administration will be uploaded to a secure, central AIMS serve r, 
managed by a core laboratory.  Access to the dedicated central AIMS server will be limited and will require the user to provide a user identification and password to access the secure server and the subject’s video recording.  The AIMS video recording uploaded to the server will be viewed by [CONTACT_535431]- designated representatives.  The External AIMS 
Reviewer will review the video recordings to  determine if the subject has moderate or severe TD 
at screening (see inclu sion criterion #6). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blinded, Central AIMS Video Raters  
The AIMS video recording files will be reviewed and scored by [CONTACT_11136], Central AIMS Video 
Raters.  A triple-blind consensus scoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_535432].  NBI (or designee) will provide the blin ded, Central AIMS Video 
Raters  a password- protected media (eg, flash drive)  containing the subjects’ randomized AIMS 
video recording files to review and score.  The central raters will be blinded to the subjects’ study visits and treatment assignments.  Tw o blinded, Central AIMS Video Raters  will together 
review each AIMS video file from beginning to end and must agree on the score (0 to 4) for AIMS Items [ADDRESS_696598] ed at Day 1, end of Weeks 8, 12, 16, and at the final study visit (end of 
Week 20 or early termination) .  
9.4. Health -Related Quality of Life and Disability Assessments  
9.4.1. EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels 
The EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ -5D-5L) is a general, sin gle index measure for 
describing and valuing health  (Herdman et al., 2011).  It defines health in terms of 5  dimensions:  
Mobility, Self -Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression.  Each 
dimension has 5 levels:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems , and 
extreme problems.  The subject indicates his/her health state by [CONTACT_535433].  The scores for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5 -digit 
number that describes the patient’s health state.  Subjects  also rate their overall health on a 0  to

Clinical Study Protocol  Amendment No. 2 Final Version  Confidential 
14 May 2019  Page 27 100 hash- marked, vertical visual analogue scale (EQ -VAS).  The endpoints are labeled ‘The best 
health you can imagine’ and ‘The worst health you can imagine.’ 
The EQ -5D-5L will be administered at Day 1 , end of Weeks 8, 16, and at the final visit ( end of 
Week  20 or early termination) .  
9.4.2. Sheehan Disa bility Scale  
The Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS) is a brief, validated measure of functional impairment in a 
number of psychiatric disorders to measure the effect of treatment on disability 
(Leon  et al., 1997).  It includes 3 self -rated items designed to measure how work, social life, and 
family life are impaired by [CONTACT_535434].  Each item includes an 11 -point analog 
scale that uses visual- spatial, numeric, and verbal descriptive anchors to represent the degree of 
disruption (0 [none at all] to 10 [extremely]).  It also assesses the number of days a subject was unable to work/attend school and the number of days a subject was underproductive in the past week.  
The SDS will be administered at Day 1 , end of Weeks 8, 16, and at the final visit ( end of 
Week  20 or early termination) . 
9.5. Plasma Drug Exposure  
Blood samples to evaluate plasma concentrations of valbenazine and the active metabolite NBI-[ZIP_CODE] (other metabolites may be evaluated) will be collected on Day 1 (predose), and at the 
end of Weeks 8, 12, and 16. 
For each sample, approximately 2  mL of blood will be collected in tubes containing EDTA K
2.  
The blood samples will be processed and sto red according to the procedure as specified in the 
laboratory manual.  Samples will be shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory for analysis.  
9.6. Safety Assessments  
Concomitant medication use and AEs will be monitored throughout the study as described in Section  9.9.1 and Section  11, respectively.  The remaining safety assessments are described in 
the following sections.  
For any abnormal safety assessment deemed clinically significant, the investigator will perform appropriate follow- up assessments (eg, repeat analysis), until the cause of the abnormality is 
determined and/or until the value returns to baseline (or within normal limits), or the investigator deems the abnormality to be of no clinical significance.  
Appropriate psychiatric evaluation and intervention will be provided for a ny treatment- emergent 
suicidal behavior or clinically significant suicidal ideation.  
9.6.1. Physical Examination, Including Height and Weight  
The complete physical examination will consist of an assessment of general appearance, skin and mucosae, head, eyes, ears , nose, throat, neck (including thyroid), lymph nodes, chest/lungs, 
cardiovascular, abdomen, extremities, musculoskeletal, and neurological system.  A complete physical examination including weight will be performed at screening, Day 1 , end of Weeks  4, 8,

Clinical Study Protocol  Amendment No. 2 Final Version  Confidential 
14 May 2019  Page 28 12, 16, and at the final visit ( end of Week 20 or early termination).  Height will be measured at 
screening only.  Height and weight will be measured with subjects not wearing shoes.  
9.6.2. Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital signs will include orthostatic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, orthostatic pulse rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (recorded only supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), and oral body temperature.  Blood pressure will be measured using a calibrated automatic blood pressure cuff after the subject has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes and after approximately 2 minutes of standing.  The automatic blood pressure cuff will also provide pulse rate measurement.  
Vital sign measurements will be collected at screening, Day 1, end of Weeks  4, 8, 12, 16, and at 
the final visit ( end of Week 20 or early termination).  Vital sign measurements will be obtained 
before any scheduled blood sample collection. 
9.6.3. Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12- lead ECG will be recorded in triplicate (at least 1 minute apart and within 
15 minutes) after the subject has rested supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes.  The ECG parameters that 
will be assessed include heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval , and QTcF (machine 
readings or calculated).   Additionally, the occurrence of de- and re- polarization and rhythm 
disorders or other abnormalities will be assessed.  Based on the review of these parameters, the 
investigator or designee will note if the ECG is Normal, Abnormal not Clinically Significan t, or 
Abnormal Clinically Significant.   If the ECG is Abnormal Clinically Significant, the investigator 
or designee will provide a description of the abnormality recorded on the AE eCRF. 
The 12- lead ECG recordings will be conducted at screening, Day 1, end of Weeks  4, 8, 12, 16, 
and at the final visit ( end of Week 20 or early termination) . 
9.6.4. Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
All clinical laboratory assessments will be performed by a central laboratory .  Results from 
samples collected at screening must be reviewed by [CONTACT_535435]’s eligibility.   In addition, certain laboratory assessments 
(alcohol breath test, UDS , and urine pregnancy test) will be performed by [CONTACT_535436] ( Day 1 ) to confirm subject eligibility.  The central laboratory  will provide instructions 
and supplies to the study staff before study initiation  and instructions will be included in a 
laboratory manual.   The laboratory test battery will include routine and screening laboratory 
tests.  
The routine laboratory tests (hematology and clinical chemistry) and urinalysis will be performed under non- fasted conditions at screening, Day 1, end of Weeks  4, 8, 12, 16, and at the final visit 
(end of Week  20 or early termination ).  Laboratory samples will be collected in the following 
approximate amounts:  3 mL for hematology, 1 mL for clinical chemistry (includes serum pregnancy tests), 3 mL for serology, and 4 mL for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Approximate total blood sample 
volume per subjec t is 43 mL ( including PK [2 mL per sample]).

The following additional laboratory tests will be performed:  
Serology :  Blood will be collected for HIV -Ab, HBsAg, and HCV -Ab testing at screening.   
Urine Drug Screen and Alcohol Breath Test :  The UDS  will test for amphetamines, 
methamphetamine, barbiturates, phencyclidine, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cannabinoids, cocaine, 
methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858].   A UDS  will be performed at screening by a 
certified central laboratory.  A UDS  will be conducted at the clinical site at Day [ADDRESS_696599] will be performed at screening  and at Day 1. 
Pregnancy Tests :  Pregnancy tests will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing 
potential.  A serum pregnancy test (β-hCG) will be performed at screening.  A urine pregnancy 
test will be performed at the clinical site on Day 1  (a negative test result is required to be eligible 
for the study) and at the end of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and at the final visit ( end of Week  20 or early 
termination) .  
9.6.5. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS is a validated instrument to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior 
(http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu).  There are versions of the questionnaire designed for use at screening (Baseline/Screening version) and at baseline and visits throughout the study (Since Last Visit version).  All versions of the C-SSRS include a series of screening questions related to 
suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior.  Subject responses of “yes” to 1 or more screening 
questions will prompt additional questions that evaluate frequency and intensity of suici dal 
ideation and/or behavior.  Subjects with any lifetime suicidal behavior  within 3 months prior to 
screening will be excluded.  In addition, subjects with  suicidal ideation of type 4 (active suicidal

All subjects prematurely disconti nuing the study, regardless of cause, should be encouraged have 
all early termination assessments performed, if possible (see Section  9.7.3 ). 
9.10.1. Handlin g of Withdrawals 
If a subject prematurely withdraws from the study, either at his/her request, or at the 
investigator’s discretion, the investigator will record the reason for withdrawal on the relevant eCRF.  All subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely should hav e all early termination 
assessments performed.  
It is crucial to obtain follow -up data for any subject withdrawn because of an AE, abnormal 
laboratory test, vital sign measurement, physical examination, or ECG finding.  In any case, every effort must be mad e to undertake safety follow-up procedures. 
9.10.2. Sponsor’s Termination of Study 
NBI reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons.  Such a termination must be implemented by [CONTACT_093], if instructed to do so by [CONTACT_263835] a

10.7. Study Drug Return 
Written documentation to account for study drug and study drug materials is mandatory; all unus ed study drug and study drug materials must be kept in a secure location for final 
accountability and reconciliation.  Returned study drug and study drug material must be accounted for on a study drug return form provided by [CONTACT_139559].  The investigator must provide a written explanation for any destroyed or missing study drug or study drug materials.  
Returns will be shipped to NBI or its designee at the completion of the study according to instructions provided by [CONTACT_11173].  Study drug return forms must be completed for the shipment of returns and sent with the study drug and study drug materials.  One copy of the study drug return form will be retained in the investigator’s study file.  
All returned study drug and study drug materials should be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and returned according to applicable state and federal regulations and study procedures.  
11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
All AEs, whether observed by [CONTACT_093], reported by [CONTACT_423], noted from laboratory findings, or identified by [CONTACT_11174], will be recorded from the time the subject signed the ICF until the subject’s final study visit ( end of Week 20 or early termination).  
11.1. Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or dise ase temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
AEs include, but are not limited to:  (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency of conditions present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; and (4) drug interaction.  
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptom.  The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether  believed by [CONTACT_316510], must be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the AE eCRF.  Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, outcome, other actions taken, and relationship to the study drug.  
Neurocrine Biosciences , Inc., Study No. NBI -[ZIP_CODE]-TD4002 
Clinical Study Protocol  Amendment No. [ADDRESS_696612]’s response to the suicidal ideation section of the C -SSRS 
is worse than the baseline assessment, it will be documented as an AE.  All suicidal behaviors 
will be documented as an AE.  
The following are not considered AEs:  
• Continuous persistent disease/symptom present before drug administration, unless it unexpectedly progresses, or increases in severity following drug a dministration.  
• Pregnancy. 
11.2. Intensity of Adverse Events  
AEs must be graded for intensity.  An intensity category of mild, moderate, or severe, as defined in Table 2, must be entered on the AE eCRF.  It should be noted that the term “severe” used to grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious.”  
Table 2: Intensity of Adverse Events 
Grade  Intensity  
Mild  An AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate An AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention.  The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant.  
Severe  An AE that interru pts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or 
may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
11.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator will document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_316492] 3.  An AE is deemed associated with the use of the 
study drug “if there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE” (otherwise referred to as a suspected adverse reaction).  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relations hip between the drug and the AE (Title 21 CFR 312.32 [a]).

Clinical Study Protocol  Amendment No. 2 Final Version  Confidential 
14 May 2019  Page 40 Table 3: Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
Relationship  Description  
Definite  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administr ation of the drug or in 
which the drug level has been established in body fluids or tissue; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_45452][INVESTIGATOR_11125], and re appearance of the reaction on repeated 
exposure.  
Possible  An adverse event in which there is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
Unlikely  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or suspected response pattern to the suspected drug; but that could reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_535437] o f the subject’s clinical state.  
Not Related  Any event that does not meet the above criteria.  
11.4. Recording Adverse Events  
For enrolled subjects, each AE will be listed as a separate entry on an AE eCRF.  Screen failure 
subjects will have AE information noted  in the source documentation.  The investigator (or 
designee) will provide information on dates and times of onset and resolution, intensity, seriousness, frequency, action(s) taken, changes in study drug usage, relationship to study drug, and outcome. 
The following categories of medical events that could occur during participation in a clinical 
study must be reported within 24 hours to NBI or its designee: 
• SAE, including death ( refer to Section  11.6). 
• Pregnancy (refer to Section  11.7). 
• Events of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent) based on the C -SSRS.  
11.5. Post-Study Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
All AEs, including clinically significant changes in ECGs, physical examination findings, or isolated clinically significant laboratory findings must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  If 
resolved, a resolution date should be documented on the eCRF.   
AEs ongoing at the final study visit ( end of Week 20 or early termination ) will be followed for as 
long as necessary to adequately evaluate the subject’s safety or until the event stabilizes or 
resolves or until the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that 
follow- up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature 
and/or causality of the AE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals, as is practical.

11.6.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death.  
• A life-threatening  AE.  Life threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the 
investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does 
not mean that hypothetically the event might have caused death if it occurred in a more serious form. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139538] a preexisting condition that did not worsen during the clinical investigation is n ot considered an AE.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316493].  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084], and if a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is considered serious.  Treatment in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11128] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  These events may be considered serious when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the health of the subject and may require medical or surgical interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  Any other event thought by 
[CONTACT_11177], following the reporting requirements detailed in this section.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
11.6.2. Managing Serious Adverse Events  
Subjects experiencing an SAE or an emergency situation will be examined by a physician as 
soon as possible.  The physician in attendance will do whatever is medically needed for the safety and well -being of the subject.  The subject will remain under observation as long as 
medically indicated.  Appropriate laboratory studies will be conducted until all parameters return to normal or are otherwise explained or stable.  The subject will be followed until the SAE resolves or until the subject is medically stabilized.  The investigator (or designee) will notify the NBI Medical Monitor (and the IRB, if necessary) immediately (within 24 hours) of the SAE and the outcome of the SAE.  
If within the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_696614] be documented and reported as described in Section  11.6.3.

Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE unless the criteria for an SAE are met.  However, all pregnancies in female subjects who received valbenazine will be followed to assess for congenital anomaly.  Subjects must be counseled at all visits to continue using contraception (see inclusion criterion # 2) until [ADDRESS_696616] be immediately reported 
to NBI (refer to Section  11.6.[ADDRESS_696617] information), followed by [CONTACT_535440] .  A first trimester ultrasound will be requested  for all confirmed 
pregnancies.  Pregnancies in subjects who received valbenazine will be followed until resolution (ie, termination [voluntary or spontaneous] or birth).

12.1. Case Report Form  
The case report form (CRF) data for this study are being collected with an electronic data capture 
(EDC) system (Rave®) provided by [CONTACT_263840], NY, [LOCATION_003].  The EDC 
system and the study -specific eCRFs will comply with Title [ADDRESS_696618] data in his/her own subject files.  These subject files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by [CONTACT_263841], with the exception of data captured in an electronic format, which will be loaded electronically into the appropriate eCRFs.  All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by [CONTACT_26300].  The eCRF for each subject must be reviewed by [CONTACT_263842](s).  This should be done as soon as possible afte r the subject completes the study.   
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff will make any necessary additions/corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date, person performing the corrections, and reason for the change will be available via the electronic audit trail, which is part of the EDC system.  The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by [CONTACT_11148] (or designee).  NBI will also be allowed access to all source documents and medical records pertinent to the study in order to verify eCRF 
entries.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_263808].  
Medidata will provide access to the NBI portal of the EDC system for the duration of the study 
through a password- protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from 
investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from th e EDC system 
will be archived on appropriate data media (CD -ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at 
that time as a durable record of the site’s eCRF data.  Although not required, the investigator may make paper printouts from that media.  
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to GCP regulations.  This includes an 
inspection by [CONTACT_11185]/or health authority representatives at any time.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11131] -related records by [CONTACT_41797]/or 
NBI.  
12.2. Data Capture, Review, and Validation  
Data entered in the EDC system will be verified against the source data by [CONTACT_11148] (or designee).  Any discrepancies will be corrected on -line by [CONTACT_1747].  After completion of 
the entry process, automated (computer -generated) logic checks will run in order to identify 
items such as inconsistent study dates.  In addition, manual review/checks may be performed by [CONTACT_11188].  Any inconsistencies/errors/omissions identified will be sent to the site (via an electronic query) for the necessary corrections to be made to the eCRF.  Once entered and saved in an eCRF, data immediately become part of the study database and are available to NBI.

13. STATIST ICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLAN  
Descriptive statistics and graphical methods will be used to summarize the data from this study.  The term “descriptive statistics” refers to the number of subjects (n), mean, median, SD, SEM, minimum, and maximum for continuous and ordinal categorical variables; and refers to the number and percentage of subjects for categorical variables.  Two -sided 95% confidence 
intervals will be presented for selected variables.  
The analysis plan provided in this protocol represents a brief description of the planned analyses.  The comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be generated prior to final study database lock and unblinding of the treatment group assignments.  The SAP may include a number of 
additional analyses and data summaries not described in this protocol. 
13.1. Analysis Sets  
Analysis sets will be defined in the SAP.  
13.2. Sample Size  
Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled in this study.  The 1:1 randomization to placebo or valbenazine during the double-blind, placebo- controlled  treatment period will therefore provide a 
sample size of approximately 60 subjects in the placebo arm.  The SD for the AIMS dyskinesia total score change from the end of the open -label treatment period ( end of Week 8) to visits 
during the double-blind, pl acebo -controlled treatment period in the placebo treatment arm is 
estimated to be 4.0 based on results from the previously reported Phase 3 study NBI-[ZIP_CODE].  With this SD and a sample size of 60, the overall width of a two-sided 95% 
confidence interva l for the AIMS dyskinesia total score mean change will be approximately 2.0.  
The width of the confidence interval will increase to approximately 2.2 if the placebo treatment arm sample size is 50 and to approximately 2.5 if the sample size is 40.  
13.3. Handling  of Missing Data 
In general, all available study data will be included in relevant summaries and data displays, including any available data for subjects with incomplete or missing data.  Specific rules for handling missing data values (including any imputation rules) will be identified in the SAP  if 
warranted .  
13.4. Disposition of Subjects  
A summary of subject disposition will be prepared that displays the number of subjects who were enrolled, who were randomized at the Week 8 visit, who completed the double -blind, 
placebo -controlled treatment period, and who completed the final scheduled study visit.  The

14 May 2019  Page 45 number of subjects who discontinued early from the study will be displayed by [CONTACT_535441]. 
13.5. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data and baseline characteristics  will be summarized with descriptive statistics or 
frequency tables as appropriate.  Medical history will also be summarized . 
13.6. Study Drug Dosing and Compliance  
The number and percentage of subjects who are dose compliant (at least 80% of expected number of doses taken) will be summarized with descriptive statistics.   
The number and percentage of subjects with  a dose reduction will be summarized.  
13.7. Persistence of E ffect 
Persistence of effect after randomization to either placebo or valbenazine will be based primarily on the mean changes from the randomization visit ( end of Week 8) in the AIMS dyskinesia total 
score to visits during the double-blind, placebo-controll ed treatment period.  Descriptive 
statistics, including two -sided 95% confidence intervals for the mean, will be calculated for the 
changes from the end of Week  [ADDRESS_696619] clinical characteristics (including psychiatric diagnosis, age, gender, concomitant use of antipsychotic medications, and other parameters) and the persistence of effect of valbenazine during the double-blind, placebo- controlled treatment period will be 
evaluated using descriptive statistics and graphical methods.  
13.8. Health -Related Quality of Life and Disability Data  
The health -related quality of life and disability measures in this study are the EQ-5D-5L and the 
SDS, respectively.  Descriptive statistics will be presented for each of these measures by [CONTACT_765] . 
13.9. Plasma Drug Exposure  
The plasma concentrations of valbenazine and the metabolite NBI -[ZIP_CODE] (other metabolites may 
be evaluated) will be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_535442].  
Concentrations below the lower limit of quantification will be set equal to zero for all plasma concentration summaries.  
13.10.  Safety Data  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), categorized by [CONTACT_11189] 
(SOC) and/or preferred term (PT) will be summarized in frequency tables.  The TEAE summary 
tables will include the number and percentage of subjects experiencing each event.  
TEAEs reported during the open- label treatment period will be summarized separately from 
TEAEs reported during the double-blind, placebo -controlled treatment period.  Summary tables   
Neurocrine Biosciences , Inc., Study No. NBI -[ZIP_CODE]-TD4002

definitely related to study drug (for the open- label treatment period only), and TEAEs according 
to maximum  intensity.   
Additional summaries will be presented for TEAEs leading to study drug dose reduction, early discontinuation from the study, SAEs, and deaths. 
Clinical laboratory, vital signs, ECG, C -SSRS, and BPRS data will be summarized by [CONTACT_535443].  Potentially clinically significant (PCS) values for selected clinical 
laboratory and vital signs variables will be summarized.  
13.11.  Software 
Statistical calculations and summaries will be generated using SAS software version 9. [ADDRESS_696620] agree to the inspection of study -related 
records by [CONTACT_535444]/or NBI or its designee.  
14.2. Institutional Review Board  
The final approved protocol and the ICF will be reviewed by [CONTACT_11198].  The committee’s decision concerning conduct of the study will be sent in writing to the investigator and a copy will be forwarded to NBI.  The investigator must agree to make any required progress reports to the IRB, as well as reports of SAEs, life-threatening problems, or death.  
14.3. Protocol Adherence and Amendments  
The protocol must be read thoroughly, and the instructions must be followed exactly.  Any 
changes in the protocol will require a formal amendment.  Such amendments will be agreed upon and approved in writing by [CONTACT_139569].  The IRB will be notified of al l 
amendments to the protocol.  Amendments to the protocol will not be implemented until written IRB approval has been received.

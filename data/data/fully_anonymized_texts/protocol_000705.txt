developments in cascade modeling and network physiology.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND
2. Purpose of the Study 
Version 4 - PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page 5 of 33
IRB PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page 6 of 33
What are the specific scientific objectives of the research?
This project aims to investigate how multiplicative interactions among movement-system
components support suprapostural dexterity. The project integrates a customizable Trail
Making Test (TMT) with posturography, whole-body movement tracking, and eye tracking,
along with state-of-the-art cascade modeling and network analysis methods to assess
functional coordination across the whole body. The project has two specific aims: (1) to
investigate how multiplicative interactions among movement-system components support
suprapostural dexterity, and (2) to investigate how multiplicative interactions among
movement-system components support suprapostural dexterity in the face of postural
instability. The project hypothesizes that maintaining an upright stance and participating in
the Trail Making Test would produce modular networks of multiplicative interactions among
movement-system components, and that destabilizing contact [CONTACT_799998].
3. Background and Rationale 
Describe the background of the study. Include a critical evaluation of existing
knowledge, and specifically identify the information gaps that the project is intended to
fill.
Dexterity is global, functional coordination spanning the whole body (Bernstein, 1967; Chiel
and Beer, 1997; Profeta and Turvey, 2018; Turvey, 2007, 1990; Turvey and Fonseca,
2014), but movement science risks taking a fractured approach to investigate how dexterity
is supported. Diagnoses of movement disorders are on the rise in the [LOCATION_002], the
most common being due to stroke (Tsao et al., 2022; Yousufuddin and Young, 2019) and
Parkinsons disease (Jankovic, 2009; Steeves et al., 2012). Prevailing understandings of
these disorders characterize broken movements in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_125649], for instance,
focusing on motor control, muscle tone, posture, or cognition independently of each other.
Likewise, rehabilitative interventions target the limb or body parts most affected by [CONTACT_799999]. However, this
perspective can be blind to the body's functional integrity. Functionality can override
anatomical separability, which is rarely more evident than in suprapostural dexterity when
the body must complete a task while maintaining an upright stance. On the prospective path
towards a goal, whatever begins at one or more anatomical locations can quickly spread
through the whole body, destabilizing the body on the way to task completion. Indeed, the
compromised coordination between task engagement and postural instability accentuates
the risk of falling in pathological populations (Barr et al., 2017; Canning et al., 2014; Ekbom
and Ulfberg, 2009; Fasano et al., 2017; Rascol et al., 2015). In other words, task completion
draws on fundamental interactivity allowing the body to coordinate various anatomical parts.
This coordination may be more vital to healthy movement than individual anatomical parts.
Understanding this interactivity is thus paramount to developi[INVESTIGATOR_799986] 4 - PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page 6 of 33
IRB PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page [ADDRESS_1103850], movement science has established that postural
stability requires a modular structure of functional networks shaped by [CONTACT_800000] (Boonstra et al., 2019, 2016, 2015; Esteve-Altava
et al., 2015; Kerkman et al., 2020, 2018; Murphy et al., 2018). This arrangement indicates a
soft assembly and disassembly of functional modules as an individual engages in a task and
responds to changing task demands, respectively. Second, movement science has yet to
grapple with the multiplicative interactions among movement-system components producing
highly complex and unpredictable behaviors beyond the scope of dominant linear modeling
approaches (Kelty-Stephen et al., 2013, 2022; Kelty-Stephen and Mangalam, 2022a;
Mangalam and Kelty-Stephen, 2022). Accordingly, the scientific premises for this proposal
are that the dominant network approaches to dexterity are linear, and network approaches
can give voice to the nonlinearity we all know is there.
The prevailing dogmatic views on dexterity take a fractured approach to investigating how
dexterity is supported, often focusing on motor control, muscle tone, posture, or cognition
independently of each other. However, dexterity is global, functional coordination spanning
the whole body (Bernstein, 1967; Chiel and Beer, 1997; Profeta and Turvey, 2018; Turvey,
2007, 1990; Turvey and Fonseca, 2014). For instance, postural fluctuations produce
translations and rotations of visible surfaces specific to the objects spatial relationships in
the visual field. These movement-induced translations and rotations compose an optic flow
that provides visual support for the subsequent movement. Thus, subtle sway offers the
sighted organism a rich source of information about objects layouts in the visual field. The
visual layout then presses the postural system into a poise for engaging with objects and
events (Mangalam et al., 2021). Hence, functionality overrides anatomical separability when
the body must complete a task while maintaining an upright stance.
A series of recent studies have modeled postural stability as a modular structure of
functional networks shaped by [CONTACT_800001]
(Boonstra et al., 2016, 2015; Esteve-Altava et al., 2015; Kerkman et al., 2020, 2018; Murphy
et al., 2018). This arrangement indicates a soft assembly and disassembly of functional
modules as an individual engages in a task and responds to changing task demands,
respectively. However, critically, movement science follows the prevailing tradition in
network approaches of preserving spatial or structural information while collapsing across
time (Bartsch et al., 2015; Bashan et al., 2012; Gosak et al., 2022; Ivanov et al., 2016; Rizzo
et al., 2020). Collapsing variability across time leads to the lack of generalizability of results
because variability is not the same across space and time. In contrast, cascades carry
information about uncollapsed time, the texture, and the variation that dexterous posture will
Version 4 - PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page 7 of 33
IRB PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page [ADDRESS_1103851] as the body coordinates longer timescale factors like intention for task completion with
shorter-timescale factors like perturbations and corrective movements. Cascade modeling
allows us to articulate how seemingly differentiated forms can arise from fluid interactions of
the movement-system components across many timescales (Kelty-Stephen et al., 2022,
2013; Kelty-Stephen and Mangalam, 2022b). Cascades operate through the loose nesting
of finer motoric details within larger motoric degrees of freedom (e.g., motor neurons within
bundles of muscle fiber, muscles within joint-centered synergies, and so on) that allow
dexterous behavior to adapt flexibly to constraints changing on the way to task completion.
We have previously shown this capacity for cascades to knit events across many timescales
is similar in postural sway, no matter whether we load the upper body (Furmanek et al.,
2020; Kelty-Stephen et al., 2020), destabilize contact [CONTACT_800002] (Kelty-
Stephen, 2018; Mangalam and Kelty-Stephen, 2021), or increase visual effort (Mangalam et
al., 2021). However, treatment could be tailored and targeted if we know what specific
network structures support suprapostural dexterity and how these networks assemble and
dissemble.
A significant challenge of standard linear network models has been the discontinuity
between one functional module and the next. The precision of cascade-driven network
modeling will allow us to understand suprapostural dexterity without switching between
different control modes. Cascade modeling allows us to articulate how seemingly
differentiated forms can arise from similar fluid interactions across many timescales (Kelty-
Stephen et al., 2022, 2013; Kelty-Stephen and Mangalam, 2022b). This capacity for
cascades to extend across timescales appears similarly in postural sway, no matter whether
we load the upper body (Furmanek et al., 2020; Kelty-Stephen et al., 2020), destabilize
contact [CONTACT_800002] (Kelty-Stephen, 2018; Mangalam and Kelty-Stephen, 2021),
or increase visual effort (Mangalam et al., 2021). Indeed, network modeling of cascade-like
interactivity may reflect control parameters governing bodily coordination across the
timescales of the fastest reflex to the slowest movement unfolding across the entire task.
This modeling framework offers a new way to understand suprapostural dexterity in light of
recent theoretical developments in cascade modeling and network physiology.
We will use network modeling of cascade-like interactivity as a fresh way to understand
suprapostural dexterity in light of recent theoretical developments in cascade modeling and
network physiology. The precision of cascade-driven network modeling will allow us to
understand suprapostural dexterity without implying any discontinuity between one
functional module and the next. Healthy adults will maintain an upright stance on a stable
surface in one condition and perform the Trail Making Test while maintaining an upright
stance in the other. We hypothesize that maintaining an upright stance would produce a
functional network of multiplicative interactions among movement-system components
(Hypothesis 1.1). The Trail Making Task has been shown to measure several capabilities
Version 4 - PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page 8 of 33
IRB PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page 9 of 33
such as cognitive flexibility, alternating attention, sequencing, visual search, and motor
speed, among other functions (Bowie and Harvey, 2006; Reitan, 1958; Sanchez-Cubillo et
al., 2009). Performing the Train Making Task must introduce longer-timescale constraints on
the postural system already satisfying the shorter-timescale demands of postural stability. It
is expected that the culmination of shorter-timescale postural constraints and longer-
timescale constraints imposed by [CONTACT_800003]. Accordingly, we hypothesize that taking part in
the Trail Making Test would produce a succession of distinct, modular networks of
multiplicative interactions among movement-system components (Hypothesis 1.2).
Aim [ADDRESS_1103852] that performing two tasks
simultaneously or in close succession relies on the flexible reconfiguration of the brain
networks (Alavash et al., 2015; Ekman et al., 2012; Hilgetag et al., 2001; Lam and Shin,
1998). Indeed, performance in different concurrent tasks benefits from unique functional
brain networks at various timescales: integration of local, intermediate, or global networks
(Alavash et al., 2015). Furthermore, the inability of the brain networks to sustain two
separate topological configurations at once, each supporting the performance in one of the
dual-task components, causes moment-to-moment fluctuations in the dual-task behavior
(Alavash et al., 2016). Accordingly, we will examine the extent of modularity and the
strength of connectivity between modular networks on multiplicative interactions as part of
Aim 2.
Aim [ADDRESS_1103853] with the ground surface when maintaining an upright stance will
produce modular networks of multiplicative interactions with increased connectivity among
these modules compared to stable standing (Hypothesis 2.1). We hypothesize that
destabilizing contact [CONTACT_800004] a succession of distinct, modular networks of multiplicative interactions with
increased connectivity among these modules compared to stable standing (Hypothesis 2.2).

achieve the scientific objectives of the research?
50 healthy adults; 25 men and 25 women
2. What is the statistical or other justification for the total number of subjects described
above?
Sample size determination was made based on previously observed values of statistical
descriptors of movement variability in older and younger adults (older: H = 0.64±0.08;
younger: 0.76±0.07 (Hunt et al., 2014; Kaipust et al., 2013; Raffalt et al., 2021; Vaz et al.,
2019; Vaz et al., 2020) and the procedure outlined in Kuznetsov and Rhea (2017). The
method entails generating simulated datasets with known parameters. Power Analysis
conducted across 1000 simulated datasets revealed that 16 participants per group will yield
86%, 94%, and 100% power to detect a difference of 0.1, 0.05, and 0.3 in H for fixed effects

19 to 35 years old healthy young adults will participate (a separate study will be planned to
include middle age and older adults). Since the proposed project has a within-subjects
design, each participant will be subjected to each experimental condition.
2. What is the rationale for selecting this age range?
Our choice of 19 to 35 years old participants is based on two reasons: (i) the movement
system starts to show slowing and deterioration in most adults as they reach 40 years of
age; and (ii) we plan a future study with comparisons to middle-aged and older adults to
study how the movement system deteriorates with age.

Tasks, procedure, and instructions to the participant
Participants will be tested in an indoor laboratory in the Biomechanics Research Building at
the University of Nebraska at Omaha. After taking informed consent, participants will be
fitted with retroreflective markers and an eye tracker (see below). In Aim 1, participants will
maintain an upright stance on a stable surface a pair of force plates in one condition and
perform the Trail Making Test while maintaining an upright stance in the other. The Trail
Making Task will be presented on a projector screen and involve drawing a trail through
jumbled numbers. In Aim 2, participants will maintain an upright stance on an unstable
Version 4 - PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page 13 of 33
IRB PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page [ADDRESS_1103856] as show in the attached pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103].
Posturography
Participants will stand on dual 40×60 cm floor-embedded force plates (400600HPS, AMTI
Inc., Watertown, MA) with one foot on each force plate. Participants will be given no
additional instructions that can impose artificial constraints on the posture. Ground reaction
forces will be recorded at 200 Hz.
Motion tracking
Participants will be outfitted with a form-fitting compression suit, lab-provided athletic shoes
in their size, and a full-body, 79-marker retroreflective marker set before the study. Marker
trajectories in 3D will be collected at 200 Hz using a 17-camera motion capture system
(Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA). An RGB camera will record the laser
pointer traces on the projector screen. A wireless receiver will be connected to the motion
capture system to track eye movements in synchrony with the kinematic data.
Combining eye tracking and motion capture
Participants will wear an eye tracker (100 Hz, Glasses 2, Tobii, Stockholm, Sweden). Before
data collection, participants will look at a calibration matrix projected on the screen with
calibration marks at known locations. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_799987]. At each subsequent frame, gaze data will be translated and rotated according to
the motion capture system's 6-DoF measurements of head position. Eye tracking will
provide a rich resource for pi[INVESTIGATOR_799988].
Primarily it would allow us to make better contact [CONTACT_800005]. Secondarily, it would inform subsequent experimental
designs; for example, we might experimentally manipulate the distance between visual
targets within or beyond the comfortable, self-selected ranges.

B. Are all of the procedures, interventions, evaluations and tests being performed

C. Describe briefly the statistical methods used to analyze the data (or reference the
appropriate section of the detailed protocol or grant).
Pre-processing of posturography and motion-tracking data
Center of Pressure (CoP) planar Euclidean displacement (PED) series: The ground reaction
forces recorded from the two force plates will be combined to yield a 2D CoP series,
describing the CoP position along the participants anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes.
A 1D CoP PED series will be obtained for each 3D CoP series, describing CoP
displacement along the body's transverse plane. Center of Mass (CoM) spatial Euclidean
displacement (SED) series: The bodily CoMs position will be estimated by [CONTACT_800006], trunk, pelvis, left and right hand, forearm, upper arm, thigh,
shank, and foot to the equations from Zatsiorsky and Seluyanov (Zatsiorsky and Seluyanov,
1985), yielding a 3D series describing CoM position along the participants anterior-posterior,
medial-lateral, and superior-inferior axes. A 1D CoM SED series will be obtained for each
CoM series, describing CoM displacement in 3D. Marker SED series: Motion tracking of
each reflective marker will yield a 3D series describing its position along the participants
medial-lateral, anterior-posterior, and superior-inferior axes. A one-dimensional SED series
will be obtained for each marker, describing the displacement of that marker in 3D.
Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_799989] L and R eyes' gaze data will be independently recorded, and for analytical purposes,
we will compute the average gaze location between the two eyes for each time point. The
transformation of all gaze data will make it relative to the screen. The X and Y coordinates
of the gaze position, the timestamp, and the matching world-camera video frame number
will be included for each sample in the eye-tracking data file (normalized w.r.t. the world-
camera frame dimensions).
Assessing multifractality due to nonlinearity
Multifractality refers to blending processes across different timescales, producing emergent
structures. Multifractal spectrum width will be estimated using Chhabra and Jensens (1989)
direct method. A non-zero width will indicate interactions in component processes producing
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_799990], such as small and large changes in fluctuations. To
identify whether a nonzero width reflects multifractality due to nonlinearity, the multifractal
spectral width for the original series will be compared to those for 32 Iterated Amplitude
Adjusted Fourier Transform (IAAFT) surrogates (Ihlen, 2012; Schreiber and Schmitz, 1996).
IAAFT randomizes original values time-symmetrically around the autoregressive structure,
generating surrogates that randomize phase ordering of the original series spectral
Version 4 - PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page 15 of 33
IRB PROTOCOL # 0055-23-EP   Page [ADDRESS_1103857] error of the spectrum width for the 32
surrogates. The greater the value of the t-statistic, the greater the multifractality in the
original series due to nonlinear as opposed to linear sources.
Network modeling of multiplicative interactions
Vector autoregression (VAR) analysis will be used to model multiplicative interactions
across the CoP, CoM, and 79 markers, represented in the model as (CoP, CoM, M1, M2, ,,,,
M79). VAR captures interdependencies amongst concurrent series and will model the
effects of t-statistic across anatomical locations in subsequent segments. VAR will yield a
temporal trajectory of weights for each combination, defining a directional weighted
musculoskeletal network for each participant and task condition. These functional networks
will be transformed into binary networks to compare with the anatomical network.
Thresholding the weightsusing a single, unique threshold value corresponding to the
percolation threshold (Esfahlani and Sayama, 2018)will yield a minimally connected network
across task conditions. In this sparse network, each node will be connected to at least one
node by [CONTACT_800007].
Statistical analysis
A full-factorial regression model will test the impulses and responses of each marker
position. Impulse and Response will serve as class variables indicating the locations of
impulse and response variables. Statistical significance will be interpreted as evidence of
the flow of nonlinearities in movement fluctuations between the corresponding pair of
anatomical locations, with the flow direction from the Impulse variable to the Response
variable. Statistical significance will be set at a Type I error rate of 5%.
Extraction of functional musculoskeletal modules
The Louvain algorithm will extract functional musculoskeletal modules from the entire
network. Consensus clustering will be implemented to achieve a stable
partition(Lancichinetti and Fortunato, 2012). Multiplex modularity analysis will identify the
functional musculoskeletal modules across different task conditions---MolTi software
(https://github.com/gilles-didier/MolTi) will be utilized to identify functional musculoskeletal
modules within multiplex networks by [CONTACT_800008].
Comparison of functional musculoskeletal networks across task conditions
The networks will be coarse-grained to compare functional musculoskeletal networks across
task conditions (Kujala et al., 2016). The functional modules estimated across task
conditions will coarse-grain the binary networks and then compare the strength of the inter-

represent modules, and the edges signify the relationships between modules.

RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
16. Potential Risks 
What are the potential risks associated with each research procedure, intervention,
evaluation and/or test? If data are available, estimate the probability that a given harm
may occur and its potential reversibility.
The potential risks of standing are similar to general bouts of light physical activity, the most
likely one being fatigue due to extended standing. The trials in which participants will be
asked to maintain balance on a balance board run the risk of losing balance. Balancing on
the balance board might pose additional risk of loosing balance and falling. We will cover all
surface adjacent to the participant with thick styrofoam to prevent injury in the unlikely case
of fall.
17. Risk Classification 
What is the overall risk classification of the research?
♦ Minimal risk
Greater than minimal risk 
18. Minimization of Risk 
A. Describe how the subjects of the research will be monitored by [CONTACT_109302].

C. Describe the auditing plan for research conducted. Identify who will conduct the
audits and specify the audit frequency.
The primary investigator will be in charge of auditing the research (every 2 months) if
discrepancies are found between the data collection, analysis, or logging procedures.
D. Describe the specific subject withdrawal criteria.
Participants will be asked throughout the data collection period if they are experiencing any
physical discomfort and will be withdrawn from the study if stated that they do experience
any physical discomfort. If the subject appears to be off balance or unsteady, they will be
withdrawn from the study. Participants only need to express this to an investigator if they
desire to withdraw. Suppose any aspect of the research negatively impacts their health or
they no longer fit the eligibility criteria at any point in the research. In that case, the
participant will be taken off the study. The study does not have any treatment or intervention
beyond minimal physical activity. Therefore there is no consequence to the participant for
withdrawing from the protocol
E. Describe the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_109263] (e.g., the specific criteria for halting or
early termination of the study).
The data collection sessions will be halted for reasons including, but not limited to: injury of
any kind during data collection, equipment malfunction that may put the participants in
increased harm, signs of physical injury, or expression of physical discomfort. We do not
expect participants falling to be common during this project. However, if any participants fall,
the study session will be terminated.

minutes, participants will be compensated for three hours. Participants will be compensated
even if the study session is terminated prior to completion. Prorated compensation will be
made regardless of whether withdrawal was voluntary (the participant decides to withdraw
from the study) or involuntary (based on withdrawal criteria of the research protocol.)
At the end of the study session, using a laboratory computer, the participant will fill out and
sign an online form with their payment details such as name, address, SSN, and citizenship
status. None of these things will be recorded by [CONTACT_3021]. The form will then be sent
to
the researcher to enter the amount the participant is to be paid and the cost center number
for the grant the payment is to come from and submit for departmental approval. Once this
is complete it will be sent to the accounting department of UNO for processing. A check will
be sent to the participant at the address written on the form.

COVID-19
Human Subjects Research Safety Plan 
For studies involving face-to-face encounters, the research team under the
responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_799996]:
1.Masking of the researcher(s) during a face-to-face encounter
2.Cleansing of any surface and/or equipment utilized before and after a subject
encounter
3.The Biosafety Officer ([EMAIL_15227]) will be notified if obtaining
saliva, nasal, sputum or stools samples to ensure safe collection, handling, and
processing plan is in place
4.Suggest addressing the current health of the subject before commencing face-
to-face research via questions below:
Have you or anyone in your household tested positive or had a fever,
chills, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, recent
loss of taste or smell, tiredness or fatigue, or muscle aches? If yes, the
monitor will not be allowed on campus.
Have you recently traveled to an area with a widespread outbreak or had
close contact [CONTACT_4490] a person known to have COVID-19, MERs-CoV or
Ebola?
Have you traveled outside of the country within the past month? If so,
where did you travel and when did you return?

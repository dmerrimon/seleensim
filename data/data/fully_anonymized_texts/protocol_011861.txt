Two subgroups of equal size will be included in the study, 1 subgroup of subjects  currently 
treated with short/rapid- acting β2-adrenoreceptor agonist ( SABA ) prn  alone, and a second  
subgroup on low- to-medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) maintenance therapy 
(according to Global Initiative for Asthma [ GINA ] guideli nes) and SABA prn .  
Duration of treatment  
The r andomiz ed treatment phase will start after a 1 to 2- week screening period  (Visits 1 and 
2). The double-blind treatment will occur with single dosing of investigational product (IP) at 
Visits [ADDRESS_875415] will be BDA MDI  and a matching placebo  MDI , which will be used as 
the compa rator.  The IP will be administered as a single dose as follows: 
• BDA MDI 160/180 μg (given as 2 inhalations of BDA MDI 80/90 μg per puff)  
• Placebo MDI (given as 2 inhalations) 
At Visit 3 /Period 1 and Visit 4 /Period 2, IP will be administered 30 (±5) minutes prior to the 
exercise challenge. During the study, subjects will not be allowed to use any asthma 
medication other than the SABA  prn or ICS  plus SABA  prn that they were using before study 
entry . Subjects will be restricted from SABA within 6 hours before a ny lung function testing 
and/or exercise testing.  Non- asthma medications which are necessary for the subject ’s safety 
and wellbeing , and which do not affect the participation in or results of the study, are allowed  
at the discretion of the investigator . 
 
Statistical methods  
Sample Size  
Prior studies of a similar design have randomized subject s who experience exercise-induced 
symptoms without other generaliz ed asthma symptoms. Other studies have permitted 
enrollment of those subject s experiencing exercise sy mptoms who may or may not be subjects 
with asthma  (Bonini et al 2013). This study will only randomize subject s with asthma who are 
receiving background therapy for asthma (SABA prn alone; low- to-medium dose ICS plus 
SABA  prn). Sub-analyses will be conducted on the primary endpoint for each of these 
subgroups of equal size.

exercise challenge. A sample size of 30 subjects in each subgroup will provide a 92% 
probability to detect a difference of -9% between BDA MDI versu s placebo MDI, within each 
of the [ADDRESS_875417] (SABA prn  alone; low- to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn), 
assuming 2 -sided, 5% level tests and a within -subject standard deviation of 10%. 
Randomization of 60 subjects in total will provide >99% overall probability to detect a difference of - 9% between BDA MDI v ersus placebo MDI assuming a 2- sided, 5% level test 
and an estimated within -subject standard deviation of 10%. Since all subjects randomized in 
the study will be receiving background therapy for asthma, a more conservative estimate of 
variability and treatment effect has been assumed compared to studies of simi lar design 
(Ostrom et al 2015). 
Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The maximum percentage fall from post-dose, pre -exercise baseline in FEV
[ADDRESS_875418]-dose value, ie, 5 minutes before exercise challenge, at each visit for the 
respective treatment . The period- specific pre -dose baseline FEV 1 will be calculated separately 
at Visit 3 and Visit 4 as the pre -dose result, approximately 5 minutes prior to dosing. The 
average pre- dose baseline FEV 1 will be calculated as the mean  of the period -specific pre -dose 
FEV 1 baselines. Estimated treatment differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be 
provided. 
The primary analysis will be repeated on the s ubgroups on clinical interest (SABA prn alone; 
low-to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn). To control the overall type- I error, a hierarchical 
testing strategy will be adopted. The treatment comparisons of BDA MDI 160/[ADDRESS_875419]  populations in the sequence given below: 
1. Overall population (SABA prn only OR low- to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn 
background therapy) 
2. Subjects  taking SABA prn only for background therapy 
3. Subjects  taking low- to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn for background therapy 
If a comparison is significant (alpha=0.05, 2- sided), testing will proceed to the next 
comparison. Comparisons will stop if a non- statistically significant result occurs. All 
comparisons are of superiority.

The percentage of subjects with a maximum percentage fall in FEV [ADDRESS_875421]- exercise challenge 
of <10% will be tabulated by [CONTACT_3148].  
The odds of having a maximum percentage fall in FEV [ADDRESS_875422]- exercise challenge of < 10% will 
be analy zed using a generali zed linear mixed model with logit link function  to compare the 
treatments . The model will be adjusted for treatment, treatment period , treatment sequence, 
and a random subject within treatment sequence effect . The odds ratio and 95% CI will be 
reported for pairwise treatment comparisons. The odds of having a maximum percentage fall 
in FEV [ADDRESS_875423]- exercise challenge of <20% will be separately analyzed in a similar manner.  
Time to recovery at each of Visits 3 and 4 will be derived as the time (minutes) post- exercise 
challenge in which the FEV 1 result returns to  within  10% of the value recorded at the post-
dose, pre -exercise baseline. Only subjects who achieve a percentage fall in FEV [ADDRESS_875424]- exercise 
challenge of >10% will have an event time derived; otherwise their value will be left censored. Subjects who have any rescue medication administered during the post-dose assessments will be censored at the time of receiving rescue medication. Subjects who do not 
recover to within 10% of the post-dose, pre -exercise baseline will be censored at [ADDRESS_875425] s 
into period preferences (Senn 1993).  
The percentage fall in FEV

The estimand of interest is the Efficacy Estimand, defined as the effect of the randomized 
treatments in all subjects in the absence of intercurrent events which may impact the interpretation of t he treatment effect, such as use of rescue medication following the exercise 
challenge test. This estimand could be considered a while-on- treatment strategy or a 
hypothetical strategy as defined in the draft International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH)

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   14 of 70  1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Backgrou nd  
Bond Avillion 2 Development LP (Sponsor) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_280797]/albuterol sulfate 
(PT027, a fixed -dose combination product; hereafter referred to as budesonide and albuterol 
metered -dose inhaler [BDA MDI]) pressurized inhalation suspension product in  adults and 
children ( ≥4 years of age ) with asthma. Please refer to the current  Investigator Brochure  for 
additional information. 
Albuterol is a short/rapid -acting β2 -adrenoreceptor agonist (SABA), inducing airway smooth 
muscle relaxation and reducing or preventing bronchoconstriction. Albuterol is approved in 
many countries in multiple formulations for treatment or prevention of bronchoconstriction, and is also known under the generic name [CONTACT_652349]. In clinical practice, albuterol is used as reli ever therapy on an as -needed (prn) basis ( Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA]  
guidelines ).  
Budesonide is a well-established anti- inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent 
glucocorticoid and weak mineralocorticoid activity and is approved worldwide in inhaled formulations for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease both as a 
mono-product and in combination with a long- acting β2-agonist ( LABA ), (ie , formoterol).  
In vitro studies have demonstrated that inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) agents potentiate the 
effects of SABAs in reducing airway smooth muscle tone ( Mendes et al 2008) and can reverse 
adrenergic receptor tolerance and desensitization ( Cooper and Panettieri 2008). Clinically, 
similar functional potentiation with combined ICSs and albuterol has been observed in patients with asthma for functional measures of airway smooth muscle and airway blood flow (Mendes et al 2015 ).  
Combining albuterol with budesonide in the proposed BDA MDI combination product should 
not only provide rapid bronchodilation, but also treat worsening airway inflammation by [CONTACT_652338]. Pe r current treatment guidelines ( GINA 2019), 
ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever can be used in patients with asthma. Studies of budesonide and a rapid-acting LABA (formoterol) as reliever therapy have demonst rated 
enhanced protection from severe exacerbations in patients already receiving combination therapy for maintenance without an increase in adverse effects ( O'By[CONTACT_129120] 2005, Rabe et al 
2006). In addition, budesonide/formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy or “ Symbicort 
Maintenance And Reliever Therapy ( SMART )” (available commercially as the Symbicort 
Turbuhaler [Symbicort] in the European Union and other markets) significantly reduced 
severe exacerbation risk in pediatric patients ( O'By[CONTACT_7943] 2007).  
In some markets, Symbicort is approved for maintenance and reliever therapy. With SMART 
application, patients with asthma use Symbicort as maintenance inhalation medication and

Budesonide/Albuterol Sulfate (BDA) , AV005  Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_875442] on 
improvement of lung function and achieving asthma improvement beyond what is seen with 
albuterol and budesonide alone. Current treatment guidelines ( GINA 2019 ) recommend 
addition of low- dose I CS to SABA used as reliever medication as early as in GINA step 1 
asthma (previously treated with SABA prn alone), broadening the range of asthma severity 
grades that would be treated by [CONTACT_280851] β2-adrenoreceptor agonist. Anti- inflammatory 
and bronchodilation components used prn in a fixed -dose combination are expected to result 
in overall better asthma control and decreased risk of experiencing asthma symptoms than 
bronchodilation alone. 
1.2 Exercise- induced bronchoconstriction  
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) describes acute airway narrowing that occurs as a 
result of exercise. EIB occurs in a substantial proportion of patients with asthma, but may also 
occur in individuals without an  asthma  diagnosis. The quality of evidence supporting the 
recommendations for the treatment of EIB is variable. Recommendations include using a n 
inhaled  SABA at least [ADDRESS_875443] cell stabilizing agent before exercise ( Parsons et al 2013). Inhaled 
disodium cromog lycate and β 2-agonists administered immediately before an exercise 
challenge test (ECT) also provide good protection ( Molema et al 1989, Richter et al 2002).  
1.3 Rationale f or study design, doses and control groups  
TYREE  is a multicenter , randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, single -dose, 
crossover study in adults and adolescents (12 to 70 years of age) with asthma and EIB . This 
Phase III study is conducted in addition to the AV003- MANDALA exacerbation and AV004-
DENALI lung function studies.  
Asthma patients with EIB , who  use their SABA reliever therapy prophylactically before 
exercise to prevent EIB , may benefit from a fixed -dosed combination (BDA MDI) , taken prior 
to exercise, to prevent asthma symptoms. The TYREE study will assess the  efficacy and 
safety of single -dose BDA MDI as  compared with placebo  MDI  in subjects with asthma and 
EIB. It is important to evaluate whether BDA MDI would prevent or reduce 
bronchoconstriction when used prophylactically.

compared with placebo  MDI : 
1) The maximum percentage fall from post-dose, pre- exercise baseline in forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_184849] 1 second ( FEV 1) up to [ADDRESS_875445]- exercise challenge  
2) The percentage of subjects with a maximum percentage fall in FEV [ADDRESS_875446]- exercise 
challenge of < 10% 
1.4 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment  
The study will be c onducted in accordance with International C onference on Harmonisation 
(ICH) guidelines . Permission from the research ethics committee (EC) will be sought and the 
study will start only after authorization. In the study, s ingle -dose treatment and a comparison 
with placebo is necessary, to show that the presumed protection against EIB  is an  effect of 
active treatment.  
To mitigate any potential risks, all subjects will be closely monitored to ensure subject safety. 
At study visits, subjects will only be discharged from the clinic after satisfactory lun g function 
based on the investigator ’s clinical judgment.  
The study will be conducted in a similar design as previously published studies ( eg, Ostrom et 
al 2015). When considering and assessing all non- clinical and clinical data available for study 
treatments, the Sponsor considers the risk and benefit profile of Study TYREE to be 
acceptable.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   23 of 70  Approximately 120 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 70 years of age) will need to be 
screened  for asthma and EIB , assuming an estimated screen failure rate of 50 % prior to 
randomization.  
Approximately 60 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 70 years of age) will be randomiz ed 
1:1 to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (ie , A/B or B/A) as described in Table 1.  
Randomiz ation will be centralized and stratified by [CONTACT_654] (adults: 18  to 70; adolescents:  12 to 
17) and background ICS therapy (ICS or no ICS). Investigator(s) should keep a record, ie, the subject screening log, of subjects who entered pre-
study screening.  
The i nvestigator(s) will:  
1 Obtain signed informed consent /assent (as applicable)  from the potential subject and/ or 
their guardian/legal representative  before any study -specific procedures are performed.

The 2 different kit types of study IP and placebo  are visually identical, protecting the blind 
through their similarity in appearance.  
3.7 Methods for unblinding  
The treatment blind should not be broken except in medical emergencies and based on the investigator’s clinical judgment, when the appropriate management and welfare of the subject requires knowledge of the treatment allocation. Individual treatment details, for each subject, 
will be available to the investigator(s) or pharmacists from the IWRS, if needed. If unblinding 
occurs, the investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible, but without  revealing the 
treatment assign ment of the unblinded subject. Routines for this will be described in the IWRS 
user manual that will be provided to each center. The IWRS provides unblinding procedures, 
if needed.  
The designated representative retains the right to break the code for SAEs  that are unexpected 
and are suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited 
reporting to regulatory authorities. Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned 
analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual subject 
have been made and documented.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   25 of 70  With the exception of emergency unblinding as described above, all members of the study 
team, investigators, and site staff will be blinded.  
3.8 Restrictions 
During the study, subjects are not allowed to use any asthma medication other than the IP and their background treatment (ie, SABA  prn alone or ICS  with  SABA) that was started before 
screening and continued as part of their asthma treatment (see inclusion criteria). Non- asthma 
medications which are necessary for the subjec t’s wellbeing and which do not affect the 
participation or results of the study are allowed  at the investigator’s discretion . All such 
medication should be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. 
3.9 Criteria for study withdrawal  
At any time, s ubjects may withdraw from the study (ie, study procedures/ visits) at their own 
request  (or their parent/legal representative’s request, as applicable) for any reason, without 
prejudice. Subjects may also be withdrawn from the study upon request of the investigator, or by [CONTACT_280859] . Some reasons  for study withdrawal  include:  
• An AE or other unacceptable toxicity considered to jeopardiz e the safety of a subject 
participating in the study.  
• Subjects who suffer 1 se vere exacerbation or worsening of asthma that in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_652318]-term disease course or stability of lung function will be discontinued if the Sponsor and the investigator decide that it is in the best interest of the subject to withdraw from  the study.  
• General or specific change(s) in the subject's condition that render(s) him/her ineligible 
for further participation according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Non-compliance: i n the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the subject is non- compliant with the 
requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol (eg, post-enroll ment eligibility violation) .  
• Lost to Follow-up: t he subject is  lost to follow -up and no alternative contact [CONTACT_652342] (this implies that at least [ADDRESS_875480]) . 
• Intercurrent illness: a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the subject’s termination from the study, eg, a symptomatic lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_652319] s at 
potential risk and interferes with the subject’s ability to carry out the required procedures. 
• Pregnancy ; if a female subject becomes pregnant, she will be immediately withdrawn 
from the study. 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the study site must immediately notify 
the medical monitor. The date and the reason for study withdrawal  must be recorded on the 
eCRF. The subject will be asked to complete a premature discontinuation visit (PDV) and the

Budesonide/Albuterol Sulfate (BDA) , AV005  Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_875481] study visit 
or PDV, as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2).  
In the event that a subject with draws prematurely from the study because of an AE or S AE, 
the AE/SAE will be followed up until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline values) or 
stabilizes, or until it is judged by [CONTACT_190374].  
Once a subject is withdrawn from the study, the subject may not re -enter the study.  If a subject 
withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrollment/randomization code cannot 
be reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.  
3.9.[ADDRESS_875482] the reason for study withdrawal 
recorded as “ Screen failure” (the potential subject who does not meet 1 or mo re criteria 
required for participation in a trial, this reason for study withdrawal is only valid for non-
randomiz ed subjects). Subjects who are screen failures will not be rescreened.  
Subjects who fail to meet Visit 1/Visit [ADDRESS_875483] ing. See 
Section  4.1.2 for specific details  on all retesting .  
3.10 Discontinuation of the study  
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of the Sponsor , trial subjects are placed at undue 
risk because of clinically sign ificant findings that:  
• meet individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_652320]  
• are assessed as causally related to study drug  
• are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study 
Regardless of the reason for termination, a ll data available for the subject at the time of 
discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the e CRF . All reasons for discontinuation of 
treatment must be documented. 
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the subjects’ interests.

To ensure standardization, it is recommended that sites review and remind /discuss the 
following with the subject on at least the day before a scheduled visit , as applicable: 
• Site personnel wi ll remind/instruct subjects not to take any prohibited asthma medications 
during the study. Non- asthma medications which are necessary for the subject’s 
wellbeing and which do not affect the participation in or results of the study, are allowed. 
All such medication should be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
− At every visit during which lung function testing will be performed, subjects must 
withhold SABA for at least [ADDRESS_875487] 
should not be carried out and the visit should be rescheduled.    
• Subjects are not allowed to perform physical exercise during the 24 hours prior to the 
visits.  
• Subjects must not ingest/consume xanthine and/or xanthine analogue (caffeine) -
containing foods and beverages for at least 6 hours prior to each study visit and for the 
duration of each study visit. Examples of such products include coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola. Decaffeinated beverages are acceptable.  
• Subjects should avoid having a large meal at least 2 hours prior to a study visit. 
• Subjects will be required to return to the clinic at approximately the same time beginning at Visit 2 for all visits (±2 hours of timing of Visit 1). T herefore, all  subject s 
appointments must be scheduled  with careful attention to the following criteria: 
 
− The first  spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] a ssessment  each at Visits 2, 3, and 4 should be completed prior 
to 11:00 AM and within ±[ADDRESS_875488] spi[INVESTIGATOR_652321] a t Visit 1.  
− After Visit 1, every attempt should be made to have subsequent ECTs done ±2 hours 
of the timing of the exercise challenge done at Visit 1.  
− Subjects will be required to remain at clinic until completion of all protocol-defined 
assessments. To mi nimize diurnal variance, sites should make every effort to assess 
subjects at the same time throughout the study.

relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom ( eg, nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre- existing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including 
the screening  period, even if no IP has been administered . 
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event  
An SAE  is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, after the signing of the informed 
consent/assent through to the safety follow-up TC ), that fulfill s 1 or more of the following 
criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   41 of 70  • Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8686]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopar dize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above 
For further guidance on the definition of an SAE, see Appendix C . 
6.3 Recording of adverse events  
6.3.1 Period for collection of adverse events 
Adverse events (including SAEs) will be collected from the time of signature [CONTACT_62686] /assent  through the safety follow-up TC . 
6.3.[ADDRESS_875539]’s last assessment visi t in the study are followed up 
by [CONTACT_24549], but without further recording in the 
eCRF. The Sponsor or a  Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department 
representative retains the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study (after the subject’s follow- up telephone call) and capture 
that information in the eCRF , if judged necessary.  
6.3.3 Variables  
The following variables will be collected  for each AE : 
• AE (verbatim)  
• Dates when the AE started and stopped 
• Maximum severity  
• Seriousness 
• Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no) 
• Action taken with regard to the IP  
• Outcome 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs, when applicable: 
• Date AE met criteria for SAE 
• Date the investigator became aware of S AE 
• Reason why the AE is considered serious 
• Treatment given for the SAE  
• Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652333] 2 Development LP  
Budesonide/Albuterol Sulfate (BDA) , AV005  Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_875540] 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   42 of 70  • Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Whether an autopsy is  performed  
• Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s) 
• Causality assessment to other medication  
• Description of AE 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_652343] 6.2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. 
The severity of the event should be assessed as mild, moderate, or severe.  
6.3.4 Causality collection 
The investigator and the Sponsor will assess causal relationship between IP and each AE , and 
answer “yes” or “no” to the question “Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?” For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as “ yes”. 
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix C . 
6.3.[ADDRESS_875541] or care provider  or reported in response to the 
open question from the study site staff: “ Have you/ your child had any health problems since 
the previous visit/you (or your child) were last asked?” , or revealed by [CONTACT_652344]. When collecting AEs, recording a diagnosi s is preferred 
(when possible) to the recording of a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, t he 
diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 
Asthma symptoms or signs, such as wheeze, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, breathlessness, 
and phlegm, will be recorded as AEs only when:

• The subject discontinues the study because of  the sign or symptom 
• The sign or symptom is new to the subject or not consistent with the subject’s pre- existing 
asthma history (defined as within 1 year of Visit 1) as judged by [CONTACT_093] 
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests 
The results from the Clinical Study Protocol mandated laboratory tests , ECGs,  vital signs  (ie, 
blood pressure and heart  rate) and other assessments will be summarized in the C linical S tudy 
Report. Deterioration from  baseline in these parameters  should therefore only be reported as 
AEs if they fulfill any of the AE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation from the study or 
are considered “clinically significant .” 
The criteria for determining whether the mandated laboratory tests, ECGs, vita l signs, and 
other assessments are clinically significant and should be reported as AEs are generally:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms or signs, and/or  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or  
• Test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_76617]. 
If deterioration  in a laboratory value, ECG, vital sign , or other assessment  is associated with

6.7 Medication error 
For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for the Sponsor’s IP that either causes harm to the subject or has the 
potential to cause harm to the subject.  
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process- related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or subject.

The safety analysis set is defined as all subjects receiving any amount of the IP. Subjects will 
be classified on the basis of treatment they actually received within each treatment period . 
Occurrences of safety events (ie, AE s and use of concomitant medication) will be summariz ed 
under the actual treatment corresponding to the treatment period of which the event occurred. 
All safety summaries will be based on the safety analysis set.

assessments will be censored at the time of receiving rescue medication. Subjects who do not 
recover to within 10% of the post-dose, pre -exercise baseline will be censored at [ADDRESS_875577]-dose, pre -exercise baseline 
using t he trapezoidal rule and will be normalized by [CONTACT_652345] (in minutes)

H01: Difference between treatment s =0,  
HA1: Difference between treatment s ≠0. 
The primary treatment comparison  of BDA MDI 160/[ADDRESS_875581]- exercise challenge will be conducted on the full analysis set and include all data 
up to study withdrawal as per the E fficacy Estimand  (Section 8.1.1). Missing results for 
maximum percentage fall in FEV 1 is unlikely (ie, rescue medication prior to the collection of 
the 5 minutes measure) and will be assumed to be missing at random. Sensitivity analyses will 
be conducted to explore the robustness of the primary analysis with respect to this missing data assumption ( Section 8.6.6).  
The primary analysis will be repeated on t he subgroups on clinical interest (SABA prn alone; 
low-to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn). To control the overall type -I error, a hierarchical 
testing strategy will be adopted. The treatment comparisons of BDA MDI 160/[ADDRESS_875582]  populations in the sequence given below:  
1. Overall population (SABA prn only OR low- to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn 
background therapy) 
2. Subjects  taking SABA prn only for background therapy  
3. Subjects  taking low- to-medium dose ICS plus SABA prn for background therapy 
If a comparison is significant (alpha=0.05, 2- sided), testing will proceed to the next 
comparison. Comparisons will stop if a non- statistically significant result occurs. All 
comparisons are of superiority.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   67 of 70  APPENDIX C ADDITIONAL SAFETY INFORMATION 
Further guidance on the d efinition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Life-threatening  
“Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
subject’s death. “ Life-threatening” does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_652336]-patient treatment in an emergen cy room is not in itself a n SAE, although the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the subject was enrol led in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way 
during the study. 
Important medical event or medical intervention  
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_875606] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used. Examples of important medical events include but are not limited to: 
• Angio edema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone treatment 
• Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for  allergic bronchospasm 
• Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838]  
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
 
A guide to i nterpreting the causality q uestion  
When making an assessment of causality , consider the following factors when deciding if 
there is a “ reasonable possibility”  that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY   68 of 70  • Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the subject actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? 
• Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties? 
• De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_122570]? 
• No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748]/ etiology 
such as , the underlying disease, other drugs, and other host or environmental factors. 
• Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? The Sponsor would not normally recommend or support a re -
challenge. 
• Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship . 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: 
• Is this a recognized  feature of overdose of the drug? 
• Is there a known mechanism?  
Causality of “related” is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for 
a “reasonable possibility”  of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression 
“reasonable possibility” of a causal relat ionship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments  to suggest a causal relationship. 
The causality assessment is performed on the basis of the available data including enough information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is highly encouraged for the reporting investigator to express his/her clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. If (despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510]) the causality assessment cannot be made, these SAEs will be considered to be “ related .” 
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated because of  lack of 
effect should be classified as “no reasonable possibility.”

Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018 1.0 Background 
 
1.1 High dose therapy and stem cell transplantation (SCT) remain the standard of 
care for patients with myeloma (MM) who are eligible to undergo the procedure.(Attal, Harousseau et al. 1996; Child, Morgan et al. 2003; Kumar 2009) It is an effective therapy, with im provement in overall survival and quality 
of life (time without symptoms and tr eatment) compared to conventional 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. However, patients with MM undergoing SCT invariably suffer disease 
relapse after a median duration of [ADDRESS_494877]. Patients with high prolif erative rates of tumor cells, those with 
high International Staging System (ISS) st age and those with adverse cytogenetic 
profile, such as presence of t(4;14) and t(14;16) are at a higher risk.(Gertz, Lacy et al. 2005) Strategies to improve the duration of response to SCT can contribute 
to improved patient wellbeing and potentia lly improve survival, and become an 
integral part of the therapeutic appr oach to MM. The high dose chemotherapy 
allows significant tumor control and the ability to overcome drug resistance. The 
condition regimen most commonly used fo r autologous transplantation is the 
melphalan 200 mg/m2, which has not changed significantly in the past decade. 
Attempts to improve upon the conditioning by [CONTACT_394317] 280 mg/m2, 
or by [CONTACT_394318], have met with no success.  Single arm studies of bone targeting radiation using radioisotopes like samarium have shown 
interesting results. Several classes of new drugs have become available for the treatment of MM. Proteasome inhibitors, in particular, have been successful in 
terms of their efficacy in this disease.  
 1.2 Proteasome inhibitors for MM: The proteasome is a multi-catalytic proteinase 
complex that is responsible for degradation of a wide variety of protein substrates within normal and transformed cells.  Intracellular proteins targeted for 
degradation by [CONTACT_394319].  Ubiquitinated proteins are cleaved within the proteasome by 
[CONTACT_394320]: a chymotrypsin-like activity, a trypsin-like activity,  and a caspase-like activity.   
 1.[ADDRESS_494878] examined the role of adding bortezomib to melphalan conditioning.(Lonial, Kaufman et al. 2010; Roussel, Moreau et al. 2010) In both 
these single arm trials, the combination was well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events. In the Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM) phase 2 
study, 54 untreated patients were enrolled to receive bortezomib (1 mg/m (2) x 4) 
and melphalan (200 mg/m (2)) as the conditioning regimen (Bor-
HDM).(Roussel, Moreau et al. 2010) Overall, 70% of patients achieved at least a very good partial response (VGPR), incl uding 17 patients with a complete 
response (CR) (32%) after SCT. No toxic deaths were observed. Bortezomib did not increase hematologic toxicity. Only one grade 3 to 4 peripheral neuropathy 
was reported. A matched control analys is was conducted comparing this cohort 
with patients from the IFM 2005-01 trial,  which used melphalan alone. Patients 
were matched for response to induction therapy and type of induction: CR was 
higher in the Bor-HDM group (35% vs 11%; P = .001), regardless of induction 
MC1185 6 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018 therapy. Lonial, et al conducted a randomized phase I/II trial designed to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of combining the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with high-dose melphalan as the conditioning for high-dose therapy and autologous 
transplant for myeloma.(Lonial, Kaufman et al. 2010) The study enrolled patients who did not achieve a very good partial remission (VGPR) following one or more induction regimens, and were ra ndomized to receive a single escalating 
dose of bortezomib (1.0, 1.3, or 1.6 mg/m (2)), either 24 hours before or 24 hours after high-dose melphalan. Dose escalation was based on the escalation with overdose control, a Bayesian statisti cal model. Among 39 randomized patients, 
20 received bortezomib after melphalan and 19 received bortezomib before -similar between the arms. The overall response rate for all patients was 87%, with 51% achieving a VGPR or better. Pharmacodynamic studies showed greater plasma cell apoptosis among patients who received bortezomib following melphalan. A single dose of bortezomib administered after high-dose melphalan 
was safe, with data suggesting improved efficacy. 
 
1.4 Carfilzomib (PR-171) is a tetrapeptid e keto-epoxide-based inhibitor specific for 
the chymotrypsin-like active site of the 20S proteasome.(Kuhn, Chen et al. 2007; Parlati, Lee et al. 2009; Khan and Stewar t 2011)  Carfilzomib is structurally and 
mechanistically distinct from the dipep tide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor, 
bortezomib (Velcade
®).  In addition, when measured against a broad panel of 
proteases, including metallo-, aspartyl, and serine proteases, carfilzomib demonstrated less reactivity against non-proteasomal proteases when compared 
to bortezomib.(Demo, Kirk et al. 2007; Arastu-Kapur, Shenk et al. 2008) 
 
1.5  CARFILZOMIB Toxicology Studies: In the initial Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP)-compliant toxicity studies done by [CONTACT_394321], Onyx, carfilzomib was 
administered to rats and monkeys as two complete two-week cycles of QD for five days, with nine days rest.(Kirk, Jiang et al. 2008)  The administration of 12 mg/m
2 to rats, which was the toxic dose in 10% of animals (STD 10), resulted 
in > 90% proteasome inhibition in red blood cells one hour after dosing.  Overall, 
stronger inhibition of the proteasome and longer duration of inhibition was tolerated with carfilzomib compared with  bortezomib.  Daily administration of 
bortezomib at anti-tumor doses is not tolerated in animals and, therefore, daily bortezomib has not been given in the clinic.  A dose-dependent decrease in proteasome activity was demonstrated in animals, and equivalent levels of 
proteasome inhibition were achieved with administration of carfilzomib, as either 
an intravenous (IV) push or an IV infu sion.  The dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
of carfilzomib, in both the rat and monkey [ADDRESS_494879], bone marrow, pulmonary, and cardiovascular systems.  No behavioral or histopathological signs of 
neurotoxicity were observed, and carfilzomib does not cross the blood-brain 
barrier. 
 
In 6-month rat and 9-month chronic toxicity studies, carfilzomib was administered on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle, mimicking the active anti-tumor regimen being used in ongoing Phase II studies in MM and 
solid tumors
3.  Tolerability was excellent, with no evidence of peripheral (or 
central) neurotoxicity, including neuropathology, even at high doses.  This is in 
stark contrast to that observed with bortezomib.(Bross, Kane et al. 2004)  The 
DLTs of carfilzomib included effects on the gastrointestinal, renal, pulmonary, 
MC1185 7 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018 and cardiovascular systems and appeared to be  related to Cmax effects.  Of note, 
neutropenia was not observed; rather, transient neutrophilia was seen following 
acute dosing.  The renal, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities were 
similar to those observed with bortezomib.  Finally, cyclical thrombocytopenia, likely due to inhibition of platelet budding from megakaryocytes, was similar to that seen with bortezomib.  Proteasome inhibition in the blood in excess of 90% was achievable at well-tolerated doses, which contrasts with the ~70% proteasome inhibition achievable with bortezomib at its maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  In summary, these animal toxic ity studies support the tolerability of 
carfilzomib in clinical studies, even on intensive dosing schedules, and at doses 
achieving proteasome inhibition in excess of what can be achieve with bortezomib at its MTD, on a less intensive schedule. 
 
1.6  Carfilzomib Preclinical Antitumor Activity: Based upon the results of in vitro  
and in vivo  studies, it is anticipated that the more intense and longer duration of 
proteasome inhibition that can be achieved with carfilzomib will result in 
enhanced anti-tumor activity relative to bortezomib.  Continuous (72 hr) exposure to carfilzomib is associated with potent cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activity across a broad panel of tumor-deriv ed cell lines in culture.(Demo, Kirk et 
al. 2007; Kuhn, Chen et al. 2007) Incubation of hematologic tumor cell lines with carfilzomib for as little as one hour leads to rapid inhibition of proteasome activity, followed by [CONTACT_394322].  Carfilzomib has also been demonstrated to be cytotoxic in bortezomib-resistant tumor cell lines. (Demo, Kirk et al. 2007; Kuhn, Chen et al. 2007)
 
 
The anti-tumor efficacy of carfilzomib h as been tested in immunocompromised 
mice implanted with a variety of tumor cell lines.  In a human colorectal adenocarcinoma model HT-29, administration of carfilzomib on a twice-weekly Day 1, Day [ADDRESS_494880] Day 1, Day 4 schedule(Demo, Kirk et al. 2007).
 
 1.7  Phase I Experience with Carfilzomib as a Monotherapy: A Phase I clinical 
trial, PX-171-002, testing carfilzomib in subjects with relapsed/refractory 
hematologic malignancies, is being co mpleted.(Alsina, Trudel et al. 2007) 
During the dose escalation portion of the trial, 36 subjects received carfilzomib on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle.  Subjects with MM, Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL), Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (WM), and 
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (HL) were enrolled on the study.   
 
No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in the initial seven cohorts 
(doses ranged from 1.2 to 15 mg/m
2) of three subjects each.  At the 20 mg/m2 
dose level, one of eight patients had a Grade 3 renal failure at Cycle 1, day 2, which was considered possibly related to study drug and lasted for six days.  The 
patient continued on study for the rema inder of Cycle 1 before having disease 
progression.   At the 27 mg/m
2 dose level, one of six subjects experienced a DLT 
during Cycle 1, consisting of severe hypoxia with pulmonary infiltrates following 
Day 2 of dosing.  In subjects where the 27 mg/m2 dose was efficacious, a “first 
MC1185 8 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, [ADDRESS_494881]” was seen that included a conste llation of findings that appeared to be 
the clinical sequelae of rapid tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and/or cytokine 
release.  This effect was notable for fever, chills, and/or rigors occurring during 
the evening following the first day of infusion.  On the second day, three of five subjects with MM experienced an increase in creatinine to Grade 2 (including the subject with the DLT).  This elevati on was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_394307]-challenged with carfilzom ib without recurrence of the events.  
Interestingly, all three subjects had a rapid decline in serum and/or urine M-protein levels; two subjects achieved a partial response (PR), and the third 
subject achieved a minimal response (MR).  There were no consistent changes in potassium, calcium, phosphorous, or uric aci d levels, although some increases in 
LDH and other markers of tumor lysis were noted.  Because of the possible TLS and reversible creatinine elevations, h ydration and very-low dose dexamethasone 
prophylaxis were instituted in subseque nt studies and have essentially eliminated 
clinically significant TLS/creatinine elevati ons and the other “first-dose” effects.   
 
Hematologic toxicities were primarily m ild or moderate.  The thrombocytopenia 
reported with carfilzomib is cyclical and si milar to that reported with bortezomib.  
The cause and kinetics of the thrombocytopenia following treatment are different 
from those of standard cytotoxic agents .  To maximize the likely benefit of 
carfilzomib, subjects with thrombocytopen ia should be supported as clinically 
indicated, rather than having treatment reduced due to thrombocytopenia. 
 
Of the 36 evaluable patients enrolled in  PX-171-002, 20 had MM.(Alsina, Trudel 
et al. 2007)  Four MM patients achieved a partial response (PR), one of two at the 15 mg/m
2 dose, one of six at the 20 mg/m2 dose, and two of five at the 27 mg/m2 
dose.  The responses have been rapid in onset, beginning in some subjects after 
1-2 doses.  The duration of response (DOR) ranged from 134 to 392 days. The minimal effective dose was 15 mg/m
2, wherein >80% proteasome inhibition in 
peripheral blood and mononuclear cells was observed one hour after dosing.  The 
median number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_394308], and 
responses were seen in subjects who had relapsed from (including some refractory to) bortezomib and/or immunomodulatory agents.  Stable disease also occurred in four NHL and five MM subjects, with subjects on therapy for up to 409 days.  Such prolonged therapy, at “full” twice-weekly doses, is not possible with bortezomib.  These results led to the initiation of two Phase II studies. 
 1.8  Phase II Experience with Carfilzomib as a monotherapy: Two Phase II 
clinical studies are ongoing with carfilzomib in MM patients, PX-171-003-A0 (N=46) in relapsed and refractory MM, and PX-171-004 (N=39) in relapsed MM.  
In both studies, patients were dosed with 20 mg/m
[ADDRESS_494882] been reported, 
including in >[ADDRESS_494883] common adverse events were fatigue, anemia, thrombocytopenia (primar ily cyclical), gastrointestinal, and 
dyspnea.  Almost all were Grades 1 or 2.  There were reported cases of increases in serum creatinine that were primarily < Grade 2, and were transient, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_1920], and non-cumulative.  A ve ry low rate of treatment-emergent 
peripheral neuropathy, 2.2%, Grade 3/4, was observed in PX-171-003-A0, 
MC1185 9 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, [ADDRESS_494884] that 78% of patients had Grade 1/2 neuropathy upon study 
entry.(Jagannath, Vij et al. 2010)  
 
The response rate in PX-171-003-A0 was 18% PR, 7% MR and 41% SD in these 
patients that entered the study with pr ogressive disease, and were refractory to 
their most recent therapy, often including bortezomib and/or an immunomodulatory drug (usually lenalidomide).  The median time to progression on the PX-171-003-A0 study was 5.1 months, with a DOR of 7.4 months (mean follow up of 7.6 months).
 (Jagannath, Vij et al. 2010) 
 
A “stepped up” dosing schedule, referred to as 20/27 mg/m2, has subsequently 
been incorporated into the PX-171-003 study (referred to as PX-171-003-A1) in order to maximize the clinical benefit of carfilzomib.  Patients receive 20 mg/m
[ADDRESS_494885] cycle and 27 mg/m2 thereafter.  The study completed enrollment of 
266 patients by [CONTACT_5638] 2009, and may form the basis for an accelerated approval NDA filing by [CONTACT_5638] 2010.  To date, this dosing schedule has been well tolerated.
7 An independent Safety Oversight Group (SOG) evaluated the 
safety data from the 40 of 250 patients to be enrolled on the 20/27 schedule and agreed that the trial should proceed without modification.  No cases of TLS were 
observed, and rates of BUN and creatinine elevation dropped sharply, with Grade 
3/4 renal impairment droppi[INVESTIGATOR_86286] 2.2% in A1 (from 15% in A0), most likely due to hydration and very low dose dexameth asone.  The other most common adverse 
events were similar to the A0 portion of the study.  Treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy remains low on this portion of the study, with 15% Grade 1/2 and one (0.7%) Grade 3/4 event reported to date on PX-171-003-A1. In 
addition, anemia rates in the PX-171-003- A1 (higher dose) were lower than those 
reported in the PX-171-003–A0 portion of the study, possibly indicating that the 
higher dose of carfilzomib is achieving be tter clearing of neoplastic cells in the 
bone marrow, allowing for superior nor mal marrow reconstitution.  Rates of 
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were similar between the two cohorts, with 
Grade 3 neutropenia in ~5%, without any Grade [ADDRESS_494886] cohort of patients received 20 mg/m2.  The subset of patients (N=54) that had not seen bort ezomib had an ORR of 46% (2% CR, 9% 
VGPR and 35% PR), while the bortezomib treated patients (N=33), had an ORR of 18% (3% CR, 3% VGPR, and 12% PR).(Siegel, Wang et al. 2009; Wang, 
Siegel et al. 2009) The median time to progression (TTP) was 7.[ADDRESS_494887] not pr eviously been treated with bortezomib 
and, even in bortezomib-treated patient s, substantial anti-tumor activity is 
observed.  Of note, disease control (PR + MR (minimal response) + (stable 
disease) SD) was achieved in ~65% of patients with progressive MM entering the 
study.  Patients on these studies have been treated for >12 cycles with good tolerability and no cumulative toxicities (e.g., bone marrow, severe fatigue, or 
neuropathy) have been observed. The prot ocol was amended to allow patients to 
increase to 27 mg/m2 in Cycle 2 or later based on tolerability, similar to that used in PX-171-003 – A1.  Further informat ion about the Phase II studies is presented 
in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
 1.9a Dose Rationale: Preliminary data suggest that carfilzomib as a single agent can 
produce substantial response rates in myeloma subjects across a variety of dosing 
MC1185 10 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018 cohorts.  Responses were seen over a wide therapeutic window, from 15 to 27 
mg/m2.  Maximum proteasome inhibition was seen at doses 11 mg/m2 and higher 
in whole blood samples taken [ADDRESS_494888] dose.  The final analysis of the 
human pharmacokinetic (PK) da ta is ongoing, but appears to be rapid and similar 
to the results from the animal studies.  Carfilzomib is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_394309], with an elimination half life of < 60 minutes at the 20 mg/m2 dose.  
Large, single arm studies of the 27 mg/m2 dose are ongoing and suggest that this 
dose is very well tolerated, with patie nts being treated for >[ADDRESS_494889] been enrolled in the PX-171-003-A1 study. The goal of escalating the dose 
to 27 mg/m2, beginning with Cycle 2, is to improve ORR, DOR, and TTP. 
 
In multiple preclinical studies, the tolera bility of carfilzomib in rats has been 
shown to be significantly higher when administered as a 30 min infusion, as compared to a rapid IV bolus.  Toxicities observed with IV bolus injection of carfilzomib above the MTD  at a dose of 48 mg/m
2, include evidence of prerenal 
azotemia (transient increases in BUN > creatinine), as well as lethargy, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657], dyspnea, and gastrointestin al bleeding. Notably, death occurred in 
~50% of animals at 48 mg/m2 when carfilzomib was given as a bolus. 
Administration of the same dose (48 mg/m2) as a [ADDRESS_494890] the reduced C max of carfilzomib vs that with 
bolus dosing.  Inhibition of the pharmacological target of carfilzomib (the 
chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteaso me) was equivalent in the bolus and 
infusion treatment groups.   
 
In the clinic, the MTD of carfilzomib h as not been reached in the MM setting, 
particularly when administered as a 30 minute infusion.  27mg/m2 of carfilzomib 
(bolus administration over 2-10 min.) is  well tolerated in MM patients overall 
and can be tolerated for >12 cycles in late stage MM patients with substantial comorbidities.  
 
A phase I dose escalation study (PX-171-007) of single agent carfilzomib is ongoing, and as of 10 July 2009, over 65 patients with solid tumors had started treatment in the initial Phase II portion of the study at 36 mg/m2 (bolus administration over 2-10 min). A review of the tolerability of 36 mg/m2 
carfilzomib in these patients  indicates that this regimen was very well tolerated, 
with only one DLT (fatigue) and an overall adverse event profile similar to that 
seen with the 27mg/m2 carfilzomib experience with bolus dosing (see IB for details). Three patients completed > 12 cycles of therapy at 36 mg/m2, with no evidence of cumulative toxicity.  There were no significant DLTs observed; the 
majority of discontinuations on the study were due to progressive disease. 
Because of the long-term tolerability carfilzomib, the Phase 1b portion of this 
study was reopened, and a separate arm for MM was added.  
 
MC1185 11 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, [ADDRESS_494891] been treated with 
carfilzomib given as a 30-minute infusion in order to potentially minimize Cmax-
related infusion events. The protocol was amended and doses of 20/36 (20 mg/m2 
given on Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1 only; followed by 36 mg/m2 for all subsequent 
doses), 20/45, 20/56 mg/m2, and so forth, are being investigated.  Doses of 20/56 
mg/m2 are currently being given in two separate cohorts of patients with 
advanced MM and advanced solid tumors ; the lower doses were well tolerated.  
Preliminary tolerability information at this dose level (20/56 mg/m2) have 
indicated that it is reasonably well tolerate d, with minimal infusion reactions.  In 
some cases at 20/56mg/m2, dexamethasone was increased from 4 mg/dose to 8 
mg with the 56 mg/m2 doses, in order to reduce fevers and hypotension.  As of 
March 20, 2010, seven patients  have received 20/56 mg/m2 and are tolerating it.  
Patients with advanced, refractory MM being treated at 36 mg/m2 and 45 mg/m2 
have shown very good tole rability (>6 months in so me cases), with documented 
minimal and partial responses in these heavily pretreated patients. These data indicate that carfilzomib 30-minute infusion can be given at very high levels, with >95% inhibition of blood proteasome levels achievable and with (at least) 
acute tolerability.  All protocols using ≥ 36 mg/m
[ADDRESS_494892] form at the 2009 American Society of Hematology meeting, which demonstrated that carfilzomib can be safely administered  to patients with substantial renal 
impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min, including patients on dialysis), without dose 
adjustment.(Badros, Vij et al. 2009)
  These data indicate that carfilzomib does not 
exacerbate underlying renal dysfunction, and confirms the “pre-renal” etiology of 
the BUN/creatinine elevations observed with IV bolus carfilzomib. 
 
1.9b Study Rationale : Given the existing data, it is reasonable to consider the 
combination of carfilzomib, a new gene ration of proteasome inhibitors, with 
melphalan, as conditioning therapy for autologous stem cell transplant in myeloma. We have designed this phase I/II study of a novel conditioning regimen incorporating multiple anti-myeloma agents for patients with MM undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation.  The phase I portion of the study is designed to determine the MTD of carfilzomib as part of the 
conditioning regimen.  The phase II portion of the study is designed to assess the 
efficacy and toxicity of this approach.

Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018 10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring  
 
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_494918] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web:  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic applications/ctc.htm )    
 
10.[ADDRESS_494919], identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0.  
Next, determine whether the event is e xpected or unexpected (see Section 10.2) 
and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.3).  With this information, determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report (see Secti on 10.4). Expedited re ports are to be 
completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in Sections 
10.4. All AEs reported via expedited mech anisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms define d by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.52 
and 18.0). 
 10.[ADDRESS_494920] Level Term (LLT).   
  
 NOTE:  A severe AE, as defined by [CONTACT_15928], is NOT  
the same as serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
 
10.2  Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
 
 The determination of whether an AE is  expected is based on agent-specific 
information provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol. 
 
 Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent-specific information 
provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol. 
 
NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience that is neither 
identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information provided for IRB 
review nor mentioned in the consent form.  
 
MC1185 26 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018 10.3 Assessment of Attribution 
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s). 
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s). 
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s). 
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event.   
 
10.31 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) on 
the SAME Arm 
 
NOTE:  The combination of an investigatio nal agent with a commercial agent is 
considered investigational.  
 
Routine Reporting  
 
 Routine AE reporting for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies using an 
investigational agent /intervention in combination with a commercial agent 
is stated in the protocol.  See Section 10.52.  
 
NOTE:   When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same 
treatment arm as the investiga tional agent/intervention (also, 
investigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire combination (arm) is 
then considered an investigati onal intervention for reporting. 
 
Expedited Reporting 
 
 An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with 
the guidelines for CTEP investigational ag ents/interventions in Section 10.4, and 
where indicated, an expedited report must be submitted. 
 
 An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigational 
agent/intervention must be assessed as sp ecified in the protocol. In general, 
only Grade [ADDRESS_494921] possible attribution to the commercial agent require an expedited report.  Refer to 
Section 10.4 for specific AE repor ting requirements or exceptions. 
 
 Commercial agent expedited reports mu st be submitted by [CONTACT_394333]. 
 
MC1185 27 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018  An investigational agent/intervention might exacer bate the expected AEs 
associated with a commercial  agent.  Therefore, if an expected AE (for the 
commercial agent) occurs with a higher degree of severity, expedited reporting

11.1 Multiple Myeloma Patients  
 
11.11  Terms and definitions 
 
 Baseline values for disease assessment : All disease response measurements 
will be based on the values obtained at the time of diagnosis if there has been no relapse prior to transplant. If patients had a disease relapse prior to transplant, the baseline values will be those obtained at the time of relapse immediately prior to the transplant. If patient had treatment for the relapsed 
MC1185 33 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, [ADDRESS_494929] indicators of increasing disease and/or end-organ dysfunction that are c onsidered related to the underlying 
plasma cell proliferative disorder: 
1.  Development of new soft tissue plasmacytomas or bone lesions on 
skeletal survey, magnetic resona nce imaging, or other imaging 
2.  Definite increase in the size of existing plasmacytomas or bone lesions. 
A definite increase is defined as a 50% (and at least 1 cm) increase as 
measured serially by [CONTACT_79084]-diameters of 
the measurable lesion 
3.  Hypercalcemia (>11.5 mg/dL; >2.875mM/L) 
4.  Decrease in hemoglobin of more than 2 g/dL (1.25mM) or to less than 10 
g/dL 
5.  Rise in serum creatinine by [CONTACT_117172] 2 mg/dL ( ≥177mM/L) 
6.  Hyperviscosity  NOTE:  If the patient does not meet the IMWG criteria for clinical relapse but the patient has increasing M protein leading to a change in clinical 
management, this will also be consider ed a relapse at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  
 M-protein: synonyms include M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], monoclonal protein and myeloma protein, 
paraprotein, M-component. 
 
Serum M-protein level is quantitated using densitometry on SPEP except in cases where the SPEP is felt to be unreliable.   
 M-proteins migrating in the -region (usually IgA M-proteins)  
 Cases in which the M-protein is so  large and narrow on agarose (some 
specimens >4 g/dL) that they underestimate the actual immunoglobulin level (by [CONTACT_7809] 1500 mg/dL) due to technical staining properties of the agarose gel. 
 Cases in which there are multiple peak s of same M-protein (aggregates or 
dimers) 
 If SPEP is not available or felt to be unr eliable (above examples) for routine M-
protein quantitation, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels derived from nephelometry or turbidometry can be accepte d.  However, this must be explicitly 
reported at baseline, and only nephelometr y can be used for that patient to assess 
response. SPEP derived M-protein valu es and quantitative nephelometric 
immunoglobulin values cannot be used interchangeably.   
 
Urine M-protein measurement is estimated using 24-h UPEP only.  Random or 24 h urine tests measuring kappa and lambda light chain levels are not reliable and are not 
recommended. 
MC1185 34 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018 FLC estimation is currently carried out using the serum FLC assay (Freelite, The 
Binding Site Limited, [LOCATION_006]).  Patients with kappa/lambda FLC ratio <0.26 are defined 
as having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios >1.65 as having a 
monoclonal kappa FLC.  The monoclonal li ght chain isotype is considered the 
involved FLC isotype, and the opposite light chain type as the uninvolved FLC type.  
 
 Response terms:  The following response terms will be used: stringent Complete 
Response (sCR), complete response (CR), ve ry good partial response (VGPR), partial 
response (PR), Minimal Response (MR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease 
(PD).  
 
In addition, for each response category, there will be an “unconfirmed” response 
category, which will be for internal use, for the purpose of guiding decision making and test ordering. These designations will app lied at the time of the first measurement 
at which the quantitative aspect of the response category has been satisfied without the confirmation step having been satis fied. The designation “u” will precede the 
standard abbreviations, and will include usCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR, uPD.  
 
 Measurable disease: Patients who have a measurable serum or urine M-protein.  
 
o Serum M-protein ≥1 g/dl  
o Urine M-protein ≥  200 mg/24 h 
o Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥  10 mg/dl provided serum FLC ratio is 
abnormal 
o Bone marrow plasma cells ≥  30% 
 
The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to 
therapy in patients who have oligo-secretory or non-secretory disease and should be used 
in assessing response only if the baseline serum and/or urine M proteins are not “measurable” as above, and the baseline le vel of the involved FLC is “measurable.”  
When using this assay, it is important to note th at the FLC levels vary considerably with 
changes in renal function and in patients with renal insufficiency, the levels of both the kappa and lambda may remain elevated, but the ratio normalizes with achievement of CR.  Thus, both the level of the involved and the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the involved/uninvolved ratio or involved-uninvol ved difference) should be considered in 
assessing response.  Patients included on the study on the basis of FLC alone (i.e., no 
measurable serum/urine M-protein) should be the only ones who are evaluated using FLC response criteria.  The others should follow usual criteria and ignore FLC results 
with the exception of defining stringent complete response. 
 
 Evaluable disease : Patients who do not have a “measurable” serum M-protein, 
serum free light chain, or urine M-protein. 
 
 Oligosecretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had 
“measurable” serum M-protein or urine M-protein, but has had a detectable M-
protein in his/her serum and/or urine and/or measurable serum free light chain.  
 
MC1185 35 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018  Non-secretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had a 
detectable M-protein in his/her serum and/or urine.

1  SPEP, UPEP, Immunofixation studies of both serum and urine, and Bone marrow 
biopsy  are required to document CR regardless of registration values, and in addition 
FLC  measurement and bone marrow immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_212232].  SPEP and UPEP are required to document VGPR regardless of registration values. 
2  For serum measurable patients, 24 hour ur ine does not need to be confirmed (i.e. 
repeated after documented response) for any response category 
3  At a minimum, a bone marrow biopsy should be repeated every 3 months until 
documented response.  Bone marrow biopsy resu lts do not need to be repeated after 
documented response. 
4    If serum M-protein is being followed by [CONTACT_212269], qua ntitative immunoglobulins are required.  SPEP 
is only required to document CR or VGPR.  
 
11.13 Confirmed response  
 
In order to be classified as a hematologic response, confirmation of serum M- protein, 
serum immunoglobulin free light chain (whe n primary determinant of response) and 
urine M- protein (when primary determinant of response) results must be made by 
[CONTACT_99964].   
 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_128712], 
except for patients with evaluable disease only, where a bone marrow is required 
to document all response categories including progression. However, a second 
confirmatory bone marrow is not required to confirm response in any case. 
MC1185 36 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018  Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements; 
however, if radiographic studies were perfo rmed there should be no evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions. 
 
Appropriate tests required to document and confirm response are listed in Table 11.[ADDRESS_494931] be exercised to avoid rating progression on the basis of variation of radiologic technique alone.  Compression fracture does not exclude continued response and may not indicate progression.  When progr ession is based on skeletal disease alone, it 
should be discussed with the Study Chair befo re removing the patient from the study.

11.5mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to the PC proliferative 
disorder 
Stable Disease (SD) Not meeting criteria for sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR or PD 
 
a All response categories require two consecutive assessments (sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR, PD) made at any time 
before the institution of any new therapy; sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR and SD categories also require no known 
evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic studies are not 
required to satisfy these response requirements. Bone ma rrow assessments need not be confirmed. Each category, 
except for stable disease, will have a working subcategory of “unconfirmed” [prefix ‘u”] to designate first time point 
at which response category MAY have been achieved if confirmed. 
 
b CR patient will need to progress at the same level as VGPR and PR patients to be considered a PD.  A positive 
immunofixation alone is not sufficient. 
 
c If more than one M protein spi[INVESTIGATOR_212233] m easurable disease at baseline, then both need to be 
followed for response.  Otherwise,  only follow the measurable M protein spi[INVESTIGATOR_128717].   
 
d In patients in whom the only measurable disease is by [CONTACT_128758]: CR in such patients indicates a normal 
FLC ratio of 0.26-1.65 in addition to the CR criteria listed above.  
e Bone marrow criteria for PD are only to be used in patients without measurable disease by M protein and by [CONTACT_128759];  
 
f A "25% increase" refers to M protein, FLC and bone marrow results and does not refer to bone lesions, soft tissue 
plasmacytoma or hypercalcemia.  The lowest value does no t need to be a confirmed value.  If the lowest serum M-
protein is ≥ 5 g/dL, an increase in serum M-protein of ≥ 1 g/dL is sufficient to define disease progression. 
 
g In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (for example, a possible lab error), 
that value will not be considered when determining the lowest value.  
h Progressive disease should be confirmed.  However, treatment may be discontinued for progressive disease that is 
unconfirmed per physician discretion.  In this case, an objective status of PD should be entered on the measurement form and progressive disease should be reported on the event monitoring form. 
 
MC1185 38 MCCC Addendum 9

k/l of 4:1 or 1:2.  
 
j  If a patient has already achieved a complete response prio r to registration as a result of the induction therapy or 
stem cell transplant, the patient will be considered a con tinued complete response if they continue to meet the 
complete response criteria at the next assessment.  Reconfirmation of complete response is not required.

and 
•   The first of three consecutive days  with an un-transfused platelet count 
>20,000/mm3.

relapse prior to transplant with no treatment for most recent relapse vs. Disease relapse prior to transplant with treatment for most recent relapse. 
13.0 Treatment/Follow–up Decision at Evaluation of Patient   
 
13.1 Patients who are sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, or SD (or usCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR) will 
continue the conditioning regimen and st em cell transplant per protocol.  
 
MC1185 39 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018  
13.2      Observation:  If the patient has achieved sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, or SD, (or usCR, uCR, 
uVGPR, uPR) at the post-transplant evaluati on, the patient will be observed at [ADDRESS_494933]-transplant and then every 90 days for up to1 year from time of registration.  The follow-up visit may be performed by [CONTACT_394337].  If the patient develops progressive disease or receives subsequent treatment for myeloma while in observation then the pa tient will go to the event-monitoring phase 
per Section 18.0. 
 
13.3 Criteria for Patient Initiation of Event Monitoring 
As of Addendum 8, patient follow-up is no longer required.  
 
Patients will go to event monitoring for the following reasons:  
 Progressive multiple myeloma  
 Subsequent treatment for multiple myeloma 
 Patient withdraws consent to continue in the trial 
 Patient develops an intercurrent illness that precludes further participation, or 
requires a prohibited concomitant treatment 
 The Investigator withdraws the patient in the patient’s best interests 
 Patient is lost to follow-up (defined as the inability to contact [CONTACT_128762] 3 
separate occasions over the course of one year.) 
 Administrative reasons (e.g., the patient is transferred to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677]) 
 An adverse event, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], precludes further trial 
participation  
 
All attempts should be made to complete the End of Study procedures if a patient 
withdraws from the trial early. 
 
13.4 Criteria for Study Discontinuation 
 
The study may be temporarily or permanently discontinued at any site and at any time.  Reasons for study discontinuation may include , but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 Safety concerns 
 Poor enrollment 
 Non-compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidances or other 
regulatory requirements by [CONTACT_737](s) 
 Request to discontinue the trial by a re gulatory or health authority or an IRB 
 Manufacturing difficulties/concerns 
 All Investigators and the requisite regulatory authorities will be notified if the study is 
suspended or terminated for safety reasons.  In the case of such termination, the Investigator will notify the IRB. 
 13.5      Phase I Portion only:  If a patient  fails to complete treatment (conditioning and 
transplant) for reasons other than toxicity, the patient will be regarded as not evaluable 
and will be replaced.

Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018  
13.6 A patient is deemed ineligible  if after registration, it is determined that at the time of 
registration, the patient did not satisfy each a nd every eligibility criteria for study entry.

14.42 HevyLite Assay®: Immunoparesis may be a valuable biomarker of the 
presence of residual malignant disease. However, immunoparesis of 
uninvolved immunoglobulins (Igs) lacks precision. The novel Hevylite™ 
assay measures levels of each distinct Ig subtype (i.e., IgG , IgG, IgA, 
IgA, IgM , and IgM ,) and enables us for the first time to determine if 
suppression of isotype-specific Ig of the opposite LC type is occurring. We have found that suppression of isotype specific M protein (i.e., IgG  
in IgG MGUS) is associated with a si gnificantly increased risk of 
progression in MGUS indicating ability to detect malignant 
phenotype.(Katzmann, Clark et al. 2009) In the studies proposed here, we will determine if suppression of isotype specific Ig level can help identify patients who have persistent MRD. 
 15.0 Drug Information 
 
15.1 Carfilzomib (PR-171, Kyprolis™) 
 
15.11 Background:  Carfilzomib is an analog of epoxomicin and eponemycin; 
a tetrapeptide epoxyketone proteasome i nhibitor that irreversibly binds to 
the N-terminal threonine-containing active sites of the 20S proteasome, 
the proteolytic core particle within the 26S proteasome.  Carfilzomib had antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in vitro in solid and 
hematologic tumor cells.  In animals, carfilzomib inhibited proteasome activity in blood and tissue and delayed tumor growth in models of multiple myeloma, hematologic, and solid tumors.  
 
15.12 Formulation:  Carfilzomib for Injection is supplied as a white to off-
white lyophilized cake or powder in a 60 mg single-use vial.  Upon 
reconstitution, Carfilzomib for Inj ection consists of 2 milligram per 
milliliter (mg/mL) carfilzomib, 100 mg/mL sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBECD), and 1.9 mg/mL citrate buffer (pH3 to 4).  
MC1185 44 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018  
15.13 Preparation and storage :  Unopened vials of carfilzomib are stable 
until the date indicated on the package when stored in the original 
package at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Retain carfilzomib in the original 
package to protect from light. The reconstituted solution contains carfilzomib at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Read the complete preparation instructions prior to reconstitution. 
 
Reconstitution/Preparation Steps : 
1. Remove vial from refrigerator just prior to use. 2. Aseptically reconstitute each vial by [CONTACT_394338] 29 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, directing the solution onto the INSIDE WALL OF THE VIAL to minimize foaming.  Do not use alternative diluents, such as 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, for 
reconstitution.  
3. Gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for about [ADDRESS_494936]. 5. When administering in an intravenous bag, withdraw the calculated dose from the vial and dilute into 50 mL or 100 mL 5% Dextrose 
Injection, USP intravenous bag.  If required, an equivalent volume of 
D5W could be withdrawn prior to dilution of carfilzomib. 
6. Immediately discard the vial containing the unused portion.  Onyx does not have any data to support the use of closed-system drug 
transfer devices other than a standa rd syringe needle, therefore use of 
closed-system drug transfer devices are to be avoided.  However, 
institutions must comply with internal procedures and guidelines for preparation of oncologic drugs when preparing carfilzomib.  Therefore, use of these systems may be required by [CONTACT_394339].  
Prepared IV bags are stable in the refrigerator for 24 hours, or at room 
temperature for 4 hours.  Total time from reconstitution to administration should not exceed 24 hours.  
15.14 Administration:    
Current clinical experience indicates that carfilzomib can be safety administered IV over 2 to10 minutes, or at rates of approximately 10 mL/minute for doses up to 27 mg/m
2; higher doses (>27 mg/m2) are most 
often administered as a 30-minute infusion.  The IV administration line should be flushed with 5% dextrose in water 
or normal saline, immediately before and after carfilzomib 
administration. Carfilzomib should not be administered as a bolus.  
MC1185 45 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018 The dose is calculated using the less of actual or corrected ideal body 
weight (see Appendix IV).  Patients with a BSA greater than 2.2 m2 will 
receive a dose based upon a BSA of 2.2 m2. 
 
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : 
 a)  Absorption – The C max and AUC following a single IV dose of 27 
mg/m2 was 4232 ng/mL and 379 ng•hr/mL, respectively. Following 
repeated doses of carfilzomib at 15 and 20 mg/m2, systemic exposure 
(AUC) and half-life were similar on Days 1 and 15 or 16 of Cycle 1, 
suggesting there was no systemic carfilzomib accumulation. At doses between 20 and 36 mg/m
2, there was a dose-dependent increase in 
exposure. There are no apparent differences in carfilzomib clearance, AUC, and Cmax between subjects with  normal and those with varying 
levels of renal functional impairme nt following single- or repeat-dose 
administration.  b)  Distribution – The mean V
ss of a 20 mg/m2 dose of carfilzomib was 
28 L. When tested in vitro, the binding of carfilzomib to human plasma proteins averaged 97% over the concentration range of 0.4 to 4 micromolar. 
 c)  Metabolism – Carfilzomib was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_380004]. 
The predominant metabolites measured in human plasma and urine, and generated in vitro by [CONTACT_394340], were peptide fragments and the 
diol of carfilzomib, suggesting th at peptidase cleavage and epoxide 
hydrolysis were the principal pathways of metabolism. Cytochrome P450-mediated mechanisms played a minor role in overall carfilzomib 
metabolism. The metabolites have no known biologic activity.  
 d)  Excretion – Following intravenous administration of doses ≥ 15 
mg/m
2, carfilzomib was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_394314] a half-life of ≤ 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycle 1. The systemic clearance 
ranged from 151 to 263 L/hour, and exceeded hepatic blood flow, 
suggesting that carfilzomib was largely cleared extrahepatically. Within 
24 hours following administration of a single 27 mg/m2 IV dose of 
carfilzomib to subjects with multiple myeloma or solid tumors, approximately 30% of the administered dose of carfilzomib was excreted in urine as metabolites.   
  
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions :  Carfilzomib is primarily metabolized via 
peptidase and epoxide hydrolase activ ities. The drug-drug interaction 
potential of carfilzomib is expected to be low. In cultured fresh human 
hepatocytes, carfilzomib did not induce human CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. In a study conducted in subjects with solid tumors (PX-171-008), single 
and repeat dosing of carfilzomib at 27 mg/m2 did not affect the PK of 
midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Together, the in vitro and in vivo results indicate a low potential for carfilzomib to inhibit the metabolism of CYP3A4/5 substrates and other CYP450 substrates in human subjects. Cytochrome P450-mediated mechanisms play a minor role in the overall metabolism of carfilzomib; thus, the potential impact 
of other concomitant medications on ca rfilzomib PK is expected to be 
low. 
 
MC1185 46 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018 Since it is unknown whether carfilzomib is an inducer of CYP2C9 at 
relevant therapeutic concentrations, the current data cannot exclude that 
the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced during carfilzomib 
treatment.  Caution should be observed when carfilzomib is combined 
with medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives.  Carfilzomib is a substrate of efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but 
it only showed marginal inhibitory effect to P-gp at concentrations as 
high as 3 micromoles
 and is not a BCRP substrate. Given that 
carfilzomib is administered IV and is extensively metabolized, the PK 
profile of carfilzomib is unlikely to be affected by P-gp inhibitors or inducers.  
In vitro, carfilzomib does not inhibit OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, 
or BSEP at concentrations up to 3 µM.   The risk of clinically relevant 
interactions with substrates of OATP1B1 and UGT1A1 is low.

16.0  Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
 16.1 Overview:  This is a phase I/II study of a novel conditioning regimen 
incorporating carfilzomib and melphalan for multiple myeloma patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation.  The phase I portion of this study is designed to determine the maximum to lerated dose (MTD) of carfilzomib and 
melphalan conditioning in patients with multiple myeloma.  The phase II portion 
of this study will use a one-stage design to assess the efficacy of carfilzomib and 
melphalan conditioning in patient s with multiple myeloma.   
 
16.11 Endpoint: The primary endpoint of the phase I portion of this trial is to 
assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  For the phase II portion of 
this trial, the primary endpoint is the proportion of complete responses.  
A complete response is defined as a CR noted as the objective status on two consecutive evaluations.  Complete  response will be evaluated using 
all cycles.  Note that a patient may have already achieved a complete response prior to registration from induction therapy.  In this case, a continued complete response will be considered a complete response for the primary endpoint. 
 16.12 Sample Size:  This phase I portion of this study is expected to require a 
minimum of 10 (one patient each at dose levels 0-3 plus 6 patients at dose level 4) and a maximum of 30 (6 patients at each dose level 0-4) evaluable patients.  The 6 patients treated at the MTD in the phase I 
portion will also be included in the phase II portion.  An additional 33 
evaluable patients will be accrued for a maximum of 39 evaluable patients in the phase II portion of this study.  We anticipate accruing 5 additional patients (2 phase I, 3 phase II) to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons.  Therefore, the study is expected to accrue a maximum of [ADDRESS_494943] a maximum of 9 additional evaluable patients to be accrued in 
phase I.  The new overall maximum sample size is 51 patients (14 patients total in phase I + 33 patients in phase II + 4 additional patients to account for patients who are replaced). 
 16.13 Accrual Rate and Study Duration:  The anticipated accrual rate is 2-3 
evaluable multiple myeloma patients per month.  At this rate, it will 
likely take about 2 months (cohort of 1 patient) to 3 months (cohorts of 3 
patients) to enroll, treat, and evaluate each cohort in the phase I portion 
of this study.  The phase I portion is expected to take between 14 and 30 
months.  The phase II portion of this study will accrue in the subsequent 
MC1185 52 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, [ADDRESS_494944] 
cohort of 3 design.  The phase I portion is expected to take an additional 6-9 months.  Therefore, the maximum study duration is expected to be approximately 3 years after Addendum 3 is implemented. 
 
Phase I Portion  
 
16.2 Study Design:  This portion of the study will consist of a phase I trial to 
determine the MTD of carfilzomib and melphalan conditioning.   A two-stage 
accelerated design will be utilized (Simon et al, 1997). The first stage is an 
accelerated dose escalation with a cohort of one patient as in Section 7.32. Once 
one DLT has been observed or ≥[ADDRESS_494945] experienced grade 3+ non-
hematologic toxicities during the first [ADDRESS_494946] cohort of three design as in Section 7.33.   A total of 6 patients will be enrolled and treated at the dose level prior to the one where 
the two DLTs occurred; i.e. at the MTD. 
 
 As of Addendum 4, the phase I study design will be modified to the standard 
cohort of [ADDRESS_494947] cohorts of 3 patients. 
 
16.21 MTD Determination:  MTD is defined as the dose level below the lowest 
dose that induces dose-limiting toxicity in at least one-third of patients 
(at least 2 of a maximum of 6 new patients). See section 7.3 for the MTD determination algorithm and sec tion 7.4 for DLT definitions.

Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018 16.22 Primary Outcome Analyses: 
 
16.221 Adverse Events Profile:  The number and severity of all adverse 
events will be tabulated and summarized in this patient 
population. The grade 3+ adverse events will also be described 
and summarized in a similar fashion. This will provide an indication of the level of tolerance for this treatment combination in this patient group.  
 
16.222 Toxicity Profile:  The term toxicity is defined as adverse events 
that are classified as either po ssibly, probably, or definitely 
related to study treatment.  N on-hematologic toxicities will be 
evaluated via the ordinal CTC standard toxicity grading. 
Hematologic toxicity measures of thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, and leukopenia w ill be assessed using continuous 
variables as the outcome measures (primarily nadir) as well as 
categorization via CTC standard toxicity grading.  Overall toxicity incidence as well as toxicity profiles by [CONTACT_394343]. Frequency 
distributions, graphical techniques and other descriptive measures will form the basis of these analyses.  
 
Phase II Portion  
 
16.3  Statistical Design: 
 
16.31 Decision Rule:  In a Mayo Clinic database study that captured data 
prospectively into a continuously updated database, 178 multiple myeloma patients received a stem cell transplant within 12 months of diagnosis.(Kumar, Lacy et al. 2011)  All of these patients received 
conditioning with single agent melphalan.   The complete response rate to 
stem cell transplant was 35%.  Since patients in this study are expected to 
receive a stem cell transplant within 12 months of diagnosis, an increase in complete response rate to great er than 35% with the addition of 
carfilzomib to melphalan in the conditioning regimen for patients with multiple myeloma would be of interest.  
  The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen 
would be considered ineffective in this population is 35%, and the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population is 55%.  The following 
one-stage binomial design uses [ADDRESS_494948] 35%.    16.311 Final Decision Rule:  If [ADDRESS_494949] 39 evaluable patients, we may 
recommend further testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this population. 
MC1185 54 MCCC Addendum 9  
Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018  
16.312 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are 
accrued, the additional patients w ill not be used to evaluate the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_349639].  Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in Section 16.44. 
 
16.32 Power and Significance Level:  Assuming that the number of successes 
is binomially distributed, the significance level is .10, i.e. there is a 10% 
chance of finding the drug to be effective when it truly is not.  The 
probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further study (i.e. statistical power) under various success proportions can be tabulated as a function of the true success proportion as shown in the following table. 
 
If the true success proportion is... 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 
Then the probability of declaring that the regimen warrants further study is… 0.10 0.27 0.50 0.74 0.90 
 
16.33 Other considerations:  Adverse even ts, quality/duration of response, and 
patterns of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific 
discoveries or changes in standard car e will be taken into account in any 
decision to terminate the study 
 
16.4 Analysis Plan 
 
16.41 Primary Outcome Analyses: 
 
16.411 Definition:  The primary endpoint in the phase II portion of this 
trial is the proportion of complete responses.  A complete response is defined as a CR noted as the objective status on two 
consecutive evaluations.  Complete response will be evaluated using all cycles.  Note that a patient may have already achieved a complete response prior to registration as a result of the induction therapy.  In this case, a continued complete response will be considered a complete response for the primary endpoint.  
All patients meeting the eligib ility criteria who have signed a 
consent form and have begun tr eatment will be evaluable for 
response.

complete response rate at day [ADDRESS_494952] had tumor progression at 
the time of their death unless there is sufficient documented evidence to conclude no progression occurred prior to death.  
The distribution of time to progression will be estimated using 
the method of Kaplan-Meier.(Kaplan and Meier 1958)  The progression-free rate at 1 year and 2 years will be assessed. 
 16.425 Adverse Events:  All eligible patients that have initiated 
treatment will be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s).  The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns.   Additionally, the relationship 
of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into 
consideration.

 16.432   The HevyLite assay will be assessed prior to treatment, at the 
end of cycle 3 (day 100), and at the time of suspected CR.  Patients will be categorized by [CONTACT_394344] (yes vs. no) and uninvolved immunoglobulin suppressed (yes vs. no) at each time point.  The correlation of these 
categories with whether MRD is present (yes vs. no) will be 
evaluated using Fisher’s exact test.   In addition, the relationship between these categories and time to progression will be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier met hods and log-rank statistics.  
Due to the limited sample size, these analyses will be considered 
exploratory. 
 
16.44 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to  evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_128725]; however, they will be included in final endpoint estimates and confidence intervals.

Protocol Version Date:   August 16, 2018 16.5 Data & Safety Monitoring: 
 
16.51 The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the 
study at least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any 
endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monito ring Board (DSMB) is responsible 
for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_31959]. 
 
16.52 Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] (includes all phase II patients, including 
phase I patients treated at the MTD):   The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_394316].  We note that the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_357684] (1) the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the 
conduct of the trial and in consider ation of newly acquired information 
regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under 
investigation.  The study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below. 
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we 
observe events considered at least po ssibly related to study treatment (i.e. 
an adverse event with attribute speci fied as  “possible,” “probable,” or 
“definite”) that satisfy one of the following: 
 
 if [ADDRESS_494954] possibly related to 
treatment. 
 
 if after the first [ADDRESS_494955] been treated, 40% of all patients experience a grade [ADDRESS_494956] possibly related to treatment.  
 
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related” , to verify their attribution and to 
monitor the emergence of a previ ously unrecognized treatment-related 
adverse event. 
 
16.6   Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov:  At study activation, this study will have 
been registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and 
Secondary Endpoints along with other required information for this study will be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov. For purpo ses of timing of the Results Reporting, 
the initial estimated completion date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 4.5 
years after the study opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint 
Completion Date” (PECD) for this study is at the time the last patient registered has been followed for at least 6 months. 
 16.7 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
 
16.71 This study will be available to all eligible patients, regardless of race, 
gender, or ethnic origin.

16.73 The geographical region served  by [CONTACT_128776] a population which 
includes approximately 3% minorities.  Based on prior MCCC 
studies involving similar disease si tes, we expect about 3-5% of 
patients will be classified as mi norities by [CONTACT_31961] 33% of 
patients will be women. Expected sizes of racial by [CONTACT_394345]:

Chemotherapy Dosing Information 
 
Principle:  Use the lesser of actual or corrected  ideal body weight (CIBW) for all 
chemotherapy dosing. 
 
For patients who are overweight, a corrected ideal body weight should be calculated and used to calculate 
chemotherapy doses. Ideal body weight (IBW) can be calculated as follows:  
1. Males: IBW = 50 kg + (2.3 x number of inches over 5 feet)  
2. Females: IBW = 45.5 kg + (2.3 x number of inches over 5 feet)  
 
The corrected ideal body weight can then be calculated by [CONTACT_51632]:  
1. Corrected IBW = IBW +0.25 (actual body weight - IBW)  
 
 The lesser of actual or corrected ideal body weight is then used in the Gehan and George BSA formula to 
calculate carfilzomib and melphalan dosing 
 
The Gehan and George formula 
BSA (m²) = 0.0235 x Height(cm)0.[ZIP_CODE] x Weight(kg)0.[ZIP_CODE]

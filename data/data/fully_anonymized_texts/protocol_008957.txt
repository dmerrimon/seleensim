 mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) with 
baseline HbA1c as a covariate will be fitted  on the available data, incorporating all visits at 
which HbA1c was measured  from each subject including  the scheduled visits at weeks 2, 6, 
and 12 as well as the unscheduled visits for measurement of HbA1c . Treatment , study center,  
and stratification factor for randomization (treatment naïve versus  taking one OHA  at 
baseline)  will be applied as fixed effects, as will study week  and study week -by-treatment 
interaction. From this model, an estimate of the treatment difference at week [ADDRESS_1204409] estimates in the presence of 
missing data. As sensitivity analyses for missing data, the following will be performed:  
1. Missing HbA1c data (for weeks 2, 6, or 12) will be imputed via multiple imputation , 
following which the MMR M will be repeated on the complete datasets with results 
combined across complete datasets using standard MI techniques; HbA1c values 
collected after the start of rescue medication will be considered missing.  
2. Missing HbA1c data will be imputed via LOCF, fo llowing which the MMRM will be 
repeated; HbA1c values collected after the start of rescue medication will be considered 
missing.  
3. HbA1c values collected after the start of rescue medication will NOT be considered 
missing , and the MMRM analyses will be re -performed.  
 
The effect of bexagliflozin on fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, body weight, change in 
HbA1c over time , and proportion of subjects who reach HbA1c <  7% will be evaluated as 
secondary endpoints. These endpoints are considered exploratory and will not be adjusted for 
multiplicity.  
Safety and tolerability of bexagliflozin in subjects with T2DM will also be assessed  
descriptively.  Data summaries will be produced for AEs, physical exam results, vital signs, 
ECG results, and clinical lab results including serum chemistry, hematology, serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], 
glycemic control parameters and urinalysis.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality 
worldwide, affecting an estimated 38 7 million people in 201 4 and reaching  epi[INVESTIGATOR_863754] .  Approximately 1 79 million of those affected 
are estimated to be  unaware of their condition and over 80% reside in low - and middle -
income countries (International Diabetes Foundation, 2014).  T2DM accounts for at least 
90% of all diab etes cases . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_532513], the 
number of people with T2DM  is projected to increase by 55% to over 590 million adults by 
2035.  Among the debilitating consequences of T2DM are peripheral neuropathy, 
retinopathy,  renal failure, peripheral ischemia and exacerbations of cardiovascular disease, 
which result in blindness, amputation, dialysis and death.  
T2DM is a disease of insulin resistance  and is strongly linked to increased body fat mass  in 
the majority of cases (Schwartz et al., 2012 ).  Weight loss has been shown to improve 
glycemic control and to reduce the severity of diabetes -associated comorbidit ies, supporting 
the view that anti -diabetic agents that promote weight loss may be particularly beneficial for 
the treatment of the disease  (Look et al., 2013 ; Scheen and Van Gaal, 2014 ).   
Asian populations may be par ticularly at risk for the adverse consequences of increased body 
mass. Metabolic syndrome, a presentation  of diabetes with comorbid hypertension and 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], increases more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_863755] -
Asians and it has b een proposed that the BMI ranges that define the overweight and obese 
categories should be lower in Asian populations than in non -Asian populations (Palaniappan 
et al., 2011 ).  
Several classes of agents are available for treating T2DM, including insulin and its 
secretagogues, PPAR  agonists, biguanides, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, glucagon -like 
peptide 1 (GLP -1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors.  However, 
the rapid growth rate in the incidence of T2DM has led to an increasing recognition that 
addition al therapeutics are needed to provide safe and effective reductions of elevated plasma 
glucose levels.  New agents to treat T2DM will ideally reduce  hyperglycemia and avoid 
common side effects of currently available agents, such as weight gain, gastrointes tinal 
disturbance s, and hypoglycemia.  
The renal Na+/glucose transport protein SGLT2 actively transports extracellular glucose into 
cells using the driving energy of the transmembrane electrochemical potential for sodium 
ions.  Individuals with disruptions in SLC5A2, the gene encoding SGLT2, exhibit prominent 
glucosuria in the absence of significant co -morbidities (Santer et al., 2003 ; van den Heuvel et 
al., 2002 ).  The excretion of glucose in the urine  of diabetic subjects in amounts comparable 
to or greater than that seen in individuals harboring loss of functions mutations in SLC5A2 
has the potential to improve both fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia without increasing 
insulin secretion, causing w eight gain, or inducing hypoglycemia.

 1.1 Bexagliflozin  for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  
Bexagliflozin  (previously identified as  EGT0001442) , is a potent and  highly specific 
inhibitor of the SGLT2 with an in vitro  IC50 of 2 nM  or 0.9 ng/mL and a [ADDRESS_1204414] observable dose level in male rats, as well as signs of reversible 
cardiac inflammation and abdominal distension at a dose level of 200 mg/kg  in monkeys.  
Details of the adverse findings are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.1.2  Summary of Clinical Data with Bexagliflozin  
Theracos has completed eight phase 1 studies to evaluate safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics  (PK), pharmacodynamics (P D) and drug metabolism in healthy subjects, 
subjects with T2DM, and diabetic subjects with renal impairment.  Details of the 
pharmacology, efficacy, and safety assessments are described in the Investigator’s Brochure 
and summarized in the following sections . 
Bexagliflozin  exhibits high permeability and is a weak Pgp substrate and inhibitor.  It 
produces dose -proportional exposures in humans and animals.   Metabolism in humans is 
most similar to that in monkeys, and the principal pathway for biotransformation in humans 
is glucuronide formation.  The majority of bexagliflozin  and related metabolites are excreted 
within [ADDRESS_1204415] been used in  the initial clinical 
pharmacology and phase 2 studies.  A program to develop a n extended  release tablet  
formulation that would reduce daily variation in the concentration of the compound was 
carried out and resulted in the identification of a mucoadhesive for mulation with the desired 
properties. The drug products exhibit a greater than 75% release of drug substance by 8 h  in 
simulated gastric fluid in vitro .

 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
THR -1442 -C-449 is a phase 2b multicenter, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose range 
finding  study to assess the efficacy and safety of once daily bexagliflozin  in either treatment -
naïve type 2 diabetic subjects or subjects previously treated with one oral hypoglycemic  
agent  (OHA) .  The primary efficacy endpoint will be placebo -adjusted re duction in HbA1c , 
measured after [ADDRESS_1204416] received no more than 14 days 
of prescription medications for diabetes in the 12 weeks pr ior to enrollment.  The study will 
enroll men and women  with T2DM and with HbA1c between 7% and 8 .5% (inclusive) at the 
screening visit (for subjects who are treatment naïve ) or with T2DM and with HbA1c 
between 6.5% and 8 .5% (inclusive) at screening visit (for subjects who have received one 
OHA  and who are willing and able to undergo a washout period. )   
Approximately 4 00 subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion 
criteria, and who consent to participate in the study are eligible to  be enrolled to complete  a 6 
to 10 week washout if needed and a 2 week placebo run -in period prior to being randomized.  
Subjects who can adhere to the  run-in medication dosing schedule (i.e., miss no more than 
one dosage  in 2 weeks ) and who have HbA1c between 7 and 8 .5% at baseline (visit S5) will

on two consecutive days during the wash -out period.  
Eligible subjects who  are treatment naïve will not require a washout period and will proceed 
to the run -in period.  These subjects will be provided with diet and exercise counseling , a 
glucometer, and a glycemic control diary in which to record daily fasting SMBG 
measurements at the start of the [ADDRESS_1204418] will be provided with

taken daily in the morning prior to eating or drinking; the medication should  be taken with 
water.  
Subjects will not be eligible for randomization if during the run -in period they: 1) have 
fasting blood glucose values ≥  250 mg /dL on two or more consecutive days, 2) omit more

to the occurrence of hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic events will be recorded.  The 
investigational products  will be orally administered in the morning prior to eating or 
drinking; the medication should  be taken with water.  Rescue medication for hyperglycemia 
will be  allowe d when deemed medically necessary by [CONTACT_093] . 
Each subject will be instructed to return to the clinic at weeks 2, 6, and 1 2 for safety and 
efficacy evaluations including revie w of adverse events and concomitant medication s, vital 
signs, ECG, physical examination, and blood and urine specimen collection s.  On the day of 
the clinic visit a minimum fasting period  of 10 hours  (h) must be confirmed prior to blood 
draw.  
Subjects will return to the clinic for a follow -up exit visit at week [ADDRESS_1204421].  
3.2.3  Glycemic Control Monitoring  
WASHOUT AND PLACEBO RUN-IN PERIODS  
During the washout and placebo run -in period subjects will be in structed to determine SMBG 
daily after fasting overnight for a minimum  of 10  h.  If the fasting blood glucose is ≥ 250 
mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) the subject should contact [CONTACT_614761] [ADDRESS_1204422] withdraw  from the study and initiate a 
more intense pharmacological regimen for glucose control.  The participant will be excluded 
from further participation if fasting blood glucose  values are ≥250 mg/dL prior to 
randomization  on [ADDRESS_1204423] the clinic if any fasting SMBG is ≥  270 mg/dL (15 
mmol/L) from wee k 1 to week 6 or  ≥ 240 mg/dL  (13.3 mmol/L) from  week 6 to week 12.  
Fasting b lood glucose values collected via SMBG will be evaluated at study visits by [CONTACT_1275]. In addition, hyperglycemia will be monitored by [CONTACT_863766].

Prescription of Rescue Medication).  
If a concomitant medication for hyperglycemia is to be prescribed, a sample must be drawn 
prior to the administra tion of the rescue medication so that a final HbA1c value  can be 
ascribed to the latest date upon which  the sub ject was taking investigational product  as the 
sole therapy . 
PRESCRIPTION OF RESCUE MEDICATION  
Rescue medication for hyperglycemia should be pres cribed by [CONTACT_863767] -being of the subject.  During the 12 week  treatment  period , 
a review of diet and exercise counseling is suggested prior to prescription of rescue 
medication in the absence of specif ic medical indications for rescue medication.  Rescue 
medication is suggested if, after a review of diet and exercise counselling:  
1. more than 3 consecutive, daily, fasting SMBG measures are ≥ 270 mg/dL (15 mmol/L) 
from week 1 to week 6, or ≥ 240 mg/dL ( 13.3 mmol/L) from week 6 to week 12  
2. fasting SMBG values are ≥ 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L)  and associated with clinical signs 
or symptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g . weight loss, blurred vision, increased thirst, or 
increased urination, or fatigue), and the signs  or symptoms are severe  
 
The investigator may provide rescue treatment with any approved medication for diabetes 
that is not otherwise contraindicated, with the exception of an SGLT2 inhibitor, as study 
subjects may already be taking a drug in that class a s a consequence of being randomized to 
receive bexagliflozin .  
Subjects who receive rescue medication due to poor glycemic control will continue to receive 
investigational product  and standard of care per investigator decision, according to current 
treatme nt guidelines.  Following the exit visit subjects will be advised to see their primary 
physician to undergo  treatment to control their diabetes.  
If hypoglycemia occurs in any subject prescribed rescue medication for hyperglycemia 
during the study, the total  daily dose of the rescue medication should be reduced 50% or 
more at the discretion of the investigator.

MAJOR  ADVERSE  CARDIOVASCULAR  EVENT  ADJUDICATION  
An independent cardiovascular adjudication committee has been  established to review , under

include cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction  (MI) , stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_532542], urgent revascularization procedures, and other possible serious 
cardiova scular events.  The adjudicated events will be documented and archived to allow a 
meta -analysis to be performed at a later time.  No separate cardiovascular risk assessment 
will be performed based on events in the study population of the current protocol.

Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1204426]’s HbA1c level at [ADDRESS_1204427] 2 weeks prior to 
randomization to allow  compliance with the dosing regimen to be monitored.  Subjects with 
FPG levels  ≥ 250 mg/dL at rand omization will be excluded as a safety measure.  Diet and 
exercise counseling will be provided to all participating subjects to reduce risks of worsening 
diabetic conditions  or prolonged hyperglycemia.  
Results from published data in individuals with geneti c mutations in SLC5A2 , the gene 
encoding SGLT2, and in subjects that have been treated with other SGLT2 inhibitors, and 
from previous clinical studies in healthy or diabetic subjects treated with bexagliflozin , 
indicate that the risk of induced hypoglycemi a as a consequence of the loss of SGLT2 
activity should be minimal.  
Reduction in HbA1c directly reflects improvement in glycemic control and is a well 
validated surrogate for the risk of long-term microvascular complications of T2DM . HbA1c 
reflects mean gl ycemic control over [ADDRESS_1204428], a baseline HbA1c value of 7% to 8 .5% is included in  this pr otocol to 
allow clinical dose selection. N ear maximal glucosuria should be safe for the treatment of 
minimal diabetes  since hypoglycemia has never occurred  in trials with healthy subjects .

5.6 Concomitant Therapy  
Subjects will be allowed to take medications or medicinal supplements prescribed to manage 
non-diabetic medical conditions during the study.  Any concurrent medication or 
supplement al treatment of other, non -diabetes, medical conditions should be continued at a 
stable dose and frequency for the entire study duration unless there is a clinical reason to 
change the dose or frequency.  
During the r un-in period, blood pressure medications can be altered to optimize blood 
pressure control at the discretion of the investigator. Blood pressure medications should not 
be altered during the treatment period unless it is medically necessary to do so.  If it is 
medically necessary to alter blood pressure medications during the treatment period, new 
diuretic medications should not be initiated and the dose and frequency of existing diuretic 
medications should not be altered.

4. Urinalysis wi ll be collected routinely at all clinic visits  except S3 and V1 from a clean catch 
sample. Glucose results in the urinalysis reports  must be suppressed so the dosing blind can be 
maintained.  Testing strips with only the leucocytes and nitrate will be provided for immediate 
assessment at the clinical sites.  
5. Urine drug screen will be performed on screening visit only. Drug abuse screening includes 
amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine metabolites, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and cannabinoids.   
6. Infectious di sease testing will b e conducted at screening only.  
7. Urine pregnancy test  (UPT)  will be performed for WOCBP at all clinic v isits, except Visit s S3 
and V1. For surgically sterile or post - menopausal women, it will only be done at Visit S1.

6.7.2  Sample Collection, Storage, and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hematology, Blood Chemistry, Serum Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and Glycemic Control 
Assessments  
Blood samples for hematology, chemistry, serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_272208].  Timing of collection is described in Section 7  and the Schedule of Events 
(see Appendix 1  and Appendix 2 ). 
The study staff will contact [CONTACT_863772] a scheduled clinic visit to confirm the time 
of the visit and to remind the su bject of the proper fasting  procedure .  A subject must be 
queried to assess compliance with a minimum [ADDRESS_1204457] return as soon as can be arranged (within 7 days) to provide a 
specimen after proper fasting.  If the 10  h fasting sample is not collected within 7 days of the 
initially scheduled visit, the FPG will be considered missing.  
6.7.3  Urinalysis  
Urine samples will be collected per the schedule outlined in  Section 7 .  
Investigator or staff should document if pre -menopausal female subjects are menstruating 
and note it in the source documents since hematuria is likely to be identified on dipstick 
urinalysis.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be determined as described in the vital signs section 
(Section 6.4).  
6.10 Adverse Events Assessments  
Adverse event (AE ): Any untoward medical occurrence experienced by  a subject 
administered a n investigational  product . An AE  does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended accident, 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease occurring during the 
period of use of a n investigational p roduct  or the period of follow -up, whether or not related 
to the investigational product.  
Serious adverse event (SAE ): Any event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. A life-threatening event, i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_90554], at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (this does not include an event that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death)  
3. A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
4. An event that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_863760]  
5. A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6. Any o ther medically significant events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may harm the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes list ed above, e.g. allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Non-serious adverse events are all  events that do not meet the criteria for a serious adverse 
event.  
Immediately Reportable Adverse Event (IRAE):  Any serious adverse event or any 
adverse event that necessitates discontinuation of investigational product , including 
pregnancy.  
Clinical Laboratory Changes:  It is the investigator’s responsibility to review the results of 
all laboratory tests as they become available.  For each abnormal laboratory test result  the 
investigator needs to ascertain if this is a clinically significant change fro m baseline for that 
individual subject ( this determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the 
first time an abnormal value is observed.  The investigator may repeat the laboratory test or 
request additional tests to verify the results of th e original laboratory tests).  If the laboratory 
Bexagliflozin tablets   Theracos, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1204460], this is considered an AE.  
Hypoglycemia is defined as any FPG or SMBG value ≤ 70 mg/d L and documented as 
described in Section 6. 10.9. 
Any increase in liver function tests (AST, ALT, or bilirubin) greater than [ADDRESS_1204461] 
for the laboratory utilized will be considered a  clinical  laboratory adverse event.  
Severity: Adverse events will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported as indicated on the 
CRF.  The intensity of an adverse experience is defined as follows:  
1 = Mild: discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily act ivity;  
2 = Moderate:  discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity;  
3 = Severe: inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
Investigational Product  Causality: An assignment made by [CONTACT_272262].  Cases with causal relationship classified as 
possible , probable  or definite are defined  as related. Cases with causal relationship 
categorized as not likely or unrelated are defined  as not related.   Relationship of an adverse 
event to dosing will be assessed as follows:  
Definite:  The event responds to withdrawal of the investigational product  (dechallenge), and 
recurs with rechallenge by [CONTACT_272263] . 
Probable:  There is a reasonable causal relat ionship between the investigational product  and 
the AE.  The event responds to dechallenge. Rechallenge is not required.  
Possible:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product  and 
the AE.  Dechallenge is lacking or unclear.  
Not Likely : There is a temporal relationship to investigational product  administration, but 
there is not a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product  and the 
event.  
Unrelated:  There is not a temporal or causal relationship to inves tigational product  
administration.  
6.10.1  Eliciting and Reporting Adverse Events  
The investigator will periodically assess subjects for the occurrence of adverse events.  To 
avoid bias in collecting information about adverse events, the investigator should ask 
subjects the following question: "How have you felt since you were last checked?"  All 
adverse events (serious and non -serious) reported by [CONTACT_698066].

 In addition, the sponsor ’s Medical Monitor or its designated personnel must be notified 
immediately by [CONTACT_756] , email,  or fax of any immediately reportable adverse events 
(IRAE)_ according to  the procedure outlined below.  Special attention should be paid to 
recording hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34910].  
6.10.[ADDRESS_1204462] report any serious adverse event (SAE), by [CONTACT_756], email, or fax, to 
Theracos or its representative immediately after the investigator becomes aware of the event.  
An SAE form should be completed and sent by [CONTACT_863774] [ADDRESS_1204463]  (including 
laboratory abnormalities) should be reported to Theracos within [ADDRESS_1204464].  
6.10.3  Pregnancy  
Women of childbearin g potential (WOCBP) who are sexually active must use an effective 
method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is 
minimized.   
Before enrolling WOCBP in this clinical trial, investigators must review guideli nes about 
study participation for WOCBP.  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_78609]:  
1. General information  
2. Informed consent form  
3. Pregnancy prevention information  
4. Drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives.  
5. Contraceptives in current use.  
6. Guidelines for the fo llow-up of a reported pregnancy.  
 
Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.  The 
subject  must sign an informed consent form stating the above -mentioned risk factors and that 
the consequences were discussed with her.  
During the study, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_397924] (e.g. missed or late menstrual cycle).  
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to investigational 
product  administration, the investigational product  administration must be withheld until the 
Bexagliflozin tablets   Theracos, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1204465] will be withdrawn from the trial.  [Exceptions to study discontinuation may be 
considered for life -threatening conditions only after consultations with a Theracos Medical 
Monitor or designated personnel.]  
The investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of any female subject who 
becomes pregnant within [ADDRESS_1204466] unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] ( e.g., x-ray studies).   Other appropriate  
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the 
investigator must report to Theracos, on the appropriate Pregnancy Surveillan ce form(s), 
follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and 
neonatal outcome.  Infants will be followed for a minimum of six months.  
6.10.[ADDRESS_1204467]’s treatment is 
required for clinical care and safety.  The Emergency Code Break module in the IWRS is 
used for such situations.   The investigator must confirm the intention to un blind the subject’s 
treatment to obtain the dose information in IWRS .  Upon completion of the unblinding, the 
system will send an alert to designated study team members that an unblinding event has 
occurred.  Documentation of breaking the blind should be r ecorded in the subject’s medical 
record with the date and time the blind was broken, and the names of the personnel 
requesting and authorizing unblinding.   The treatment assignment will continue to be 
withheld from the cardiovascular adjudication committee  members until all phase 3 studies 
are completed.  
6.10.5  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Non -serious Adverse Events  
Non-serious AEs that are identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_863775].  All non -serious AEs that are ongoing at the time will be 
recorded as ongoing on the CRF.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Post -Study Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs  that are identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_863776] 6. 10.2.  
These may include unresolved previously reported SAEs , or new SAEs.  The investigator 
should follow these SAEs  until the  events are resolved, or the subject  is lost to follow -up.  
Resolution means the subject  has returned to the baseline state of health, or the investigator 
does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition.  The 
investigator sho uld continue to report any significant follow -up information to Theracos  until 
the event has been resolved.   
Any new SAEs  reported by [CONTACT_863777], and are determined by [CONTACT_863778] , should be reported to the Theracos or designated personnel .  This 
may include SAEs  that are captured on follow -up telephone contact [CONTACT_863779] d (i.e., up to last scheduled contact).  The investigator should 
follow SAEs identified after the last scheduled contact [INVESTIGATOR_201170], or the 
subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator should continue to report any significant 
follow -up information to the sponsor  until the event has been resolved.  This study requires 
that subjects  be actively monitored for SAEs at least [ADDRESS_1204468] Infections  (UTIs) 
Events potentially representing UTIs,  including  cystitis, urethritis, pyelonephritis, or 
urosepsis , should be carefully evaluated and documentation of signs, symptoms, culture 
results for infectious agent, and treatment should be undertaken  when appropriate .  
The investigator should query the subject a t every clinical visit for symptoms that may be 
related to a UTI and, if appropriate, document these events as symptomatic UTI in the CRF  
unless an alternative diagnosis is present . In addition, a clean catch urine sample will be 
obtained at all clinical v isits and a urinalysis will be performed on that sample at every 
clinical visit. A positive urinalysis will be defined as one with detectable leukocyte esterase 
and/or nitrites. If the subject reports symptoms consistent with a UTI or the urinalysis at the  
clinical site is positive, a urine culture will be performed at the central laboratory. A positive 
urine culture will be defined as one with ≥ 105 CFU of any species. The investigator may also 
perform a urine culture using local resources if necessary for  clinical care.  
6.10.7  Genital Mycotic Infections (GMI s) 
The investigator will query the subjects for signs or symptoms that may represent a  GMI  at 
all clinical visits . GMI s will be diagnosed based on symp toms and , if appropriate, physical 
exam and  laboratory fi ndings . Investigators must exclude the possibility of  sexually 
transmitted infection s before diagnosing GMI . Diagnosis of GMIs must be documented in 
the CRF.

abnormality; the type, frequency, and dose of any concurrent medications or supplements 
taken by [CONTACT_11766] 14 days of the detected abnormality; and any symp toms or 
change in physical exam that have occurred since the prior assessment.   The investigator 
should perform additional laboratory and imaging tests to attempt to establish the cause of 
the AST and ALT elevations, including ruling out any potential cont ribution from bone or 
muscle etiologies.  
Any clinically significant increase in hepatic enzymes and specifically any ALT or AST >3x 
ULN requires immediate repeat test within [ADDRESS_1204471] every 96 h (4 days) 
until ALT and AST return to < 2.[ADDRESS_1204472].  Study medication should be stopped  and the 
event should be reported as a laboratory adverse event within the CRF if the enzyme 
elevation is confirmed or worsening.  
Hepatotoxicity will be diagnosed and entered as an AE should any of the following occur:  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1204473];  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1204474] and total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1204475] or INR > 1.5  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1204476] with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%).  
 
In the event of hepatotoxicity, investigational prod uct should be permanently discontinued.  
The investigator is encouraged to consult with the Medical Monitor regarding diagnostic 
evaluation for the hepatic enzyme elevations.  Consultation with a hepatologist may also be 
appropriate in some circumstances.  
6.10.[ADDRESS_1204477] in the glycemic control diary the following 
information for each hypoglycemic event:  
Bexagliflozin tablets   Theracos, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1204478] recent meal to the onset  of  signs and symptoms  
4. Duration, intensity, and type of any exercise within the 24 h prior to th e signs and 
symptoms  
5. Type of treatment used (e.g., juice, crackers) for the signs and symptoms and whether 
assistance was required from another person to administer the treatment  
6. SMBG reading 15 minutes after treatment with carbohydrate and the time at whi ch this 
was measured  
7. Whether or not the signs and symptoms attributed to hypoglycemia resolved after blood 
glucose returned to normal . 
 
Subjects are encouraged to call the study clinic should signs and symptoms potentially 
related to hypoglycemia occur.  
At each study visit, the investigator is expected to review the glucometer and glycemic 
control diary with particular attention to any SMBG value ≤ 70 mg/d L and any recorded 
signs or symptoms potentially related hypoglycemia.  In addition, the investigator sh ould 
query the subject with regard to the occurrence of signs and symptoms potentially related to 
hypoglycemia even if none are recorded in the diary.  
In the event of a blood glucose value ≤ 70 mg/d L or signs and symptoms potentially related 
to hypoglycem ia, the investigator should complete the supplemental CRF which will include 
data from the glycemic control diary and action items to reduce future hypoglycemia 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
Hypoglycemia events will be recorded in the hypoglycemia log under 5 categories:  
1. Severe hypoglycemia: an event requiring assistance by [CONTACT_272269], glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.  These epi[INVESTIGATOR_272210].  Plasma glucose 
meas urements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery 
attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient 
evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.   All such 
events should be recorded as serious adverse events in the CRF.  
2. Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia: an event during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_272211] a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤ 70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L).  
3. Asymp tomatic hypoglycemia: an event not accompanied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_78237] a measured blood glucose concentration ≤ 70 mg/dL (3.9 
mmol/L).  
4. Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia 
are not accompani ed by a blood glucose determination but that is presumably caused by a 
blood glucose concentration ≤ 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).  
Bexagliflozin tablets   Theracos, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -1442 -C-449  16 February 2015  
   
 
Confidential  Page 42 of 65 
 5. Relative hypoglycemia: An event during which the person with diabetes reports any of 
the typi[INVESTIGATOR_10921], and interprets those as indicative of 
hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma glucose concentration > 70 mg/dL (3.9 
mmol/L).  
 
While each event meeting the criteria above will be entered into the hypoglycemia log, only 
critical hypoglycemia, documented symptom atic hypoglycemia, asymptomatic 
hypoglycemia, and probable hypoglycemia will be entered as AEs.  
In the event of asymptomatic hypoglycemia, the investigator should review the signs and 
symptoms of hypoglycemia with the subject to elicit a complete descript ion and should 
review proper glucometer technique to ensure that the low glucose value is not due to 
improper use of the glucometer.  
The investigator should be alert to the likelihood of improper glucose measurement technique 
if a study subject reports  an SMBG value < 55 mg/d L that is not associated with any signs or 
symptoms of hypoglycemia and is not treated by [CONTACT_863780].   
In the event of probable symptomatic hypoglycemia, the investigator should encourage the 
subject to obtain glucose values, when possible, in the context of signs and symptoms of 
hypoglycemia, even if the glucose value is measured after treatment for the symptoms  is 
administered.  
If hypoglycemia occurs in any subject prescribed rescue medication for hyperglycemi a 
during the study, the total daily dose of the rescue medication should be reduced 50% or 
more at the discretion of the investigator.

Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
6.13 Appropriateness  of Measurements  
The percentage of HbA1c is a widely used measure of chronic glycemia, reflecting average 
blood glucose levels over a 2 - to 3-month period of time. It is an accepted surrogate marker 
for risk of microvascular complications and is widely used as a measuremen t for the 
adequacy of glycemic management. Other study procedures and measurements in this 
protocol are widely used and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant for 
subjects with T2DM.

 9 PLANNED STATISTICAL  METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations  
All statistical analyses will be performed using Version 9.4 or later of Statistical Analy sis 
Software (SAS®). 
Data summaries will use descriptive statistics (number of subjects [n], mean, standard 
deviation [SD], Q1, median, Q3, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables, and 
frequency and percentage for categorical and ordinal variables.  If there are missing values, 
the number missing will be presented, but without a percentage .   All data collected will be 
included in by -subject data listings.  
Unless otherwise specified, all tests will be two -tailed using a 0.05 level of significance.  All 
confidence intervals (CIs) will be two -sided 95% confidence intervals.     
9.1.[ADDRESS_1204487].  But if m issing data are present f or the 
primary efficacy endpoint , they will be handled using  a multiple imputation approach.   The 
imputation method is as follows:  
As the primary analysis, o nly available data will be analyzed and data obtained after res cue 
will be  excluded and considered as missing.    The following sensitivity analyses will be 
conducted:  
• Missing endpoint information (including data obtained after rescue) will be imputed  via 
multiple imputation linear  regression approach. A total of 10 imputed datasets will be 
generated, and the primary efficacy endpoint analysis described below will be carried out 
on each imputed dataset; the analyses results will be combined across the [ADDRESS_1204488] techniques for multiple  imputed data sets in order to yield overall 
treatment comparison result s on the imputed data . 
• Missing endpoint data will also be handled based on the last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) technique.  T he last non -missing observation for a subject  (i.e., excluding data 
obtained after res cue) will be carried forward  for analysis . 
• Data collected after the start of rescue medication will NOT be considered missing , and 
the primary efficacy endpoint analyses will be performed based on all observed data.  
 
For all other endpoints , the missing data will not be imputed and only the observed data will 
be used in the analyse s. 
The number, timing, pattern, reason for and possible implications of missing values in 
efficacy and safety assessments will be investigated.  The  dropout patterns  may be assessed 
by [CONTACT_26292] .

 9.1.2  Multiple Comparisons / Multiplicity  
The primary objective of this study is to identify the effect of  bexagliflozin  tablets in three 
strengths on the placebo -corrected change in HbA1c from baseline  after [ADDRESS_1204489] with a two -sided 
significance at the 5% level and the following assumptions:  
1) The placebo -corrected population mean change from ba seline to Week [ADDRESS_1204490] dose group of 20 mg will be -0.5%.  
2) The pooled standard deviation for the change from baseline to Week 12 in HbA1c for 
the active and placebo groups will be 0.9%. 
 
Under the above assumptions, an estimated sample size of 70 evaluable subjects per 
treatment arm yields approximately 90% power to detect a treatment difference between 
bexagliflozin  and placebo . A sample size of [ADDRESS_1204491] -randomization HbA1c measurement will be included in the Full 
Analysis Set (FAS).  All analyses of the FAS will be based on each subject’s r andomized 
assigned treatment.

Confidential  Page 51 of 65 
 9.3.3  Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will include all subjects in the FAS who meet the study 
eligibility requirements and have no major protocol deviations that affect the validity of the 
efficacy measurements.  Protocol deviations that may result in subject  exclusion from the PP 
Analysis Set will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic characteristics include age, gender, race, ethnicity, and study center .  Baseline 
characteristics include baseline HbA1c values, blood pressure, body weight, body mass index 
(BMI in kg/m2), fasting plasma glucose level, and prior anti -diabetic treatment status 
(whether treatment naïve or not) .  Summary statistics by [CONTACT_863782] f or discrete variables, and means, SD, Q1, medians, Q3, minimum and 
maximum for continuous variables.  
9.5 Analysis of Efficacy  
All efficacy analyses will be performed based on the FAS.  The primary endpoint analysis 
will also be conducted using the PP Analysis  Set.  
For the primary endpoint  of HbA1c  change from baseline over 12 weeks of treatment , the 
MMRM analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) with baseline HbA1c as a covariate will 
be fitted to the available data, incorporating all visits at which HbA1c was me asured for each 
subject including  the scheduled visits at weeks 2, 6, and 12 as well as the unscheduled visits 
for measurement of HbA1c  (NationalResearchCouncil, 2010 ). Treatment, study center, and 
stratification factor for randomization ( treatment naïve versus  taking one OHA  at baseline)  
will be applied as fixed effects, as will study week and study week -by-treatment interaction. 
From this model, an estimate of the treatment differ ence at week [ADDRESS_1204493] estimates in the presence of 
missing data. As sensitivity analyses for mi ssing data, the following will be performed:  
3) Missing HbA1c data (for weeks 2, 6, or 12) will be imputed via multiple imputation 
(MI), following which the MMRM will be repeated on the complete datasets with 
results combined across complete datasets using st andard MI techniques; HbA1c 
values collected after the start of rescue medication will be considered missing.  
4) Missing HbA1c data will be imputed via LOCF, following which the MMRM will be 
repeated; HbA1c values collected after the start of rescue medicatio n will be 
considered missing.  
5) HbA1c values collected after the start of rescue medication will NOT be considered 
missing , and the MMRM analyses will be re -performed.  
 
Bexagliflozin tablets   Theracos, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1204494] for a significant baseline -by-treatment  interactio n will 
be performed  in a separate model, using a 0.100 alpha level.  If the baseline -by-treatment 
interaction is significant, then the ANCOVA assumptions are violated and an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) model will be used instead , omitting the baseline cov ariate .   
A treatment by [CONTACT_863783] (or 
ANOVA) model used for the analyses of the primary efficacy variable.  If a statistically 
significant treatment by [CONTACT_863784] a  0.1 level of 
significance, then separate analyses will be performed for each study center.   
In addition to the week 12 comparisons, the change from baseline to week 2 and week 6  will 
also be analyzed from the same MMRM ANCOVA model using 95% CIs for the between -
group mean changes.   The secondary efficacy endpoint, changes in HbA1c over time will be 
assessed descriptively using graphical methods  
To examine the dose response, tests for linear and quadratic dose -response relationships 
between the doses (0 [p lacebo], 5, 10 and 20 mg bexagliflozin ) and the change from baseline 
in HbA1c at week [ADDRESS_1204495] -baseline HbA1c values on or before week 12 will be assigned to a 
category of <  7% or ≥  7%.  Incidences of reduction of HbA1c to <  7% will be analyzed using 
a logistic regression model with effects for treatment, study center and baseline 
HbA1c.   Odds ratio and the corresponding 95% CI will also be presented.

9.6.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be mapped to preferred term and body system using the Medical 
Dictionary f or Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ). AEs that begin after the first administration 
of investigational products  or existing AEs that worsen after the first dose of  study 
medication are considered treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs).  TEAEs will be assigned to the  
run-in period or the double blind randomization period in the same manner.  The number and 
percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs will be summarized for each treatment group by 
[CONTACT_14340], then by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_863786].  Drug -related AEs will be considered those to be at least possibly related to

[ADDRESS_1204512] up to 3 weeks ; washout period will be 10 weeks for subjects on a TZD 
or 6 weeks for subjects on other OHA, which includes a clinic visit (S2) and a phone interview 
(S3); run -in period is to be 2 weeks (S4 to S5); the treatment period (V1 to V4) will be 12 weeks.  
A visit window of ± 3 days is allowed for all visits except visit V1.  Visit V1 is to be scheduled at 3 
days after visit S5 and can be extended to 5 days pending on HbA1c value availability.  
2 Counseling  will be performed at S2 for washout and at S4 for treatment naïve subjects.  
3 A complete physical examination will b e performed by [CONTACT_109481] (S1) and at 
the termination visit ( V5).  Abbreviated physical examinations will be performed by [CONTACT_863792], unless clinically indicated.  General  assessment of the skin, 
heart, lun gs and abdomen will be performed.  
[ADDRESS_1204513] at visit S2 (for subjects 
undergoing washout) or S4 (for subjects not undergoing washout), and subjects will be trained in 
glucometer use and SMBG recording. The SMBG record will be reviewed by [CONTACT_863793].  
[ADDRESS_1204514] kit  will be dispensed; subjects should bring in their study 
medication to be checked  on visits V2, V3, and V4 . 
[ADDRESS_1204515] be confirmed prior to blood draw.  
7 UPT is scheduled for all women at screening and for WOCBP the reafter.

2. LDL-C will be calculated by [CONTACT_6459]. If triglycerides are > 400 mg/dL, the 
calculated LDL -C value is invalid by [CONTACT_272260]. Direct LDL -C will 
be determined in subjects whose baseline triglycerides are > 300 mg/dL.  All subsequent LDL -C 
of these subjects will be determined by [CONTACT_272292] -C measurements only.  
3. Infectious disease testing will be conducted at screening only.  
4. Urine drug screen will be performed on screening visit only. Drug abuse screening includes 
amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine metabolites, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and cannabinoids.   
5. Urinalysis will be collected routinely at all clinic visits except S2 from a clean catch sample. 
Glucose in the urinalysis results must be suppressed from the laboratory report so the dosing 
blind can be maintained.  Testing strips with only the leucocytes  and nitrate will be provided for 
immediate assessment at the clinical sites.  
6. UACR will be determined at screening only .  
7. Urine pregnancy test (UPT) will be performed for WOCBP at all clinic visits, except Visits S2. 
For surgically sterile or post - menopau sal women, it will only be done at Visit S1.  
8. Blood samples for the population PK analysis will be drawn at or during the week of V2 , V3, or 
V4 from 240 randomly selected subjects in participating trial centers.

 Appendix 3  Estimating Glomerular Filtration Rate  
The equation for estimating  glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) from serum creatinine is  the 
isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) -traceable Modification  of Diet in Renal Disease 
(MDRD) Study equation. This eGFR  calculator applies  serum creatinine (Scr) repor ted in 
mg/dL.  
The eGFR  for non -Japanese  subjects  should be calculated based on following equation   
eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (Scr)-1.154 × (Age)-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x (1.212 if 
African American)  
The eGFR  for Japanese  subjects  should be calculated based on following equation  (Matsuo et 
al., 2009 ) : 
eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 194 × ( Scr)-1.094 × (Age)-0.287× (0.739 if female)

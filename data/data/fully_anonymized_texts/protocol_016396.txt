1.  SYSTEM OVERVIEW  
1.1  The iotaSOFT™ Insertion System is an electrode array insertion tool that assists 
cochlear implant (CI) surgeons to insert CI electrode arrays with consistent insertion speed 
and force. The system consists of a single -use, sterile drive unit connected to a reusable, non-
sterile touch screen control console and footpedal interface (Figure s 1, 2, & 3. See also 
Overview Video 1 and Attachment 1 Device Description). After standard mastoidectomy and 
facial recess approach for cochlear implantation, the surgeon secures the stage base to the 
skull at superior edge of mastoidectomy with two pre- loaded self -drilling bone screws  (Figure 
3). The drive unit is placed into the stage base and the adjustable drive head is coupled to a 
compatible CI electrode. Using manual m anipulation, the drive unit head is positioned outside 
the facial recess and aligned to the surgeon- desired electrode array insertion trajectory. Before 
insertion begins, the surgeon selects the desired speed from 0.1mm/sec to 1.0mm/sec in 0.1mm/sec interv als. With direct access and view of the surgical site, the surgeon controls the 
electrode insertion forward and reverse motion via footpedal while guiding the electrode array into the cochlea with standard CI instrumentation as necessary. Upon the completi on of 
electrode array insertion and securing the array at the cochlea, the drive head and unit are uncoupled from the electrode lead and removed from the patient for disposal . The surgical site 
is close d and CI procedure is completed in the standard fashion.

2.  BACKGROUND  
2.1   360 million people worldwide, or 5% of the global population, have disabling 
hearing loss (>40 dB). Moderate to severe hearing loss affects 6.3 million patients in the 
US, yet only 5- 6% of people who meet CI candidacy cri teria receive a CI.[ADDRESS_212378] description of “atraumatic” insertion techniques in 1993,
[ADDRESS_212379] shown that trauma to the cochlea during electrode insertion results in 
damage to delicate inner ear structures, reduced implant performance, and the potential 
loss of residual hearing.3–[ADDRESS_212380] 
shown that greater speeds directly correlate with greater intracochlear forces.9,10 Further , 
multiple studies demonstrate that high insertion forces damage the delicate structures of the 
cochlea, limiting CI performance and increasing the likelihood of the loss of residual hearing.11–
[ADDRESS_212381] also been shown to increase the prevalence of intracochlear 
pressure spi[INVESTIGATOR_180415].14–16 
 
2.4  Lastly , a clinical retrospective study evaluating CI recipi[INVESTIGATOR_180416] a “slow” manual speed ( Average: 0.25mm/sec) experienced improved hearing 
preservation, decreased vestibular symptoms, and more complete electrode insertions 
compared to the “fast” speed ( Average: 0.87 mm/sec).viii 
 
3.  INTEN DED /INDICATIONS FOR USE  
3.1   The iotaSOFT™ Cochlear Implant Electrode Insertion System is intended to aid the 
surgeon in placement of cochlear implant electrode arrays into a radiographically normal 
cochlea by [CONTACT_180423].  
 
4.  BENEFIT  
4.1 The benefit of the iotaSOFTTM Insertion System is to provide the surgeon a 
standardized, more controlled,  and consistent method of inserting the electrode array 
compared to manual insertion techniques. The system enables the surgeon to perform CI  
electrode array insert ions more consistently and slowly than the capabilities of human motion. 
Literature shows consistent and slow insertions decrease the risk of additional hearing loss or 
vestibular symptoms from inherently uncontrolled, variable, and excessively forceful ma nual 
insertions.12 The iotaSOFTTM Insertion System also provides consistency of electrode array 
insertions among different ENT surgeons, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_180417]

equally slow and consistent insertion regardless of the surgeon performing the procedure or 
the electrode array used.  
4.2. Known risks associated with manual cochlear implantation (the current gold standard)  
includ e electrode translocation, electrode tip fold- over, incorrect placement of electrode array, 
loss of residual hearing, and/ or vestibular  symptoms.  Currently, experienced CI surgeons  
mitigate these risks by  [CONTACT_180424]. 
The iotaSOFTTM insertion system enhances the surgeon’s ability beyond the capability  of 
human motion during the electrode  insertion and therefore has the potential to reduce the 
current risk profile inherent in the standard CI surgical procedure.  
4.3. Similarly, by [CONTACT_180425] y during CI surgery , the system has the potential to expand patient 
access for those with severe hearing loss in which less than 5% of eligible patients receive a 
CI.  
5.[ADDRESS_212382] probabilities (<10-5) and have been mitigated by [CONTACT_180426]. A list of all potential patient risks, their severity, and 
the mitigation steps taken is outlined in Table 1.

 5.2.  In addition to the testing listed as device -specific mitigations above, the device was 
evaluated against the current techniques to ensure no new risks (not listed above) were added by [CONTACT_180427]. The current known risks associated with 
manual cochlear implantation, including electrode translocation, electrode tip fold- over, 
incorrect placement of electrode array, loss of residual hearing, or vestibular symptoms, are 
currently attempted to be reduced by [CONTACT_180428]. The iotaSOFTTM insertion system enhances the 
surgeon’s ability beyond the limits of human motion capabilities during CI insertions and 
therefore has the potential to reduce the current risk profile inherent in the standard CI surgical 
procedure. In summary, the risks associated with the iotaSOFTTM Insertion System have been 
successfully mitigated and are no worse than manual insertion. This  conclusion was also 
supported by [CONTACT_180429] C omparative Analysis (see 6.1.3 Summary below 
and Attachment 4  for full report).  
6 RISK MITIGATION –  SUPPORTING DATA SUMMARY  
6.1.  As part of the overall risk mitigation, the iotaSOFTTM Insertion System was tested for 
functionality  and safety in four categorical testing protocols and reports .  Results are included 
in Attachments 2-5 and summarized briefly here.  
6.1.1.  Bench Performance Testing Report  (Attachment 2 – Doc #720 -036-0031)  
This report verified  the functionality of the system  according to design inputs  following 
simulated transportation  and distribution and accelerated aging. The specific device 
requirements that were tested include:  
[IP_ADDRESS]. The device performs to the desired speed (selected between 0.1mm/s and 
1.0mm/s) within 20%.

[IP_ADDRESS]. The device can overcome electrode slip forces of at least 80mN.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. The device has maximum insertion forces and insertion force variation 
significa ntly less than the literature derived manual insertion forces and force 
variation, <300mN and ≤400mN/sec respectively.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Forces imparted by [CONTACT_180430] <100mN to ensure the device does not cause the electrode 
to dislodge during device removal.  
[IP_ADDRESS] .  Forces imparted by [CONTACT_180431][INVESTIGATOR_4790] a surgeon could impart on the electrode using a 
pad pi[INVESTIGATOR_180418].  
6.1.2.  Benc htop Comparative Analysis Report  (Attachment 3 – Doc #722 -036-0021)  
This engineering study compared  the insertional force profiles obtained when inserting 
cochlear implant electrodes into synthetic cochleae using either  manual  technique or  the 
iotaSOFTTM insertion system.   Results showed that:  
[IP_ADDRESS] .  The average insertion force variation for iotaSOFTTM driven electrode arrays  
was 78% lower than the average insertion force for manually inserted electrodes at 0.1mm/sec and 70% lower at 1.0mm.sec. These comparisons 
were both significantly different (p≤0.007).  
[IP_ADDRESS] .  The average of maximum insertion f orce for iotaSOFT
TM driven electrode 
arrays  was significantly lower than average of maximum insertion force for 
manually driven electrodes (p<0.05); for both insertion rates, a 51% and 32% 
reduction at 0.1mm/sec and 1.0mm/sec, respectively, was observed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  The iotaSOFTTM insertion system performed electrode array insertions with a 
lower variance of insertion force and force variation compared to manual 
surgeon insertions across surgeon skill levels. The total variance (cluster + 
residual) for the i nsertion force variation using the iotaSOFTTM assisted 
insertion was 186% and 190% lower than manual insertions for 0.1 and 1mm/sec respectively. Similarly, the maximum insertion force total variance for 
iotaSOFT
TM assisted insertion was 190% and 188% lower compared to manual 
insertions across varying surgeon experience levels at both 0.1 and 1 mm/sec 
insertion rates, respectively.  
 
6.1.3.  Cadaveric Comparative Analysis Report  (Attachment 4 – Doc #722 -036-0020)  
This report evaluated  the effect of the iotaSOFT insertion system on the final intracochlear 
electrode array position and electrode functionality compared to manual insertion of cochlear 
implant electrode arrays in cadaveric cochleae during simulated operati ve use.  Results 
showed that:  
[IP_ADDRESS] .  When compared directly to manual insertions, the iotaSOFT™ insertion system 
electrode insertions exhibited a lower percentage of intracochlear scala 
translocations, though the result was not statistically significant.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  A lower percentage of tip fold- overs was also observed with the iotaSOFT™ 
insertion system electrode insertions when compared to manual electrode 
insertions, though this result was also not statistically significant.

[IP_ADDRESS]  A lower percentage of tip fold -overs was also observed with the iotaSOFT™ 
insertion system electrode insertions when compared to manual electrode 
insertions, though this result was also not statistically significant.  
 6.1.4.  Usability Validation Report (Attachment 5 – Doc #712- 036-0010)  
The Usability Study assess ed the occurrence of use errors related to the device.  16 ENT 
Surgeon/Nurse teams ( in which the surgeons had completed a training session and training 
decay time ) perf ormed an CI implantation into a cadaveric cephalus in a simulated use 
environment. Test engineers observed insertions and noted any use errors, and user 
comments including a questionnaire and scoring table were collected. Results showed that:  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Har ms associated with the use errors found in the study were minor: prolonged 
operative/anesthesia time due to delay during surgery and prolonged 
operative/anesthesia time due to delay during set up. These minor potential  
harms were associated with use errors witnessed in a small percentage of users and tasks and were mitigated with a design change (eliminating the 
difficulties experienced with the device screwdriver) and updates to items 
emphasized in training. The residual use -related risk was minor and could not 
be further reduced wi th additional mitigations.  
[IP_ADDRESS].   For all tasks, the use errors found could not lead to serious patient harm and no 
risk mitigations would lead to the reduction of overall or individual risks. The Usability results support that the iotaSOFT
TM Insertion System is safe and 
effective for use by [CONTACT_180432] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Surgeons can 
successfully use the iotaSOFTTM Insertion system to aid in placement of the 
electrode into the cochlea with nurse staff support.  
 
7. CONCLUSION  
The benefits of the device outweigh the minimal risks  associated with the device. The 
iotaSOFTTM Insertion System provides the benefit of a 70% reduction in insertion force, 30% 
reduction in force variation (jerk), 180% reduction in variation between insertions with different 
surgeons or with different elect rodes, and reduction in occurrence of electrode scala 
translocations and tip fold- over when compared to manual insertion. Furthermore, the 
iotaSOFTTM Insertion System is not statistically  different than standard manual insertion 
techniques related to inser tion angle, intracochlear scala position,  and electrode electrical 
functionality. The risks associated with the device are not a significant clinical risk  and are 
further mitigated by [CONTACT_180433].

10.4  Device Surgical Use   
CI surgery will be conducted as per each surgeon’s standard clinical practic e and surgical 
approach incl uding cortical mastoidectomy and facial recess approach to the cochlea for 
cochlear implantation.  The surgeon then secures the stage base to the skull at superior edge of mastoidectomy with two pre- loaded self -drilling cortical bone screws  and supplied sterile 
screwdriver . The drive unit is placed into the stage base and the adjustable drive head is 
coupled to a compatible CI silicon lead by [CONTACT_180439][INVESTIGATOR_180420] C I excess silicone lead 
away from the electrode array . With manual  surgeon manipulation, the drive unit head is 
positioned outside the facial recess and aligned to the surgeon- desired electrode array 
insertion trajectory. Before insertion begins, the surgeo n selects the desired speed from 
0.1mm/sec to 1.0mm/sec in 0.1mm/sec intervals  using footpedal control ler. With direct access 
and microscopic view of the surgical site, the surgeon advances or retracts the electrode array 
via footpedal  while guiding the electrode array into the cochlea with standard manual CI 
instrumentation as necessary. Upon the completion of electrode array insertion and securing the array at the cochlea, the surgeon unclips the drive head and unit from the excess si licone 
lead then removes the device and screws  from the patient for disposal . Per current standard of 
care, c ochlea view X -rays will be performed,  and t he surgical site is then close d. For detailed

11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.1 Definitions  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject. This may include illness, sign(s), symptom(s), or clinically significant laboratory test abnormality that has 
appeared or worsened during the course of the study, regardless of ca usal relationship to the 
study device(s) under study.  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is 
life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant or patient was at risk of death at 
the time of  the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe), requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient/participant or may 
require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed 
in the definition above. Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition without 
subsequent serious deterioration in health is not considered a serious adverse event.  
An Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is any untoward or unintended response to a medical device.

(This includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for 
use or the procedures related to the device.) This includes any AE that is determined to be 
definitely or probably a result of device use.  
An Anticipated Adverse Device Effect (AADE) is an adverse device -related event that has 
been identified as to the nature, severity or  incidence in the protocol.  
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previous ly identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates 
to the rights, safety, or  welfare of subjects.  
11.[ADDRESS_212401] his/her decision on the AE form. The relationship to the study product or 
procedure will  be determined by [CONTACT_737], as being: a) definitely related, b) probably 
related, c) possibly related, d) unlikely related or e) not related.  
If an event is deemed serious, such events will be reported to the Sponsor via the completion 
of the Seri ous Adverse Event CRF.  
11.3 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
Adverse events classified as "serious" or “unanticipated” (SAEs or UADEs) will be reported 
promptly to the IRB and study Sponsor to comply with regulatory requirements.  All serious 
AEs, w hether related or unrelated to the device, as well as all UADEs, will be immediately 
reported (but in no event later than [ADDRESS_212402] learns of the event) to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_180440].  
The Sponsor will immediately conduct an evaluation of any unanticipated adverse device effect. If the Sponsor determines that an unanticipated adverse device effect presents an 
unreasonable risk to subjects, the Sponsor will terminate all investigati ons or parts of

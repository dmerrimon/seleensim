Background: 
L
ymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_386479] a standard procedure for the 
surgical staging of patients with early stage breast cancer. It has been shown to be safe and accu-
rate and limits significantly the need for traditional axillary dissection in many patients with ear-
ly stage breast cancer. Traditionally, lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_386480] 99mTc-labeled 
radiotracer, or visible blue dye (methylene blue or isosulfan blue dye), or a combination of 
99mTc-labeled radiotracer and visible blue dye. Sentinel nodes are defined as axillary lymph 
nodes in which there is the accumulation of one or more of these tracers or dyes. 
The use of 99mTc-labeled radiotracer has a long history and is one of the more commonly used 
techniques of identifying sentinel nodes. However, the use of radiotracers has significant limita-
tions including the requirement for nuclear licensing; the need to prepare, handle and dispose of 
nuclear material, patient inconvenience with painful injections typi[INVESTIGATOR_386481]-
gery.  
There is a growing body of literature supporting the role of indocyanine green (ICG) dye for 
lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_386482].  ICG is a fluorescent dye which can be detected using 
near infrared cameras.  The use of ICG in conjunction with a near infrared camera offers many 
potential advantages over the use of other techniques including the ability to inject the material 
while the patient is under anesthesia in the operating room, the ability to use near infrared imag-
ing to directly visualize lymphatic flow, and no special material handling is required.  ICG is 
FDA approved for vascular fluorescence and liver function studies in humans.   
ICG is a di-sulfonated heptamethine indocyanine with moderate optical properties, which emits 
≈ 8 00 nm. There are many uses for ICG during image-guided surgery. After intravenous injec-
tion, it can be used for NIR angiography of blood vessels, identification of the extrahepatic bile 
ducts, and identification of liver metastases. After subcutaneous injection, ICG has been reported 
by [CONTACT_386492] (SLN) mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007](1-5) and as-
sessing lymphatic function.”(6)  
ICG has been used for the last 50+ years as a visible dye (green for ICG). Thus, there is an un-
precedented body of clinical data regarding their safety when used at millimolar concentrations.”  
(6) The use of ICG for lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_386483] (7-11). There is a recent retro-
spective case series report of using ICG for lymph node mappi[INVESTIGATOR_386484] (12).  
A recent study from Europe has demonstrated high concordance between the number nodes 
identified with ICG and 99mTc-labeled radiotracer (11).  There has been very limited work on 
the use of ICG for axillary lymph node mappi[INVESTIGATOR_386485], and no com-
parison studies of ICG with 99mTc-labeled radiotracer. The goal of the project is to confirm 
that axillary lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_386486] a similar number of nodes being labeled 
as sentinel as lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_18499] 99mTc-labeled radiotracer. Successful completion of 
this project would support the use of 99mTc-labeled radiotracer with ICG for LN mappi[INVESTIGATOR_386487].

Hypothesis:  
I
CG is equivalent to 99mTc-labeled radiotracer for axillary lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_386488].  
 
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
Methods: 
Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of clinical stage [ADDRESS_484314] cancer surgery with lumpectomy or mastectomy and planned axillary sentinel node 
biopsy procedure will be eligible for the study.  Patients with cancer > 3cm, clinically posi-
tive nodes, prior surgery for breast cancer in the index breast, bilateral sentinel lymph node 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], thyroid dysfunction, hypersensitivity to iodine, and hepatic or renal insufficiency 
will be excluded from the study.  
• We plan to enroll approximately [ADDRESS_484315] clinic at Cleveland Clinic Main Campus.   
• Informed consent will be obtained. 
• Patient information will be collected from the medical record and entered in Redcap. 
Patients will undergo lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_18499]  99mTc sulfur colloid in accordance with routine 
clinical practice.  Injections of 99mTc sulfur colloid will take place the afternoon prior to planned 
next morning surgery or on the morning of surgery.  Patients will undergo lymphoscintigraphy in 
accordance with standard clinical practice.    
Immediately prior to operation, after the induction of anesthesia in the operating room, up to 1cc 
of 0.5% ICG solution will be injected subdermally or intradermally close to, above the tu-
mor,into the subareolar region or into the periareolar region after disinfection of the breast skin.  
ICG movement will be facilitated by [CONTACT_386493]. 
ICG fluorescence will be elicited and detected by [CONTACT_386494] (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hama-
matsu, Japan) which has FDA 510(k) clearance to visualize ICG fluorescence in the humans for 
vascular imaging.  The lymphatic drainage, made evident by [CONTACT_386495], will be moni-
tored in real time on a monitor. The fluorescence will be followed towards the axilla and time for 
the fluorescence to reach the axilla will be recorded. In accordance with standard practice, an 
incision will be made in the axilla. Fluorescent lymph nodes (ICG positive) will be localized and 
removed and sent for pathologic analysis as per standard surgical practice. Node removal will 
continue until no residual fluorescence is visible in the axilla.  Excised nodes will be tested for 
radioactivity using a standard gamma-detecting probe and the counts per minute will be record-
ed. Finally, the axillary region will be inspected with the gamma probe to determine if there are 
any residual radioactive nodes. Residual sentinel nodes will be removed. With regard to radioac-
tivity, sentinel nodes are defined as any node with at least 10% of the hottest nodal counts.   
The following information will be collected for each removed node:

2. Counts per minute   
3. Pathologic status  of node (no metastasis, isolated tumor cells, micrometastasis, macro-
metastasis) 
Also collected will be procedure related data including transit time to axilla from time of injec-
tion, size of tumor, location of tumor, tumor histology, breast size, patient age, BMI.

view Board (IRB) for formal approval to conduct the study.  The decision of the IRB concerning 
the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator.  
  
7.0        STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Sample size: 
The study will be designed to determine whether ICG based axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy 
yields a similar number of nodes as 99mTc sulfur colloid lymph node biopsy.  While SLN identi-
fication using  99mTc sulfur colloid is a common technique, neither of the two methods used in 
this study can be assumed to identify the “correct”  set of nodes as sentinel. Therefore, for the 
purposes of this study, the sentinel status of a node will be defined as being flagged as sentinel 
by [CONTACT_386497] 99mTc methods.  By [CONTACT_13748], sentinel nodes identified 
by 99mTc but not ICG are an error by [CONTACT_386498] 99mTc are an error by [CONTACT_941] 99mTc method. 
Let A be the number of Tc-positive and ICG-positive SNs detected, B be the number of Tc-
positive and ICG-negative SNs detected, and C  be the number of Tc-negative and ICG-positive 
SNs detected. The total number ( N) of SNs detected is therefore N  = (A + B + C ); the proportion 
of SNs (P Tc) detected by [CONTACT_386499] ( A + B )/N; and the proportion of SNs (P ICG) detected 
by [CONTACT_386500] ( A + C )/N. 
As significant differences in the numbers of nodes identified by [CONTACT_386501]-
cations regarding  the safety of ICG as a radiotracer, t he null hypothesis is that the two methods 
identify an equivalent nodes of nodes as being sentinel nodes.  Here equivalence is defined as the 
difference in the proportions of nodes flagged between the 99mTc and ICG methods  falling within 
an interval (−δ, +δ),  where δ  is taken to be 5%. Formally the null hypothesis for  equivalence is:  
PI[INVESTIGATOR_294535] − P Tc < −δ and P ICG − P Tc ≥ +δ 
If the null hypothesis is rejected we may concluded for the hypothesis of equivalence that:  
δ < (P ICG − P Tc) < δ 
The equivalence hypothesis can be transformed into two one-sided hypotheses:  
(A) 
that the difference between the proportions is beyond the lower equivalence margin: null 
hypothesis A: P ICG − P Tc < −δ, which, if rejected, permits the conclusion P ICG − P Tc ≥ −δ 
(B) 
that the difference between the proportions is greater than the upper equivalence margin: 
null hypothesis B: P ICG − P Tc ≥ +δ which, if rejected, permits the conclusion 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_294535] − P Tc ≤ +δ. 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] Protocol v5 11-18-16                                                                                           Page 7 of 8  Hypotheses A and B will be tested by [CONTACT_23992] a two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for 
the difference in the proportions of SNs flagged by [CONTACT_386502], with the 5% equivalence 
region (−δ, +δ). Tests for equivalence will be based on the method s for analyzing clustered 
paired binary data described in Obuchowski(13). To conclude for equivalence the 90% CI needs 
to be contained entirely within the defined equivalence region, which is equivalent to both null 
hypotheses (A) and (B) being rejected. 
To estimate the number of SNs that will need to be examined, we assumed a detection rate ( A + 
B)/N of 97% for the Tc method, a discordance rate between the two methods ( B + C )/N of 6%, 
and set δ at 5%. We found through simulation that 2 55 SNs  will give adequate power (>80%) to 
demonstrate equivalence between the two methods, with a type I error ( α) rate of 5%.  This is 
estimated to require ~130 patients as the average SN yield is expected to be approximately 2 per 
patient.

Protocol Title:  Rapid local anesthesia by [CONTACT_882115] 4 of 14   Version: 4.[ADDRESS_1233638] Design  Feasibility : First -in-humans clinical trial  
Primary Objective  To determine if the combination of STAR particles with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_882094] a commonly used FDA -approved topi[INVESTIGATOR_558825] (LET gel)  in children.  
Secondary Objective(s)  1. To evaluate 10% STAR -particle concentration  and  
500 m length for lidocaine delivery into skin and 
associated local anesthesia in children . 
2. To evaluate the TEWL on the skin before and after 
application of STAR particles  
Research 
Intervention(s)/Interactions  STAR particles  
STAR particles are millimeter -scale particles with micron -
scale projections made of biocompatible materials that 
painlessly disrupt the stratum corneum . As STAR particles 
are rubbed on skin, their microscopic projections create 
micron -scale pores in the stratum corneum to increase skin 
permeability to topi[INVESTIGATOR_882095].  After the arms of the STAR 
particle puncture the skin, the elastic forces of the skin 
push the particles out.

age)  
Sample Size  25 
Study Duration for 
individual participants  One visit with each visit lasting 2 -4 hours and follow -up by

2. Objectives  
A. Primary  
1. To determine if the application of STAR particles  (10%  concentration and 500 m 
length ) applied prior to  a topi[INVESTIGATOR_882097]  (LET gel)  will expedite lidocaine 
delivery into skin and associated local anesthesia in comparison to  a commonly used 
FDA-approved application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242] (LET gel)  in children.  
 
3. Background  
Administration of more than 20 billion injections each year around the world, and placement 
of over 200 million intravenous catheters occurs annually in the [LOCATION_002]. Pain caused 
by [CONTACT_882117]. This fear often starts with 
children, of whom over 60% report a moderate to severe fear of needles. Other than their 
disease, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_882098]. There is 
evidence that many children acquire a fear of needles, which often continues and amplifies 
with age leading, for example, to refused blood sampling and vaccine administration in up to 
40% of adults – all due to fear of needles.  
 
Local anesthesia alleviates pain and fear associated with injections. The ideal local anesthetic 
for the clinical setting should be effective; have rapid onset; be fast and easy to load and 
administer with minimal user training; be portable; cause minimal pain; and be cost effective.  
Several methods of inducing local anesthesia exist, but each of them comes with limitations. 
Injectable lidocaine further increases fear and anxiety, and is painful. In contrast, topi[INVESTIGATOR_882099] a painless and simp le means of administering local anesthesia, but they 
unfortunately rely upon slow diffusion into the skin, leading to onset times of 20 to 60 
minutes. This delayed onset is the main barrier for widespread clinical use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_882100].  
 
Lidocaine delivery into skin is blocked by [CONTACT_394250]’s stratum corneum barrier. To address this 
limitation, collaborators at Georgia Tech developed STAR particles, which are millimeter -scale 
particles with micron -scale projections made of biocompatible mate rials that painlessly 
disrupt the stratum corneum. These particles are made of titanium dioxide, a widely -used 
and safe ceramic material found in sunscreens, cosmetics, and paint.  The STAR particles have 
no more risk for causing an adverse or serious adver se event than those of regularly used 
over -the-counter skin products.  STAR particles are designed to incorporate invisibly into 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_882101].  The 
composition of the gel that will be used to formulate the STAR particles will be aloe gel. We 
are not aware of any risks posed by [CONTACT_882118], with the exception of the extreme rare cause of 
allergic or anaphylactic reaction. This aloe gel does not pose a ny obvious risks and is 
Protocol Title:  Rapid local anesthesia by [CONTACT_882115] 6 of 14   Version: 4.[ADDRESS_1233639] to see, but large 
enough to enable delivery of molecules like lidocaine into skin. A STAR particle micro -
projection length of a few hundred microns with a tapered ge ometry provides mechanical 
strength with a sharp tip (<10  µm radius) to facilitate insertion into skin without pain. The 
star-shaped geometry is designed to inhibit complete insertion of the particle into skin so 
STAR particles do not remain embedded in the skin. After the arms of the STAR particle 
puncture the sk in, the elastic forces of the skin push the particles out.  From our previous 
publication, the only adverse effect from the use of STAR particles was local erythema (Tadros 
AR et al. STAR particles for enhanced topi[INVESTIGATOR_882102]. Nature Medicine. 
2020, 26: 341 –347.).  
The use of LET gel (Edge pharma, London) is indicated for topi[INVESTIGATOR_882103]. We know from our previous study and publication that the STAR 
particles make miniscule punctures in the skin allowing a drug applied after can only enter 
the skin through these tiny pores that quickly seal. Using the STAR parti cles will be less 
invasive than any open  wound a child could present with who would normally be receiving 
LET gel prior to suture closure or instrumentation of the wound. There would be no way that 
when LET gel delivered at the appropriate dose could ever enter the skin and overdose a 
patient than delivering it through any open wound that the LET gel is already approved for.  
We realize that it is not uncommon for the FDA to test drugs or devices in adults (to assess 
safety and efficacy) prior to children, however, there would be no endpoint to determine if 
the STAR particles with LET gel is efficacious in adults, as few adults  will be as interested or 
concerned with pain or local anesthesia.  
4. Study Endpoints  
A. Primary  
1) Determine the T SP of the STAR particle (10% concentration and 500 m length) in 
children and compare to the TLET and determine which application results in a more 
rapid time for local anesthesia.   
B. Second ary 
1) Determine the TEWL (trans epi[INVESTIGATOR_7044]) measurement before and after 
application of the STAR particle s and compare to the TEWL measurement before and 
after application of the aloe gel.   
 
5. Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
This is a single -center study to compare  the time to local anesthesia  following application of  STAR 
particles applied prior to skin application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] l idocaine  (LET gel)  to application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_558825] (LET gel) alone  at one location in 25 healthy children , adolescents  and young adults .  
Protocol Title:  Rapid local anesthesia by [CONTACT_882115] 7 of 14   Version: 4.0 27APR2023  
IRB Form BIO 03152021  The investigational agent will be STAR particles made of titanium dioxide, a widely -used and safe 
ceramic material found in sunscreens, cosmetics, and paint.  The particles will vary in 
concentration and length in order to find the optimal concentration and length. The star -shaped 
geometry is designed to inhibit complete insertion of the particle into skin so STAR particles do 
not remain embedded in the skin. After the arms of the STAR particle puncture the skin, the 
elastic forces of the skin push the parti cles out.   
6. Procedures Involved  
After signing the informed consent form, eligible participants will be enrolled in the study . At the 
visit, the TEWL will be measured using a wireless, portable Vapometer  (Delfin Technologies, 
Finland) on the volar surface of the forearm where the the STAR particles will be applied. T he 
STAR particle  (in aloe gel)  will be delivered to the skin immediately prior to the LET gel so that 
the time to achieve anesthesia for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242]  (LET gel)  after STAR particle application 
(TSP) can be compared to the time to achieve anesthesia for application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242] (LET 
gel) alone  (TLET). The STAR particle will always be applied to the participant’s right arm but  the 
order of applying STAR particle will be randomized by a computer -generated random sequence.  
After application of the STAR particles, and prior to applying the LET gel, TEWL will again be 
measured using the  wireless, portable Vapometer (Delfin Technologies, Finland).  
 
The same procedure of measuring the TEWL will be followed on the forearm not receiving the 
STAR particle application (Aloe gel).   
 
A. LET Gel after STAR Particle Application (Right Arm):  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242]  (0.5 grams  of Lidocaine in LET gel ) will be applied immediately after applying 
a STAR particle  preparation to the volar surface of the mid -forearm at two  locations  (right 
antecubidal fossa and right wrist) . Immediately after application  of the STAR particles, the 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242]  (LET gel)  will be applied. Immediately after the topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242]  (LET gel)  is 
applied,  pain will be assessed  by [CONTACT_882119] -Prick Pain test. 
The time that the subject reports no pain (complete local anesthe sia) will be recorded as the 
time to achieve anesthesia for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_882104]  (TSP) at 
both  sites.  
 
B. LET GEL  Application  without STAR Particle Application  (Left Arm):  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242]  (0.5 grams  of Lidocaine in LET gel ) will be applied immediately after applying 
aloe gel (CONTROL) to the volar surface of the mid -forearm at two  locations  (right antecubidal 
fossa and right wrist) . Immediately after application  of the aloe gel , the topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242] (LET 
gel) will be applied. Immediately after the topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242] (LET gel) is applied,  pain will be 
assessed  by [CONTACT_882119] -Prick Pain test. The time that the 
subject reports no pain (complete local anesthesia) will be re corded as the time to achieve 
anesthesia for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_882105]  (TLET) at both  sites.  
 
The physician  will also evaluate local tolerability by [CONTACT_882120][INVESTIGATOR_24242] (LET gel)  alone  
and topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242]  (LET gel)  post -STAR particle  application site for acute skin reactions (ASRs), 
AEs, and SAEs on the day of application , 1 hour [±5 minutes] after the application, 24-hours after 
Protocol Title:  Rapid local anesthesia by [CONTACT_882115] 8 of 14   Version: 4.0 27APR2023  
IRB Form BIO 03152021  application, one week after application , and 30 days after application . Specifically, the  participant 
(and parent) will  report if the  participant’s  skin has  erythema, edema, blistering, tenderness, 
bleeding, bruising , or any type of skin change . ASRs will be scored quantitatively with qualitative 
remarks as needed. ASRs, AEs, and SAEs of interest will be recorded.

11. Vulnerable Populations  
The research does not contain vulnerable populations . 
12. Local Number of Participants  
25 children , adolescents and young adults  10-21-years of age . 
 
13. Recruitment Methods  
Participants will be recruited from Emory /CHOA  pediatric Endocrine outpatient clinics. 
Participants will be recruited throughout the course of the study. Participants will be approached 
in clinic by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_882107]. There 
will be no recruitment materials.  Eligibility will be reviewed through questioning the participants, 
their parents, and review of the patients medical chart . 
 
14. Withdrawal of Participants  
The participant may be withdrawn from the research without their consent if  they are not able 
to follow the protocol.   
 
Given the minimal risk associated with STAR particles  and previous history of STAR particles  used 
in humans, there does not appear to be any obvious anticipated circumstances under which 
participants will be withdrawn from the research without their consent.  
 
If participants withdraw from the research, data collected will be retained and utilized as an 
intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis.  
Protocol Title:  Rapid local anesthesia by [CONTACT_882115] 10 of 14   Version: 4.[ADDRESS_1233641] more rapid entry and then, due to the elastic forces of the 
skin, will push the particles out. From the time the STAR particles are  applied to the skin , the 
possible risks would be expected to be  local skin reactions at the site of STAR particle application  
including   erythema, edema, tenderness, bleeding, and/or bruising.  
 
A systemic reaction would be unlikely to occur, but due to the potential that the application and 
retention of STAR particles  in the skin could facilitate bacterial entry into the skin, in addition to 
the local reactions listed above, systemic reactions including: fever, cough, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, fatigue, and headaches could also occur. Based on previous human research with STAR 
particles , local and systemic  reactions are unlikely to occur ( 1). Acute skin reactions ( ASRs ) will 
be scored quantitativ ely with qualitative remarks as needed.  The application of the STAR particles 
is expected to have a minimal risk to the subject. It is possible subjects could describe the 
placement of the STAR particles  as uncomfortable or painful, but based on previous human 
studies ( 1) this seems less likely. We will take precautions to prevent infections, such as using 
sterilized or low bioburden materials  and wipi[INVESTIGATOR_882108].  
 
We hypothesize that the STAR particles will not  remain in the skin. Our previous research on STAR 
particles  suggests that the risk for application of STAR particles  to be minimal  (1).  The only AE 
discovered in studying patients receiving a STAR particle application has been transient local 
erythema and otherwise, has been very well tolerated in healthy human participants. The article 
published in Nature Medicine can be referenced (Tadro s AR et al. STAR particles for enhanced 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_882102]. Nature Medicine. 2020, 26: 341 –347.) The composition of the 
gel that will be used to formulate the STAR particles will be aloe gel . We are not aware of any 
risks posed by [CONTACT_882118], with the exception of the extreme rare cause of allergic or anaphylactic 
reaction. This aloe gel does not pose any obvious risks and is contained in numerous products 
such as skin lotions and hair products .These particles are made of titanium dioxide, a widely -used 
and safe ceramic material found in sunscreens, cosmetics, and paint. STAR particles are designed 
to incorporate invisibly into topi[INVESTIGATOR_882109].  
The local anesthetic we are evaluating (LET gel) is approved in children for open wounds. We 
know from our previous study and publication that the STAR particles make miniscule punctures 
in the skin allowing a drug applied after can only enter the skin thr ough these tiny pores that 
quickly seal. Using the STAR particles will be less invasive than any open  wound a child could 
present with who would normally be receiving LET gel prior to suture closure or instrumentation 
of the wound. There would be no way th at when LET gel delivered at the appropriate dose could 
ever enter the skin and overdose a patient than delivering it through any open wound that the 
LET gel is already approved for.  
Protocol Title:  Rapid local anesthesia by [CONTACT_882115] 11 of 14   Version: 4.[ADDRESS_1233642] been no reports of adverse reactions or events 
associated with LET gel, howev er, an allergic reaction or even anaphylaxis, are always potential 
possibilities.  
Based on previous clinical studies and FDA approvals of other drugs/devices using these 
materials ,  we therefore expect non -significant risk.  
 
16. Potential Benefits to Participants  
There is no direct benefit to the participant , however, there are potential future benefits to 
society from the understanding gained by [CONTACT_1758].  
17. Compensation to Participants  
Study  participants  will receive  $[ADDRESS_1233643] 
access to the data.  Staff listed on the delegation of authority log will be responsible for 
receipt and transmission of data. The coordinator or PI/Sub -I will be responsible for 
transporting the data locally.  
 
If a participant declines to participate  or is ineligible to participate for any  or all portions 
of the study, the participant will not be assigned a study ID number and the study staff 
will refrain from collecting any data on the participant.  
 
19. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants  
As this study is one with minimal risk, a DSMB will not be needed.  
Subject safety:  
• Specific subject safety parameters : subjects will report any safety -related issues or 
concerns to the PI (phone/email when not at a visit)  or in person to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_882110].  
• Subjects will report observations when at the clinic for the initial visit, and will record 
observations to be made available to the research team when either contact[CONTACT_882121] . 
• The PI s will be  responsible for safety monitoring  
Protocol Title:  Rapid local anesthesia by [CONTACT_882115] 12 of 14   Version: 4.0 27APR2023  
IRB Form BIO 03152021  • If the subject has skin irritation, pain, itching, or infection, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_882111].  
• The minimal r isk associated with STAR particles  makes it unlikely that a subject would 
develop any significant local or systemic consequence and therefore, other than subject 
choice or PI [CONTACT_75121], there is not expected to be any  condition that should stop the study.  
• Deviations, AEs, and SAEs will be reported to the IRB by [CONTACT_978].  
 
Data Integrity:  
• Specific data elements to be reviewed  include: pain (if any) associated with STAR particle 
formulation  insertion, local skin findings at initial placement, and local skin findings during 
the study.  
• Monitoring of data will occur every month after every 5 subjects are enrolled so that data 
will be monitored 4-5 times during the study depending on how quickly enrollment is 
complete.  
• The PI s will be  responsible for data monitoring  
 
Additional considerations for FDA regulated trials  
• All study activities except production of the  STAR particles  will be done on -site 
• The study team will self -monitor the study  
• The study team will use Emory University’s self -monitoring tool found on the CTAC 
website  
• The first subject enrolled will trigger a self -monitoring  event  
• No Identification of deviations or failures that would be critical to study integrity  
 
20. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interest of Participants  
Whenever possible, a study number, rather than the participants name [CONTACT_882124]. The participants name [CONTACT_882125]. All study documents will be kept in a  locked office or secure 
server.  
The sponsor representatives and regulatory authorities (e.g., IRB, OHRP) may inspect all 
documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093]. The study team will permit 
access to such records.  
Subjects  will be made aware that all research activities are completely voluntary and will not 
impact the care they receive. They will also be informed that they are allowed to withdraw from 
the study at any time.  
The quantitative data from this study will be uploaded to the DDL or another repository within 
30 days of the primary manuscript publication.  A description of the data repository will be 
included in the informed consent.

IRB Form BIO 03152021  21. Economic Burden to Participants  
There will be no costs for the participant associated with the research study.   
22. Informed Consent  
• Participants will be consented by [CONTACT_141122][INVESTIGATOR_2993]cipal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a private space in the 
CHOA Endocrine clinic or the ECC . 
• There is no standard waiting period before the participant is approached for consent 
after being told about the study.  
• The participant will be reminded throughout the study visit that participation is 
completely voluntary and that they are allowed to withdraw at any point during the 
visit or after the visit.  
• The study will be explained thoroughly to the participant and the participant will be 
allowed to ask questions. The study team will give ample time to the potential 
participants to ask questions and decide whether they would like to participate. The 
partic ipants will be reminded that the study is completely voluntary and that not 
participating will not affect their care for their medical condition. The staff 
performing the informed consent process will also ask the participant questions to 
verify understand ing of the information relayed.  
  
Non-English -Speaking Participants:   
We will not enroll any non -english  speaking participants since we are not able to get certified 
translations of the study questionnaire.  
This study will need a partial HIPAA waiver for recruitment purposes  ONLY (i.e. identifying 
potentially eligible subjects). As subjects are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], HIPAA authorization will be 
obtained.  
23. Setting  
The research will be conducted at the Emory Childrens Center (ECC)  on the Emory University 
campus. All procedures  will be performed by [CONTACT_882122]. Subjects will be in contact (email/phone) with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_882112], if it occurs when not at the ECC for a visit.  
 
All research procedures will be performed at the Emory Childrens Center  on the Emory University 
campus.  
24. Resources Available  
We are performing this study as a feasibility study and believe we have enough resources 
(Emory/CHOA outpatient Endocrine clinic ) to recruit the number of subjects we seek to study.  
 
Eric I. Felner, MD, MS  will devote 1 5% time to this study.

Protocol GO28399, Version 5 2PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION 5:
RATIONA LE
Protocol GO28399 has been amended to remove the [COMPANY_002] -designated cen tral 
pathology laboratory because cuSCC is an identified risk that no longer requires further 
evaluation by [CONTACT_825093].   Changes to the protocol are 
summarized below:
Safety follow -up visits at [ADDRESS_1144043] been removed because secondary 
malignancies are no longer characterized as an important safety concern
(Section s1.3, 3.1.1, 4.4.2, 4.5.1 , 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 5.1.1 ,and [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
End of study safety follow up and dermatological evaluations have been updated to 
assessment until 28days after the last dose of study drug (Section s3.3, [IP_ADDRESS] , 
and [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Follow -up for new primary malignancies has been updated to per investigator ’s 
discretion (Section 4.4.2).
Additional changes to the protocol, along with a rati onale for each change, are 
summarized below:
Additional new safety information ,including acute kidney injury and Dupuytren’s 
contracture, has also been added per thecurrent Vemurafenib Investigator’s 
Brochure (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Study drug storage details have been referred to the study drug label 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Adverse events of special interest and the reporting language ha vebeen clarified 
(Section s5.2.3 and 5.4.2 ).
Section 5.2.4 (Selected Adverse Events) has been deleted and information from that 
section is consolidated inSection [IP_ADDRESS] (Worsening of Malignancy) .
Adverse event reporting has been clarified (Section 5.3.1).
Persistent adverse event reporting has been clarified (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
The reporting of the term “sudden death” has been updated to also require the 
presumed cause of death (Section 5.3.5. 7).
Event reporting for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26588] (Section [IP_ADDRESS] 0).
Language has been revised to account for the fact that some sites may not allow 
follow -up on partner pregnancies (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Reporting of pregnancy in a partner of a male patient has been clarified to when 
permitted by [CONTACT_3725] (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Follow up of patients after an adverse event and reporting of adverse events after 
the reporting period have been clarified (Sections 5.5 and 5.6).
Manual signature [CONTACT_825128].

antecedent vemurafenib protocol
SPONSOR: F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Objectives
Primary Objective
The primary  objective of this study is to provide continued access to vemurafenib for eligible 
patients with BRAFV600mutation positive malignanc y who were previously treated in an 
antecedent vemurafenib protocol and did not meet the protocol’s criteria for disease progression 
or are being treated beyond progression and still deriving clinical benefit, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_1697], and may  potentially benefit from continued treatment with vemurafenib.
Secondary Objective
The secondary objective is to collect and describe safety and tolerability data for patients who 
continue vemurafenib treatment in this extension (rollover) study.
Study Design
Description of Study
This is an open -label, multicenter, non -randomized study to provide continued access to 
vemurafenib for eligible patients with BRAFV600mutation positive malignancy who were 
previously enrolled and treated in an antecedent vemurafenib protocol and did not meet the 
protocol’s criteria for disease progression or are being treated beyond progression and still 
deriving clinical benefit (as assessed by [CONTACT_093]) and may therefore potentially benefit 
from continued treatm ent with vemurafenib .  The maximum number of days between the last 
dose of study drug in the antecedent protocol and first dose in this extension ( rollover) study 
will be 15 days.  Results of the study completion visit or other visit in the antecedent prot ocol 
may be used as screening/baseline for this extension (rollover) study.  Screening/baseline is 
combined into one visit if completed within time intervals, as specified in the protocol. The first 
vemurafenib treatment in the extension (rollover) study will be recorded as Cycle 1, Day 1.  
Patients will receive treatment with oral vemurafenib at 960 mg twice daily ( BID), [ADDRESS_1144056] dose in the antecedent protocol.  Treatment will continue 
until progression of disease or as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit, as judged by [CONTACT_1275] (case- by-case decision with appr oval of the Medical Monitor), death, withdrawal of 
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version [ADDRESS_1144057].
One cycle is defined as 28 days.  Clinic visits will occur on Day 1 of Cycles 1 7and on Day [ADDRESS_1144058] cycle (i.e., screening/baseline and Day [ADDRESS_1144059] cycle from 
Cycle18for patients with 17cycles of vemurafenib on an antecedent study )until 
unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, as defined by [CONTACT_093] .  In patients with 
measurable disease, tumor assessments will be conducted for purposes of evaluating whether 
treatment should be discontinued via routine tumor assessments ( computed tomography 
[CT]/magnetic resonance imaging ) consistent with institutional standards of care, as outlined in 
the Schedule of Assessments.
Tumor assessments as specified and conducted in the antecedent protocol, including any 
evaluable and measurable disease, will have been documented at screening in the antecedent 
protocol .  In the extension (rollover) study, tumor assessments, including radiological tumor 
assessments of chest, abdome n, pelvis for measuring extent or progression of disease 
(CTscan is the preferred method) will be done at the discretion of the investigator according to 
local institutional standard of care for purposes of evaluating whether treatment should be 
discontin ued.  
Safety evaluations will also be conducted during the study.  Safety evaluations will begin on 
Day1 of the study and will continue throughout the study until [ADDRESS_1144060] .  Adverse events related to the study medication will be monitored until 
resolution.  The tolerability and toxicity (safety) profile of vemurafenib will be evaluated using the 
National Cancer In stitute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ), 
Version 4.0.
Target Population
The target population includes patients with BRAFV600mutation positive malignancy  
(including metastatic melanoma or other cancer types) who were previously enrolled and 
treated in an antecedent vemurafenib protocol and did not meet the protocol’s criteria for 
disease progression orare being treated beyond progression and still deriving clinical benefit, 
as assessed by [CONTACT_825094].  Patients with malignant tumor types other than malignant melanoma harboring a 
V600 -activating mutation of BRAF who have no acceptable standard treatment options will also 
be allowed to participate in the trial.
Inclusion Criteria
A patient may be included if he or she meets all of the following criteria:
Disease -Specific Inclusion Criteria:
1.BRAFV600mutation -positive malignanc y
2.Prior eligibility for and received study  treatment onan antecedent vemurafenib 
protocol
3.Ability to begin treatment in the extension (rollover) protocol within [ADDRESS_1144061] day of the study in the antecedent prot ocol
General Inclusion Criteria:
1.Signed Informed Consent Form(s)
2.Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of 
childbearing potential must agree to always use two adequate methods of contraception 
including at least one meth od with a failure rate of 1% per year during the course of 
this study and for at least 6 months after completion of study treatment.
Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without 
prior hysterectom y who have had any eviden ce of me nses in the past [ADDRESS_1144062] occurred in the absence of chemotherapy, anti -
estrogen therapy, or ovarian suppression.
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 13Effective forms of contraception include surgical sterilization, a reliable barrier 
method with spermicide, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], contraceptive hormone implants, or 
vasectomized partner.
3.Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day s prior to commencement of dosing in 
women o f childbearing potential; women of non -childbearing potential may  be included 
if they are either surgically sterile or have been naturally menopausal for 1year.  
Women of non -childbearing potential need not undergo the pregnancy test.
Exclusion Criteri a
Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry:
1.Adverse event requiring discontinuation of vemurafenib in the antecedent protocol
2.Progressive disease during the antecedent protocol.  If approval to treat beyond 
progress ion was already given in the antecedent protocol, the patient may roll over into 
the current protocol without Sponsor’s approval.  Under special circumstances, when it 
is felt that the patient may clinically benefit from continued therapy with vemurafenib,
enrollment into this protocol and dosing beyond progression may  be considered if it is 
judged by [CONTACT_093], in consultation with the Sponsor, to be in the best interest of 
the patient.  All such cases will require approval of the Sponsor before enr olling the 
patient into this protocol.
3.Meeting any of the following exclusion criterion of the antecedent study at the time the 
patient is considered for the extension (rollover) study:
Current, recent (within 28 days prior to Day 1), or planned use of any anti-tumor 
therapy outside of this study
Any other serious concomitant medical conditions that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the patient’s 
ability to participate in the study
History of malabsorption or other clinically significant metabolic dysfunctions
History of clinically significant cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction as specified in 
antecedent study
Length of Study
Treatment will continue until disease progression (as defined by [CONTACT_113634]) or as long as the 
patient is deriving clinical benefit, as assessed by [CONTACT_1697], if treated beyond progression 
(case -by-case decision discussed and approved by [CONTACT_1689]), death, withdrawal of 
consent, unacceptable toxicity, loss to follow -up, or decision of the Sponsor to terminate the 
study, whichever occurs first.
End of Study
The study will end when all enrolled patients have discontinued study treatment and have been 
followed for safety assessment until 28days after the last dos e of study drug , death, 
withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up, or if the Sponsor has decided to terminate the study, 
whichever occurs first.

Protocol GO28399, Version 5 171. BACKGROUND
1.1 BACKGROUND ON BRAFV600-POSITIVE MALIGNA NCY 
BRAF is a human gene that makes a protein called B -Raf.  The B -Raf protein is involved 
in sending signals inside cells, which are involved in directing cell growth. 
Some mutations in the BRAF gene result in constitutively activated BRAF proteins, 
which can ca use cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors that would normally 
be required for proliferation.  In 2002, the BRAF gene was shown to be mutated in 
human cancers (Davies et al. 2002).  Specifically, oncogenic mutations in BRAF kinase, 
predominant ly V600E, have been observed in approximately 8% of all solid tumors, 
including 50% of metastatic melanomas, 30% to 70% of thyroid carcinomas, 30% of 
ovarian carcinomas, and 10% of colorectal carcinomas  (Davies et al. 2002; 
Fransen etal. 2004; Garnett and Marais 2004; Libra et al. 2005).
Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) (Zelboraf [vemurafenib] U.S. Package Insert), a low molecular 
weight, orally available inhibitor of some mutated forms of BRAF serine -threonine kinase, 
including BRAFV600E, was approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 
17August [ADDRESS_1144067] 
(Zelboraf [vemurafenib] U.S. Package Insert).  Vemurafenib was appr oved in Europe on 
17February 2012 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
BRAFV600mutation positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  Vemurafenib is also 
approved or has been submitted for approval in other countries.  Vemurafenib app roval 
was based primarily on Study NO25026, an international, randomized, open -label trial in 
patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma with the 
BRAFV600Emutation, as detected by [CONTACT_267515][ADDRESS_1144068] ([COMPANY_002] 
Molecular Systems, Inc. ).  
1.[ADDRESS_1144069] identified the role of 
BRAF kinase.  Mutated BRAF dimers constitutively activate the mitogen -activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway leading to the generation of transcriptional signaling that 
promotes tumor growth.  BRAF mutations have been identified in 50% to 68% of 
metastatic melanomas, specifically melanomas that arise from intermittent sun -exposed 
skin (e.g., superficial spreadin g and nodular melanomas [ Maldonado et al. 2003; 
Beeram et al. 2005; Curtin et al. 2005; Lang and Mackie 2005 ]).  BRAF mutations are 
uncommon in acral, mucosal, and uveal melanomas.  In addition, BRAF mutations are 
common in benign nevi, suggesting that the y are an early event in melanoma 
oncogenesis.  About 90% of the BRAF mutations seen in metastatic melanoma occur in 
codon V600, and more than 90% of the V600 mutations involve the substitution of valine 
for glutamate at amino acid 600 of the BRAF kinase (i .e., V600E; 1799 T A 
[Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)] ).  Other uncommon variants 
such as V600K, V600R, and V600D (in order of decreasing frequency) have also been

mutated BRAF by [CONTACT_825096] (Sumimoto et al. 2004).  This has led to the development of agents that can 
inhibit mutated BRAF kinase as well as tests to identify V600 mutations (Flaherty 2006; 
Ascierto et al. 2010; Vultur et al. 2011).
1.2.1 Vemurafenib (RO5185426) BRA F Inhibitor
Vemurafenib is a low molecular weight, orally available inhibitor of some mutated forms 
of BRAF serine- threonine kinase, including BRAFV600E.  See the Vemurafenib 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for additional details .

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Vemurafenib
The clinical pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib are based on data available from 
sixstudie s in patients who received the commercial formulation : PLX06 -02, the initial 
Phase I dose -escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) : 
Study NP22676 , a cytochrome P450 metabolism study in patients with BRAFV600E
mutation positive Stage IV melanoma; Study NP25158, a mass -balance study in 
patients with BRAFV600mutation positive Stage IV melanoma; Study NP25163, a 
dose- escalation study in patient s with BRAFV600Emutation positive unresectable 
Stage IIIcor Stage IV melanoma; Study NP22657, a Phase II, open -label study in 
patients with BRAFV600Emutation positive Stage IV melanoma, in which the effects of 
vemurafenib on the QT interval were evaluated; and Study NO25026, a Phase III, 
randomized controlled study in p atients with BRAFV600Emutation positive unresectable 
Stage IIIc or IV melanoma.  Detailed descriptions of the design and PK results for each 
of these studies are provided in the Vemurafenib IB.
On the basis of dose -limiting toxicities reported at the 1120 -mg twice daily (BID) dose 
level in Study PLX06 -02, the 960- mg BID dose was considered the MTD and selected 
for use in all subsequent clinical trial s, including the Phase I ( Study PLX06 -02; 
Vemurafenib IB; Flah erty et al. 2010) treatment -extension cohorts, as well as the 
aforementioned clinical pharmacology studies, and the Phase II ( Study NP22657; 
Vemurafenib IB; Sosman etal.2012) and Phase III ( Study NO25026; Vemurafenib IB; 
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 19Chapman et al. 2011) studies in p atients with unresectable Stage IIIc or metastatic 
melanoma .
Population PK analysis with the use of pooled data from 458 patients estimated the 
median of the steady -state maximum plasma concentration (C max), the minimum plasma 
concentration (C min), and are a under the concentration -time curve from 0 to 12 hours 
(AUC 0-12hr) to be 62 g/mL, 59 g/mL, and 734 g/mL hour, respectively.  The 
pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib have been shown to be dose proportional between 
240and 960 mg BID, and a population PK analysis also confirmed that the 
pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib are linear. The median of the individual elimination 
half-life estimate for vemurafenib is 57 hours (the 5thand 95 thpercentile range is 
30120hours). 
Vemurafenib at 960 mg BID as a 240 -mg tablet is absorbed with a median time to 
maximum concentration (t max) of approximately 4 hours.  Vemurafenib exhibits marked 
accumulation after repeat dosing at 960 mg BID, with high inter -patient variability.  On 
the basis of the population PK analysis, the median accumulation ratio estimate for the 
BID regimen is 7.36.  In the Phase II study, mean plasma vemurafenib concentrations 
4hours postdose increased from 3.6 g/mL on Day 1 to 49.0 g/mL on Day 15 
(range: 5.4118 g/mL). 
At steady state, the mean vemurafenib exposure in plasma is stable (concentrations 
predose and 2 4 hours after the morning dose), as indicated by [CONTACT_267526] 1.13.  
Relatively high marked inter -patient variability in plasma exposure (area under the 
plasma concentration- time curve [ AUC]; range: 3246%) was observed at the 
steady -state dose reduction. 
Following oral dosing, the absorption rate constant for the population of metastatic 
melanoma patients was estimated to be 0.19 hr1(with 101% intra -patient variability). 
The apparent volume of distribution for vemurafenib in patients with metastatic 
melanoma on the basis of population PK analysis is estimated to be 91 L (with 64.8% 
intra-patient variability).  Vemurafenib is highly bound to human plasma proteins in vitro 
(99%). 
The relative proportions of vemurafenib and its metabolites were characterized in a 
human mass -balance study.  On average, 95% of the dose was recovered within 
18days, the majority (94%) in feces, with 1% recovered in urine.  The parent 
compound was the predominant component (95%) in plasma (refer to the 
Vemurafenib IB).  CYP3A4 is identified as the primary enzyme responsible for 
vemurafenib metabolism.
The commercial dosage form of vemurafenib is a 240- mg film -coated tablet.

Protocol GO28399, Version 5 [IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  of Vemurafenib in Patients with BRAFV600E
Mutation Positive Metastatic Melanoma
Study NO25026 was a Phase III, open -label, multicenter, international study of 
vemurafenib in previously untreated patients with BRAFV600Emutat ion–positive 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  Patients were randomized to treatment with 
vemurafenib (960 mg BID) or dacarbazine (DTIC) (1000 mg/m2every 3 weeks).
A total of 675 patients were randomized to receive vemurafenib (n 337) or DTIC 
(n338; Vemurafenib IB).  Randomization was stratified according to disease stage, 
serum LDH level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance S tatus, 
and geographic region.  Baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment 
groups.  Of the patients randomized to receive vemurafenib, most patients were male 
(59%) and Caucasian (99%), the median age was 56 years (28% were 65 yea rs old), 
all patients had ECOG P erformance Status of 0 or 1, and the majority of patients (66%) 
had Stage M1c disease.
The co -primary efficacy endpoints of the study were overall survival (OS) and 
progression -free survival (PFS).  Key secondary endpoints included confirmed best 
overall response rate (BORR) and response duration.
Statistically significant and clini cally meaningful improvements were observed in OS 
(p0.0001) and PFS (p 0.0001, by [CONTACT_825097] -rank test).  OS was longer with 
vemurafenib treat ment compared with DTIC, with a hazard ratio of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.26, 
0.55), which represents a 63% decre ase in the hazard of death with vemurafenib 
compared with DTIC ( Vemurafenib IB).  Kaplan Meier estimates of the 6 -month survival 
rates were 84% (95% CI: 78%, 89%) for vemurafenib and 64% (95% CI: 56%, 73%) for 
DTIC.  Consistent improvement in OS, PFS, an d confirmed BORR in favor of 
vemurafenib treatment was generally observed across subgroups defined by [CONTACT_654], sex, 
baseline serum LDH level, ECOG Performance S tatus, metastatic disease stage, and 
geographic region.  Ninety -four patients (28%) treated with vem urafenib in the 
aforementioned Phase III study were 65 years old.  The effects of vemurafenib on OS, 
PFS, and confirmed BORR were similar for patients 65 and 65years old.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  of Vemurafenib
The safety evaluation of vemurafenib is based on results in patients from 
three Genentech clinical pharmacology studies ( Study NP22676, n 25; Study NP25163, 
n52; and Study NP25158, n 7), a Phase I study ( Study PLX06 -02, n 108; 
Vemurafenib IB), a single -arm, Phase II study in previously treated patients with 
BRAFV600mutation positive Stage IV melanoma ( Study NP22657, n 132; Vemurafenib 
IB), and a Phase III, randomized, open- label, multicenter, global study in patients with 
unresectable Stage IIIC or St age IV BRAFV600mutation positive melanoma 
(Study NO25026 , n675; Vemurafenib IB).  The type and incidence of adverse events 
observed across all studies in patients with BRAFV600mutation positive unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma were consistent.
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 21In the clinical pharmacology S tudy NP25163, all 52 patients (100%) had at least one 
adverse event.  Nearly all patients (96%) had at least one treatment -related adverse 
event.  The majority of adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity.  The most 
commo n adverse events (reported in 30% of patients) in the vemurafenib group were 
fatigue (58%), arthralgia (58%), nausea (50%), rash (38%), and diarrhea (33%).  
Fifty-four percent of patients had at least on e Grade 3 adverse event; 40% of patients 
had at l east one treatment -related adverse event.  The most commonly reported 
treatment -related adverse events (incidence 5%) were squamous cell carcinoma ( SSC)
of skin (23%), increased gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT; 9%), basal cell carcinoma 
(BCC; 7%), rash ( 7%), maculopapular rash (6%), and arthralgia (6%).  Twelve patients 
(23%) experienced at least one Grade [ADDRESS_1144071] frequent 
Grade 4 adverse event was increased GGT (n 5 patients, assessed as related to 
treatment in 4 patients ).  The other Grade 4 adverse events were hyperuricemia 
(assessed as related to tre atment) and pneumonia, sepsis, convulsion, pseudomonas 
infection, staphylococcal infection, multi -organ failure, and pulmonary embolism (all of
which were assessed as unrelated to study treatment).
Study PLX06 -02 (Vemurafenib IB)assessed the safety of esc alating doses of 
vemurafenib.  At the highest dose administered (1120 mg BID), dose- limiting rash 
(National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
[NCICTCAE] Grade 3) and fatigue (Grade 3) were observed in multiple patients.  
Vemu rafenib doses of up to 960 mg BID (the MTD) were generally well tolerated.
In the Ph ase II clinical trial ( Study NP22657; Vemurafenib IB), all patients experienced at 
least one adverse event, the most common of which were arthralgia (68%), fatigue 
(57%), r ash (54%), photosensitivity (52%), nausea (42%), alopecia (38%), pruritus 
(32%), diarrhea (32%), skin papi[INVESTIGATOR_81875] (31%), and hyperkeratosis (30%) .  Seventy -three 
percent of patients experienced at least one Grade [ADDRESS_1144072] one Grade [ADDRESS_1144073] 
commonly reported, treatment -related adverse events (incidence 5%) were squamous 
cell carcinoma ( SCC) of skin (23%), increased serum GGT (9%), BCC (7%), rash (7%), 
maculopapular rash (6%), and arthralgia (6%).  The Vemurafenib IBsummarizes the 
Grade 3 or 4 study drug related adverse events observed in Study NP22657.
In the Phase III randomized study of vemurafenib versus DTIC (BRIM -3, 
Study NO25026, clinical cutoff:  1 March 2011; Vemurafenib IB), the safety results 
showed that vemurafenib was generally tolerable and toxicity was manageable with 
dose modifications.  Ninety -nine percent and ninety -one percent of patients in the 
vemurafenib and DTIC t reatment groups, respectively, experienced a t least one adverse 
event.  The majority of adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity.  The most 
common adverse events (reported in 30% of patients) in the vemurafenib group were 
in the system organ class of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders ; the most common 
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 22of which were alopecia, rash, and photosensitivity.  Other adverse events that occurred 
in10% of vemurafenib- treated patients and at an incidence of more than twi ce that 
observed in the DTIC group included SCC of skin, skin papi[INVESTIGATOR_81875], arthralgia, headache, 
dysgeusia, pyrexia, peripheral edema, pain in extremity, myalgia, decreased appetite, 
diarrhea, hyperkeratosis, seborrheic keratosis, and dry skin. Of the 37 patients who 
switched from DTIC to vemurafenib, 32 patients (86%) had at least one adverse event 
and 26 patients (70%) reported at least one treatment -related adverse event.  The 
majority of adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity.
Fifty-nine perce nt of patients in the vemurafenib arm and thirty -three percent of patients 
in the DTIC arm experienced one or more adverse events of Grade 3 in intensity.  
Treatment -related adverse events of Grade 3 occurred in 49% of patients in the 
vemurafenib arm a nd 20% in the DTIC arm.  Sixteen percent and nine percent of 
vemurafenib- treated patients had cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) and 
keratoacanthoma (KA), respectively, compared with 1% and 0% for DTIC -treated 
patients.  For reporting purposes, al l cases of cuSCC and KA were considered to be 
treatment related, Grade 3, and serious.  Other common Grade 3 adverse events in the 
vemurafenib group included photosensitivity reaction (9%), rash (8%), maculopapular 
rash (8%), and arthralgia (4%); the cor responding frequency of these adverse events in
the DTIC group were 0%, 0%, 0%, and1%.  The most common Grade 3 adverse 
event in the DTIC group was neutropenia, occurring in 9% of patients; 1% of patients 
inthevemurafenib gro up experienced neutropenia.  Of the 37 patients who crossed over 
from DTIC to vemurafenib, 11 (30%) experienced one or more Grade 3 adverse 
event aftercrossover.  These events consisted of fatigue (2 patients), muscle weakness, 
pyrexia, anemia, hyperker atosis, BCC, maculopapular rash, rash, cellulitis, 
palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and d ecreased neutrophil counts 
(all1patient each).  Of these, eight events were considered by [CONTACT_825098].
The percentage of pati ents who experienced one or more Grade 4 adverse event was 
lower in the vemurafenib group (13 patients [4%]) than in the DTIC group (22 patients 
[8%]).  Grade 4 adverse events in the vemurafenib group included pulmonary embolism
(3patients), increased GGT (2 patients), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK), 
increased blood bilirubin, increased lipase, ageusia, intraventricular hemorrhage, 
pneumonia, pneumothorax, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], and neutropenia (1 patient each).  
Five patients treated with vem urafenib had a total of six Grade 4 adverse events that 
were assessed as related to treatment (increased blood bilirubin, GGT increased 
[2patients], ageusia, increased CPK, and neutropenia).  One of the 37 patients who 
crossed over experienced a Grade 4 decreased neutrophil count after crossover.  It was 
assessed as unrelated to treatment and non -serious.
Grade 5 adverse events were reported in 6 patients (2%) in the vemurafenib group.  
Only one adverse event (intracranial tumor hemorrhage) was assessed as treatment
related.  Each of the other 5 patients experienced the following Grade 5 adverse events 
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 23(all unrelated to study treatment):  general physical health deterioration, cerebrovascular 
accident, pneumonia, aortic aneurysm rupture, and cardiac failure.  Grade 5 adverse 
events were reported in 8 DTIC -treated patients (3%).  Fatigue and mucosal 
inflammation, initially classified as Grade 5 adverse events in 1 patient, were 
subsequently considered to be symptoms of disease progression and downgrade d to 
Grade 1, resulting in a total of 7 patients with Grade 5 adverse events.  Only one 
adverse event (shock) was assessed a s treatment related.  D yspnea, lung infection, 
cardiac arrest, and cardiac tamponade were reported in 1 patient each, and 
cardiopulm onary failure was reported in 2 patients.  No Grade 5 adverse events were 
reported in the 37 patients who crossed over from DTIC to vemurafenib.
The incidence of cuSCC in vemurafenib -treated patients was approximately 20% across 
studies.  The majority of t he excised lesions reviewed by [CONTACT_267528] KA subtype or with mixed KA 
features (52%), both of which are less invasive types of cuSCC.  Most lesions classified 
as “other” (43%) were benign skin lesions (e.g., verruca vulgaris, actinic keratosis, 
benign keratosis, cyst/benign cyst).  cuSCC usually occurred early in the course of 
treatment, with a median time to the first appearance of 7 8 weeks.  Of the patients who 
experienced cuSCC, approximately 33% experienced more than one occurrence, with a 
median time between occurrences of [ADDRESS_1144074] computed tomography (CT) scans, has been established to 
monitor for and treat SCC (both cutaneous and non -cutaneous) in patients receiving 
vemurafenib in clinical trials (see Section5.1.2.3).
Eight skin lesions in 7 of 337 vemurafenib -treated patients were reported as new primary 
malignant melanomas in Study N O25026 ( Vemurafenib IB).  No cases were reported in 
338patients treated with DTIC.  Cases were managed with excision and without 
sequelae, and patients continued treatment without dose adjustment.  Surveillance 
measures to monitor for the occurrence of ne w primary melanomas as well as cuSCC 
are outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Severe dermatologic reactions have been reported in patients receiving vemurafenib, 
including rare cases of Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]. One 
notable treatment related serious adverse event occurred in a vemurafenib- treated 
patient in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_25646] ( Study NO25026) afte r the [ADDRESS_1144075] report.  
The patient was discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825077].
As of 31 March 2013, 12 cases of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic 
symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been observed with vemurafenib treatment.  
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version [ADDRESS_1144076] been reported.  The time to onset was 7 to 25 days.  In the majority 
of patients (n 7), vemurafenib was discontinued.  Some patients (n 5) were treated 
with sys temic steroids with corresponding improvement or resolution of symptoms.  
Inaddition, 2 patients who were treated with vemurafenib after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_825078] 3 rash and had biopsies that showed pathology consistent with drug 
hypersensitivity reaction (Harding et al. 2012).  Full details are provided in the current 
Vemurafenib IB. 
Two cases of SCC of the head and neck have been reported in 2 patients treated with 
vemurafenib in excess of 300 days while enrolled in a clinical trial.  Pathology 
exam ination of both tumors (one a primary tonsillar tumor, the other a primary tongue 
tumor) revealed the presence of invasive SCC.  Of note, the first patient’s medical 
history was significant for risk factors for head and neck cancer and the tumor tissue 
tested positive for human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV).  The second patient does not appear to 
possess any risk factors for head and neck cancer, and the preliminary examination of 
the tumor tissue did not reveal the presence of HPV genome.  Full details are provi ded 
in the current Vemurafenib IB.
Five cases of adenomatous colonic polyps have been reported in patients who received 
vemurafenib for more than 2 years (Chapman et al. 2012).  The first patient developed 
an upper gastrointestinal bleed, and ,on work -up,was found to have duodenal ulceration 
(non-malignant), hyperplastic gastric polyps, and five colonic polyps (three of which were 
adenomatous).  A previous colonoscopy in 2008, at the time of a jejunal resection for 
recurrent melanoma, documented no prior evidence of colonic polyps.  All polyps were 
resected, and the patient subsequently resumed vemurafenib therapy.  The second 
patient was found, on elective colonoscopy, to have seven colonic polyps (five of which 
were adenomatous), and all were detected and removed.  This patient had not 
unde rgone a previous colonoscopy.  The third patient had, on elective colonoscopy, 
10colonic polyps ( 7 of which were adenomatous).  This pati ent had a previous 
colonoscopy 7 years prior to starting vemurafenib.  The fourth patient had, on elective 
colonoscopy, one adenomatous colonic polyp.  The fifth patient had, on elective 
colonoscopy, three adenomatous colonic polyps.  The latte r two patients had histories of 
no prior colonoscopy.  In addition, a patient i n the Expanded Access Program had one 
colonic adenoma discovered after treatment with vemurafenib for 0.57 years.  This 
patient had a colonoscopy 1.3 years prior to starting vemurafenib, and a polyp was 
found and resected at that time.
One case of progression of NRAS -mutated chronic myelomonocytic leukemia occurred 
in a male patient with metastatic melanoma treated with vemurafenib for less than 
2weeks (Callahan et al. 2012).  After the first dose of vemurafenib, laboratory results 
showed a marked leukocytosis and monoc ytosis, and vemurafenib treatment was 
subsequently held. There was a temporal relationship between vemurafenib treatment 
and increase in W BC and absolute monocyte counts through multiple cycles of 
dechallenge and rechallenge.  In vitro studies demonstrate d proliferation of the leukemic 
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version [ADDRESS_1144077] that was reversed upon 
addition of MEK inhibitor.  Further, the cells exhibited dose -dependent and reversible 
activation of extracellular -signal -regulated kinase ( ERK)in the NRAS -mutated leukemic 
clone.  A second case of progression of a preexisting RAS -mutated malignancy 
(pancreatic adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutation) was reported with vemurafenib in 
2014. On the basis of its mechanism of action, vemurafenib may cause progression of 
cancers associated with RAS mutations.  Vemurafenib should be used with caution in 
patients with a prior or concurrent cancer associated with RAS mutation.  Full details are 
provided in the cur rent Vemurafenib IB.
In a Phase I trial ( Study CA 184161, sponsored by [CONTACT_414] -Myers Squibb), asymptomatic 
Grade 3 increases in transaminases and bilirubin occurred with concurrent 
administration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg BID or 720 m g BID) 
(Ribas et al. 2012).  All liver laboratory abnormalities were asymptomatic and reversible 
with permanent discontinuation of the study drugs or, in some cases, administration of 
corticosteroids.  On the basis of these data, concurrent administration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_267474] a clinical trial.  Full details are provided in 
the current Vemurafenib IB. 
An analysis of li ver-related adverse events reported with vemurafenib use showed that 
63cases (out of an estimated exp osure of approximately 20,000 patients) of medically
confirmed serious adverse event s were consistent with drug- induced liver injury on the 
basis of clinical chemistry criteria from the Drug -Induced Liver Injury Expert W orking 
Group (Aithal et al. 2011) .  Of the 63 cases, two were assessed as severe ; both were 
reported as hepatic failure, and the outcomes of both cases are considered resolved . 
There were no reported deaths among the 63 cases of liver injury. The median time to 
onset of the adverse events was 44 days after initial dose.  The median ALT to alkaline 
phosphatase ( ALP)ratio was calculated as 1.5, suggesting a trend toward cholestatic 
pattern of liver injury. The analysis did not reveal any risk factors or populations at risk.
A review of the [COMPANY_002] safety database found neutropenia to be an uncommon (6 cases 
per 1000 person -years, 0.6%) adverse drug reaction associated with the use of 
vemurafenib, typi[INVESTIGATOR_825079] 6 12 weeks of treatment. Neutropenia
appeared to be reversible, usually within 2 weeks , with temporary interruption, dose 
reduction ,or discontinuation of vemurafenib and ,in some cases ,was managed with 
granu locyte colony stimulating factor ( GCSF ).
The effects of vemurafenib on the QT interval were invest igated as part of the Phase II 
Study NP22657 ( Vemurafenib IB).  This was not a “thorough” QT study as defined by 
[CONTACT_825099] a positive or negativ e control to patients with 
metastatic melanoma.  However, the centrally read ECG data obtained in triplicate at 
serial, time -matched points before and after dosing met the regulatory expectations for 
robust assessment of oncology therapeutics on the QT int erval.  The maximum 
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 26absolute corrected QT (QTc)values at any point after dosing were as follows:   450 
millisecond ( ms), 49 patients (37.1%); 480 ms, 6 patients (4.5%); 500 ms (Grade 3), 
2patients (1.5%).  One patient (0.8%) had a maximal QTc increment 60 ms (Grade 2) 
compared with baseline.  The upper boundary of the one -sided 95% CI for mean QTc 
prolongation reached a maximum of 17.7 ms on Day 105 of study treatment, based on
measurements in 90 patients.  Mean QTc interval prolongation clos ely tracked with the 
mean vemurafenib steady -state concentration over time.  None of the QT prolongation 
events were serious or led to premature withdrawal from treatment or dose 
modification/interruption; none were clearly associated with prolongation of cardiac 
repolarization, arrhythmia, or any other cardiac function disorder.  Additional information 
on the relationship between vemurafenib exposure and QT interval prolongation may be 
found in the Vemurafenib IB.
As of Q2 2014, an adverse drug reaction of pancreatitis has been identified in patients 
treated with vemurafenib.  Seventeen cases of pancreatitis with no strong risk factors 
oralternative explanations were reported.  Eight of the seventeen cases were assessed 
aslikely associated with vemurafeni b use on the basis of event onset latency and 
rechallenge/dechallenge information.  The clinical presentation including mild to 
moderate severity was consistent with the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_267475] -induced pancreatitis 
(Lankisch et al. 1995).  
As of Q4 2014, an adverse drug reaction of potentiation of radiation treatment toxicity 
has been identified in patients treated with radiation either prior, during, or subsequent to 
vemurafenib treatment.  This is based on twenty cases of radiation injuries, adjudicated
as radiation recall (n 8) and radiation sensitization (n 12).  The nature and severity of 
the events in all [ADDRESS_1144078] been characterized by [CONTACT_825100] (some observed in the setting of dehydration
events), with recovery after dose modification. Serum creatinine will be monitored 
throughout the study. Vemurafenib acute kidney injury dose modification guidelines 
should be used when applicable, and it is recommended to routinely monitor serum 
creatinine levels in all patients undergoing vemurafenib therapy.
Dupuytren’s contracture and plantar fascial fibromatosis have been reported with 
vemurafenib.  The majority of cases were Grade 1 or 2, but severe, disabling cases of 
Dupuytren’s contracture have also been reported.

This is an open -label, multicenter, non -randomized study to provide continued access to 
vemurafenib for eligible patients with BRAFV600mutation positive malignancy (including 
metastatic melanoma and other cancer types) who were previously enrolled and treated 
in an antecedent vemurafenib study protocol without meeting the protocol’s criteria for 
disease progression or are being treated beyond progression and still deriving clinical 
benefit, as assesse d by [CONTACT_1697].  
Safety evaluations will be conducted during the study.  Safety evaluations will begin on

The primary objective of this study is to provide continued access to vemurafenib for 
eligible patients with BRAFV600mutation positive malignancy who were previously 
treated in an antecedent vemurafenib protocol and did not meet the protocol’s criteria for 
disease progression or are being treated beyond progression and still deriving clinical 
benefit, as assessed by [CONTACT_1697] ,and may potentially benefit from continued
treatment with vemurafenib.

who continue vemurafenib treatment in this extension (rollover) study.
3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY
3.1.1 Overview
This is an open -label, multicenter, non -randomized study to provide continued access to 
vemurafenib for eligible patients with BRAFV600mutation positive malignancy who were 
previously enrolled and treated in an antecedent vemurafenib protocol and did not meet 
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 28the protocol’s criteria for disease progression or are being treated beyond progression 
and still deriving clinical benefit (as assessed by [CONTACT_093]) and may therefore 
potentially benefit from continued treatment with vemurafenib. The maximum number of 
days between the last dose of study drug in the antecedent protocol and first dose in 
this extension ( rollover) study will be 15 days.  Results of the study completion visit or 
other visit in the antecedent protocol may be used as screening/baseline for this 
extension (rollover) study .  Screening/baseline is combined into one visit if completed 
within time intervals ,as specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix 1. The first 
vemurafenib treatment in the extension (rollover) study w ill be recorded as Cycle 1, 
Day1.  Patients will receive treatment with oral vemurafenib at [ADDRESS_1144081] dose in the antecedent protocol.  Treatment will 
continue until progression of disease or as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit, 
as judged by [CONTACT_093] (case -by-case decision with approval of the Medical
Monitor), death, withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, loss to follow -up, or 
decision of the Sponsor to terminate the study, whichever occurs first.
One cycle is defined as 28 days.  Clinic visits will occur on Day 1 of Cycles 1 7and on 
Day1 of every other cycle through Cycle [ADDRESS_1144082] cycle ( i.e., screening /baseline and Day1 of 
every third cycle from Cycle 18 [see Appendix 1] for patients with 17cycles of 
vemurafenib on an antecedent study )until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, 
as defined by [CONTACT_093] .  In patients with measurable disease, tumor assessments 
will be conducted for purposes of evaluating whether treatment should be discontinued 
via routine tumor assessments (CT/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) consistent with 
institutional standards of c are, as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (see 
Appendix 1).  
Tumor assessments as specified and conducted in the antecedent protoc ol, including 
any evaluable and measurable disease, will have been documented at screening in the 
antecedent protocol .  In the extension (rollover) study, tumor assessments, including 
radiological tumor assessments of chest, abdomen, and pelvis (C/A/P) for measuring 
extent or progression of disease (CT scan is the preferred method) will be done at the 
discretion of the investigator according to local institutional standard of care for purposes 
of evaluating whether treatment should be discontinued.
Safety evaluations will also be conducted during the study. Safety evaluations will begin 
on Day [ADDRESS_1144083] .  Adverse events related to the study medication 
will be monitored until resolution.  The tolerability and toxicity (safety) profile of 
vemurafenib will be evaluated using the NCI CTCAE , Version 4.0. 
The target population includes patients with BRAFV600mutation positive malignancy 
(including metastatic melanoma or other cancer types) who were previously enrolled and 
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 29treated in an antecedent vemurafenib protocol and did not meet the protocol’s criteria for
disease progression or are being treated beyond progression and still deriving clinical 
benefit, as assessed by [CONTACT_825101]. Patients with malignant tumor types other than m alignant 
melanoma harboring a V600 -activating mutation of BRAF who have no acceptable 
standard treatment options will also be allowed to participate in the trial. 
3.2 LENGTH OF STUDY
Treatment will continue until disease progression (as defined by [CONTACT_1697]) or as long 
as the patient is deriving clinical benefit, as assessed by [CONTACT_1697], if treated beyond 
progression (case -by-case decision discussed and approved by [CONTACT_22951] M onitor), 
death, withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, loss tofollow -up, or decision of the 
Sponsor to terminate the study, whichever occurs first.

Protocol GO28399, Version 5 344.4.2 Prohibited Therapy
Use of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_27789] (i.e., fro m 7 days before the 
initiation of vemurafenib treatment [ on Study GO28399] until the end of treatment visit):
St. John’s wort or hyperforin
Any concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (approved by [CONTACT_825104]), inclu ding chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, investigational agents, or 
herbal therapy; certain forms of radiation therapy may be considered for pain 
palliation following consultation with the medical monitor.  S tudy treatment should be 
suspended during radiation therapy.  Undergoing radiation therapy 1week prior to 
first administration of vemurafenib and stereotactic radiotherapy is prohibited. 
Patients who require the use of any of these agents will be discontinued from study 
treatment and followed for safety outcomes for [ADDRESS_1144096].  
Follow -up for new primary malignancies will continue per inves tigator ’s discretion.
4.4.3 Medication Precautions in Case of Drug -Drug Interactions
[IP_ADDRESS] Vemurafenib
Results from a drug- drug interaction study in patients with metastatic melanoma 
demonstrated no interaction of vemurafenib with CYP2C19 and CYP2C9.  However, 
drug interactions were observed with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4.
CYP1A2 inhibition was observed when a single dose of caffeine (a CYP1A2 substrate) 
was co -administered after repeat dosing with vemurafenib for 15 days, resulting in a 
2.6fold increase in the mean AUC of caffeine.
CYP3A4 induction was observed when a single dose of midazolam (a CYP3A4 
substrate) was co -administered after repeat dosing with vemurafenib for 15 days, 
resulting in a 39% decrease in the mean AUC of midazolam.
An interaction between vemurafenib and dextromethorphan (a CYP2D6 substrate) was 
suggested by a mean increase in dextromethorphan AUC 0-lastof 47% based on the no 
effect 90% CI boundary.  However, this interaction is not likely to be the result of the 
inhibition of CYP2D6 by [CONTACT_825105], because the AUC 0-lastof the dextromethorphan 
metabolite dextrorphan also increased by 46%.
In nonclinical in vitro evaluation, the concentration for 50% inhibition of vemurafenib to 
CYP2C9 was 5.9 M.  When a single dose of warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) was
co-administered after repeat dosing with vemurafenib for 15 days, some patients 
exhibited increased warfarin exposure (mean 18% for S -warfarin).
In summary, vemurafenib may increase the plasma exposure of drugs predominantly 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]1A2 and decr ease the plasma exposure of drugs predominantly 
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version [ADDRESS_1144097] of drug interaction.
Caution should be exercised when vemurafenib is co- administered with warfarin 
(CYP2C9) in patients with melanoma (see prohibited concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_330734] 4.4.2 ).  
No dose adjustment is recommended for drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6 or CYP2C19.
Less than 10% of metabolites of vemurafenib were detected in plasma in nonclinical 
studies and in clinical data from a mass -balance study with 14C -vemurafenib in patients 
with melanoma (Study NP25158).  Nonclinical studies suggest that CYP3A4 metabolism 
and subsequent glucuronidation are responsible for the metabolism of vemurafenib.  
Noclinical data are currently available evaluating the effects of CYP3A4 inducers or 
inhibitors on vemurafenib exposure.
In vitro studies have demonstrated that vemurafenib is both a substrate and an inhibitor 
of the efflux transporter P -glycoprotein (P -gp).  In the clinical setting, the effects of 
vemurafenib on drugs that are substrates of P -gp and the effects of P -gp inducers and 
inhibitors on vemurafenib exposure are unknown.
Appendix 3includes a non -exhaustive list of typi[INVESTIGATOR_825080]1A2, CYP3A4, and 
CYP2C9 substrates and CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors.  A more extensive list of 
medications can be found online at the following link:  
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ table.aspx.  For additional information, see the 
Vemurafenib IB.  If co -administration cannot be avoided, the physician should exercise 
caution and a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 substrate drug 
should be considered. 
4.4.[ADDRESS_1144098] class (i.e., granisetron, ondansetron, dolasetron, palanosetron) 
are preferred, because the latter has the potential to prolong the QTc interval 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Patients should avoid taking medications or herbal and vitamin 
supplem ents that may increase QTc interval, and investigators should closely monitor 
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version [ADDRESS_1144099] of medications that may cause QT 
interval prolongation is provided in Appendix 4.  Refer to http://www.azcert.org/ for

4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
4.5.1 Description of Study  Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History  and Demographic Data
Medical history and demographic data will have been collected as part of the antecedent 
protocol.
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs
Vital signs will include measurements of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures while the patient is in a seated position, and oral or tympanic temperature ( C). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will in clude the measurement of patients’ weight and 
height, as well as an evaluation of the head, eye, ear, nose, and throat and the 
cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, 
genitourinary, and neurological systems. 
At subsequent visits, limited, symptom -directed physical examinations and ,at minimum, 
examination of the eyes and the cardiovascular and dermatological systems should be 
performed. 
New orworsened abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Advers e 
Event eCRF.
As part of tumor assessments, physical examinations will include an evaluation of the 
presence of enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly.  Some visits 
allow symptom -directed examinations (physical examinations relevant to the pa tient’s 
symptoms).  As part of each symptom -directed examination in this study, patients will be 
asked about skin and vision changes.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor and Response Evaluations
Any evaluable and measurable disease will have been documented as specified for 
screening in the antecedent protocol and/or according to local institution alstandards of 
care.  On -study tumor assessments will be done at the discretion of the investigator 
according to local institutional standard of care for purposes of the evaluation and 
definition of disease progression.
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 [IP_ADDRESS] Performance Status
Performance s tatus will be measured using the ECOG Performance Status scale (see 
Appendix 2).  It is recommended, where possible, that the same person ass
ess a 
patient’s performance status throughout the study .  Refer to Appendix 1for details on 
when ECOG P erformance Status will be collected.
A window of 7 days of a scheduled study visit is allowed for the assessment of the 
ECOG Performance S tatus. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safe ty Assessments
NCI CTCAE v4.0 will be used to characterize the toxicity profile of the study treatment.  
All patients will be assessed for adverse events.  After signing the Informed Consent 
Form , all adverse events and serious adverse events (i ncluding serious adverse events 
due to invasive procedures required for the study ,such as biopsies) will be collected.  
Patients will be assessed for adverse events at each study visit.  All adverse events will 
be recorded until [ADDRESS_1144100].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory  Assessments
A series of laboratory assessments will be made throughout the course of this study.  
These assessments will be performed to monitor patient safety.
Normal ranges for the study laboratory parameters, where available, must be supplied to 
[COMPANY_002]/designee before the study starts. 
The laboratory assessments listed will be performed at a local laboratory:
Hematology:  WBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, WBC differential 
count (neutrophils, bands, lymphocytes , eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes)

calcium, phosphate, magnesium, total and direct bilirubin, albumin, AST, ALT, LDH, 
ALP
Serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing p otential including premenopausal 
women who have had a tubal ligation) within [ADDRESS_1144101] dose of 
vemurafenib 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms
ECG recordings according local institutional standards will be obtained at each specified 
timepoint (see Appendix 1).  ECGs for each patient should be obtained from the same 
machine, whenever possible.  To minimize variability, it is important that patients be in a 
resting position for 10minutes prior to each ECG evaluation.  Body position should be 
consistently maintained for each ECG evaluation to prevent changes in heart rate.  
Environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be avoided 
during the pre -ECG resting period and during ECG recording.  ECGs should be

at the site.  ECG characteristics, including heart rate, QRS duration, and RR, PR, and 
QTinterva ls, will be monitored by [CONTACT_093].  If the patient experiences a Grade 3 
or Grade 4 QT prolongation (according to NCI CTCAE v4.0), the event should be 
recorded on the eCRF and reported as an expedited non -serious adverse event of 
special interest, including the QTc value.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dermatologic and Squamous Cell Carcinoma Evaluations 
Regular dermatological evaluation to s creen and monitor for cu SCC will be performed by 
a dermatologist or his/her designee with expertise in the diagnosis and management of 
cutaneous neoplasms.  A dermatological evaluation will be conducted at baseline ( the 
most current exam ination from the antecedent protocol may be utilized as the screening 
exam ination for the extension [rollover] protocol if it was conducted within 30days pri or 
to first dose of vemurafenib on Study GO28399 ), at Cycles [ADDRESS_1144103] cycle starting at 
Cycle 18(i.e., screening and every three cycles per the Cycle 18 period in the 
Schedule of Assessments [Appendix 1] for patients with 17 cycles of vemurafenib on 
an antecedent study ),at the end of treatment visit, or until withdrawal of consent, death, 
or loss to follow -up (whichever occurs earliest) .A window of 21days from the 
scheduled study visit (with exception of the baseline evaluation) is allowed for 
completion of the dermatologic assessments cited above . 
Patients should see their physicians as needed for any new skin lesions while on the 
study drug.  An unscheduled dermatology examination may be done at any time during 
treatment, if clinically indicated.
Evaluations will include the following:
A complete history of prior dermatologic medication s and cuSCC risk factors 
(i.e., radiation therapy, sun exposure, immunosuppression, prior SCC, use of 
tanning beds, precursor lesions ,and phototherapy for psoriasis) must be collected.  
(Available information of dermatological history from the antecedent study can be 
used.)
A designated dermatolo gist or his/her designee will perform skin evaluations to 
monitor for SCC, primary melanoma, BCC, actinic keratosis, and KA.

will be referred to the dermatologist as required.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  Surveillance f or Squamous Cell Carcinoma
A thorough head and neck examination to monitor for non -cutan eous SCC, consisting of 
at least a visual inspection of the oral mucosa and lymph node palpation, must be 
performed by [CONTACT_825107].  The most current exam ination from the antece dent protocol may be 
utilized as the screening exam ination for the extension (rollover) protocol if it was 
conducted within [ADDRESS_1144104] dose of vemurafenib on Study GO28399 . 
Thereafter, the head and neck examination will be repeated by [CONTACT_825108] ( 21days) after initiation of study 
treatment andevery other cycle through Cycle 15.  T hen, for patients still receiving 
treatment, the head and neck examination will continue to be conducted every third
cycle starting at Cycle 18 , (i.e., screening and every three cycles per the Cycle 18
period in the Schedule of Assessments [Appendix 1] for patients with 17 cycles of 
vemurafenib on an antecedent study ),or until withdrawal of consent, death, or loss to 
follow -up (whichever occurs earliest). 
Chest CT scans must be perform ed at baseline, within 30 days before the start of study 
treatment on Study GO28399, and then every 6 months (with a window of 21days) 
after the initiation of treatment until death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow -up, 
whichever occurs first.  Available routine chest CT scans from the antecedent study or 
those performed for tumor assessments during the study period (at the discretion of the 
investigator, per local institution alstandard of care) thatfit the required timeline 
specification can b e used for this safety surveillance.   
Additionally, all patients are required to undergo examination of the anus by [CONTACT_825109]/her designee at baseline and at the end of treatment visit.  The most 
current exam ination may be utilized as the baseline exam ination for the extension 
(rollover) protocol if it was conducted during the screening period or conduct of the 
antecedent protocol.
Female patients must have a pelvic examination (including eva luation of the uterine 
cervix and Papanicola ou [Pap] smear) at baseline and at the end of treatment visit 
performed by [CONTACT_825110].  The most current exam ination may be utilized 
as the screening examination for the extension (rollover) protocol if it was conducted 
during the screening p eriod or the conduct of the antecedent protocol .

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Follow- Up
After the study completion visit, ongoing adverse events thought to be related to study 
treatment will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline grade, is assessed by 
[CONTACT_226876], new anti -tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to 
follow -up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that study treatment 
or participation is not the cause of the adverse events.
After the study completion visit, investigators should report only serious adverse events 
that are deemed related to study treatment.  
After the study completion/early termination visit, adverse events should be followed as 
outlined in Sections 5.5and 5.6.
See Appendix 1for the schedule of follow -up assessments.
4.5.[ADDRESS_1144115] the right to voluntarily 
discontinue study drug or withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  Reasons 
for discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from the study may include but are not 
limited to the following:
Patient withdrawal of consent at any time
Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study
Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient .
Patient non -compliance, specifically defined as patient ’srefusal to take the required 
doses of study drugs, unless for a reason, as defined below
In cases where the patient decides to prematurely discontinue study treatment (“refuses 
treatment”), he or s he should be asked if he or she can still be contact[CONTACT_141917].  The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical 
records and in the eCRF.  If the patient is lost to follow -up, the investigator should 
contact [CONTACT_825113] a responsible relative by [CONTACT_825114].  A complete final 
evaluation at the time of the patient’s withdrawal should be made with an explanation of 
why the patient is withdrawing from the study.
When applicable, patients should be informed of circumstances under which their 
participation may be terminated by [CONTACT_370696]’s consent.  The
investigator may withdraw patients from the study in the event of intercurrent illness,

Protocol GO28399, Version 5 45adverse events, treatment failure after a prescribed procedure, lack of compliance with 
the study and/or study procedures (e.g., dosing instructions, study visits), cure, or any 
reason where it is believed by [CONTACT_825115].  Any administrative or other reasons for withdrawal 
must be documented and explained to the patient.  Any patient who discontinues will be 
encouraged to return to the study center for a study completion visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation from Study  Drug
Patients may continue to receive treatment with vemurafenib until disease progression 
(as defined by [CONTACT_093], according local institutional standard of care), 
unacceptable toxicity, or any other discontinuation criterion is met, as follows, whichever 
occurs first.
Disease progression as assessed per institutional standards of care 
Progressive disease during the antecedent protocol.  If approval to treat beyond 
progression was already given in the antecedent protocol, the patient may roll 
over into the current protocol. 
Under special circumstances, when it is believed that the patient may clinically 
benefit from continued therapy with vemurafenib (e.g., in case of mixed 
progression or progression of single lesion or appearance of a new single 
lesion), enrollment into this protocol and dosing beyond progression may be 
considered if it is judged by [CONTACT_093], in consultation with the Sponsor, to 
be in the best interest of the patient.  All such cases will require approval of the 
Sponsor before continuing study drug treatment within this protocol.
Intolerance of vemurafenib
If treatment is suspended more than 28 days, the patient should be withdrawn from 
the study
Initiat ion of other cancer medication
Pregnancy
Patients who discontinue study drug prematurely will be asked to return to the clinic for 
an end of treatment visit (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix 1).  The primary reason for 
premature study drug discontinuation should be documented on the appropriate eCRF.  
Patients who discontinue study drug prematurely will not be replaced.
All patient s who discontinue vemurafenib treatment will be followed for safety 
surveillance per the investigator’s discretion. 
Note: New primary melanomas identified as part of the dermatologic risk management 
plan outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , which are completely excised and without need for 
additional therapy, do not require patient discontinuation from study treatment.
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd

5. ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY
5.1 SAFETY PLA N
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients pa rticipating in this trial; in 
particular, the use of inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of patients.
5.1.[ADDRESS_1144116] common laborator y abnormalities reported as adverse events included elevations 
of liver function tests (i.e., GGT, ALP , ALT, AST, and bilirubin).  The majority of adverse 
events reported in conjunction with Phase I to III clinical trials were of mild or moderate 
severity.  Approximately one -half of all patients treated with vemurafenib required 
interruption and/or reduction of dose on at least one occasion, although treatment 
discontinuation due to adverse events has been rare.
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 47Approximately 20% of vemurafenib rec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_825082], 
cutaneous SCCs (mainly KA type).   The majority of SCCs we re observed within the first 
16weeks of vemurafenib exposure and were not treatment limiting.  
Eight cases of skin lesions in 7 vemurafenib- treated patients were reported as new 
primary malignant melanomas in Study NO25026. No cases were reported in patients 
treated with dacarbazine. Cases were managed with excision, and patients continued 
treatment without dose adjustment. Surveillance measures to monitor for the 
occurrence of new primary melanomas, SCC (cutaneous and non -cutaneous), and any 
new primary malignancies are outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Two cases of SCC of the head and neck have been reported in 2 patients treated with 
vemurafenib in excess of 300 days while enrolled in a clinical trial.  Pathology 
exam ination of both tumors (one a primary tonsillar tumor, the other a primar y tongue 
tumor) revealed the presence of invasive SCC.  Of note, the first patient’s medical 
history was significant for risk factors for head and neck cancer and the tumor tissue 
tested positive for HPV.  The second patient does not appear to possess any risk factors 
for head and neck cancer, and the preliminary examination of the tumor tissue did not 
reveal the presence of HPV genome.  Full details are provided in the current 
Vemurafenib IB.
Five cases of adenomatous colonic polyps have been reported in p atients who received 
vemurafenib for more than 2 years, and 1 patient in the Expanded Access Program had 
one colonic adenoma discovered after treatment with vemurafenib for 0.57 years 
(Chapman et al. 2012 ).
Analysis of ECG data from the Phase II Study NP22657 of vemurafenib in previously 
treated patients with metastatic melanoma revealed a risk of QT interval prolongation 
without associated clinical symptomatology . 
See Section [IP_ADDRESS] and the Vemurafenib IB for more details.
5.1.2 General Plan to Manage Safety Concerns
[IP_ADDRESS] Eligibility Criteria
Eligibility criteria exclude patients who previously discontinued vemurafenib for any 
reason in an antecedent protocol or who met an exclusion criterion, as specified in the 
antecedent study or the extension (rollover) protoc ol.
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all adverse events and 
targeted laboratory assessm ents according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.  Patients will be 
monitored on Day [ADDRESS_1144117].
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version [ADDRESS_1144118] (see 
Section 5.4.2 ) will be reported in an expedited fashion.
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring and Management of Specific Toxicities and 
Conditions That May  Arise with Treatment with Vemurafenib 
Non- Squamous Cell Carcinoma Skin Toxicity
The non -SCC skin tox icities observed in patients treated with vemurafenib include rash, 
pruritus, palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia, dry skin, and exfoliation.  Of these, the most 
common has been rash (maculopapular or acneiform), which has generally been 
manageable with supportive care.  Skin toxicities other than lesions suspected of being 
cuSCC will be managed with supportive care according to institutional guidelines as well 
as by [CONTACT_267558]/modification, as specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Mild to severe photosensitivity has been reported in patients who received vemurafenib 
in clinical studies.  All patients should be advised to avoid sun exposure while taking the 
study drug.  Patients should be advised to wear protective clothing and use a broad 
spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen and lip balm ( sun protection factor 30) when outdoors 
to help protect against sunburn.  For photosensitivity Grade 2 (intolerable) adverse 
reactions, dose modifications will be required (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Management and Safety  Surveillance for Cutaneous Squamous Cell 
Carcinoma and New Primary  Melanoma
If a patient develops cuSCC during the study, this information must be collected and 
reported as a non -serious adverse event of special interest to the Sponsor, whether it is 
deemed related or unrelated to s tudy drug.  
If a patient develops a new primary melanoma during the study, this information must be 
collected and reported as a non -serious adverse event of special interest to the Sponsor, 
whether it is deemed related or unrelated to study drug.  An unscheduled dermatologic 
examination may be performed during treatment for investigation of any new suspi[INVESTIGATOR_825083].
Confirmed cuSCC and/or new primary melanoma should be completely resected and 
treated according local institutional standard of care.  Vemurafenib treatment interruption 
and/or dose modifications are not recommended (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for more details.
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 49Management and Safety  Surveillance for Non- Cutaneous Squamous Cell 
Carcinoma :
A thorough head and neck examination to monit or for non- cutaneous SCC, 
consisting of at least a visual inspection of the oral mucosa and lymph node 
palpation, must be performed by [CONTACT_825116].  The most current exam ination from the 
antecedent protocol may be utilized as the screening exam ination for the extension 
(rollover) protocol if it was conducted within [ADDRESS_1144119] dose of 
vemurafenib.  Subsequent head and neck examinations will be performed as 
outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Chest CT scans must be performed at baseline, within 30 days before the start of 
study treatment and then every 6 months (with a window of 21 days) after initiation 
of treatment until death, withdrawal of consent, orloss to follow -up, whichever 
occurs first.  Available routine chest CT scans from previous as sessments may be 
used, as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Additionally, all patients are required to undergo examination (visual and dig ital) of 
the anus and anal canal by [CONTACT_825117]/her designee at baseline 
and at the end of the study (end of treatment visit).  The most current exam ination
from the antecedent protocol may be used, as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Female patients must have a pelvic examination (including evaluation of the uterine 
cervix by [CONTACT_825118]) at baseline and at the end of the s tudy (end of treatment visit), 
performed by a gynecologist or designee.  The most current exam ination from the 
antecedent protocol may be used, as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
An unscheduled examination may be performed during treatment for the 
investigation of any new lesion or symptom suspected to be SCC (head and neck, 
anus, pelvic for female patients only, chest CT) .
New Primary  Invasive Malignancies
All new primary invasive malignancies will be reported until 28days after treatment 
completion, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up,or death, whichever occurs earliest.
If a patient develops a new primary invasive malignancy during or up to 28days after 
study treatment completion, this event must be reported to the Sponsor as a serious 
adverse event , whether it is deemed related or unrelated to study drug.  Thereafter, only 
new primary malignancies thought to be related to study treatment will be reported as 
serious adverse events .
Any identified lesion suspected to be a new primary malignancy (including cuSCC, 
non-cutaneous SCC ,and/or new primary melanoma) must be biops ied or excised and 
sent for pathological examination and should be treated according local institutional 
standard of care.  
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 50Hepatic Toxicity
Cases of l iver injury, including severe cases of liver injury, ha vebeen reported with 
vemurafenib use.   These hav e been generally managed with interruption of treatment 
and dose reduction.  All patients will undergo liver function testing at periodic intervals 
while on study treatment (see Appendix 1).  Guidelines for interruption or dose reduction 
of vemurafenib in the setting of liver function abnormality are provided in Section 5.1.[ADDRESS_1144120] hematologic parameters monitored throughout the study.   See the 
Vemurafenib IB for full details of potential hematologic adverse events reported in 
association with vemurafenib treatment.
Gastrointestinal Toxicity
Gastrointestinal toxicities will be managed according to institutional guidelines/standard 
of care.  During the study, patients are to receive maximal supportive care as clinically 
indicated.  Any modification of study treatment for diarrhea must strictly follow the 
instructions in Table 1 .
Pancreatic Toxicity
The Sponsor recommends that workup of any suspected case of pancreatitis should 
include serum amylase and lipase testing ,in addition to other appropriate testing 
(e.g.,CT abdomen).
Ocular Toxicity
See the Vemurafenib IB for further details on the occurrence of anterior uveitis and a 
single case of retinal vein occlusion reported in association with vemurafenib treatment.
Examination of the eyes (inspection of conjunctivae and pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324]) ispart of the physical 
examinatio n.  
Cardiac Toxicity
Patients with a baseline QTc 450ms or a history of congenital long QT syndrome 
should not receive treatment with vemurafenib.   Refer to the Vemurafenib IB for 
additional details.
The following recommendations have been developed to minimize the risk of cardiac 
toxicity in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with vemurafenib in this study:
Avoid combination with other medications with known potential to lead to 
prolongation of the QTc interval, if possible (see Appendix 4)
ECG monitoring will occur at baseline and at specified intervals, as outlined in the 
Schedule of Assessments (see Appendix 1).
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 51If the QTc increases to 500 ms ,orif a change from baseline of 60 ms is 
observed during the study, vemurafenib treatment should be temporarily i nterru pted.  
Electrolytes (K, Mg, albumin, and Ca) should be monitored ,and any electrolyte 
abnormalities, especially hypokalemia, should be corrected prior to re -institution of 
therapy.  ECG should be monitored weekly until the QTc normalizes before therapy 
is reinstituted at a reduced dose.  Dose reduction should occur as described in 
Table 1 .  A second sustained occurrence of QTc interval prolongation to 500ms,
despi[INVESTIGATOR_16574], will require discontinuation of vemurafenib.
Vemurafenib treatment should be permanently discontinued if theQTc increases to
500ms and changes from baseline exceed 60 ms.
5.1.3 Dose Interruption/Modification for A dverse Events
If a d ose is missed, it can be taken 4 or more hours before the next dose to maintain the 
twice -daily regimen.  Both doses should not be taken at the same time.
Management of symptomatic adverse drug reacti ons (e.g., arthralgia, fatigue, rash) may 
require either temporary interruption or dose reduction of vemurafenib treatment or both.  
When dose reduction is needed, dose reduction in 240 -mg BID increments is 
recommended depending onindividual safety and tolerability.  Dose escalation after 
dose reduction is generally not recommended unless under special circumstances 
(i.e., increased likelihood of clinical benefit for the dose increase and no safety concerns).  
This should be done after discussion with the Sponsor.  Dose increases above [ADDRESS_1144121] appearance of intolerable Grade 2 or Grade 3 toxicity, despi[INVESTIGATOR_478768], it is recommended that patients discontinue vemurafenib. 
For Grade 4 toxicities, pa tients should discontinue study treatment or, onthe basis of 
investigator judgment, study treatment should be interrupted until resolution to Grade 1
or lower with dose reduction of 50% upon restarting study drug.  It is recommended that 
patients permanently discontinue vemurafenib for a second occurrence of any Grade 4 
toxicities.
If treatmen t interruption has occurred for [ADDRESS_1144122] permanently discontinued study treatment.  Exceptions may be

Congenital anomaly or birth defect in a neonate or inf ant born to a mother exposed 
to the study drug
Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above)
A new primary invasive malignancy (other than cuSCC or new primary melanoma) or 
progression or recurrence of a prior invasive malignancy (other than the disease under 
study) will be characterized as a serious adverse event .

Protocol GO28399, Version 5 54The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Se verity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_267565] 24 hours after learning of the event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).
5.2.[ADDRESS_1144127] (Immediately  Reportable to 
[COMPANY_002])
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_141926] 24 hours after learning of the event (see Section 5.4.2for reporting 
instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following:
 Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST 
in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
[CONTACT_25742]'s Law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257] , as defined below
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected.
Grade 3 or 4 QTc interval prolongation
cuSCC
New primary melanoma
5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F ORCAPTURING A ND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adv erse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.45.6.
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).
Adverse events still ongoing or not resolved at the time of enrol lment in the extension 
(rollover) study should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF ,as specified in the 
protocol, with the original onset date from the antecedent study.
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version [ADDRESS_1144128].  All 
adverse event s, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743], will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only 
serious adverse event s caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported 
(e.g., serious adverse event s related to invasive procedures such as biopsies).
After initiation of study drug, all adverse event s, regardless of relationship to study drug, 
will be reported until [ADDRESS_1144129].  
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting 
period are provided in Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoint s.  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following:
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?”
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?” 
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of A dverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE v4.0 will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity. Table 2 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifica lly listed in the NCI CTCAE.

5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or 
not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating " yes" or 
"no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration:
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study d rug, or reintroduction of study drug (where applicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event

Protocol GO28399, Version [ADDRESS_1144131] medical terminology and concepts when recording 
adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Colloquialisms and abbreviations should 
be avoided.
Only one a dverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
For adverse event s, a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or 
hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a 
constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single 
diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously 
reported adverse event sbased on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced 
by [CONTACT_25746], with a starting date that 
corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurr ing Secondary  to Other Events
In general, adverse event soccurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  However, medica lly significant adverse event s
occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded 
as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported s eparately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and subsequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by a mild, non -serious infection, only neutropenia 
should be reported on the eCRF.
If neu tropenia is accompanied by a severe or serious infection, both events should 
be reported separately on the eCRF.
All adverse event sshould be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 [IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
by[CONTACT_25748] "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that the 
event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifi es as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
should be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review a ll laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event .
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndr ome 
(e.g., ALP and bilir ubin 5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] associated with 
cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholecystitis) should be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated 
potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormality can be 
characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should 
be recorded as the adverse event .  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 
7.0mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.”
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 59Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The init ial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or 
seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event .  A vital sign result should 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a c hange in concomitant therapy
Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood press ure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or 
seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  
Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event of special interest the 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin
2ULN
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]
) 
and reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1144132] (see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 [IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 5.3.1 ) that are attribute d by [CONTACT_825119]/Early 
Discontinuation eCRF.  All other on -study deaths, regardless of relationship to study 
drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the 
Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  Th e event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should 
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].  The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
If the death is attributed to progression of the underlying malignancy , this should not be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF but should be captured i n the Death and Disease 
Progression/Final Treatment Visit eCRFs .  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section 5.6.
The study will comply with all local regulatory requirements and adhere to the full 
requirements of the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 (see Appendix 5).
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the baseline/screening visit f or 
this study.  Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and 
Baseline Conditions eCRF (see Appendix 1).
A preex isting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the 
concept that the p reexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., more frequent headaches”).
[IP_ADDRESS] Worsening of Malignancy
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse event s.  In most cases, the 
expected pattern of progression will be based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) criteria.  In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will 
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 61be based on symptomatic deterioration.  Howev er, every effort should be made to 
document progression with use of objective criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to 
whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse 
event .
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825084] a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious 
adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined below.  
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26664] a serious adverse event:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825085]
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33403].
The patient has not suffered an adverse event .
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825086] t o be a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_184016] a result of a patient’s 
preexisting condition(s) that have not worsened s ince receiving trial medication.  
Examples may include but are not limited to cholecystectomy for gallstones, joint 
replacement surgery, and diagnostic testing.  Such events should still be recorded 
as medical procedures in the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdoses
Study drug overdose is the accidental or intentional u se of the drug in an amount higher 
than the dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study drug is not 
an adverse event unless it results in untoward medical effects.  
Any study drug overdose or incorrect administration of study dru g should be noted on 
the Study Drug Administration eCRF. 
All adverse event sassociated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug 
should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills 
serious criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours after 
learning of the event (see Section 5.4.2 ).
Vemurafenib —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version [ADDRESS_1144133] report the following events to the Sponsor within 24 hours after 
learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug:
Serious adverse events
Non-serious adverse events of special interest
Pregnancies
The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours after becoming aware of the information.  New significant 
information includes the following:
New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis
Significant new diagnostic test results
Change in causality on the basis of new information
Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery
Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
event s to the local health authority and Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics 
Committee (EC).

EDC system is available, all informat ion will need to be entered and submitted via the 
EDC system.  
5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Patients
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_1144136] 
doses of study drug.  A Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed by [CONTACT_23514] 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy and submitted via the EDC 
system.  A pregnancy report will automatica lly be generated and sent to [COMPANY_002] Safety 
Risk Management.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
The investigator should discontinue vemurafenib and counsel the patient, discussing the 
risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient 
should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, a Pregnancy Report worksheet and 
Pregnancy Fax Coversheet should be completed and faxed to [COMPANY_002] Safety Risk 
Manag ement or its designee within 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy with use of
the fax numbers provided to investigators (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact 
[CONTACT_7171] & List of Investigators").
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
6months after the last dose of vemurafenib.  A Pregnancy Report eCRF should be 
completed by [CONTACT_19452] [ADDRESS_1144137] and report details of 
the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to 
study drug.  When permitted by [CONTACT_779], pregnant partner would need to sign an
Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for 
follow -up on her pregnancy.  If the authorization has been signed, the investigator 
should update the Pregnancy Report eCRF with additional information on the course 
and outcome of the pregnancy.  An investigator who is contact[CONTACT_825120] e fetus, to support an informed decision in cooperation with the

Section [IP_ADDRESS] should be followed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abortions
Any spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (because the 
Sponsor considers spontaneous abortions to be medically significant events), recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event (see Section 5.4.2 ).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Congenital A nomalies or Birth Defects
Any congenital anomaly or birth defect in a child born to a female patient (or female 
partner of a male patient exposed to vemurafenib) should be classified as a serious 
adverse event , recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours after learning of the event (see Section 5.4.2 ).
5.[ADDRESS_1144138] to follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to 
follow all serious adverse event s considered to be related to study drug or trial -related 
procedures until a final outcome can be reported.
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data 
verification.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.  
5.5.[ADDRESS_1144139] , and 
pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, 
and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information 
(e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to 
perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case.
5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE ADVERSE 
EVENT REPORTING PERIOD
The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse 
event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 28days 
[see Section 5.3.1] after the final dose of study drug), if the event is believed to be 
related to prior study drug treatment.  These events should be reported through use of 
the Adverse Event eCRF.  However, if the EDC system is not available, the investigator 
should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by [CONTACT_825121] —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd

5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEA LTH AUTHORITIE S, 
INVESTIGA TORS, INSTI TUTIONA L REVIEW BOA RDS, A ND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference document(s) :
Vemurafenib IB
Local prescribing information for Zelboraf(vemurafenib)
Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) Core Data Sheet
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event an d the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance f or upgrading by [CONTACT_25753].
6. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLAN
There is no formal hypothesis testing in this extension ( rollover) study.  Data will be 
collected and reported descriptively for all study endpoints.

7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical 
protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_825122], complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include but are not limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85961], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data fro m automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_825087] —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol GO28399, Version 5 67and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, 
patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5.
To facilitate source data verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for t rial-related 
monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The investigational site must also allow 
inspection by [CONTACT_25756].
7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s 
computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the

Is fatal (results in death) (Note:  Death is an outcome, not an event.)
Is life threatening (Note :  The term "life threatening" refers to an event in which the 
patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event thatcould hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe.)
Required in -patient hospit alization or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the 
outcomes listed above
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whet her expedited 
reporting to the S ponsor is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical 
events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825091].  These situations should also usually be 
considered serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias ,or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_456004].
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not 
consist ent with the applicable product information.
The investigator initially assesses causality.  For serious adverse events, selecting one 
or more options indicates possible causes of the event.  (Check all that apply .) 
Preexisting/underlying disease specify 
Study treatment specify the drug(s) related to the event
Other treatment (concomitant or previous) specify
Protocol -related procedure
Other (e.g., accident, new or intercurrent illness) specify
The term severe is a measure of intensity ;thus, a severe adverse event is not 
necessarily serious.  For example, nausea of several hours of duration may be rated as 
severe but may not be clinically serious.

Date of Approval: 08/10/[ADDRESS_63586]-operative nausea and vomiting, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], immunosuppression, constipation, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_58320]. In the [LOCATION_002], over $600 billion is spent every year on opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827], including $[ADDRESS_63587] been 
experiencing an increase in death related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211]. 
Evidence supports the concept that the human body is “electric.” This property is 
routinely used to monitor organ function such as the hear t, the brain , and more. In the case of 
local trauma and pain, it is established that pain is the result of local inflammation, a local decrease in pH and therefore an accumulation of negative ch arges. In this respect the  nCAP 
Nano patch  is a patch charged negatively. Therefore, when applied at the site of the pain, the

Specific Aims  
1. The p rimary endpoint will be to prospectively investigate the efficacy of the nCAP Signal 
Relief Patch  in reducing perioperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_58321] (up to [ADDRESS_63589]-op) in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-naïve patients undergoing primary unilateral total hip or knee replacement 
surgery. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_58322]. 
2. The s econdary endpoint will include the effects of nCAP Signal Relief Patch after the 
placement on postoperative pain, functional recovery, time to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and opi[INVESTIGATOR_58323], such as , PONV, itching, sleep disorders, respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826], and urinary retention.  
Study Design  
The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_58324] a single-center prospective, randomized, 
open label trial at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_45589] (UPMC) Shadyside Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Institutional review board approval will be obtained before eligible patients are recruited and consented. T he trial will be registered at www.clinicaltrial.gov before beginning recruitment.  
The efficacy of this device will be established  by [CONTACT_58332][INVESTIGATOR_58325] ≤ 4 using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Accordingly, pain will be treated according to the following protocol: pain scores ≤ 4, non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], pain scores between 4 and 6 oxycodone 5 mg q 4 hrs and ≥  7, oxycodone 10 mg, 
Hydromorphone IV 0.2-0.5 mg q 3 hr. Data collected following the placement in the treatment group (Standard of Care ERAS protocol + nCAP Signal Relief Patch) will be compared  to the 
data obtained in the control group (Standard of Care ERAS protocol).

 Recruitment  
Potential subjects may be given a recruitment flyer (attached) in the office of surgeons Drs. 
O'Malley, Plate, or Klatt. The potential subjects who receive a flyer will then have the option of contact[CONTACT_58333], or, if they express interest in participating in the surgeon's office, their name [CONTACT_58340]'s office staff.  Potential subjects may also be identified by [CONTACT_58334]. If a subject is deemed eligible via inclusion/exclusion criteria, a study team member will approach them the morning of their scheduled surgery and discuss the study with them at length and answer any questions they may have. If a potential subject is willing to sign consent, then a physician investigator will be available to review the consent, risks and benefits of participation, and obtain informed consent.  If our research team is contact[CONTACT_58335], or if we reach out based upon the list of interested potential subjects, study team will discuss the study at length over the phone and answer any questions the potential subjects may have. Subjects interested in participating will be emailed the curren tly approved informed consent form to review. They will be given the option 
to sign consent electronically for convenience via REDCap or they can sign consent form on the day of surgery in the pre-operative holding area.  The subject will be approached as soon as they arrive to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (at least 2-3 hours before their surgery) and will be given adequate time to consider the consent and ask questions. The patient will be urged to take as long as necessary to decide whether or not to participate. If the

[ADDRESS_63590] enough time to make a decision, they will not be enrolled in the 
trial.  
 
All questions will be addressed and it will be made clear that the patient may withdraw 
from the study at any time. Investigator physician will sign the informed consent with the patient prior to beginning of any study procedures. Randomization Process  
Participating patie nts will be randomized by [CONTACT_22123]- generated rando m numbers to 
either the control group (standard of care ERAS protocol) or intervention group (nCAP Signal Relief Patch group+ ERAS protocol). Inclusion Criteria:  
• Over 18 years of age  
• Scheduled for elective p rimary unilateral hip or knee replacement surgery  
Exclusion Criteria:  
• Active clinical depression, anxiety, or catastrophizing 
• Raw s core equal  to or greater t han 19 on the PROMIS Anxiety 8a - Adult v1.0 
• Active alcoholism or drug abuse  
• Severe chronic pain condition that requires daily preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561] 
• Total surgery revision, bilateral hip replacement, multiple surgeries 
Treatment Groups  
Each subject will undergo surgery and anesthesia using the approved ERAS protocol. 
Control Arm  (n=30) : Control group will receive approved ERAS multimodal anesthesia 
protocol (standard of care) .

 Interventional Arm  (n=30):  Intervention group will receive approved ERAS 
multimodal anesthesia protocol plus an nCAP Signal Relief Patch . 
Data Collection and Outcome Measures  
After signing an informed consent, subjects will complete the PROMIS Emotional 
Distress – Anxiety – Short Form 8a before completing any other questionnaires. Subjects who 
have a raw score <[ADDRESS_63591] who scores ≥ [ADDRESS_63592] is enrolled, they will be asked to complete the Pain Catastrophizing 
Scale (PCS), the PROMIS® Emotional Distress -Depression - Short Form 8a, and the PROMIS® 
Item Bank v1.0 – Sleep - Disturbance – Short Form 8a prior to surgery. The subject will also 
conduct a baseline functionality test to assess mobility and strength in their leg. The functional recovery will be assessed by [CONTACT_58336] 100 feet, go up 5 steps and raise their leg on the day of surgery. Scores can be 0 (no ability to raise the leg), 1 (some ability to raise the leg), and 2 (complete ability to raise the leg).  
Once these assessments are completed, subjects will be equally randomized to the 
intervention group (nCAP signal relief Patch + standard of care) or control group (standard of care). Both  the control group and intervention group will receive approved ERAS multimodal 
standard of care. Only the interventional group will receive an nCAP Signal Relief Patch. Randomization will occur by [CONTACT_58337] a subject ID number, and this ID number will correspond to a treatment allocation based on a pre-designed randomization schema. 
Subjects will undergo surgery using the approved ERAS anesthetic and post- operative 
pain management protocols.

[ADDRESS_63593] Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Subjects will be made aware at the time of consent and throughout the trial that they can drop out of the study at any time if they do not like wearing the nCAP Signal Relief Patch. The control group will not receive a patch but will receive the standard of care ERAS protocol.  Subjects in the intervention group will be instructed to keep the nCAP Signal Relief Patch on their surgical dressing to avoid the risk for skin irritation. 
Pain using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at rest and with movement as well as opi[INVESTIGATOR_58326].  
Subjects as signed to the intervention group should keep the nCAP Signal Relief Patch in 
place for [ADDRESS_63594] pain -related outcomes. They will be contact[CONTACT_24211] (REDCAP survey) on post-
operative day 1,2,3, 7, 14, and [ADDRESS_63595] and with movement, pain catastrophizing (via Pain Catastrophizing Scale) sleep quality (via PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Short Form 8a) and to assess functional recovery. Functional recovery will be assessed by [CONTACT_58336] 100 feet, go up 5 steps and raise their leg on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 30 as well as the pain associated with it. Patient satisfaction with pain management after surgery will be assessed at the 30 day follow up (0- least satisfied to [ADDRESS_63596] satisfied).  Subjects who 
are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] v ia REDCap to complete follow -up questionnaires and do not complete them on 
the day they are assigned will be contact[CONTACT_58338] a reminder. They will be considered lost to follow up after [ADDRESS_63597], including: patient demographics, 
medical history, medication summary while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], as well as progress notes from the 
entire encounter to determine the existence of adverse events.  
Pre-and-Post Metric Evaluation  
The use of a non-phar macological nCAP Signal Relief Patch  has the possibility of 
providing analgesia to post-surgical patients and reducing the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_58327]. This will significantly impact patient outcomes, as patients will experience fewer opio id-related side effects (such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], post-operative nausea and 
vomiting, constipation, and delirium). This will also impact clinicians caring for post- operative 
patients, as there is the real potential they will have fewer conditions to  monitor and treat as the 
patient recovers from surgery. The projected number of patients served by [CONTACT_58339] [ADDRESS_63598] 
from opi[INVESTIGATOR_58328]. Data collected from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_58329] a future proposal to the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to fund a full-scale, randomized, placebo -controlled trial using the nCAP Signal Relief Patch.  
Perhaps most importantly, the investigative use of the non-invasive nCAP Signal Relief 
patch  has the ability to significantly decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_58321], postoperative pain, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7491], the needs for opi[INVESTIGATOR_58330], improve early functional recovery , and increase patient satisfaction . 
Being able to offer the orthopedic patients at UPMC Shadyside Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58331] a non-pharmacological approach to pain management and an alternative to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], increase patient satisfaction, an d improve early functional recovery.

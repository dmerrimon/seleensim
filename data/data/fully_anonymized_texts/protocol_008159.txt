VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  Study Schedule/Pro cedures:    
Subjects will have regularly scheduled study visits at the clinical site on Day 1 of each cycle.  
Additional study visits may be required during some cycles to monitor for safety, efficacy
.  Study visits are as follows:  
Screening:   Up to [ADDRESS_1012994] is enrolled in the study (Cycle 1 
Day 1). 
Cycle 1 and Cycle 6:  Day 1 and Day 8 (± 1 day).  
All other treatment cycles:   Day 1 (± 3 days).  
Efficacy assessments:  Every 8 weeks (± 7 days).  After 12 months, efficacy assessments will occur 
every 12 weeks (± 7 days) until disease progression is determined.  
End of treat ment:   ± 3 days of withdrawal from study.  
Safety follow -up:  30 days (+ 7 days) and 60 days (+ 7 days) after the last dose of study treatment.  
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, these safety follow -up visits will include AE and concomitant 
medication asse ssment only and may be completed remotely (such as by [CONTACT_741034]).  
Disease follow -up:  Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression will 
continue to be assessed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) for their disease status during the fo llow-up period 
and should continue to have tumor assessments until a new cancer therapy is started, disease 
progression, death, the end of the study, or the subject withdraws consent.  
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, no further disease follow -up assessme nts will be required beyond 
the last safety follow -up visit . 
Survival follow -up:  Once a subject has confirmed disease progression or starts a new anticancer 
therapy, the subject moves into the survival follow -up period and should be contact[CONTACT_457] [ADDRESS_1012995]'s caregiver.  
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, no further survival follow -up assessments will be requi red 
beyond the last safety follow -up visit . 
Estimated Duration of Participation:   Subjects may continue on treatment as long as they are 
receiving benefit and do not meet withdrawal criteria , or for up to [ADDRESS_1012996].  
Estimated Number of Subjects:  
• Phase 1 Dose Escalatio n – Approximately 90 to 270  evaluable subjects.  
Note:   The minimum number of subjects assumes that the starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg; however, fewer  
subjects would be enrolled if a higher starting dose is used based on available safety data from the 
monothera py study INCAGN 1876 -101. 
Note:   The maximum number of subjects assumes that DLTs are observed in all dose cohorts to a 
maximum of 9 subjects per cohort across all treatment grou ps. 
• Phase 2 Stage 1  – Approximately 264 evaluable subjects . 
•  
• Phase 2 Stage 2  – Approximately 455 evaluable subjects . 
• Phase 2 Expansion Stage (PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort only) – Approximately 20 evaluable 
subjects  
Note:   Assumes that all treatment groups and all tumor types pro ceed to Stage 2 and expansion s tage 
(for PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort only).

In Phase 2, a Simon 2 -stage design will be run for the cervical cance r, gastric cancer, SCCHN and 
PD-1/PD -L1 relapsed melanoma cohorts within  a given doublet or triplet treatment group .  The 
planned Simon 2 -stage designs are summarized in Table  S5, assuming a 1 -sided Type I error of 0.05 
and power of 85% .  Each Simon [ADDRESS_1012997] a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_450714] 
a particular tum or type withi n the given drug combination at the end of Stage 1 if there is insufficient 
response observed (calculated response rate < p0), while enrolling enough subjects to predict possible 
target responses (≥ p1) worthy of cohort expansion and potentially further  evaluation in future studies.

p0:  Insufficient response rate.  
p1:  Target response rate.  
For the PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort in doublet Treatment Group F, a Simon 2 -stage design with an 
expansion stage, summarized in Table  S6, will be used.  With this 3 -stage design,  the 1 -sided Type I 
error is 0.0231 , and the power is approximately 88%.  The PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort will be 
terminated early for futility at the end of Stage 1 or Stage 2 if there is insufficient response observed.  
At the end of the expansion stage , if there is sufficient response observed , the doublet schedule for the 
PD-1 refractory SCCHN cohort will be declared promising for further investigation; otherwise it is 
considered nonpromising.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  Integrated Futility Analysis:  
For the cervical cancer, gastric cancer and SCCHN cohorts, when  each subject enrolls in Phase  2, an 
integrated analysis of tumor and dosing  strategies  (including concurrent dosing and INCAGN01876 
run-in Q2W  for 2 doses followed by [CONTACT_741036]01876 Q2W  in combination with the combining drug [s]) 
will be conducted based on Simon et al ( 2016 ).  Tumor types within a dosing strategy  will jointly be 
analyzed using a Bayesian model before allowing sharing of information across tumor types.  Similar 
sharing wil l be applied separately for dosing strategies  across tumor types.  The purpose of the 
integrated Bayesian analysis is to determine if INCAGN01876 is active within any of the given dosing  
strategies, given tumor types, or given dosing  strategy -tumor type co mbinations.  Enrollment in a 
dosing strategy -tumor type  combination will be terminated if the probability of success is not above  
20% for both analysis approaches.  Collection of response data will be based on investigator 
assessments entered into an interactive response technology  system and analyzed separately from the 
clinical database.  Additional information regarding the futility analysis is detailed in the full P rotocol.  
The proposed designs for each tumor type and treatment combination will be used for any planned 
Simon 2 -stage design in the treatment combination (including concurrent and sequential dosing).  Each 
Simon [ADDRESS_1012998] a 1 -sided Type I error of 0.05 and power of 85%.  The response 
rates for each tumor type within a d rug combination will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals.   
Formal safety reviews, to be held at least every 6 months, will be conducted to review efficacy  and 
safety  data.

4.1.1.  Phase 1 – Dose Escalation  
A minimum of 3 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in each treatment group beginning with 
INCAGN01876 Dose Cohort 1 (0.1 mg/kg; starting dose).  A higher starting dose of 
INCAGN01876 may be used if safety data are available from the monotherapy study 
(INCAGN  1876 -101) but will not exceed [ADDRESS_1013021] 3 evaluable subjects enrolled within an INCAGN01876 dose cohort will be observed 
for the specified DLT observation period before th e next dose cohort begins enrollment.  If 
0 DLTs occur in a cohort of 3 evaluable subjects, a new cohort of 3 evaluable subjects will be 
treated at the next higher dose level.  If 1 of 3 evaluable subjects experience a DLT, that cohort 
will be expanded to 6 evaluable subjects.  If 1 of 6 evaluable subjects experiences a DLT, a new 
cohort of 3 evaluable subjects will be treated at the next higher dose level.  If 2 of 6 evaluable 
subjects experience a DLT, that cohort will be expanded to 9  evaluable subjects.   If ≥ [ADDRESS_1013022] exceeded the MTD, and the previous dose level will be considered the MTD.  
If only 3  evaluable subjects were treated at the  MTD or PAD, then a minimum of 3 additional 
evaluable subjects will be enrolled before this dose is administered in Phase 2 of the study.

In all cases , investigators may  employ any measures or concomitant medications, after 
discussion with the medical monitor (whenever possible),  necessary to op timally treat the 
subject.  
5.4.4.  Follow -Up of Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Any DLT should be followed until it resolves to baseline or appears to have stabilized for a 
minimum of 4 weeks  (eg, 28 days) .  During follow -up, subjects should be seen as often as 
medica lly indicated to assure safety.  
5.4.5.  Procedures for Cohort Review and Dose Escalation  
Telephone conferences will be scheduled by [CONTACT_741043] -specific data and overall safety data, to agree on dose escalation, adju dicate 
individual high -grade AEs as potentially dose -limiting, and guide other major study decisions.  
5.4.6.  Criteria and Procedures for Dose Interruptions of Study Drug  
Treatment with INCAGN01876 in combination with standard immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_741006]  4 weeks (28 days) to allow for resolution of toxicity.  If an interruption  or 
discontinuation  is necessary, all study treatments should be interrupted  or discontinued .  
Subjects may resume treatment if no medical condition or other circumstance exists tha t, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would make the subject unsuitable for further participation in the 
study.  The treating investigator should contact [CONTACT_741044]  4 weeks (28 days) before restarting 
treatment.  
Instructions for INCAGN01876 dose interruptions are outlined in Table  7.  Individual decisions 
regarding dose interruptions  of study drug should be made using clinical judgment and in 
consultation with the medical monitor  (whenever possible) , taking into account relatedness of the 
AE to the study drug and the subject 's underlyin g condition.  Adverse events that have a clear 
alternative explanation , or transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated 
clinically significant signs or symptoms , may be exempt from dose -interruption  rules.   
Dose interruptions are permitted in the case of medical/surgical events or logistical reasons not 
related to study therapy (eg, elective surgery, unrelated medical events, subject vacation, and/or 
holidays).  Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 4 weeks (28 day s) of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the medical monitor.  The reason for 
interruption should be documented in the subject's study record.

INCAGN01876, nivolumab, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_741008], and it is 
possible that irAEs (both nonserious and serious) may occur.  Adverse events of a potential 
immunologic etiology or irAEs may be defined as an AE consistent with an immune 
phenomenon associated with drug exposure after all other etiologies have been eliminated .  
Immune -related AEs may be expected based on the nature of the study treatment , their 
mechanism of action, and reported exp erience with these and  other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Special 
attention should be paid to AEs that may be suggestive of potential irAEs.  An irAE can occur 
shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment.   Suspected irAEs 
should be discussed with the medical monitor when possible.  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of drug-related 
AEs with potential immunologic etiology are outlined in  Table  8.  Detailed supportive care 
guidelines for specific irAEs can be in found in Appendix  B.  Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_741009]; 
the treatin g investigator may use labeled guidance or institutional guidelines for the management 
of irAEs if preferred.  For each AE, attempts should be made to  rule out other causes, including 
but not limited to metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, w hich might require specific 
supportive care.

The occurrence of unacceptable toxicity not caused by [CONTACT_741047].  Unacceptable toxicity is defined as  follows : 
• Grade 4 or life -threatening AEs, except with approval from the medical monitor.  
• ≥ Grade 2 ocular irAE.  
• Occurrence of an AE that is related to treatment , in the judgment of the investigator 
or the medical monitor, and compromises the subject 's ability to continue 
study -specific pr ocedures  or is considered to not be in the subject 's best interest.  
• Persistent AE requiring a delay of treatment  for more than 4 weeks (28 days)  unless a 
greater delay has been approved by [CONTACT_456].  
5.5. Withdrawal of Subjects  From Study Treatment  
5.5.1.  Withdrawal Criteria  
A subject may choose to withd raw from the study treatment at any time or be withdrawn from 
the study treatment by [CONTACT_4687], if the subject is noncompliant with the study 
requirements.  If permanent discontinuation of any of the study treatments is necessary  
(eg, INCAGN01876, nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), all study treatments, will be discontinued.  If a 
subject is withdrawn  from study treatment , then every reasonable effort should be made to 
determine the reason for withdrawal, and this information should be recorded in th e eCRF.  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from study treatment  for the following reasons:  
• The subject becomes pregnant.  
• Consent is withdrawn.   Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any time 
without penalty of jeopardizing their health care or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled.  
Note:   Consent withdrawn means that the subject can no longer be followed and no 
additional data can be collected.  Subjects may choose to discontinue study treatment 
and remain in the study to be follow ed for progression and survival.   
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who wi thdraw consent will no longer 
be followed for progression and survival  beyond the last safety follow -up visit .  
• Further participation would be injurious to the subject 's health or well -being , in the 
investigator's medical judgment.  
• Unacceptable toxicity (see Section  5.4.9 ).  Subjects with unacceptable toxicities must  
be withdrawn from study treatment but will continue in the follow -up phase of the 
study (see Section  6.4). 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_456].  
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_19407], IRB, or IEC.  
Incyte Biosciences  International S àrl Page  [ADDRESS_1013042]  may be discontinued  from study treatment  as follows : 
• Confirmed radiographic progression of disease per RECIST v1.1 (see Section  7.7.1 ).  
A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment with confirmed 
radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved (see Section  7.7.1 ). 
Note :  For unconfirmed progression see Section  7.7.1 . 
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility criteria 
(see Section  3), the medical monitor, in collaboration w ith the investigator, will 
determine whether the subject should be withdrawn from the study.  
• If a subject is lost -to-follow -up or noncompliant with study procedures or study 
treatment in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the sponsor should be consulted for instr uction 
on handling the subject.  
5.5.2.  Withdrawal Procedures  
In the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study treatment , the subject 
will be withdrawn , and the EOT visit should be conducted.   Reasonable efforts should be made 
to have th e subject return for a ll applicable f ollow -up visit s (safety and efficacy; see Section  6.4).  
The last date of the last dose of study treatment  and the reason for subject withdrawal will be 
recorded  in the eCRF . 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study  treatment : 
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified.  
• The reason(s)  for withdrawal from treatment must be documented in the subject's 
medical record and in the eCRF.   
Note:   The reason for withdrawal from treatment may be different than the reason for 
withdrawal from study.  For example, subjects can discontinue treatmen t for disease 
progression or toxicity, but remain in the study  for safety and survival follow -up.   
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who discontinue treatment will no 
longer be followed for progression and s urvival  beyond the last safety follow -up visit . 
• The EOT visit should be performed.  
• The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the eCRF and IRT. 
• Subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up visit or until 
study treatment –related toxicities resolve, return to baselin e, or are deemed 
irreversible, or until the subject begins new anticancer therapy, whichever is longest.  
• Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression will continue to 
be followed for disease status as outlined in Section  6.4.2 . 
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who discontinue for reasons other than 
disease progression will no longer be followed for disease status beyon d the last 
safety follow -up visit .

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  • All subjects who discontinue study treatment will continue to be followed for OS as 
outlined in Section  6.4.3 . 
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who discontinue study treatment will 
no longer be followed for survival beyond the last safety follow -up visit . 
If the subject discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of 
follow -up data (safety follow -up, disease assessment s, or survival follow -up), then no additional 
data collection should occur; however, subjects will have the optio n of withdrawing consent 
for study treatment but continuing in the follow -up period of the study for safety, efficacy, 
and survival assessments . 
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who withdraw consent but continue in the 
follow -up period will be f ollowed for efficacy and survival until  the last safety follow -up visit . 
5.6. Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the eCRF.  Any prior 
medication received up to [ADDRESS_1013043],  will be recorded in the eCRF.  Any addition, deletion, or change in the dose of these 
medications will also be recorded.  Conc omitant treatments/procedures that are required to 
manage a subject 's medical condition during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF.  
5.6.1.  Permitted Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject 's welfare may be 
admini stered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983].  All concomitant medications will be recorded on the eCRF, including all 
prescription, over -the-counter, herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids .  If changes 
occur during the study period, documentation of drug regimen, frequency, route, and date may 
also be included on the eCRF.  Note :  The use of bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted 
in this study.  
5.6.2.  Restricted Medications  
Systemic glucocort icoids for any purpose other than prophylaxis for contrast allergies for 
radiographic procedures, or to modulate symptoms or treat an AE of suspected immunologic 
etiology, are restricted and require medical monitor approval.  The use of physiologic 
cortico steroid replacement therapy may be approved after consultation with the medical monitor.  
Note:   Inhaled and topi[INVESTIGATOR_14271].  A short course of steroids (prednisone or 
equivalent) ≤ 10 mg/day may be permitted with medical monitor approval.  
5.6.3.  Prohibited Medications  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criter ia (see Section  3.2) are 
not allowed during the study.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohibited during the study, discontinuation from study treatment  may 
be required.  The investigator should discuss any questio ns regarding this with the medical 
monitor .  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator

treatment  requires the mutu al agreement of the investigator, the sponsor, and the subject.  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_450718] , unless otherwise indicated : 
• Any anticancer medications, including chemo therapy or biologic therapy other than study 
treatment.  
• Any immunological -based treatment for any reason from screening through the safety 
follow -up visit is prohibited.  
Note:   Completed adjuvant therapy (eg, vaccines) with medical monitor approval, inhale d 
or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], systemic steroids at doses ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalents, and 
immune suppressants are allowed for treatment for immune toxicities as described in 
Section  5.4.[ADDRESS_1013044] allergy for imaging 
procedures . 
Note:   Allergy sh ots may be permitted after consultation with the medical monitor.  
• Investigational agents other than study treatment.  Use of such medications from 
screening through the safety follow -up visit is prohibited.  
• Concomitant radiation therapy.  
Note:   Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
considered on an exceptional case -by-case basis after consultation with the medical 
monitor.  The subject must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field.  
Administration of pall iative radiation therapy will be considered clinical progression for 
the purposes of determining PFS.  
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_1013045] dose of study treatment  and while 
participating in the study.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus 
Calmette –Guérin, and typhoid (oral) vaccine.  Seasonal influenza vaccine s for injection 
are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed.  However,  intranasal influenza 
vaccines are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.  
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned  
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study.  Subjects may receive 
other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  The exclusion criteria 
describe other medications that are prohibited in this study.  Ther e are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_450719] -treatment follow -up period.

6.1. Screening  
Screening is the interval between signing the ICF and the day the subject is enrolled in the study 
(eg, Cycle 1 Day 1).  Screening may not exceed [ADDRESS_1013055] of care; 
however, procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine clinical management obtained 
before signing of informed consent may be used for screening or baseline purposes with approval 
of the medical monitor, provide d that the procedure meets the Protocol -defined criteria and has 
been performed in the timeframe of the study.  Assessments that are required to demonstrate 
eligibility may be performed over the course of [ADDRESS_1013056] who fails screening may repeat the screening process 1 time  if 
the investigator believes there has been a change in eligibility status (eg, after recovery from an 
infection).  Treatment should start as soon as possible after the date of enrollment.  
Incyte Biosciences  International S àrl Page  [ADDRESS_1013057] dose of study treatment  
(Cycle 1 Day 1) through the point at which the investigator determines that the subject will be 
permanently discontinued from study treatment, or for up to [ADDRESS_1013058] 
should be encouraged to return f or the safety and survival f ollow -up visits. 
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment w ill 
no longer be followed for survival beyond the last safety follow -up visit . 
6.4. Follow -Up 
6.4.1.  Safety Follow -Up 
The safety f ollow -up period  is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow -up 
visit, which should occur 30  days (+ 7 days) and 60 days (+ 7 days) after the last dose of study 
treatment.  Monitoring for the occurrence of new AEs should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_1013059] 
will move into the survival follow -up period . 
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, the safety follow -up visits will include AE and concomitant 
medication assessment only and may be c ompleted remotely (such as by [CONTACT_741034]).  
Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 5, if a new anticancer therapy has been initiated before the 
end of the safety follow -up period, no further survival follow -up assessment will be required 
beyond the last safety foll ow-up visit.  
6.4.2.  Disease Status Follow -Up 
Subjects who discontinue study treatment for a reason other than  disease progression 
(eg, toxicity) will move into the disease status follow -up period and should be assessed every 
8 weeks (± 7 days ), for [ADDRESS_1013060] 
information regarding disease status until:

Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 5, disease status follow -up will no longer be required beyond 
the last safety follow -up visit  for subjects who discontinue study treatment for a reason other 
than disea se progression.  The last disease status follow -up data will be recorded in the eCRF at 
the time of the last safety follow -up visit .  The last study visit will be the last safety follow -up 
visit.  
6.4.3.  Survival Follow -Up 
Once a subject has received the last dose  of study treatment , confirmed disease progression, or 
starts a new anticancer therapy,  the subject moves into the survival follow -up period and should 
be contact[CONTACT_5143], email, or visit at least every 12 weeks  (+ 7 days)  to assess for survival 
status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. 
Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 5, survival  follow -up will no longer be required  beyond the 
last safety follow -up visit  for subjects who have confirmed  disease progres sion or start a new 
anticancer therapy .  The last survival follow -up data will be recorded in the eCRF at the time of 
the last safety follow -up visit .  The last study visit will be the last safety follow -up visit.  
6.5. End of Study  
The end of the study will occur when all subjects have completed the last study follow -up visit or 
have discontinued study treatment  and have completed applicable follow -up assessments.  
Additionally, subjects will be considered as having completed the stu dy if they meet any of the 
following criteria:  
• Subject dies and a date of death is available.  
• Subject is known to have died; however, the date of death cannot be obtained.  
(NOTE :  Every effort must be made to obtain the date of death.)  
• Consent is withdrawn for any further contact [CONTACT_165913].  
− Every reasonable effort should be made to determine the reason a subject 
withdraws prematurely, and this information should be recorded in the eCRF.  
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_456].  
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_450744].  
6.6. Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled study visits may occur at any time if medically warranted.  Any assessments 
performed at those visits should be recorded in the eCRF.  
Incyte Biosciences  International S àrl Page  [ADDRESS_1013061] OF STUDY ASS ESSMENTS AND  PROCEDURES  
Individual study procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform these 
procedures at unscheduled timepoints if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed  necessary for reasons related to 
subject safety.  In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially sensitive in nature 
(eg, HIV, HCV), and thus local regulations may require that additional informed consent be 
obtained from the subject.  In these  cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in 
accordance with those regulations.  Per Section  3.1, subjects of childbearing potential must ag ree 
to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy in order to participate in the study 
(Appendix  A). 
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained from the study subject before conducting any 
study -specific procedures using an ICF approved by [CONTACT_1036]/IEC that contains all elements 
required by [CONTACT_12212] E6 and describes the nature, scope, and possible conse quences of the study in a 
form understandable to the study subject.  Additional consent may also be required per local 
regulatory agencies.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and administration must 
be followed; the original signed ICF mus t be retained by [CONTACT_093], and a copy of the 
signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed consent process for each subject 
must be documented in writing within the subject source documentation.  
7.2. Interactive Response Technology System Procedure  
The site will contact [CONTACT_741050] a subject identification number when a subject enters the 
prescreening phase.  Upon determining that the subject is eligible for study entry, the IRT will be 
contact[CONTACT_741051].  Additionally, the IRT will be contact[CONTACT_741052] 's disposition, disease response, and for study drug resupply.  Refer to the IRT 
manual for detailed instructions.   
During Phase [ADDRESS_1013062] 's malignancy under study including date of diagnosis, initial and current 
cancer stage, tumor histology, relevant disease characteristics, and prior treatments including 
systemic, radiation, and surgical procedures will be recorded.  
7.4. Prior and Concomitant Medication s and Procedures  
Prior and concomitant medications and procedures will be reviewed to determine subject 
eligibility.  Any medication received or procedure performed within [ADDRESS_1013063] 
will be maintained after signing the ICF to document concomitant medications, including any 
changes to the dose or regimen.  Concomitant medications include any prescription, 
over-the-counter, or natural/herbal preparations taken or administered during the study period.  
Concomitant treatments and/o r procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical 
condition during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF.  See Section  5.[ADDRESS_1013064] dose of the new anticancer therapy.  
Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 5, information on new anticancer therapy will no longer be 
collected beyond the last safety follow -up visit . 
7.6. Safety Assessments  
Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_741016] ; therefore, the investigator should refer to and 
follow the safety management guidelines as appropriate within the  approved  package insert for 
both compounds.  
Incyte Biosciences  International S àrl Page  [ADDRESS_1013065] signs the ICF.  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs 
throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, 
nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling?"  All AEs (serious  and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and eCRFs regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug.  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in Section  8. 
7.6.2.  Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician's assistant, or an advanced regi stered nurse practitioner, as local law 
permits.  Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the 
judgement of the investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Comprehensive Physical  Examination  
The comprehensive physical exam ination will include assessment(s) of the following organ or 
body systems:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; 
abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities; and lymph nodes, as well as a brief neurological 
examination.   The screening physical examination should also include a measurement of height.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Targeted Physical  Examination  
The targeted physical examination will be a symptom -directed evaluation conducted by [CONTACT_92685] a medically qualified designee.  The ta rgeted physical examination will include 
assessment(s) of the body systems or organs, as indicated by [CONTACT_106216], AEs, or other 
findings.   
7.6.3.  Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature .  
Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the subject in the recumbent, semirecumbent , or 
sitting position after [ADDRESS_1013066] from  the study treatment based on 
an ECG flagged as "Abnormal, Cli nically Significant"  is the responsibility of the investigator, in 
consultation with the m edical monitor, as appropriate.   Clinically notable abnormalities that are 
considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator  are to be reported as  AEs.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  In the event that a single QTc is >  [ADDRESS_1013067] may enroll if the 
average QTc for the 3 ECGs is <  470 milliseconds  or with approval from the medical monitor .  
For subjects with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS  interval > 120 milliseconds) at 
screening, the JTc interval may be used in place of the QTc with medical monitor  approval.  In 
addition, the JTc interval should be used for all subsequent assessments.  
7.6.5.  Laboratory Assessments  
A certified laboratory local to  the study site and subject will perform all clinical laboratory 
assessments for safety (ie, blood chemistries, hematology assessments, coagulation tests, 
endocrine function, and urinalysis).  The investigative site will enter the laboratory results and 
laboratory normal ranges into the eCRF.  All local laboratory assessments should be performed 
using standard procedures on the days indicated in Table  11.  Table  [ADDRESS_1013068] be performed before study drug administration.  After Cycle 1, predose 
laboratory procedures can be conducted up to 72 hours before study drug admini stration (within 
the 3 -day study window), and results should be reviewed by [CONTACT_450746] a new cycle of treatment is initiated.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy Testing  
A local laboratory serum pregnancy test will be re quired for all women of childbearing potential 
during screening and at EOT.  The serum pregnancy test performed at screening must be 
performed within [ADDRESS_1013069] dose of study drug.  Urine pregnancy tests will be 
performed locally as outlined  in Table  11, as medically indicated (eg, in case of loss of menstrual 
cycle , when pregnancy is suspected ), or per country -specific requirements (note t hat 
country -required urine  pregnancy testing will be outlined and communicated to investigational 
sites under separate cover ).  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, then the results should be 
confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.  
If the serum pregnancy  test is negative after a urine test was positive, then the investigator will 
assess the potential benefit/risk to the subject and determine whether it is in the subject's best 
interest to resume study treatment and continue participation in the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hepatitis Screening Tests  
Hepatitis screening assessments will be performed at the screening visit ( Table  11) to rule out 
hepatitis infection; required analytes are shown in  Table  12.  Generally, hepatitis tests should be 
performed early in the screening process due to the length of time needed to obtain the results.  
Additional tests may be performed if clinically indicat ed. 
Incyte Biosciences  International S àrl Page  [ADDRESS_1013070] will be applied by [CONTACT_165929] a basis for Protocol guidelines related to disease status (eg, discontinuation of 
study therapy).  As noted in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , RECIST v1.1 has been adapted to account for the 
unique tumor responses seen with immunotherapy ( Wolchok et al 2009 ). 
If radiologic imaging shows progressive disease, tumor assessment should be repeated at a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_1013071]'s clinical status once the 
initial scan showing radiologic evidence of progression is observed.  
Subjects may receive treatment while waiting for confirmation of progression if the y are 
clinically stable as defined by [CONTACT_4868]:  
• Absence of clinically significant signs and symptoms (including worsening of 
laboratory values) indicating disease progression . 
• No decline in ECOG performance status.  
• Absence of rapid progressio n of disease.  
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention .

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].2.  Tumor Imaging During the Study  
The first imaging assessment should be performed [ADDRESS_1013072] dose of 
INCAGN01876 and then every 8 weeks (56 days ± 7 days), for [ADDRESS_1013073] met the conditions detailed in Section  7.7.1 .  A central imaging vendor will not be used in 
this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Imaging During Follow -Up 
If the subject discontinues study treatment  for reasons other than disease progression, imaging 
assessments should continue at the Protocol -specified interval until documented disease 
progression, the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consen t, death, or the end of the 
study, whichever occurs first.  
Note :  As of Protocol A mendment 5, follow -up imaging to monitor disease status is no longer 
required beyond the last safety follow -up visit  (see Section  6.4.2 ) for subjects who discontinue 
study treatment for reasons other than disease progression.  
7.8. Performance and Quality -of-Life Assessments  
7.8.1.  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status  
The ECOG performance status will be assessed as shown in Table  [ADDRESS_1013074] of the date/time of the next visit, as well as any necessary instructions.   
7.11.2.  Data Collection for Survival Follow -Up 
For subjects having entered the survival  follow -up period of the study , the site will u se 
continuing subject  records to supply data on subsequent treatment regimens, tumor assessments 
(if discontinued treatment for a reason other than progression), and OS in the eCRF.  For subjects 
who do not intend to return to the study investigator  for th eir ongoing care, follow -up should be 
maintained by [CONTACT_89205] , patient  records, and public records/databases  at intervals of no 
longer than 12 weeks .  After the final primary analysis is performed,  the follow -up interval for 
subsequent anticancer treat ments and survival may be reduced to every 16 weeks or eliminated 
(see Section  6.4.3 ). 
Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 5, data collection for survival follow -up is  no longer required  
beyond the last safety follow -up visit .  The last survival follow -up data will be recorded in the 
eCRF at the time of the last safety follow -up visit . 

Incyte Biosciences  International S àrl Page  [ADDRESS_1013075] provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or tes t results occurring 
after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are 
considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg, hematologic abnormality that requires 
transfusion), or require changes in the study drug(s) . 
8.1.2.  Reporting  
Adverse events that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events form of the eCRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in the eC RF.  Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new AEs should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_1013076].  Adverse events (including laboratory 
abnormalities that con stitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible 
rather than by [CONTACT_147108].   
The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, should no t be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is considered more 
severe than expected for the participant's condition or considered to be treatment -related by [CONTACT_1275].  Additionally, efficacy endpoints as outlined in Section  2.2 will not be reported as 
AE/SAEs, specifically, any event that is related to disease progression of the cancer under study.  
Unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and s afety data will be monitored to ensure the 
safety of the subjects in the study.  Any suspected endpoint that upon review is not progression 
of the cancer under study will be forwarded to Incyte Pharmacovigilance as an SAE within 
24 hours of determination t hat the event is not progression of the cancer under study.  
The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v4.03 Grades 1 through 5.  If an event is not 
classified by [CONTACT_3989], the severity of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to 
estimate t he grade of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care activities of daily living.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade [ADDRESS_1013077], or other assessments.  To the 
extent possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine:  
• The severity grade (CTCAE Gr ade 1 to 5). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no).  
− Note :  causality assessment for each agent administered per study must be 
indicated.  
• The start and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow -up. 
• The action taken with regard to study drug.  
• The event outcome (eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown).  
• The seriousness, as per  SAE definition provided in Section  8.3.[ADDRESS_1013078] special reporting 
requirements  (see Section  8.3.2 ). 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on Adverse Event form and the treatment should 
be specified on the Prior/Concomitant Medications or Procedures and Non -Drug Therapy form 
in the eCRF.  
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it has resolved or until it is judg ed to be 
permanent; assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event, and the outcome.  
When the severity of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits), each 
change in severity will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
[ADDRESS_1013079] Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require 
interruption of  study treatment ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in the eCRF.  
Whenever possible, a diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, "anemia" instead 
of "low hemoglobin").  Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be 
followed until they have  returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is 
found.  When an abnormal laboratory test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a 
previously reported AE, it is not necessary to separately record the laboratory test result as an 
additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities that do not meet the definition of an AE should not be reported as AEs.  
A Grade  3 or 4 (severe) AE does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition 
of serious, as defined in Section  8.3.1 .  A dose modification for the laboratory abnormality may 
be required (see Section  5.4) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test 
abnormality as an SAE.  
8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1.  Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal or l ife-threatening.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a result of:  
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition.  
− An elec tive surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the 
ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of  a SAE and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
− Any social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], in the absence of any deterioration in the 
subject's general condition.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or a substantial disruption of 
a perso n's ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is considered to be an important medical event or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospit alization but 
may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  8.3.2.  Reporting  
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug(s) or study 
procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the last 
study visit (or [ADDRESS_1013080] receives a new 
anticancer therapy whichever occurs earlier) must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 
[ADDRESS_1013081] a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the 
specific study treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference 
Guide for Completing the Serious Adverse Event Report Form.  
The contact [CONTACT_89208]'s study -specific representatives is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.  The origi nal copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the ini tial SAE Report 
Form was sent.  Follow -up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, 
with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The follow -up report should include informa tion that was not provided on the previous 
SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose interrupted or 
discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).  Each 
recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow -up to 
that event.  
If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug (new occurrence) and is thought t o be 
related to the sponsor's study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently require further 
information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities.  The sponsor or its designee 
may need to issue an Investigator Notification to inform all investigators involved in any study 
with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reactions will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics 
committees in accordance with Direct ive 2001/20/EC, or as per national regulatory requirements

• The study treatment must be discontinued immediately (female subjects only).  
• The investigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy.  
• A serum preg nancy test must be performed to confirm the urine pregnancy test result.  
If a negative serum test does not confirm the urine pregnancy result, then:  
− The investigator will use his or her expert judgment, based on an assessment of 
the potential benefit/risk  to the subject, to determine whether it is in the subject's 
best interest to resume study treatment and continue participation in the study.  
• The EOT visit evaluations must be performed.  
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety 
evaluation.  Follow -up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by [CONTACT_147109] -baby [CONTACT_765].  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
and reported by [CONTACT_89211].  Pregnancy follow -up information 
shoul d be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal 
relationship to the sponsor's study drug to any pregnancy outcome, as well as follow -up to the 
first well -baby [CONTACT_89212], whic hever is later.  Refer to the

dose would be escalated.  If the MTD is not determined at the highest dose level tested during 
the study, then the MTD is at or above the highest dose level.  The MTD is below the lowes t 
dose level of INCAGN01876 if the Cohor t 1 dose is not well -tolerated.  
9.2.2.  Sample Size for Phase 2  
Phase 2 will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy,  
 of the recommended dose of INCAGN01876 in combinati on with immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_741017].  In Phase 2, a Simon 2 -stage design will be 
run for the cervical cancer, gastric cancer, SCCHN and PD -1/PD -L1 relapsed melanoma cohorts 
within a given doublet or triplet treatm ent group.  A Simon 2 -stage design with an expansion 
stage will be used for the PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort.  
The sample size for each tumor type within a given doublet or triplet expansion cohort will be 
guided by [CONTACT_144122] 2 -stage design  (except for the PD-1 refractory SCCHN cohort in Treatment 
Group F).  The planned  Simon [ADDRESS_1013085]  a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_450714] a particular tumor type within the 
given treatment combination at the end of Stage 1 if there is insufficient response observed 
(calculated response rate < p0), while enrolling enough subjects to predict possi ble target 
responses (≥ p1) worthy of cohort expansion and potentially further evaluation in future studies.  
The individual Simon [ADDRESS_1013086] design parameters that are determined by [CONTACT_741053].  
The same Simon 2 -stage design parameters will be used for alternative dosing sequences in the 
same tumor type and treatment combination.  For example, the gastric cohorts in Treatment 
Groups F, G, and H will all us e the same Simon 2 -stage parameters.  
In order to determine whether the target response rate ( p1) is likely, an initial number of 
evaluable subjects ( n1 subjects) treated at the MTD or PAD and schedule of INCAGN01876 
within the corresponding doublet or triplet expansion cohort will be enrolled in a cohort 
(Stage  1).  If there are r1 or fewer responses in the cohort, it will be concluded that the true 
response rate is unlikely to be greater than or equal to the target rate, and no more subjects will 
be enrolled in that tumor type in Stage 2.  In the cohorts in which greater than r1 responses are 
observed among the Stage  1 subjects, n2 additional evaluable s ubjects will be treated in Stage  2 
to estimate the response rate.  At the end of Stage 2, if ≤ r subjects have responded among the n 
evaluable subjects, the doublet or triplet schedule will be declared nonpromising for that cohort.

multiple expansion cohorts.   For other endpoints, confidence intervals  will be reported at a  95% 
confidence level.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Analyses  
In Phase 2, the proportion of subjects who meet the objective response criteria (CR + PR) per 
RECIST v1.1 will be summarized by [CONTACT_44847].  
For the cohorts using a Simo n 2-stage design, if there are no resp onses in each tumor type –
specific doublet or triplet treatment group out of the n1 evaluable subjects specific to that tumor 
type–specific doublet or triplet treatment group (consistent with a calculated response rate < p0) 
at Stage 1, then the study will be stopped for futility, and the null hypothesis is not rejected.  
Otherwise, in the tumor types in which greater than r1 responses among the evaluable Stage 1 
subjects is observed, where r1 is also specific to the tumor type and doublet or triplet expansion 
cohort, an additional n2 evaluable subjects will be treated in Stage 2.  If there are ≤ r responders 
among the evaluable subjects at the end of Stage 2, then the drug will be declared non promising 
for that tumor type within the given doublet or triplet expansion cohort, and the null hypothesis 
is not rejected.  Further investigation of the study drug will be considered interesting (predictive 
of ≥ p1 response rate) if > r responses are obs erved in the first n evaluable subjects.   
For the PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort using a Simon 2 -stage design with an expansion stage, if 
there is an insufficient number of responses observed at the end of Stage 1  or Stage 2, the cohort 
will be terminated e arly for futility.  If the number of responders observed is > r1 for Stage 1 and 
> r2 for Stage 2, an additional number of evaluable subjects needed for the next stage ( n2 and n3, 
respectively) will be enrolled.  At the end of the expansion stage, if the n umber of responders 
observed is ≤ r among the n evaluable subjects, then the drug will be declared nonpromising for 
the PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort.  If > r responders are observed, the drug will be declared 
promising for further investigation.

A TEAE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre -existing event after 
first dose of study drug.  Ana lysis of AEs will be limited to TEAEs, but data listings will include 
all AEs regardless of their timing to study drug administration.  Adverse events will be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_169108].  Severity of AEs will be based on the 
NCI CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_1013089] ug, the AE will be considered treatment -related.  The incidence of AEs and 
treatment -related AEs will be tabulated.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Laboratory test values outside the normal range will be assessed for severity based on the normal 
ranges for the c linical reference laboratory.  The incidence of abnormal laboratory values and 
shift tables relative  to baseline will be tabulated.  
Laboratory data will be classified into Grades 1 through 5 using CTCAE v4.03.   The following 
summaries will be produced for the laboratory data:  
• Number and percentage of subjects with worst postb aseline CTC AE grade (regardless 
of baseline value).  Each subject will be counted only for the worst grade observed 
postbaseline.  
• Shift ta bles from  baseline to the worst postbaseline value using  CTC AE grade.  
• For laboratory parameters where CTC AE grades are not defined, shift tables to the 
worst postbaseline value using the low/normal/high  classifications based on 
laboratory reference ranges.

A second approach to determining whether the treatment is active or not across the cohorts will 
use an integrated  Bayesian analysis  of tumor and dosing  strategies based on Simon  et al ( 2016 ).  
The integrated Bayesian analysis wi ll be used for the cervical cancer, gastric cancer, and SCCHN 
cohorts.   Pooling is performed within dosing strategies and tumor types to determine if 
INCAGN01876 is active within any of the given dosing  strategies, given tumor types, or given 
dosing  strate gy-tumor type combinations.   The first Bayesian pooling analysis  will allow sharing 
of information within a  tumor type  across dosing strategies  based on a joint Bayesian prior.  The 
joint Bayesian prior incorporates the unacceptable and target response rat es from the Simon 
2-stage designs with a parameter indicating the prior probability of homogeneity within the 
tumor types, which controls the degree of information sharing.  A separate analysis will allow 
sharing of information for dosing strategies  across tumor types using a separate joint Bayesian 
prior.  For this analysis, the joint Bayesian prior incorporates the unacceptable and target 
response rates from the Simon [ADDRESS_1013090] is enrolled, two PoS calculations will be 
performed using the evaluable subjects:  the PoS in tumor type (tumor type i and dosing strategy j), 
PoS 1ij, and PoS within dosing strategy  (tumor type i and dosing strategy j), PoS 2ij. 
Based on the results of the 2 calculated posterior PoS values, a tumor -sequence  pair ( i,j) will be 
considered open for enrollment  if and only if  either  PoS 1ij ≥ 20% or PoS 2ij ≥ 20%.  Otherwise the 
tumor -sequence  pair will be suspended.  
At the end of the study, overall PoS tests will be performed using both PoS 1ij and PoS 2ij.  A 
tumor -sequence  strategy will be considered successful if either PoS 1ij or PoS 2ij > 80%.

The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the specified 
study drug.  These records should incl ude dates, quantities, and any available batch or serial 
numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and study subjects.  
Completed accountability records will be archived by [CONTACT_779].  The investigator or designee will 
be expecte d to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug 
until verified by [CONTACT_11200] (unless otherwise agreed to by [CONTACT_456]).  At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of an y remaining 
study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional standard 
operating procedures.  If local procedures mandate on -site destruction of investigational supply, 
the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study 
monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of 
accountability by [CONTACT_3878].  At sites where the study drug is destroyed before 
monitor inspection,  the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP.

and regulations.  The investigator and the sponsor or its designee are re sponsible for ensuring 
that sensitive  personal  information is ha ndled in accordance with local data protection laws 
(including but not limited to  HIPAA  and GDPR ) as applicable .  Appropriate consent for 
collection, use and disclosure and/or transfer (if app licable) of personal  information must be 
obtained  in accordance with local data protection laws . 
Incyte Biosciences  International S àrl Page  [ADDRESS_1013092]'s initials (subject's initials will only be recorded if  allowable by [CONTACT_427]) will be 
recorded in the eCRF, where permitted; if the subject's name [CONTACT_741059] 
(eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to the 
sponsor or its designee.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with  
appropriate technical and organizational measures as required by  [CONTACT_89227].  The 
subjects will be informed that representatives of the sponsor or its designee, IRB or IE C, or 
regulatory authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and 
that all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence 
and in accordance with local data protection laws.  
10.5. Financial Disclosure  
Before study initiation, all clinical investigators participating in clinical studies subject to FDA 
Regulation Title 21 CFR Part 54 – Financial Disclosure by [CONTACT_6230] (ie, "covered 
studies") are required to submit a completed Clinical Investigator Financial Disclosure form that 
sufficiently details any financial interests and arrangements that apply.  For the purpose of this 
regulation, "clinical investigator" is defined as any investigator or subinvestigator who is d irectly 
involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects, including the spouse and each 
dependent child of the clinical investigator or subinvestigator.  These requirements apply to both 
US and foreign clinical investigators conducting covered clinical studies.  
Any new clinical investigators added to the covered clinical study during its conduct must also 
submit a completed Investigator Financial Disclosure Form.  During a covered clinical study, 
any changes to the financial information previous ly reported by a clinical investigator must be 
reported to the sponsor or its designee.  At the conclusion of the covered clinical study, the 
clinical investigators will be reminded of their obligations.  In the event that the clinical 
investigator is not reminded, they nevertheless will remain obligated to report to the sponsor or 
its designee any changes to the financial information previously reported, as well as any changes 
in their financial information for a period of 1 year after completion of the co vered clinical study.  
10.6. Publication Policy  
By [CONTACT_89228], the investigator and his /her institution agree that the results of the 
study may be used by [CONTACT_456], Incyte Biosciences International  Sàrl (Incyte), for the 
purposes of national an d international registration, publication, and information for medical and 
pharmaceutical professionals.  Study results will be published in accordance with applicable 
local and national regulations.  If necessary, the authorities will be notified of the i nvestigator's 
name, address, qualifications, and extent of involvement.  The terms regarding the publication of 
study results are contained in the agreement signed with the sponsor or its designee.  A signed 
agreement will be retained by [CONTACT_741056].  
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is foreseen, 
the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor before submission.  
This allows the sponsor to protect proprietar y information and to provide comments.  
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results.  In accordance 
with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support publication of

coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12992].  
Authorship will be determined in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
authorship requirements and t he sponsor's internal publication guidelines.  
10.7. Study and Site Closure  
The sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor.  Study sites will be closed upo n study 
completion.  A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies 
have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is rea sonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_11004]:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the Protocol, t he requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines.  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_093].  
• Discontinuation of further study treatment development.

hypothyroidism.  Subjects may present with fatigue, headache, mental status 
changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or nonspecific 
symptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying 
disease.  Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of 
endocrinopathies should be considered immune -mediated.  
For Grade 2 (mild to moderate new symptoms):  
• In hypophysitis, treat with systemic corticosteroids , per institutional standard 
of care.  When symptoms improve to Grade  1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
Note:  These suggested supportive care measures a lso apply to Grade 3 
hypophysitis   
• In hyperthyroidism, nonselective beta -blockers (eg, propranolol) are suggested 
as initial therapy.  
• In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine 
or liothyronine, is indicated per standard of c are. 
Note:   Isolated hypothyroidism may be treated with replacement therapy 
without treatment interruption and without corticosteroids.  
• Evaluate endocrine function and, as clinically indicated, consider pi[INVESTIGATOR_450725].  
• For subjects with abnormal endocrine work -up, except for those with isolated 
hypothyroidism, consider short -term, high -dose c orticosteroids 
(eg, methylprednisolone or IV equivalent) and initiate appropriate hormone 
replacement therapy.  
• For subjects with normal endocrine work -up (labs or MRI),  repeat labs/MRI as 
clinically indicated.  
For Grade 3 or 4 (severe or new symptoms, new/worsening  endocrinopathies , 
life threatening):  
• Hypothyroidism may be treated with replacement therapy without treatment 
interruption and without corticosteroids.  
• In hyperthyroidism, t reat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by 
[CONTACT_78019].  Consider initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 
1-2 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent, and initiate appropriate 
hormone replacement the rapy.   Once improving, gradually taper 
immunosuppressive steroids over ≥ 4 weeks.  
• In hypophysitis, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_79918].  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started  and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Replacement of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• For adrenal crisis, severe dehydration, hypotension, or shock:   immediately 
initiate intravenous corticosteroids with mineralocor ticoid activity.

Neuropathies  Note:   Monitor subjects for symptoms of motor or sensory neuropathy such as 
unilateral or bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, or paresthesia.  
For Grade 2 (mild to moderat e new symptoms):  
• Consider systemic corticosteroids per institutional standard of care in addition 
to appropriate symptomatic treatment.  
• If no improvement within 3 -5 days, consider additional work -up and consider 
treating with additional immunosuppressive therapy (eg, IV IgG) , after 
discussing with the medical monitor . 
For Grade 3 or 4 (severe or new symptoms, new/worsening  neuropathies , life 
threatening):  
• Consider initiation of systemic corticosteroids (IV administration should be 
strongly considered) for severe neuropathies.  
• Institute medical intervention as appropriate for management of severe 
neuropathy.  
• If no improvement within 3 -5 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_159813], consider 
additional workup and consider  treating with a dditional immunosuppressants 
(eg, IV IgG)  after discussing with the medical monitor . 
• Once stable, gradually taper steroids over ≥ 4 weeks.

Amendment (Version) 1 : 12 JUN 2017  
Amendment (Version) 2 : 22 AUG 2017  
Amendment (Version) 3:  18 DEC 2017  
Amendment (Version) 4:  [ADDRESS_1013104] 2018  
Amendment (Version) 5:  22 JAN 2021  
Amendment 5 ( 22 JAN 2021 ) 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to provide guidance for the management of ongoing 
subjects, as enrollment is complete and sufficient data have been collected for primary and 
secondary endpoint analysis.  
1. Synopsis; Section 5.5.1, Withdrawal Criteria; Section 5.5.2, Withdrawal 
Procedures; Section 6, Study Assessments  (Table 1 0:  Schedule of Clinical 
Assessments); Section 6.3, End of Treatment; Section  6.4.1, Safety Follow -Up; 
Section 6.4.2, Disease Status Follow -Up; Section  6.4.3, Survival Follow -Up; 
Section  7.5, Poststudy Anticancer Therapy Status; Section  7.7.1. 1.3, Imaging During 
Follow -Up; Section 7.11.2, Data Collection for Survival Follow -Up 
Descrip tion of change:   Disease status and survival follow -up data will only be collected 
until the last safety follow -up visit.   Safety follow -up visits will only include AE and 
concomitant medication assessments.  
Rationale for change:  To update the study asses sments as enrollment is complete and 
all ongoing subjects have  either been on study treatment for more than 15 months or are 
in follow -up after treatment discontinuation (for any of the treatment withdrawal criteria 
outlined in Section  5.5). 
2. Section 10.1.1 , Identification of the Coordinating Principal Investigator; 
Section  10.6, Publication Policy ; Section 10.7, Study and Site Closure  
Description of change:   Included the  process for  identification of the coordinating 
principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_741024].  Clarified the policy for study 
publications.  
Rationale for change:  To update applicable sections as per current protocol template . 
3. Incorporation of administrative changes:  Other minor administrative changes have 
been incorporated throughout the Protocol to correct inadvertent inconsistencies or 
improve the readability and are noted in the redline version of the amendment.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  • Other relevant sections were updated accordingly and are noted in the redline version 
of the amendment.  
Rationale for change:   A large proportion of patients fail to respond to anti –PD-1 
treatmen t; there are very limited remaining treatment options available.  Combining an 
anti-GITR and an anti –PD-1 treatment may synergistically restore T -cell activation, 
enhance antitumor immunity, and overcome the resistance of tumors to the PD -1 therapy.  
3. Synops is; Section 3.1, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Addition of a note to inclusion criterion 6c that subjects with 
SCCHN enrolled in Stage [ADDRESS_1013105] progressive 
disease during or within 6 months afte r their platinum -based therapy.  
Rationale for change:  To more closely define the SCCHN population to be enrolled in 
Stage 2 of the Phase 2 portion of the study . 
4. Synopsis; Section 4.3.1, Planned Number of Subjects  
Description of change:   The total number of subjects to be enrolled in the Phase  [ADDRESS_1013106] population 
(ie, addition of subjects with PD -1 refractory SCCHN to Treatment Group F) in the Phase 
2 portion of the study.  
Rationale for change:   The sample size is guided by [CONTACT_144122] 2 -stage design for 
cervical, gastric, SCCHN, and PD -1/L-1 relapsed melanoma tumor types within a given 
doublet or triplet treatment group and Simon 2 -stage design with an expansion stage for 
the PD-1 refractory SCCHN cohort in Treatment G roup F.  
5. Synopsis; Section 5.2.2, Standard Immune Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_658628]:   Update in the infusion times for nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
Rationale for change:   Following recent updates to the recommended infusion times for 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_741025], the recommended infusion 
times of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_741026]/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_741027].  
6. Section [IP_ADDRESS], Subjects With Melanoma Who Have Relapsed After Prior 
Treatment With an Anti –PD-1 or Anti –PD-L1 Therapy  
Description of change:  Reference to melanoma subjects has been added to this section.  
Rationale for change:   Reference to subjects with melanoma has been made to clarify 
that this section describes the rationale for inclusion of melanoma subjects who have 
relapsed after prior tre atment with an anti –PD-1 or anti –PD-L1 therapy.  
7. Section 3.1, Inclusion Criteria; Section 7.10.1, Tumor Biopsies  
Description of change:  Updated the requirements for the amount of previously collected 
formalin -fixed paraffin embedded baseline tumor tissue m aterial.  
Rationale for change:   To allow for more flexibility with respect to the amount of 
available previously collected baseline tumor tissue material required for eligibility.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  8. Synopsis; Section 4.1, Overall Study Design; Section 5.2, Study Drugs ; Section 6, 
Study Assessments; Section  [IP_ADDRESS], Tumor Tissue Collection Requirements  
Description of change:   Section 4.1 was updated to include the following changes; other 
relevant sections were updated accordingly.  
• The Phase [ADDRESS_1013107] population was up dated to remove endometrial cancer, 
include cervical cancer, and include PD -1 or PD -L1 relapsed melanoma.  
• Language was added to allow for alternate dose administration schedules and/or 
fixed doses of INCAGN01876 comparable to or less than the highest dose levels 
determined to be safe or pharmacologically active in the Phase 2 portion of the 
study.  
• Figure 1 (Overall Study Design) was updated to reflect changes made to the 
subject population and treatment groups.  
• Treatment Group G (run -in with INCAGN01876 × 2  doses followed by 
[CONTACT_741057]) and Treatment Group K (run -in with INCAGN01876 × 
2 doses followed by [CONTACT_20382] + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) were removed from the study.  
Treatment Group E was updated from sequenced INCAGN01876 × 2 doses 
followed by [CONTACT_741058] d ipi[INVESTIGATOR_741028] a run -in with INCAGN01876 × 
2 doses followed by [CONTACT_741036]01876 concurrent with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
• A new Treatment Group C2 (INCAGN01876 + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) was added to the 
Phase 2 portion of the study.  
Rationale for change:   The rationale fo r the subject population and fixed dosing are 
described above.  
Removal of Treatment Groups G and K and revision of Treatment Group E to sequenced 
INCAGN01876 × [ADDRESS_1013108] not shown sufficient clinical responses or meaningful translational 
changes in immune markers for subjects enrolled in Treatment Group B.  However, a 
clinical response and chang es in immune markers were observed in Treatment Group A 
(concurrent dosing).  Therefore, treatment groups investigating sequential monotherapy 
dosing schedule will no longer be explored in the Phase 2 portion of the study.  
Treatment Group C (INCAGN01876 + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) will be expanded in the Phase 2 
portion of the study (as Treatment Group C2).  This is based on emerging clinical and 
translational data from the Phase 1 portion of the study showing clinical responses and 
meaningful translational changes in im mune markers for subjects enrolled in Treatment 
Group  C.

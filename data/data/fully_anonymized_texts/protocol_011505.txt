Clinical Study Protocol  APD334- 201 
Etrasimod Versus Placebo in Subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (ADVISE)  Amendment 1.[ADDRESS_557554] cause of disability worldwide ( Karimkhani 2017). Atopic 
dermatitis (AD , also known as atopic e czema) is the most common chronic relapsing , 
inflammatory  skin disease. T he lifetime prevalence of AD is 10% to  20% in developed nations, 
and appears to be increas ing (Weidinger 2016, Heratizadeh 2017). 
AD is more common in children. It is estimated that 90% of individuals with AD develop their 
first symptoms by [CONTACT_654] 5 , and in approximately 60% of cases it manifests during the first year of 
life (Weidinger 2016, Boguniewicz 2017). The nature of AD is relapsing and remitting and 
patients diagnosed as children  may even  experience spontaneous disease remission later in 
adolescence ( Bieber 2008 , Eichenfield 2014). However, AD can remain  a chronic and lifelong 
condition, with prevalence in adults ranging from 7% to  10% ( Boguniewicz 2017). In a clinical 
study population, it was found that 50% of AD patients had been living with active disease for 
more than 27 years (Simpson 2016b). 
AD is characterized by [CONTACT_439820][INVESTIGATOR_3915] -barrier 
function resulting in dry, red, skin and intense itch ( Bieber 2008, Weidinger 2016). Essential 
features for diagnosis of AD are pruritus, eczematous dermatitis, and a chronic or relapsing 
history of disease ( Weidinger 2016, Boguniewicz 2017). P atients with AD are more likely to 
have other allergic or atopic conditions. In a 2016 study of 380 adults with moderate -to-severe 
AD, 51.3% had allergic rhinitis, 40.3% had asthma, 24.2% had allergic conjunctivitis, and 60.5% 
had other allergies.  The disease burden of those with AD significantly  impacts quality of life and 
patients report that their  condition affects social and leisure activities (43.9%), work or studying 
(41.8%), and even clothing choice (57.9%) ( Simpson 2016a ). 
A combination of genetic, environmental, and immunologic fact ors appears to determine disease 
predisposition, while the pathogenesis of AD is thought to stem from the mutually reinforcing 
interaction between a disrupted epi[INVESTIGATOR_439799] ( Weidinger 2016, Heratizadeh 2017). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_439800], immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization, and bacterial colonization 
(particularly Staphylococcus aureus ), which  induce persistent type 2 helper T cell responses 
(Salava 2014, Zhu 2018). 
There are currently  various  topi[INVESTIGATOR_439801], including corticosteroids, moisturizers, and systemic 
immunosuppressants. However, these current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_439802], safety 
profiles that prohibit long- term use, limited efficacy that provides only transient or marginal 
symptomatic relief, invasive administration procedures, or off- label use.  Thus , there r emains a 
great unmet medical need for an effective, safe, and orally administered t reatment .

Clinical Study Protocol  APD334- 201 
Etrasimod Versus Placebo in Subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (ADVISE)  Amendment 1.[ADDRESS_557555] ACTIVITIES AND RESTRICTIONS  
For dosing requirements, including holding the dose prior to the study visit on study visit days , 
see Dosage and Administration, Section  6.3. Rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_439803] /procedures are located in  Section  6.8.2 and  Section  6.8.3, respectively . 
Optimized skin care is expected to be followed prior to and maintained throughout the study as 
per current guidelines and recommendations for AD ( Eichenfield 2014, Eichenfield 2017). 
Subjects are expected to continue their u sual skin care routine and basic skin care regimen 
without notable changes for the course of the study treatment and follow-up periods. This 
includes frequency and le ngth of showering or bathing, including bleach baths, the use of 
emollients , topi[INVESTIGATOR_12866], antihistamines, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_71840]- infective 
medicati ons. 
Subjects must be willing to apply topi[INVESTIGATOR_439804] 
≥ 1 week prior to the Baseline Visit and willing to continue daily application over the course of 
the study without change (ie, type, frequency, application). 
On visit days during the study, subjects should not apply any topi[INVESTIGATOR_439805]. Study treatment should also be held the day of clinic visits. Subjects will take their daily dose at the study site on study visit days.

Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 33 of 102 completed. Subjects will take their daily dose at the study site  on study visit days. The time of 
 sample collection and subsequent dosing should be documented. 
6.3.1. Instructions for Missed Dose(s)  
Subjects should be instructed that if they forget to take a dose, they can take the dose within 
8 hours of the norm al dosing time; otherwise, they should take their next dose at the regular time 
on the following day. If the subject vomits the tablet, he/she should be instructed not to take another tablet on the same day, but to take the next dose at the regular time on the following day. Subjects  should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_439821] 2 consecutive 
doses.  
6.3.2. Dose Interruptions  
If the investigator deems it necessary to withhold study treatment, temporary withholding is 
permitted for up to 3 days without obtaining prior approval from the Sponsor. If study treatment 
interruption ≥ [ADDRESS_557556]-dose cardiac monitoring as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] should be 
performed and/or discussed with the m edical monitor any time a subject misses a study treatment 
as follows: 
• ≥ [ADDRESS_557557] week  of study treatment  
• ≥ [ADDRESS_557558] iac monitoring as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] should be performed. 
6.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
For the Double-Blind T reatment  Period , subjects will be centrally assigned to randomized study 
treatment using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).  Details of the randomization 
methodology are provided in the s tatistical analysis plan (SAP).  
During the Open-Label Extension Period, all eligible subjects will receive the same treatment (no randomization). 
6.5. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
Subjects will self-administer  1 tablet once daily  (with water , either with or without food). T he 
tablet should be taken at approximately the same time each day, preferably in the morning. On visit days during the study, subjects should not apply any topi[INVESTIGATOR_439806]. Additionally, on study visit days, subjects should wait 
and take their dose at the study site after blood draws  and after all pre -dose 
assessments have been completed.

supply staff and designated safety staff), or study vendors. The IWRS will hold treatment codes 
for study treatment . 
The IW RS will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In t he case of an emergency, 
the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment is warranted  based upon medical necessity . Subject safety must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determination. If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, 
the medical monitor or Sponsor delegate must be notified within [ADDRESS_557560] be recorded in the source documentation 
and electronic case report form (eCRF), as applicable.  
Unblinding may occur after all subjects have completed the Double-Blind T reatment Period, 
including the S afety Follow-Up V isit. 
6.7. Treatment Compliance  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects are correctly instructed on how to take their study treatment and that each subject is fully compliant with their assigned treatment 
regimen. Subject compliance will be based on tablet counts  at specified study  visits ( Section  7.4 
and Appendix 1; Table 8 and Table 9). 
6.8. Concomitant Therapy

Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 48 of 102 10.3. Efficacy Assessments  
Multiple  parameters will be collected during the study to assess efficacy/effectiveness of  
etrasimod  including measures of AD severity, and patient -reported measures of AD symptoms 
and quality of life . Questionnaires and PRO  assessments should be administered prior to 
obtaining investigator assessments, safety and laboratory assessments, and study treatment 
administration. Refer to the study manual for instructions on the administration and use of all 
patient -reported instruments (including POEM and DLQI). 
Wherever  possible, to maintain consistency, the same individual at the site should administer the 
investigator assessments for the duration of the study. 
10.3.1. Eczema Area and Severity Index  
The EASI is a validated scoring system that grades the severity and extent  of A D (Tofte 1998, 
Hanifin 2001) . EASI is the core outcome measure for the clinical signs of AD , which has been 
used extensively in clinical studies. The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 
0 to 72. The EASI scoring assessment multiplies the percentage of the affected area in 4  specific 
disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching 
[excoriation], and lichenification), which will each be assessed for severity by [CONTACT_208020] a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (severe) . 
The EASI Area Score is documented for 4 regions of the body. Region  1: head and neck; 
Region  2: trunk (including genital area); Region  3: upper limbs; and Region 4: lower limbs 
(including buttocks), with  the area of AD involvement assessed as a percentage by [CONTACT_439825]334- 201 
Etrasimod Versus Placebo in Subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (ADVISE)  Amendment 1.0  
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 49 of 102 converted to a score of 0 to 6. In each body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to  9%), 
2 (10% to  29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to  69%), 5 (70% to  89%), or 6 (90% to  100%). 
The EASI  will be collected at time points according to the  
. 
10.3.2. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis  
The SCORAD is a validated measure of the extent and severity of AD. There are 3  components 
to the assessment: A  = extent or affected BSA , B = severity, and C = subjective symptoms. The 
extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each  defined body area and reported as the sum of all 
areas, with a maximum  score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD calculation). 
The severity of 6  specific  symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin 
thickening/lichenification, dryness) is assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1), 
moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18  total points, assigned as “B” in the overall 
SCORAD calculation). Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each

sleeplessness) and [ADDRESS_557573] imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum p ossible 
score of 20. This parameter  is assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculation. The 
SCORAD is calculated as: A/5  + 7B/2  + C where the maximum is 103 ( European- Task -Force -

The vIGA scale for AD is a [ADDRESS_557574] describe the overall appearance of skin lesions at a given time point 
using the following scoring: 0 = clear (no inflammatory signs of AD); 1  = almost clear (barely 
perceptible erythema and papulation); 2 = mild (slight but definite  erythema and papulation); 
3 = moderate ( clearly perceptible  erythema and papulation); and 4 = severe ( marked  erythema 
papulation) ( vIGA -ADTM 2017).The vIGA  will be performed at time points according to the

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale 
The pruritus NRS is a simple assessment tool that subjects  will use to report the intensity of their  
pruritus (itch) . The scale for the pruritus NRS is from 0 to 10 with 0 being “no itch ” and 10 being 
“the worst itch imaginable. ” 
At Baseline and subsequent visits, subj ects will be asked to rate the intens ity of their itch 
(maximum/peak  and average)  over the previous 7 days . Subjects will also be asked to rate their 
average itch intensity over the previous 24 hours and their maximum itch intensity in a daily 
diary  (Stander 2013, PruritusResources 2019). 
The pruritus NRS will be assessed at time points according to the  
. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dermatology Life Quality Index 
The DLQI is a validated 10-item questionnaire designed to measure the impact of skin disease on 
the quality of life (QoL)  of an affected individual ( Finlay 1994). The format is a simple response 
to [ADDRESS_557575] week. For  each item, the scale is rated as follows: 
0 = “ not at all” ; 1 = “a little ”; 2 = “a lot”; 3 = “ very much,” with an overall scoring system of 
0 to 30; a high score is indicative of a poor QoL. For general inflammatory skin conditions a 
change in DLQI score of  at least 4 points is considered clinically important ( Basra 2015). 
The DLQI will be assessed at  time points  according to the  
. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient Global Assessment  of Disease  
Two questions will be included for subjects to rate their disease and their disease severity. 
Subjects  will rate their overall well- being based on a 5 -point Likert scale from poor to excellent . 
Subjects  will be asked , “Considering all the ways in which your eczema affects you, indicate 
how well you are doing.” Response choices are: ‘Poor’, ‘ Fair’, ‘Good’, ‘ Very Good ,’ or 
‘Excellent’ . 
Subjects will also be asked to best describe the overall appearance of skin lesions at a given time 
point using the vIGA scale (Section  10.3.3). The vIGA scale has been adapted for patients to 
complete. The scale has been modified for easier understanding for subjects, to exclude medical terminology (eg, lichenification has been adapted to thickening and erythema to redness). 
Subjects  will complete  these assessment s at time points according to  the  
. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient Oriented Eczema Measure  
The Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) is a patient -derived validated tool used for 
monitoring atopic eczema severity. The POEM consists of [ADDRESS_557576] experienced specific AD -related symptoms   
(UON 2004 , Charman 2013).

Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 62 of 102 10.5.8. Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Adverse Event  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal prod uct. 
AEs can include, but are not limited to, any of the following: 
• Unfavorable changes in general condition  
• Subjective or objective signs/symptoms 
• Concomitant disease or accidents  
• Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters over the course of the study 
• Pre-existing conditions that worsen in severity, increase in frequency, or have new 
signs/symptoms  
Information on the grading and management of laboratory abnormalities according to assessment 
severity is provided in Appendix 2 and Appendix 3, respectively . 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE  should be classified as a serious adverse event ( SAE ) if it meets 1 of the following 
criteria:  
Fatal:  The AE resulted in death.  
Life-threatening: The AE placed the subject at immediate risk of death. This 
classification does not apply to an AE  that hypothetically might cause 
death if it were more severe.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  The AE required or prolonged an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_439811]-ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_13748] . 
Disabling/ incapacitating:  The AE resulted in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
Congenital anomaly or birth defect: An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject exposed to the study treatment before conception or during pregnancy. 
Medicall y significant: The AE did not meet any of the above criteria but could have 
jeopardized the subject and might have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. 
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334- 201 
Etrasimod Versus Placebo in Subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (ADVISE)  Amendment 1.0  
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 63 of 102 [IP_ADDRESS].3. Adverse Drug Reaction  
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) in the pre- approval clinical experience with a new medicinal 
product or its new usages, particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, is any 
noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product related to any dose. The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE  is at least a reasonable possibility (ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out). 
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Events of Interest  
Based on the mechanism of act ion of  etrasimod  and prior experience with other agents acting via 
a similar mechanism, as well as known comorbid conditions with AD, potential events of interest 
may be identified. In addition to appropriate reporting of these events as an AE  or an SAE, 
supplementary detailed information may be collected. 
[IP_ADDRESS].5. Severity  
The severity of each AE will be assessed at the onset by a nurse/or physician. When recording 
the outcome of the AE , the maximum severity of the AE experienced will also be recorded. The 
severity of each AE will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events: 
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling, limiting self -care activities of daily living  (eg, preparing meals, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money). 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5  Death related to an AE . 
Additional information on CTCAE grading of AEs is provided in Appendix 2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].6. Relationship  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the stud y treatment and each 
occurrence of each AE. The AE  relationship to study treatment must be characterized as 1 of the 
following categories:  
Not Related : 
The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug, does not abate upon discontinuation of the drug, does not follow a known or hypothesized cause- effect 
relationship, and (if applicable) does not reappear when the drug is 
reintroduced, furthermore, there may exist a clear altern ative medical 
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334- 201 
Etrasimod Versus Placebo in Subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (ADVISE)  Amendment 1.0  
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 64 of 102 explanation (e.g., underlying disease state) or association with study 
procedure or study conduct.  
Unlikely Related : The temporal association between the AE and the drug is such that the 
drug is not likely to have any reasonable association  with the AE.  
Probably Related:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause-effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reapp ears 
when the drug is reintroduced.  
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, 
such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the 
temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment administration should be considered and investigated. The investigator should consult the IB and the Product Information of marketed 
products within the drug class, when applicable. For each AE, the investigator must document in 
the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor; however, the investigator should 
always make an initial assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE to the Sponsor. The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_439812]-up report with the updated causality 
assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Eliciting , Recording , and Reporting Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Eliciting Adverse Events  
Subjects will be instructed that they may report AEs at any time. An open -ended or nondirected 
method of questioning should be used at each study visit to elicit the reporting of AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Recording Adverse Events  
The AE reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject is initially included in 
the study (date of first signature [CONTACT_43998]) and continues up to [ADDRESS_557578] questioning, discovered during physical 
Clinical Study Protocol  APD334- 201 
Etrasimod Versus Placebo in Subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (ADVISE)  Amendment 1.0  
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 65 of 102 examination, laboratory testing, and/or other means by [CONTACT_439827], as appropriate. The following information should be recorded on the AE  eCRF:  
• Description including onset and resolution dates 
• Whether it met SAE criteria  
• Severity  
• Relationship to study treatment or other causality 
• Outcome 
For SAEs, events occurring secondary to the primary event should be described on the eCRF in 
the narrative description field.  
The following should be considered when recording SAEs: 
• Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in the death should be 
recorded and reported  on the eCRF.  
• For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], surgical, or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure itself. The procedure should be captured in the narrative as part of the action taken in response to the illness. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Diagnosis Versus Signs or Symptoms 
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listing out of individual symptoms. 
Groupi[INVESTIGATOR_44971] a diagnosis should only be done if each component sign and/or 
symptom is a medically confirmed component of a diagnosis as evidenced by [CONTACT_45033]. If any aspect of a sign or symptom does not fit into a classic pattern of the diagnosis, report the individual symptom as a separate AE . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs are subject to reporting requirements. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, whether or not considered related to study treatment, must be reported to the Sponsor 
Contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24  hours of becoming aware of the event.  Enter the S AE information on the 
eCRF, and send other available pertinent information (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory results) to 
the designated Sponsor contact:  
[CONTACT_439828]-up information is required or becomes available for a previously reported SAE, entry of the new information on the eCRF should be completed within 24  hours of 
awareness.  

Clinical Study Protocol  APD334- 201 
Etrasimod Versus Placebo in Subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (ADVISE)  Amendment 1.0  
Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 66 of 102 Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or surgery for clearly preexisting c onditions (eg, a surgery that has 
been scheduled prior to the subject’s entry into the study) will not be reported as an SAE. All 
other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], including elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155793], will be reported as an  SAE.  
Any SAE that is ongoing when the subject completes the study or discontinues the study will be followed by [CONTACT_439829] , stabilize s or return s to baseline status.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Serious, Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions  
All ADRs that a re both serious and unexpected are subject to expedited reporting to regulatory 
agencies. An unexpected ADR is one for which the nature or severity is not consistent with information in the relevant source documents. 
The following documents or circumstances will be used to determine whether an AE /ADR is 
expected:  
1. For a medicinal product not yet approved for marketing in a country, the RSI of the 
company’s IB will serve as the source document in that country. 
2. Reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already documented serious ADR constitute unexpected events. For example, an event more specific or more severe than described in the RSI of the IB would be considered 
“unexpected .” 
10.5.9. Preg nancy  
If at any point any pregnancy test is confirmed positive, the subject will be withdrawn from the 
study treatment. 
Details of all pregnancies in female subjects and female partners of male subjects will be collected after the start of study treatment and until [ADDRESS_557579] dose.  
Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to study treatment) does not meet the definition 
of an AE ; however, to fulfill regulatory requirements, any pregnancy and/or pregnancy outcome 
should be reported via the  Pregnancy Report Form to the designated Sponsor C ontact  within 
24 hours of awareness.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and should be reported as such even if outside the SAE reporting period. 
10.6. Procedures for Overdose  
See the IB for additional information . 
There is no established overdose threshold for this clinical stud y, nor is t here any  recommended 
specific treatment for an overdose but to  provide supportive care if clinically indicated. 
In the event of a suspected overdose, the investigator and/or treating physician should: 
1. Closely monitor the subject for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities and provide supportive care.

Etrasimod Versus Placebo in Subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (ADVISE)  Amendment 1.[ADDRESS_557580] 
deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized 
using frequency counts and percentages. 
11.2. Determinatio n of Sample Size  
It is assumed that the percent change in EASI from Baseline to Week  12 will be normally 
distributed with a SD  of 41%. Assuming a 1:1:1 randomization, 120 subjects (40 subjects each in 
1 mg etrasimod, 2  mg e trasimod, or placebo  groups ) is sufficient to achieve at least 90% power 
to detect a difference of 35% in EASI from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_557581] using a 1 -sided significance level of 0.025 
with estimated S D at 41%. This sample size also accounts for an estimated drop -out rate up to 
25%.  
11.3. Analysis Sets 
For purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets are defined ( Table 7).  
Table 7: Analys is Sets  
Analysis Set  Description  
Full Analysis Set (FAS)  The FAS includes all randomized subjects, irrespective of whether 
they received any study tr eatment . 
Modified Full Analysis Set 
(mFAS)  The mFAS population consists of all randomized subjects who 
received at least [ADDRESS_557582] study treatment , 
missing more than a defined number of visits while still on study ,

mFAS set , data will be set to missing after rescue medication uses; all missing data 
will be imputed using post- baseline worst -case-carry -forward method. 
• Proportion of s ubjects achieved EASI -75 response at Week 12 will be analyzed in the 
mFAS set  using EASI scores imputed by [CONTACT_439830] 11.4.1. 
• Observed data analyses  in mFAS set , regardless of rescue medication uses and 
without missing data imputation: 
− For longitudinal continuous variables  (eg, percentage of change in EASI  from 
Baseline to Week 12), mixed effects model  with repeated measures ( MMRM) 
analysis will be performed  and by [CONTACT_439831]; 
− For longitudinal dichotomous measures ( eg, EASI -75, vIGA  0 to 1), logistic 
regression analysis will be performed  by [CONTACT_765].  
• Completers analyses of primary and secondary endpoints for subjects who complete 
12 weeks of study treatment.  
• Analyses of primary and key secondary endpoints in the Per Protocol set . 
11.5. Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint of percentage change in EASI from Baseline to Week  12 will be analyzed 
in the FAS and using MI procedure with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The 
ANCOVA model will include treatment group as factor, Baseline EASI  score and randomization 
factor as covariates . Multiple results of ANCOVA (least square [ LS] means  and LS mean 
difference from placebo) for each MI dataset will be analyzed and reported along with 95% 
confidence interval (CI)  and p-value using Rubin’s meth od ( ). 
Proportion- based key secondary endpoints (eg, EASI-75, vIGA 0  to 1) at Week  12 will be 
analyzed in the FAS using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel method adjusted for randomization 
stratification factor.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving the goal and the difference 
in proportion between treatment groups achieving the goal, along with p-value and the 95% CIs 
will be reported. 
Other secondary endpoints (list ed in Section  11.5.4) will be analyzed using the following 
methods in general and specific details will be discussed in the SAP. 
• Longitudinal continuous variables measured at scheduled visits up to Week  12 will be 
analyzed using a MMRM model. The MMRM model will include treatment group, 
visit, and interaction of treatment- by-visit as factors, and baseline measure and 
randomization stratification factor as covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix 
will be specified for  the MMRM model. LS means at visit and LS mean differences 
between treatment group with p-values and corresponding 95% CIs will be reported. This method will also b e applied to other score based or continuous measures. 
• Longitudinal dichotomous measures at scheduled visits will be analyzed using a logistic regression model. The model will include treatment group as a factor, Baseline EASI score  and randomization strat ification factor  as covariates. The odds 
ratios and 95% CIs, and associated p- value will be reported.

In addition to between group analyses on the primary and secondary endpoints, dose response of 
key efficacy measures for the 2 etrasimod doses and placebo will be assessed as exploratory 
using appropriate analysis models, which will be specified in the SAP. 
Efficacy data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_29673], while safety data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_29628].  
11.5.1. Endpoint Definitions  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_439832], vIGA, SCORAD, and BSA. 
Symptoms of itch will be assessed using the prurit us NRS.  Patient -reported outcomes will also  
be assessed using the DLQI , POEM , and PGA. 
The following definitions will be used to assess efficacy outcomes:  
11.5.2. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
• Percent change in EASI from Baseline to Week  12. 
11.5.3. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
• Proportion of subjects achieving EASI-75, defined as a 75% reduction of EASI from 
Baseline to Week  12. 
• Proportion of subjects with a vIGA 0  to 1 (on a 5-point scale) score and a reduction 
from Baseline of ≥ 2 points at Week  12. 
11.5.4. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• Percent change in peak pruritus NRS  from an itch dail y diary from Baseline to 
Week  12. 
• Proportion of subjects with improvement (reduction) in peak pruritus NRS ≥ 3 from 
an itch daily diary from Baseline to Week  12. 
• Proportion of subjects achieving EASI-50, defined as a ≥ 50% reduction of EASI from Baseline to Week  12. 
• Proportion of subjects achieving EASI-90, defined as a ≥ 90% reduction of EASI from Baseline to Week  12.

Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  Page 74 of 102 11.7. Interim Analysis  
No formal interim analysis of efficacy is planned. Periodic blinded assessments of the 
assumption regarding the SD of the percentage change in EASI from Baseline to Week 12 may 
be conducted. The planned sample size will not be reduced as a result of the SD assessments.  
11.8. Safety Analyses  
A detailed description of all safety analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
11.8.1. Safety Endpoints  
•Incidence and severity of AEs.
•Incidence and severity of laboratory abnormalities and change from Baseline in
laboratory values (to include hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and
urinalysis).
•Incidence of clinically significant vital sign abnormalities and changes from Baseline.
May include  post- first-dose.
•ECGs .
•Physical examination  findings.
11.8.2. Adverse Events  
All AEs  will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities . 
For each treatment group, the proportion of subjects with treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs)  will 
be summarized overall, by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_78487] . SAEs will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. A TEAE is defined as:  
•An AE  that occurs after initiation of study treatment that was not present at the time
of treatment start.
•An AE  that increases in severity after the initiation of study treatment, if the event
was present at the time of treatment start.
Any AE  occurring before the first dose of study treatment will be summarized separately.  
11.8.3. Extent of Exposure 
The duration of time on study and time on study treatment will be summarized for each treatment using descriptive statistics. The number of subjects on study treatment for certain time intervals 
will also be summarized. The total subject-years and total subject-years on study wi ll also be 
included in this summary. 
11.8.4. Clinical Laboratory Parameters  
Laboratory parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_439833].  Associated laboratory parameters such as hepatic 
enzymes, renal function, and hematology values will be grouped and presented together.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Ocrelizumab  (OCR) , a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and 
destroys CD2 0-expressing lymphocytes  (B-cell lymphocytes), has demonstrated robust 
efficacy in reducing relapse rate, sustained disability worsening, and MRI indicators of 
disease activity in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS)1. For patients with 
primary progressive MS (PPMS), OCR  demonstrated reduction in disability progression 
compared to patients receiving the placebo treatment2. The medication is well -tolerated 
with upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_866181] -related reactions  (IRRs) . At least one infusion reaction oc curred in 34.3% of 
the p atients in OPERA I and OPERA II1. The majority of the infusion reactions were 
mild to moderate and occurred with the first infusion of dose  1. In the clinical tria ls, all 
patients were pre -medicated with 100mg of methylprednisolone, and per the protocol , 
an analgesic/antipyretic such as acetaminophen and an IV or oral antihistamine such as 
diphenhydramine 50mg were recommended to use prior to  starting OCR  to minimiz e 
IRRs . However, drowsiness is commonly associated with diphenhydramine; therefore, a 
newer antihistamine such as cetirizine m ay be tolerated better without an increase in 
IRRs . 
 
2. OBJECTIVES  
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
The primary objec tive of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_866182] -inferior to diphenhydramine in limiting the proportion and severity 
of reactions  from OCR infusion s. 
 
2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE  
The secondary objective of this stud y is to evaluate patient  treatment satisfaction after 
receiving cetirizine and diphenhydramine  as premedication for OCR infusion s. 
 
3.     STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY  
This 6 -month randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_866183] e 
evidence that cetirizi ne is better tolerated than diphenhydramine without an increase in 
IRRs . Fifty -two patients, 26 patients per arm, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
cetirizine or diphenhydramine as premedication prior to OCR  infusions on day 0 (1st 
half dose  of 300mg ), day 14 (2nd half dose  of 300mg ) and week 24 ( 1st full dose  of 
600mg ). Neuro logical exam s and the estimated Expanded Disability Status Scale 
(EDSS ) will be obtained at screening and week [ADDRESS_1208543] Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (SSS), and the Visual Analog Scale – 
Fatigue (VAS-F) will be administered at screening, baseline, day 14, and week 24. 
Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS -29) 
will b e administered at screen ing and week 24 . MSIS -29 and MFIS will also be 
administered at premature termination, if applicable. Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM)  will be administered at baseline, day 14, and 
week 24. TSQM , SSS, and VA S-F will be administered  within [ADDRESS_1208544] and assess infusion reactions or other AEs.  
 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page [ADDRESS_1208545] decreased the dose of diphenhydramine to 25mg 
administered either IV or orally which has resulted in less , but still marked , drowsiness. 
Newer antihis tamines such as cetirizine may be better tolerated ; however, there is no 
evidence that they will be as effective in minimizing infusion reactions.  
 
3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES  
 
3.3.1  Primary Outcome Measure  
The proportion of patients having an  infusion -related reacti on, as defined by [CONTACT_866198] (CTCAE) , version [ADDRESS_1208546] full 600mg dose infusion on week 24 . 
 
TSQM (Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication) score aft er the infusions 
on day 0, day 14, and week 24 . 
 
SSS (Stanford Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110]) score after the infusions on day 0, day 14, and week 
24. 
 
VAS-F (Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue) score after the infusions on day 0, day 14, and 
week 24.  
 
MFIS (Modified Fati gue Impact Scale) score at week 24 .  
 
Physical and psychological MSIS -29 (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale) scores at week 
24. 
 
3.4 SAFETY PLAN  
Patients will be evaluated by a clinician at the start of the study  and at week 24  prior to 
the 600mg OCR  infusion . Phone visits will be cond ucted after each infusion (see 
Section 4.5 , Study Assessment s, and Appendix A, Study Flowchart).  
A full neurologic al examination will be conducted at screening  and week 24 . Any 
worsening or new abnormality (including laboratory resu lts) that is determined by [CONTACT_866199]. MS related symptoms are not to be reported as AEs unless, 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 5 of 33  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the sympt oms are unusually seriou s and relevant.  
 
The recommendation from the OCR prescribing information dated 12/[ZIP_CODE] is to pre -
medicate with  100mg of methylprednisolone  (or an equivalent corticosteroid) 
administered 30 minutes prior to each OCR  infusion to reduce the frequency and 
severity of infusion -related reactions (IRRs)  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) in 
prescribing information4].  
 
For this study, all patients will receive 1,000mg of acetaminophen orally and 100mg of 
methylprednisolone via IV 30-60 minutes prior to each infusion.  Additionally, pat ients 
will be randomized  to receive e ither diphenhydramine 25mg orally or cetirizine  10mg 
orally  30-60 minutes prior to each OCR  infusion  to further reduce the frequency and 
severity of infusion reactions .  
 
Recommended m edications to be available if there  is an infusion reaction  (per treating 
investigator discretion) : 
A. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] – anaphylaxis  
B. Albuterol – bronchospasm or hypoxia  
C. Famotidine 20mg IV – hives, itching, or anaphylaxis  
D. Oxygen therapy – shortness of breath, chest pain, or hypoxia  
E. Acetaminophen – pain, fever, and headach es 
F. Methylprednisolone – hives, itching, shortness of breath, or anaphylaxis  
 
Suggested Management of IRRs  
 
All CD20+ depleting agents administered via the intravenous route, including OCR, 
have been associated with acute IRRs. Sympt oms of IRRs may occur du ring any 
ocrelizumab infusion, but have been more frequently reported during the first infusion. 
Physicians should alert patients that IRRs can occur within [ADDRESS_1208547] resolved. The initial infusion rate at restart should be half of the infusion 
rate at the time of onset of  the reaction.  
 
Mild-Moderate IRRs  
If the event that a patient experiences is a mild to moderate IRR (e.g. headache), the 
infusion rate should be reduced to half the rate at the time of the event. This reduced

Page [ADDRESS_1208548] 30 minu tes. If tolerated, the infusion rate may 
then be increased according to the patient’s initial infusion schedule.

Randomization will be based on a computer -generated sequence using a permuted 
block  design with block  size equal to four . Participants will be allocated in a 1:[ADDRESS_1208552] been completed.  The premedication  and OCR  will be pai d for by [CONTACT_866200]’s insurance. Patients may receive any generic product s of 
cetirizine or diphenhydramine  that are available at their infusion center and d o not 
require the same  brand of the prem edication for their subsequent infusions .  The same 
brand does not need to be used at each OCR infusion, per patient.

4.[ADDRESS_1208560] of the Study  
For the prim ary, non -inferiority endpoint, analysis will be on both the intention -to-treat 
and per -protocol populations  (two-sample prop ortion non -inferiority test) . Analysis for 
secondary endpoints wil l be on the intention -to-treat population. The intention -to-treat 
population is defined as all randomized patients, and the per -protocol population will be 
those who completed the study as p er protocol specification.  
 
If the study is termi nated before planned enrollment is reached , only descriptive 
analy sis will be performed .  
 
4.9.[ADDRESS_1208561] infusion on day 0 will be 
reported for each arm. Cetirizine will be considered non -inferior to diphenhydramine if 
the lower  limit of the two-sided, 90% confidence interval for the difference in proportions 
(diphenhydrami ne-cetirizine) is greater than the non -inferiority margin of -0.305.  
 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 12 of 33  b. Secondary Endpoints  
The proportion of patients with IRRs during or  after infusion  will be compared using 
Fisher’s exact tests  at day  [ADDRESS_1208562] the proportion of IRRs to be 
small at these time points based on OPERA I and II . Additionally, the proportion of IRRs 
after each infusion will be plotted overal l and by [CONTACT_866201]. At day 0, day 
14, and week 24,  TSQM scores will be compared between arms using Wilcoxon Rank 
Sum or two -sample t -tests, as appropriate based on normality , and SSS and VA S-F 
scores will be compared  using Wilcoxon rank sum  tests . MFIS, physical MSIS -29, and 
psychological MSIS -29 will be compared at week 24  using multiple linear regression 
with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for the screening score.  
 
4.9.[ADDRESS_1208563]/worst imputation will be 
used, assum ing missing at random. For the  primary endpoint , assessed at day [ADDRESS_1208564] missing data will be limited.   
 
4.9.6  Determination of Sample Size  
Based on the results of the OPERA I and II trials, we assume that 25% of patients in the 
diphenhydramine arm  and 25% of patients in the cetirizine arm  will experience mild to 
severe IRRs during or after receiving the first infusion on day 0. Assuming that a 30% 
absolute  difference  (i.e. margin = - 0.30) in the proportion of patients with IRR s between 
premedication groups is the maximum relevant differen ce when holding that cetiri zine is 
not inferior to diphenhydramine, 26 patients per arm are needed to achieve 80% power 
with a one-sided significance level  of 0.[ADDRESS_1208565] 
practices and procedures.   
 
5. REPORTING OF ADVERSE EV ENTS   
At the time of consenting, each patient will be given the names and telephone number s 
of the study personnel for reporting AE’s.  The investigator must conduct thorough 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page [ADDRESS_1208566] review the laboratory findings for 
significance (all out of range values must be assessed as clinically significant or not 
clinically significant) and s ign and date the laboratory report.  All clinically significant 
laboratory findings must be reported as adverse events. MS related symptoms are not 
to be reported as AEs unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the symptoms are 
unusually serious and rele vant. Any AE of severity moderate or hi gher, requires follow 
up until resolution or stabilization  by [CONTACT_866202] . 
 
All AEs should be recorded in the patient’s AE case report form regardl ess of severity 
or relationship to the premedication  or OC R.  
 
Infusion -Related Reactions (IRRs)  
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after OCR  administration and are 
judged to be related to OCR  infusion should be captured as a diagnosis (e. g., “infusion -
related reaction” or “ana phylactic reaction” ) on the Adverse Event eCRF. If possible, 
avoid ambiguous terms such as “systemic reaction.” Associated signs and symptoms 
should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF. If a pa tient 
experiences both a local and syst emic reaction to th e same dose of OCR , each reaction 
should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms 
also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF.  
 
Investig ators should consider a local IRR for a ny symptoms affecti ng the skin and 
localized to only one place. Any other IRR should be considered systemic.  
 
Severity  
The adverse event severity gradi ng scale for the NCI CTCAE (v5.0 ) will be used for 
assessing adver se event severity.  The b elow table should be used for ass essing 
severity for adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

patient . 
 
Unlikely  Any event that does not follow a reasonable tempo ral sequence from  
administration of drug OR that is likely to have been produced by [CONTACT_4677] ’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the 
patient . 
 
Possibly  Any reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration o f drug OR that fo llows a known response pattern to the 
suspected drug AND  that could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_10262] ’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy administered to t he patient . 
 
Related  Any reaction that follows a reasona ble temporal sequence from

Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page [ADDRESS_1208568] of monitoring and reporting adverse events ( AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related to  the premedication  or 
OCR , per protoco l. This includes  all events of death, a nd any study s pecific issue of 
concern.  
Adverse Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of the premedication , OCR,  or other protocol -imposed 
interven tion, whether or not there is a causal relationship w ith OCR  or the 
premedication . 
 
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the patient  that emerge during the protocol -specified 
AE reporting period.  
 
• Complications that occur as a result  of protocol -mandated interventions (e. g., 
procedure s such as OCR infusions) . 
 
 
• If applicable, A Es that occur after signing consent, prior to assignment of study 
treatment associated with medication washout, no treatment run -in, or other protocol -
mandated i ntervention.  
 
• Preexisting medical cond itions (othe r than the condition being studied) judged by 
[CONTACT_188211] -specified AE reporting period.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if any of the following criteria are met:  
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e.,  the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient  at immediate risk of  death. It does not include an AE tha t, had it oc curred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.).  
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient ’s ability t o conduct no rmal life functions).  
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a 
mother  exposed to the premedication  and/or OCR.  
• It is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_866203] (e.g. , may jeopar dize the patient  or may require medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).  
 
 
5.2  METHODS AND TIMING FOR ASSESSING AND RECORDING SAFETY VARIABLES  
 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 16 of 33  The investigator is respons ible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or 
reported during the study, are collected and reported to the FDA (as applicable) , 
appropriate IRB(s)  (as applicable) , and Genentech, Inc. , in accordance with CFR 
312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
Adve rse Event Reporting Period  
The study period d uring which all AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after 
informed consent is obtained and ends [ADDRESS_1208569] administration of 
study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is ea rlier. After this 
period, investigato rs should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study 
treatment.  
Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by [CONTACT_102] , discovered by [CONTACT_13661], or detected th rough examination, laboratory test, o r other means 
will be reported appropriately. Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_14215] (i.e.,  start and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, 
suspected relationship to OCR  (see abov e guidance)  and premedication , and ac tions 
taken.  
 
Expected versus unexpected is to be evaluated for SAEs.  
 
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in 
the current prescribing information4.  
 
Unexpected adverse  events are those not listed in the prescribing information4 or not 
identified. This includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not 
consistent with the description in the prescribing information.  For example, under this 
definition , hepatic necrosis would be unexpecte d if the prescribing information  only 
referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.  
 
5.3  PRO CEDURES FOR ELICITING, RECORDING, AND  REPORTI NG ADVERSE 
EVENTS  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all patient  evaluation time  points should be 
adopted. Examples of non -directive questions include:  
• “How have you felt sin ce your last clinical visit?”  
• “Have you had a ny new /changed heal th problems since you were last here?”  
Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or 
SAEs. Avoid collo quialisms and abbreviations.  
a. Diagnosis vs.  Signs and Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual 
signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, 
asterixis, and elevated transaminases). Howe ver, if a conste llation of signs and/or 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 17 of 33  symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the 
time of reporting, it is ok to report the information that is currently available. If a 
diagnosis is su bsequently established, it sh ould be reported  as follow -up information.  
b. Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see Section 
5.1.2), regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parties. When 
recording a death, the event or c ondition that ca used or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be reported as the single medical concept. If the cause of death is unknown and 
cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.  
c. Pree xisting Medical Conditions  
A pre-existing med ical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such 
conditions should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical 
condition should be re -assessed throughout the trial and  reported as an AE or SAE onl y 
if the frequen cy, severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study. When 
reporting such events, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting 
condition has changed by [CONTACT_866204] (e.g.,  “more frequent 
headaches”).  
d. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164363]. If a patient  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical  
or surgical procedure as a r esult of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not 
the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE. For example, if a patient  is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15428], record the heart condition that 
necessitated the by[CONTACT_866205] S AE. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598231]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15430]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_866185]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51693].  
e. Pregnancy  
Female  patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to i mmediately 
inform the investi gator if they be come  pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_1208570] dose of OCR .  If a pregnancy occurs during this time period for a 
female patient , a report should be completed and submitted to Genentech, Inc. Fo llow-
up to obtain the outcome  of the pregnanc y should also occur , whenever  possible,  
based  upon  due diligence  taken  to obtain  the follow-up information . Abortion, whether 
accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, and 
expeditiously reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a 
child born to a female patient  exposed to the premedication s and/or OCR  should be 
reported as an SAE.  
 
Additional information on any ocrelizumab -exposed pregnancy and inf ant will be 
requested by [CONTACT_866206]/[COMPANY_002] Drug  Safety at specific time points (i.e. after having 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 18 of 33  received the initial report, at the end of the second trimester, 2 weeks after the expected 
date of delivery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months of the infant’s life).  
 
Pregnanc ies will not be repo rted to the prem edication  manufacture . 
f. Post -Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a patient  has 
completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior OCR  exposure. If the 
investigator sh ould become awar e of the development of cancer or a congenital 
anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient  who participated in 
the study, this should be reported as an SAE.  
 
SAEs will not be reported to th e premedication  manufacture a fter the end of the 
patient’s study participation.  
 
g.       Case Transmission Verification of Single Case Reports  
The Sponsor  agrees  to conduct the Case Transmission Verification to ensure that all 
single case reports have be en adequately received by [CONTACT_866207] , Inc.  via Providence 
Brain and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_866186] , Inc.  a quarterly line -listing documenting 
single case reports sent by [CONTACT_595762][INVESTIGATOR_866187] , Inc.  in 
the preceding time perio d.  
 
The periodic line -listing will be exchan ged within seven (7) calendar days of the end of 
the agreed time period. Confirmation of receipt should be received within the time 
period mutually agreed upon.  
                    
If discrepancies are identifie d, the Sponsor and Genentech , Inc. will coope rate in 
resolving the discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each party shall handle the 
matter on a case -by-case basis until satisfactory resolution.  The sponsor shall receive 
reconciliation guidance d ocuments within the ‘Activati on Package’.  
 
Following Case Transmission Verification, single case reports which have not been 
received by [CONTACT_8229] , Inc.  shall be forwarded by [CONTACT_595762][INVESTIGATOR_866188] , Inc.  within five (5) calendar days from request by [CONTACT_768700] h, 
Inc. 
 
At the end of the study, a final cumulative Case Transmission Verification  report will be 
sent to Genentech , Inc.  
 
Case Transmission Verification will not be completed for the premedication  
manufactures.  
 
h.  AEs of Special Interest (AESIs)  
AEs of Special Inter est are defined as a potential safety problem, identified as a result 
of safety monitoring of OCR. AESIs are not being reported for the premedication s.  
 
There are no ocrelizumab Events of Special Interest.  
 
 Adverse events of special int erest for this stu dy include the following:  
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 19 of 33  • Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST 
in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by

Any organism, viru s, or infectious p article (e.g., prion protein 
transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
non-pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of 
an infectious agent may be suspected from c linical symptoms or 
laborat ory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a 
medicinal product.  This term applies only when a contamination of the 
study drug is suspected .

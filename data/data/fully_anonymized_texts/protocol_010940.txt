Title A Phase II Study of Radiation Therapy and Vismodegib, for the Treatment of Locally 
Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck  
Patient 
population  Patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma in the head and neck, who are 
ineligible for surgical resection and are planned for definitive intent radiation therapy.  
Rationale for 
Study  Vismodegib is a proven effective means for treating locally a dvanced and metastatic 
BCC. Radiotherapy for advanced, unresectable BCC can be effective as well, but 
ultimate success rates can remain limited for complex, unresectable tumors, either due to anatomic or technical factors. Vismodegib alone produces high response rates in BCC but is unlikely to sustain permanent eradication of very advanced tumors. This study is designed to assess the safety and demonstrate the efficacy of a combined approach using radiation therapy after induction and concurrent systemic administration of vismodegib, which may increase the rates of complete response and sustained local control in patients with locally advanced BCC. This population was chosen for study based on unmet medical need and evidence of efficacy observed in earlier studies of vismodegib in advanced BCC. At this point in time, despi[INVESTIGATOR_633694], there is no guidance about how to integrate 
this treatment with other curative -intent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Primary 
Objective  To determine local -regional control rate at 12 months from protocol therapy 
completion, defined as complete or partial response, with absence of progressive disease within the irradiated planning tumor volumes  (PTV) for patients with locally 
advanced basal cell carcinoma in the  head and neck.  
Secondary 
Objectives  • To estimate of the probability of PFS , with failure defined as any disease 
recurrence or death due to any cause, and OS with the duration for each measured 
from the time of first treatment with vismodegib to 12 months after completion of 
study treatment.  
• To evaluate toxicity during the drug- alone and combined- modality components of 
the protocol regimen during treatment. This will be assessed by:  
1) The number and attribution of all adverse events, (including vital signs,  
physical findings, and clinical laboratory results, CTCAE, v 4. 0) in patients 
who receive any amount of study drug and radiation therapy.  
2) The proportion of any adverse events (CTCAE, v. 4. 0) assessed to be 
definitely, probably, or possibly related to vismodegib or its combination with radiation therapy.  
3) The proportion of patients experiencing Grade 4- 5 adverse events assessed 
to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to the induction or concurrent 
treatment components of the protocol regimen (that is  not definitely related to 
disease progression).  
• To evaluate initial toxicity during the 3 months immediately after completion of 
protocol therapy.  
• To estimate the feasibility of administering concurrent vismodegib with radiation 
therapy determined by [CONTACT_633723] 
(<75% of planned radiation therapy delivered).  
• To evaluate the response rate (as per RECIST  version 1.1) of the primary  site and 
regionally involved areas following all treatment components at 3 months after the completion of protocol therapy.  
• To estimate the clinical response to vismodegib and radiation therapy determined 
by [CONTACT_417949] a decrease of BCC within the irradiated planning tumor volumes (PTVs, see Section 5.0 for definition) in patients who complete 
combined therapy.

Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page [ADDRESS_846178] 75% of protocol -mandated radio therapy.   
Duration of 
Therapy  Patients will receive  treatment for approximately 21 weeks .  
Duration of 
Follow up Follow -up visits will occur at 3, 6, & 12 months  (+/- 2 weeks)  post End of Treatment 
visit.  Survival follow -up information may be collected via telephone calls and/or at 
clinic visits every 3 months for 12 months.  
Duration of 
study  The study will reach completion 3-4 years from the time the study opens to accrual.  
Study Drugs  Vismodegib capsules (150 mg QD PO ) will be taken orally (whole). Patients will be 
instructed to swallow one capsule once a day (preferably at the same time each day) 
7 days/week, with or without food, with about 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Capsules must be swallowed whole; they must not be opened, chewed, broken, or crushed under any 
circumstances.  
Safety 
Assessments  The study will use the CTCAE v 4. [ADDRESS_846179] 
of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related to vismodegib, all events of death, and any study specific issue of concern.  
The study period d uring which all AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after 
informed consent is obtained and initiation of study treatment and ends [ADDRESS_846180] administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier.  
Efficacy 
Assessments  Measurable lesions are those that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension as ≥20mm with CT or MRI scan or on color photographs.  Patients will undergo tumor assessments per RECIST  version 1.[ADDRESS_846181] that curative intent with radiation cannot be met. Furthermore, the total dose from all radiation delivered and expected to be delivered should not exceed the suggested dose constraints given for normal structures.  
To ensure a valid comparison of tumor data and uniformity in the assessment of tumor response and disease progression, the following procedures should be implemented: 
- The same local physician should perform all physical tumor assessment evaluations 
for an individual patient. Radiologic interpretation should be performed by [CONTACT_633724].  
- All lesions (target and non -target) identified at baseline will be reassessed according 
to the imaging schedule provided in Table 6- 1. The same method of evaluation (either 
CT scan or MRI), and/or color photography in the case of skin lesions, if feasible, 
must be used from baseline until the end of the study.

Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 10 of 74 1 Introduction 
1.1 Background on Indication 
1.1.1  Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma  
Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignancy in people; of the more than 1 
million cases of non- melanoma skin cancers reported in the [LOCATION_002] in 2007, 
approximately 80% are BCC (American Cancer Society 2007). Almost all of these cases ar e 
small BCCs that can be effectively treated by [CONTACT_633725]. However, in a subset of patients, invasion of the BCC into subcutaneous structures can occur. In some cases, this results from neglect of indolent BCCs, whereas in other cases, patients may develop particularly aggressive BCCs that recur and progress despi[INVESTIGATOR_633695]. If further surgical resection is not possible, there are many types of non- surgical 
treatment, although no one clear standard of care exists.  
Although radiation therapy may be used for either palliative or curative intent, its use may be limited by [CONTACT_633726]- sensitive structures, as well as prior 
interventions and/or cumulative radiation dosage. Locally advanced BCC (laBCC) can be associated with significant morbidity as the result of chronic pain, risk of bacterial infection and sepsis, bleeding/oozing, and compromise of function, resulting from invasion of structures such as the ear, nose, and eye. In some cases, invasion can progress to involve critical organs such as the meninges, brain, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], resulting in death (Cohen et al. 2000; Korvarik et al. 2005). In such cases, comprehensive radiation may become very technically challenging or pose risks to the patient’s function.  
Metastatic BCC (mBCC) is extremely rare. BCC has an overall reported metastasis rate ranging from .0 028% to 0.55%, but most believe the true metastasis rate to be significantly less than 
0.1% (Wadhera et al. 2006). A total of approximately [ADDRESS_846192] common sites of metastasis are the lymph nodes, lung, bone, liver, other viscera, and soft tissue (Snow et al. 1994). Once metastasis is detected, survival can be short for some patients, but a range of [ADDRESS_846193] been reported to live for as many as 25 years (von Domarus and Stevens 1984; Lo et al. 1991; Spates et al.2003). For treatment of distant metastasis, there is anecdotal use of chemotherapeutic agents such as platinum compounds (Pfeiffer et al. 1990). There is also vismodegib, an orally administered, systemically targeted agent recently approved for use in treatment -refractory BCC (Seku lic 2012).  
1.1.[ADDRESS_846194] surgical margin is applied (usually 4 mm or more), a high cure rate can be achieved. A weakness  of standard surgical excision is the high recurrence rate of BCC of the 
face, especially around eyelids, nose, and facial structures. On the face, or for recurrent BCC, surgical margins must be assured with controlled processing via complete circumferenti al 
peripheral and deep margin assessment.  
Most standard excisions are evaluated by a standard bread loafing method of processing. This method has a high "false negative" rate due to the random sampling of the tumor. It is likely that less than 5% of the surgical margin is examined, as each slice of tissue is only 6 micrometers thick, about 3 to 4 serial slices are obtained per section, and only about 3 to 4 sections are obtained per specimen. Usually, if a 4 mm free surgical margin is obtained around a smal l tumor 
(less than 6mm), or a wider 6 mm free surgical margin is obtained around a larger tumor (greater than 6mm), the cure rate is very high, at 95% or better. For cosmetic reasons, many doctors take only very small surgical margins 1– 2 mm especially when facial tumor is being 
removed. A pathology report from such a case indicating "margins free of residual tumor,” often is inaccurate, and there are recurrence rates of up to 38%.  
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 11 of 74 Mohs micrographic surgery (Mohs) is an outpatient procedure in which the tu mor is surgically 
excised and then immediately examined under a microscope. It has the highest cure rate of 
97% to 99.8% in some reports. The base and edges of the tumor are microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_633696]. If the margins are insufficient, more tissue is removed from the patient until the margins are sufficient.  
Extensive BCC that involves central facial structures, the base of skull, or specialized sensory organs requires oncologically oriented head and neck surgical resection with advance planning for reconstruction. If complete surgical removal of the tumor is not possible, there is no clear standard of care to treat these lesions. In these unresectable cases, radiotherapy, either for palliativ e or definitive intent, can play a major role in this setting. If treatment with radiotherapy is 
not possible due to surrounding radiation- sensitive organs or contraindicating medical 
conditions, treatment with vismodegib has recently been FDA -approved for  use. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_846195] (such as the anterior portions of the nose, nostril rims, lips, or eyelids). Longer and more extended fractionation schedules are associated with fewer long-
term complications to the normal tissue supporting the tumor.  
Radiotherapy is also delivered with curative intent if a surgical excision has been done incompletely or if the pathology report following surgery suggests a high risk of recurrence, such as if significant nerve involvement by [CONTACT_633727]. Some tumors are deemed unresectable at the outset and definitive radiotherapy is the only remaining standard option.  
Cure rates resulting from radiotherapy in this setting are difficult to  determine due to the 
historical heterogeneity of treatment approaches and the lengthy natural history of the disease.  However, certain prognostic factors are known to predispose for worse outcome, either due to bone invasion, gross perineural invasion, or adjacency or invasion of a critical anatomic structure, which limits the amount of radiotherapy dose that can be delivered to the tumor. The presence of bone or soft tissue invasion or gross perineural spread is associated with lower rates of success resulting from radiation therapy treatment. Cure rates can be low for extremely invasive tumors that are difficult to encompass properly with radiotherapy. Usually, invasive tumors that have recurred or remain persistent after radiation therapy are treated with surgery and/or vismodegib, and not with reirradiation.  
1.1.4  Basal Cell Carcinoma and Chemotherapy  
Some superficial BCC respond to local therapy with 5 -fluorouracil, a chemotherapy agent. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_8719] 5% Imiquimod cream, with five applications per week for six weeks, has a reported 70- 90% success rate at reducing, or even removing, the BCC. Both Imiquimod and 
5-fluorouracil have received FDA approval for the treatment of superficial BCC. Off -label use of 
imiquimod on invasive BCC has been reported. Neither of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_633697].  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_633698]. Some advocate the use of imiquimod prior to Mohs surgery to remove the superficial component of the cancer and reduce the size of the ultimate surgical defect required for removal of the cancer. These experimental procedures likely will result in better cure rate than one modality alone, but are not the standard of care.  
Locally advanced or deeply invasive BCC are not treated with chemotherapy and no real standard exists for the use of systemically administered agents in this setting, although vismodegib can be considered if other standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_633699].

Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page [ADDRESS_846196]  
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway presents a novel and potentially beneficial target for 
cancer therapy. Hh signaling regulates epi[INVESTIGATOR_633700] a variety of tissues during mammalian embryogenesis (Ingham and McMahon 2001). The Hh ligand in the extracellular space binds to Patched (PTCH1), a 12- pass transmembrane receptor on the 
surface of cells. Hh binding relieves the inhibitory effect of PTCH1 on Smoothened (SMO), a 7-pass transmembrane domain protein and a member of the G -protein coupled receptor 
superfamily. Signal transduction by [CONTACT_332495]1 transcription factors and induction of Hh target genes, many of which are involved in prolifera tion and survival, as well as angiogenesis.  
A role for aberrant Hh signaling in cancer was initially discovered in patients with Gorlin syndrome, a rare genetic disorder associated with predisposition to BCC, medulloblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. In thes e patients, mutations in the PTCH1 gene lead to ligand -independent 
activation of SMO and constitutive activity of the Hh pathway (Johnson et al. 1996). Recent molecular and genetic studies have demonstrated that the majority of sporadic human BCCs also have mutations in the Hh signaling pathway, resulting in aberrant activation of the pathway and uncontrolled proliferation of basal cells (Galilani et al. 1966; Aszterbaum et al. 1998). Two mutations commonly found in BCC result from either the inactivation of the PTCH1 receptor or the activation of SMO protein (Xie et al. 1998). Both have the same functional consequence, i.e., the uncontrolled activation of the Hh signaling pathway in the absence of the Hh protein. High levels of Hh target genes, such as GLI1  and PTCH1, are found in nearly all cases of 
human BCC examined (Dahmane et al. 1997; Unden et al. 1997), suggesting that activation of this pathway is a causal even in the initiation of tumor formation. These data suggest that blocking the Hh signaling pathway at the level or downstream of SMO may provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of BCC (Williams et al. 2003).  
The feasibility of blocking Hh signaling in vivo was first demonstrated as a result of teratogenic phenomena occurring in lambs with mothers that had ingested a particular forage plant, Veratrum californicum (Binns et al 1963). Cyclopamine, a steroid alkaloid isolated from this plant, was shown to induce midline deformities, including cyclopia, by [CONTACT_633728][INVESTIGATOR_633701] (Chen et al. 2002). Cyclopamine has proven to be valuable as a tool compound to confirm the importance of Hh signaling in a subset of malignancies, such as slowing the growth of pancreatic cancer xenografts and blocking the metastatic potent ial of 
prostate cancer cells in mice (Thayer et al. 2003; Karhadkar et al. 2004).

1.2.1  Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism (Safety)  
As part of a phase I trial for patients with any advanced or metastatic solid malignancy, 33 patients with metastatic or locally advanced BCC were randomized to receive oral vismodegib 150mg/day (17 patients), 270mg/day (15 patients), and 540mg/day (one patient). Pharmacokinetic data were obtained by a unique schedule of administration of the first dose at day 1, followed by a second dose at day 8 with daily dosing thereafter. Subsequent expansion cohorts included additional patients who received daily oral vismodegib at either 150mg/day or 270mg/day.

serum levels were the same in all three dose cohorts, indicating pharmacodynamic futility at  
doses higher than 150 mg/day on this schedule (Molckovsky J Hem Oncol 2008).  
Of the 33 patients with BCC, 19 had an objective response to vismodegib for an overall 
response rate of 58%. Two of these patients had a complete response, and 17 had a partial 
response. Of the remaining patients, only four had progression of disease, and 10 patients 
remained stable.  
Dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were not seen with vismodegib; prevalent adverse events 
included grade [ADDRESS_846198] been in patients with advanced 
BCC (Lorusso, Clinical Cancer Research 2011).  
1.2.[ADDRESS_846199] one allele of 
PTCH1, and an additional 10% have activating mutations in the downstream SMO protein.  
Results of a larger phase II trial offer additional positive evidence for the hedgehog inhibitor. The Erivance trial was an international, single- arm, multi -center, two- cohort, open- label study that 
enrolled 104 patients with advanced BCC, including locally advanced BCC (laBCC, n=71) and metastatic BCC (mBCC, n=33) (Sekulic 2012a). laBCC patients had lesions that were 
inappropriate for surgery and for which radiotherapy was unsuccessful or contraindicated. These patients were either deemed inoperable, or it was judged that surgery would resul t in 
substantial deformity. mBCC was defined as BCC that had spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, lung, bones and/or internal organs. Subjects received [ADDRESS_846200] independent review. Based on the secondary endpoint of clinical study investigators’ assessments, the overall response rate for laBCC was 60 percent and for mBCC, it was 46 percent. The median duration of progression- free survival by 
[CONTACT_171327] 9.5 months for both metastatic and locally advanced BCC patients and 11.3 months by [CONTACT_431]’ assessments.  
In [ADDRESS_846201] common adverse events included muscle spasms, hair loss, altered taste sensation, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite and diarrhea. Serious adverse events were reported in 26 patients (25 percent), but these were considered after review to be related to vismodegib in only four subjects (four percent). Although fatal events were reported over the course of the study in seven patients (seven per  
cent), none were considered by [CONTACT_633729]. These events included death from an unknown cause (in 3 patients) and hypovolemic shock, myocardial infarction, meningeal disease, and ischemic stroke (in 1 patient each). A review of these events suggested no definite pattern, and these [ADDRESS_846202] likely related to the presumed causes of death (Sekulic 2012b).

Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page [ADDRESS_846203] on stromal and 
endothelial components of tumor. This resistance mechanism , which has been observed in 
parallel to upregulation of PTCH1 and GLI1,  has been implicated in adenocarcinoma models of 
pancreas and colon cancer (Yauch 2008), as well as in radiation resistance of hepatocellular 
carcin oma cells (Chen 2011). GLI1 has been implicated independently in impairment of 
radiation- induced checkpoint activation (Leonard 2008). In non-small cell lung cancer, a recent 
study demonstrated a lack of radiation sensitization for in vitro cultures but did show radiation sensitization by [CONTACT_633730], indicating the influe nce of a paracrine effect ; this effect 
was confirmed by [CONTACT_633731]1 in mouse stromal cells  by 
[CONTACT_633732] (Zeng 2012). Hh signaling has also been implicated in human tumor survival 
following chemoradiation therapy for  esophageal cancers. One study found upregulated PTCH1 
expression in xenografts and residual tumors after chemoradiation, and additional clonogenic 
assays demonstrated increased radiosensitization with Hh inhibition ( Sims -Mourtada 2006). A 
second esophageal cancer study found that expression of PTCH1 and GLI1 predicted for a lack 
of complete pathologic response (Ajani 2011 ). Thus, there is growing interest in the possibility of 
a synergistic effect that might be achieved from the combination of radiation therapy with paracrine- mediated stromal effects of Hh antagonist.  
The advanced BCC  population was chosen for study based on unmet medical need and 
evidence of efficacy observed in earlier studies of vismodegib in advanced BCC. At this point in time, despi[INVESTIGATOR_633694], there is no guidance about how to integrate this treatment with other curative- intent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

3 Study  Design  
3.1 Characteristics  
This is a single arm , multi -centered  Phase II clinical trial to assess the safety and demonstrate 
the efficacy of a combined approach using radiation therapy after induction and concurrent ly 
with systemic administration of vismodegib, which may increase the rates of complete response 
and sustained local control in patients with locally advanced BCC.  
3.2 Number  of Subjects  
Required Sample Size: [ADDRESS_846204] 75% of protocol -mandated 
radiotherapy. Patients who withdraw c onsent , drop out of the study before starting radiation 
therapy  or before completing 75% of protocol  treatment without grade ≥[ADDRESS_846205] one histolo gically or cytologically confirmed lesion ≥ [ADDRESS_846206] medical contraindications to receipt of radiation therapy.  
If a patient has distant metastatic spread of BCC (e.g., spread to distant areas outside the regional lymph nodes, clearly non contiguous areas of bone involvement, or distant metastasis to lung, brain, or other visceral organs), the patient should be considered as having distant metastasis and is not eligible.  
Note: All lesions that the investigator proposes to follow as target lesions during the course of the study must have previously been histologically confirmed as BCC.  
Acceptable contraindications to surgery include:  
o BCC that has recurred in the same location after two or more surgical procedures 
and successful curative resection is deemed unlikely  
o Complete surgical resection is not possible or is deemed excessively morbid 
(e.g. invasion into cranial nerves or skull base, proximity to brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_158470] , or 
orbit) 
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 17 of 74 o Anticipated substantial morbidity and/or major deformity from surgery (e.g. 
removal of a major facial structure, such as nose, ear, eyelid, eye, o r jaw ; or 
requirement for upper limb amputation)  
o Medical contraindication to surgery  
o Patient refusal of surgery due to anticipated morbidity  
o Other conditions considered to be contraindicating must be discussed with Data 
Coordinator before enrolling the pat ient.

3.6.1  Primary Completion  
It is estimated that study accrual will be completed within 12-18 months  of the time at which the 
study is opened for enrollment.  It is estimated that primary outcome measure will be 
determined approximately 3 years  after the study is o pened for enrollment .   
Study Completion 
It is estimated that study completion will occur  within 3-4 years  of the time from when the study 
is open for enrollment.  
4 Study Drugs  
4.1 Description, Supply and Storage of Investigational Drugs  
4.1.1  Vismodegib  
Vismodegib capsules will be taken orally (whole). Patients receive vismodegib on an outpatient 
basis. Patients are instructed to swallow one capsule once a day (preferably at the same time 
each day) 7 days/week, with or without food, with about 1 cup (240 mL) of water.  Capsules must 
be swallowed whole; they must not be opened, chewed, broken, or crushed under any circumstances. It is preferable that vismodegib be taken prior to radiation therapy throughout the treatment course.  If a patient misses a dose (e.g., due to emesis), he or she should be instructed not to take or make up that dose and to resume dosing with the next scheduled dose. Missed doses will not be made up.  
Patients will be asked to document daily vismodegib on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_633703]- radiation 
treatmen t and concurrent treatment, which will be collected by [CONTACT_633736]. Institutions will submit a (DP) form at the end of both induction treatment  and 
concurrent treatment.  
Classification  
Inhibitor of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway  
Mechanism of Action  
Vismodegib is a more potent novel and specific synthetic oral hedgehog pathway inhibitor with an IC50 of [ADDRESS_846213], blocking the activities of the Hedgehog -ligand cell surface receptors PTCH and/or SMO and suppressing Hedgehog 
signaling. The Hedgehog signaling pathway plays an important role in tissue growth and repair; aberrant constitutive activation of Hedgehog pathway signaling and uncontrolled cellular proliferation may be associated with mutations in the Hedgehog -ligand cell surface receptors 
PTCH and SMO. Vismodegib also inhibits ABCG2, Pgp, and MRP1- important ABC transporters 
associated with multidrug resistance.  
Metabolism  
Greater than 98% of the total circulating drug- related components are the parent drug. 
Metabolic pathways of vismodegib in humans include oxidation, glucuronidation, and pyridine ring cleavage. The two most abundant oxidative metabolites recovered in feces are produced 
in 
vitro by [CONTACT_633737]2C9 and CYP3A4/5.  
Contraindications  
None per product insert.   
Availability  
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 21 of 74 Each vismodegib capsule has a pi[INVESTIGATOR_440576] a grey opaque cap with “150 mg” printed 
on the capsule body and “VISMO” printed on the capsule cap in black ink. Vismodegib capsules are available in bottles of 28 capsules (NDC [ZIP_CODE]- 140-01). 
Storage and handling 
Drug storage will be in the site pharmacy, according to institutional guidelines. Store at room temperature 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).  
 
Side Effects  
Though no specific concomitant medications are prohibited during this study (other than concomitant anti -tumor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), vismodegib may potentially affect the pharmacokinetics of 
other drugs by [CONTACT_633738]. In addition, metabolic inducers could possibly modify the pharmacokinetics of vismodegib. Therefore, concomitant medications should be used with care, and the risk benefit profile of each agent should be taken in to consideration.  
Identified Risks  (excerpted from IB, version 6.0, dated 01 -25-2012)  
The safety of vismodegib has been evaluated in [ADDRESS_846214] one 150 mg dose of vismodegib monotherapy. Doses > 150 mg did not result in higher plasma concentrations in patients administered doses > [ADDRESS_846215] been included in 
analyses. In general, the observed safety profile was consistent between mBCC and locally advanced BCC patients as described below.  
Adverse reactions are presented by [CONTACT_633739] 16. Frequencies are defined as:  
• Very common: ≥ 1/10  
• Common: <1/10 to ≥ 1/100  
• Uncommon: <1/100 to ≥1/1000

 Note: Vismodegib in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of any adverse 
event currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may result in events never previously associated with either agent.  
Complete and updated adverse event information is available in the Investigational Drug Brochure and/ or product package insert .  
4.2 Radiation Therapy  
The administration of radiation therapy is outlined in section 5.2.  
There will be expected radiation related toxicities ; very likely toxicities are mucositis, mouth 
dryness or changes in taste and/or smell that may be permanent , thick sali va, hoarseness, 
tanning or redness and/or irritation of the skin in the head and neck area being treated with radiation, e ar pain and/or pressure, fatigue, weight loss, permanent hair loss in the area treated 
with radiation (face, chin, neck), and hypersensitivity of teeth and/or loss of teeth  or cavities in 
the teeth, if strict dental care is not followed. 
Serious but less likely toxicities are decrease s in function of the thyroid gland that may require 
thyroid replacement therapy ; serious damage to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], nerves in the neck, jawbone, 
larynx, skin, or other parts of the head and neck that may require surgical intervention and may 
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 23 of 74 be life threatening; temporary pain or scarring around nerves in the shoulder that could cause 
numbness and/or weakness; breathing problems; difficulty with swallowing and eating, 
possibility of inhaling food and/or liquids into the lungs which could result in pneumonia; s erious 
ear infections and/or hearing loss ; damage to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_633704]/or symptoms like a stroke; loss of hearing; and decreased vision. 
In general, the anticipated toxicities from the combination of vismodegib and radiation therapy 
should not be over lappi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] a synergistic fashion with the possible exception of wound healing. 
It is possible that the side effects of radiation therapy which are related to wound healing may be intensified in the presence of vismodegib. In the absence of any further surgical procedures given after the combined therapy, it is not expected that there should be  serious  additional 
toxicity related to wound healing over that expected from a typi[INVESTIGATOR_633705]- of-care radiation 
therapy course, although these types of effects will be tracked carefully as part of this study protocol .

Sponsor -Investigator  will agree to the reconciliation periodicity and format, but agree at 
minimum to exchange monthly line listings of cases received by [CONTACT_15481]. If discrepancies 
are identified, the Sponsor -Investigator  and Genentech will cooperate in resolving the 
discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each party shall handle the matter on a case- by-
case basis until satisfactory resolution.  
5 Treatment Plan  
5.1 Dosage and Administration:  Vismodegib  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Patients will take vismodegib 150 mg 
orally  (QD PO) .  Prior to Radiation Treatment, patients will take vismodegib (150 mg/day) for 
approximately 12 weeks , then for 1- 14. days as required until the start of radiation therapy .  If 
there is an unforeseen delay in starting the radiation therapy after the induction phase , an 
additional 1- 2 weeks of treatment with vismodegib may be given after contact[CONTACT_633740].  D uring radiation treatment , vismodegib (150mg/day) 
concurrent treatment will be given on the same day as the first fraction of radiation therapy  and 
will continue daily through the completion of radiation treatment. The patient will be requested to 
maintain a medication diary of each dose of medication.  The medication diary will be returned to clinic staff approximately every four weeks (Week 5, 9, 13- 15, 18, and at the end of drug 
treatment ) .

5.2 Dosage and Administration:  Radiation Therapy   
5.2.1  Three -dimensional conformal radiation therapy  
For three -dimensional conformal radiation therapy, t he PTV1 (CTV1 + margin) will receive 
6600- 7000 cGy in 33- 35 fractions , with the final prescribed dose decided per discretion of the 
prescribing investigator,  and the PTV2 (CTV2 + margin) will receive [ADDRESS_846218] -induction restaging 
and any areas involved on the initial imaging prior to induction, even if the area has responded 
to the drug. The PTV2 should encompass any areas of elective coverage deemed necessary, 
such as the regional lymph node drainage basins. 
Treatment will be delivered once daily, 5 fractions per week, over 7 weeks. After the initial 25 
fractions for treatment of the PTV2, a reduced field will be given encompassing only PTV1.  If 
PTV2 is not required, then PTV1 will be treated for the entire course of radiation.  
The reported doses for PTV1 and PTV2 shall include the prescription dose as well as the 
maximum point dose (maximum dose encompassing 0.1 cc volume) for that PTV, % PTV 
receiving > 110% and 115%  for that PTV and the PTV receiving < 93% of the prescribed dose 
for that PTV, and the mean dose for that PTV.  
All plans shall be normalized such that 95% of the volume of each PTV is covered by [CONTACT_122923]. To avoid a minor variation:   
• No more than 20% of PTV1 will receive 1 10% of the prescription dose  and no more than 
5% of PTV1 will receive 115% of the prescription dose.  
• No more than 1% of any distinct PTV should receive <93% of its prescribed dose.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_846219]. 
For intensity modulated radiation therapy, the PTV2 (CTV2 + margin), if deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_093],  will receive 5000 cGy in 25 fractions and the PTV1 (CTV1 + margin) will 
receive 6600- 7000 cGy in 33-35 fractions  (maximum total dose to be at discretion of the 
investigator) . The PTV1 should encompass any anatomic areas involve d by [CONTACT_633741] -induction restaging and any anatomic areas involved on the initial 
imaging prior to induction, even if the area has exhibited response to the drug. The PTV2 should 
encompass any areas of elective coverag e deemed necessary, such as the regional lymph 
node drainage basins.  
Treatment will be delivered once daily, at a rate of [ADDRESS_846220] at

plan can be used in which the PTV1 receives 6600- 7000 cGy in 33- 35 fractions, but the PTV2 is 
to be treated in the same plan for all 33-35 fractions . For this approach, the PTV2 dose should 
be increased to 5400- 5600 cGy given in 33- 35 fractions , to account for the more extended 
fractionation schema.  
The reported doses for PTV1 and PTV2 shall include the prescription dose as well as the 
maximum point dose (maximum dose encompassing 0.1 cc volume) for that PTV, % PTV receiving > 110% and 115% for that PTV and the PTV receiving < 93% of the prescribed dose for that PTV, and the mean dose for that PTV.  
All plans shall be normalized such that 95% of the volume of each PTV is covered by [CONTACT_122923]. To avoid a minor variation:   
• No more than 20% of PTV1 will receive 1 10% of the prescription dose  and no more than 
5% of PTV1 will receive 115% of the prescription dose.  
• No more than 1% of any distinct PTV should receive <93% of its prescribed dose.  
5.2.3  Technical Factors  
[IP_ADDRESS]  External Beam Equipment and Beam Delivery Methods  
Megavoltage equipment capable of delivering static modulation with a multileaf collimator or dynamic intensity modulation (using a multileaf collimator or tomotherapy) is require d. 
Volumetric  arc delivery techniques can be used . 
5.2.[ADDRESS_846223] scans will be required t o define gross target volume(s)  and clinical target 
volume(s). The treatment planning CT scan should be acquired with the patient in the same position and using the same immobilization device as for treatment.  
All tissues to be irradiated must be included in the CT scan. CT scan slice thickness should be 
no more than 0.[ADDRESS_846224].   
5.2.5  Treatment Planning/Target  Volumes  
The definition of volumes will be in accordance with the 1993 ICRU Report #50, but the dose reporting and prescription are specified in Sections 5.2.   
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 26 of 74 The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) is defined as all known gross disease determined from 
imaging stu dies at presentation, clinical information, and physical examination findings. The 
GTV should encompass any area of disease visible or palpable at post -induction restaging and 
any areas involved on the initial imaging prior to induction, even if the area has responded to the drug. Grossly positive lymph nodes are defined as any lymph nodes > [ADDRESS_846225] scan image dataset to more accurately define the GTV  as it existed prior to 
induction with vismodegib. To further subdivide the GTV, gross disease at the primary site may 
be designated as GTV- P and clinically involved gross lymph nodes may be  designated GTV -N. 
In situations where the patient underwent surgical biopsy or surgery prior to radiation therapy, 
the GT V is defined as the residual gross disease thought to remain following the surgery.  
The Clinical Target Volume (CTV): See Sections 5.2 for delineation details.  
For patients without complete surgical resection: In terms of the GTV (GTV -P and GTV -N), a 
margin of 5 mm should be given circumferentially around the GTV (GTV -P and GTV -N) and this 
volume will be called the CTV1 (CTV1 -P and CTV1 -N). This margin can be reduced to as low as 
[ADDRESS_846226] undergone a prior surgical resection: CTV2 should include all of the 
original sites of gross disease at the primary disease site and any grossly involved but resected 
lymph nodes (e.g the post -operative bed) . A CTV1 should be delineated if a region has had 
surgery but still contains residual gross disease. 
To further define the subclinical region at risk for microscopic spread at the primary disease site, CTV2 -P includes CTV1- P + at least [ADDRESS_846227] or brain. At the discretion of the treating physician, elective nodal regions considered to be at high risk can be covered in CTV2 when indicated.  
Note: Thus, if CTV -[ADDRESS_846228] or other  sensitive or critical 
structures, the total margin between GTV -P and CTV2- P can be as low as 2 mm.   
A separate Planning Target Volume (PTV) will provide a margin around the CTV’s to compensate for the variabilities of treatment set up and internal organ motion. A minimum of 3  
mm around the CTV’s is required in all directions to define each respective PTV (PTV1, PTV2). Careful consideration should be made when defining the superior and inferior margins in three dimensions. Note that at any given point, the margin from the GTV to the PTV1 should usually 
be at least [ADDRESS_846229] or other sensitive structures where CTV margins  may be 
reduced as described; for these cases, the PTV may be set as equal to the CTV to ensure avoidance of critical neural structures.  In these exceptionally difficult cases, the total expansion 
from the GTV to the PTV1 could be as low as [ADDRESS_846230] 
risk; expansion to the larger standard margins is encouraged wherever possible.  
The treatment plan used for each patient will be based on an analysis of the volumetric dose, 
including dose- volume histogram (DVH) analyses of the PTVs and critical normal structures. An 
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 27 of 74 “inverse” planning process using computerized optimization should be used. The treatment aim 
will be the delivery of radiation to the PTVs and the exclusion of non- involved tissue.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_846231] the planner in identifying the critical normal structures. If planning risk volumes (PRVs) are used, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_633706] a three -dimensi onal margin at 
least [ADDRESS_846232]. The normal tissues will be contoured and considered as solid organs. The tissue within the skin surface and outside all other critical normal structures and PTVs is designated as unspecified tissue.  
DVH’s must be generated for all critical normal structures, any corresponding PRVs, and the unspecified tissues. Institutions that use PRVs must clearly define them as such.  
Unspecified tissue outside the targets: No more than 8cc of unspecified tissue can receive 
greater than 6600 cGy or more and no more than 1cc of unspecified tissue can receive 7000 
cGy or more. Participants are strongly encouraged to remain within these l imits. The treating 
physician is encouraged to call the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_633707].  
The method used for tissue heterogeneity calculations shall be recorded . The dose prescription 
is to be based on a dose distribution corrected for heter ogeneities.  
5.2.7  Planning Goals: Normal Structures  
 These dose objectives are recommendations. An effort should be made to stay within the 
normal tissue dose guidelines stipulated in this protocol.  
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406]: The PRV should not exceed 48 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). The spi[INVESTIGATOR_445154] [ADDRESS_846233] priority.  
• Brainstem: The PRVbrainstem should not exceed 56 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.03 
cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). In treatment planning, the PRVbrainstem should be given less priority than the PRVcord but more priority than other critical 
structures.  
• Optic chiasm, optic nerves, and globe: The PRV should not exceed 54 G y to any volume 
in excess of 0.01 cc.  Every effort should be made to keep the dose as low as possible in 
these areas.  
• Parotid glands: Mean dose < [ADDRESS_846234] 20 cc of the combined volume of both parotid glands will receive < [ADDRESS_846235] 50% of one gland will receive < [ADDRESS_846236] mean doses as possible without compromising tumor coverage.  
• Submandibular glands and oral cavity: Reduce the dose as much as possible, preferably 
with a mean dose < [ADDRESS_846237] be covered, there is no need to constrain the submandibular glands.  
• Mandible: Reduce the dose as much as possible. It is  recognized that portions of the 
mandible will overlap the CTVs and/or PTVs but hot spots within the mandible should be avoided. It is recommended that maximum dose within the mandible be < 6600 cGy.  
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page [ADDRESS_846238] important 
planning priorities. The priorities in addressing the protocol aims  and constraints will be in the 
following order: 1) Critical Normal Structure Constraints (Section 5.2.6 ); 2) Dose Specifications 
(Section 5.2); 3) Planning Goals: Salivary glands (Section 5.2.7 ); 4) Planning Goals: Other 
normal structures (Section 5.2.7 ).  
5.[ADDRESS_846239]’s condition prior to resuming the patient’s treatment, except for delays due to hypertension. As a patient progresses from one treatment to another (i.e., pre -radiation therapy, 
radiation therapy, post radiation therapy), the patient should remain at the SAME DOSE LEVEL.   
5.3.1  Intolerable Toxicity Requiring Discontinuation of Vismodegib  
Intolerable toxicities are defined as new (not present at baseline) Grade 3 or 4 adverse events  
considered related to vismodeg ib that are likely to be life- threatening or irreversible, and when in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the risk outweighs the benefit of continued treatment . 
The following adverse events are not considered intolerable:  
• Grade 3 or 4 events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_633708]  
• Hematologic or metabolic/chemistry laboratory abnormalities that are found on routine testing and are not considered clinically  significant  
• Musculoskeletal abnormalities, skin ulceration, fracture, debridement or wound care, and dental or periodontal disease related to underlying medical conditions  
• Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that is adequately controlled after optimization of  medical 
management.  
• Grade 3 infection that is transient and treatable or manageable 
• Grade 3 sterility  
• Asymptomatic thromboembolism found incidentally on imaging and managed with anti -
coagulation therapy

degree of toxicity.  
5.5 Other Therapy  
5.5.1  Permitted Supportive Therapy  
All supportive therapy for optimal medical care will be given during the study period at the discretion of the attending physician(s) within the parameters of the protocol and documented on each site’s source documents as concomitant medication.  
After the [ADDRESS_846241]- of-care treatment for recurrence or for other skin cancers. These 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_633709]. 
5.5.2  Non-permitted Supportive Therapy  
The patient’s medications will be evaluated within 4 weeks prior to treatment (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]) to  assess any medication that affects CYP3A4.  
Certain medications act through the CYP450 system. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole may increase vismodegib concentrations and are generally prohibited although, if absolutely necessary, they may be administered with 
caution. Grapefruit juice is also an inhibitor of CYP450. CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decrease vismodegib concentrations and therefore are strictly prohibited. Caution should be used when strong inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP2D6 are co -administered with vismodegib. 
Concomit ant use of vismodegib with agent with narrow therapeutic windows that are 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, CYP2D6 or CYP2C8 should be avoided. In addition, the use of St. John’s Wart is not recommended.  
Vismodegib, [ADDRESS_846242] vismodegib through 
the cytochrome P450 system can be found in Appendix 5. No drugs are specifically prohibited 
but caution is recom mended for these agents.  
Amifostine or other intravenously administered supportive systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_633710].

Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page [ADDRESS_846243] along with the reason(s) for 
the treatment break(s). Treatment breaks, if necessary, should ideally not exceed five treatment days at a time and ten treatment days total. Treatment breaks should be allowed only for resolution of severe acute toxicity and/or for intercurrent illness and not for social or logistical reasons. Treatment or visit delays for public holidays or weather conditions do not constitute a 
protocol violation.  
Institutions are encouraged to generate treatment that fall within the dose limits defining the per protocol category. For those target to critical structures geometries that are more challenging, some variation from the specified protocol dose limits is acceptable.   
[ADDRESS_846244]  unless otherwise noted.  Any results falling 
outside of the reference ranges may be repeated at the discretion of the investigator. All on-study visit procedures are allow ed a window of ±  3 days unless otherwise noted.   Treatment or 
visit delays for public holidays or weather conditions do not constitute a protocol violation.  
A written, signed, informed consent form (ICF) and a Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must be obtained before any study -specific 
assessments are initiated.  A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the subject and a copy will 
be filed in the medical record.  The original will be kept on file with the study records.    
All patients who are consented will be registered in OnCore®, the UCSF Helen Diller Family 
Comprehensive Cancer Center Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS).  The system is password protected and meets HIPAA requirements.

6.1.5  Long Term/Survival Follow -up Procedures  
The study team will follow  patient s for survival outcome via telephone calls or medical record 
requests approximately every [ADDRESS_846251] .  Additional, s urvival follow -up information may be collected via telephone 
calls and/or at clinic visits every [ADDRESS_846252] with the patient, a family member, or physician to inquire about the patient’s 
survival status.  
If/when a subject begins a new type of non -protocol treatment for laBCC or mBCC, long- term 
follow up may cease.  Subjects will continue to be followed if they have not recurred local -
regionally within the original treated PTV. If they have a BCC in a non- treated separate location, 
or if metastatic disease occurs, subjects will continue to be followed for the local -regional 
disease control outcomes. Subjects would be taken off protocol if they have any form of non-
protocol treatment affecting the primary local or nodal site that was originally treated or if they receive vismodegib or other Hedgehog inhibitor or chemotherapy outside of original protocol parameters.  Patients off study protocol who need to have vismodegib will not have drug 
provided by [CONTACT_1758].  
6.1.6  Discontinuation of Therapy  
The Investigator will withdraw a patient whenever continued participation is no longer in the patient’s best interests.  Reasons for withdrawing a patient include, but are not limited to, disease progression inside the PTV or at distant sites at any point, the occurrence of an adverse 
event or a concurrent illness, exce ssive delay in protocol treatment (greater than 4 weeks ), a 
patient’s request to end participation, a patient’s non- compliance or simply significant 
uncertainty on the part of the Investigator that continued participation is prudent.  There may also be administrative reasons to terminate participation, such as concern about a patient’s compliance with the prescribed treatment regimen.

follow- up information may be collected via telephone calls and/or at clinic visits every 3 months for 12 months.  
2. The reporting period for adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will begin at the time of enrollment and continues until [ADDRESS_846257] to follow -up. 
3. A complete physical  exam includes evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, and neurological 
systems.  Exam includes height (at screening only) and weight.  
4. Vital signs include pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature.  
5. For externally visible tumors.   Can be done up to 180 days prior to day 1.  Additional biopsy after screening will only be to confirm progression.

lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and other cells).  
8. Serum chemistry includes glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, sodium, potassium, magnesium,  chloride,  bicarbonate (if routinely perf ormed on venous blood samples), calcium,  
total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT , and as clinically indicated; LDH, and phosphorus  
9. The CT scan with contrast or an MRI with gadolinium must be done unless medically contraindicated.  The MRI or CT scan must encompass the skull base and/or upper mediastinum if those areas are involved.  If locally advanced BCC lesions with a RECIST -measurable component are identified, the same imaging modality used at baseline must be used throughout the study.  
10. Locally advanced BCC patients should have a CT of the chest and abdomen at baseline to assess for possible metastatic disease or other significant abnormalities. Abdominal imaging must cover the liver and adrenal glands; therefore, separate abdominal imaging is not required if these areas are covered by a chest CT scan.

Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 37 of 74 6.2 Usage of Concurrent /Concomitant  Medications  
Though no specific concomitant medications are prohibited during this study (other than 
concomitant anti -tumor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), vismodegib may potentially affect the pharmacokinetics of 
other drugs by [CONTACT_633738]. In addition, metabolic inducers could possibly modify the pharmacokinetics of vismodegib. Therefore, concomitant medications should be used with care, and the risk benefit profile of each agent should be taken in to consideration.  
Vismodegib inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 drug metabolism enzymes in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. Caution should be exercised and dose reduction of the concomitant substrate drug should be considered when dosing vismodegib concurrently with medications with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, because their concentrations may become elevated and their effects increased or prolonged .  
Vismodegib did not significantly inhibit CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro; however, the clinical impact of vismodegib on substrates of CYP3A4 is unknown. Vismodegib is a substrate of CYP3A4; however, the in vitro metabolic conversion of vismodegib is low. Effects of CYP inducers (i.e, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, St John’s wort, and troglitazone) on clinical concentrations of vismodegib are unknown; it is possible that these drugs could reduce concentrations of vismodegib. Likewise, the effects of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i.e., clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, telithromycin) on vismodegib clinical concentrations are unknown; it is possible that these drugs could increase the concentrations of vismodegib. Use of these drugs should be documented.  
The table in Appendix [ADDRESS_846259]; other medications may also interact with vismodegib.  
[ADDRESS_846260] one dimension as ≥20mm with CT or MRI scan or on color photographs.  Patients will undergo tumor assessments 
per RECIST tumor response criteria outlined below.  No central revie w of imaging data will be 
required due to the visual clarity in identify ing the lesions and the consistent method of 
assessment to be used by [CONTACT_106189].  
Prior radiation therapy is acceptable but there cannot be major overlap of the previously  
irradiated tissues with the new radiation treatment volumes anticipated to be delivered for the purposes of this protocol, in such a way that curative intent with radiation cannot be met. Furthermore, the total dose from all radiation delivered and expected to be delivered should not exceed the suggested dose constraints given for normal structures . 
To ensure a valid comparison of tumor data and uniformity in the assessment of tumor response and disease progression, the following procedure s should be implemented.  
The same local physician should perform all physical tumor assessment evaluations for an 
individual patient.  Radiologic interpretation should be performed by [CONTACT_633743].  
All lesions (targe t and non- target) identified at baseline will be reassessed according to the 
imaging schedule provided in Table 6- 1. The same method of evaluation (either CT scan or 
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 38 of 74 MRI), and/or color photography in the case of skin lesions, if feasible, must be used from 
baseline until the end of the study.  
7.1 Evaluation of Efficacy  (or Activity)  
A new cutaneous BCC will be considered as progressive local -regional disease (locally or 
regionally relapsed) if the lesion is > 5 mm, within the PTVs, and can be clearly documented  as 
not being previously present. The new lesion should be biopsied but will be considered as PD 
unless confirmed on biopsy not to be consistent with BCC. If the new cutaneous lesion is not biopsied or the histology is inconclusive, it should be considered  to be BCC and indicative of 
PD. Significant enlargement of a cutaneous BCC that was present at baseline should also be 
considered as PD. 
If imaging shows a high likelihood of distant metastases (investigators are highly encouraged to contact [CONTACT_633744]), ongoing protocol -
prescribed therapy may be terminated  based on evaluation of potential clinical benefits versus 
risks to the patient, as assessed by [CONTACT_1704] . The patient may still be eligible for 
follow -up, per stipulations in section 6.1.5. New distant metastatic lesions should be biopsied if 
possible and will be considered as PD unless confirmed on biopsy not to be consistent with 
BCC. If the new metastatic lesion is not biopsied or the histology is inconclusive, it should be considered to be indicative of PD. 
Note: Information about patients who have progressed on study and been removed from study may be voluntarily submitted at the discretion of the treating investigator (see Section 6.1.5 ). 
7.[ADDRESS_846261] – Solid Tumors  
Response and progression in this study will be evaluated using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] ( RECIST ) Committee [JNCI 
92(3):205- 216, 2000].  Assessments should include an evaluation of all sites of disease. 
Patients will undergo tumor assessments per RECIST tumor response criteria. Screening digital photographs of visible portions of the  lesions may be taken any time from the start of screening 
until just prior to dosing on Day 1.  Tumor measurements will be performed measuring the 
maximal diameter as the maximal extent of tumor plus any adjacent or underlying ulceration.  
Any tumors which were included in the original assessment as either a primary involved site or 
involved regional lymph node must be measured .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity  
All patients receiving any study drug will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their fir st 
treatment with the study drug.  
Evaluable for objective response  
Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have  completed at least 
75% of protocol -mandated radiotherapy , and have had their disease re -evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of induction therapy  will also be considered evaluable.)

Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 39 of 74 [IP_ADDRESS]  Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease  
Measurable disease is defined as lesions (or tumors) that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) with a minimum size of 10mm by [CONTACT_14216] (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the slice thickness and a 
minimum of 10mm), 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (when superficial), and/or 20mm by [CONTACT_13190] X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]). 
Tumor measurements will be performed measuring the maximal diameter as the maximal extent of tumor plus any adjacent or underlying ulceration.  All tumor measurements will be recorded in millimeters or decimal fractions of centimeters.  Previously irradiated lesions are considered non-measurable except in cases of documented progression of the lesion since the completion 
of radiation therapy.  
Target lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions will be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218]. 
Non-measurable disease  
Non-measurable disease  is all other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <  20 mm with conventional techniques or <  [ADDRESS_846262] scan).  
Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identifi ed 
by [CONTACT_633745]-
measurable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements will be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations will be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than [ADDRESS_846263]  (iodinated or gadolinium)  unless  
medically contraindicated.   These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_846264], abdomen, and pelvis .

Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 40 of 74 [IP_ADDRESS]  Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all target lesions  in the irradiated PTV, determined by [CONTACT_308072] 4 weeks apart.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm (the sum may not be “0” if 
there  are target nodes).  There can be no appearance of new lesions  in irradiated PT V. 
Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions  in the 
irradiated PTV, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  There  can be no appearance of new 
lesions  in irradiated PT V. 
Progressive Disease (PD)  
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest 
sum SLD recorded since the treatment started and minimum 5 mm increase over the nadir, or 
the appearance of one or more new lesions  in the irradiated PTV . 
Stable Disease (SD)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on 
the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response 
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD  is objectively 
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 41 of 74 documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment sta rted).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.   
Duration of stable disease 
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
Progression- Free Survival  
Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to tim e 
of progression or death due to any cause. 
7.3 Assessment of Failure Patterns  
Local or Regional Relapse  
Relapse is defined as reappearance of tumor after complete response. If possible, relapse should be confirmed by [CONTACT_9256].  
 
Local or Regional Progression  
Progression is defined as an estimated increase in the size of the tumor (product of the perpendicular diameters of the two largest dimensions) of greater than 20%, taking as reference 
the smallest value of all previous measurements or appearance of new areas of malignant disease. This should be compared to radiology reassessment done after the completion of radiation therapy.  
 
Distant Metastasis Progression  
Progression of a distant metastasis (e.g. lung, bone, brain, liver) is defined as an estimated increase in the size of the tumor (product of the perpendicular diameters of the two largest 
dimensions) of greater than 20 %, taking as reference the smallest value of all previous 
measurements or appearance of new areas of malignant disease. This should be compared to 
radiology reassessment done after the completion of radiation therapy.

reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related to vismodegib , all events of death, and any study specific issue of concern.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_14167].  
The Study Chair is respons ible for the overall conduct of the study and for monitoring its safety 
and progress at all participating sites.   The Study Chair is responsible for ensuring that all AEs 
and SAEs that are observed or reported during the study, are collected and reported t o the 
FDA, appropriate IRB(s), and Genentech, Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
The study period during which all AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after informed consent is obtained and initiation of study treatment and ends [ADDRESS_846268] 
administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment.

Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 42 of 74 7.5 Definitions of Adverse Events  
7.5.1  Advers e Event  
An adverse event (also known as an adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  More specifically, an adverse event  (can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  An adverse event can arise from any use of the 
drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with locally advanced BCC of 
the head and neck  that were not present prior to the AE reporting period. 
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as cardiac catheterizations ). 
If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with medication 
washout, no treatment run- in, or other protocol -mandated intervention.  
Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_95048] -specified AE reporting period.  
7.5.2  Adverse reaction  
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_2224] a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected  
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” indicates that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected   
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or package insert(s), or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed, or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to  adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page [ADDRESS_846269] case of angioedema observed with the drug under investigation should be 
considered unexpected for reporting purposes.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious  if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• Life-threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
norm al life function  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Life-threatening 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered life-threatening if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
7.6 Recording of an Adverse Event  
All grade 3 and above adverse events will be entered into OnCore®, whether or not the event is 
believed to be associated with use of the study  drug.  Data about these events and their severity 
will be recorded using the NCI CTCAE  v4.0.   
The Investigator will assign attribution of the possible association of the event with use of the investigational drug, and this information will be entered into OnCore
® using the classification 
system listed below:

Signs or symptoms reported as adverse events will be graded and recorded by [CONTACT_40607]  v 4.0 .  When specific adverse events are not listed in the CTCAE  v 4.0  
they will be graded by [CONTACT_40608], mild, moderate or severe  according to the 
following grades and definitions:  
Grade 0  No AE (or within normal limits)  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms;  clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention (e.g., packing, cautery) 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)

7.8 Adverse Events Monitoring  
All adverse events, whether or not unexpected, and whether or not considered to be associated with the use of the study drug, will be entered into OnCore
®, as noted above.  
The Investigator will assess all adverse events and determine reportability requirem ents to the 
UCSF Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  and UCSF’s Institutional Review Board 
(IRB); and, when the study is conducted under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), 
to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  if it meets the FDA reporting criteria.. 
All adverse events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed by [CONTACT_559422] a weekly basis.  The Site Committee will 
review and discuss at each weekly meeting the selected toxicity, the toxicity grade, and the attribution of relationship of the adverse event to the admini stration of the study drug(s).

into OnCore® will be reviewed and monitored by [CONTACT_633746] (6) weeks.  For 
a detailed description of the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for a Multicenter Study  refer to 
Appendix  9. 
7.9 Expedited  Reporting  
Participating sites reporting to Study Chair  
In addition to complying with all applicable regulatory reporting laws and regulations, each site will report the follo wing information in writing to the Sponsor -Investigator  within one business 
day of the Investigator’s awareness of occurrence:  
• All SAEs  
• Reports of pregnancy exposure (pregnancy encompasses the entire course of pregnancy and delivery, perinatal and neonatal outcomes, even if there were no 
abnormal findings; both maternal and paternal exposure is collected);  
• Reports of lactation exposure;

Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 47 of 74 8 Statistical Considerations  and Evaluation of Results  
8.1 Study Design 
This is a single arm , multi -center,  phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of treating 
locally advanced and metastatic BCC patients with vismodegib alone followed by [CONTACT_633748] a total of 21 weeks.  After completing protoc ol therapy 
patients will be followed for 12 months.  The primary efficacy study outcome measure is the proportion of patients with local- regional control at 12 months  after completing protocol therapy.   
8.2 Study Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint : 
• The proportion of patients with l ocal-regional  control at 12 months  from protocol therapy 
completion, defined as complete or partial response, with absence of PD (see section 
7.2) within the irradiated PTV.   
Secondary Endpoints :  
• Estimate of the probability  of PFS and OS  [ADDRESS_846274].   
• Number and attribution of all adverse events (including vital signs, physical findings, and 
clinical laboratory results , CTCAE, v 4. 0) in patients who receive any amount of study 
drug and radiation therapy.  
• For each toxicity , the maximum occurring grade will be tabulated for each patient.  The 
results will be summarized by [CONTACT_633749], 
during concurrent vismodegib with radiation therapy, for 3 months immediately following the completion of protocol therapy and for up to  12 months  after completion of protocol 
therapy. The focus will be on the proportion of patients experiencing >grade 3 toxicity 
during each of these intervals.  
• Proportion of patients experiencing Grade 4-5 adverse event s assessed to be definitely, 
probably, or possibly related to the induction or concurrent treatment components of the 
protocol regimen (that is not definitely related to disease progression).  
• Proportion  of patients discontinuing  treatment due to toxicity  during the concurrent  
administration of vismodegib and radiation therapy. For this endpoint, discontinuation is 
defined as < 75% of planned radiation therapy delivered. 
• Response rate per RECIST criteria in patients who complete initial combined therapy  of 
the primary site and regionally involved areas in subjects with measurable disease prior to initiation of therapy  at 3 months after completion of protoc ol therapy.  
• Proportion of pat ients with a decrease of BCC within the irradiated PTV after completing 
all protocol therapy  to estimate clinical response to vismodegib and radiation therapy . 
8.3 Determination of Sample Size and Accrual Rate  
8.3.1  Sample Size and Power  Estimate  
The sample size for this single- arm phase II study is based upon the anticipated degree of 
improvement in the primary clinical hypothesis (i.e. local -regional control rate)  at 12 months  
after completing all protocol  treatment. The null hypothesis  is that 60% of patients treated may 
achieve local-regional control after treatment on the study. Patients treated for advanced- stage 
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 48 of 74 nonmelanomatous skin cancers typi[INVESTIGATOR_85578] 50- 60% local -regional control with radiation 
therapy alone. The alternative hypothesis is that 80% of the patients will obtain local- regional 
control at [ADDRESS_846275] BCC  
when administered alone . 
Sample Size Justification:  With accrual of [ADDRESS_846276] 81% power 
to detect an increase in the overall proportion of patients achieving local- regional control  
assuming  a directional level of significance of 0.[ADDRESS_846277] 75% of radiation therapy given concurrently with 
vismodegib without grade ≥[ADDRESS_846278] of this study, t oxicity will 
also be evaluated weekly so that any unacceptable toxicity can be identified early. If there is no 
reason to stop accrual (as defined below),  the remainder of the 19 patients will be recruited.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]: Acceptable occurrence of toxicity is defined as the discontinuation of treatment  
in ≤40% of patients (2 of 5 patients who discontinue protocol treatment, having completed <75% 
of planned radiation therapy)  and the proportion of patients with grade 4 -5 toxicity is ≤20%.  
Accrual of the final [ADDRESS_846279] to demographic and baseline characteristics and safety 
observations and measurements. The assessment of safety will include calculation of all 
specified study endpoints (see section 8.2) and will be based mainly on the frequency and

Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page 49 of 74 3 or higher AEs related to the treatment components.   Adverse events will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_216303].  Any other 
information collected (e.g. severity or relatedness to study medication) will be listed as 
appropriate.  Toxicities will be tabulated by [CONTACT_633750] 4.1 during each of 4 protocol stages (vismodegib 
alone, in combination with radiation therapy, during the immediate 3  months following 
completion of protocol therapy and then up to  12 months  of follow -up after completing 
treatment).  
To evaluate the primary protocol aim the proportion of patients with l ocal-regional control (LRC) ,  
those with a CR or PR as defined by [CONTACT_454506] , at 12 months  after completing protocol 
therapy will be calculated and presented with 95% confidence intervals .  As a most conservative 
estimate of disease control any patient beginning concurrent vismodegib and radiation therapy 
who is removed from study  prior to  completion of at least 75% of radiation therapy without a 
documented complete or partial response will be considered as a local-regional failure. To test 
the primary study hypothesis the observed proportion with LRC will be compared with the null hypothesis of 60% using a one sample test of a binomial proportion.   
The secondary clinical aims of the duration of progression free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) will be measured from the start of protocol therapy until death due to any cause  or 
until the first evidence of any disease progression, or death, respectively.  Point estimates (e.g. 
median, percent PFS at 12 months) with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using the 
Kaplan- Meier product limit method to summarize results.  Based upon RECIST criteria, the 
proportion of patients responding in the primary site and regionally involved areas at 3 months 
after completing protocol therapy will be determined and presented with 95% confidence intervals.   The proportion of patients achieving any decrease in BCC within the boundaries of 
the treated radiation PTV area will be determined and presented with a 95% confidence interval.  In addition, the proportion of  patients who start concurrent vismodegib and radition therapy and 
receiv e at least 75% of the planned radiation therapy will be determined and presented with a 
95% confidence interval to  summarize the feasibility of administering concomitant therapy .  
8.5.[ADDRESS_846280] 75% of radiation therapy without a documented complete or partial response will be considered as a case of local- regional failure.  
Failure is defined as a lack of local -regional c ontrol within the boundaries of the treated radiation 
PTV area within the [ADDRESS_846281] their origin in the Decla ration of Helsinki as stated in 21 CFR §312.120(c)(4); consistent with GCP and all

9.6 Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or his/her designee, will prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate participant case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study.  Study specific Case Report Forms (CRFs) will document safety and treatment outcomes for safety 
monitoring and data analysis.  All study data will be entered into OnCore
® via standardized 
CRFs in accordance with the CTMS study calendar, using single data entry with a secure access account.  The Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) will complete the CRFs as soon as possibl e upon completion of the study visit; the Investigator will review and approve the 
completed CRFs.  
The information collected on CRFs shall be identical to that appearing in original source documents.  Source documents will be found in the patient’s medical records maintained by [CONTACT_14228].  All source documentation should be kept in separate research folders for each patient.  
In accordance with federal regulations, the Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered onto CRFs.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_14159].  
All source documentation and CTMS data will be available for review/monitoring by [CONTACT_633751].  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_14160].  At 
study completion, when the CRFs have been declared to be complete and accurate, the 
database will be locked.  Any changes to the data entered into the CRFs  after that time can 
only be made by [CONTACT_14230] , the Trial Statistician, and the 
Protocol Project Manager.  
Each participating site will complete study specific CRFs for safety monitoring and data analysis.  Each site will enter the study data into OnCore
® via standardized CRFs in accordance 
with the CTMS study calendar, using single data entry with a secure access account. The participating site’s Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) will complete the CRFs; the Investigator will review and approve the completed CRFs – this process must be completed within 3 
business days of the visit. Study data from the participating site will be reported and reviewed in aggregate with data from patients enrolled at the coordinating center, UCSF.  All source documentation and CTMS data will be available for review/monitoring as needed.  
9.7 Modality Review  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_172155] a Quality Assurance Review of all patients in this trial. The goal of the review is to evaluate protocol compliance. The review process is contingent on timely submission of chemotherapy treatment data as specified in Appendix 8. The scoring mechanism is: Per Protocol/Acceptable Variation, Not Per Protocol, and Not Evaluable. A report is sent  to each institution once per year to notify the institution about compliance for each case 
reviewed in that year.

9.8 Oversight and Monitoring Plan  
The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center  DSMC  will be the monitoring 
entity for this study.  The UCSF DSMC will monitor the study in accordance with the NCI -
approved Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP).  The DSMC will routinely review all adverse 
events and suspected adverse reactions considered “serious”.  The DSMC will audit study -
related activities to ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the protocol , local 
standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Significant results of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as applicable.  See 
Appendix [ADDRESS_846286] of a multicenter clinical trial.  The UCSF Coordinating Center will also coordinate, at minimum, quarterly  conference calls with the 
participating sites or more frequently as needed to discuss risk assessment.  The following issues will be disc ussed as appropriate:   
• Enrollment information  
• Adverse events (i.e. new adverse events and updates on unresolved adverse events 
and new safety information)  
• Protocol violations  
• Other issues affecting the conduct of the study

9.11 Coordinating Center Documentation of Distribution 
It is the responsibility of the Study Chair to maintain adequate files documenting the distribution of study documents as well as their receipt (when possible). The HDFCCC recommends that the Study Chair maintain a correspondence file and l og for each segment of distribution (e.g., 
FDA, drug manufacturer, participating sites, etc.).  
Correspondence file: should contain copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (paper or electronic) of all protocol versions, cover letters, amendment outlines (summary of changes), etc., along with distribution documentation and (when available) documentation of receipt.  
Correspondence log: should be a brief list of all documents distributed including the date sent, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841](s), and (if available) a tracking number and date received.  
At a minimum , the Study Chair must keep documentation of when and to whom the protocol, its 
updates and safety information are distributed.

10 Protection of Human Subjects   
10.1 Protection from Unnecessary Harm  
Each clinical site is responsible for protecting all subjects involved in human experimentation. 
This is accomplished through the IRB mechanism and the process of informed consent. The 
IRB reviews all proposed studies involving human experimentation and ensures that the 
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page [ADDRESS_846289]’s rights and welfare are protected and that the potential benefits and/or the importance 
of the knowledge to be gained outweigh the risks to the individual. The IRB also reviews the 
informed consent document associated with each study in order to ensure that the consent document accurately and clearly communicates the nature of the research to be done and its associated risks and benefits.  
10.2 Protection of Privacy  
Patients will be informed of the extent to which their confidential health information generated 
from this study may be used for research purposes. Following this discussion, they will be asked 
to sign the HIPAA form and informed consent documents. The original signed document will 
become part of the patient’s medical records, and each patient will receive a copy of the signed 
document. The use and disclosure of protected health information will be limited to the individuals described in the informed consent document.

Appendix 4 Management of Dental Problems in Irradiated Patients  
Dental Care for Irradiated Patients Goals for a dental care program include:  
1. To reduce incidence of bone necrosis.  
2. To reduce incidence of irradiation caries.  
3. To allow proper fitting o f dentures following treatment.  
Pre-irradiation Care and Procedures The patients may be grouped into four groups in 
accordance with the problems they present prior to irradiation.  
Group [ADDRESS_846300] 1/[ADDRESS_846301] severe malocclusion in whom few carious lesions are present. Carious lesions are not in close proximity to the pulp and are correctable by [CONTACT_483831]. These patients require periodontal evaluation and dental prophylaxis training, restorations as needed, no extractions prior to radiation therapy, and fitting for custom carriers.  
Extraction of Teeth: If extraction of teeth is necessary prior to radiation therapy, the bone must 
be contoured so that closure at the extraction site is possible. All loose spi[INVESTIGATOR_633719]. The approximation of the gingival tissue must be such that the 
 
Version date: 11-07-2016  Protocol CC#: 122011  
Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page [ADDRESS_846302] 10 days are required for adequate healing prior 
to initiation of therapy.  
Causative Factors: The major causative factors appear to be the reduction of the amount of saliva and secondarily, reduced pH in the mouth. This occurs following high dose radiation to 
the major salivary glands using parallel opposed fields. The decay process usually occurs in the first year following radiation therapy. It tends to occur more quickly in teeth which have a large amount of root cementum exposed to those teeth with large amounts of plaque formation present. Doses of radiation in excess of [ADDRESS_846303] the teeth at risk.  
Preventive Program: The rationale behind the use of fluoride treatments is to make the tooth surfaces less suscepti ble to the decay process. This is accomplished by a combination of 
increasing fluoride concentration on the tooth surface and by [CONTACT_629562]. Adequate results are obtained by: 1) cleans ing the 
teeth thoroughly, followed by a good home care dental prophylaxis program, 2) construction of fluoride carriers, custom -made mouth guards, which provide local application of fluoride solution 
to the gingiva and tooth surfaces. Fluoride carriers are  made individually with the use of casts. 
Material used for making a mouth guard is "Sta -Guard" plastic used in conjunction with 
vacutrole unit produced by [CONTACT_629563], Corp., both of which are available through local dental supply. This mate rial is molded to the cast impression and allowed to harden. The 
patients are instructed to cleanse their teeth prior to placement of the carrier. It is then worn in place for 5 minutes each day. The patients are instructed to rinse their mouths thoroughly  
following the use of the carrier. This will be continued for an indefinite period of time. Close follow -up is necessary.  
Results: In the 5- 1/2 year program at the M.D. Anderson Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629491] 1966, a study of 
304 patients shows that the incidence of necrosis of the jaw was reduced to approximately 21% compared to 37% prior to initiation of the study. Groups 3 and 4 patients randomized with and without fluoride treatment showed reduction in radiation carries from 67% to 34% among Group 3 patients, and from 65% to 22% among Group 4 patients.  
Failure to Control Decay: Management of failure to control radiation decay includes silver fillings 
with continued use of fluoride treatments. If the decay process is sufficiently advanced that a filling will no longer stay in place, these teeth are merely smoothed so that there will be no 
sharp, irritating edges. The mere existence of such a decayed tooth is not necessarily reason for extraction, for it must be remembered that extraction could lead to complications such as bone necrosis.  
Pulp exposure resulting from the decay process can usually be handled by [CONTACT_629564]/or root -canal therapy.  
Hypersensitivity of Teeth: Occasionally, a patient will exhibit extreme sensitivity of the teeth secondary to  diminished amounts of saliva. This has been shown to be reduced in incidence 
with the fluoride treatments. Should this problem become manifest, increasing the fluoride treatment to 10 to 15 minutes 3 times a day is recommended.  
Infections: Infections occurring in patients under or after radiation therapy are best managed conservatively with good oral hygiene, irrigation and flushing procedures, and systemic antibiotics.  
Bone Necrosis: The patients receiving radiation therapy to a high dose to the head and neck region have increased susceptibility to bone necrosis for several reasons including: impairment of normal metabolism, increased susceptibility to infection and severely limited repair process.

Phase 2 – vismodegib & radiation therapy   Page [ADDRESS_846305] with Vismodegib 
Vismodegib  inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 drug metabolism enzymes in vitro at 
clinically relevant concentrations. Caution should be exercised and dose reduction of the 
concomitant substrate drug should be considered when dosi ng vismodegib concurrently with 
medications with narrow therapeutic windows that are  substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and 
CYP2C19, because their concentrations may  become elevated and their effects increased or 
prolonged.  
Vismodegib  did not significantly inhibit CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro; 
however, the clinical impact of vismodegib  on substrates of CYP3A4 is  unknown. Vismodegib is 
a substrate of CYP3A4; however, the in vitro metabolic  conversion of vismodegib  is low. Effects 
of CYP i nducers (i.e., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, St John’s 
wort, and troglitazone)  on clinical concentrations of vismodegib  are unknown; it is possible that 
these drugs  could reduce concentrations of vismodegib. Likewise, the effects of strong inhibitors  
of CYP3A4 (i.e., clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconaz ole, nefazodone, 
telithromycin) on vismodegib  clinical concentrations are unknown;  it is possible that these drugs 
could increase the concentrations of vismode gib. 
Use of these drugs with vismodegib should be documented. The table below lists substrate 
drugs in columns under the designation of specific  cytochrome P450 isoforms. A drug appears 
in a column if there is published evidence that it is metabolized, to a clinically relevant degree by 
[CONTACT_633754]  (Flockhart) or in the FDA table of in vivo substrates for study. This is not necessarily  
a complete list; other medications may also interact with vismodegib .

Procedures  
In these clinical photographs for the duration of the study, the only variable allowed to change is 
the skin condition itself. Therefore, anything extraneous to the condition  (furniture, etc.) is to be 
eliminated from the photographic field, starting at the entr y visit through the final visit. The 
necessity of good end -of-study photographs should be stressed to patients to ensure their 
cooperation. Lighting, framing, exposure,  and reproduction ratios must be held constant. In the 
end, the images should read like a time -lapse movie.  Any doubt as to the correctness of the 
photographic technique should result in an immediate re -shoot.

Adverse Event Monitoring 
All Grade 3 -5 Adverse Events, whether or not unexpected, and whether or not considered to be 
associated with the use of study drug, will be entered into OnCore®, UCSF’s Clinical Trial 
Management Sy stem.  
All Grade 3 -5 adverse events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed on a monthly basis at the 
UCSF Site Committee meetings. All clinically significant adverse events must be reported to the 
UCSF Coordinating Center by [CONTACT_14244] 10 business days of becoming aware 
of the event or during the next scheduled quarterly conference call, whichever is sooner. The UCSF Site Committee will review and discuss the selected toxicity, the toxicity grade, and the attribution of relationship of the  adverse event to the administration of the study drug(s) from the 
UCSF Coordinating Center and the participating sites. 
In addition, all suspected adverse reactions considered “serious” must be entered in OnCore® 
and reported to the UCSF Coordinating Center within 1 business day. The suspected adverse reactions considered “serious” will be reviewed and monitored by [CONTACT_633755], which take 
place every six (6) weeks.  
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study or within [ADDRESS_846310] 
administration of the study drug(s) and is determined to be related either to the investigational drug or any research related procedure, the Study Chair at the UCSF Coordinating Center or the assigned designee must be notified within 1 business day from the participating site(s) and the Study Chair must then notify the DSMC Chair or qualified alternate within [ADDRESS_846311] may be by [CONTACT_14223]  e-mail.

TITLE / MAIN QUESTION  
Do inflammatory biomarkers and needle electromyography (EMG) findings have independent 
predictive ability to identify patients with lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_225162]?  
BACKGRO UND & SIGNIFICANCE  
Lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_225163] a common cause of back pain and mobility impairment in older adults 
[1]. It is often a multifactorial condition resulting from degenerative changes in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and 
may result in severe disability, with sympto ms of lower back pain and/or pain, numbness and 
weakness of the lower extremities that are often exacerbated by [CONTACT_225191]/or standing [2]. 
Since lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_225164], 
symptoms often worsen over time, leading to poor health outcomes and high rates of healthcare 
utilization.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_86227] (ESI) with anti -inflammatory compounds such as glucocorticoids is 
commonly provided to alleviate pain from neurogenic claudication in spi[INVESTIGATOR_225165]: it is 
estimated that 25% of ESIs performed in the Medicare population and 74% of ESIs in the 
Veterans Affairs system are for spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078] [3,4]. However, one recent, large, multi -center, 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated no significant  benefit of epi[INVESTIGATOR_225166] [2]. In this study, Friedly et al. conducted a 
doubleblind, RCT comparing patient outcomes with epi[INVESTIGATOR_225167] (lidocaine) vs. anesthetic (lidocaine) only [5]. They observed no significant 
differences at [ADDRESS_270828] to pain -related functional 
disability or pain intensity. However, a subset of patients who received glucocorticoids plus 
lidocaine rep orted significantly higher treatment satisfaction and higher reductions in depressive 
symptoms [6]. This suggests that ESIs may be effective for a subset of patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_16071].   
Another treatment modality for spi[INVESTIGATOR_225168], which may be effective 
for some patients but is associated with higher risk especially in the elderly and patients with 
multiple medical comorbidities. In Davis et al.’s observational study, in a two -year period with 
68 patients, 32% of patients o pted for surgery, 44% of patients were satisfied with non -surgical 
management and were discharged after 2 years, but the remaining 24% with non -surgical 
management (some of whom chose to decline surgery) did not seem to be satisfied with 
treatment [7]. Thi s study indicates the potential key role that non -surgical management options 
such as ESIs may play, in some patients. However, better patient selection using indicators or 
biomarkers for patients who may most likely benefit from ESIs and other non -surgica l treatments 
would be extremely beneficial.  
In studying bio -markers that may predict patients’ response to ESIs, Scuderi et al. found 
interferon -gamma (IG) levels to have high predictive value for patients with lumbar nerve root 
irritation [8], while Go lish et al. and Smith et al. found fibronectin -aggrecan complex (FAC) 
levels to have high predictive value for patients with herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) [9, 10]. 
In addition, many other factors (such as lower age and higher education) have been found to 
predict better outcome for radiculopathy [11]. In particular, needle electromyography (EMG) has 
been shown in several studies to be a strong predictor for response to lumbar epi[INVESTIGATOR_225169] (LESI) and transforaminal epi[INVESTIGATOR_86227]  (TFESI) for patients with 
lumbosacral radiculopathy (LSR) [12 -14]. Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_225170], we would like to explore if 
certain bio -markers such as IG & FAC along with EMG findings can help us predict which 
patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_225171] c laudication will optimally benefit from ESIs.  
  
METHODS   
  
Subject Recruitment: Recruit 10 adults (who can read English and complete assessment 
instruments) referred to the UT Southwestern Spi[INVESTIGATOR_225172] 18 years or older with 
mildsevere lumbar central  canal stenosis identified by [CONTACT_19243] (MRI) or 
Computerized Tomography (CT) scan, who have symptoms consistent with neurogenic 
claudication such as pain, weakness, and/or numbness triggered by [CONTACT_225192].  Exclude patients with cognitive impairment; clinical co -morbidities 
interfering with data collection; severe vascular, pulmonary, or coronary artery disease that limits 
ambulation; spi[INVESTIGATOR_225173]; severe osteoporosis; metasta tic cancer; 
excessive alcohol consumption or evidence of non -prescribed or illegal drug use; pregnancy; 
concordant pain with internal rotation of the hip; active local or systemic infection; abnormal 
coagulation; allergy to local anesthetic, steroid, or co ntrast; previous lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477]; 
prisoners; epi[INVESTIGATOR_225174] 6 months; rheumatologic disorders such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.  
  
Study procedures: Once enrolled, all of t he patients will undergo routine sensory and motor 
nerve conduction studies with EMG and blood tests. Afterwards patients will be scheduled to 
undergo an ESI of steroid (dexamethasone) under fluoroscopic guidance at or below the level of 
the suspected path ology. Prior to the injection, a maximum of [ADDRESS_270829] procedure.  
Independent clinical variables will be assessed at three time points including at the initial visit, at 
1 month, and 2 months after the ESI. Additional measures used will include the pain disability 
questionnaire (PDQ), the Swiss Spi[INVESTIGATOR_225175] , and Numerical Rating Scale 
(NRS) for back and leg pain.

(hsCRPs).  Bio -Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27 -plex Assay, 1x96:  coupled magnetic beads,

eotaxin, basic FGF, G -CSF, GM -CSF, IFN -gamma, IP -10, MCP -1 (MCAF), MIP -1alpha, MIP -
1beta, PDGFBB, RANTES, TNF -alpha, VEGF.  
  
SPECIFIC AIMS & HYPOTHESES   
  
Specific Aim 1 : Identify biomarkers that can predict if patients will experience significant pain 
relief and/or improvement of quality of life following ESI, defined as minimum of 30% 
improvement in pain and/or PDQ scores.  
  
Hypothesis 1 : Since steroids relieve pain ma inly through anti -inflammatory effects, patients who 
have pain caused by [CONTACT_2898], should have certain associated inflammatory biomarkers in 
high concentration, which will predict their response to the steroid injection resulting in 
significant pain re lief. Patients who have pain not associated with inflammation, as indicated by 
[CONTACT_225193].  
  
Therefore, we hypothesize that patients, who have high levels of specific bio markers identified in 
their blood or epi[INVESTIGATOR_225176], will respond favorably to an ESI and experience significant pain 
and functional improvement following the ESI.  
  
Specific Aim 2 : Identify EMG findings of acute denervation that can predict pain relie f from 
ESI.  
  
Hypothesis 2 : EMG findings of acute denervation in leg and/or paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_225177]/markers of abnormal neural activities associated with pain and inflammation, and 
hence will predict pain and functional improvement from ESI in p atients with such EMG 
findings.   
  
Therefore, we hypothesize that patients, who have EMG findings of acute denervation in leg 
and/or paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_6845], will experience significant pain and functional improvement 
following the ESI.  
  
ANALYSIS PLAN:  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] [ADDRESS_270830] that is being planned to 
follow soon after.  
  
EXPECTED RESULTS AND RATIONALE:   
 Findings from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and data on specific biomarkers including blood tests, epi[INVESTIGATOR_225178]’ response to ESI will provide us with 
preliminary data to inform a fully powered clinical trial. Th us informed, this future RCT will be 
designed to scientifically evaluate patients’ long -term response to ESI, determine appropriate 
attribution to epi[INVESTIGATOR_158459], and refine our understanding of the predictive capabilities of 
biomarkers including blood tests, epi[INVESTIGATOR_225179]. Eventually, similar studies like this that seek to find biomarkers to predict s teroid 
effects on health management for a wide spectrum of human pathologies will help clinicians use 
steroids more selectively and effectively, and hence reduce healthcare utilization and unnecessary 
patient care, while optimizing their pain and function.

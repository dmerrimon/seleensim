BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION  
Prolonged periods of reduced activity are associated with decreased vascular function and muscle 
atrophy1-3.  Physical inactivity due to acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215420], 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715], and increased mortality.4 Older adults are a particularly  vulnerable population as 
functional (vascular and skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction) and structural deficits (loss in muscle mass leading to a reduction in strength) are a consequence of the agin g process .
5-[ADDRESS_259173], and p reserve vascular and skeletal muscle function across all the lifespan.  
 
The CDC recently stated the average length of a h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_215421] 4 -5 days, with older individuals 
(>65 yrs) staying marginally longer, [ADDRESS_259174] shown that short periods of limb immobilization (5 -7 days) have caused muscle atrophy with an 
accompanied loss of strength2, 10. Reducing activity by [CONTACT_215448] 75% have also shown small decreases in muscle mass, along with impairments in insulin sensitivity and 
increased inflam matory markers12. Furthermore, investigators have shown that sitting while being 
inactive for [ADDRESS_259175] that is responsible for combating oxidative stress in the body is the activation of NF -E2-
related factor 2 (Nrf2) . Activation of Nrf2 occurs when it is released from Keap1in the cytosol and 
translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2 promotes transcription of antioxidant enzymes.  
Protandim and PB125 are Nrf2 agonist supplements which  likely activate Nrf2. Protandim has been shown 
to activate Nrf2 and increase antioxidant enzyme expression during an oxidative challenge in human 
coronar y aortic endothelial cells22.  W e propose the use of non -specific antioxidants, mitochondria-
targeted antioxidants and a Nrf2 stimulator  to determine the impact of oxidative stress on physical 
inactivity.    
Exercise training and rehabilitation can be used as an alternative approach to combat the destructive 
effects of oxidative stress on aging and disease. An effective exercise training i ntervention can improve 
arterial compliance and vascular endothelial function23, 24.  Exercise training has been shown to alter the 
pro- and antioxidant balance resulting in improved endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms15, 25. 
Moreover, exercise training concomitantly improves musculoskel etal strength and function, 
cardiovascular function, body composition, blood chemistry (decreased triglyceride and cholesterol levels), and overall well- being
26-28.  NASA scientists developed an integrated resistance and  aerobic 
exercise program  during a strict [ADDRESS_259176] of physical inactivity . 
 
OBJECTIVES:  An experimental protocol has been designed to specifically evaluate the 
role of inactivity on functional (vascular and mitochondrial ) and structural (muscular) 
outcomes in young and old individuals.  
Specific aim 1:  Determine the impact of pre- training on functional (vascular and 
mitochondrial) and structural (muscular) outcomes before and after inactivity. Hypothesis: 
Pre-training (or prehabilitation) will increase the reserve  of participants as evidenced by [CONTACT_155666]  
(endothelial and mitochondrial ) and structural (muscular strength and size) improvements prior to 
inactivity.  Following inactivity, a higher level of function will be present in those individuals that 
performed pre -training.  It is expected that impro ved function will be associated with improved 
redox balance as a result of pre- training- induced increases in endogenous antioxidant capacity.  
Specific aim 2:   Determine the impact of exercise during a stint of inactivity on functional 
(vascular and mitocho ndrial) and structural (muscular) outcomes. Hypothesis: One to 
twenty days of exercise during a period of inactivity will minimize the decrements in functional 
(endothelial and mitochondrial function) and structural (muscular strength and size) outcomes 
evoked by [CONTACT_163151].  It is expected that the attenuated decline in function will be associated with 
improved redox balance as a result of exercise induced increases in endogenous antioxidant 
capacity.  
Specific aim 3:   Determine the impact of post -training on the recovery of functional 
(vascular and mitochondrial) and structural (muscular) outcomes following a period of 
inactivity. Hypothesis: Four to twelve weeks of post -training (or rehabilitation) following a period 
of inactivity will recover functional ( endothelial and mitochondrial function) and structural 
(muscular strength and size) measures lost during inactivity.  It is expected that the augmented 
recovery compared to baseline will be associated with improved redox balance as a result of 
exercise induced increases in endogenous antioxidant capacity.  
Specific aim 4:   Determine the contribution of oxidative stress in inactivity -induced losses 
in functional (vascular and mitochondrial) and structural (muscular) outcomes.  
Hypothesis:  Administration of a ntioxidants such as an oral antioxidant cocktail (vitamins C, E, 
alpha- lipoic acid), mitochondrial -targeted antioxidant (MitoQ), or a NrF2 agonist (Protandim 
and/or PB125) during inactivity will minimize the decrements in functional (endothelial and 
mitoch ondrial function) and structural (muscular strength and size) outcomes evoked by [CONTACT_163151].  
It is expected that the attenuated decline in function will be associated with improved redox 
balance as a result of free radical scavenging and/or increased endogenous antioxidant capacity.

reduced activity) and oxidative stress on functional and structu ral outcomes.  All procedures for 
the proposed protocol are strictly research- related.  
Pregnancy testing will be performed on all women of child bearing age and potential.  Any 
pregnant participants will be excluded from the study.  
STUDY PROCEDURES  
An overview of each visit to the laboratory, including chronology of the protocol, is listed 
on the following pages. This is followed by [CONTACT_215450], instrumentation, and the techniques and measurements identifi ed in the 
protocol.    
PRELIMINARY SCREENING AND BASELINE DATA COLLECTION (all participants, 1 -2 
hours/day)  
After obtaining informed consent, participants will report to the laboratory (VA Bldg 2, Room 1D21) 
for orientation, completion of medical history and activity questionnaires, and may have a medical 
examination performed by [CONTACT_57618]. A screening questionnaire will be filled out 
that will include questions concerning risks such as: age, family health history, smoking, 
hypertension, h ypercholesterolemia, and physical activity and allergies (iodine, latex, drugs, etc). 
A venous blood sample (4 ml) may be drawn from which a Metabolic Panel, Complete Blood 
Count (CBC), and a Lipid Panel will be assessed.  
Next, eligible participants may be asked to complete one or more of the following exercise tests : 
a graded exercise test to volitional exhaustion (bike or treadmill) with or without a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_215424], maximal and sub- maximal handgrip test, maximal and sub-
maximal leg extension test, and maximal and sub- maximal plantar flexi on test. Sufficient recovery 
will be allowed between tests, and ECG will be assessed at all times. The hand grip, leg extension, 
and plantar flexion graded exercise tests are considered low cardiovascular risk tests due to the 
recruitment of an isolated sm all muscle mass that results in minor cardiovascular stress. The 
graded whole- body exercise tests to volitional exhaustion (bike, treadmill), when performed in 
participants over the age of [ADDRESS_259177] (overt arrhythmia, severe [3 mm] ST segment depression, elevated [1mm] ST 
segment in non- Q wave lead, frequent extra- ventricular systoles) or adverse responses such as 
chest pain, leg pain, or unsteadiness will serve as criteria to stop the test, in accordance with 
American Heart Association guidelines. Questionable findings will be referred to a cardiologist for inspection/diagnosis prior to fur ther involvement in the protocol. Additionally cognitive 
assessment such as measuring the participant’s ability to follow basic instruction regarding exercise training and physical assessments such as a 6- minute walk test may be performed. 
Additionally, participants may be asked to wear an accelerometer to measure activity levels.  
If the participant is unable to complete the testing listed above additional visits may be scheduled 
to complete the testing.  
Following the exercise testing, participants may be given instruction and equipment for physical 
activity monitoring.  
Due to the nature of the testing performed under this protocol, we will not enroll pregnant women. 
Additionally, women of child- bearing age will be asked to undergo a urine pregnancy test pr ovided 
by [CONTACT_215451]. Additionally, these 
participants will be asked not to become pregnant while participating in this protocol. If a female 
participant becomes pregnant she will be asked t o inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_215425].   
EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL:  
Prior to reporting to the laboratory participants will be enrolled in one of the following modes of 
inactivity:   
• Bed Rest ( 1 - 10 days) performed at the University of Utah Center for Clinical and 
Translational Science (CCTS)  
• Limb Immobilization ( 1 - 21 days)  
• Reduced Activity ( 3 hours -  14 days)  
* Detail of each inactivity protocol is described below  
 
Participants may perform exercise training before (1 -6 weeks), during,  or after (4- 12 weeks)  
inactivity  (see Participant Instrumentation for more detailed description of exercise protocols).  
Participants may undergo a period of dietary supplementation (1 -20 days) by [CONTACT_215452] (PRO, 675mg/day) , PB125 (100- 200mg/day)  an antioxidant cocktail consisting of 
vitamins C (500mg), E (200IU) and alpha lipoic acid (300mg), or the mitochondrial targeted 
antioxidant Mito- Q (40 -80mg) before, during, or after inactivity for 1- 20 days.   
Participants may report to the following laborator ies (Utah Vascular Research Lab (UVRL) located 
at the VA Medical Center B ldg. [ADDRESS_259178], Rm 
360 or the University of Utah Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215426] , the Utah Center for 
Advanced Imaging Research (UCAIR) located at [ADDRESS_259179]., or the Skeletal Muscle 
Exercise Research Facility (SMERF) located in the Department of Physical Therapy at  [ADDRESS_259180] ) in a fasted state before, during, and after the inactivity protocols listed above. During 
these the following tests/evaluations may be performed:  
• Blood collection from an antecubital vein  
• Muscle biopsy from the gastrocnemius, soleus , or vastus lateralis.   
• Flow mediated dilation (FMD)  to asses s vascular function 
• Passive leg movement (PLM)  to asse ss vascular function 
• Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and continuous glucose monitoring 
• Exercise testing on a Humac Norm Isokinetic Extremi ty System .   
• Body composition assessed by [CONTACT_751] x -ray absorptiometry ( DEXA) scanner , magnetic 
resonance imaging ( MRI), or D3 creatine.   
• Assessment of oxygenated blood using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)  
• Catheters may be placed in the leg (common femoral artery , dorsalis pedis artery , 
posterior tibial artery, or femoral vein) or arm (brachial artery , radial artery , or antecubital 
vein) by a licensed physician using standard sterile technique.  
o Following the catheterization process endothelial cells  may be collected using a 
sterile J -wire (see Participant  Instrumentation for more detailed description of this 
procedure) by [CONTACT_215453].  
o Resting measurements of arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and limb blood flow 
(ultrasound Doppler) may be taken, and resting blood samples (arterial and venous) 
may be collected.  
• KE, plantar flexion, or handgrip exercise may be performed at several exercise intensities 
including, but not limited to, 25, 50, and 75% maximal work rate (WR max) or maximal 
voluntary contraction (MVC) as determined during preliminary testing. Each exercise intensity may be continued for up to 5 min to achieve steady -state pulmonary oxygen 
consumption. During each work bout the following sequence of events m ay be conducted:  
1) sampling of femoral arterial and venous blood for the direct measurement of free 
radicals and blood gases,  
2) continuous measurement of central hemodynamics (heart rate, stroke volume, 
cardiac output) and arterial and venous pressures (indw elling catheter pressure), 
and  
3) leg or arm blood flow via ultrasound Doppler.  
 
 
Inactivity Protocols:  
 
1) Bed Rest : After completion of pre -inactivity assessments, participants will adhere to bed rest 
lasting from [ADDRESS_259181] w ill be monitored by  [CONTACT_75462] 24 hours  
a day.   
2) Limb Immobilization:  After completion of the pre- inactivity assessments, parti cipants will 
adhere to unilateral leg immobilization which will be accomplished by a removable knee brace set 
at 60⁰ flexion (for 1 -  21 days). Crutch assisted locomotion will be utilized to minimize weight 
bearing of the immobilized leg. Unilateral limb immobilization for 14 days in humans provides an 
effective and feasible model to evoke significant structural and functional losses in response to 
unloading resulting in a  ~20% reduction in muscle strength, 10% reduction in exercise capacity, 
5-6% loss of leg lean masses, and 5 -10% decrease in fiber cross sectional area 32-35. 
3) Reduced Activity:  After completion of the pre-inactivity assessme nts, subjects will adhere to 
either short term (3 to 6 hours of sitting) or extended (1- 14-days ) of reduced physical activity at 
their home /work  as has been conduc ted before.12, 36 During  the short term protocol subjects will 
remain in the seated protocol with minimal to no movement of the lower extremities  as has been 
described previously.3, 11, 37, 38 During reduced activity, t he goal will be for the participant to drop 
their physical activity levels to 75% of their normal activity levels as determined by a monitor that 
the subject will be able to see and record. We will inform the participant that their normal diet 
should remain the same. A second step monitor will be taped to their leg (waterproof) for the 
investigators to assess the participants' compliance to the assigned step/day guidelines. For the 
extended protocols l ean mass, strength, power, and physical function measurements  will be re -
assessed on a later day following the reduced activity study.  
  
PARTICIPANT INSTRUMENTATION (alphabetical order)  
Antioxidant and blood measures: Ascorbic acid will be measured in the plasma by [CONTACT_47814] 
C assay kit (CosmoBio, Carlsbad, CA).  Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma will be determined 
according the spectrophotometric technique previously described 39. The FRAP method uses the 
ability of antioxidants to reduce a FE3+-TPTZ complex to its blue colored Fe2+ form. GSH, GSSG 
and Total Glutathione  will be measured using BioVision Glutathione Assay Kit (#K264 -100) (San 
Francisco, CA). Lipid hydroperoxides  will be assessed by [CONTACT_215454] (LPO) assay 
kit (Caymen, Ann Arbor, MI). Nitrite/Nitrate  levels will be measured in the plasma using a 
standard fluorometric assay kit (Caymen, AnnArbor, MI). 8-isoprostane, a marker of lipid 
perodixation and oxidative stress, will be analyzed in the plasma using Cell Biolabs 8- iso-PGF2α 
kit (#STA -337) (San Diego, CA).  
Antioxidant Cocktail: An antioxidant cocktail consisting of vitamins C (500mg), E (200IU ) and 
alpha lipoic acid (300mg)  will be consumed  daily for 1 -20 days . The PI’s and Co- I’s have 
previously utilized antioxidant cocktail supplementation in studies of both aging and disease when 
testing the ability of antioxidant supplementation to prevent free radical -mediated damage 40-45. 
Blood Draw: Blood draws will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Trinity or one of the other trained investigators 
in phlebotomy technique in our group  or by [CONTACT_215455] . In the rare case that this 
procedure is particularly difficult, as this is a standard procedure performed in our laboratory, the 
participant will be escort ed to the VA Medical Center's blood laboratory in an adjacent building 
where full -time phlebotomists will perform the blood draw.  
Body Composition: Dual X -ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) will be used to measure body 
composition (% body fat, % Lean Tissue, Bone Density) non -invasively. This test will be 
performed while lying on a padded bed while the low -level x -ray probe passes over the 
participant’s body (0.0004 cGy radiation exposure associated with the DEXA).  Body composition, 
specifically total body muscle m ass, may be determined by [CONTACT_215456] (methyl -d3) dilution 
method 46. This methods involves consumption of 30mg enriched creatine, provided in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_215427], and subsequent urine analysis of deuterated and unlabeled creatine  by [CONTACT_215457] .  
Catheterization: At each catheter insertion site, local anesthesia with lidocaine will be applied 
(1% lidocaine; 1 .33mg/kg assuming 75 kg body weight, with an upper limit of 10 ml). Sterile 
technique will be applied to minimize risk of infection. 1.0 mg of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_215428]. The leg (femoral artery and vein, 18G Cook Catheter  or equivalent) 
will be cannulated. A qualified and privileged physician will be responsible for the placement and 
removal of these catheters. Following catheter removal, wounds will be dressed and the 
participants educated as to proper care. Participants will not be released until hemostasis is 
clearly present. Follow -up contact [CONTACT_215458]. It 
should be noted that the Drs. Trinity, Richardson, Supi[INVESTIGATOR_215429] -related studies 47-56, having coordinated the use and insertion of these exact 
catheters hundreds of times in the last twenty y ears without incidence of bleeding, infection or 
tissue damage. In fact, several participants have performed multiple studies with our group, 
indicating the benign nature and positive outcome of the procedures.  
Central hemodynamics: Heart rate, stroke volu me, cardiac output, and mean arterial pressure 
will be determined non -invasively with a finometer (Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The 
Netherlands) positioned at heart level. The finometer uses beat by [CONTACT_215459] 
(Beatscope, version 1.1; Finapres Medical Systems), which in combination with heart rate has been documented to accurately estimate cardiac output during a variety of experimental protocols 
57, 58. This technique requires a blood pressure cuff be placed on the upper arm (biceps) and on 
the finger of the participant. Mean arterial blood pressure will also be measured by [CONTACT_215460] (Tango+, Suntech, North Carolina) at rest and during exercise.  
Continuous Glucose Monitoring: A commerciall y available continuous glucose monitor will be 
placed on the participant by [CONTACT_215461]. This device will record 24 hour 
glucose responses (including in response to meal intake) over the inactivity period.  
Diet Stabilization during Bed Rest: M etabolic variability will be reduced by [CONTACT_215462][INVESTIGATOR_4408]. Meals will be prepared by [CONTACT_215463] (dietician) using the Harris -Benedict equation to esti mate daily energy requirements, 
including adjustments for inactivity, and based on the information from a dietician- patient dietary 
interview, and the nutrient distribution recommended by [CONTACT_215464]. The 
absolute protein content of each meal will be calculated using the pre- bed rest body weight. 
Macronutrient intake will be evenly distributed between three meals, and uneaten food items will be recorded. Dietary data will be analyzed using The Food Processor softwar e program (Salem, 
Oregon).  
 Humac Norm Isokinetic Extremity System :  Isokinetic and isometric strength will be assessed 
in both legs through maximal voluntary contraction effort developed by [CONTACT_215465]/flexor (quadriceps/hamstrings) and plantar/dorsi flexor muscles on a CSMI Humac Norm dynamometer.  
 Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPRS)  Ex-vivo spin-trappi[INVESTIGATOR_215430] (190 
mM/L in 0.9% NaCl) will be utilized for the downstream detection of lipid- derived radical species 
in blood, as previously described 
59-61. We will use the spin -trap concentration of 3:1 ratio of whole 
blood- trap that has proved optimal in our previous studies. We will also use a series of ferrous 
iron-dithiocarbamate ligand spin- trap complexes to directly assess NO concentration in blood. 
Briefly, spin -trap adducts will be extracted from serum (or solute in the case of tissue) into toluene, 
vacuum degassed for 2 cycles and analyzed at 21°C using an EMX X -band EPR spectrometer 
fitted with an ER TM110 cavity (Bruker, Karlsr uhe, [LOCATION_013]). Spectrometer conditions will be as 
follows: 20mW experimentally validated non- saturating incident microwave power, 0.5 G 
modulation, 1 x 105 receiver gain, 82 msec time constant, 3450G magnetic field centre and ± 50G 
scan width, for 15 incremental scans. EPR spectral parameters will be obtained using 
commercially available software (Bruker Win EPR System, Version 2.11) and filtered identically. 
The average spectral peak -to-trough line height will be considered a measure.  
 
Endothelial Cell (E C) collection and protein expression:  The procedures for the collection of 
EC and measurement of endothelial protein expression have been previously described 62. Briefly, 
following the placement of an arterial (placed by a physician) or venous (placed by [CONTACT_215453]) 1 to 5 sterile J -wires are advanc ed through the catheter into 
the artery and/or vein (~4 cm beyond the tip of the catheter) and retracted through an 18 -gauge 
catheter by [CONTACT_215453], then transferred to a dissociation buffer solution, where ECs are recover ed by [CONTACT_215466]. Collection of ECs may 
be performed both before and after an acute intervention of exercise, inactivity, or dietary 
supplementation. EC protein expression will be determined according the method described by 
[CONTACT_215467] 2007 
62. Following EC collection, collected cells will be fixed with 3.7% formald ehyde 
and plated on poly -L-lysine coated slides (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, Mo). For 
immunofluorescence staining ECs will be rehydrated with PBS and nonspecific binding sites blocked with 5% donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, Pa). Afterward c ells will 
be incubated with monoclonal antibodies for one of the following: nitrotyrosine (Abcam; Cambridge, Mass), xanthine oxidase (US Biological; Swampscott, Mass), NAD(P)H oxidase-
p47phox (Abcam; Cambridge, Mass), CuZn SOD (Upstate; Lake Placid, NY), M n SOD (Research 
Diagnostics; Concord, Mass), catalase (Abcam; Cambridge, Mass) or NF -KB p65 (Novus; 
Littleton, Colo). Cells will next be incubated with CY3- conjugated secondary antibodies (Research 
Diagnostics; Concord, Mass). For analysis, slides will be viewed using a fluorescence microscope 
(Eclipse 600, Nikon, Melville, NY) and EC images will be digitally captured by a Photometrics 
CoolSNAPfx digital camera (Roper Scientific, Inc., Tucson, Ariz). ECs will be documented by [CONTACT_215468] (4',6' -
diamidino- 2-phenylindole hydrochloride) staining. Once endothelial cells with intact nuclei are 
identified, they will be analyzed using Metamorph Software (Universal Imaging Corp, 
Downingtow n, Pa) to quantify the intensity of CY3 staining (i.e. average pi[INVESTIGATOR_215431]). Values 
will be reported as ratios of EC protein expression/human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC); this 
minimizes the possible confounding effects of differences in intensity of stai ning among different 
staining sessions.  
 
Exercise Prescription during Limb Immobilization:  Total time for each exercise session 
includes allotted time for warm -up and cool -down before and after resistance and aerobic interval 
exercise training sessions.  
 
Pre and post inactivity exercise training (i.e.; prehabilitation and rehabilitation) :  The  
prehabilitation and rehabilitation interventions  mimic the cardiac rehabilitation program currently 
used by [CONTACT_215469]. Paul LaStayo (Co- Investigator, Physical Therapy) to optimize 
improvements in aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle strength.  The prehabilitation and 
rehabilitation intervention s will include the following:  
A. Initial Orientation:  
1) Preliminary questionnaires to assess diet, current physical activity, and psychosocial 
health (SF -12-Health Survey, PHQ -9 -Patient Health Questionnaire to assess depression, 
DASI -Duke Activity Status Index Score, and DRA -Dietary Risk Assessment)  
2) Interview with a registered nurse to review medications and past medical history.  
3) Cardiopulmonary physical therapy examination to assess readiness for exercise.  
4) Anthropometric measurements – waist circumfere nce, height, weight, body mass index 
calculation (BMI)  

5) Cycle ergometry test to assess exercise capacity and 10 repetition maximum testing to 
determine appropriate workloads for resistance exercises.  
6) Initial exercise prescription will be based on results of the cycle ergometry and 10 
repetition maximum tests.The personalized PREHAB exercise prescription plan is 
described below ( See 3. Exercise Prescription,  Performance, and Progression).  
 
B. Pre -exercise assessment:  
1) Weight is obtained from subject.  
2) Resting blood pressure and heart rate are obtained.  
3) Subjects’ telemetry is evaluated before, during, and after exercise.  
4) Proper warm -up exercises are taught, demonstrated, and performed.  
 
C. Exercise Prescription, Performance, and Progression:  
1) Subjects will perform PREHAB or REHAB 3 times per week for the duration of the 
intervention.  
2) The prescribed exercise is based on the individual’s baseline aerobic capacity and 
strength.  
3) Evaluations of aerobic capacity and strength will be assessed at [ADDRESS_259182] exercise intensities and maintain an adequate training stimulus. The 
exercise intensity for aerobic exercise will be set at predetermined work rates (watts) 
known to elicit a given % of VO 2max. The work rate verse VO [ADDRESS_259183] is not able to complete the prescribed 
number of repetitions the load will be maintained or decreased accordingly for the next 
session. Abbreviations: DB (dumbbell).  

 
D. Post -Exercise Assessment:  
1) Proper stretching exercises are taught, demonstrated, and performed.  
2) Subject rests for five minutes and post -exercise blood pressure and heart rate are 
obtained.  
 
E. Documentation of Exercise Sessions:  
1) All data collected during an exercise session is written on an intake sheet.  
2) All data is then entered into EPIC.  
 
F. Final Evaluation:  
At the completion of the prehabilitation and rehabilitation program, the subject will receive an 
exit interview to review the following:  
1) Preliminary and final tests are given to subject to evaluate outcomes.  
2) Subjects’ current exercise prescription  
3) Subjects’ anthropometric measurements  
4) Summary of the outcomes obtained by [CONTACT_215470].  
5) Note is forwarded to referring physician and Medical Director ([CONTACT_215500][INVESTIGATOR_5533]).  
   
Exercise Testing: Passive leg movement will be performed by a member of the research team 
moving the participant’s leg through a normal range of motion (90° - 180°).  
Single contraction exercise protocols will be performed with either the upper (handgrip) or lower (knee extension) extremity. A single maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) will be established for 
each participant using a handgrip or knee extension dynamometer
 with an analog output. This 
MVC value will be used to calculate 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% of MVC for the single 
contraction. Following a 2 min baseline period the participant will perform the rapid (< 1 sec) single 
contraction and central and peripheral hemodynamics will be assessed for [ADDRESS_259184] contraction.  
Active leg exercise will be performed using a c ustom -built knee -extensor ergometer with the 
participant moving the leg between 90° - 180° at a rate of approximately 60 rpm.  
Plantar flexion exercises will be performed using an ergometer specifically designed to isolate the 
gastrocnemius and the soleus c omplex at a rate of approximately 60 rpm.  
Handgrip exercise will be performed with the participant laying supi[INVESTIGATOR_215432]. The arm will be extended perpendicular to the participant’s 
torso and supported by a height -adjustable table. Doppler ultrasound will be performed by a 
trained sonographer in order to obtain brachial artery blood flow measurements. Exercise will be performed for [ADDRESS_259185]. Intensity 
will range from 10 to 60% of the participant’s maximal handgrip strength. During exercise ECG 
and blood pressure will be continuously monitored. Arm exercise will involve rhythmic handgrip 
using a computer -interfaced dynamometer.   
The graded exercise test will be performed on a cycle ergometer or treadmill using a conventional 
ramp test to exhaustion. Work rate/exercise intensity will be increased by [CONTACT_215471] 2.5- [ADDRESS_259186] breathing valve (Hans -
Rudolph 2700, dead space 90 ml) and a pneumotachometer (Fleisch no. 3) on the expi[INVESTIGATOR_215433]. Signals will be assimilated by a PC and O
2 and CO 2 analysis will be performed in real time 
(Parvo Medics, UT). All of this equipment is currently in place and has been used routinely in our 
laboratory with both healthy volunteers and patients. Throughout all our exercise testing, safety 
is en sured through careful echocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, availability of a defibrillator, an 
oxygen source, emergency drugs, and attendance of qualified personnel.  
Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD): After 15 -20 minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] a blood pressure cuff  
will be placed on the leg or forearm. Ultrasound images of the artery and Doppler waveforms will 
be obtained prior to cuff inflation (baseline). The cuff will then be inflated to 250mmHg for 5 
minutes. Following the cuff release, ultrasound images of the popliteal artery and Doppler 
waveforms will be recorded continuously for 2 minutes. During this time, arterial images during diastole will be captured by [CONTACT_215472] (Medical Imaging Applications). All recorded 
ultrasound images and velocity spectra segments will be saved to the GE Logiq [ADDRESS_259187] for 
off-line image and waveform analysis. The time averaged, and intensity -weighted mean blood 
velocity (Vmean) will be averaged across 5 second intervals for the entire 2 minute clip following 
cuff release. In addition, edge detecting software will be utilized to measure arterial diameter 
frame by [CONTACT_215473], which will also be averaged into 5 second intervals. Summed shear rate throughout the 2 minutes will be calculated based on vessel diameter and blood velocity. The 
maximum change in vessel diameter, relative to baseline, will be determined and expressed as 
%FMD and %FMD/summed shear rate. A greater FMD response is an indicator of healthier 
vessels. A typi[INVESTIGATOR_215434] a young healthy participants would be 8 -  12% or greater dilation, 
whereas a poor response would be <5%. In addition, it is also important to be able to express the change in diameter relative to shear stress, as the shear stress is the stimulus for the NO -induced 
dilation. Again, greater FMD/shear values are indicative of healthier vessels.  
Limb blood flow:  Blood flow will be measured with an ultrasound Doppler (Logiq  7, GE) 
equipped with linear array mechanical sector transducers operating at an imaging frequency of 10-[ADDRESS_259188] spatial resolution can be achieved. The blood velocity profile 
will be obtained using the same transducers with Doppler frequency of 4.0 -5.0 MHz, operated at 
high- pulsed repetition frequency mode (2 -25 kHz) with a depth of 1.5 -3.5cm. Special care will be 
taken to avoid aliasing, to ensure that probe position is stable, the insonation angle does not vary, and that the sample volume is positioned in the center of the vessel and adjusted to cover the 
width of the diameter and the blood velocity distribution. Blood velocity measuremen ts will be 
obtained with the probe at an appropriate angle to maintain an insonation angle of 60º or less and the sample volume centered. Using arterial diameter and mean velocity (Vmean), blood flow will 
be calculated as: Blood Flow (mL/min) = Vmean · π ·  (Vessel Diameter/2)2 · 60.  
MitoQ:  A mitochondrial targeted antioxidant supplement containing the antioxidant quinone 
moiety covalently attached to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation (TPP).  The TPP moiety 
on MitoQ  enables its accumulation within mitochondria driven by [CONTACT_215474].  Once within mitochondria, nearly all the accumulated MitoQ is adsorbed to the matrix 
surface of the inner membrane where it is continually recycled to the active quinol antioxidant form by [CONTACT_215475][INVESTIGATOR_35226].
63  Participants will consume 40- 80mg/day for 1- 20 
days  as previously described.64, 65 
Muscle biopsies:  All biopsies will be taken from either the gastrocnemius approximately 3.[ADDRESS_259189] of gastrocnemius muscle belly 10 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity or 
the vastus lateralis approximately 3.5 cm deep, 15 cm proximal to the knee and s lightly distal to 
the ventral mid- line of the muscle.  The 5 mm diameter biopsy needle (Bergstrom) is attached to 
sterile tubing and a syringe to apply a negative pressure to assist in the muscle sample collection 
66. Lidocaine (2%) will be used as local anesthetic. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_215435] 100 of these procedures with no negative outcomes. Additionally, in support of this 
technique, a series of subjects recently underwent 5 biopsies each over a period of time, 
illustrating that the biopsy experience is acceptable to the subjects.  The muscle samples from 
each biopsy will be immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80oC for future microscopy, 
EPR spectroscopy, molecular and biochemical assays or immersion- fixed in gluteraldehyde for 
EM analysis. With our current technique and experience, utilizing 2 -3 passes of the needle and 
double cut, we are able to attain as much as 300- 400 mg of muscle which will permit the 
performance of all proposed analyses.  
Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests (OGTT):  This is a standard clinical procedure to determine the 
blood glucose and insulin responses to a standardized glucose challenge. This takes 
approximately 2 hours. Glucola, a sugary beverage containing 75g of glucose, will be 
administered orally over 2 to 5 minutes. Blood samples from an intravenous catheter will be 
determined before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after Glucola consumpti on. Approximately 5 
mls of blood will be collected during the OGTT.    
Passive Leg Movement (PLM):  Participants are moved into an upright sitting position for ∼10 
min before the start of the data collection and remain in this position throughout the entire protocol. 
The protocol consists of 60- s of resting baseline data acquisition followed by a 2- min bout of 
passive leg extension. PLM is achieved by a member of the research team moving the 
participant's lower leg through a range of motion, defined by 90° and 180° knee joint angles, at a 
rate of [ADDRESS_259190] with leg movement. To avoid a startle reflex and active resistance to 
the PLM, participants are made aware that the assessment will start in the next minute, but to 
minimize the chance of an anticipatory response, they are not informed of exactly when 
movement will begin 122.  There are no known risks of this procedure.  
PB125:   The product PB125 (Pathways Bioscience, Aurora, CO) to be used in this study contains 
extracts derived from three botanical sources: Rosmarinus officinalis , standardized to carnosol 
content of 6%, 68mg of extract; Withania somnifera  (aka Ashwagandha), st andardized to 
withaferin A content of 1%, 23mg of extract; and Sophora Japonica , standardized to luteolin 
content of 98%, 9mg of extract, to create a total daily dosage of 100mg of combined extracts 
administered in a single capsule administered up to twice daily (i.e. 100- 200mg/day) . Other 
inactive ingredients consist of rice flour and hydroxypropyl cellulose (vegetarian capsule).  PB125 
meets or exceed GMP quality standards.  The product does not contain gelatin, dairy, yeast, 
wheat, or gluten.  
Physical Ac tivity Assessment:  Physical activity of the participant may be assessed by 
[CONTACT_215476] (i.e. activity monitor) and/or physical activity questionnaire.  With accelerometry, participants will be asked to wear a small activity tracker attached to a belt fastened around their 
arm, leg, or waist for approximately 7 days.  These activity trackers (Actigraph, Actilife, [LOCATION_003]) 
simply record the number of steps a person takes each day, and the amount of movement a 
person makes each day.  Participants may als o be asked to complete a physical activity 
questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire, IPAQ) or IPAQ for Elderly123.  These short questionnaires simply assess how many minutes per day an individual performs physical 
activity.  
Protandim:  A nutritional supplement comprised of five plant extracts (milk thistle, bacopa, 
ashwagandha root, turmeric, green tea) that activates the Nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2) -like 
2, (called Nrf2) transcription factor pathway that is integral to several antioxidant enzymes, including γ -glutamyl cysteine synthase (an enzyme that catalyzes the committed step in 
glutathione synthesis) .
67 Nuclear factor (erythroid- derived 2) -like [ADDRESS_259191] 
oxidative damage triggered by [CONTACT_215477].  Participants will consume 675mg/day  for 
1-20 days  as previously described.68 
DATA SAFETY & MONITORING  
In the interest of participant safety and to ensure compliance with IRB and FDA regulations, we 
propose the implementation of a data safety and monitoring group. Four Utah Vascular Research Laboratory faculty members (Drs. Trinity, Richardson, Wray, and Amann), an internal sub -
investigator (Mark Supi[INVESTIGATOR_5533], M.D.), four members external to the UVRL: [CONTACT_215501] and Micah Drummond, Ph.D., Dorothea Rosenberger, M.D., J acob Jessop, M.D. and Lisette Perez and 
Shelby [CONTACT_215478], coordinator s for the DSMB will make up the monitoring group, all of whom are 
affiliated with the University and the SLC VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center. 
These members will meet on a quarterly basis, and additionally will convene in response to any 
adverse events or unanticipated problems associated with the proposed studies.  
All participants participate on a strictly voluntary basis, and thus any protocol may be stopped at 
any time and for any reason at the participant’s request. Additional criteria to discontinue a 
protocol will be any evidence that the participant’s health is at risk, as identified by a member of 
the investigative team. Participant safety is at the forefront of all s tudies, and for this reason all 
investigators are trained to identify overt (i.e. abnormal ECG patterns, acute change in blood 
pressure, etc.) and more subtle (i.e. skin pallor or redness, changes in participant demeanor, etc.) 
signs that a participant may  be adversely affected by [CONTACT_215479].  Adverse 
events and unanticipated problems are broadly defined as any instance of a medical complication arising from catheter insertion (i.e. excessive bleeding and swelling at insertion site) or drug 
infusion (i.e. acute hypertension, bradycardia, etc.) as listed under the “potential risks” section 
below. In the instance of an adverse event, the protocol will be discontinued and the study will be 
temporarily suspended while DS&M members will review  the cause of the event. When 
appropriate, unanticipated adverse events will be reported within 10 working days, in accordance 
with the University of Utah IRB Reporting Policy and to any other pertinent regulatory body(ies).  
 
POTENTIAL RISKS  
Due to the nature of the testing performed under this protocol, we will not enroll pregnant women. 
Additionally, women of child- bearing age will be asked to undergo a urine pregnancy test provided 
by [CONTACT_215451]. Additionally, these 
participants will be asked not to become pregnant while participating in this protocol. If a female 
participant becomes pregnant she will be asked to inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_215425].   
Bed Rest R isks: Bed rest will be performed at the University of Utah CCTS with around -the-clock 
medical supervision by [CONTACT_185535]. To ensure safety and comfort during the [ADDRESS_259192] we will follow our established guidelines presented below:  
• A slight bed- back elevation will be permitted and subjects may raise their shoulders with two 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151].  
• Subjects will be encouraged to change position periodically to alleviate positional 
discomfort and to eat.  
• Serial compression devices and compression stockings will be worn to decrease DVT risk.  
• Physical therapy will be provided daily to reflect standard of care for bedridden individuals. It will include passive range of motion to lower extremity major joints i n all planes (~10 
repetitions/plane)  
• Bathing and hygiene activities will be performed during bed rest.   
• A bedside wheelchair will be provided to transport to the bathroom for urine excretion and 
bowel movements.  
• Daily safety blood draws (D -dimer, complete blood count with platelet count and auto -
differential, partial thromboplastin time, prothombin time).  
• 24h nursing supervision and care and medical oversight by [CONTACT_215480] (Co- I: Mark 
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_5533], MD)  
 
Following the bed rest period, participants will be im mediately evaluated by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_215436] (CCTS). We have observed that after [ADDRESS_259193] on leg lean mass and 
afterwards visit the SMERF laboratory for knee extensor leg strength assessment as outlined in 
the experimental timeline.  
 Limb Immobilization Risks:  Limb immobilization is an established model of inactivity resulting in 
significant muscle atrophy (~4 -5%) and losses in muscle strength (~20%) and exercise capacity 
(~10%). During limb immobilization participants will remain ambulatory by [CONTACT_215481].  
Participants will be instructed on proper use of crutches by [CONTACT_215482][INVESTIGATOR_215437]. During limb immobilization there is an increased risk of deep 
vein thrombo sis. To minimize this risk periodic bl ood draws (every 3
rd day) during limb 
immobilization will be performed and assessed for D -dimer, complete blood count with platelet 
count and auto- differential, partial thromboplastin time, prothombin time . Additionally, participants 
will be instructed to perform unweighted hip, knee, and ankle contractions at least twice daily to 
activate the muscle pump and further minimize the risk of DVT. Approximately 10 contractions at 
each joint will be performed. If advised by [CONTACT_215483].  
Myocardial ischemia, infarction, arrhythmia, and death during exercise. These risks will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_215484]- screening and non -invasive testing of each participant. If problems 
are found the parti cipant will be excluded and referred to his/her physician. The responses to 
absolute and relative indications for the termination of an exercise test are variable depending 
upon the finding. However, an incident of ischemia presented as chest pain, shortness of breath, 
acute hypotension (<80/40 mmHg), or abnormal ECG findings (>[ADDRESS_259194] depression or 
appearance of S 3 or S 4 heart sounds) would result in the immediate termination of exercise. The 
participant would be placed in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], administered  oxygen and assessed by [CONTACT_21639] -
site physician and research staff. If the condition did not improve or worsened 911 would be called. In all cases this occurrence would be documented and the participant would ultimately be referred 
to their physician. Cardiac function will be monitored during all exercise studies with an ECG 
monitor.  
Biopsy risks:  Using sterile technique and a minimal skin incision (about 1/8”) over the anterolateral 
mid-thigh, the standard needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_215438]. There is the possibility of a small scar the size of the incision 
(1/8”).  No subject is released until hemostasis has been secured, and the skin site dressed.  
Subjects are always carefully instructed  in the routine prevention of infection and bleeding of 
biopsy sites . As lidocaine is used as the anesthetic there is the risk of toxicity, however the low 
concentration 0.5% and the use of less than 10- 15 ml greatly reduces this concern. Though 
multiple biopsy procedures create additional sites which may be prone to infecti on, as outlined 
above the technique employed minimizes this risk. Nonetheless, on protocols where multiple 
biopsies are performed, special care will be taken with the sterile dressing and bandaging to 
further minimize risk of infection. Further, the small quantity required for each sample (300- 400 
mg) is such that attaining multiple biopsies in one visit is not viewed as presenting a compound 
risk in terms of muscle damage and healing.   
Additionally, nerve injury including paresthesia or motor deficits could occur that could be 
permanent, and chronic muscle atrophy or possibly permanent pain could occur at the biopsy 
site. If an infection occurs post biopsy, antibiotics or even surgery to repair infection damage may 
be necessary.   
Catheter -related risks . There is also the possibility of fainting, dizziness, and possible pain and 
bruising as a result of catheter insertion. There is a risk of infection, swelling, and discomfort at the insertion sites, and a risk that bleeding may occur after cathet ers removal. A clot or excessive 
bleeding at the puncture site could result in a partial blockage of the blood flow to the leg, which in extreme cases could lead to loss of the limb. Based on the fact that two arteries supply the 
hand versus only one arter y supplies the leg, femoral arterial catheterization bears a greater risk 
to the participants' health. Accordingly, the participants will be allowed to select the site of the 
arterial catheterization, the choices are either femoral or radial artery. These risks are minimized 
by [CONTACT_215485], catheter insertion by a physician with experience using proper equipment and sterile methods, a continuous infusion of fluids thorough the catheters, adequate 
pressure for >30 minutes following catheter rem oval, and appropriate patient education and 
follow- up. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_215439] -I’s named herein have significant cumulative experience in this 
areas, having been involved in several hundred successful catheter -based studies with no 
instances of bleeding, inf ection, femoral vein thrombosis or soft tissue damage as a result of the 
procedures proposed.  
Pregnancy risks:   Due to the fact that little is known about how these procedures will affect a fetus, 
we cannot allow pregnant women to participate. If you are a  female of child -bearing age, you will 
be asked to undergo a urine pregnancy test provided by [CONTACT_215486]. Acceptable methods of birth control include oral/topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/injected 
contraceptives, intra- uterine devices, and barrier methods. If you become pregnant while taking 
part in the study, you must immediately tell your research doctor and you will be withdrawn from the study. We will follow the outcome of your pregnancy and we will continue to follow you 
according to the study plan.  
Exercise Risks : There is elevated risk for injury or cardiovascular events during exercise. 
However, the laboratory’s significant amount of work with exercise in healthy, diseased, and aged 
populations over the past [ADDRESS_259195] supervision in a controlled environment (please refer to following section pertaining to 
protection against r isk during exercise protocols).  
 
Radiation Risks DEXA Scan: This research study involves up to [ADDRESS_259196] important issue is prevention of the above ri sks by [CONTACT_215487]- screening, 
by [CONTACT_215488] (see methods 
section), and by [CONTACT_215489] -study patient education and follow -up of catheter site care.  For all 
protocols, ECG activi ty and arterial blood pressure are monitored by [CONTACT_215490].  Both this observer and the participant have absolute authority to 
terminate a study at any time. Participant confidentiality is ensured by t he coding of all personal 
information and the maintenance of all records and samples within a locked structure accessible 
only to key personnel involved in the research study.  Furthermore, during the exercise, RPEs will 
be obtained from the participants at the end of each stage. This includes evaluation of a) overall 
feeling, b) leg discomfort, and c) dyspnea. The laboratory is equipped with a fully stocked 
resuscitation cart that includes bag/mask ventilation equipment, intubation equipment, suction 
equipment, electrical defibrillator  an O 2 source and resuscitation drugs including naloxone. In the 
event of symptoms or signs of an adverse cardiopulmonary event – anginal symptoms, extreme 
dyspnea, dizziness, pre -syncope or frank syncope, severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], decrease in S pO2 
below 90%, tachydysrythmia – exercise will be ceased immediately, with institution of evaluation 
and management according to ACLS protocol (maintenance of airway, supplemental O 2, 
ventilatory assistance if necessary, electrical cardioversion or defibrillation if necessary). If the 
participant requires cardiopulmonary resuscitation or further medical therapy, they will be 
immediately transport ed to the Emergency Department.  
 
STATISTICAL METHODS, DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION:  
A total of [ADDRESS_259197] been developed in collaboration with the Study Design & 
Biostatistics Center at the University of Ut ah. We focus on well -powered testing of the primary 
hypotheses while minimizing subject burden and study costs. Descriptive summaries will be provided for each outcome prior to initiating formal statistical analyses. Transformations may be 
sought for outcomes exhibiting substanti al skewness to better approximate normality. If 
approximate normality cannot be achieved following transformation, rank -based non- parametric 
analyses (such as Wilcoxon rank -sum test) will be substituted for parametric analyses.  
Comparisons between conditions (ie; inactivity verse activity, placebo verse intervention, trained 
verse untrained) may be made prior to, during, and after the inactivity intervention.  No baseline 
group differences are expected while significant improvements in vascular and mitochond rial 
function are expected prior to inactivity in those participants undergoing exercise training. During 
inactivity , measures of vascular and skeletal muscle function are expected to decline. Rates of 
decline are expected to be attenuated when an interven tion such as exercise training or 
antioxidant supplementation (MitoQ, Protandim,  PB125,  Oral Antioxidant) is administered.  A rich 
set of measures will be obtained from biopsied muscle, blood samples, and measures of strength, 
lean mass, and aerobic capacit y before and after the intervention for each group. These 
comparisons with different outcome measures will be considered secondary or supportive 
analyses. For the formal test of the hypotheses we will use analysis of covariance (as 
implemented SAS PROC GLM ) with the final vascular and mitochondrial function assessments 
as the dependent variable and baseline as independent variables as suggested by [CONTACT_215491] 69. We will also include age and gender as independent variables in the model. Similar 
models will be constructed for secondary or supportive analyses listed above.  
Clinical Records:  Patient demographics (DOB, gender, height, weight), past medical history, 
medication use, and results of cardiovascular tests (echocardiogram, catheterization, stress test) 
will be collected.  
The following procedures are in place in the Vascular Laborator y to assure safety of 
research participants:  
1. Properly trained research personnel will monitor all exercises to ensure they are 
performed correctly.  
2. Individuals performing blood draws are familiar with all disease transmission 
safeguards and emergency procedures, should a problem arise.  
3. Blood pressure cuffs will only be inflated to obtain the necessary measurements, and 
will be deflated immediately afterwards.  
4. Immediate emergency –  call 911, as typi[INVESTIGATOR_215440].  
5. A crash cart and defibrillator are maintained in the laboratory.  
 
The following procedures are in place in the Vascular Laboratory to protect sensitive 
participant information:  
1. The laborato ry is kept locked when there are no lab personnel present.  
2. The Logic [ADDRESS_259198].  
5. Each participant will be identified by [CONTACT_63903]. These numbers will be used in a 
statistical spreadsheet while all statistical analyses are performed. The maximal length 
of storing this information is 5 years, upon which it will be destroyed.  
 
ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES :  
Facilities and Equipment  
Utah Vascular  Research Laboratory  (UVRL) : The PI, [CONTACT_215502], is a member of the UVRL, 
a consortium that is affiliated with the University of Utah (Department of Internal Medicine) and 
housed at the Salt Lake City Veterans Administration Medical Center Geriatrics, Research, 
Education and Cli nical Center (SLC VAMC GRECC). At pr esent, the UVRL includes [ADDRESS_259199] trainees in the performance of various 
assays including the biochemical analysis of free radicals and their footprints. Additionally, two 
full-time research study coordinators are responsible for scheduling and recruiting subjects and 
maintaining compliance with the University and VA Institutional Review Boards.  
 Research performed in the UVRL  revolves around the link between vascular and skeletal muscle 
function. Specifically, faculty of the UVRL, are interested in the mechanisms that appear to limit 
skeletal muscle function as the result of healthy aging and age- related disease including hear t 
failure, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One of the many potential 
candidates upon which we are currently focusing considerable attention is the role of oxidative 
stress in the regulation/dysregulation of skeletal muscle metaboli sm and vascular control.  The 
UVRL  consists of [ADDRESS_259200] in the human based 
laboratories while chemical analysis including electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, 
molecular biology, and biochemistry will be performed in 1 of the 3 wetlabs.  
 Skeletal Muscle Exercise Research Facility (SMERF):  Drs. Paul LaStayo and Micah 
Drummond (Sub- investigator’s) Co- Direct the SMERF, a clinical research training environment 
focused on the interrelationship of impaired muscle strength/power and activation; and mobility/gait disorders and falls. Current research performed at the SMERF is focused on aging 
muscle and how it impacts movement and human performance; specifically how aging muscles 
adapt and how these changes help or hinder human function in dail y life and following injury or 
disease.  The SMERF , a compi[INVESTIGATOR_215441] [ADDRESS_259201] floor in 
the College of Health’s Department of Physical Therapy and Athletic Training.  Previous and 
current clinical trials designed to evaluate muscle countermeasures and commensurate muscle, 
mobility and quality of life endpoints have been suc cessfully performed in the SMERF across a 
variety of older individuals and clinical populations . The SMERF is  located on the University of 
Utah campus yet away  from busy day -to-day traffic . Therefore, it is easily accessed by [CONTACT_128646], bus 
or via the free ParaTrans system; there is ample free parking and an accessible entrance to both 
facilities for those who are mobility impaired.  The SMERF houses standard muscle  and mobility  
training equipment as well as measurement lab stations for assessing muscle structure/ function 
and analyses of mobility/activity performance. The proposed assessments of muscle strength will 
take place at the SMERF.  
 
Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) : The proposed project will utilize the 
several services provided by [CONTACT_215492]. Briefly, the CCTS will provide [ADDRESS_259202]. Moreover, assessment of body composition via 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), muscle biopsies, and venous blood collections will be 
performed by [CONTACT_215455]. Members of the investigative team (Trinity, Drummond, 
LaStayo, Supi[INVESTIGATOR_5533]) have successfully performed and are currently  performing several bed rest 
studies at the CCTS.  
 
University Center for Advanced Imaging Research (UCAIR):  For studies involving NMR and 
MRI,  we will collaborate with UCAIR. This center consists of a 7000 sq. ft. of office, class room 
and laboratory space  located in the Center for Advanced Medical Technologies (CAMT) at 
Arapeen Drive in Research Park. Linux and SUN workstations, computer terminals, PCs and 
MacIntosh computers are available throughout the lab. The lab contains an electronics shop fully 
equipped with oscilloscopes, signal generators, and other essential test and measurement 
equipment with bench space and various equipment for electronic fabrication and testing, a small machine shop, and wet -lab space with fume hood in addition to a full stock  of electronic parts, 
manuals, and data books. UCAIR also has a coil lab, equipped with an HP 8752A network 
analyzer, a HP 4193A vector impedance meter, and a full size test bore/RF shield to simulate the 
MRI electrical environment. The School of Medicine machine shop is located in the CAMT building 
and is fully equipped and available for major machining projects. There is approximately [ADDRESS_259203] actively shielded water cooled Sonata gradient systems (40 mT/m amplitude, 
200 T/m/s slew rate), 32 high speed RF receiver channels and RF body coil, head coil and sev eral 
coils of variable numbers of elements designed for specific body parts. Custom coils for unique 
geometries may be designed and fabricated in the coil development lab (above). The systems 
are also equipped with pulse sequences and appropriate software for cardiac imaging, 
spectroscopy, functional MRI, diffusion tensor MRI and other high end imaging capabilities. A 
highly flexible pulse sequence development platform (IDEA) is also included to allow research and development in novel techniques. We have a research agreement and research support from 
Siemens and collaborate with them.  
 
Personnel  
All investigators of this study have extensive experience with each of the techniques described in 
the proposal.  
 
Recruitment & Participant Compensation    
Participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_215493] . Recruitment 
strategies will include recruitment fliers (VAMC SLC and University of Utah), VA and University 
patient databases, newspaper advertisements, clinic visits for rec ruitment with the approval of the 
candidate’s MD, word of mouth. A formal analysis of electronic medical records using appropriate 
ICD-[ADDRESS_259204] in the study or  chose not to opt -out from 
further communication will be called by a member of  the research recruitment team.   
Participant compensation:  
• Preliminary testing and screening: Participants will receive $20/hour  compensation per 
visit. 
• Bed rest protocol: $150 per/day of bed rest  
• Limb immobilization protocol:  $60 per day of limb immobilization  
• Reduced activity Protocol : $50 per day of reduced  activity  
• Exercise training session performed before, during or after inactivity: $20 per  session.  
Communication Plans for Multi -Center Studies (i.e. multiple sites around the nation):  N/A. 
 
Participating Sites outside the University of Utah (i.e. multiple sites around the city or 
state): N/A. 
 
Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  
Per 21 CFR 312.57, Investigator rec ords shall be maintained for a period of 2 years following 
the date a marketing application is approved; or, if no application is filed or the application is not 
approved, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and the FDA is notified.    
VA Records Retention:  
The VA does not have included in their record control schedule a timeframe for the destruction 
of research records, as a result, we cannot destroy anything right now and need to ask if it is 
indicated in the application or supporting documents that records , including identifiers, will be 
destroyed within a specific timeframe that this timeframe be changed to "in accordance with the 
VA record control schedule."  
Protocol Deviation:  
A protocol deviation (or violation) is any departure from the defined procedures and 
treatment plans as outlined in the protocol version submitted and previously approved by [CONTACT_5040]. Protocol deviations have the potential to place participants at risk and can also 
undermine the scientific integrity of the study thus jeopardizing the justification for the 
research.   Protocol deviations are unplanned and unintentional events.  
 
Because some protocol deviations pose no conceivable threat to participant safety or 
scientific integrity, reporting is left to the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_215442]. The IRB requires the prompt reporting  of protocol deviations which 
are: 
• Exceptions to eligibility criteria.  
• Intended to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant or  
• Harmful (caused harm to participants or others, or place them at increased 
risk of harm -  including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm), or  
• Possible serious or continued noncompliance  
 
Protocol violations/deviations will be summarized in the FDA Annual IND Report or if safety 
issues arise they may be reported earlier.  
Prompt reporting for VA research is 5 business days upon becoming aware of a reportable 
problem, event, or deviation.  Unanticipated Problems (including Adverse Events)  
• The VA does not use the OHRP term of an unanticipated problem involving risks to 
participants or others.  However, the VA uses criter ia for reporting problems and events that 
are nearly exact when compared to the criteria for an unanticipated problem involving risks 
to participants or others, which is used by [CONTACT_195053].  Thus, investigators 
conducting VA research should follow the standard Unanticipated Problem criteria for 
evaluating and reporting problems and events.  
• The investigator must notify the IRB same- day by [CONTACT_215494] -related deaths that are unanticipated.  Send notificati on, including the IRB 
number, to: [EMAIL_4215].  The investigator must then submit a Report Form within 5 
business days.    
• Investigators must take care in documenting appropriate evaluation of unanticipated 
problems.  Unfounded classification of problems as unrelated or anticipated must be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_215495] -compliance.  
 
Protocol Amendments:  
Any amendments or administrative changes in the research protocol during the period, 
for which the IRB approval has already been given,  will not be initiated without 
submission of an amendment for IRB review and approval.    All amendments that 
significantly affects the patient safety will be submitted to the FDA for review per [ADDRESS_259205] prevent any immediate action 
from being taken by [CONTACT_215496].

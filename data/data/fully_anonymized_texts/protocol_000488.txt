Neuraminidase inhibition as a novel treatment to improve endothelial function in 
type 2 diabetes (T2D)  
 The endothelial glycocalyx is a thin layer of interwoven glycoproteins and proteoglycans that forms a luminal mesh separating the vascular wall from the flow of blood. One of the glycocalyx’s primary functions is to serve as a mechanosensor of shear stress in flow-
mediated dilation ( FMD ).
78, [ADDRESS_1131867] the in vivo effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibition with zanamivir on improving endothelial function in diabetes, we treated T2D mice with zanamivir for five 
days, which is the treatment regimen approved for influenza. Results indicate that treatment with zanamivir reduced plasma neuraminidase activity  and improved 
endothelial function. On the basis of these exciting results, we are taking a fully 
translational approach and will determine the capacity of a five -day treatment with 
zanamiv ir to improve endothelial function in T2D human subjects in a clinical trial.  
The objective is to determine if neuraminidase inhibition with zanamivir  is efficacious as 
a therapeutic strategy to restore endothelial function in T2D patients.  
Twenty  subjects will complete five  days of treatment with zanamivir. Baseline 
measurements will be taken before the initiation of tr eatment , as well as a fter the I. Research Objectives/Background  
Page 2 of 11  conclusion of the treatment period ( i.e., a total of two  assessment  visits per subject ). 
Assessment visits will include: vitals  (such as blood pressure, heart rate), fasting blood 
work for  plasma neuraminidase activity, plasma sialic acid, plasma glucose and plasma 
insulin,  brachial artery FMD, and glycocalyx integrity assessment via Glycocheck.  
 
 
 
 
Drug treatment, dose, route and regimen:  
Subjects will be treated with 10mg zanamivir twice a day for five  days (same dose 
currently  FDA-approved for influenza treatment ). Zanamivir will be administered via oral 
inhalation. [CONTACT_231891], MD (co- investigator) and [CONTACT_817427], MD ( safety 
officer ) will oversee the trial. 
Rationale for choosing the drug and dose:  
As stated above, the proposed dose and administration route of zanamivir for this study 
are the same as the dose and administration route currently approved by [CONTACT_817414]. Zanamivir was chosen from the four currently approved neuraminidase inhibitors because of its  highest IC50 for mammalian neuraminidases.  
Risks and safety information  
Per Relenza (zanamivir) packaging insert:  
- Medication will not be administered in patients with a history of allergic reaction to 
any ingredients in the medication, including lactose (which contains milk proteins).  
- Most common adverse events are : sinusitis, dizziness (in treatment studies) and 
fever and/or chills, arthralgia, and articular rheumatism (in prophylaxis studies). Zanamivir will not be administered until two  weeks following administration of live 
attenuated influenza vaccine and the live attenuated influenza vaccine should not be given until 48 hours following cessation of zanamivir.  
- Zanamivir also carries warnings/precautions for: bronchospasm, allergic reaction, 
neuropsychiatric events . 
IND: 
An Investigational New Drug (IND) is not included as part of this protocol because the study medication, zanamivir is being used at an FDA approved dose in a population that is not anticipated to have increased risk or decreased acceptability of risk. Furt hermore,  
individual s who have COPD or asthma will be excluded from the trial as these 
conditions may increase risk of adverse events.  Lastly, no information will be submitted 
to the FDA to support a labeling indication, a labeling change, or a change in advertising, as this is not the intent of the current study.

Patients with T2D (n= 20) will be recruited from the MU Cosmopolitan Diabetes Center, 
MU Department of Medicine clinics, and the Columbia community by [CONTACT_37152].  
MU Health Care's electronic medical record has informatics tools and databases used for developi[INVESTIGATOR_673420], including i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) and RedCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). As in prior studies, wi th IRB 
approval, we contact [CONTACT_817415].  
Recruitment:   
Subjects will be recruited from the University of Missouri -Columbia as well as the local 
community by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Manrique and our research team.  
1. A chart review of clinic patients from the Division of Endocrinology, the Department of Medicine, and the Department of Medicine, and the Department of Family Medicine who are between the ages of [ADDRESS_1131868] been 
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes will be completed in Powerchart by [CONTACT_2420]/staff based on the study inclusion/exclusion criteria.  A letter, chart message, or phone call will be utilized to notifying them of their eligibility to partici pate in a research study.  Study coordinator/st aff will work in conjunction 
with healthcare providers that have a direct patient care relationship to recruit subjects from clinics.  If patients indicate an interest in the study after they are 
initially contact[CONTACT_38435], they will be sent a follow up email with a Qualtrics screening link and more details about the study.   
2. Subjects may respond to the recruitment flyers, word of mouth, or advertisements posted in MU Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_251028], MU Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_817408], MU Info, or any place generally accessible to the public (i.e., grocery stores, community centers, newspapers, F acebook, etc.). Only recruitment materials 
approved by [CONTACT_817416]. For all recruitment, subjects will be given an email address and/or a phone number to contact. After email or phone contact [CONTACT_204278], subjects will be given a link to complete a screening questionnaire 
via Qualtrics: (https://missouri.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2truBrLOYWemj3g).  
3. Subjects may also be identified and contact[CONTACT_817417]. (Studykik will be provided with copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099] -approved recruitment materials to post)  
 
 
   
Preliminary screening  
As part of preliminary screening, all individuals who are interested in participating in the research study will be required to complete a screening questionnaire (via Qulatrics or phone) to determine preliminary eligibility before being scheduled for a study screening visit. These questions are for preliminary screening only and are not used as study data. 
Questions include queries about health history/habits, age, sex, height, weight, tobacco III. Recruitment Process

conditions. The study design is described in general terms to subjects, with mention of factors most likely to impact subject interest in participating. If the subject is  considered 
to fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria, an appointment will be scheduled for a review of medical history and written consent.  
 
Screening and Consenting Visit  
For all subjects, informed written consent will be obtained using HIPAA Research Description and Consent Forms approved by [CONTACT_817418].  The study physician will be available to answer any potential questions.  During that process, the subject will be asked to describe, in their own words, what the study  procedures will be like. They will be 
provided with the study details. Review of the consent form will occur with study personnel in a quiet, unhurried setting. Comprehension will be assessed by [CONTACT_231867].  Participant s will have adequate opportunity to review 
the informed consent and to ask any questions they may have about the research protocol, compensation, risks, and benefits of taking part in the study.  This study visit will 
also include collection of medical history and payment information and Glycocheck instruction and practice with the participant.

Page [ADDRESS_1131870] a  25% effect of zanamivir on FMD.  Based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_116378], this represents approximately one- third of the distance in mean response between 
healthy and T2D subjects.  Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_817409]-subject 
variance, assuming a correlation of r=0.[ADDRESS_1131871] (Harris, Padilla et al ., 2006). Sample size was estimated using the software 
package PASS and confirmed using code from Jones & Kenward (2015).  A total size of 18 subjects will provide 80% power to detect a 25% difference when testing a two- sided 
alternative with alpha of 0.05.  The final sample size will be increased to 20 to 
accommodate as much as a 10% drop- out rate.  A p<0.[ADDRESS_1131872] all measurements repeated. Study procedures take 
approximately 3 hours to complete at each assessment.  
Special consideration in case of unforeseeable hardships such as public health 
emergencies or weather -related events  
If subjects are not able to complete study visits, the following remedial steps will be taken:  
1. Medication  may be mailed to the subject through the investigational pharmacy.  
2. In the case that subjects are unable to complete their follow up assessments at the originally scheduled dates, their medication course maybe delayed to better accommodate scheduling availability.  Treatment duration will remain the same.  
3. In the event of the Clinical Research Center (CRC) not being available or if it is considered by [CONTACT_817419], the following alternative sites  will be made available for screening, safety and study visits:  
a. MUPAW , Diabetes Center . 
These locations are not carpeted,  and we do not anticipate an increased risk for the 
subjects given that medical supervision and nursing staff assistance will be unchanged.  
 
Study procedures:  VI. Number of Subjects  
VII. Study Procedures/ Design/Treatment Plan  
Page 6 of 11  Brachial artery FMD:  Arterial measurements will be performed by [CONTACT_817420]- resolution duplex ultrasonography. Arterial vasodilatory 
responses to hyperemia ( i.e., FMD) will be examined by [CONTACT_57094] a forearm cuff up to 250 
mmHg for five  minutes.  Before, during and after rapid release of the cuff, brachial artery 
blood flow velocity and diameter will be continuously measured. In addition, during the 
FMD measurements, near -infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)  probes will be placed on the 
forearm; the probe will be secured via an elastic tensor bandage which will be loosely wrapped around the site. These probes will stay attached to the participant for the duration of testing.  The FMD procedure will be performed in duplicate.  
 Glycocheck:  The Glycocheck video microscope instrument will be placed under the 
subject’s tongue to measure capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], blood vessel density, red blood cell 
concentration, flow rate, and red blood cell penetration of the glycocalyx lining.  Glycocheck is an FDA Class 1 Medical Device.   This procedure takes approximately 1 
hour to complete.  
 
Study medications  
Zanamivir: Used as the study medication. Subjects will inhale 10mg of zanamivir twice 
daily for five  days.  
 
Sources of research material  
Sources will include the subject’s medical history, physical exam, blood tests, brachial artery FMD, and Glycocheck. Demographic data (plus other related data: emergency contact [CONTACT_9702], pregnancy status), blood pressure, and anthropometrics (height and weight)  will be measured.  Each subject will donate up to [ADDRESS_1131873] patients who are not on medications; however, it would neither be safe nor ethical to completely discontinue medications. Therefore, we will study patients on their existing drug therapy but will limit recruitment to patients on the fewest medications. Common medications in T2D ( e.g., insulin, metformin, 
gliptins, GLP -1 analogs, SGTL2i, antihypertensives, antidepressants, statins) will be 
considered during recruitment, analyses ( e.g., using covariate analysis) and 
interpretation.  
 
Subject safety  
Should subjects exhibit changes in their health status across any system related or unrelated to the study treatment, [CONTACT_817427], the safety officer, will be consulted for advice.  
    
The following are potential risks:  
 VIII. Potential Risks/Adverse Events  
Page 7 of 11  Venous blood draw : The potential risks of a venous blood draw include infection, 
swelling and discomfort at the puncture site. Some bleeding may occur as well after the  
needle is removed. There is also the possibility of fainting, dizziness, and possible pain 
and bruising as a result of the puncture. These risks will be greatly minimized by [CONTACT_817421] .  Risk 
of bleeding is reduced by [CONTACT_817422]. Bruising is treated with ice.  Fainting is prevented by [CONTACT_817423] -recumbent position.   
 Brachial artery FMD with NIRS: This is a measurement of endothelial function. There are no risks associated with this procedure. When assessing FMD, the blood pressure cuff will squeeze the arm tightly; however, any discomfort will be alleviated as soon as the pressure in the cuff is released.  
 Glycocheck: This procedure poses no risks.  
 Zanamivir : Potential  side effects are outlined in package insert. Medication should not 
be administered to individuals with COPD or asthma.  
 
Protection against risks  
Risks to loss of confidentiality are reduced by [CONTACT_231876] a data identifier code.  Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_231845] a locked office, and only the study personnel have access to the locked files. Individual names or initials are not used in any discussions or publications of the data. We have assembled a research team which includes scientists, physicians, and clinician- scientists with significant experience in human research and 
cardiometabolic diseases to help anticipate and reduce the risks to subjects.   
 
Plan for reporting study deviations  
Any minor problem/deviation will be summarized and reported to the IRB within five working days of awareness, including any event that does not: 1) increase the risk to the subject, 2) decrease the benefit to the subject, or 3) significantly affect integri ty of the 
research data. Any major problem/deviation will be summarized and reported to the IRB within five working days of awareness, including any event that: 1) increases the risk to the subject, or 2) significantly affects integrity of the research dat a.   
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_817410] a serious adverse event  occurs. If four or more subjects 
experience a serious adverse event requiring termination of the study, the study will be 
stopped and the events will be discussed with the IRB to determine whether it is appropriate to continue and/or determine appropriate modifications to the protocol to avoid further adverse events. All unanticipated serious adverse events will be submitted for review according to current protocols. The medication will be disconti nued at the discretion 
of the study safety officer.  
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
Page [ADDRESS_1131874] medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of 
the following criteria (a – f): 
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267373] a serious adverse event if  
at least one of the following exceptions is met:  
- The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] [ADDRESS_1131875].  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity  
Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s  
functions.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect  
f. Is another serious or important medical event as judged by [CONTACT_093].
 
Breach of confidentiality  
Subject confidentiality will be rigorously maintained. The data collected as part of this study will be for research only. It will be de- identified after collection. Confidentiality of data will 
be assured by [CONTACT_817424], including the use of secure files, locked in an office, and a unique subject coding system. The original study data will be kept in locked in an office (hard copy) or entered into a secure computer database password protected under a secure server space allocated for use by [CONTACT_231878] (electronic). Furthermore, data analysis will be appropriately blinded and any individual data presented in manuscripts will also be presented in an anonymous nature. No identifying information will be disclosed.  
Confirming with University of Missouri policy, all research records will be retained for a period of seven years following completion of the study.  
All protocols and techniques to be used will be approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) prior to initiation of any studies. Each subject will give written informed consent after all questions have been answered by a study team member. The consent form will also include a statement guaranteeing confidentiality.  Adverse event reports and annual 
Page [ADDRESS_1131876] completed multiple clinical studies involving human subjects with adherence rates of greater than 95% and subject retention rates of greater than 85%. We utilize a validated retention strategy published by [CONTACT_231880] (Am J Clin Nutr. 2003;78(4): 684-
689) that has been successful. With respect to subject honoraria, subjects will be paid $50 after completion of the screening visit, $250 after the baseline visit, and $300 after the final visit. Thus, a total compensation of $600 will be provided as s tudy events are 
completed.   
  
 
 
The subjects will not be charged for any procedures that are part of this research study.  
The costs of the study will be covered by a federal grant from the NIH.

Plan for adverse event reporting :  
Serious adverse events will be reported to the NIH.  Unanticipated events will be reported 
to the IRB, and both serious and non- serious adverse events will be reported to the MU 
School of Medicine DSMC. For reporting to the DSMC, adverse events will be categorized and classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Scale (CTCAE v3.0).  Safety reports will be sent to the safety officer.  The PIs will be responsible for assembling the data and producing these reports, as well as assuring that all parties obtain copi[INVESTIGATOR_96462].  
 
Qualifications and responsibilities of the safety officer:  
Guido Lastra, MD, Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, and board- certified endocrinologist will serve as the independent safety officer for this 
project.  [CONTACT_817429] is an experienced patient -oriented investigator, who is not part of the 
key personnel involved in this project but is familiar with all the proposed methodologies and their potential risks to human subjects. His expertise is in cardiovascular function and diabetes. As safety officer, [CONTACT_817429] will review eligibility criteria with the PIs and [CONTACT_231894]. He will review all reports sent by [CONTACT_817425], trigger of an ad hoc review, or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_817412].

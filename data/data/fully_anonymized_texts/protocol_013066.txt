OBJECTIVES : 
STU#: 00203896  
Version #:  1.0 Version Date:  11/11  /[ADDRESS_597023] of ethnicity, health 
literacy (as evaluated by [CONTACT_465607]), catastrophizing ( as 
evaluated by [CONTACT_208791]), and the relationship of the companion  to 
the parturient.  We hypothesize that there may be specific subgroups in which the 
parturients satisfaction is improved  by [CONTACT_46917] a companion  during labor 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_41835];  however , a significant improvement in maternal anxiety, 
when including all participants, will not be apprec iated.  
 
 
BACKGROUND : 
Currently at our institution, the support team for the parturient in labor is asked to exit 
the room during the placement of the labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_13864] .  However, there has been 
a recent movement in many institutions to allow  a companion  to be present during this 
perceived stressful procedure , as it  may improve maternal satisfaction  and anxiety , in a 
similar fashion as having a support person present during a cesarean delivery under 
neuraxial ane sthesia.  
 
There have only been two  randomized controlled trials published that have investigated 
the presence of a companion  during neuraxial procedures in a parturient.  The first was 
published by [CONTACT_465608] -Zinger et al. in Anesthesia and Analg esia (2012 ), investigating 84 
couples in Isreal, randomized between partner in (n=41) and partner out (n=42).  They 
investigated both partners’ anxiety utilizing the State Anxiety Inventory questionnaire 
before and after epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892], as well as aski ng the parturient to rate the pain 
associated with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892].  They found that there was actually an increase 
in anxiety when the partner was present in the room , and that the parturient perceived a 
more painful placement in this situation as well.  However, they did not evaluate 
whether the parturient wanted her partner present.  Additionally, this study did not focus 
on an American population, a population that has been described repeatedly to place 
high value on individual choice.  Iyengar and Lepper published a study in the Journal of 
Personality and Social Psychology (1999) describing the value that Americans place on 
individual choice, and showing that this v alue was present even in early childhood.  
Therefore, the results of a study in the [LOCATION_002] focusing on the choice of the 
parturient may very well yield different results than those found by [CONTACT_465608] -Zinger et al.   
 
The second study was published earl ier by [CONTACT_465609]. in the International Journal of 
Obstetric Anesthesia (2009) , and evaluated the anxiety of parturients both before and 
after the placement of neuraxial anesthesia prior to cesarean delivery .  They compared 
the anxiety level of the partu rient using a VAS, and found a small improvement in 
anxiety in those parturients whose partners were present during placement.  This study 
was conducted in Ann Arbor, MI, and investigated an American population, but did not 
specifically address the choice of the parturient.  Instead, as with the first study 
mentioned, the groups were randomized to partner in versus partner out, and never  
inqui red as to the preference of the parturient.  Additionally, the neuraxial procedure 
occurring in an  operating suite, as opposed to a labor and delivery suite, and the 
STU#: 00203896  
Version #:  1.0 Version Date:  11/11  /[ADDRESS_597024] at Prentice Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_465578] a companion  present during the placement of a labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_465579] .  Those that already had a  labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_465580] a companion  present during the placement, while those who 
did not yet have one placed were asked if they would choose to have someone present 
if they were given the choice.  An overwhelming number of parturients (29/34 ) stated 
that they would choose to have a companion  present for the procedure.  Additionally, of 
those who would not have chosen to have someone present (5/34), two stated that they 
still would have appreciated being given the choice.   Our study would add to the two 
prior studies by [CONTACT_465610] a companion  improves satisfaction, as well as anxiety , during the 
placement of a labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_465581] . 
 
 
INCLUSION AND EXCLUS ION CRITERIA : 
Parturients will be screened for eligibility on a basis of reason for admission to the labor 
and delivery ward.  Those that are being induced for labor or arrive in spontaneous 
labor will be considered.  T hose admitted for a planned procedure, other than labor, will 
not be eligible.  
Companions will be approached on the labor and delivery unit 8th and 9th floor Prentice 
Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_465582]. A verbal consent will be obtained.  
 
 
Physician Participants  
 
A) Attending Physicians will be approached on the labor and delivery unit on the 8th floor 
Prentice Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_465583] . Risks and benefits as well as responsibilities of completing the 
questionnaire will be discussed.   
 
B) Resident Physicians  and Anesthesiology Fellows  
The resident physician  or fello w will be approached on the labor and delivery unit on the 
8th floor Prentice Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_465584]. Risks and benefits as well a s responsibilities of completing 
the questionnaire will be discussed as well as the ability  for the resident to opt out of 
study participation.  
 
Inclusion:  
Parturients will be included if they are delivering the first child and are planning to labor 
with neuraxial analgesia .  Additionally, there will need to be sufficient time before 
delivery to allow the completion of the Pre procedure questionnaire, State -Trait Anxiety 
STU#: 00203896  
Version #:  1.0 Version Date:  11/11  /2016   Page 4 of 12 Inventory (STAI) questionnaire both before and after the procedure, as well as the 
Newest Vital Sign ques tionnaire and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale questionnaire 
before the procedure.   They will be included if they are ASA 2.   Furthermore, they be 
required to read and comprehend the English language, as the Newest Vital Sign 
questionnaire requires them to r ead and interpret a nutrition label.  
  
Physician Inclusion:  
Anesthesiology Attending , Fellow or Resident  Physicians  who participants in the 
placement of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_465585]:  
Primary companion identified by [CONTACT_465611] 18  
 
Exclusion:  Parturients will be excluded if they are receiving neuraxial anesthesia for a 
cesarean delivery , external cephalic version, or other non -labor procedure.  They will 
also be excluded if they begin to push for delivery before completion of the STAI 
questionnaire following labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_41835] .  They will be excluded if 
there is no support person present at t he time of the neuraxial procedure.  They will be 
excluded if they are ASA [ADDRESS_597025] a contraindication to receiving any 
of the medications routinely used in the placement of a labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_13864]  
(lidocaine, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], epi[INVESTIGATOR_22493] e, fentanyl).  Adults who are unable to consent  and 
minors will be excluded.

completion is late spring to early summer of 2017.  
 
 
STUDY ENDPOINTS : 
The primary endpoint  for the study is: 
- Does having a support person present when it is the desire of the parturient has 
a positive effect on maternal satisfaction  during the placement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_465587]?  
The secondary endpoints are:  
- Does having a support person present when it is the desire of the parturient has 
a positive effect on maternal anxiety  during the placement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_465588]?  
- Does having a support person present when it is the desire of the parturient ha ve 
a positive effect on maternal perception of pain during the placement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_465587]?  
- Does the presence of a support person affect the perceived difficulty of the 
procedure by [CONTACT_465614][INVESTIGATOR_13864] ? 
- Does the level of health literacy of a parturient affect her level of anxiety?  
- Does the degree of Pain Catastrophizing affect the parturients level of anxiety?  
- Does the relationship of the parturient to the support person have an effect on 
the level of anxiety of the parturient?  
- Does the ethnicity of the parturient have an effect on the level of anxiety?  
- Does induction of labor versus spontaneous labor have an ef fect on the level of 
anxiety of the parturient?  
 
PROCEDURES INVOLVED : 
Parturients who have been admitted to the Labor and Delivery ward at Prentice 
Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_465589] a member of the research  team prior to  the 
placement of a labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_13864] .  They will be asked if they are considering 
neuraxial  labor  analgesia , and if  they are they will be screened using the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria to determine study eligibility.  Once they have been evaluated and 
found to be appropriate for the study, they will be invited to participate.  
 
Participants will be asked to fill ou t the STAI questionnaire to assess the level of anxiety 
prior to placement of the labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_13864] , and before knowing their group 
assignment . They will then complete the pre procedure questionnaire. This 
questionnaire asks about expectations she ha s for the labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_13871] .  They 
will then be given the page of the Newest Vital Signs questionnaire with the Nutrition 
Facts, and be asked the [ADDRESS_597026]  
if he/she would prefer to be present for the procedure.   This form will be collected from 
the support person, and without the parturient aware of the support person’s response, 
she will be asked for her preference  with regard to the presence of a support person in 
STU#: 00203896  
Version #:  1.0 Version Date:  11/11  /[ADDRESS_597027] for placement, or provide the companion  a non -mobile chair 
to sit on in front of the partur ient for placement of the labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873].  The  companion  will 
be asked to remain in the chair.  He/she will be asked to focus on the parturient .  It will 
be emphasized that he/she must remain seated and will not be allowed to  observe the 
procedure being performed.  This is to prevent loss of consciousness in the companion , 
which has been documented in the literature (Devore and Asrani, 1978; Crosby [CONTACT_465615], 1989).  One violation wi ll result in a warning, and after a secon d the  
companion  will be escorted out of the room and the participant will be removed from the 
study.  
 
The provider will place the labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_465590], as is common 
practice at Prentice Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  After preparation and drapi[INVESTIGATOR_465591],  infiltration with Lidocaine 1%  will be conducted at L3 -L4 or L4 -L5. A  17g 
Tuohy needle will be advanced into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814], using a loss of resistance with 
either saline or air, depending on the  provider’s preference.  After the epi[INVESTIGATOR_465592], a 27g pencil -tip spi[INVESTIGATOR_465593], into 
the intrathecal space, and an intrathecal dose of medication will be administered.  The 
exact dose to be injected will  be left up to the discretion of the provider, who will 
determine the appropriate dose based on the patient’s situation at that time.  After the 
intrathecal dose is administered, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_465594] a 19g epi[INVESTIGATOR_465595].  It will be secured at 
the skin with a sterile dressing and tape, leaving 5cm of the catheter in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_341006].   The patient will then be placed in a lateral position.  
 
After the completion of the neuraxial p rocedure, the study participant will be asked to 
record her overall satisfaction with the procedure, as well as her perception of pain 
during the placement of the labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810], using two VAS from [ADDRESS_597028] pro cedural questionnaire.   At that point the 
parturient’s participation in the study will be complete.  
 
The provider or research team member will be asked to fill out the Participant’s 
Demographics Information form.  
 
The provider placing the labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_465596]/her  ability 
to palpate landmarks for placement, the positioning of the patient, and overall  perceived 
difficulty with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892], using a VAS from 0 -100mm  for each , which will be 
kept confidential.   Additionally, they will complete a short series of questions focusing on 
STU#: 00203896  
Version #:  1.0 Version Date:  11/11  /2016   Page 7 of 12 the presence  of a companion for the procedure.   No identifying information from the 
provider will be recorded on this form.  
 
DATA AND SPECIMEN BA NKING : 
N/A 
 
DATA AND SPECIMEN MANAGE MENT : 
Group sample sizes of 75 and 75 achieve 81% power to show a difference in means 
when there is a difference of 4.7 between the null hypothesis mean difference of 0.0 
and the actual mean difference of -4.7 at the 0.050 significance level (alpha) using a 
two-sided Mann -Whitney -Wilcoxon Test.  
 
The acquired data forms will be kept in folders with only the study ID number as an 
identifier.  These folders will be placed in a secure, locked cabinet in the Office of the 
Section of Obstetrical Anesthesiology.  Only those  researchers  directly analyzing these 
data will have access to the files .  Any electronic communication regarding the study will 
be conducted using the secure Northwestern email service.  Computerized data forms 
will be password protected.  Only the study ID number will be used to identify 
participants during data analysis.  The data will be stored until the completion of the 
study, including the final data analysis.  Members of the anesthesia team collecting 
these data will be educated on the pro cess prior to approaching prospective 
participants.  
 
These data collected from each participant will include:  
- STAI forms before and after epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892]  
- Pre and post procedure questionnaire  
- VAS scoring of satisfaction and pain perception following the procedure  
- Newest Vital Sign form completed before epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892]  
- Pain Catastrophizing Score form completed before epi[INVESTIGATOR_13892]  
- Relation of the support person to the parturient  
- Support person and parturients preference completed before epi[INVESTIGATOR_465597]  
- Post procedure questionnaire from the Resident/Fellow  Physician  
- Post procedure questionnaire from the Attending Physician  
 
PROVISIONS TO MONITO R THE DATA TO ENSURE  THE SAFETY OF 
PARTICIPANT S: 
N/A 
 
WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANT S: 
Participants will be withdrawn from the study if the companion  is required to leave due 
to violation of directions.  These include entering the room before the procedure is 
completed if he/she is in the partner out group, getting up from the chair or attempting to 
watch the procedure after a warning in the partner in  group.  When a participant 
withdraws, data collected up to that point will be retained and analyzed at the end of the 
study to determine if there is an identifying characteristic that predisposes to inability to 
follow instructions for safe participation with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13871].

RISKS TO PARTICIPANT S: 
Risks to the parturients participating in this study are the same risks as those electing to 
have neuraxial labor analgesia  not involved in the study.  The placement of a  labor 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_465598], which are communicated to the parturient 
before obtaining informed consent for the procedure.  These include bleeding, infection, 
nerve injury, post -dural puncture headache, hypotension, fetal bradycardia, nausea, 
vomiting, and very rarely  seizures and cardiac arrhythmias.   
 
There is the potential for feeling emotionally uncomfortable answering some of the 
questionnaires.  
 
There is the potential for loss of confidentiality even though there are strict measures in 
place to prevent occurrenc e. 
 
The risks to the companion  include a vasovagal response and loss of consciousness.  
To best prevent this risk he/she will be seated in front of the parturient, unable to directly 
witness the placement of the labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_13864] .  Additionally, he/she will be placed 
on a seat that does not have wheels and cannot move.  
 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS T O PARTICIPANT S: 
The potential benefit to the parturient is an improvement in both satisfaction and anxiety 
during the procedure, through the prese nce of a familiar companion . 
 
 
VULNERABLE POPULATIO NS: 
The study is designed to evaluate an intervention during labor and is therefore, by 
[CONTACT_108], involving pregnant women.  The study itself does not change whether 
neuraxial analgesia will be offered to an individual for labor pain.  The HRP -[ADDRESS_597029] has been reviewed and there are no conflicts noted.

RECRUITMENT METHODS : 
Participants will be recruited on the Labor and Delivery Ward  8th floor of Prentice 
Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  They will be approached regarding participation if they meet 
inclusion criteria during chart review or initial pre -anesthesia interview.  Both patients in 
spontaneous labor and those scheduled for induction of labor will be approached if they 
meet criteria.  The GE Centricity computerized board that lists all active laboring 
parturients is available in the anesthesia work room for review of the current Labor and 
Delivery census.  If the patient is nulliparous  she will be appr oached by a member of the

All parturients on the Labor and Delivery Ward at Prentice Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_465604], in anticipation of an unplanned sur gical emergency requiring intervention by 
[CONTACT_108424].  During the interview they are simply asked if they are planning to 
have neuraxial labor analgesia .  This does not affect the remainder of the interview, 
except to explain to the parturient the  steps involved in the placement of the labor 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13864] , as well as the risks and benefits.  During the study period, those 
parturients that fit the inclusion/exclusion restrictions will also be asked if they are 
interested in participating in a st udy that is “evaluating the impact of a companion ’s 
presence during the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13871] .”  Regardless of their response, if they are 
interested in receiving neuraxial  labor  analgesia and are an appropriate candidate for 
the procedure, they will receive a labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_13864] .  It is rare on the Labor and 
Delivery Ward to receive a specific request of a certain level provider to place the labor 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13864] , however it does happen.  As is the case currently, the best effort will 
be made to honor the request, however due to staffing and volume of patients, this is

as it relates to the patient’s current labor eve nt and to document a pre-anesthesia 
evaluation in the patient’s chart.  The patient’s EMR will not be used in any greater 
capacity than is required to care for the patient during her labor.  After the study data 
have been collected for each participant, it  will be placed in a locked file that will only be

in the study.  Prior to signing the study consent, they will be made aware of the 
questionnaires they will be asked to complete, as well as the randomization process 
that will be used to place them one of two groups.  The study itself inv olves no more 
than minimal risk to the parturient, as the procedure to be performed will be the same as 
the currently performed for neuraxial labor analgesia .  The only difference in the two 
procedures is the presence of a companion .  She  will still be asked to sign a consent  
form, however, that reiterates the study, and the grounds by [CONTACT_465620] n will 
be asked to leave during the procedure, if he/she is randomized to the “ companion  in” 
group.

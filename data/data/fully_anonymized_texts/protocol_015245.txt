Title of Study:  A Randomized, Multicenter, Double -Masked, Placebo -Controlled Study of the Safety 
and Efficacy of OmegaD Softgels in the Treatment of Dry Eye Disease  
Studied Period (Years):  
Estimated date first subject  enrolled: November  [ADDRESS_1183759] completed: July 2020 Phase of Development:  
3 
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  once daily dosing of  
OmegaD softgels  in the treatment of subjects with dry eye disease.  
Methodology:  
This will be a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, placebo -controlled study. Subjects will be 
randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms and treated for 84 days (12 weeks) as follows:  
• OmegaD softgels (N =150 subjects) : 4 softgels to be taken daily at bedtime. No other 
orally taken medications (including vitamins) should be taken within 2 hours of taking 
the study medication.  If necessary to minimize any digestive upset, subjects may take 2 
softgels twice daily ( BID), provid ed that dosing of study medication is not within [ADDRESS_1183760] dose should  be tak en between meals and the second dose 
should be taken at bedtime  
• Placebo softgels (N =150 subjects) : 4 softgels to be taken daily at bedtime. No other 
orally taken medications (including vitamins) should be taken within [ADDRESS_1183761] dose should  be taken between meals and the second dose should 
be taken at bedtime   
Comparisons of OmegaD softgels to placebo will be double -masked; OmegaD softgels and placebo 
will be id entically appearing softgels.  
At Screening (Day -7 to Day -1), sites will obtain signed informed consent, demographic information, 
medical/ocular and concomitant medication histories, perform a urine pregnancy test (women of 
childbearing potential only), c onduct screening examinations ( Ocular Surface Disease Index [OSDI] 
questionnaire [to be completed by [CONTACT_1766]], tear osmolarity testing, meibomian gland dysfunction 
grading, tear break -up time [TBUT ], Schirmer’s test  [anesthetized] ), and assess adverse eve nts (AEs). 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be reviewed.  
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Screening will return to the site at Baseline (Day 1) and the 
site will update concomitant medications , perform a urine pregnancy test (women of childb earing 
potential only),  and conduct baseline examinations . Continuing eligibility for enrollment will require  
a negative pregnancy test result (if performed),  tear osmolarity ≥  312 mOsm/L and meibomian gland 
dysfunction grade [ADDRESS_1183762] one eye  at both Screening

    and Baseline,  TBUT ≤  7 seconds in both eyes  at Screening , Schirmer’s test score (anesthetized) at 
Screening must be ≥  [ADDRESS_1183763] be ≥ [ADDRESS_1183764] be present in the same eye at both Screening 
and Baseline if only one eye qualifies. The study eye will be the worse eye at Baseline as defined by 
[CONTACT_851337]; if both eyes score equally on tear osmolarity , the eye with the lower 
TBUT  score will be chosen, and if still equal, the right eye will be the study eye. After 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are reviewed, the site will randomize eligible subjects.  The HS-Omega -[ADDRESS_1183765] ( IP) and a daily IP diary  and assess AEs.  
Subjects will take [ADDRESS_1183766] will return to the site at Day 42 (± 7 days) along with all unused IP and the IP diary . The 
subject will complete an OSDI questionnaire, and site personnel will update concomitant medications , 
conduct a slit  lamp examination, dispense new IP, assess AEs, and perform IP accountability and 
diary review.  
Subjects will return to the site at Day 84 (±  7 days), along with all unused IP and the IP diary, for 
final safety and efficacy evaluations. The subject will complete an OSDI questionnaire  and answer a 
question to establish their compliance with dosing of any vitamin s (to be taken more than 2 hours 
before or after study medication)  during the s tudy. Site personnel will update concomitant 
medications, perform a urine pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential only), conduct all 
specified ophthalmic assessments, assess the HS-Omega -[ADDRESS_1183767] already completed their Day 84 Final Study Visit at the time of this Protocol 
Amendment (V4.0) will be contact[CONTACT_851338] (to be taken more than 2 hours before or after s tudy medication) during the study.  
Number of Subjects (Planned):  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1183768] completed 
treatment, a review of treatment compliance will be conducted. Noncompliance will be defined as a 
total of 28 missed softgels in a 6 -week period. If more than 10% of subjects have protocol deviat ions 
for treatment compliance, the study will be resized to achieve a study population in which 90% are 
compliant.

    Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints:  
The primary efficacy endpoints comprise a set of hypotheses that will be tested in a hierarchical 
fashion.  
• Mean change from baseline in t ear osmolarity  in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84)  
• Mean change from Screening in OSDI score  at Visit 4 (Day 84)  
The differences between the 2 treatment groups will be tested with a significance level of 0.05. In  
order to control the Type I error rate these 2 endpoints will be tested sequentially in the order 
described above. If the null hypothesis for the tear osmolarity endpoint can be rejected at P ≤ 0.05, 
OSDI endpoint will be tested at  P ≤ 0.05.  
Secondary Eff icacy Endpoints:  
• Mean change from baseline in TBUT in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84)  
• Mean change from Screening in Schirmer’s test (anesthetized) score in the study eye at 
Visit 4 (Day 84)  
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint:  
• Proportion of subjects with meib omian gland dysfunction grade of 0 on both 
meibomian orifice size and telangiectasia scales in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84)  
Safety Endpoint:  
• Incidence of AEs  
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Populations:  
• Intent -to-treat (ITT): The ITT population will include all randomized subjects.  
• Per protocol (PP): The PP population will include all ITT subjects who remain in the 
study through Visit [ADDRESS_1183784] the primary outcome of the study.  
• Safety: The safety population will include all subjects who have received at least one 
dose of the IP.  
Efficacy analysis will be conducted on the ITT population and on the PP population. Safety analyses 
will be performed using the safety analysis population.  
Statistical Analyses:  
Analysis of TBUT, meibomian gland dysfunction, tear osmolarity, and Schirmer’s test scores  
(anesthetized)  will utilize the designated study eye (worse eye at Baseline as defined by [CONTACT_851341]; if both eyes score equally on tear osmolarity , the eye with the lower TBUT  score 
will be chosen, and if still equal , the right eye will be the study e ye) to assess the significance of the 
differences between OmegaD and placebo. The unit of analysis for OSDI symptoms will be the 
subject.  
Statistical significance for the comparison of means will utilize an analysis of covariance  using 
treatment, center, and baseline values as covariates . Statistical significance for binary data will be 
assessed by a chi -square, Fisher's exact, or Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous outcomes (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean, median, maximum, and minimum) and 
categorical variables (frequency and percentage) at each assessment time point. All summary tables 
will be supported with individual subject data listings.  
A comprehens ive Statistical Analysis Plan will be completed  prior to completion  of data collection .

    Sample Size:  
A total of 150 subjects per groups is planned. Power considerations for each endpoint a re described 
below.  
Tear osmolarity: In the initial placebo -controlled trial of OmegaD , the change from baseline in tear 
osmolarity  was -13 (SD= 22). Two natural history studies in dry eye suggest that changes in tear 
osmolarity  can become less or more severe. The former trial  reported  a mean decrease  of 6 mOsm/L , 
whereas the lat ter trial reported a mean increase of approximately 20 mOsm/L. A sample size of [ADDRESS_1183785] 95% power to detect a difference in changes in tear osmolarity means of 8 
mOsm/L ( -13 mOsm/L  for OmegaD and -5 mOsm/L for placebo ), assuming that the common SD of 
change is [ADDRESS_1183786] with a 0.05 two -sided significance level.  
OSDI: As OSDI is a subjective subject -reported outcome , some degree of improvement is expected 
from tri al participation. In the initial placebo -controlled trial of OmegaD , the change from baseline in 
OSDI was -13 points (SD= 20). In natural history studies , changes from baseline in OSDI were -7 
and -10 points (SD≈ 16). A sample size of [ADDRESS_1183787] approximately 95% power to 
detect a difference in change in mean OSDI scores of 7 points ( -13-point change for OmegaD and -6-
point change for placebo),  assuming that the common SD of change in OSDI is 17.0, us ing a two -
group t -test with a 0.05 two -sided significance level.  
TBUT: In the initial placebo -controlled trial of OmegaD , the change from baseline in TBUT was 1.4 
seconds with a SD  of 2.8. In natural history studies , changes from baseline in TBUT were 0.4  and 0 
seconds (SD≈ 1.9). A sample size of [ADDRESS_1183788] approximately 95% power to detect 
a difference in changes in mean TBUT of 1 second (1.4 -second change for OmegaD and 0.4 -second 
change for placebo), assuming that the common SD of change  in TBUT is 2.4, using a two -group 
t-test with a 0.05 two -sided significance level.

   4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Background  Information  
Dry eye disease is a common multifactorial ophthalmologic disorder of the tears and ocular 
surface. Dry eye affects approximately 4.9 million people  (3.2 million women and 1.7 million 
men) 50 years and older in the [LOCATION_002] (US ; Schaumberg et al, 2003 ; Schaumberg et al, 
2009 ). Inflammat ion is an integral component of this disease, as shown by [CONTACT_851342] , such as interleukin  1 (IL -1), tumor necrosis 
factor  alpha (TNF -α), and matrix metalloproteinase s 3 and 9 (MMP -3, MMP -9; Pflugfelder, 
2004 ). This is supported by [CONTACT_851343]® (cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion, 
0.05%), a drug that targets the immune system, is approved for the indication of increased tear 
production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular 
inflammation associated with keratoc onjunctivitis sicca  and effectively treats these symptoms  in 
some patients. The efficacy of Restasis is considered to be modest , and ocular burning after 
instillation, the most common adverse reaction, sometimes limits patient compliance and leads to 
disco ntinuation  of the drug . There is a clear medical need for more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
4.2. Rationale for the Development of OmegaD Softgels  for the 
Treatment of Dry Eye  
Among alternative drug treatments fo r dry eye, oral treatment with omega -3 fatty acid 
supplements, in particular the marine omega -3s eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) , appears to be promising. Essential fatty acids have been shown to 
diminish inflammatory responses i n many human inflammatory diseases.  
EPA and DHA compete for the same enzymes as the omega -6 fatty acid,  arachidonic acid (AA ). 
As omega -3 levels increase  relative to omega -6 levels , the competition for cyclooxygenase  and 
5-lipoxygenase suppresses AA synthesis of inflammatory mediators prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and 
leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) and increase s EPA and DHA synthesis of anti-inflammatory  
(prostaglandin E 1 [PGE 1]) and weakly inflammatory ( prostaglandin E 3 [PGE 3]) mediators. This 
shifts the balance to a less inflammatory mixture  of eicosanoids (James et al, 2000 ). EPA and 
DHA supplementation also decrease s monocyte synthesis of cytokines TNF -α and interleukin  1 
beta (IL-1β), with cytokine synthesis decreasing as cellular EPA concentrations increase 
(Caughey et al, 1996 ). More recently , EPA and DHA derivatives , resolvin s and protectins, have 
been shown  to act to initiate the resolution of inflammatio n by [CONTACT_851344] (Kohli and Levy, 2009 ).  
Because  inflammation is a key component of dry eye disease and increasing the systemic levels 
of omega -[ADDRESS_1183799] often 
increased tear break -up time ( TBUT ), with increased Schirmer’s test scores  (anesthetized)  and 
improved meibum characteristics reported by [CONTACT_223684] ( Bhargava et al, 2013 ; 
Kanga ri et al, 2013 ; Kawakita et al, 2013 ; Macsai, 2008 ; Oleñik et al, 2013 ; Wojtowicz et al, 
2011 ).

   On the basis of the clinical development conducted  by [CONTACT_277361] 
(PRN) with PRN Dry Eye Omega Benefits®, OmegaD  LLC  is now developi[INVESTIGATOR_277350]. 
A randomized, masked clinical trial was conducted with 105 subjects with dry eye who were 
randomized to 4 Dry Eye Omega Benefits softgels or placebo (safflower oil) softgels daily and 
treated for 3 months. Statistically significantly decreased tear osmolarity and dry eye Ocular 
Surface Disease Index (OSDI) symptom s and significantly increased TBUT were observed for 
subjects who received Dry Eye Omega Benefits versus placebo ( Donnenfeld et al, 2015 ). The 
safety profile appeared to be satisfactory , with  4 subjects in each treatment group  report ing 
adverse events ( AEs; Omega Benefits 7.5%, placebo 8.0%). All the AEs reported for the Omega 
Benefits group were mild  and included stomach upset (2 subjects), diarrhea, headache, upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], and flu. The stomach upset reported fo r one subject and the diarrhea 
reported for another were considered possibly related to study drug . OmegaD softgels is a  
formulation that is similar to Dry Eye Omega Benefits , having identical  amounts of EPA and 
DHA.  
Omega D LLC conducted a multicenter, placebo -controlled, double -masked, randomized clinical 
trial in subjects with dry eye disease.  One hundred and eighty (180) subjects were randomized 
(OmegaD, n=89; placebo, n=91), with 173 subjects completing the study (OmegaD, n=85; 
placebo, n=88).  After 84 days of treatment, the results of the study showed that although 
treatment with OmegaD softgels achieved an approximate 30% change from baseline in both 
TBUT and OSDI, there was no significant difference between OmegaD and placebo for eithe r of 
these parameters [TBUT ( P = 0.54), OSDI ( P = 0.52)]. The lack of significant difference was 
considered primarily due to the unexpectedly high placebo response rates. The Omega -3 Index 
score was significantly increased in the OmegaD group compared with  placebo ( P < 0.0001), 
showing that omega -3 fatty acids in the RBC membranes had increased over the duration of the 
study in those subjects receiving OmegaD softgels. The safety profile of OmegaD softgels in this 
study was similar to the previous PRN study . There were no serious adverse events ( SAEs ) in 
either group and a total of 56 AEs were reported in 39 subjects (OmegaD, 31 AEs in 23 subjects 
[25.8%]; placebo, 25 AEs in 16 subjects [17.6%]). Of these, only diarrhea (n=4 subjects), 
abdominal discomfort ( n=2), abdominal pain (n=2), and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (n=4) 
were reported in more than one subject in either group (>  2%). All AEs were either mild or 
moderate in intensity. Four subjects in the OmegaD group and [ADDRESS_1183800] to Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) regulation  as food 
supplements, the clinical data to support activity in dry eye disease  may not have been reviewed 
by [CONTACT_1622] . OmegaD LLC plans to conduct a clinical program to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of a controlled, pharmaceutical -grade omega -3 oral supp lement for dry eye disease.  
4.3. Justification for Dose, Regimen, and Treatment Period  
The omega -3 daily dose to be utilized in OmegaD -2019-002, 1680 mg of EPA and 560 mg of 
DHA,  is the same dose utilized  in the PRN study , in which significant separation was observed 
between OmegaD and placebo in OSDI symptoms, TBUT, and tear osmolarity  (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_815396], 
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol  Omega D -2019 -002  IND 130264  
 
20 
   2016 ). This dose also  appeared to be well tolerated based on the low numbe r of AEs reported  
(unpublished data) . The daily amount of omega -3 in OmegaD is less than that present in Lovaza® 
capsules (1860 mg of EPA and 1500 mg of DHA), the FDA -approved EPA/DHA product  
indicated for the reduction of triglyceride levels in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia, the 
safety of which was established in the clinical trials conducted in support of approval. The 
treatment period of [ADDRESS_1183801] study duration in trials of dry eye disease.  
4.4. Good Clinical Practice Statement  
This study  will be conducted according to all stipulations of the protocol, including all 
statements regarding confidentiality, and in compliance with International Council for  
Harmonis ation  (ICH) guidelines,  and all appl icable US  federal regulations and local legal  and 
regulatory requirements.  
4.5. Population to Be Studied  
Study subjects will be ≥ 18 years and ≤ 90 years  of age, with an OSDI score ≥ [ADDRESS_1183802]  one eye, tear osmolarity of ≥ 312 mOsm/L and meibomian gland dysfunction  as defined 
by a grade  of [ADDRESS_1183803] be ≤ 7 seconds in both eyes at Screening , and Schirmer’s test 
score  (anesthetized)  in both eyes must be ≥  [ADDRESS_1183804] be present in the same eye at both Screening and Baseline 
if only one eye qualifies.  See Section 7 for inclusion and exclusion criteria.

6.1. Overall Study Design  
This will be a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, placebo -controlled study. Subjects will 
be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms and treated for 84 days  (12 weeks ) as follows:  
• OmegaD softgels (N =150 subjects) : 4 softgels to be taken daily at bedtime.  No other 
orally taken medications (including vitamins) should be taken within 2 hours of 
taking the study medication.  If necessary to minimize any digestive upset, subjects 
may take 2 softgels twice daily ( BID), provided that dosing of study medication is  not 
within [ADDRESS_1183805] dose should be taken between 
meals and the second dose should be taken at bedtime . 
• Placebo softgels (N = 150 subjects ): 4 softgels to be taken daily at bedtime. No other 
orally taken medications (including vitamins) should be taken within [ADDRESS_1183806] dose should be taken between meals 
and the second dose should be taken at bedtime . 
Comparisons of OmegaD softgels to placebo will be double -masked; OmegaD softgels and 
placebo will be identical ly appearing softgels . 
At Screening (Day -7 to Day -1), sites will obtain signed informed consent, demographic 
information, medical/ocular and con comitant medication histories, perform a urine pregnancy 
test (women of childbearing potential only) , conduct screening examinations (tear osmolarity 
testing, meibomian gland dysfunction grading, TBUT, Schirmer’s test  [anesthetized ], and 
OSDI ), and  assess AEs.  Inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be reviewed.  
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Screening will return to the site at Baseline (Day 1) and 
the site will update concomitant medications , perform a urine pregnancy test (women of 
childbearing  potential only),  and conduct baseline  examinations. Continuing eligibility for 
enrollment will require  a negative pregnancy test  result (if performed) , tear osmolarity 
≥ 312 mOsm/L and meibomian gland dysfunction grade [ADDRESS_1183807] one eye  at both Screening and Baseline , TBUT ≤ 7 seconds in both eyes  at 
Screening , Schirmer’s test score  (anesthetized)  must be  ≥ [ADDRESS_1183808] be ≥ [ADDRESS_1183809] be present in the same eye  at both Screening and Baseline  if only one eye 
qualifies . The study eye will be the worse eye at Baseline as defined by [CONTACT_851345]; if both eyes score equally on tear osmolarity , the eye with the lower TBUT  score will be 
chosen, and if still equal, the right eye will be the study eye.  After inclusion/exclusion criteria are 
reviewed, the site will randomize eligible subjects.  The HS-Omega -[ADDRESS_1183810] 
(IP) and a daily IP diary  and assess AEs.  
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol  Omega D -[ADDRESS_1183811] will return to the site at Day 42 (± 7 days) along with all unused IP and the IP diary . 
The subject will comp lete an OSDI questionnaire, and site personnel will update concomitant 
medications, conduct a slit  lamp examination, dispense IP, assess AEs, and perform IP 
accountability  and diary review .  
Subjects will re turn to the site at Day 84 (±  7 days) , along with all unused IP and the IP diary , for 
final safety and efficacy evaluations . The subject will complete an OSDI questionnaire and 
answer a question to establish their compliance with dosing of any vitamin s (to be taken more 
than 2 hours before or a fter study medication) during the study . Site personnel will update 
concomitant medications, perform a urine pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential 
only), conduct all specified ophthalmic assessments, assess the HS-Omega -[ADDRESS_1183812] ick blood sample, assess AEs, and perform IP accountability  and diary review .  
Both eyes will be assessed at each visit. A Es and concomitant medications will be documented 
from signing of informed consent at Screening to Day 84 . 
Note: For those subjects un able or unwilling to attend a scheduled study visit in -person during 
the COVID -19 pandemic, a “phone visit” will be conducted to allow collection of as many data 
points as possible, including changes to concomitant medication, AE inquiries, OSDI 
questionna ire responses, and response to the vitamin dosing compliance question. Subjects  who 
are willing and able will be asked  to come into the office for the F inal Study Visit, during which 
all scheduled assessments will be conducted . Additional subject enrol lment will occur to 
compensate for those subjects unable or unwilling to attend their Final Study Visit , to ensure a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_1183813] completed 
treatment , a review of treatment compliance will be conducted.  Noncompliance will be defined 
as a total of 28 missed softgels in a 6 -week period.  If more than 10% of subjects have protocol 
deviations for treatment compliance, the study will be resized to achieve a study population in 
which 90% are compliant.  
Note: Due to the COVID -19 pandemic , some subjects may be unable or unwilling to attend their 
Final Study Visit  (see Section 6.1). Additional subject enrol lment will occur to compensate for 
these subjects , to ensure a minimum of [ADDRESS_1183814] ( IRB), sites/investigators, and subjects .

OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol  Omega D -[ADDRESS_1183824]   
The daily dose of OmegaD softgels, 4 softgels, contains 168 0 mg of EPA and 560 mg of DHA , 
with other naturally occurring omega -3 fatty acids, an antioxidant (alpha tocopherol), and a 
flavoring agent in a softgel shell composed of gelatin, glycerin, and colorant . The softgel is 
formulated with the omega -3 fatty aci ds in the triglyceride form . 
8.1.2.  Reference Therapy  
The placebo softgels contain  mineral oil in a softgel shell composed of gelatin, glycerin, and 
colorant .  
8.2. Randomization and Masking  
An Interactive Web Response System  (IWRS) /Interactive Voice  Response System  (IVRS)  will 
assign a kit number to subjects who qualify for randomization. IP will be randomized in a 1:1 
ratio (O megaD to placebo ). A randomized block design will be used, and the randomization will 
be created by [CONTACT_46134].  
If subjects meet eligibility criteria at Screening and at Baseline (see Section 7 for eligibility 
criteria), they will be randomly assigned to IP at the Baseline Visit. Clinical  sites will utilize the 
IWRS to assign kit s to subjects . The IP kit randomization number will be recorded in the 
subject’s eCRF. 
A supply of randomized IP from the assigned kit sufficient to last until  Day [ADDRESS_1183825] at the Baseline Visit; and at the Day [ADDRESS_1183826] ’s treatment assignment in case of emergency, the 
Investigator may obtain the treatment code for a given randomized subject  from the [ADDRESS_1183827]’s IP kit. The randomization code is to be obtained only if a 
medical emergency exist s and knowledge of the medication being taken will influence the 
medical management of the subject. In the event of emergency or life -threatening condition, the 
Investigator may need to unmask the subject.  The following procedure should be followed:  
1. The In vestigator should contact [CONTACT_387753] a subject, unless it is not possible to do so without risk to the subject.  
2. The Investigator should document the SAE and justification for unmasking in the Study 
Summary an d Comments pages of the eCRF.  
3. The subject may continue to participate in the study at the Investigator’s discretion. If the 
subject is to be discontinued from study participation, then ALL procedures described in 
the Early Discontinuation Visit ( Section 10.4) should be completed.

    Prohibited ophthalmic medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_6523] 21 days prior to Screening and 
throughout the study period include the use of any topi[INVESTIGATOR_277353]:  
• Cyclosporine (ie, Restasis  and Cequa ) 
• Lifitegrast (Xiidra)  
• Steroids  
• NSAIDs  
• Antiglaucoma medications  
• Anti-microbials  
• Macrolides  
Additionally, oral nutraceuticals (fish, flax, black currant seed oils, etc. ), oral tetracyclines, and 
oral macrolides  are prohibited within 21  days prior to Screening and throughout the study period.  
Isotretinoin (Accutane®) is also prohibited within [ADDRESS_1183832] lens and ophthalmic drop  use (eg, artificial tears) , while permitted during the study 
period, are prohibited within designated time periods prior to any study visit. Contact [CONTACT_851346] 12 hours prior to any study visit  (subjects determined to have worn contact 
[CONTACT_72061] [ADDRESS_1183833]  be rescheduled) , and ophthalmic drop use is prohibited within 
2 hours prior to any study visit.  
The following procedures are prohibited as specified:  
• LASIK or PRK performed within one year prior to Screening and throughout the 
study period  
• History of cauterization of the punctum  or existing silicone punctal plug(s) ; history of 
silicone plug removal or collagen plug insertion or removal within 12 months prior to 
Screening and throughout the study period .  
8.4. Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be monitored by [CONTACT_851347]’ daily IP diaries . The 
amount of unused softgels returned at the Day 42 and Day 84 Visits (IP accountability) and the  
information provided in the IP diaries by [CONTACT_851348] (eDC) system.  
8.5. Discontinuation of Investigational Product  
Subjects may be discontinued from IP for either of the following reasons:  
• The subject has a clinically significant or serious AE that would not be consistent 
with continuation in the study, as  determined by [CONTACT_851349] D -2019 -002  IND 130264  
 
 30  
    − It is possible for subjects to experience a skin rash or other allergic reaction 
related to the components of the softgels; if this occurs, the subject should 
discontinue the medication  
• Pregnancy  
If a subj ect is discontinued from IP or is generally non compliant with the protocol , every effort 
should be made to encourage the subject to continue to attend study visits to be followed for 
safety, rather than withdrawing the subject from the study. Reasons for c onsidering subject 
withdrawal from the study are discussed in Section  7.3. 
8.6. Investigational Product  Materials and Management  
8.6.1.  Packaging and Labeling  
IP will be packaged and labeled at a central packaging facility. Each subject kit will consist of a 
single box with [ADDRESS_1183834] will receive 2  bottles 
of IP. The study site will retain 3 bottles, 2  of which will  be dispensed at the Day 42 Visit, and 1 
extra bottle  will be maintained at the site  in case of loss or damage .  
8.6.2.  Storage  
Store at 15° to 25°C (59° to 77°F). Do not freeze. Keep out of reach of children.  
8.6.3.  Administration  
Following randomization, site personnel will dispense IP and instruct the subject on 
administration procedures. The daily dose is 4 softgels to be taken at bedtime. No other orally 
taken  medications (including vitamins) should be taken within [ADDRESS_1183835] 
dose should be taken between meals and the second dose should be taken at bedtime . 
8.6.4.  Dispensing  
At randomization, a  kit with 2 bottles of IP (sufficient IP to last until the Day 42 Visit with a 
little overage) and a IP diary  will be dispensed to the subject with instructions to return the kit 
along with all unused IP and the completed study diary  at the Day 42 Visit. At the Day 42 Visit, 
the unused IP will be counted, and the site will dispense 2 bottles of IP (sufficient IP to last until 
the Day 84 Visit with a little overage)  and the IP diary with instructions to return the kit along 
with all unused IP and the completed study diary  at the Day 84 Visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Interim COVID -19 Pandemic Dispensing  Procedures  
During the COVID -19 pandemic, sites may dispense  to subjects as much  IP as necessary  
(including the fifth/reserve bottle) to allow the subjects to continue to take their study medication 
until they are able to return for a final visit . In addition, subjects will be  dispensed an extra diary 
with blank study dosing days to be completed if they  take IP for more days than originally 
intended in order to allow continue d dosing through to the Final Study Visit. 
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol  Omega D -[ADDRESS_1183836] not received the  remainder 
of the IP, they can receive the IP  and an extra diary with blank study dosing days  in any of the 
following ways:  
• In-person during an already scheduled study visit  
• In-person pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up by [CONTACT_19578], or designee, if the subject is unwilling or unable to keep 
a previously scheduled study visit  
• IP and extra diary delivered to the subject by [CONTACT_464]  
• IP and extra diary shipped overnight to the subject by [CONTACT_851350], study drug accountability records will be maintained, and 
delivery methods will be documented by [CONTACT_779].  
8.6.5.  Investigational Product  Accountability  
The Investigator or designee (eg, study coordinator or pharmacist) will maintain a full 
accou ntability record for the IP and will be responsible for recording the receipt, dispensing, and 
return ing all supplies of the IP using the inventories supplied by [CONTACT_31474] . Clinical site personnel 
will document all dispensed  and returned IPs at Baseline (Day 1), Day [ADDRESS_1183837] read, 
sign, and date the current IRB -approved version of the informed consent form  (ICF) . A full 
discussion of informed consent is presented in Section  13.3. 
9.1. Demographic and Background Characteristics  
9.1.1.  Demographic Information  
Demographic information , including date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, and date of informed 
consent , will be recorded.  
9.1.2.  Medical/Ocular History  
Clinically significant medical and ophthalmic history will be documented and will include any 
previously diagnosed ophthalmic abnormal ities and ocular surgeries, including laser and 
non-laser procedures.  
9.1.3.  Concomitant Medications History  
All concomitant medications (prescription and OTC) taken at Screening  and for [ADDRESS_1183838] dose, site of 
dosing (eg, right eye, left eye, both eyes, systemic), and the reason the concomitant medication is 
being taken must be recorded in the  eCRF . When a concomitant medication has been taken at a 
stable dose for longer than [ADDRESS_1183839] will be performed at Screening , at Baseline,  and at the Final  Study  Visit 
(Day  84) or the Early Discontinuation Visit for women of childbearing p otential only.  
9.2. Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.1.  Signs  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tear Osmolarity  
Tear osmolarity will be tested via the Tear Lab Osmolarity Test.  The osmolarity testing must 
precede  all other diagnostic examinations  (except the OSDI at Visit 4) , and the subject must 
refrain from administ ering any tear supplements within [ADDRESS_1183840] follow the protocol specified  in the Study  Procedures  Manual.  If an invalid 
reading is obtained ( < 275 or > 400 mOsm/L ), the investigator sho uld wait at least [ADDRESS_1183841] tear osmolarity . No other diagnostic examinations  can be administered until a valid tear 
osmolarity reading is obtained . Investigators can use up to 3 attempts to obtain a valid reading 
(with a 10 -minute waiting perio d between attempts).

A. Meibomian Orifice Size Scale  
GRADE  EYELID MARGIN MEIBOMIAN ORIFICE SIZE FINDINGS  
[ADDRESS_1183842] be present in the same eye  at 
both Screening and Baseline  if only one eye qualifies . 
B. Telangiectasia Scale  
GRADE  EYELID MARGIN TELANGIECTASIA FINDINGS  
0 No blood vessels present between meibomian glands  
1 One (1) blood vessel present between 4 pairs of glands/orifices  
2 More than 1 vessel between 4 pairs of glands/orifices  
3 More than 1 vessel with vasodilation between 4 pairs of glands/orifices  
4 More than 1 vessel with vasodilation between 4 pairs of gland s/orifices with erythema of 
the tissue  
A certain score on the telangiectasia scale is not required for study entry, nor is it an exclusion 
criterion . The telangiectasia and meibomian orifice size  scales will provide additional detailed 
information with which to track the progress/resolution of meibomian gland disease.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tear Break -Up Time  
A drop of Altafluor is added to the eye  and the subject may blink  for [ADDRESS_1183843] avoids blinking , the tear film is observed under t he slit  lamp through a 
cobalt blue filter  and timed until tiny dry spots develop. If there is break -up in the tear film 
immediately after the blink , this shall be registered as 0 . The procedure is conducted 3 times for 
each eye and the TBUT  for each is  measured in seconds and recorded in the eCRF.  The average 
for each eye will be calculated by [CONTACT_243840]  (see Study Procedures  Manual) .

    [IP_ADDRESS].  Schirmer’s Test (Anesthetized)  
An anesthetized Schirmer’s test will be performed to ensure that  only basal tear secretion is 
being measured  and to prevent tearing due to the irritation from the filter paper  (the eye s will 
already have been anesthetized  for the TBUT procedure). Schirmer  strips will be placed in both 
eyes on the lower eyelid margins  at the same time. The eyes are closed for 5 minutes. The strips 
are then removed and the amount of moisture on each strip in millimeters (mm) is measured and 
recorded in the eCRF  (see Study Proced ures Manual) . 
9.2.2.  Symptoms  
A laminated copy of t he OSDI questionnaire (Appendix A ) will be provided to the subject, who 
will be asked to point to the number that corresponds with the frequency of  dry eye symptoms 
experienced over the past week. Site personnel will enter the scores in the eCRF. The eDC 
system will automatically calcula te the final score.  
9.3. Safety Assessments  
9.3.1.  Slit Lamp Examination  
A routine slit  lamp examination will be performed to evaluate the anterior segment of the eye, 
including lids, cornea, conjunctiva, anterior chamber, iris, and lens. Abnormalities will be 
documented.  
9.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
9.4.1.  HS-Omega -[ADDRESS_1183844] is 
identified and packaged to be submitted to OmegaQuant (Sioux Falls, SD) for analysis.  
9.5. Other Assessment  
9.5.1.  Vitamin Dosing Compliance Question  
At the Final Study Visit, subjects will be asked  the yes/no question , “During the study, di d you 
regularly take any vitamins within 2 hours of taking your study medication?”  Subjects  who have 
already completed their Day 84 Final Study Visit at the time of  this Protocol Amendment (V 4.0) 
will be co ntacted by [CONTACT_851351] (to be 
taken more than 2 hours be fore or after study medication) during the study .

    9.6. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
9.6.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered an IP  
(pharmaceutical/biological product) that does not necessarily h ave a causal relationship to this 
medication. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal 
laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the IP, whether 
or not related to the IP. IP includ es the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator 
product or vehicle placebo that is given during any phase of the study.  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investigational treatment are only 
considered AEs if they worsen  after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test results 
constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically 
significant, or require therapy.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_31463] -ended questioning of the subject at each visit 
during the study. At each clinic visit, study personnel should ask the following question: "Have 
you had any problems since your last visit?” AEs also may be detected when they are 
volunteered by [CONTACT_851352] v isits or through study assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  or sight -threatening  
Note: The term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (excluding 
progression/outcome of the disea se under study)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or  
• Is medically significant  (ie, defined as an event that jeopardizes the health of the 
subject or may require medical or s urgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above ) 
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31437] a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is  
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of the study, is not 
considered an SAE.  
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol  Omega D -2019 -002  IND 130264  
 
 36  
    All SAEs that are ongoing at the time of completion or discontinuation from the study will be 
followed until stabilization (ie, no other c hange in the condition is expected ) or resolution of the 
event.  
9.7. Relationship to Investigational Product  
The relationship of AEs to the IP should be assessed by [CONTACT_851353].  
Not suspected : The temporal relationship of the event to the IP makes a causal relationship 
unlikely, or, other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a suffici ent 
explanation for the observed event.  
Suspected : The temporal relationship of the event to the IP makes a causal relationship possible 
or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient 
explanation for the obse rved event.  
If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the IP and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered 
“suspected.”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and th e IP is determined by [CONTACT_851354] “suspected ,” the event will be considered to be related to the IP for the purposes of expedited 
regulatory reporting  (see Section  9.9). 
9.8. Recording Adverse Events  
AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from the study 
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], regardless of severity or potential association with the IP 
or study procedures, will be recorded in the eCRF . Clinically si gnificant changes in blood 
pressure and heart rate should be reported as AEs ; however , omega -[ADDRESS_1183845] beneficial effects on blood pressure and heart rate. Only clinically 
significant changes (increase or decrease)  in heart rate should be reported as AEs . All AEs that 
occur after a subject has signed the ICF until the Final Study Visit (Visit 4/Day 84), should be 
collected and recorded on the AE eCRF  page. AEs that occur after informed consent is provided 
but before the first  dose of IP will be summarized  separately from AEs that occur from the first 
dose of double -masked treatment on Day 1 to the Day 84 Visit. Following Visit 4 (Day 84), all 
AEs “suspected” to be related to the IP should be followed until resolution . 
Medical conditions/diseases occurring before the first dose of IP during Visit 2 (Day  1) should 
be collected on the medical/ocular history pages of the eCRF . 
The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, 
the Investigator will evaluate and report the following:  
• Onset date  
• Resolution date  
• Severity grade (mild, moderate, severe)  
• Relationship to IP (not suspected, suspected)  
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol  Omega D -2019 -002  IND 130264  
 
 37  
    • Action taken (none, IP temporarily interrupted, IP permanently discontinued; 
concomitant m edication taken; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; other)  
• Serious outcome (yes/no)  
The severity grade should be determined by [CONTACT_31467] : 
• Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  
• Modera te: Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal daily activity  
• Severe: Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
(as defined di rectly above) whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
An AE of severe intensity may not be considered serious.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form. Pregnancy in 
itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_851334] a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all preg nancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study.  
9.9. Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs ( suspected and not suspected ) will be recorded from signing of informed consent  until 
the Final Study Visit (Visit 4/Day 84), following the end of treatment exposure. Any SAEs 
“suspected” to be related to the IP and discovered by [CONTACT_851355] .  
Any SAE that occurs must be reported to Oculos  within [ADDRESS_1183846] should be maintained at the site with a copy emailed to 
OmegaD -safety @oculoscr .com . The Investigator mu st assess the SAE relationship and complete 
the SAE form. Oculos  may request additional information. Follow -up information (eg, discharge 
summary) will be retained in the subject’s chart and a copy will be em ailed to OmegaD -safety @ 
oculoscr .com . 
In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the A E eCRF  page with the serious question marked 
“Yes”.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the approving IRB of any SAEs on a timely basis 
as instructed by [CONTACT_3433] e Sponsor  or designee  following the Sponsor’s determination of causality.  
All subjects who experience an SAE should be followed clinically and undergo the appropriate 
diagnostic evaluations until stabilization or resolution of the event.  
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol  Omega D -2019 -002  IND 130264  
 
 38  
    Oculos will report all SAEs to the US FDA  on the appropriate schedule depending if the event is 
drug related or not drug related, expected  or unexpected (based on the available information in 
the Investigator’s Brochure ). 
Any death occurring  during the study or follow -up period should be reported as an SAE. For any 
death occurring through the end of the study, regardless of the degree of relationship to IP, the 
SAE resulting in the death must be reported to Oculos . A death  occurring after completion of the 
study  at Visit 4 (Day 84) does not require completion of the SAE form.

    11. STATISTICS  
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan will be completed prior to completion of data 
collection.  
11.1. General Considerations  
This is a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of once daily dosing of OmegaD softgels  for 84 days  (12 weeks ) in the 
treatment of subjects with dry eye disease.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio as follows:  
• OmegaD softgels  (N =150 subjects); 4 softgels at bedtime  
• Placebo softgels (N = 150 subjects); 4 softgels at bedtime  
A biostatistician will perform statistical analyses as agreed with the Sponsor according to the 
Statistical Analysis Plan. Any additional or supplemental data analysis performed independently 
by [CONTACT_277374].  
Efficacy analysis will be conducted on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population and on the per 
protocol (PP) population. Safety analyses will be performed using the safety analysis population. 
Definitions for all of the analysis populations can be found in Sect ion 11. 4. 
The study eye will be the worse of qualifying eyes at Baseline as defined b y the higher tear 
osmolarity ; if both eyes score equal ly on tear osmolarity , the eye with the  lower TBUT  score  will 
be chosen, and if still equal , the right eye will be the study eye. 
11.2. Handling of Missing Data  
The planned statistical methods use all available data. To account for the presence of missing 
data, multiple imputation may be used for ITT analyses on the primary endpoints. Multiple 
imputatio n will be carried out using the SAS procedures.  
11.3. Determination of Sample Size  
A total of 150 subjects per group is planned. Power considerations for each endpoint a re 
described below.  
Tear osmolarity: In the initial placebo -controlled trial of OmegaD , the change from baseline in 
tear osmolarity was -13 (standard deviation [ SD]=22). Two dry eye natural history studies 
(Smith , data on file  and Sullivan , 2012 ) suggest that changes in tear osmolarity  can become less 
or more severe. The former trial  reported  a mean decrease  of 6 mOsm/L , whereas  the lat ter 
reported a mean increase of approximately 20 mOsm/L. A sample size of [ADDRESS_1183855] 95% power to detect a difference in change in tear osmolarity means of 8 mOsm/L ( -13 
mOsm/L for OmegaD and -5 mOsm/L for placebo ), assuming that the common SD of change is 
19, using a two -group t -test with a 0.05 two -sided significance level.  
OSDI: As OSDI is a sub jective subject -reported outcome , some degree of improvement is 
expected from trial participation. In the initial placebo -controlled trial of OmegaD , the change 
from baseline in OSDI was -13 points  (SD= 20). In the natural history studies  described above,  
changes from baseline in OSDI were -7 and -10 points  (SD≈ 16). A sample size of [ADDRESS_1183856] approximately 95% power to detect a difference in change in mean OSDI scores 
of 7 points ( -13-point change for OmegaD and -6-point change for placebo) , assuming that the 
common SD of change in OSDI is 17.0, using a two -group t -test with a 0.05 two -sided 
significance level.  
TBUT: In the initial placebo -controlled trial of OmegaD , the change from baseline in TBUT was 
1.4 seconds (SD= 2.8). In the natural history studies described above, changes from baseline in 
TBUT were 0.4 and 0 seconds (SD≈ 1.9). A sample size of [ADDRESS_1183857] 
approximately 95% power to detect a difference in change in mean TBUT of 1 second (1.4 -
second change for OmegaD and  0.4-second change for placebo), assuming that the common SD 
of change in TBUT is 2.4, using a two -group t -test with a 0.05 two -sided significance level.  
11.4. Analysis Populations  
11.4.1.  Populations for Efficacy Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Intent -to-Treat Population  
The ITT population is defined as  all randomized subjects. The primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed on the  ITT population . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Per Protocol Population  
The PP population will include all ITT subjects who remain in the study through Visit 4 
(Day  84) and who did n ot deviate from the protocol in any way likely to seriously affect the 
primary outcome of the study. Secondary efficacy analyses will be performed on the PP 
population.  
11.4.2.  Safety Analysis Population  
The safety population will include all subjects who have received at least one dose of the IP. All 
safety analyses will utilize the safety population.  
11.5. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the ITT analy sis 
population; however, should there be a reasonable difference in the size of the ITT and safety 
analysis populations, demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for both. The 
comparability of groups used in comparison analyses will be c haracterized in tables of 
demographic data. Summary tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.  
11.6. Efficacy Analysis  
Primary efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population . Analysis of TBUT , 
meibomian gland dysfunction, tear osm olarity, and Schirmer’s test scores  (anesthetized)  will 
utilize the designated study eye (worse eye at Baseline as defined by [CONTACT_277375] ; if both eyes 
score equally  on TBUT the eye with the higher tear osmolarity  score  will be chosen , and if still 
equal the right eye  will be the study eye ) to assess the significance of the differences between 
OmegaD and placebo. The unit of analysis for OSDI symptoms will be the subject.  
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol  Omega D -2019 -002  IND 130264  
 
 44  
    Statistical significance for the comparison of means will utilize an analysis of covariance  using 
treatment, center, and baseline values as covariates . Statistical significance for binary data will 
be assessed by a chi -square, Fisher's exact, or Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuou s outcomes (number of subjects, mean, 
SD or standard error of the mean, median, maximum, and minimum) and categorical variables 
(frequency and percentage) at each assessment time point. All summary tables will be supported 
with individual subject data list ings.  
11.6.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint s 
The primary efficacy endpoints comprise a set of hypotheses that will be tested in a hierarchical 
fashion.  
• Mean change from baseline in t ear osmolarity  in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84)  
• Mean change from Screening  in OSDI  score  at Visit 4 (Day 84)  
The differences between the 2 treatment groups will be tested with a significance level of 0.05. 
In order to control the Type I error rate these 2 endpoints will be tested sequentially in the order 
described above. If the null hypothesis for the tear osmolarity endpoint can be rejected at 
P ≤ 0.05, OSDI endpoint will be tested at  P ≤ 0.05.  
11.6.2.  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
• Mean change from baseline in TBUT in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84)  
• Mean change from Screening in Schirmer’s test (anesthetized) score in the study eye 
at Visit 4 (Day 84)  
11.6.3.  Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint  
• Proportion of subjects with meibomian gland dysfunction grade of 0 on both 
meibomi an orifice  size and telangiectasia scales in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84)  
11.7. Safety Analyses  
Safety data will be presented in tables of descriptive statistics and frequency distribution. All 
summary tables will be supported with individual subject data l istings.

and

for
 
undertaking

Including
 
summary
 
of

(published
 
and

examining
 
benefits
 
and
 
harms
 
for
 
each
 
intervention
 
Sexual
 
assault
 
is
 
a
 
common
 
form
 
of
 
trauma:
 
approximately
 
36%
 
of
 
women,
 
17%
 
of
 
men,
 
and
 
34–47%
 
of
 
transgender
 
and
 
gender
 
diverse
 
individuals
 
are
 
sexually
 
assaulted
 
in
 
their
 
lifetime.
 
Three
 
quarters
 
of
 
survivors
 
have
 
elevated
 
symptoms
 
of
 
posttraumatic
 
stress
 
disorder
 
(PTSD)
 
one
 
month
 
after
 
sexual
 
assault.
 
Natural
 
recovery
 
of
 
PTSD
 
symptoms
 
is
 
common,
 
but
 
41%
 
of
 
survivors
 
still
 
have
 
PTSD
 
12
 
months
 
later.
 
There
 
is
 
evidence
 
that
 
early
 
interventions—
 
those
 
delivered
 
within
 
3
 
months
 
of
 
trauma—are
 
effective.
 
Early
 
interventions
 
have
 
reduced
 
PTSD
 
severity
 
among
 
sexual
 
assault
 
survivors.
 
Existing
 
early
 
interventions
 
focus
 
only
 
on
 
sexual
 
assault
 
survivors
 
and
 
do
 
not
 
target
 
the
 
social
 
contexts
 
in
 
which
 
survivors’
 
recovery
 
occurs.
 
However ,
 
these
 
social
 
contexts
 
are
 
important
 
to
 
recovery .
 
Nearly
 
all
 
survivors
 
seek
 
help
 
from
 
supporters
 
(e.g.,
 
friends,
 
family ,
 
romantic
 
partners),
 
often
 
soon
 
after
 
assault.
 
Unfortunately ,
 
most
 
survivors
 
receive
 
negative
 
reactions
 
when
 
they
 
seek
 
help,
 
and
 
these
 
reactions
 
increase
 
risk
 
for
 
psychopathology .
 
Importantly ,
 
supporters
 
do
 
not
 
necessarily
 
respond
 
in
 
negative
 
ways
 
with
 
malicious
 
intent,
 
but
 
instead
 
due
 
to
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
knowledge
 
about
 
effective
 
responses,
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
knowledge
 
about
 
survivors’
 
preferences,
 
or
 
difficulty
 
managing
 
their
 
emotional
 
reactions.
 
To
 
our
 
knowledge,
 
one
 
prior
 
preventative
 
intervention
 
has
 
aimed
 
to
 
improve
 
responses
 
to
 
disclosures.
 
Supporting
 
Survivors
 
and
 
Selves
 
trained
 
groups
 
of
 
under graduate
 
students
 
in
 
support
 
skills
 
in
 
anticipation
 
of
 
receiving
 
a
 
future
 
disclosure
 
of
 
interpersonal
 
violence.
 
In
 
a
 
randomized
 
clinical
 
trial,
 
this
 
intervention
 
led
 
to
 
improvements
 
in
 
intended
 
responses
 
but
 
did
 
not
 
change
 
actual
 
responses
 
among
 
those
 
who
 
prospectively
 
received
 
a
 
disclosure.
 
There
 
is
 
currently
 
no
 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-supported
 
intervention
 
to
 
improve
 
supporters’
 
ability
 
to
 
respond
 
effectively
 
to
 
survivors
 
in
 
the
 
immediate
 
aftermath
 
of
 
sexual
 
assault
 
and
 
thereby
 
[CONTACT_798862]’
 
downstream
 
outcomes.
 
We
 
created
 
CARE
 
(Communication
 
and
 
Recovery
 
Enhancement)
 
to
 
address
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
early
 
interventions
 
to
 
improve
 
supporters’
 
responses.
 
CARE
 
is
 
intended
 
for
 
survivors
 
of
 
past-10-week
 
sexual
 
assault
 
and
 
a
 
support
 
person
 
of
 
their
 
choice.
 
It
 
involves
 
two
 
telehealth
 
sessions
 
with
 
a
 
clinician
 
and
 
a
 
supporter ,
 
with
 
the
 
survivor
 
present
 
(dyadic
 
version)
 
or
 
without
 
the
 
survivor
 
present
 
(supporter -only

The
 
goal
 
of

is
 
to
 
describe
 
our
 
methods
 
for
 
a
 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_798846] -only

Our
 
goals
 
are
 
to
 
understand
 
feasibility ,
 
acceptability ,
 
and
 
preliminarily
 
characterize
 
efficacy .
 
We
 
hypothesize:
 
 
H1:
 
Dyadic

will
 
be
 
rated
 
as
 
acceptable
 
by

1-month
 
follow-up.
 
H2:
 
Dyadic
 
and

CARE
 
will
 
lead
 
to
 
increases
 
in
 
survivor
 
and
 
supporter
 
knowledge
 
from
 
baseline
 
to
 
1-month
 
follow-up.
 
H3:
 
Dyadic
 
and
 
supporter -only
 
CARE
 
will
 
improve
 
disclosure
 
experiences
 
(i.e.,
 
increasing
 
survivor
 
disclosure
 
frequency ,
 
reducing
 
supporter
 
negative
 
reactions,
 
increasing
 
supporter
 
responsiveness)
 
at
 
1-
 
month
 
follow-up
 
compared
 
to
 
waitlist.
 
H4:
 
Dyadic
 
CARE
 
and
 
supporter -only
 
CARE
 
will
 
improve
 
functional
 
outcomes
 
among
 
survivors
 
(i.e.,
 
PTSD,
 
stress,
 
relationship
 
quality)
 
and

We
 
do
 
not
 
expect
 
there
 
to
 
be
 
overwhelming
 
evidence
 
of
 
the
 
harm
 
of
 
the

but
 
we
 
will

this
 
and
 
stop
 
the

if

Survivor Consent Form 
[ADDRESS_1101867] a chance to discuss this form with a study staff member and then sign it during your appointment. You don’t need to sign it in advance.   UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON Survivor Consent Form (Stage 2) KEY STUDY INFORMATION We are asking whether you want to consent to participate in a research study. The research study aims to understand whether a program is helpful to survivors and their supporters.  Participation involves:   1. Two ~90 minute telehealth CARE program appointments that focus on how you and your supporter can communicate in ways that may help you recover. You will be randomly selected to get the program in one of three ways: a. Option 1: You and your supporter attend the program appointments together starting today. The first 90-minute appointment would start after your finish your questionnaires, so your entire appointment time today would be ~2.5 hours. You will both get a workbook to work on together after your appointment. b. Option 2: Your supporter attends the program appointments alone starting today and will be asked to meet with you to teach you about what they learned using a workbook that we will give both of you.  c. Option 3: You choose which version of the program you want, and you get it in 3 months.  2. Five online questionnaires: We will invite both you and your supporter to fill out online questionnaires today and every month for the next 3 months.  You will each earn $110 total if you complete all of these questionnaires. You will be paid: a. $10 for a 20-minute questionnaire at the beginning of the appointment today b. $10 for a 5-minute questionnaire at the end of the appointment today c. $20 for a 20-minute questionnaire in 1 month d. $30 for a 20-minute questionnaire in 2 months e. $[ADDRESS_1101868] information. We will not share your responses with your supporter, and we will not share your supporter’s responses with you. Only the research team will have access to this information. There is an important exception: if you tell us about a serious threat to your safety or someone else’s safety, we will need to tell someone else. Participation is completely voluntary (meaning it’s up to you). This study is not a part of any other clinical services you may be receiving and will not affect any other services you get. You can choose not to participate or end your participation at any time without any consequences. If you don’t want to participate but still want support, we will help connect you with services.

DETAILED STUDY INFORMATION Researchers:  [CONTACT_798913], Principal Investigator [CONTACT_318681]. of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington [PHONE_16680], [EMAIL_15204] [CONTACT_798914]-Gilligan, Co-Investigator Dept. of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington [PHONE_16681], [EMAIL_15205] Researchers’ Statement We are asking you to be in a research study that is funded by [CONTACT_402335]’s Office on Violence Against Women. The purpose of this statement is to give you the information you will need to help you decide whether to be in the study or not. Please read the form carefully. You may ask questions about the purpose of the research, what we would ask you to do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a volunteer, and anything else about the research or this form that is not clear. When we have answered all your questions, you can decide if you want to be in the study or not. This process is called “informed consent.”   You may choose to review this form and make a decision about participating separately from your supporter, or together. You may also talk privately about your decision to participate with your supporter, without the researcher present, should you wish to do so. However, to participate, both you and the person you came to this appointment with must agree to participate.   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY We are doing a study of a program that aims to help survivors and their supporters communicate in ways that may help survivors recover after an unwanted sexual experience. The study’s goal is to understand whether this program is helpful. We aim to enroll a total of 60-72 survivors and 60-72 of their supporters in this study.  STUDY PROCEDURES Participation in this voluntary study takes 3 months and involves two parts:  (1)  Filling out 5 questionnaires How the questionnaires work: We will ask you and your supporter to both fill out a 20-minute questionnaire at the beginning of the appointment today, then fill out the same questionnaire again in 1, 2, and 3 months. We will ask you to fill out a 5-minute questionnaire at the end of the appointment today. If your appointment today is interrupted, you will be sent this survey when you complete your appointment (which must occur within the next 14 days). We will send you a link for each questionnaire. You will have 14 days to complete each questionnaire.  Payment for questionnaires: You will each earn $110 total if you complete all of these questionnaires. You will be paid: a. $10 for the 20-minute questionnaire at the beginning of the appointment today b. $10 for the 5-minute questionnaire at the end of the appointment today c. $[ADDRESS_1101870] a chance to discuss this form with a study staff member and then sign it during your appointment. You don’t need to sign it in advance.  d. $30 for the 20-minute questionnaire in 2 months e. $[ADDRESS_1101871] from a variety of retailers (including Amazon, CVS, Target, and Safeway), or get a pre-loaded Visa cash card (which you may pi[INVESTIGATOR_798854]).  The kinds of questions you will be asked:  The questionnaires will ask sensitive questions about your feelings and mood, your opi[INVESTIGATOR_798855], your ability to function in your life, and characteristics of the unwanted sexual experience.  We will also ask you questions about your relationship with the person who came to this appointment with you today. Their surveys will include questions about you. To help make sure both of you know who we mean when we ask you questions about each other, we will mention their first name [CONTACT_798905], and your first name [CONTACT_798906].  You do not have to answer any questions you do not wish to answer. You can stop filling out questionnaires at any time. You can choose to not fill out a questionnaire at all. Here are some examples of the most sensitive questions: In the past month, how much have you been bothered by: ● Avoiding memories, thoughts, or feelings related to the unwanted sexual experience? ● Having strong negative feelings such as fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame? Have any of the following unwanted sexual experiences happened?  ● Someone had oral sex with me or made me have oral sex with them without my consent by [CONTACT_798886], for example holding me down with their body weight, pi[INVESTIGATOR_798856], or having a weapon. ● A man put his penis into my vagina, or someone inserted fingers or objects without my consent by [CONTACT_798887] I was too drunk or out of it to stop what was happening. If you had to decide today whether or not you want to participate in the legal process for the unwanted sexual experience, what would you choose? Getting your contact [CONTACT_3031]:  We will ask you to give us your preferred contact [CONTACT_3031] (your phone number, email, or social media information) so that we can contact [CONTACT_798888]-up questionnaires. Your name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_798889]. The information that you share is up to you, but we cannot send you questionnaires if we do not have contact [CONTACT_3031].  (2)  Getting the CARE program What the program involves: This program is not therapy. There are different options for getting the program, but all of them involve getting information about how to communicate with each other in ways that support your healing. The option that you get is decided randomly (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin).  
Survivor Consent Form 
[ADDRESS_1101872] a chance to discuss this form with a study staff member and then sign it during your appointment. You don’t need to sign it in advance.  ● Option 1: You and your supporter attend a ~[ADDRESS_1101873] 90-minute appointment would start after your finish your questionnaires, so your entire appointment time today would be ~2.[ADDRESS_1101874] be completed within 30 days. ● Option 2: Your supporter attends a ~[ADDRESS_1101875] as well without the survivor there.  ● Option 3: You choose which version of the program you want (with your supporter or your supporter alone), and you get that version in 3 months.  We are unable to make changes to your version of the program after it is assigned. If you get the program where you attend sessions together, both you and your supporter will need to be present for sessions to receive the program. If you get the version of the program where your supporter attends sessions alone, you will only be able to receive the program if they attend the sessions.  Audiorecording the program appointments: We will audiorecord the appointments so that we can make sure that the clinician is covering all the topi[INVESTIGATOR_798857]. If you give us any feedback about the program during the appointments, we will use the recordings to type out and save the feedback without your name [INVESTIGATOR_223477]. We will not use this recording for any other purpose and will destroy it as soon as we have checked it. Payment for the program appointment: Neither you nor your supporter will be paid for participating in the program: you will only be paid for questionnaires. You can still get paid for filling out the questionnaires even if you do not participate in the program.  Participation in this research is voluntary. That means it’s your decision. ● To enroll in the study, both you and your supporter must both consent to participate. However, you should each make your own decision about whether you want to participate. You may also tell us that you no longer want both you and your supporter to participate, in which case we will withdraw both of you from the study. However, you cannot replace your supporter with a different person. 
Survivor Consent Form 
[ADDRESS_1101876] a chance to discuss this form with a study staff member and then sign it during your appointment. You don’t need to sign it in advance.  ● It’s up to you whether you complete the questionnaires. You may skip over any questions you do not want to answer or decide to stop participating at any time. You can still receive the program even if you don’t fill out the questionnaires. If one person drops out after enrolling, the other person can still fill out questionnaires. ● It’s up to you whether you complete the program appointments. You can end your participation in the program at any time- even during an appointment. Even if you or your supporter choose to opt out of program appointments, you can still do questionnaires and be paid.  ● This study and the program we are studying are not part of your clinical services. Deciding not to participate will not affect any services you get at any other site serving survivors of unwanted sexual experiences (e.g., Harborview). Your decision to participate, and everything you tell us today, will not be recorded anywhere in your clinical files.    RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT There might be risks associated with being in this study.  ● The main risk of this study is that we will be asking you sensitive and private questions. These questions may make you feel uncomfortable or may feel intrusive.  ● You might feel uncomfortable about your supporter being asked questions about their relationship with you and their experiences supporting you. ● If your supporter does not attend program sessions, you will not be able to continue with the program alone or replace them with another supporter.  ● It is possible that participating in this program could call attention to problems you are having in your relationship. ● It is possible that you might not get your preferred version of the program, which could be disappointing or distressing.  ● It is possible that you might be chosen to get the program in [ADDRESS_1101877] whether this program is right for you; if this happens, we might need to refer you to other services instead of continuing with the program.  ● Although this program is based on research about what is helpful, some people may not find it helpful.  ● You might feel distressed if you want to participate and/or use the CARE skills and your supporter does not, or if your supporter wants to participate and/or use the CARE skills and you do not. ● It is possible that participating in this program could call attention to problems in your relationship. It is possible that this could be distressing or affect your relationship.  ● If someone else has access to the account or device where you receive links to surveys for this study, and unintentionally or intentionally accesses that account or device while you are actively taking a survey (before you finish the last question and submit your responses), they could see your survey responses. To prevent this, it is important that you

You don’t need to sign it in advance.  receive links at a private account, complete all surveys on a private device with security features enabled, and submit your survey as soon as possible.  If you feel upset, or if you have any questions or need assistance, you can tell the clinician, or you can contact [CONTACT_798890].    ALTERNATIVES TO TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY If you choose not to participate in this study but still want resources to help you cope, we can provide you with a list of information and referrals located within the community, and help connect you with services if you wish. BENEFITS OF THE STUDY You might not experience any direct benefits from participating in this study. Here are some possible benefits: ● You might learn more about yourself, your experience with unwanted sexual contact, and your relationships as you fill out the questionnaire, which could be helpful.  ● Your supporter might learn new ways to support you by [CONTACT_7466] a part of this program, and you and your supporter might learn more helpful ways to communicate with each other and work together to support your recovery.  ● Participating in this study could help people who have been sexually assaulted. To learn how to help survivors of unwanted sexual experiences, we need to do studies to see what’s helpful. This is one of those studies. If we learn that this program is helpful, we will be able to make it available to other people who have been sexually assaulted.  ● Participating in this study is a way to support research on the topic of sexual assault. CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH INFORMATION Any identifiable information collected about you will be used only for research and statistical purposes. We will use the information gathered in this study in two main ways: ● We will create research reports and presentations about this study that summarize its findings without singling out any one participant. Your name [CONTACT_798907]. ● A file containing answers to questionnaires from everyone who participates will be given to the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data so it can be shared with other researchers doing similar work at other locations. Everyone’s answers will be labeled with an ID number. The file will be checked to make sure that there is nothing in it that could tell anyone who you are. There will be no names, contact [CONTACT_3031], or any other personally-identifying information in the file.  Everything you tell us will be confidential. We will not share your responses with your supporter, and we will not share your supporter’s responses with you. We have taken steps to protect your confidentiality.   ● The questionnaires will be completed using a secure server, which provides the highest available level of protection for your confidentiality.  ● All of your questionnaire responses will be labeled with an ID number, rather than your name, the name [CONTACT_798908], or any other

That way, no one will be able to figure out your identity or the identity of the person participating in this study with you, even if they looked at the answers to your questionnaires.  ● We will put your ID number, name, and contact [CONTACT_69981] a special secured computer file. This file will be separate from all other information you give us as part of the study. The research team are the only ones who will have access to this file, and we will not share it with others. We will only use this file to contact [CONTACT_798891], pay you for your participation, and find your ID number. We will retain your name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_798892]/or federal law.  ● We have obtained a Privacy Certificate from the National Institute of Justice. This helps us protect your privacy. The Certificate means that we do not have to give out identifying information about you even if we are asked to by a court of law. We will use the Certificate to resist any demands for identifying information.  We can’t use the Certificate to withhold your research information if you give your written consent to give it to an insurer, employer, or other person. Also, you can share information about yourself or your part in this research if you wish. The Certificate expi[INVESTIGATOR_798858].  Currently this is 10/31/24.

We also ask you to take some steps to protect your own and each others’ confidentiality. • To make sure that no one can see your survey responses while you are in the middle of taking a survey, we ask you to make sure that no one else has access to the phone, laptop, or email accounts where you receive your survey links. You can do this by [CONTACT_798893], and that you submit your surveys as soon as possible.    • It is important to remember that the first name [CONTACT_798909], and your first name [CONTACT_798910]. Because of this, we ask you to help protect each others’ confidentiality by [CONTACT_798894], and filling out the questionnaire on a private, secure device. ● We encourage you to ensure that you are attending this session from a private location, and make sure that others cannot hear or see what’s happening.  ● We encourage you to check in with each other if there is anything that you would prefer the other person not share in this appointment. If you would like to do this, we will put you into a Zoom breakout room before we begin.  However, there are some important exceptions to confidentiality: ● The confidentiality of the data cannot be guaranteed if you report future criminal intent.  ● If we learn that you intend to harm yourself or others, or that anyone is at imminent risk of harm, we must report that to the authorities.  ● If you tell us about child/elder abuse, we are not allowed to report that unless you give us permission. We will give you the option of giving us permission but it will be up to you.

You don’t need to sign it in advance.  ● Government or university staff sometimes review studies such as this one to make sure they are being done safely and legally. If a review of this study takes place, your records may be examined. The reviewers will protect your privacy. The study records will not be used to put you at legal risk of harm. INFORMATION FOR ADOLESCENTS You do not need permission from a parent or guardian to be in this study. This is because, in Washington State, teens age 13-[ADDRESS_1101881] abuse, we will not tell anyone without your permission. Instead, we will give you the option of talking with us about the pros and cons of contact[CONTACT_798895], and different options for doing so. We will only tell the authorities if you fill out a form saying it’s okay. FUTURE USE OF DATA Data identified only by [CONTACT_798896] (not your name, contact [CONTACT_3031], or any other information that may identify you) may be shared with other researchers doing similar work on other campuses, be combined with data from other campuses in some research reports, and/or may be used to develop procedures used in future studies. These data will be retained indefinitely, identified only by [CONTACT_79164].  OTHER INFORMATION You may refuse to participate or withdraw from this study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. If at any point we determine that you are not eligible for this study, if your condition deteriorates, or if it becomes known that you require a higher level or different type of care, we will withdraw you from the study and not invite you to complete any remaining surveys or sessions. We will provide you referrals for services if this happens. You should not incur any expenses from your participation in this research. You are free to participate in other programs such as support groups, treatment, therapy, etc. while involved in the study.

We will also ask you questions about your relationship with the survivor. Their surveys will include questions about you. To help make sure both of you know who we mean when we ask you questions about each other, we will mention their first name [CONTACT_798905], and your first name [CONTACT_798906].  You do not have to answer any questions you do not wish to answer. You can stop filling out questionnaires at any time. You can choose to not fill out a questionnaire at all. Here are some examples of the most sensitive questions: Indicate how much you agree or disagree with the following statements about what it’s been like to try and help the survivor. ● I feel preoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_798860]. ● I feel disturbed dealing with his/her assault. How often did you respond in each of the following ways? ● Told them that they were irresponsible or not cautious enough. ● Got so upset that you needed reassurance from them.

Payment for the program appointment: Neither you nor the survivor will be paid for participating in the program: you will only be paid for questionnaires. You can still get paid for filling out the questionnaires even if you do not participate in the program.  Participation in this research is voluntary. That means it’s your decision. ● To enroll in the study, both you and the survivor must both consent to participate. However, you should each make your own decision about whether you want to participate.  The survivor also has the right to tell us that they no longer want both themselves and you to participate, in which case we will withdraw both of you from the study. However, the survivor cannot replace you with a different supporter. ● It’s up to you whether you complete the questionnaires. You may skip over any questions you do not want to answer or decide to stop participating at any time. You can still receive the program even if you don’t fill out the questionnaires. If one person drops out after enrolling, the other person can still fill out questionnaires.  ● It’s up to you whether you complete the program appointments. You can end your participation in the program at any time- even during an appointment. Even if you or the survivor choose to opt out of program appointments, you can still do questionnaires and be paid.  ● This study and the program we are studying are not part of your clinical services. Deciding not to participate will not affect any services you get at any other site serving survivors of unwanted sexual experiences (e.g., Harborview). Your decision to participate, and everything you tell us today, will not be recorded anywhere in any clinical files.    RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT There might be risks associated with being in this study.  ● The main risk of this study is that we will be asking you sensitive and private questions. These questions may make you feel uncomfortable or may feel intrusive.  ● You might feel uncomfortable about the survivor being asked questions about their relationship with you and their experiences being supported by [CONTACT_10825]. ● If you do not attend program sessions, the survivor will not be able to continue with the program alone or replace you with another supporter.

Page iii SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
The main purpose for this amendment is to add an additional study part (Part 3) to evaluate the 
relative bioavailability of two strengths of TBAJ -876 tablets. The formulation of the two 
strengths of tablets is identical and dose proportional.  
Part 3: TBAJ -876 Tablets 
Part 3 is a single dose, open- label, parallel design study to investigate the  safety , tolerability , and 
relative bi oavailability of two strengths of TBAJ -876 tablets: 25 mg and 100 mg. Three groups 
of ten subjects per group are planned. • Group 1: Single dose 100 mg TBAJ-876 as 1 x 100 mg Tablet fasting • Group 2: Single dose 100 mg TBAJ-876 as 1 x 100 mg Tablet fed • Group 3 Single dose 100 mg TBAJ-876 as 4 x 25 mg Tablets fasting  
Subjects will check -in on Day -1 following a 21-day screening period, remain in the clinic for 7 
days and be discharged on Day 8. They will then return to the clinic for a follow-up visit on Day 
10 and Day 14 for PK and safety. A follow-up phone call will occur on Day 21 to check for AEs. 
The amendment also includes the updates from two previous protocol clarification letters : 
• The first dated 02 Sep 2021 for the multiple ascending dose (MAD) (Part 2) of the study 
which added  an additional electrocardiogram ( ECG ) extraction on Day 1 and Day 14 at 
the 16 hour time point for Cohort 2 and 3, and updated the number of subjects from a total of 36 subjects to 39.  
• The second letter dated [ADDRESS_833919] 2021 added  an additional cohort (Cohort 7) to the single 
ascending dose (SAD) (Part 1) of the study and  clarif ied the ECGs timings and 
procedures for Cohort 3 in Part 2 of the study.  
In addition, based on the review of the Cohort 1 (MAD) PK and safety, the dose for Cohort 2 (MAD) was changed (as allowed by [CONTACT_760]) to 75 mg versus the original planned dose of 
50 mg.

“possibly related”. One subject in Cohort 6 had a mildly elevated 
troponin I on Day 21, with a value of 0.038 ng/mL, confirmed at 0.034 ng/mL (ULN 0.028 ng/mL). The subject was completely

examination and vital signs were normal. No QT prolongation was 
observed on the Holter or in subsequent ECGs. This event was 
reported as “possibly related”. Another  subject in Cohort 6 had a 
mildly elevated troponin I on Day 21, with a value of 0.038 ng/mL, 
confirmed at 0.034 ng/mL (ULN 0.028 ng/mL). The subject was 
completely asymptomatic, and her physical examination, vital 
signs, and ECG were normal. On the same day of the troponin I 
elevation, her CPK and CPK- Mb were also normal. The subject 
returned to the clinic on Study Day 23, and her troponin I levels were within the normal range. The finding of elevated troponin I on 
Study Day 21 was deemed  by [CONTACT_625958] 
“spuri ous”.  
1.7 Rationale for Dose 
selection (MAD)  Delete the last sentence from the paragraph:  
The choice of the doses for subsequent cohorts will be reconsidered 
after observing the exposures and safety in the first cohort.  
Add the following paragraph to end of section: 
Upon review of the MAD Cohort 1 (25 mg) PK and safety, the 
50 mg dose planned for Cohort 2 was changed to 75 mg. This decision was made based on the safety of the 25 mg dose which 
was shown to be safe and well tolerated without evidence of 
cardiac, muscle skeletal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, or 
hematological toxicity, and because the total exposure of TBAJ -876 plus M3 at the dose of 75 mg was predicted to still 
remain below thresholds determined by [CONTACT_625959] -month toxicity study in dogs.

Six dose levels are planned. Based on interim PK  data obtained during the dose escalation, a dose 
level  will be selected  at which to study the effect on PK of a high- calorie, high- fat meal.   
The first cohort will be separated into 2 groups. A sentinel group of 3 subjects (2 active and 1 
placebo) will be dosed at least 24 hours before the remaining 5 subjects (4 active and 1 placebo). The 
remaining cohorts will  not be so separated.  
Food- effect: B ased on exposure levels from the first [ADDRESS_833949] cohort will receive active drug  of TBAJ -
876, 100 mg .  
Additional cohorts may be enrolled if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_625966] a dose level or to 
study another dose level or increase cohort size (subject numbers). 
Additional cohort, Cohort 7 : Eight (8) subjects will be enrolled, 6 to receive active drug and 2 to 
receive placebo. Subjects will receive a single dose under fasted conditions.  
Dose = 800 mg TBAJ-876 or matching dose of placebo for TBAJ-876 Oral Suspension 
Subjects will fol low the procedures in Table 1 5, Schedule of Assessments and Procedures, Part 1 
SAD with the following clarifications:  
Subjects will check -in to the clinic on Day -[ADDRESS_833950] triplicate ECGs at 16 hours postdose. 
Dose escalation to the next cohort (i.e., dose level) or any changes of PK sampling and safety assessment timepoints will not take place until the Sponsor, in conjunction with the Principal  
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_625928], has determined that adequate safety, tolerability and PK 
from the previous cohort have  been demonstrated to permit proceeding to the next cohort. 
The decision for the study to progress to the planned MAD cohorts (Part 2) will not take place until 
the Sponsor, in conjunction with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_625929], has determined that adequate safety, tolerability, and PK s from the previous cohorts (Part 1) have been 
demonstrated to permit proceeding.
 
Part 2:  
Three cohorts are planned. Cohort 1 with 12 subjects per cohort (9 to receive active drug and 3 to 
receive placebo), Cohort 2 with 13 subjects per cohort (9 to receive active drug and 4 to receive 
placebo), and Cohort 3 with 14 subjects per cohort (9 to receive active drug and 5 to receive placebo) to receive TBAJ -876 or matching placebo for 14 days , all under fed conditions.  
For Cohorts 2 and 3, an additional ECG extraction will occur at 16 hours postdose on Day 1 and Day 
14. For Cohort 3, a ll ECGs p erformed will be triplicate ECGs at each time point listed in the Schedule 
of Assessments.  
Additional cohorts may be enrolled if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_625966] a dose level or to 
study another dose level.

proportionality will be assessed using the power model approach. 
For Part 3 , the following PK parameters will be calculate d for Group 1 (1 x 100 mg tablet, fasted), 
Group 2 (1 x 100 mg tablet, fed), and Group 3 (4 x 25 mg tablets, fasted): 
Cmax, Tmax, AUC last, AUC inf, AUC Extrap, Clast, Tlast, λz, t1/2, CL/F, and Vz/F. 
PK parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_227257]. Food effect (Group 2, fed, 1 
x 100 mg tablet vs. Group 1, fasted, 1 x 100 mg tablet) and relative bioavailability of the two fasted 
groups (Group 3, 4 x 25 mg tablets vs. Group 1, 1 x 100 mg tablet) will be assessed using an analysis 
of varia nce (ANOVA) approach.

Page 1 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background Information  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and the applicable regulatory requirement(s). 
A brief overview of available confidential information regarding TBAJ -876 is 
summarized  below from the Investigator’s Brochure.
1 Unless noted otherwise, the 
information in this introduction was provided by [CONTACT_625968]. 
1.2 Tuberculosis and Rationale for New Medication  
Current tuberculosis ( TB) treatment regimens are lengthy in duration and involve 
multi-drug therapy. High rates of noncompliance are common, which often result in 
increased mortality and chronic, infectious, drug- resistant cases. The present TB 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_625930]-sensitive or drug- resistant TB that are safe and 
well tolerated and will shorten the overall treatment duration required for cure. In addition, new TB drugs and regimens should be affordable, easy to adopt and implement, suitable for pediatric use and for co- administration with antiretroviral 
therapy in individuals co- infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (Mtb) and human 
immunodeficiency virus ( HIV).  
Bedaquiline is a firs t-in-class diarylquinoline TB drug approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration ( FDA ) for use as part of a combination therapy in adults with 
pulmonary multidrug- resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) when an effective treatment 
regimen cannot otherwise be provided. TBAJ-876 is a preclinical drug candidate from the TB Alliance’s efforts to develop a safer diarylquinoline (DARQ) with the potential to safely deliver superior efficacy to bedaquiline (BDQ), as part of novel TB treatment regimens. Current data suggest that TBAJ -[ADDRESS_833965] significant advantages over BDQ. In particular, TBAJ-876 demonstrates a low risk of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation (whereas QTc prolongation is observed with BDQ), a higher predicted clearance than BDQ (greater suitability for daily dosing), and lower minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Mtb. In preclinical models of TB, TBAJ-[ADDRESS_833966] Phase 1 safety, tolerability and pharmacokineti c (PK) studies. 
This first -in-human (FIH) study is planned to be a randomized, combined s ingle 
ascending dose (SAD) s tudy with a food-e ffect cohort (Part 1) and m ultiple a scending 
dose (MAD)  study (Part  2). In addition, a Part 3 will be included that is an open- label 
study to determine the relative bioavailability (BA) of two strengths of TBAJ -
876tablet s.  
1.3 Preclinical Studies and Toxicity Studies  
In primary pharmacology studies, TBAJ-876 had clear and potent anti- mycobacterial 
activity in vitro and in animal models; therefore, it is a good candidate for clinical 
investigation.  
Secondary and safety pharmacology studies suggest that, at the dose levels proposed for evaluation in human subjects, TBAJ-[ADDRESS_833967] characterized the toxicity profile of TBAJ -876 in rats 
and dogs. This information has been used to identify potential adverse effects in human subjects and inform the dose-escalation schedule and clinical safety monitoring plan. 
In rats dosed for 13 weeks, the dose- limiting toxicities were diarrhea and skeletal 
muscle damage. Microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], skeletal muscle fiber degeneration/necr osis was 
present in multiple muscles of about 1/3
rd of the rats after 13  weeks at 25  mg/kg/day or 
after up to 16 days at 60 mg/kg/day but in no rat after 13 weeks at 10 mg/kg/day. Muscle damage was accompanied by [CONTACT_625969]; e.g., by [CONTACT_625970], AST, and ALT activities and high serum potassium and phosphorus concentrations. Muscle damage was reversible, as it was absent after a 10- or 13-week recovery period.   
In dogs dosed for 13 weeks, no dose- limiting toxicity was seen, but cardiac muscle 
damage was present microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] (as cardiac muscle fiber necrosis/infiltrate) in all 
but one dog at 15 mg/kg/day but in no dogs at ≤7.5 mg/kg/day. While this can be an incidental background finding in dogs, the high incidence of this finding at 15 mg/kg/day was considered to be related to TBAJ-876, in part because the finding was accompanied by [CONTACT_625971] I concentration. Cardiac muscle damage was reversible, as it was absent after a 13 -week recovery per iod. 
Various other TBAJ-876-related findings were seen in one of both species. These included: 
42
Protocol TBAJ -876-CL-001 version 8.0 
Global Alliance for TB Drug Development  CONFIDENTIAL  03 Dec 2021  
Page 3 • Microscopic findings in the glandular mucosa of the stomach in both species,  
• Effects on intestinal function (diarrhea) in both species,  
• Effects on the liver in  both species,  
• Decreased hematopoiesis in dogs,  
• Effects on the incisors in rats,  
• Effects on the lacrimal glands in rats,  
• Increased serum amylase concentration in dogs.   
In the glandular stomach, hyperplasia was seen in several rats after 13 weeks at 
25 mg/kg/day or after two weeks at 60 mg/kg/day. This finding was reversible, as it was absent after a 10 - or 13-week recovery period. Degeneration/necrosis was seen in 
two rats after 13 weeks at 25 mg/kg/day and several rats after two weeks at 60 mg/kg/da y. At the end of the recovery period, degeneration/necrosis also was 
present in two rats that had been given TBAJ-876 for 13 weeks at 25 mg/kg/day. Finally, erosion of the pyloric mucosa in one rat after 13 weeks at 25 mg/kg/day.  
In dogs, m inimal to moder ate degeneration/atrophy of the fundic glands  in the stomach 
was seen in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_625931] 2  weeks at 15 or 45 mg/kg/day. This was characterized 
by [CONTACT_625972], dilated glands with attenuated 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and occasional glands with luminal cell debris. When minimal, the primary alteration was individual cell necrosis of chief cells with infrequent, minimally dilated glands. The grade of fundic gland degeneration/atrophy increased with dose level. Stomach findings were not seen in 8 dogs given daily oral doses of TBAJ-876 for 13 weeks at 15 mg/kg (the highest dose level tested). One possible explanation is that the [ADDRESS_833968] will be made with TBAJ-876 tartrate, which produced no stomach findings in dogs dosed daily for 13 weeks. 
Diarrhea was seen in rats given t wo doses of TBAJ-876, approximately 24 hours apart, 
at ≥ 500 mg/kg in a micronucleus study and also during the second week of dosing at 
60 mg/kg/day in the 13 -week study. At 60 mg/kg/day, diarrhea was accompanied by 
[CONTACT_625973], and contributed to the decision to stop dosing early 
at this dose level. Diarrhea resolved when dosing stopped. In dogs in the 13- week 
study, the frequency of discolored, mucoid or with mucous, watery, and/or soft feces was greater at 15 mg/kg/day than in the control group, but this difference was not clearly related to TBAJ -876. 
Effects on the liver in rats were limited to single -cell vacuolar degeneration or necrosis 
of hepatocytes and/or vacuolation of periportal hepatocytes in a few females after 
43
Protocol TBAJ -876-CL-001 version 8.0 
Global Alliance for TB Drug Development  CONFIDENTIAL  03 Dec 2021  
Page 4 16 days a t 60 mg/kg/day. This finding resolved when dosing stopped, although at the 
end of the recovery phase, single cell necrosis was present in one male that had been 
given TBAJ-876 for 16 days at 60 mg/kg/day. In dogs dosed for [ADDRESS_833969] dose level (25 mg /kg/day), these findings were not considered adverse because they were not 
associated with clinical pathologic or microscopic evidence of hepatocellular degeneration or necrosis. At ≥7.5 mg/kg/day, mean serum ALT activity was increased after 4 and 13 weeks of dosing, but there still was no microscopic evidence of hepatocellular injury.   
Evidence of decreased hem atopoiesis was seen in dogs dosed for 13 weeks, where the 
incidence and average grade of decreased cellularity in sternal bone marrow was 
greater at 15 mg/kg/day. This microscopic finding was not associated with any changes in peripheral blood cell counts and was absent after a 13 -week recovery period. 
In female dogs, mean serum amylase concentration was slightly greater after 4 and 13 weeks of dosing at 15 mg/kg/day, without associated microscopic findings in the pancreas.  
Two findings related to TBAJ-876 were seen only in rats and are of questionable relevance for humans:  
• Degeneration/necrosis of ameloblasts was present in the incisors of rats dosed for 13 weeks. At 25 mg/kg/day, four rats also had acute inflammation in the nasal cavity (near tooth root), one rat also had pulp cavity necrosis, another had moderate periodontal inflammation, and a third had mild acute gingivitis. These dental findings were reversible, as they were absent at the end of the 13-week recovery period. While the effects on incisors were clearly adverse in rats, it is unclear if these findings are relevant for human subjects, because the incisors of rats grow continuously throughout life, unlike human teeth. The teeth were not examined microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_625932] 13 weeks; however, there was no clinical evidence of an effect on teeth, nor were there any findings involving the teeth or oral cavity at necropsy.  
• In the lacrimal glands of rats dosed for 13 weeks, the average grade of acinar cell alteration (characterized by [CONTACT_625974]) was 
greater at all dose levels. After 13  weeks at 25  mg/kg/day, a few rats also had 
lacrimal gland atrophy. The differences in grade showed evidence of reversing when dosing stopped. Acinar cell alteration is a rodent-specific finding, and so it is unclear if an increase in this finding implies a risk for human subjects. There were no effects on lacrimal glands in dogs dosed for 13 weeks.

Cardiovascular Function 
In surgically instrumented dogs given repeated doses of TBAJ-876 for 12 days at 
escalating dose levels up to 30 mg/kg/day, there was no effect on blood pressure, heart rate, PR or QT interval duration, QRS complex duration, or qualitative aspects of the electrocardiogram  (ECG ).  There were slight decreases in QTc interval duration at 
30 mg/kg/ day, but these appeared to be driven by [CONTACT_625975]; therefore, the no observed a dverse 
event l evel ( NOAEL ) for effects on cardiovascular function was 30 mg/kg/day. Plasma

Nervous System Function  
As part of the 13-week general toxicology study in which rats were given daily oral doses of TBAJ-876, functional observational battery (FOB) testing was conducted on 10 rats/sex at approximately 8 hours after the 13th dose. Rats tolerated daily oral doses of TBAJ -876 for 13 weeks at 10 or 25 mg/kg but not at 60 mg/kg, where dosing was 
stopped after [ADDRESS_833972] results; therefore, 2 -week NOAEL for effects on nervous

1.[ADDRESS_833976] Metabolism in Animals  
Absorption 
Following intravenous (IV) administration, TBAJ-876 exhibited low clearance and a large volume of distribution (≥9.45 L/kg). The plasma disposition of TBAJ -876 in 
nonclinical species was multiexponential and due to differences in PK  sampling 
schedule, esti mates of terminal half -life (t
1/2) of TBAJ -876 varied widely, ranging from 
5 to 12 hr (sampling out to 24 hr postdose) to 26 to 77 hr (sampling out to 96 hr postdose). 
TBAJ -876 free base had good oral bioavailability ranging from  36% to 44% in rodents, 
28% to 80% in dogs, and 19% to 24% in monkeys, despi[INVESTIGATOR_625936] -2 cell monolayer. Based on the efflux ratio of 0.2 in Caco-2 cells, TBAJ-876 was 
not a substrate of efflux pumps.

Page 8 When TBAJ-876 was orally administered as tartrate salt to nonclinical species in the 
fasted state, C max increased 40% to 70% and AUC 0-t increased 39% to 59% in rats and 
dogs, whereas in monkeys C max and AUC 0-t decreased 43% and 49%, respectively. 
The in vivo exposure to two active metabolites, TBAJ-876-M2 and TBAJ-876-M3, was quantified in the PK and toxicokinetic ( TK) studies. At the NOAELs in the 13- week 
toxicology studies in the rat and dog, the steady state AUC of TBAJ-876-M3 was 0.6x and 1.8x of parent AUC, respectively, while TBAJ-876- M2 was present at lower 
concentrations with AUC representing 0.[ADDRESS_833977] dose of 4 -week dosing at 3.125 mg/kg, steady state plasma 
exposure to TBAJ-876 and metabolites was approximately 0.4x of that of BDQ and metabolite at 25 mg/kg. After 6 weeks dosing in a mouse model of chronic TB, 3.125 mg/kg TBAJ -876 showed superior efficacy to 25 mg/kg BDQ indicative of TBAJ -876 
being more potent than BDQ ( Table 5 ). TBAJ -876-M3, TBAJ-876-M2, and BDQ-M2

TBAJ -876 and its metabolite TBAJ-876-M3 were not significantly distributed to red 
blood cells. TBAJ-876 and TBAJ-876-M3 were highly protein-bound in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human plasma (≥99.8%) and exhibited a species -independent protein 
binding. At steady state, high concentrations of TBAJ -876 and TBAJ-876- M3 were 
observed in the mouse lung at 2 hr and 24 hr postdose with the lung to plasma

Page 9 concentration ratio for TBAJ-876 and TBAJ-876-M3 in the range of 5 to  7 and 12 to

Metabolism TBAJ -876 and TBAJ-876- M3 were relatively stable metabolically with TBAJ -876 
showing a half-life of >240 min in rat, dog, and human liver microsomes and a half- life 
of 114 and 31 min in monkey and mouse liver microsomes, respectively, and TBAJ-
876-M3 showing a half -life of >240 min in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human liver 
microsomes. The in vitro metabolic stability result is consistent with low in vivo clearance observed. TBAJ -876 was  mainly metabolized by [CONTACT_625977]3A4  followed by [CONTACT_097]2A6, while both CYP3A4 and CYP2A6 play an equal role 
in the metabolism of TBAJ -876-M3. 
In vitro metabolic profile in liver microsomes from nonclinical species and human concluded that TBAJ-876- M3 was the major metabolite and there were no human 
unique metabolites. 
TBAJ -876 showed no or limited inhibition to CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6 and 3A4 activities in human liver microsomes with IC
50 >50 µM. TBAJ -876-M3 
at 30  µM (i.e., nearly 90x the projected TBAJ-876-M3 C max,ss in humans at the 
potentially supra- therapeutic TBAJ -876 dose of 100 mg) caused a maximum 78% 
inhibition of CYP2C19 activity in human liver microsomes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the risk for TBAJ-876 and TBAJ-9876-M3 to cause PK drug interactions  in humans by [CONTACT_625978]. 
The major metabolite TBAJ -876-M3 did not active AhR, CAR, or PXR nuclear 
receptors in vitro. However, TBAJ-876 at 1 µM (i.e., 6 x the projected TBAJ-876 C
max,ss in humans at the potentially therapeutic dose of 25 mg) induced CYP3A4 
mRNA in one of three lots of human hepatocyte s tested . The relevance of this finding 
to the potential for induction in humans will be addressed during an initial clinical development for TBAJ-876.    
In vitro transporter inhibition studies showed that TBAJ -876 at 1 µM did not cause 
notable inhibition of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, or 
MATE2 -K. The IC
50 for BCRP cannot be determined due to insufficient inhibition over 
a concentration r ange of 0.5 to 30 µM. T he IC 50 for P -gp was determined to be 5.08 µM 
based on nominal concentrations, equivalent to approximately 2.30 µM after taking into account the non- specific binding . Cautions will be exercised in subjects who are 
enrolled in the clinica l programs for TBAJ-876 and requiring concomitant medication 
with digoxin.

Page 10 1.6 Potential Adverse Effects in Human Subjects  
Based on the nonclinical safety studies, human subjects should be monitored for the 
following potential effects :   
• Myocardial damage (see n in dogs) by [CONTACT_625979]  
• Skeletal muscle myopathy (seen in rats) by [CONTACT_625980]  
• Damage to the stomach mucosa (seen in both species) by [CONTACT_625981] o f 
nausea, vomiting, or dyspepsia 
• Diarrhea (seen in both species) 
• Liver injury, both hepatocellular and biliary (seen in both species) by [CONTACT_625979]  
• Effects on hematopoiesis (seen in dogs) by [CONTACT_625982] 
• Effects on the pancreas (seen in dogs) by [CONTACT_625983], all of these effects were reversible when dosing stopped, and they are expected to be so in humans, too, if they occur. 
No studies have been done to evaluate the potential effec ts of TBAJ -876 reproductive 
function in male animals. The following side effects were noted in adult 
subjects/patients in studies of a similar drug in this class (bedaquiline - marketed as Sirturo
TM): nausea, t iredness , headache, vomiting , dizziness , diarrhea, l iver injury , heart 
problems; prolongation of QTc interval, and pancreas injury . 2  
Clinical Safety Evaluation (Single Ascending Dose) 
In the SAD part of TBAJ-876 CL-001, 47 healthy volunteers aged 20 to 50 years were 
dosed with a single dose of TBAJ -876 or placebo and followed up to Week 4 (Cohorts 
1 through 3) or up to Week 10 (Cohorts 4 through 6) after dosing . Each cohort enrolled 8 subjects (6 randomized to active treatment and 2 to placebo), except for Cohort 4, which enrolled only [ADDRESS_833978], based on preclinical findi ngs, included myocardial damage, skeletal 
muscle injury, gastrointestinal irritation, elevated pancreatic enzymes, elevated liver enzymes, and cytopenia. 
1) There were 3 subjects with elevated lipase (1 in the 10 mg cohort, and 2 in the 50 mg cohort) and 1 with elevated amylase (50 mg), who also had an elevated lipase. These laboratory abnormalities were not associated with any symptoms and resolved completely.

Page 11 2) Two subjects with elevated liver enzymes (10 mg). These laboratory abnormalities 
were not associat ed with any symptoms and resolved completely.  
3) One subject in the 25 mg cohort experienced rhabdomyolysis 9 days after dosing, 
deemed related to physical exertion and not to study drug.  
4) Treatment with TBAJ -[ADDRESS_833979] in Cohort 6 (400 mg) had an epi[INVESTIGATOR_43180]- sustained ventricular tachycardia 
observed in the Holter extraction on Study Day 1, approximately [ADDRESS_833980] reported a few seconds of “more prominent heartbeat” at the same time. There were no symptoms of chest pain, syncope, or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], and her physical examination and vital signs were normal. No QT prolongation was observed on the Holter or in subsequent ECGs. This event was reported as “possibly related”. Another subject in Cohort 6 had a mildly elevated 
troponin I on Day 21, with a value of 0.038 ng/mL, confirmed at 0.034 ng/mL (ULN 0.028 ng/mL). The subject was completely asymptomatic , and her physical 
examination, vital signs, and ECG were normal. On the same day of the troponin I elevation, her CPK and CPK-Mb were also normal. The subject returned to the clinic on Study Day 23, and her troponin I levels were within the normal range. The finding of elevated troponin I on Study Day 21 was deemed by [CONTACT_625958] “spurious”. 
Based on a review of the blinded data from the SAD part of the study, there was no evidence of myocardial, skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal, hepatic, or hematological toxicity associated with single doses of TBAJ -876 between 10 mg and 400 mg. There 
were no clinically significant changes from baseline in vital signs and ECG's including no prolongation of QTc's.  
While there were a few subjects w ith mild to moderate elevations in amylase and/or 
lipase, these abnormalities did not appear to be dose-dependent, were not associated 
with a ny symptomatology, and resolved rapi[INVESTIGATOR_625937]. The 
potential adverse effects of TBAJ -876 in human subjects will be further investigated in 
the MAD part of the study, where subjects will receive treatment with multiple ascending doses of the drug for 14 consecutive days. 
1.7 Rationale for Dose Selection (MAD)  
A mathematical model for the PK of TB AJ-[ADDRESS_833981] cohort was predicted to remain below those thresholds.   
Upon review of the MAD Cohort 1 (25 mg) PK and safety, the 50 mg dose planned for Cohort 2 was changed to 75 mg. This decision was made based on the safety of the 25 mg dose which was shown to be safe and well tolerated without evidence of cardiac, muscle skeletal, gastroi ntestinal, hepatic, or hematological toxicity, and because the 
total exposure of TBAJ-876 plus M3 at the dose of 75 mg was predicted to still remain below thresholds determined by [CONTACT_625984]- month toxicity 
study in dogs.

The primary objective of the study is: 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of 
TBAJ -876 oral suspension, and single doses of two strengths of TBAJ -876 tablet s 
in healthy subjects.  
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TBAJ-876 and its metabolites (M2 and M3) after single and multiple doses of TBAJ-876 oral suspension, and single doses of
 two strengths of TBAJ -876 tablets in healthy adult subjects. 
• To compare the rate and extent of absorption of a single oral dose of TBAJ-876 oral suspension and two strengths of TBAJ -876 tablets when administered after a 
high-calorie, high- fat meal versus when it  is administered fasting in healthy adult 
subjects.  
• To compare the rate and extent of absorption of the 4 x 25 mg tablets and the 1 x 
100 mg tablet under fasted conditions.  
• To compare the rate and extent of absorption of a single oral dose of 100 mg of 
the TBAJ -876 oral suspension and two strengths of TBAJ -876 tablet s under fed 
and/or fasted conditions. 
3 STUDY DESIGN SUMMARY  
This study is a three -part, partially blinded, placebo controlled, combined single 
ascending dose (SAD) with food- effect , multiple ascending dose (MAD) study, and a 
single dose relative bioavailability ( BA) study conducted in one study center in the 
[LOCATION_002].   
Safety will be assessed throughout the study for all subjects. Safety assessments will include physical examination s, vital signs,  serial  ECGs , cardiac monitoring, adverse 
events ( AEs), and clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, serum chemist ry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis).  
Part 1:  
Part [ADDRESS_833982] 
cohort is planned with two parallel groups, one fasting and the other fed.

Page 14 Current duration and scheduling of safety and PK sampling assumes  that the terminal 
half-life (T1/2) will be approximately [ADDRESS_833983] 24 hours prior (from Day -1), until 
7 days after dosing (Day 8) .  
Subjects  from Dose Level [ADDRESS_833984] subsequent follow up safety 
(collection o f AEs) and PK assessments on Days 10, 14, 17, 21, and 28.  
Food- Effect : Based on exposure levels from the first [ADDRESS_833985] cohort will receive active drug  of TBAJ -876, 100 mg.  
Note: PK sampling for making a decision on escalating to the next dose will be through the morning trough sample of Day 8, and a dose escalation meeting will take place around Day 15  when interim PK data is  available from the bioanalytical lab . Therefore , 
the dose escalati on meeting and decision will be based on PK through the morning of 
Day 8 and a pproximately 14 days of safety data, depending on the turnaround time of 
the bioanalysis. Subjects will continue to be monitored for PK and safety up to 10 weeks or longer after the dose. The duration of the follow-up period will be based on the analysis o f interim PK data. Available subjects from Cohorts 4 and 5, and all 
subjects in Cohort 6 will be asked to return bi- weekly (+/ - 2 days) up to [ADDRESS_833986] . 
Dose escalation to the next cohort (i.e., dose level) or any changes to  PK sampling and 
safety assessment timepoints will not take place until the Sponsor, in conjunction with the Princip al Investigator and Dose Escalation Committee, has determined that 
adequate safety, tolerability and PK from the previous cohort have been demonstrated to permit proceeding to the next cohort.

Page 15 Additional cohort, Cohort 7: Eight (8) subjects will be enrolled, 6 to receive active drug 
and 2 to receive placebo. Subjects will receive a single dose under fasted conditions. 
Subjects will receive 800 mg TBAJ-876 or matching dose of placebo for TBAJ-876 Oral Suspension. 
Subjects will follow the procedures in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 5) with the 
following clarifications:  
Subjects will check -in to the clinic on Day - [ADDRESS_833987] triplicate ECGs at 16 hours postdose. 
Additional cohorts may be enrolled if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_625966] a dose level , to study another dose level, or to increase cohort size (subject numbers). 
The number and timing of PK sampling and safety assessments may be further revised based on what is learned based on evolving data PK information. 
These decisions concerning additional cohorts will not take place until the Sponsor, in 
conjunction with the Principal Investigator, has determined that adequate safety, tolerability, and PK  from the previous cohorts have been demonstrated. The 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) should be immediately notified of this revised approach. 
During each coh ort, blood samples will be obtained before each dose of study drug, and 
at serial timepoints postdose on Days 1-8, 10, 14, 17, 21, and 28. Plasma PK  samples 
will be analyzed for TBAJ -876, M2, and M3 using validated analytical methods. 
Appropriate PK  parameters will be calculated using non-compartmental methods. 
In addition, blood and urine will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations. 
Female subjects will have blood collected for serum pregnancy testing. Females 
claiming postmenopausal status will have blood col lected to measure 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) levels.

cohort if any safety signal/concern arises , or, if the food effect is assessed by [CONTACT_625985] a single cohort, after the dosing of that cohort in the fasting state. 
Dose Escalation Review  
A rev iew period will take place after the dosing of all subjects in each cohort in order 
evaluate and interpret all PK  and safety data collected.  The review of all pertinent 
blinded safety/tolerability data will include physical examinations, ECGs , vital signs,  
clinical laboratory tests, cardiac monitoring, and AEs or serious adverse events  (SAEs)  
through approximately Day 14 (SAD) and Day 21 (MAD) . Also, data from the current 
dose cohort and all previous cohorts will be considered .   
The Sponsor and Investigator will determine if there are sufficient data available to 
make a dose escalati on decision. Any AEs of G rade ≥ 2 toxicities (per Division of 
Microbiology and Infectious Disease [DMID] toxicity table; Appendix 3) must be considered in the decision to escalate to the next dose level. PK analysis will be completed on the active treatment subjects and will be blinded by [CONTACT_1130]. 
As data from each cohort is informative for dose escalation decisions in subsequent 
cohorts, review of unblinded data will be conducted after completion of each cohort by [ADDRESS_833995] be a physician. Per protocol, the dose escalation meeting and decision require PK data through the morning of Day 8 and approximately 14 days of safety data, depending on

Page 19 the turnaround time of the bioanalysis. Upon completion of the review, they will 
communicate to the study team modifications, if any, that should be implemented for subsequent cohorts. See unblinding procedures (Section 6.2.6). 
Note : Although safety data for deciding on escalating to the next dose or cohort will be 
through approximately 14 days (SAD, Part 1) or 28 days (MAD, Part
 2), subjects will 
continue to be monitored for safety up to [ADDRESS_833996] dose. The 
duration of the follow-up period will be based on the analysis of interim PK data. For 
Part 1, available subjects from Cohorts 4 and 5, and all subjects in Cohort 6 will be asked to return bi- weekly (+/ - 2 days) up to [ADDRESS_833997] dose and will be asked to return every 3 weeks for an additional follow-up period of 15 weeks  or longer for safety  and PK evaluation.  
Subjects will complete the same procedures as required for Day 21 at each visit.  
Upon review of relevant data, the Sponsor, in conjunction with the Investigator, may decide to:  
1. Escalate the dose as planned.  
2. Evaluate an intermediate dose level prior to proceeding to the next planned dose level if concerns arise from PK and safety that do not warrant ceasing escalation.  
3. Repeat a given dose level in a new cohort of subjects. 
4. Increase the dose of the next cohort if the PK is  lower than expected in the 
previous cohort. 
5. Add a cohort if the PK is lower than expected after a cohort and there are no safety concerns.  
6. Halt the study.  
During the dose -escalation phase of this first clinical trial, escalation will be guided by 
[CONTACT_625986].  
Dose escalation to the next cohort (i.e., dose level) will not take place until the Sponsor, in conjunction with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_625928], has determined that adequate safety, tolerability and PK from t he previous cohort has been 
demonstrated. The IRB will be notified, and the next cohort will start once IRB approval is received .

On Day -1, subjects should fast until lunch to avoid circadian fluctuations. 
For Part 1, continuous 12-lead ECGs (Holter) will be recorded for [ADDRESS_834048] dose. 
For Part 2, continuous 12- lead ECGs (Holter) will begin at least [ADDRESS_834049] dose (D ay 1) and start again at least [ADDRESS_834050] 24 hours after dosing dose 14 (Day 15). 
For Pa rt 3, continuous 12-lead ECGs (Holter) will be recorded for [ADDRESS_834051] 10 minutes.  
NOTE: When ECG extractions from the continuous 12- lead ECGs (Holter) coincide 
with safety ECGs, vital signs assessment and blood draws, procedures should be carried out in said order.   
Details regarding the equipment and methods to be used for continuous Holter 
extraction and analysis are provided in Appendix 4.   
[ADDRESS_834052] medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a trial treatment whether or not considered related to trial treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a trial treatment, whether or not related to the trial treatmen t. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_834053] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death; 
• Is life threatening (any event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_625943]

other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from basel ine is not considered an AE; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; the term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of re latively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption; 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• Is a medically important event.  
Note:  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding which is a medically important event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  A “suspected transmission of infectious agent by a medicinal product” is also considered a serious adverse event under the SAE criterion “Other medically important condition”.  
7.2 Attribution/Causality  
An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicab le product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved 
investigational product). 
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between trial treatment and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to trial treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated. 
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.

Page 42 • For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor/designee. 
However, it is very important that the investigator always assess causality for every 
event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor/designee. 
• The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up 
information and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.

Relatedness Rating  Definition  
Not Related  An adverse event, which is not related to the use of the drug.  
Unlikely  An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, e.g., 
concomitant drug(s) or concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time 
suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely.  
Possible  An adverse event, which might be due to the use of the drug.  An alternative 
explanation, e.g., concomitant drug(s) or concomitant disease(s), is 
inconclusive.  The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore, the causal 
relationship cannot be excluded.  
Probable  An adverse event, which might be due to the use of the drug.  The relationship 
in time is suggestive, e.g., confirmed by [CONTACT_23827].  An alternative 
explanation is less likely, e .g., concomitant drug(s) or concomitant disease(s).  
Certain  An adverse event, which is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g., concomitant drug(s) or 
concomitant disease(s).

7.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
Changes in the results of the Clinical Laboratory assessment results which the Investigator feels are clinically significant will be reported as AEs. It is the 
Investigators’ responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as  they become 
available. This review must be documented by [CONTACT_32366]’ dated signature [CONTACT_444495]. For each abnormal laboratory test result, the Investigator needs to ascertain and document if this is a clinically significant change from baseline fo r that 
individual participant. This determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnormal value is observed. The Investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory tests. All laboratory changes greater than or equal to Grade [ADDRESS_834058] becomes

will complete the same procedures as required for Day 28 at each visit.  
**  Subjects in Cohort 7  will be discharged from the clinic on Day 8. Subjects will return for one follow -up visit on Day 14 for PK and safety. 
Subjects will re ceive a follow -up phone call on Day 21. Subjects will complete the procedures specified for those study days only.  
a. The 16 -hour time point following dosing on Day 1 will either be on Day 1 or Day 2, depending upon time of dosing on Day 1.  
b. Heart Murmur: Presence of heart murmur  
c. Vital signs (blood pressure, pule rate, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and pulse oximetry) will be measured at screening  and check -in 
(Day -1). Vitals signs will be  measured within [ADDRESS_834067] 2  minutes and then again after standing for 1 minute, except when they are supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -reclined because of study 
procedures and/or AEs , or as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737].  
d. 12-lead safety ECGs will be printed and reviewed on -site by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_1461]. Triplicate ECGs will be completed at 
screening, Day - 1, at [ADDRESS_834068] dose QTcF  >500  msec or a change -from -baseline QTcF >[ADDRESS_834069] triplicate ECGs at 16 hours postdose.  
e. Safety laboratory assessments  will be done at check -in (Day -1), 6 and 48 hours postdose and on Days 5, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, and 28. The 
following analyses will be performed:  
• Full blood cell count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential,  reticulocyte count, 
platelet count), reticulocyte count  
• Coagulation Tests: Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT2), Prothrombin time (PT2)  
• Clinical Chemistry (albumin, serum urea, creatinine, direct, indirect , and total bilirubin, uric acid, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium (corrected for albumin), 
chloride, magnesium, glucose, bicarbonate/CO2, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) , creatine phosphokinase myocardial band (CPK -MB) ,

• Other laboratory tests: cardiac troponin I and glycosylated hemoglobin 
• Urinalysis (pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, micro -albumin, ketones, bilirubin, creatinine, nitrite, sodium, urobilinogen, 
myoglobin, blood, leukocytes).  If protein, occult blood, nitrite, or leukocyte esterase values are out of range, a microscopic 
examination will be performed. Myoglobin  will be collected but results will not be required for dose qualification.  
f. Female subjects will have a urine pregnancy test at the end -of-study on Day [ADDRESS_834070] reporting. A specific inquiry regarding AEs will be co nducted prior to dosing and at time points specified postdose and upon return 
to clinic for subsequent visits.  
h. TBAJ -876 or Placebo for TBAJ -876 Oral Suspension will be administered orally followed by 240 mL of water. Listerine® strips will be 
used as a blinding agent. A strip will be added to the subject’s tongue before and after each dose.  
i. Subjects will be followed up for safety and PK during follow -up at the following timepoints: Dose Level 1 : PK samples to be collected at 
pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 80, 88, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours after dosing, 
then on Days 10, 14, 17, 21 and 28.  Other Dose Level Cohorts:  scheduling of PK sample collection will be based on the PK data 
collected from previous cohorts and could involve a different sampling schedule and require subjects return to the clinic for up to 10 wee ks 
or longer after dosing.  
j. Continuous 12- lead Holter recording (cardiac telemetry ) will begin [ADDRESS_834071] -dosing QTcF >500 msec or a change -from -
baseline QTcF >60 msec, after repeat testing, additional ECGs should be recorded until normalization or return to baseline.

Page 78 APPENDIX 4 HOLTER RECORDING AND ANALYSIS  
Continuous 12- lead ECGs (Holters) will be recorded using the Mortara Surveyor system.  
The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will b e stored and transmitted to iCardiac using the 
appropriate medium (e.g., file transfer protocol [FTP], disc, or flash drive) . ECGs to be used in 
the analyses will be selected by [CONTACT_094]-determined time points as defined in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures, and will be read centrally by [CONTACT_626003], Inc.  
The following principals will be followed in iC ardiac’s core laboratory:  
• ECG analysts are blinded to the subject, visit and treatment allocation  
• Baseline and on -treatment ECGs for a particular subject will be over -read on the same 
lead and will be analyzed by [CONTACT_336601].  
• The primary analysis lead is lead II. If lead II is not analyzable, then primary lead of 
analysis will be  changed to another lead for the entire subject data set.  
 
The following is a brief description of ECG analysis methods utilized by [CONTACT_626004]’ core laboratory. 
TQT Plus ECG Extra ction Technique  
Ten 14-second digital 12- lead ECG tracings will be extracted from the continuous Holter 
recordings us ing the “TQT Plus method”, a computer- assisted and statistical process utilized by 
[CONTACT_626003]. The method enables extraction of ECGs with the lowest HR variability 
and noise within the protocol-specified extraction time window (e.g., the HR and QT changes from beat -to-beat in the range of <10%). At each protocol-specified timepoint, 10 ECG 
replicates will be extracted from a 5 -minute “ECG window” (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the last [ADDRESS_834121] is maintained in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662]-recumbent quiet position). 
High -Precision QT Analysis  
High -precision QT analysis will be performed on all analyzable (non- artifact) b eats in the 
10 ECG replicates. Statistical quality control procedures are used to review and assess all beats 
and identify “high” and “low” confidence beats using several criteria, including: 
• QT or QTc values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely). 
• RR values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely). 
• Rapid changes in QT, QTc or RR from beat to beat. 
Measurements of all primary ECG parameters (QT, QTc, RR) in all recorded beats of all replicates that are deemed “high  confidence” is pe rformed using COMPAS software. All low 
confidence beats are reviewed manually and adjudicated using pass -fail criteria. The final QC 
assessment is performed by a cardiologist. The beats found acceptable by [CONTACT_626005]. The median QT, QTc, and RR value from each extracted replicate is 
[ADDRESS_834122]’s reportable value at that timepoint.  
Categorical T -wave morphology analysi s and the measurement of PR and QRS intervals will be 
performed manually in 3 of the 10 ECG replicates at each timepoint.  Each fiducial point (onset of P-wave, onset of Q-wave, offset of S- wave, and offset of T -wave) is electronically marked.  
T-wave morphology categories (assessed manually) 
Category  Description  
Normal T -wave  Any T -wave not meeting any criterion below  
Flat T -waves T amplitude < 1 mm (either positive or negative) including flat 
isoelectric line  
Notched T -wave (+)  Presence of notch(es) of at least 0.[ADDRESS_834123] 0.1 mV deep (both positive and negative/positive and polyphasic T-waves included)  
Normal T -wave ( -) T amplitude that is negative, without biphasic T-wave or notches 
Notched T -wave ( -) Presence of notch(es) of at least 0.[ADDRESS_834124] categorical analysi s, the presence of abnormal U-waves is noted.

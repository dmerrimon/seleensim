Title:  A  Validation of the Acumen™ Assisted  Fluid Management (AFM)  
Short Title:  AFM Study 
Purpose:  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the Acumen™ 
Assisted Fluid Management (AFM) Feature  in its ability to predict a subjec t’s fluid 
responsiveness. The validity of the fluid bolus recommendation will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_396393] a stroke volume response meeting the set fluid strategy.  
Subject s enrolled in the validation study will have their fluid management decisions guided 
by [CONTACT_396394].  The decision to provide fluid as recommended  by [CONTACT_396395].  When a fluid recommendation is made by [CONTACT_3433] e 
AFM Feature, the investigator will assess the subjec t holistically prior to accepting or 
declining the system recommendation.

Endpoints:  Primary effectiveness endpoint:  
Evaluate the performance of the AFM feature in its ability to predict the fluid 
responsiveness of a subject . 
Primary safety endpoint: 
The primary safety endpoint is the assessment of serious adverse events which may be 
related to the Acumen™ Assisted Fluid Management Feature.
